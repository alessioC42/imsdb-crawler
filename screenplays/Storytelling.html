<b>t
</b><b>tINT. MARCUS'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tThe time is circa 1985.
<b>t
</b>tVi and Marcus finish making love. Marcus has cerebral palsy.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttHey, you want to hear my short t
ttstory now?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttHuh?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttt(lifts a MS from a shelf by his bed)
ttI can read it to you.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttYou mean, again?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttWell, I changed the ending a t
ttlittle.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttOh. What happens now?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttWell, actually, it's the same, but 
ttlonger. I think it's better. 
ttMore...raw.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttWell then, maybe you should just t
ttread the ending.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttBut it won't make any sense if you 
tthear it out of context.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttI think you should leave it the t
ttway it was. It was good.
<b>ttt
</b>tPause.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttSo you don't want to hear my new t
ttending?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttYou'll read it in class tomorrow. t
ttSurprise me.
ttt(beat)
ttAnyway, I have to go. I promised t
ttMelinda I'd help her with her 
ttoral.
<b>ttt
</b>tShe rises, starts dressing.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttYou're tired of me. I can tell.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttMarcus, I'm tired. That's all.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttYou've lost interest...You hardly t
tteven sweat any more when we 
tthave sex.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttI was never much of a sweater. You 
ttknow that.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttLook, Vi, I don't blame you. You t
ttfeel You feel pity now. The 
ttpleasure isn't there any more. The 
ttkinkiness has gone...You've 
ttbecome kind. 
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. CAMPUS GREEN - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tIt is bright and sunny.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. MR SCOTT'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tMr Scott, who is black, presides over his class. Marcus is 
treading from his story, Vi at his side. Catherine, a stunning 
tintellectual, sits near the teacher. The rest of the students 
t(Amy, Elli, etc.) listen closely and take notes.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>tt"...but when he saw her...it was t
ttas if he could walk like a 
ttnormal person. His legs didn't t
ttswing, his arms didn't spaz 
ttaway...He wasn't a freak any more, 
ttfor she made him forget his 
ttaffliction. No more cerebral t
ttpalsy! From now on  "CP" stood 
ttfor...cerebral person. He was a t
ttcerebral person.
<b>ttt
</b>tPause. Marcus and Vi exchange looks.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttAMY
</b>ttI thought it was really good, t
ttMarcus...Really moving and 
ttemotional.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttELLI
</b>ttYeah, I thought it was really t
ttemotional, too.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttAMY
</b>ttAnd I mean, really good word t
ttchoices. It kind of reminded me a 
ttlittle of Faulkner, but East Coast 
ttand disabled.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLUCY
</b>ttOr Flannery O'Connor. She had t
ttmultiple sclerosis.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttAnd Borges. He was blind.
<b>tttt
</b>tPause.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttETHAN
</b>ttUpdike has psoriasis.
<b>t
</b>tPause.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttUm...Maybe I'm wrong, but, um, I'm 
ttafraid I found the whole thing to t
ttbe a little trite. Its earnestness 
ttis, well...it's a little t
ttembarrassing. And those 
ttadjectives, they're a little t
ttflatfooted. And redundant. I'm t
ttsorry, but...Anyway, what do I t
ttknow? Don't even listen to what I t
ttsay. I mean...
<b>ttt
</b>tPause.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttAnyone else?
<b>ttt
</b>tNo response.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttCatherine is right. The story's a t
ttpiece of shit. You express nothing 
ttbut banalities and, formally t
ttspeaking, are unable to construct t
tta single compelling sentence. You t
ttride on a wave of clichxe9s so worn, 
ttin fact, it actually approaches a t
ttlevel of grotesquerie. Ad your t
ttsubtitle, 'the rawness of truth' t
ttis that supposed to be a joke of t
ttsome sort? Or are you just being t
ttpretentious?
ttt(beat; then checking his class book) 
ttOK. Who's next?
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. CAMPUS COURTYARD - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tMarcus, upset, rushes outside, Vi in pursuit, desperately trying to 
tconsole.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttMarcus, wait up!
<b>ttt
</b>tMarcus stops.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttWhat do you want?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttDon't be so upset. It's OK...
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttWhat the fuck are you talking t
ttabout? What's OK?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttt(beat)
ttYou know he hated my story also.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttYour story was terrible!
<b>ttt
</b>tHe moves on, she keeps up with him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttMarcus...You'll write something t
ttbetter next time!
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttPatronizing fuck! If you had just t
ttbeen honest with me in the first t
ttplace I wouldn't have read it. I t
ttknew it was shit. But - idiot! - I 
ttbelieved you!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttThat's not fair! I was honest! t
ttJust because I wasn't sucking up t
ttlike tthat bitch Catherine.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttWell, I sure didn't hear you voice 
ttyour opinion in there when it t
ttmattered.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttI admit it - I was scared! I was t
ttshocked, in fact , by what he t
ttsaid. And he's so...convincing. t
ttI'm sorry if I let you down, but t
ttreally, I still say he's just t
ttone opinion. I don't even like his 
ttbooks that much. They're all so t
ttaggressively confrontational. I t
ttdon't care if he's won the t
ttPulitzer Prize.
<b>t
</b>tCatherine and Mr Scott walk by together in the distance.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttYou just want to fuck him. Like t
ttCatherine and every other white t
ttcunt on campus.
<b>ttt
</b>tHe leaves her.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. VI AND MELINDA'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMelinda lies on her bed with some homework, watching Vi.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI (O.S)
</b>ttt(on phone)
tt...But Marcus! You can't just t
ttunilaterally decide to end things. 
ttThis is a relationship we're t
tttalking about! A friendship! You t
ttdon't just...Fuck you!
<b>t
</b>tShe hangs up and enters her bedroom, in tears.
<b>t
</b>ttttVI(cont'd)
ttFuck him! Fuck him! Fuck him...
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMELINDA
</b>ttVi? Are you OK?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttYes. I'm OK. I'm totally OK.
<b>ttt
</b>tMelinda rises, puts a hand on her shoulder.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMELINDA
</b>ttYou did the right thing.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttI know that. Fucking cripple. Why t
ttdo I waste my time with t
ttundergrads? They're all t
ttso...juvenile! Uch! I just thought 
ttMarcus would be different. I t
ttmean he's got CP!
<b>t
</b>tPause.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMELINDA
</b>ttWhat are you gonna do now?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttI dunno...go to a bar...get t
ttlaid...whatever...Don't worry t
ttabout me. I'll be fine...
<b>t
</b>tShe starts changing into a new outfit.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. BAR - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tStudents hang around outside. Vi goes inside. 
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. BAR - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tVi walks up to the bar.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttCan I have a beer? 
<b>ttt
</b>tAfter getting her beer, Vi turns around and suddenly notices Mr Scott, 
twho is sitting alone. She goes over to him.
<b>t
</b>ttttVI(cont'd)
ttHi.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttHello, Vi.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttWhat are you doing here?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttWhat are you doing here?
<b>ttt
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttI'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just t
ttdidn't expect to run into you t
tthere, that's all.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttWell, now you have.
<b>ttt
</b>tVi laughs, sort of, ten blushes.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttYeah, um, then...are you alone?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttUh huh.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttCan I join you?
<b>ttt
</b>tMr Scott gestures for her to sit down with him.
<b>t
</b>ttttVI(cont'd)
ttGee, thanks. Well, um...I just t
ttwanted to say that I'm really t
tthappy with the class and, t
ttum...I know you must here this all 
ttthe time, but I'm also a t
ttgreat admirer of your work. A t
ttSunday Lynching, t
ttespecially...really, um spoke to t
ttme. God, I hope I'm not t
ttembarrassing you...
<b>ttttttt
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttYou're not.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttGood.
ttt(beat)
tt'Cause I...um...I really agreed t
ttwith everything you had to say t
ttlast week about how bad my story t
ttwas...
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttThat's good.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttAnd I also agreed with what you t
ttsaid today about Marcus's story. t
ttIt is a piece of shit.
<b>ttt
</b>tPause.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttYou have beautiful skin.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttThank you.
ttt(beat)
ttSo Catherine seems like she might t
ttbecome a really good writer.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttMaybe. She's OK.
<b>ttt
</b>tPause.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttAren't you going out with t
ttCatherine?
ttt(beat)
ttI'm sorry. It's none of my t
ttbusiness. I didn't mean...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttI'm not 'going out' with t
ttCatherine.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttOh.
ttt(beat)
ttDo you think I have a potential as 
tta writer?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttNo.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttThank you for being honest.
<b>ttt
</b>tMr Scott leans over and touches her hand.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttI have so much respect for you.
<b>ttt
</b><b>tEXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMr Scott and Vi walk together in silence.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. MR SCOTT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tVi and Mr Scott enter. He turns around and looks at her. Pause.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttCan I just freshen up for a t
ttsecond?
<b>t
</b>tHe indicates the direction of the bathroom.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttIt's over there.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttThanks.
<b>ttt
</b><b>tINT. MR SCOTT'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tVi enters, locks the door behind her. She looks at herself in the 
tmirror, then notices a snapshot of Catherine: she is naked, legs open 
twide. Other erotic photographs lie beneath Catherine's.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttt(to herself, almost chanting)
ttDon't be a racist. Don't be a t
ttracist. Don't be a racist...
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. MR SCOTT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tVi emerges from the bathroom to find Mr Scott lounging on the bed.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttIt's a really nice place you have. 
ttIs the rent high?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttTake off your top.
<b>ttt
</b>tShe obliges.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttNow...take off the rest.
<b>ttt
</b>tShe does, and he looks hard at her. Finally he rises.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttTurn around.
<b>ttt
</b>tShe does.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttBend over.
<b>ttt
</b>tHe starts making love to her, from behind.
<b>t
</b>ttttMR SCOTT(cont'd)
ttt(whispers)
ttSay, 'nigger, fuck me.'
<b>ttt

</b><b>tEXT. MARCUS'S DORMITORY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tLights are out.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. MARCUS'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMarcus looks in the mirror, ponders his reflection.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttFreak.
<b>ttt
</b>tThere is a soft knock at the door. He turns  away from the mirror and 
topens it. Vi is there, teary-eyed, disheveled. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttCan I come in?
<b>ttt
</b>tThey embrace.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttYou're all...sweaty!
<b>ttt
</b><b>tINT. MR SCOTTS CLASSROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tVi finishes reading her story to the class.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>tt'...So John flipped her around and 
ttslammed her against the wall. Jane 
ttbraced herself: she thought about t
tther mother. She thought about t
ttPeter. She thought about God...and 
ttrape. ''Say, 'Fuck me, nigger. t
ttFuck me hard.''' John's flesh t
ttabraded her soft skin. There would 
ttbe marks. She acquiesced, and said 
ttwhat he asked her to say, and did t
ttwhat he asked her to do. She had t
ttentered college with hope, with t
ttdignity, but she would graduate as 
tta whore.'
<b>t
</b>tSilence.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttAMY
</b>ttWhy do people have to be so t
ttugly...write about such ugly t
ttcharacters? It's perverted. I know 
ttyou all think I'm being prisssy, t
ttbut I don't care. I was brought up 
ttin a certain way. And this t
ttis...mean-spirited!
<b>t
</b>tPause.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttYeah, well, it did seem a little t
ttaffected. Like by using taboo t
ttlanguage you were trying to shock t
ttus about the hollowness of your t
ttcharacters.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttETHAN
</b>ttI think it was a little bit t
ttracist.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttELLI
</b>ttIt was completely racist, and t
ttbeyond that I felt deeply offended 
ttas a twoman. As if a woman can t
ttonly operate from experiences of t
ttobjectification.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSUE
</b>ttTotally phallocentric.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttELLI
</b>ttAnd so weirdly misogynistic. I t
ttmean, why does Jane go through t
ttwith this? Is she stupid?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttETHAN
</b>ttHey, But wasn't this a rape? Or t
tt...did I miss something? Because I 
tt- I'm confused. Because if this t
ttwas a rape, then why would she be t
tta whore?
<b>ttttttt
</b><b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttt(beat)
ttIt was confessional, yet t
ttdishonest. Jane pretends to be t
tthorrified by tthe sexuality that t
ttshe in fact fetishizes. She t
ttsubsumes herself to the myth of t
ttblack male potency, but then t
ttdoesn't follow through. She thinks 
ttshe 'respects Afro-Americans,' she 
ttthinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,' t
ttwhat a notch he 'd make in her 
ttbelt, but, of course, it all comes 
ttdown to mandingo clichxe9, and he t
ttcalls her on it. In classic racist 
tttradition she demonizes, then runs 
ttfor cover. But then, how could she 
ttbehave otherwise? She's just a t
ttspoiled suburban white girl with a 
ttBenneton rainbow complex. It's t
ttjust my opinion, and what do I t
ttknow...but I think it's a callow t
ttpiece of writing.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttCallow and coy. Jane wants more, t
ttbut isn't honest enough to admit t
ttit. In the end, she returns to the 
ttsafety of her crippled t
tt(translation: sexually impotent) t
ttboyfriend.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCUS
</b>ttThis is bullshit! Her story was t
ttthe truth!
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttRight.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttSUE
</b>ttIt's unbelievable!
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttELLI
</b>ttIt's clichxe9d!
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttAMY
</b>ttIt's disgusting!
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttVI
</b>ttBut it happened!
<b>ttt
</b>tSilence.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMR SCOTT
</b>ttI don't know about 'what t
tthappened,' Vi, because once you t
ttstart writing, it  all becomes t
ttfiction. Still, it certainly is an 
ttimprovement over your last story: t
ttThere is now at least a beginning, 
tta middle, and an end.

</b>ttUh, well, anyway, so I'm looking t
ttfor subjects for this documentary t
tton teenage life in suburbia. Kind t
ttof an exploration of the mental t
