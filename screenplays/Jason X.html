<b>tJASON-X
</b><b>tBY TOD FARMER
</b><b>tREVISED ROUGH DRAFT
</b><b>tMAY 24, 1999
</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tDARKNESS.
</b>
tA scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO -

tMONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images 
ttaken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths.  

<b>tAGAIN, DARKNESS.
</b>
<b>ttttttttOPEN ON:
</b>
tThe year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a 
thazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of 
tdark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign.

tBLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM 
tbelow. 

tSmall groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work 
tnearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings 
twith strange devices.

tThis is an archeological expedition.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT.  DARK PLACE
</b>
tThe dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small 
tobject buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch 
tand slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool 
tto remove the dirt.

<b>ttttFEMALE VOICE
</b>ttCareful . . .

<b>ttttMALE VOICE
</b>ttI know.

tThey take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE 
tfemale (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely.

<b>ttttSTONEY
</b>ttt(reading)
ttNot guaranteed, if used After 2198.

tCLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom.

<b>ttttADRIENNE
</b>ttt(smiles)
ttYou thinking what I'm thinking?

tStoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open 
tthe condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off.

<b>tPULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
tThey are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging 
tstorm outside and from the raging lust inside.

<b>tBACK INSIDE THE VAN.
</b>
<b>ttttADRIENNE
</b>ttt(breathless)
ttWhat about Kkinsa?

tSTONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra.

<b>ttttSTONEY
</b>ttIt's over between us. You're the
ttonly one for me!

<b>tMETAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES!
</b>
tThey fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them.

<b>tINT.  DARK CORRIDOR
</b>
tA rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover 
teverything. Dead. Lifeless.

<b>ttttSTONEY
</b>ttYou okay?

tAdrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She 
tturns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder.

<b>tSHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.
</b>
tWe PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the 
tstorm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>tEXT.  BASE CAMP
</b>
tThe digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred 
tshuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly.

tFAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of 
tthe shuttle ramp.

<b>ttttFAT LOU
</b>ttt(yelling over the wind)
ttLet's go! Time to load up!

tYLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil. 

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttI'm missing two!

<b>ttttFAT LOU
</b>ttShit! Temp's dropping! We should have
ttleft this rock an hour ago!

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttt(eyes a device)
ttNorth three clicks.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MINI-VAN - DAY
</b>
tYLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky, 
tphysical; holds out a device and checks the reading.

tHe points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttThere!

tKICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic 
tmilitary garb -

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttYo, Teach, what the fuck?

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttWe're missing two of the kids!

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttGet your ass back to the shuttle.
ttI'll check it out.

tKICKER moves past the group and into the Van.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttNot without me!

tThe rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.

<b>tINT. ANCIENT CORRIDOR
</b>
tYLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls, 
tgraffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the 
tceiling states -

<b>tCRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY.
</b>
tThey all take off the goggles and masks. The rest of the group consists 
tof DELONGPRE(18) good looking, smart ass; JANESSA(17) sexual, scheming 
tAZRAEL(17) SMALL, COCKY; KKINSA(16), insecure, problematic; 
tTHORGAN(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttAmazing! But, how . . I've been coming
tthere for ten years. We never picked this up on
ttour . . . KAY-EM?

tKAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. She's 
tgorgeous, but there's something off about her look. Something synthetic.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttThe air's laced with type two ozone,
ttit reads as a solid.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttSomebody wanted the place to stay hidden.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttIn twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved
tttheir facilities underground to escape . . .

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttAll right, all right, enough with the history
ttlesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick
ttsome little punk ass.

tKkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.

<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttI have an idea, why don't you go find
ttthem and we'll get the hell out of here!

tKKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - -

tA CORPSE! Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled 
tthrough the forehead by an iron spike. 

<b>tKKINSA SCREAMS!
</b>
tKicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as 

tJANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams! 

tKAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttWas that out loud?

<b>ttttDELONGPREE
</b>ttThorgan, have you been screwing with . . .

tTHORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttCool! This is an automatic "A".

tAzrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some 
tcds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into 
this pack.
<b>ttttAZRAEL
</b>ttI've got my project. What are you losers
ttgonna do?

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttBack to the shuttle! All of you!
ttI'll find them.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttRelax, Soldier boy, this is amazing.
ttThese remains are two hundred years old.

tYllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. DANGER. STAY OUT.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttCreepy.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttCool.

<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttOkay, I'm outta here.

<b>ttttYYLO
</b>ttKay-Em, any thoughts?

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttGirth is better than length and
ttwomen prefer a shaved scrotum during
ttoral sex.

tYllo glares a Thorgan.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttI'm trying to give her some personality.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttWell stop messing with her. I don't want
tta science droid with a personality. Now
ttlet's find them and get back. I want to
ttget clearance to stay back and study this . . .

<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttNo way! I'm not staying here any longer . . .
ttI have a life you know.

tA radio crackles.

<b>ttttFAT LOU(V.O.)
</b>ttHey teach! This rock's starting to freeze!
ttGet your ass back hre!

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttt(into radio)
ttKeep your shirt on! I'm working on it.
ttYou won't believe what we found.
ttt(calls out)
ttAdrienne! Stoney!

tYllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass 
tanother hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE 
tFLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the 
tbeginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttThere was a hall of a battle down here.

tS they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING 
tVOICE sounds.

<b>ttttCOMPUTER VOICE
</b>ttDan-danger. Do not enter-er.

tBut the group keeps moving. 

<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttI feel compelled to ask why we are
ttignoring that.

tA corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a 
twarning written in ancient blood . . .

<b>tHELP ME . . .
</b>
tSuddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them, screaming like a banshee! 
tEveryone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get 
tthe corpse off her. 

tDELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. They hear 
thysterical laughter and look up to see -

tADRIENNE and STONEY . . . emerge from the shadows laughing 
tuncontrollably.

<b>ttttDELONGPREE
</b>ttDamnit!

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttWhat the hell are you two doing?!

tKkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.

<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttYou're toast, mister.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttYou're both toast!

<b>ttttADRIENNE
</b>ttYou gotta see this!

tThey turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of 
ta jumbled mess of jagged metal.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttt(re: ceiling)
ttThat's a strange design, don't you think?

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttWe don't have time for this shit.

tAs they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and 
tsqueeze together. That can't be a good thing . . .

tSTONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . . 
<b>tCRYOGENICS LAB.
</b>
tAdrienne points to a small window in the door.

<b>ttttDELONGPREE
</b>ttYeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.

<b>ttttADRIENNE
</b>ttCheck it out.

tWith a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in 
tthe door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -

<b>tA SKULL AND CROSSBONES 
</b>
<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttSo don't open the door.

<b>ttttADRIENNE
</b>ttLook beyond it, yesterday's news.

tYllo pushes his way to the window.

tShocked faces.

tINSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's 
tmassive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled 
tup into a ball, is a body - female, young.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttIs that?

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttThe room's still operational.
ttShe's perfectly preserved.

tYllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttt(into radio)
ttFat Lou, bring the ship to the
ttfollowing coordinates. Call Grendel,
tthave them power up the labs, we're bringing
ttin the find of the century!

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttNow wait a minute! I don't think you
ttshould open that door.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttThis is a science excursion corporal.
ttJust stay out of the way.

tYllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttOkay, no screwing around. This is the real
ttthing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, 
ttopen it up.

tThorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.

<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttYou're opening the door?
ttWhat about the . . . ?

tShe points to the skull and crossbones. 

<b>ttttDELONGPREE
</b>ttI'm thinking we should call in some
ttexperts.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttThis is your find people. You want to
ttgive your credit away?

<b>ttttDELONGPREE
</b>ttI was just saying . . .

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttThe cryo unit leaked. The computers
ttsealed the room. No airborne viruses
ttno hazardous materials. I've shut down the
ttuntil. Alright, stand back. 

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttHold your breath. Initial cryo gasses
ttwill render you unconcious.

<b>ttttDELONGPREE
</b>ttKnock you on your ass pal. 

tThey don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door 
tcracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes 
twith the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice 
tcrystals crack and fall to the floor.

<b>tEXT.  CRYO CELL
</b>
<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttKay-Em!

tKay moves into the room ahead of the others.

<b>tINT.  CRYO CELL
</b>
<b>tCLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES
</b>
tThey are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open 
tup. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the 
tbody.

t--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the 
twound in her shoulder, props the body up.

tThe other enter the icy chamber.

<b>ttttDELONGPREE
</b>ttI speak on behalf of the group
ttwhen I say . . . that's fucked.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttFemale, nineteen years old, eight months . . .
tt34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick
ttshit house.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttThorgan?!!!

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttSorry. I'll fix her when we get back.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttTime of hibernation 2049.
ttCrystallization at seventeen percent.
ttSuggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of
ttrejuvenation eight-one percent.

<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttWhat's going on?

<b>ttttDELONGPREE
</b>ttShe's dying.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttBitch looks dead to me.

tThe RADIO CRACKLES . . .

<b>ttttSERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
</b>ttYllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass
ttback to the shuttle!!

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttJanessa, stretcher.
ttt(into radio)
ttKeep your shirt on, sergeant. We have
tta medical emergency here not tot mention the
ttdiscovery of a lifetime.

<b>ttttSERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
</b>ttKicker! Get them the hell out of there!

tJanessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a 
tflat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground.

tKicker grabs Yllo.

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttWe're outta here!

tYllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of 
tblood and -CRACK-breaks it off.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttFine, grab that end.


tKicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled 
tbody on the stretcher.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tAs thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttHey check this out!

tProtruding from the door is the tip of a machete.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttThis caused the leak and there's an
ttoccupant. 

tThorgan yanks the door open.

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttDon't touch that!

tGas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.

<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttThis is bad, no?

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttRelax, it's only a  glitch in the
ttsystem. 

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttFirst field trip and you think
ttyou're a Scientist. Move out of the
ttway geek. 

tJANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. 

tAs the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a 
tjagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk 
tof ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES 
tlooms forward!

tJANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground 
tsending ice shrapnel everywhere!

<b>ttttDELONGPREE
</b>ttJesus, used to make the suckers big
ttdidn't they?

tAgain, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttSubject was dead prior to incubation.

tYllo moves to get a good look at Jason.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttMy God, look at him. Why would they freeze
tta dead body?
ttt(a beat)
ttAlright, load him up, and let's get out
ttof here!

<b>tOVER HIS SHOULDER - HALL
</b>
tA pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor.

<b>tBACK INSIDE 
</b>
tOne of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttEr, guy? I'm picking up some movement.

tFZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left 
tarm falls to the ground!

tKay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She 
tinjects him. The drugs take immediate effect.

<b>ttttAZRAEL
</b>ttCool . . . check out my arm.

<b>tCLINK - CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.
</b>
<b>tHALL
</b>
tThe metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our 
theroes. 

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttKicker!

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttDefense droids. I'm on it.

tKicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.


<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttThere goes prom night.

tKicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm.

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttThey're only class two. I can
tthandle this. No problem.

<b>ttttAZRAEL
</b>ttNot a problem?!

tKay-Em injects him again.

<b>ttttAZRAEL
</b>ttI'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr-
ttt(re:shot)
ttOh, that's dreamy.

tThe lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttOkay rent-a-cop, do your shit.
ttI gotta date tonight.

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttStand back!

tHe pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttWe have to get these two back in one piece!

tKay-Em turns to the frozen girl.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttSubject is critical. Needs nano stabilization
ttimmediately.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttKicker! Do something!

<b>ttttADRIENNE
</b>ttOh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that.

tAt her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically.

<b>ttttAZRAEL
</b>ttt(drugged up)
ttttThat is soooo cool!

tKicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.

<b>tKAFOOM!
</b>
<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttttCome on!

tKicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids 
tfollow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear 
taround the bend - towards the exit.

tA beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -

<b>tCLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.
</b>
tA dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! Some are old and rusty, other 
tslump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well.

<b>tINT.  LONG CORIDOOR
</b>
tKicker is running backwards, BLASTING with his weapon. Lasers FLASHING 
tall around our group. 


<b>ttttKKINSA
</b>ttHave I told you guys how much I hate this class?

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttWe need another exit! I'll hold 'em off!
ttTeach, find a way out!

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttI'm on it!

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttSorry kid, leave this to the pros.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttt(re: gadget)
ttLeft at the end of the hall!

tA laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttt(reading from device)
ttThey're not after us. Their sensors are
ttlocked in on . . . him!

tThorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER.

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttLeave him behind!

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttNo! He's coming with us!

tThey round a corner . . .

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttHere. We're one meter from the surface!

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttThen duck.

tCHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling.

tKABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above.

<b>ttttDELONGPREE
</b>ttIt's too high!

tKicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting!

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttMake it happen!

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttThey're just subclass B droids.
ttI'm so not impressed.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttStoney, you catch.

tStonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very 
tacrobatic move.

tBoeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his 
tfriends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall!

tSoon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttWe're clear! Let's go!

tBoeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. 
tHe spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker.

tKicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as 
tspider's cover the floor below them, then -

tA spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's 
tthigh. He screams.

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttThey've got me! Let go!

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttNo!

tBoeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the 
tspiders falling with the pack.

<b>tEXT. SURFACE - DAY
</b>
tThe sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttThat wasn't so bad.

tKicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.

<b>ttttKICKER
</b>ttt(yells)
ttThis will be!

tThe others dive for the ground as -  - 

tKAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttNice touch.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttAnd you said high school was boring.

tOur team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle.

tFAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.

<b>ttttFAT LOU
</b>ttOh my God . . . what the hell is . . .

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttJust get us to the ship!

tAzrael stops in a panic!

<b>ttttAZRAEL
</b>ttOh shit I forgot my arm!

<b>ttttADRIENNE
</b>ttHere. Dumbass.

tShe hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp.

tThe door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the 
tsky.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT.  ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE
</b>
tTHE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old 
tsatellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc.

<b>tINT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT
</b>
tNavigating through the debris, FAT LOU grabs a radio mike.

<b>ttttFAT LOU
</b>ttThis is Beowulf approaching from
ttsector fifteen.

tThrough the front windshield we see - - 

tGRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge 
ttorpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old.

<b>ttttBERNIE(V.O.)
</b>ttI've got you, Beowulf. Proceed with docking.
ttAnd by the way, Brodski's pissed.

<b>tINT.  DOCKING BAY
</b>
tThe shuttle doors open revealing SERGEANT BRODSKI and six E-X GRUNTS 
tstanding with weapons at the ready.

tAs the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two 
tstretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO.

<b>ttttBRODSKI
</b>ttWhat the hell were you thinking?

tYLLO ignores him, turns to his team.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttGet them in the lab!

<b>ttttBRODSKI
</b>ttNot so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

tThe E-X Grunts step in front of kids.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttt(to the grunts)
ttBack off!

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttt(back to the kids)
ttGet them to the labs . . . Now!

tThe team moves through the Grunts.

<b>ttttYLLO
</b>ttWhat the hell are you doing?

tBrodski looks down at the stretcher with the young woman's body on it.

</b>ttWhat the hell is this shit?

tDelongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself.

</b>ttHow did I get here, how did you bring me back?

</b>ttYeah?

tDelongpre comes through the door with a plate of food.

</b>ttI thought that after 400 hundred years,

tShe collapses onto the bed.

</b>ttI'll give you a moment alone. Do you

tRizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years.

tDelongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him.

tRizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket 
tof her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a

tHe's dressed in full military garb, a huge gun strapped to his hsoulder.

tSomething watching Azrael, his back to us. Azrael moves. The stalker
tcloses in.

tSuddenly Azrael hits, rolls and comes up Blasting right at us.

</b>
tA HUGE ALIEN CREATURE, fangs, claws and so on, leaps at him. THe big

tSitting on the floor, Azrael sighs and wipes his brow.

tSUddenly, another alien rises up behind him with a hideos Screech. 
tThere's nothing Azrael can do. He's a goner. Then --

</b>ttYou got lucky. I could have waited until he

<b>ttttAZRAEL
</b>ttSpeaking of which, duck!

tDallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it 
tlunge a half dozen more.  Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet,
ttake aim, when --

</b>
tGREEN GOO squirts from its body.

</b>ttWhat the?!

tThen another.

</b>ttHe's good.

tAzrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. 
tAliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in

tTHeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever.

<b>ttttDALLAS
</b>ttThat sucks. Why won't he go down?

<b>ttttAZRAEL
</b>ttPause play.

tSuddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to 
tDallas and Azrael.

<b>ttttDALLAS
</b>ttHe's not part of the program.

</b>ttHey cool. They brought ancient

tWhy aren't they running.

</b>ttHey! We're playing a game here.
ttGet off the court!

tJason raises his silver blade high.

<b>ttttDALLAS
</b>ttNo, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...

tSLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his 
trib cage. Blood spurts
tas his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, 
tonly pissed.

</b>ttAsshole that does not count as a kill.

<b>ttttDALLAS
</b>ttYes it does.

tThe head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks.

</b>ttOkay, enough of this shit.

</b>ttAlright, asshole.

tJason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white,

tNo creatures, no Dallas or Azrael. A both ends of the white garganuan

tDelongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan

</b>ttGo!

tRacing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping
tover and under and through whatever blocks the path.

</b>ttFaster!

tJason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE

tRIPS in half,dumping both

</b>ttHey, I think the fall killed him.

tanother Grunt body, removes a chain gun. THorgan takes a high
ttech laser from another.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttI feel better. Now how do you
ttfire this damn thing?

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttJust go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!

<b>ttttCRUTCH
</b>ttt(jokingly)
ttJust around this bend...

tJason steps out in front of Crutch, his machete held poised in front of 
thim.
tCrutch runs right up onto the blade.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttNooooo!

tAlrhoguh he's meat on a stick, Crutch doesn't give up. He SLAMS his 
tfists into
tJason's torso.

tThorgan turns to fire --Boeman KNOCKS the barrel high.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttYou'll hit crutch!

tBoeman tosses his weapon to Janessa and leaps on Jason's back, locking 
this arms 
taround his neck.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttWhat are you doing? You can't save him!

tDelongpre smashes the back of Jason's knee with the chaingun.
tJason topples on top of Boeman. Crutch is thrown free.

tJanessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the
tfirst time in 400 hundred years.

tIt's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. He leaps to his
tfeet and races towards her.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttDon't just stand there! Shoot him!

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttt(to Jason)
ttNo you don't!

<b>tBRAAAAAAATTTT!
</b>
tThe chaingun dances Jason backwards. He CRASHES through the side of one 
tof the 
tcargo boxes. EVERYONE STOPS.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttDon't stop!

tShe jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttYou never stop when he's down!

tBut the crate is empty.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttShit!!!!

tThey spin around, searching.

<b>ttttCRUTCH
</b>ttt(weak)
ttForget him. Come on.

tCarrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay.

</b>ttUh-oh.

</b>ttKkinsa! Open the doors!

</b>ttKkinsa! He's coming! Open the doors!

tDeLongpre shoves Boeman out of the way.

</b>ttt(calming)
ttKkinsa, it's me, Rizzo. He's not

tKkinsa doesn't move.

<b>ttttRIZZO(V.O.)
</b>ttKkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to

</b>

</b>ttMed-kit?

</b>ttI guessed.

tKkinsa considers. She reaches for a button marked SHUTTLE

<b>ttttRIZZO(V.O.)
</b>ttWe're going to be okay, Kkinsa.
ttJust relax.

</b>
tKay-Em 14 steps forward.

</b>ttAllow me. I'm trained in all aspects

tRizzo backs away -- as Kay-Em nears the mike ...

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttKkinsa, dear, it is I, KAY-EM 14...

</b>
tKkinsa leans forward and presses --

</b>
<b>tINT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY
</b>
tThe Shuttle ROARS to life and begins pulling away from the ship.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttKkinsa! No!!!

</b>
tThe shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position.

<b>tINT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY
</b>
tRizzo opens fire! Thorgan and Delongpre join in.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tAs boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire. Smoke rises. It's 
timpossible
tto see where Jason is. RIZZO stops FIRING.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b><b>ttDON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO!
</b>
tBut, they don't let up. Boxes explode, crates collapse until -- 
tThorgan's gun clicks empty.
tThen Delongpre's.

<b>tSILENCE.
</b>
tThe smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttDid we get him?

tSuddenly, Jason again steps into the Cargo entrance.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttWe're screwed!

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>tt400 years in the future and these
ttpea-shooters are the best you can do?!

tThey are trapped. Jason blocks the only exit. He slowly moves towards 
tthem.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttJust make a break for the door.
ttHe'll get some of us, but that's the
ttbreaks.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttWe're not leaving Crutch!

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttWe don't have time to argue!

tBut Jason has locked in on Rizzo. He moves towards her.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttOkay, tell you what. You die, we'll run.

tRizzo and the others back into a corner. Jason has them. There's nothing 
tthey
tcan do.

tRizzo holds the gun steady, waiting for point blank range.

<b>tEXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV
</b>
tThe left side of Grendel SMASHES into the side of Space Lab!

</b>
tSuddenly everything shifts toward the bridge. Boxes, cargo, kids, and 
tJason!

<b>tEXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV
</b>
tGrendel SLIDES along SPACE LAB, ripping huge chunks of metal from both.
tSPARK fly. There are interior EXPLOSIONS on Space Lab, then --

<b>tKA-FOOM!
</b>
tSpace Lab EXPLODES!

<b>tINT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY
</b>
tThe entire ship shifts upwards. Cargo, crew, and Jason fly into the air.

tELECTRICAL fires sprout up all over. Cargo boxes SHATTER, contents

</b>
tRIZZO loses her gun.

</b>
tOne huge chunk heads right towards the Shuttle.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttEveryone okay?

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttI think I broke my arm.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttI seem to have misplaced mine.

tKay-Em 14's right arm is missing, wires sticking out of the stump.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttYou geeks wanna gimmie a hand?

tJanessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble. Boeman helps her to her 
tfeet.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttt(quiet)
ttWe lost crutch.

tRizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body.
tIt's battered and twisted all out of place. Boeman falls next to the 
tbody.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttGoodbye old friend.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttOkay, he was a great guy, now
ttlet's move out.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttt(snaps)
ttCould you show a little compassion?!

tRizzo stares at Boeman.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttLook, I'm sorry. I really am, but aren't you
ttforgetting about ...

tSUDDENLY a pile of rubble EXPLODES.

tJason rises, his back to them.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttBack to the labs!

tBut Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he 
trushes after them.

<b>tINT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE
</b>
<b>ttttCOMPUTER VOICE
</b>ttDam-damage port side 59 percent.
ttDecompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors
ttfailing.

<b>tINT.  CARGO BAY
</b>
tOur kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them --

tThorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly.
tThe door won't open.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttOh shit.

tThey turn as Jason looms toward them, then --

<b>tEVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT
</b>
tCargo and debris. Our heroes. Jason.

tThe loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum SLAMS him into 
tthe 
tcargo doors, BREAKING them open and sending him tumbling backwards.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttThis is just great.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttEngage magnetics.

tKay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tJason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the 
tback of the head.

tStill holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of 
tframe.

tThe force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttThis is crazy, we can't do anything like this!

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tRizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the 
tceiling.

<b>tA SEVERED ARM
</b>
tfloats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand.
tDelongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason.

<b>tBRAAATTTT...
</b>
tJason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun SLAMS 
tDelongpre into a back wall.
tHe's knocked unconcious.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tAs Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttGrab my hand!

tJanessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious 
tdELONGPRE'S FOOT.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttBoeman, can you reach DeLongpre?
ttWe'll push you in.

<b>tCARGO - MIDSHIP
</b>
tJason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay,
tunable to stop himself.

<b>tBOEMAN
</b>
treaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the 
tlocks of his
thair, pulls himself closer.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttHey! That hurts.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tRizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a 
thanging piece of
tbusted catwalk.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttt(to Rizzo)
ttPush off toward us.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttForget her, she's a pain in the ass.
ttLet her hang there.

tCrutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his 
topen gut,
ttangling around our heroes.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttI'm gonna spew.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttThat ought'a help the situation.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttDo it Rizzo! We'll catch you.

<b>tRIZZO'S POV
</b>
tRizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, 
tBoeman, and Delongpre.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttWhat if you miss?

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttWhat if we don't?

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tAS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then 
tpushes off with his feet.

tHE ROCKETS toward her!

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttHe's coming right at you!

tRizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED...
tand bad. She's gonna miss them.

tBoeman flips in the air!

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttt(to Delongpre)
ttGrab my feet!

tDelongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum 
tspins the human
tchain into a near wall --KAFWAM-- nearly breaking it apart.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttOkay that hurt.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttThorgan, pull us in.

tJason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall --

tAs Thorgan pulls the group out of the Cargo bay.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttWhat now?

tThey watch as Jason grabs a hold of the walkway.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttShit. He's gonna send himself right at us.

tJason takes aim.

</b>ttSystem repair activated. Back up power on line.

<b>tINT.  CARGO BAY
</b>
tJason again ROCKETS THROUGH THE AIR -- when

<b>tGRAVITY IS RESTORED.
</b>
tHe drops to the cargo floor like a rock! Falling cargo -- huge crates, 
tgargantuan machines,
ta forklift -- buries him.

tOur heroes tumble to the ground.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttt(to Rizzo)
ttGet off of me!

tThey stand slowly, eyeing the rubble.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttt(rubbing his arm)
ttYou think it killed . . .
ttt(off Rizzo's stare)
ttYeah, I guess not.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttLet's just get out of here.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttThe ship's in bad shape. Back to
ttthe labs. Let's check out status.

<b>tINT. SHIP CORRIDORS
</b>
tOur group makes their way back toward the labs.

tELECTRICAL fires are everywhere. Systems are shorting out all over the 
tship.

<b>tINT. LAB ONE
</b>
tRizzo, in the lead, enters the lab, when the ship BUCKS and QUAKES! A 
tportion of the hall
tcollapses behind her.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR
</b>
tBoeman and the others dive back out of the way.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttShit!

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttThe hull's imploding!

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttRizzo! Can you hear me?!

<b>tINT.  LAB ONE
</b>
<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttYeah. Are you guys okay?

tBoeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttThere's a red lever on the wall
ttbeside you. Pull it!

tRizzo turns, spots the red lever. EMERGENCY PRESSURIZATION STABILIZER.
tIt's bolted.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttIt's locked!

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttThen break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's
ttgoing to depressurize!

tRizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table. BASHES the bolt with it, until 
tit breaks.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttHurry Rizzo! You have to reverse
ttthe pressurization.

tShe grabs the lever...then hesitates. Backs away.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttWhat are you doing?!!

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttIf the ship goes, so does Jaso.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttRizzo pull the fucking lever!

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttRizzo?!

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttIt's better this way. If we were rescued
ttJason would just get off the ship. You want
tthim on your precious Earth II?

<b>tINT.  CORRIDOR
</b>
tBoeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way!

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttHurry! She's lost it!

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttSo what else is new?

<b>tINT.  LAB ONE
</b>
tBoeman climbs through a hole in the rubble. He grabs the lever.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttBoeman don't. You know I'm right.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttAre you crazy?! Pull the lever!

tBoeman yanks the lever.

tAs the others climb into the lab --

<b>ttttCOMPUTER VOICE
</b>ttDepressurization inconclusive.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttWe've lost too much pressure. An hour, tops.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttt(to Rizzo)
ttYou happy? You've killed us all!

tThorgan rushes over to the big Nano-tech machine. Places his broken arm 
ton the slab.
tThe machine quickly goes to work.

tA schematic of his arm appears on the wall.

tJanessa stares at him.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttWhat's the point?

tDelongpre shrugs.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttSo that's it then.

tIt seems it is.

tJanessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their 
trelationship
twent beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from 
tthe ship's
thull.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttTHat's the sound of deep space attacking the
ttintegrity of the ship.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttNo...
ttt(signing)
ttThat's the sound of the men working
tton the chain gang.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttAre there any other shuttles?

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttTeleportation? Some way to beam us the
tthell out of dodge?

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttYou read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttA little late to be thinking about
ttescape, isn't it?

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttI'll never experience my fantasy of
ttthree sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod.
ttDamn.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttAm I in there?

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttSory...

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttHey.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttThat's a good fantasy, though.
ttKinky, but good.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttHey!!

tAll heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The 
tleft hull
tof the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the 
tvarious 
tsystem failures. Rizzo points to the right hull.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttWhat's this?

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttIt's the engine, reactors, audiometers,
ttit's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.

tRizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttCan we get through these?

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttSure but what good will that do?

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttWhen the left hull goes, so will the
ttright.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttWhat if we blow the walkways first?
ttLeave Jason over here to go up with
ttthe ship?

tThey stare at her.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttYou know, Yllo seemed to think we could
ttcatch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth
ttmillions.

tThe others stare at her as if she were crazy.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttAny connection between your reality and mine
ttis purely coincidental.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttI'm just saying.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttt(to others)
ttCome on. You got all these gadgets and shit.
ttWhy can't we get inside the right hull, seal up
ttthe doors and blow the walkways?

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttWe'd need charges.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttWe could convert fission transistors.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttWe're not supposed to do that.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttWhat are you gonna do, tell me?

<b>ttDELONGPRE
</b>ttThe engine room will have molecular welders.
ttWe could seal up the hull.

tA moment of consideration. Could this actually work?

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttYeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big
ttguy distracted with a blow job.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttWould you?

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttNow this is getting exciting.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttRemember to roll his balls around a bit.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttYou got a better plan?

tObviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices 
tfrom under
ta cabinet.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttI'll need system four converters.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttThey're back here.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttHow many?

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttBring 'em all. Let's move!

tThorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttHey! I'm not ready.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttThen you better hurry. I'll blow alley
ttone, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there.
ttJanessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttYou're so bossy.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttYou're leaving me here alone?

tDelongpre tosses the chaingun next to him.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttDon't blow your foot off.

tThey climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttIt's just you and me, then.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttCome here, might as well fix that arm.

<b>tINT.  CARGO BAY
</b>
tBoeman, Janessa, Delongpre, and Rizzo slowly move through the piles of

tStill burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttSee anything?

tThey move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before.

tCLOSE on the rubble.

tThere is an obvious hole dug out from the middle.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttI think I speak on behalf of the group
ttwhen I say this is bad news.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttt(into headset)
ttThorgan? You coming?!

</b>
tThorgan is fooling around in the back of Kay-Em 14's head. The nano-tech

ttAlmost done.

</b>ttOw!

</b>ttOh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.

</b>ttSometimes I just wish I had a kitten.

tBoeman enters, throws his pack to the ground and goes to work ttaching a

</b>
tJanessa enters and goes through the same motions.

<b>tINT. WALKWAY THREE
</b>
tDelongpre and Rizzo attach a device to the wall.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttPut your finger here.

tSHe does so. Delongpre connects several wires. Rizzo looks nervous. 
tDelongpre notices.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttMy father wanted me to be a businessman.

tSilence.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttThat's why I'm here.

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttSo, you thought you'd be cool. Go against
ttyour father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.

tDelongpre looks at her like she's crazy.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE
</b>ttMy father's company imports and exports. Archaeology 
ttis part of the business. We happen to get along just

</b>ttYou thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh?
ttYou must have been a very lonely girl.

tSilence. Neither speaks.

tKA-THUMP -- There's anoise in the Cargo Bay.

tShe covers the mike on her headset and calls out.

<b>ttttJANESSA
</b>ttThorgan, you little shit, is that you?

tNo answer. She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of 
ttranquillizer
tand a monster syring.e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive 
tdosage. Enough to
tbring down a Rhino...or Jason maybe?

tShe starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay.
tSurely she's not that stupid.

tRizzo is staring at Delongpre as he works on another device.
tThen --

<b>ttttRIZZO
</b>ttWhen I was four, the ocean quit producing

ttthe occasional terrorist bombing...the

tShe stands frozen in fear.

</b>ttWe don't have a choice!

tBoeman slams the door panel. The door slowly rises.

twith anticipation...he would. He raises his Machete --

tThen stops. Lowers it.

<b>tCHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG.

tTHORGAN marches down the walkway with KAY-EM 14. The new and imporved

</b>
tWhere her severed arm had once been, a chain gun is now attached. A

tShe kicks him down the long corridor.

tKay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room. He crashes into the glass

</b>ttIf we don't sever the hull completely

</b>ttThen what do we do?!

</b>ttI don't know!

tKay-Em stands over Jason. And for the first time in ten films Jason is

tBut still climbs to his feet...slowly.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttWhy you low life, scum sucking,
ttrat dick blowing, sum bitch.
ttYour mamma must'a had some huge balls.

tOf course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother.

tJason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14! They roll into another glass case. 
tGlass, formaldehyde and specimens

tEveryone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame.
tHe's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his

ttThat was very good. You should

</b>ttHurry up people! We're running out

tThe machine HUMS to life. BUZZING and BEEPING. Suddenly a laser scans

tJason is leaned up against the Nano-Tech machine.

tHoses and wires now encircle Jason's body. We follow one of the hoses 
tuntil it ends
tover --

<b>tA WASTE BEND
</b>
tnside we see pile of bullets. Stuff falls from the hose. Bullets from 
tthe chaingun,
tbullets from  every previous Jason movie. A broken machete blade drops 
tto the pile.
tThe tip of an arrow. A couple of knives. A pair of pliers. An ink pen. 
tThe skeleton
tof a fish.

tThe scanning lasers move to the stump at Jason's shoulder. We see the

tOn the schematic, we see Jason's internal organs being repaired.

tBy now  we've figured out ...nothing good can come of this.

tSuddenly there is a GRINDING SOUND. Engines WHINE from behind them.

tThe cargo door is starting to smoke. It SQUEALS as it slowly opens.

</b>ttWell fuck me.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttNo, fuck me.

tThe door opens and Jason steps into the walkway.

tBut he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now

tKay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as
tbullets vounce off of his metal limbs.

tJason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor, 
tremoving a hunk of metal.

tJason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS.
tOne of the wires, connecting two charges severs.

<b>ttttBOEMAN
</b>ttShit!

tKay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved 
tbackwards.

tBoeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues.

tIT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic 
tkiller.
tSPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but 
tJason uses 
this machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee.

tShe stumbles...falls to the ground.

<b>ttttTHORGAN
</b>ttKay-Em!!!

tBoeman splices the wires together.

tBut Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman.

</b>
tAs her body separates from her legs mid-thigh. CHCHHHHH!

tAs Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in --

tKA-FWAM! Kay-Em slams into him! Knocking Boeman free.

tJason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again.

tCHANG! CLANG! CLUNK! Metal against metal. Kay-Em hovers up the walls,

tTurns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end.

tAs he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to

</b>
tForest, cabins, the lake. Everything as we and Jason remember.
tBut somehow distroted. A strange hue covers everything.

tNo, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are
tstrange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something

tThe cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a

tBut the image will do.

tThorgan grabs the portable keyboard and starts typing away!

</b>
tJason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange Conan in space.
tThe image flickers...he  catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo

tThen a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him.

tHe's clicking away like a mad man.

</b>
tA ROCK BAND appears playing some futuristic metal. Then CHEERLEADERS in 
tscantily clad outfits. Then a MIDGIT in a cowboy hat riding by on a 
ttricycle. We have now entered Thorgan's twisted streams of conciousness.

tJason tears through the aboe. His goal now clear. The distractions no
tlonger fool him.

tA volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around.
tA fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo. A huge turtle.
tA couple of goats.

tNothing is stopping Jason.

tJason starts pounding from the other side.

<b>ttttDELONGPRE(V.O.)
</b>ttDon't worry. He can't get through that door.

tDelongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some

tTurns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at --

<b>tTHE DOOR PANEL
</b>
tHe preses the button

tthe ari lock door begins to open. Air is suddenly sucked out of the

tSergeant Brodski's body flies out into space. Everything not tied down

tHe's
tgoing to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her 
thead,
twhen --

tDelongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms

tRIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear

tThe three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II.

tThen, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button 
ton her sleeve.

tSuddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them.  The four survivors huddle 
ttogether.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttHello? A little assistance here?

tThey turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by. Thorgan graps at her 
tand pulls
ther head into his arms.

<b>tTHE GROUP CHEERS.
</b>
<b>ttttTHORGAN(V.O.)
</b>ttKay-em you okay?

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttI am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

<b>ttttTHORGAN(V.O.)
</b>ttI missed you too.

<b>ttttKAY-EM 14
</b>ttI love you.

tThose two aren't the only two.

<b>tCLOSE ON RIZZO AND DELONGPRE
</b>
tTheir glass face masks are touching. They stare into each other's 
teyes.

<b>ttttRIZZO(V.O.)
</b>ttChinese, huh?

tThey laugh and turn to stare toward EARTH II.

<b>tEXT.  EARTH II -- ORBIT
</b>
tSuddenly Jason's body comes into view. It's racing toward Earth II.
tBrodski riding it like Slim Pickens.

<b>ttttBRODSKI
</b>ttYeee---Haaaaa!!

tSlowly they begin entering the atmosphere.

tImmediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good
tman...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.

tSpread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his
tdescent.

tHis fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up.
tIt begins to glow. His metallic arm and leg glow.

tFlames build as he rockets towards Earth II.

tFlesh BUBBLES and OOZES.

tHis legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his 
tbody!

<b>tEXT.  CAMP SIGHT
</b>
tFour kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion 
tcampfire.

<b>ttttKID # 1
</b>ttHey! Check that out!

tThey look up and see a blaze shooting towards Earth II.

<b>ttttKID # 2
</b>ttA falling star!

<b>ttttKID # 3
</b>ttIt's a meteor dickhead.

<b>ttttKID # 2
</b>ttIt's still cool.

tIt LIGHTS up the night, then --

<b>tEXPLODES IN A BRILLIANT FIREWORKS DISPLAY!
</b>
<b>ttttKID # 1
</b>ttCool!!!

tFrom the explosion, one small smoldering chunk falls toward Earth II.

<b>tEXT.  CRYSTAL RESERVOIR
</b>
<b>tOUR POV
</b>
tAs the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing chrome
thockey mask!

tIT HITS THE WATER with a SSSSS!!!!

<b>tBACK TO KIDS
</b>
<b>ttttKID # 4
</b>ttDamn! It his the reservoir.

<b>ttttKID # 1
</b>ttLet's go check it out!

tThe others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward what
tcould be a wonderful new discovery.

</b>
tThe hockey mask washes down the stream, comes to a halt at a pair of
tgrusomely charred hands.

tTWITCH, curl around the mask, lifting it off camera. AND WE --
