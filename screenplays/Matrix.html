</b>
tSo close it has no boundaries.

tA blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a
theart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath
tthe derma of black-neon glass.

tA PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were 
tmaking the call.  The cursor continues to throb,
trelentlessly patient, until --

</b>tttHello?

tData now slashes across the screen, information flashing
tfaster than we read.

<b>tttttWOMAN (V.O.)
</b>tttI'm inside.  Anything to report?

tWe listen to the phone conversation as though we were on
ta third line.  The man's name is CYPHER.  The woman, 
<b>tTRINITY.
</b>
<b>tttttCYPHER (V.O.)
</b>tttLet's see.  Target left work at
<b>ttt5:01 PM.
</b>
<b>tttttSCREEN
</b>tttTrace program:  running.

tThe entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers.
tShimmering like green-electric rivets, they rush at a 10-
tdigit phone number in the top corner.

<b>tttttCYPHER (V.O.)
</b>tttHe caught the northbound Howard 
tttline. Got off at Sheridan.  
tttStopped at 7-11.  Purchased six-
tttpack of beer and a box of Captain 
tttCrunch.  Returned home.

tThe area code is identified.  The first three numbers
tsuddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

tWe begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each 
tdigit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like
tthe wheels of a slot machine.

<b>tttttTRINITY (V.O.)
</b>tttAll right, you're relieved.  Use
tttthe usual exit.

<b>tttttCYPHER (V.O.)
</b>tttDo you know when we're going to
tttmake contact?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttSoon.

tOnly two thin digits left.

<b>tttttCYPHER (V.O.)
</b>tttJust between you and me, you don't 
tttbelieve it, do you?  You don't 
tttbelieve this guy is the one?

<b>tttttTRINITY (V.O.)
</b>tttI think Morpheus believes he is.

<b>tttttCYPHER (V.O.)
</b>tttI know.  But what about you?

<b>tttttTRINITY (V.O.)
</b>tttI think Morpheus knows things that
tttI don't.

<b>tttttCYPHER (V.O.)
</b>tttYeah, but if he's wrong --

tThe final number pops into place --

<b>tttttTRINITY (V.O.)
</b>tttDid you hear that?

<b>tttttCYPHER (V.O.)
</b>tttHear what?

</b>tttAre you sure this line is clean?

<b>tttttCYPHER (V.O.)
</b>tttYeah, course I'm sure.

tWe MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green 
tnumbers GROWING INTO an OMINOUS ROAR.

<b>tttttTRINITY (V.O.)
</b>tttI better go.

<b>tttttCYPHER (V.O.) 
</b>tttYeah.  Right.  See you on the other side.

tShe hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the
tnetherworld of the computer screen.

tWhere gradually the sound of a police radio grows around 
tus.

<b>tttttRADIO (V.O.)
</b>tttAttention all units.  Attention
tttall units.

tSuddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
tourselves in --


<b>tINT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
tThe hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way 
tacross the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms 
tas it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving 
tpatterns of permanent shadow.

tWe FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as 
tthey creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves
ton either side of room 303.

tThe biggest of them violently kicks in the door --

tThe other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before
tthem.

<b>tttttBIG COP
</b>tttPolice!  Freeze!

tThe room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a fold-
tup table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook 
tcomputer.  The only light in the room is the glow of the
tcomputer.

tSitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is 
tTRINITY; a woman in black leather.

<b>tttttBIG COP
</b>tttGet your hands behind your head!

tTrinity rises.

<b>tttttBIG COP
</b>tttHands behind your head!  Now!  Do
tttit!

tShe slowly puts her hands behind her head.


<b>tEXT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
tA black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the 
tpolice cruisers.

tAGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car.

tThey wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  They 
tare also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones 
tin one ear, its cord coiling back into their shirt
tcollars.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttLieutenant?

<b>tttttLIEUTENANT
</b>tttOh shit.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH 
</b>tttLieutenant, you were given 
tttspecific orders --

<b>tttttLIEUTENANT
</b>tttI'm just doing my job.  You gimme 
tttthat Juris-my dick-tion and you 
tttcan cran it up your ass.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttThe orders were for your protection.

tThe Lieutenant laughs.

<b>tttttLIEUTENANT
</b>tttI think we can handle one little
tttgirl.

tAgent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
thotel.

<b>tttttLIEUTENANT
</b>tttI sent two units.  They're 
tttbringing her down now.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttNo, Lieutenant, your men are dead.


<b>tINT.  CHASE HOTEL
</b>
tThe Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding 
ta bead.  They've done this a hundred times, they know 
tthey've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuff 
tand Trinity moves --

tIt almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly 
tfast.

tThe eye blinks and Trinity's palm. snaps up and the nose 
texplodes, blood erupting.  The cop is dead before he
tbegins to fall.

tAnd Trinity is moving again --

tSeizing a wrist, misdirecting a gun, as a startled cop 
<b>tFIRES --
</b>
tA head explodes.

tIn blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed 
tblack hole --

tAnd FIRES --

tTrinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she 
treverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.

tThe cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his 
twindpipe, killing the scream as he falls to the ground.

tShe looks at the four bodies.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttShit.


<b>tEXT.  CHASE HOTEL
</b>
tAgent Brown enters the hotel, while Agent Smith heads for 
tthe alley.


<b>tINT.  CHASE HOTEL
</b>
tTrinity is on the phone, pacing.  The other end is 
tanswered.

<b>tttttMAN (V.O.)
</b>tttOperator.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttMorpheus!  The link was traced!  I
tttdon't know how.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttI know.  Stay calm.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttAre there any agents?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttYes.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttGoddamnit!

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttYou have to focus.  There is a 
tttphone.  Wells and Laxe.  You can
tttmake it.

tShe takes a deep breath, centering herself.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttAll right --

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttGo.

tShe drops the phone.


<b>tINT.  HALL
</b>
tShe bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall,
tleading another unit of police.  Trinity races to the 
topposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the 
tfire escape.


<b>tEXT.  FIRE E5CAPE
</b>
tIn the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at 
ther.  She can only go up.


<b>tEXT.  ROOF
</b>
tOn the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over 
tthe parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.

tTrinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her 
tmoverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,
tcontrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.

tAgent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.

tThe METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity 
tturns to it, racing for the back of the building.

tThe edge falls away into a wide back alley.  The next 
tbuilding is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is 
tperfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other 
troof.

tThe cops slow, realizing they are about to see something 
tugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself 
tinto the air.

tFrom above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she 
thangs in flight

tThen hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.

<b>tttttCOP
</b>tttMotherfucker -- that's impossible!

tThey stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the 
tmove exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto 
tone knee.

tJust below the building are the runbling tracks of 
triveted steel.  The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a 
trattling blur of gray metal.  Trinity junps, landing
teasily.

tShe looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air 
tbarely reaching the last car

tAgent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.

tTrinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.

tAhead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point 
twhere the train has begun to turn, there is --

tA window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick
tbuilding.

tTrinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her 
tspeed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL 
trises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the
tturn.

tTrinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body 
tleveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head
tas --

tThe whole world seems to spin on its axis --

tAnd she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then 
tfalls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down
tstairs bleeding, broken --

tBut still alive.

tThrough the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,
tstill on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the
twind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train 
tslides him past the window.

tTrinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttGet up, Trinity.  You're fine.
tttGet up -- just get up!

tShe stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.


<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>
tTrinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the 
tend of the block, in a pool of white street light, she
tsees it.

tThe telephone booth.

tObviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,
tfocusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE
tbegins to RING.

tAcross the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its 
tTIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.

tTrinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the
ttelephone booth as if taking aim.

tGritting through the pain, she races the truck --

tSlamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly
tbright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

tShe answers the phone.

tThere is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking 
tmass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --

tBarreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick
twall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp.

tAfter a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of 
tthe garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.
tThere is no body.  Trinity is gone.

tHis jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.
tAGENT JONES walks up behind him.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttDid you get anything from the
tttroom?

<b>tttttAGENT JONES
</b>tttTheir next target.  The name is
tttNeo.

tThe handset of the pay phone lays on the ground,
tseparated in the crash like a severed limb.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttWe'll need a search running.

<b>tttttAGENT JONES
</b>tttIt's already begun.

tWe are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER 
tand CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out 
tlike a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall
tthrough one --

tSwallowed by the darkness that becomes --

tA computer screen.

tWe are on-line, inside a chat room called "The Matrix." 
tIt is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.

<b>tttttSCREEN
</b>tttJACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been
ttton this board.
tttSUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even
tttexist and the Matrix is nothing 
tttbut an advertising gimmick 4 a new
tttgame.
tttTIMAXE:  All I want to know is
tttTrinity really a girl?
tttLODIII:  87% of all women on line
tttare really men.
tttQUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism 
tttfor the government.
tttSUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the
tttsystem controlling our lives.
tttTIMAXE:  You mean MTV.
tttSUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega.
<b>tttFOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!!
</b>
tWe drift back from the electric conversation entering --


<b>tINT.  NEO'S APARTMENT
</b>
tIt is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with
ttechnology.

tWeed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into
tthickets that wind up and around the legs of several
tdesks.

tTabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay
topen like an autopsied corpse.

tWe turn towards the center of this rat-nest of
ttechnology, following the slurping and crunching of
tcereal.  We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --

tNEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a 
tcomputer than living outside one.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttFuckin' idiots don't know shit.

tHe finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an 
tanonynous message slices onto the screen.

<b>tttttSCREEN
</b>tttDo you want to know what the
tttMatrix is, Neo?

tNeo is frozen when he reads his name.

<b>tttttSCREEN
</b>tttSUPERASTIC:  Who said that?
tttJACKON:  Who's Neo?
tttGIBSON:  This is a private board.

tttIf you want to know, follow the
tttwhite rabbit.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat the hell...

<b>tttttSCREEN
</b>tttTIMAXE:  Someone is hacking the
ttthackers!
tttFOS4:  It's Morpheus!!!!!
tttJACKON:  Identify yourself.

tttKnock, knock, Neo.

tA chill runs down his spine and when someone KNOCKS on
this door he almost jumps out of his chair.

tHe looks at the door, then back at the computer but the
tmessage is gone.

tHe shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
tAgain, someone knocks.

tCautiously, Neo approaches the door.

<b>tttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>tttHey, Tommy-boy!  You in there?

tRecognizing the voice, he relaxes and opens it.  ANTHONY,
twho lives down the hall, is standing outside with a group
tof friends.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat do you want, Anthony?

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttI need your help, man.  Desperate.
tttThey got me, man.  The shackles of 
tttfascism.

tHe holds up the red notice that accompanies the Denver
tboot.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttYou got the money this time?

tHe holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door.
tAnthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo.

<b>tttttDUJOUR
</b>tttYou can really get that thing off,
tttright now?

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttI told you, honey, he may look 
tttlike just another geek but this 
ttthere is all we got left standing 
tttbetween Big Brother and the New
tttWorld Order.


<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>
tA police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the
twheel of an enormous oldsmobile.


<b>tINT.  NEO'S APARTMENT
</b>
tThey watch from the window as the cops, silently,
trobotically, climb into their van.

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttLook at 'em.  Automatons.  Don't 
tttthink about what they're- doing or
tttwhy.  Computer tells 'em what to
tttdo and they do it.

tttwith us?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttI don't know.  I have to work
ttttomorrow.

<b>tttttDUJOUR
</b>tttCome on.  It'll be fun.

tHe looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
tleather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  bands,
tsymbols, slogans, military medals and --

tA small white rabbit.

tThe ROOM TILTS.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttYeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.


<b>tINT.  APARTMENT
</b>
tAn older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a 
tchain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy
tcasements.

tSmoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there 
tare.

tDressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,
tgathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like
tjungle cats around a tree.

tNeo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle
tof beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to
tleave when he notices a woman staring at him.

tThe woman is Trinity.  She walks straight up to him.

tIn the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
teach other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttHello, Neo.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttHow did you know that --

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttI know a lot about you.  I've been
tttwanting to meet you for some time.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWho are you?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttMy name is Trinity.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttTrinity?  The Trinity?  The
tttTrinity that cracked the I.R.S.
tttKansas City D-Base?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttThat was a long time ago.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttGee-zus.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttWhat?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttI just thought... you were a guy.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttMost guys do.

tNeo is a little embarrassed.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttDo you want to go sorewhere and
ttttalk?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttNo.  It's safe here and I don't
ttthave much time.

tThe MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking
tdirectly into each other's ear.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttThat was you on the board tonight.
tttThat was your note, wasn't it?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttI had to gamble that you would see
tttand they wouldn't.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWho wouldn't?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttI can't explain everything to you.
tttI'm sure that it's all going to
tttseem very strange, but I brought
tttyou here to warn you, Neo.  You
tttare in a lot of danger.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat?  Why?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttThey're watching you.  Something
ttthappened and they found out about
tttyou.  Normally, if our target is
tttexposed we let it go.  But this
ttttime, we can't do that.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttI don't understand --

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttYou came here because you wanted
tttto know the answer to a hacker's
tttquestion.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttThe Matrix.  What is the Matrix?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttTwelve years ago I met a man, a
tttgreat man, who said that no one
tttcould be told the answer to that
tttquestion.  That they had to see
tttit, to believe it.

tHer body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttHe told me that no one should look
tttfor the answer unless they have to
tttbecause once you see it,
ttteverything changes.  Your life and
tttthe world you live in will never
tttbe the same.  It's as if you wake
tttup one morning and the sky is
tttfalling.

tThere is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels
tthe words like a drug, seeping into him.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttThe truth is out there, Neo.  It's
tttlooking for you and it will find
tttyou, if you want it to.

tShe takes hold of him with her eyes.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttThat's all I can tell you right
tttnow.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good
tttluck.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWait.  Who was it?  Who was the
tttman?

tShe leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she
twhispers.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttYou know who.

tShe turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
tof bodies.

tA SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music,
tpressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>tINT.  NEO'S APARTMENT
</b>
tThe sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to

<b>tEXT.  SKYSCRAPER

tThe downtown office of CorTechs, a software development

<b>tINT.  CORTECHS OFFICE
</b>
tThe main offices are along each wall, the windows
toverlooking downtown Chicago.

tRHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo
twithout looking at him, typing at his computer
tcontinuously.

tNeo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
toutside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the
tsurface of the glass.

<b>tttttRHINEHEART
</b>tttYou have a problem, Mr. Anderson.
tttYou think that you're special.
tttYou believe that somehow the rules
tttdo not apply to you.

tHe stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in
ttime.

<b>tttttRHINEHEART
</b>tttObviously, you are mistaken.

tHis long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.

<b>tttttRHINEHEART
</b>tttThis company is one of the top
tttsoftware companies in the world
tttbecause every single employee
tttunderstands that they are a part

tHe turns again.

<b>tttttRHINEHEART
</b>tttThe time has come to make a

tttI make myself clear?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttYes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly
tttclear.

<b>tINT.  NEO'S CUBICLE
</b>
tThe entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a
tlabyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
televators.

tNeo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands
tup in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.

<b>tttttTALL EMPLOYEE
</b>tttWhat did he say?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttIf I was late again, I'm going to
tttbe fired.

tHe smirks.

</b>tttWell, it was nice working with

tNeo glares at him, as he sinks down.

<b>tttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>tttThomas Anderson?

tNeo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttYeah.  That's me.

tNeo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him
tthe softpak.

<b>tttttFEDEX
</b>tttHave a nice day.

tHe opens the bag.  Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE.  It seems
tthe instant it is in his hand, it RINGS.  Unnerved, he
tflips it open.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttHello?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttHello, Neo.  This is Morpheus.

tNeo's knees give and he falls into his chair.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)

</b>tttYes.  Now.

tNeo starts to stand.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttDo it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator.

tHis head slowly peeks up over the partition.

tAt the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones
tleading a group of cops.  A female employee turns and
tpoints out Neo's cubicle.

tNeo ducks.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttHoly fuckin' shit!

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttYes.

tOne cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the
tagents.

</b>tttWhat the fuck do they want with

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttI'm not sure.  But, if you don't

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttHow?!

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttI can guide you out, but you have

tThe agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttThe cubicle across from you is
tttempty.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttBut what if...?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttGo!  Now!

tNeo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle
tjust as the agents turn into his row.

tNeo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone
ttightly to him.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttStay here for a moment.

tThe agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to
tsearch the bathroom.

tMorpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttA little longer...

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttWhen I tell you, go to the end of

tSweat trickles down his forehead.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttNow.

tNeo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he
tfreezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.

tStaying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING
tacross the opening to the first office on the left.

tThe room is empty.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttGood.  Now there is a window.
tttOpen it.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttHow do you know all this?

tMorpheus laughs quietly.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttThe answer is coming, Neo.

tHe opens the window.  The window howls into the room.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttOutside, there's a scaffold.  You
tttcan use it to get to the roof.

tLeaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is
tseveral offices away.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttNo! It's too far away.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttThere's a small ledge.  It's a

tNeo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a
tconcrete chasm.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttNo way, no way, this is crazy.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS (V.O.)
</b>tttDon't be controlled by your fear,

tthe scaffold.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttThis is insane!  Why is this
ttthappening to me?  What did I do?
tttI'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.
tttFuck! Fuck!  Fuck!

tHe climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the
tframe, he steps onto the small ledge.

tThe scaffold seems even farther away.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttI'm going to die.

tThe WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,
tknocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to
tthe frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.

tHe watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttThis is insane.  I can't do this!

tHe climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the

<b>tEXT.  SKYSCRAPER
</b>
tThe agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving

tTrinity watches in the rear view mirror of her

<b>tINT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR
</b>
tA wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at
ta table alone.

tWe MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the

tAt the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.

tSmith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila envelope
tslaps down on the table between them.

tNeo glances at the name on the file: "Anderson, Thomas 
<b>tA."
</b>
<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttAs you can see, we've had our eye

tHe opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he
tflips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at
tthe file or at him.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttIt seems that you have been living
ttttwo lives.  In one life, you are

tNeo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.

</b>tttOne of these,lives has a future.

tHe closes the file.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttI'm going to be as forthcoming as

tHe removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice-

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttWe know that you have been

tHe leans closer.

</b>tttMy colleagues believe that I am

tAgent Smith smiles.

</b>tttAnd tell me, Mr. Anderson, what
tttgood is a phone call iy you are
tttunable to speak?

tThe question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to
tfeel the muscles in his jaw tighten.

tThe standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion
tgrow into panic.

tNeo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
tseal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his
tmouth is gone.

tWild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents
trestrain him holding him in the chair.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttYou are going to help us, Mr.

tSmith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.

tFrom a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a
tlong, fiber-optic wire tap.

tNeo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over
this exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the
telectronic device animates, become an organic creature
tthat resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.

tThin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into
tNeo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature
twhich looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --

tBefore it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it
tworms its way inside.


<b>tINT.  NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tScreaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.

tHe realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth
tis normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a
tdeep, everything-is-okay breath, when --

tThe PHONE RINGS.

tIt almost stops his heart.  It CONTINUES RINGING,
tbuilding pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed,
tsucking him in with an almost gravitational force.

tHe answers it, saying nothing.

</b>tttI don't know what you are thinking

</b>
tAn EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.


<b>tINT.  TRAIN
</b>
tIt is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban
tnight crawlers.  Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching
teverything nervously.

tThere is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as
tthe door is opened.

tNeo turns and sees a large man enter.  He is wearing
tsunglasses and a black leather jacket.  His name is APOC
tand he walks straight at Neo.

<b>tttttAPOC
</b>tttCome with me.

tNeo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and
ttwo police officers rush in, drawing their guns.

tApoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit.  There
tis no upcoming station.

tApoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles
tagainst its own speed.  The cops are thrown back.  Neo
tslams against the metal rail.

tThe doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his
tbalance, Apoc shoves him backwards --

tHe flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls
tfrom, the raised tracks --

tHurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere,
ta truck races under him and --

tHe crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty
tboxes.


<b>tINT.  TRUCK BED
</b>
tStill shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone.  A
tman named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him.  Trinity is
tnext to him, talking into a cellular phone.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttWe got him.  Call the chop-shop.

tShe hangs up.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttListen to me, Neo.  You have to,

tShe tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches
tfor his face.

</b>tttWhat are you doing?

</b>tttThis has to be done for your

tShe seals his eyes shut with the tape.

<b>tEXT.  LOWER WACKER
</b>
tA featureless black van glides up to a staircase that
tcurls down from the city's surface.

ttrinity guides the blind Neo down the steps.  The back of
tthe van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who
tlooks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is
ta cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.

tHis name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,
texposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking
tbraces.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttVa va va voom.  Still the hottest
tttsoftware around.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttHello, Gizmo.

tNeo hears the voices around him.

</b>tttThis is really the guy?  The guy
tttthat Morpheus thinks --

</b>tttAre you going to help us or aren't

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttHacksaw.  Load up the copper-top
tttand let's get the hell outta here.

tHacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron.  He
tshoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.

tA moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve
tover the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the
tunderworld.


<b>tINT.  VAN
</b>
tThe chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to
tmeters and monitors.  There are shelves lined with
tmedical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives,
tcleavers, and stainless steel clamps.

tNeo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening
tnervously as Gizmo gets to work.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttOkay, first we take a little look
tttunder the hood.

tHe pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they
tblink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising
tto varying levels of magnification.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttYou're going to feel a little
tttprick.

tHe inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower
tabdomen.  The needles are wired to video monitors.
tHacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat are you doing?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttWe think you're bugged.  We can't
ttttake you to Morpheus until you're
tttclean.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttThere it is.

tOn a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large
tintestines.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttHit him with 10 ccs of local.

tHacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic
taround Neols navel.

tUsing a device that looks like a miniature speculum,
tGizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick.  Typing into a
tcalculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the
ttip.

tOn the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end
tseparate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttHere, kitty, kitty, kitty.

tThe claw snags hold of the bug.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttGotcha!

tBut the bug reacts violently.  Neo screams as it wraps
titself around the soft tissue web of intestine.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttShit.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttWhat's happening?

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttI don't know.  They've never done

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttIt'll work.  Come on, do it or
tttHacksaw will.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttDo what?

tThe instant he hears the word, he knows.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttClear.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttOh, shit --

tThe cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his
tchest.  Gizmo wrestles with the bug.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttHit him again!

tAgain, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo
tyanks the speculum out.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttGot it!

tTrinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe.
tShe eases the tape off his eyes.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttNeo, are you okay?

tHe nods.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttIt's over.  We got it.

tHanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire-

</b>tttNasty little bugger, ain't it?


<b>tINT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

tThe van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten
thotel.  The doors open and Trinity helps Neo get out.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttThanks for your help, Gizmo.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttI just hope the man knows what

tTrinity turns around.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttGizmo, you don't have the hardware

tHe howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away.
tTrinity turns to Neo.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttLet's go.  He's waiting.


<b>tINT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE
</b>
tIt is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttThis is it.

tNeo can hear his own heart pounding.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttLet me give one piece of advice.
tttBe honest.  He knows more than you
tttcan possibly imagine.


<b>tINT.  ROOM 1313
</b>
tAcross the room, a dark figure stares out the tall
twindows veiled with decaying lace.  He turns and his
tsmile lights up the room.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttAt last.

tHe wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
tbehind circular mirrored glasses.

tHe strides to Neo and they shake hands.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWelcome, Neo.  As you no doubt
ttthave guessed, I am Morpheus.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttIt's an honor.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttPlease.  Come.  Sit.

tHe nods to Trinity.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThank you, Trinity.

tShe bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an
tadjacent room.

tThey sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-
tleather chairs.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttI imagine, right now, you must be
tttfeeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
tttdown the rabbit hole?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttYou could say that.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttI can see it in your eyes.  You
ttthave the look of a man who accepts
tttwhat he sees because he is
tttexpecting to wake up.

tA smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttIronically, this is not far from
tttthe truth.  But I'm getting ahead
tttof myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,
tttwhy are you here?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttYou're Morpheus, you're a legend.
tttMost hackers would die to meet

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttYes.  Thank you.  But I think we

tttthat.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttNo.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWhy not?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttBecause I don't like the idea that
tttI'm not in control of my life.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttI know exactly what you mean.

tAgain, that smile that could cut glass.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttLet me tell you why you are here.
tttYou are here because you have the
tttgift.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat gift?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttI've watched you, Neo.  You do not
tttuse a computer like a tool.  You
tttuse it like it was part of
tttyourself.  What you can do inside
ttta computer is not normal.  I know.
tttI've seen it.  What you do is
tttmagic.

tNeo shrugs.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttIt's not magic.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttBut it is, Neo.  It is.  How else
tttwould you describe what has been
ttthappening to you?

tHe leans forward.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWe are trained in this world to
tttaccept only what is rational and
tttlogical.  Have you ever wondered
tttwhy?

tNeo shakes his head.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttAs children, we do not separate
tttthe possible from the impossible
tttwhich is why the younger a mind is
tttthe easier it is to free while a
tttmind like yours can be very
tttdifficult.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttFree from what?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttFrom the Matrix.

tNeo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of
thimself.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttDo you want to know what it is,
tttNeo?

tNeo swallows and nods his head.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttIt's that feeling you have had all
tttyour life.  That feeling that
tttsomething was wrong with the
tttworld.  You don't know what it is
tttbut it's there, like a splinter in
tttyour mind, driving you mad,
tttdriving you to me.  But what is
tttit?

tThe LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThe Matrix is everywhere, it's all
tttaround us, here even in this room.
tttYou can see it out your window, or
ttton your television.  You feel it
tttwhen you go to work, or go to
tttchurch or pay your taxes.  It is
tttthe world that has been pulled
tttover your eyes to blind you from
tttthe truth.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat truth?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThat you are a slave, Neo.  That
tttyou, like everyone else, was born
tttinto bondage...
ttt... kept inside a prison that you
tttcannot smell, taste, or touch.  A
tttprison for your mind.

tOutside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttUnfortunately, no one can be told
tttwhat the Matrix is.  You have to
tttsee it for yourself.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttHow?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttHold out your hands.

tIn Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThis is your last chance.  After
tttthis, there is no going back.

tIn his left, a blue pill.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttYou take the blue pill and the
tttstory ends.  You wake in your bed
tttand you believe whatever you want
tttto believe.

tThe pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttYou take the red pill and you stay
tttin Wonderland and I show you how
tttdeep the rabbit-hole goes.

tNeo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the
tmoisture growing in his palms.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttRemember that all I am offering is
tttthe truth.  Nothing more.

tNeo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The
tCheshire smile returns.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttFollow me.

tHe leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with
thigh-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green
tfrom the racks of monitors.

tTrinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttShit.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttI knew he would.

tCypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone
taway from, Neo.

<b>tttttCYPHER

tttnot to let fear control your life.
tttApoc, are we on-line?

tNeo recognizes the large man from the El train.

<b>tttttAPOC
</b>tttAlmost.

tHe and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttApoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen
tttVirus.

<b>tttttAPOC
</b>tttThat's right.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttNeo, time is always against us.
tttWill you take a seat there?

tIn the center of the room sits a chair.  Near the chair
tis an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttI imagine you know sonething about
tttvirtual reality.

tNeo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode
tdisks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttA little.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttTell me about it.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttEssentially, it's a hardware
tttsystem that uses an apparatus;
tttheadgear, gloves and whatever to
tttmake you feel that you are in a
tttcomputer program.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttIf the virtual reality apparatus,
tttas you called it, was wired to all
tttof your senses and controlled them
tttcompletely, would you be able to
ttttell the difference between the
tttvirtual world and the real world?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttYou might not, no.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttNo, you wouldn't.

tNeo whispers to Trinity.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttYou did all this?

tShe nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.
tThey are wired to an old hotel phone.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThe pill you took is part of a
ttttrace program.  It's going to make
tttthings feel a bit strange.

tDistantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING
ton a KEYBOARD.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and
ttwitch when he notices the mirror.

tWide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a
twebwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
tmirror were becoming liquid.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttShit...

tCypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent
tdata.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.

tNeo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers
tdisappear beneath the rippling surface.

tQuickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
tstretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy
tstuck to his fingertips.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat is this?  Mescaline?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttJust relax, Neo.

tThe strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,
tuntil the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.

tWith the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes
tof electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and
tfade.

tHe looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored
ticicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running
tlike wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms
twhere he sees his face reflected.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttUh-oh...

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttIt's going into replication.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttApoc?

<b>tttttAPOC
</b>tttStill nothing.

tMorpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttTank, we're going to need the
tttsignal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.

tThe mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up
this arns like hundreds of insects.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttIt's cold.

tThe mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,
ttipping his head as though he were sinking into the
tmirror, trying to keep his mouth up.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttIt's all over me --

tMorpheus is right next to him, with the phone.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttI got a fibrillation!

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttI knew it, I knew it...

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttShit!  Apoc?

tStreams of mercury run from Neo's nose.

<b>tttttAPOC
</b>tttTargeting... almost there.

tAn ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.

<b>tttttTRINITY

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttHe's gonna pop!

<b>tttttAPOC
</b>tttLock!  I got him!

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttNow, Tank now!

tHis eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a
thigh-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --

tIt is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to
tanother computer --

tNeo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were
tpulled into the holes of the phone

tSucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.


<b>tINT.  POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN'S BODY
</b>
tFloating in a womb-red amnion.

tHis body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.

tMetal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure
this face.  Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs
tand cover his genitals.

tHe is struggling desperately now.  Air bubbles into the
tJell-O but does not break the surface.

tPressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red
trubber coccon.

tUnable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at
tthe thinning elastic shroud --

tUntil it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he
tsucks for air.  Tearing himself free, he emerges from the
tcell.

tIt is Neo.

tHe is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.
tDizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.

tHe is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled
twith red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified
tlike curdled milk.

tThe IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear
tto be grafted to his flesh.

tHe feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the
tback of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial
tplugged and locked into the base of his skull.

tHe tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull
toff a finger.

tTo either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with
tred gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and
tmotionless, he sees other human beings.

tFanning out in a circle, there are more.  All connected
tto a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing
tpetal attached to a black metal stem.

tAbove him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly
tforever.  He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks
tout.

tThe image assaults his mind.

tTowers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible
theights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an
tunderwater abyss.

tHis sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the
tintensity of the vision.  The sound of the PLANT is like
tthe sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of
tLeviathan.

tBelow Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away
tthe body of an old man like an automated barge even as a
tnew pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space.

tInside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and
tpinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby.

tFrom above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.

tHe swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.

tIt is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful
thousings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems
tof hard and soft polymers.

tA black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain
tas the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired
tto the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex.

tAt the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens,
tdisengaging.

tThe cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle
tand cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull
twith an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.  The other
tconnective hoses snap free and snake away as --

tThe back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like
tan airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo
tinto a black hole.


<b>tINT.  WASTE LINE
</b>
tThe pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls,
tsliding with the clot of gelatin.

tBanking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up
tthrough grease traps clogged with cily clunps of
tcellulite.

tNeo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the
tflow of waste.

tThe metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the
tbelly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside
tthe sewer main line.


<b>tINT.  HOVERCRAFT
</b>
tThe metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo
tonto the floor.

tHuman hands and arms help him up as he finds himself
tlooking straight at Morpheus.

tTrinity and Apoc.  And others, dressed in bizarre, high-
ttech combat gear.

tMorpheus smiles.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWelcome to the real world, Neo.

tNeo passes out.

<b>tFADE IN:

</b>
<b>tttttNEO

tHe opens his eyes again, something tingling through him.
tHe focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of
tacupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.

<b>tttttDOZER
</b>tttHe needs a lot of work.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttI know.

tDozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat are you doing?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttYour muscles have atrophied.
tttWe're rebuilding them.

tFluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhy do my eyes hurt?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttYou've never used them before.

tMorpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo.
tNeo lays back.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttRest, Neo.  The answers are
tttcoming.


<b>tINT.  NEO'S ROOM
</b>
tNeo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better.  He is
twearing a black tank top and shorts.

tHe begins to examine himself.  There is a futuristic IV
tplugged into the jack in his forearm.  He pulls it out,
tstaring at the grafted outlet.

tHe feels his bald head.  His fingers find and explore the
tlarge outlet in the base of his skull.

tJust as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the
tdoor.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttMorpheus, what's happened to me?

</b>tttMore important than what is when?

</b>tttYou believe the year is 1997 when
tttin fact it is much closer to 2197.
tttI can't say for certain what year

tThe wind is knocked from Neo's chest.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttThat's not possible.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttI promised you the truth, Neo, and
tttthe truth is that the world you
tttwere living in was a lie.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttHow?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttI'll show you.


<b>tINT.  HOVERCRAFT
</b>
tLike a sleepwalker, Neo follows Morpheus through the ship.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThis is my ship, the
tttNebuchadnezzar.  It's a
ttthovercraft.  Small like a
tttsubmarine.  It's dark.  It's
tttcramped and cold.  But it's home.

tThey climb a ladder up to the main deck.


<b>tINT.  MAIN DECK
</b>
tEveryone is there.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThis is the main deck.  You know
tttmost of my crew.

tTrinity smiles and nods.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThe ones you don't know.  That's
tttMouse and Switch.  The two big
tttguys are Tank and Dozer.

tThe names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttAnd this, this is the Core.  This
tttis where we broadcast our pirate
tttsignal and hack into the Matrix.

tIt is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines of
tcoaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic
tbattery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks
tof little systems and computer monitors.

tAt the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton
tchairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.

tNear the circle of chairs is the control console and
toperator's station where the network is monitored.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttHelp him, Trinity.

tNeo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttDo you remember when I asked you
tttabout an apparatus that could turn
ttta virtual reality into reality?

tNeo nods.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttIt's right here.

tHe touches Neo's head.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttAnd it's accessed here.

tNeo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack
tat the back of his neck.  The cable has the same kind of
tcerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThis will feel a little weird.

tThere are several disturbing NOISES as he works the
tneedle in.

tWe MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens
tinto a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop
tlike when you equalize them underwater.

tHe relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling
tof weightlessness inside another place --


<b>tINT.  CONSTRUCT
</b>
tNeo is standing in an empty, blank-white space.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThis is the Construct.

tStartled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the
troom with him.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttIt is our loading program.  We can
tttload anything from clothes, to
tttweapons, to training simulations.
tttAnything we need.

tMorpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the
ttwo leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a
tlarge-screen television.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttSit down.

tNeo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttRight now, we're inside a computer
tttprogram?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWild, isn't it?

tNeo's hands run over the cracked leather.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttThis isn't real?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWhat is real?  How do you define
tttreal?  If you're talking about
tttyour senses, what you feel, taste,
tttsmell, or see, then all you're
ttttalking about are electrical
tttsignals interpreted by your brain.

tHe picks up a remote control and clicks ON the
tTELEVISION.  We drift through the Windy City circa 1996.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThis is the Chicago you know.
tttChicago as it was at the end of
tttthe twentieth century.  This
tttChicago exists only as part of a
tttneural-interactive simulation that
tttwe call the Matrix.

tWe GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttYou have been living inside
tttBaulliaurd's vision, inside the
tttmap, not the territory.  This is
tttChicago as it exists today.

tThe sky is an endless sea of black and green bile.  The
tearth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out
tbeneath us as we ENTER the television.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>ttt'The desert of the real.'

tIn the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago
tprotruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of
ta long-dead corpse.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWe are, right now, miles below the
tttearth's surface.  The only place
ttthumans can survive outside the
tttMatrix is underground.

tStill MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the
tchairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert.
tDizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat happened?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttIt started early in the twenty-
tttfirst century, with the birth of
tttartificial intelligence, a
tttsingular consciousness that
tttspawned an entire race of
tttmachines.

tIn his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttAt first all they wanted was to be
ttttreated as equals, entitled to the
tttsame human inalienable rights.
tttWhatever they were given, it was
tttnot enough.

tIn the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light
tup a bloody battle field.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWe don't know who struck first.
tttUs or them.  But sometime at the
tttend of the twenty-first century
tttthe battle was joined.

tWe MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThe war raged for generations and
tttturned the face of our planet from
tttgreen and blue to black and red.

tAt last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are
tat once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic
tarchitecture like a microbiotic organism, that is
tperpetually in motion.

tThe Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier,
tsplitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttIt scorched and burned the sky.
tttWithout the sun, the machines
tttsought out a new energy source to
tttsurvive.

tThe Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink
tbursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud
tof stain.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThey discovered a new form of
tttfusion.  All that was required to
tttinitiate the reaction was a small
tttelectric charge.  Throughout human
ttthistory we have been dependent on
tttmachines to survive.  Fate, it
tttseems, is not without a sense of
tttirony.

tWe return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where
twe see human beings looking almost blissful in their
tgelatin cocoons.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThe human body generates more bio-
tttelectricity than a 120-volt
tttbattery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s
tttof body heat.

tOutside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a
tbreathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWe are, as an energy source,
ttteasily renewable and completely
tttrecyclable, the dead liquified and
tttfed intravenously to the living.

tHuge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttAll they needed to control this
tttnew battery was something to
tttoccupy our mind.

tWe see inside a clear tubular husk.  Floating in viscous
tfluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already
tgrowing around the brain-jack.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttAnd so they built a prison out of
tttour past, wired it to our brains
tttand turned us into slaves.

tWe PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television
tand we are again inside the white space of the Construct.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttNo!  I don't believe it!  It's not
tttpossible!

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttI didn't say that it would be

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttDon't touch me!  Get away from me!

tNeo isn't sure of that answer.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS

tttThere is a rule that we do not

tMorpheus walks in.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttHow is he?

tTank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.

<b>tttttTANK
</b>tttTen hours straight.  He's a
tttmachine.

tNeo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath
thissing from his lips.  He looks like he just orgasmed.

tHe locks at Morpheus.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttThis is incredible.  I know Kung
tttFu.

tMorpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin.  He nods to
tTank.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttShow me.


<b>tINT.  DOJO
</b>
tThey are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThis is a sparring program,
tttsimilar to the programmed reality
tttof the Matrix.  Consider this your
tttfirst lesson.

tHe assumes a fighting stance.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttAttack me.

tNeo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until
the gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.

tIt is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and
tfeet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack
<b>t--
</b>
tBut each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.


<b>tINT.  MAIN DECK
</b>
tWhile their minds battle in the programmed reality, the
ttwo bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive
tchairs.

tTank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is
twildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and
tsteady rhythm of Morpheus.


<b>tINT.  MESS HALL
</b>
tDinner is up.  Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell
tprotein.  It has a cottage cheese consistency.

tMOUSE bursts in the room.

<b>tttttMOUSE
</b>tttMorpheus is fighting Neo!

tAll at once they bolt for the door.


<b>tINT.  DOJO
</b>
tNeo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls
thimself at Morpheus.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttGood.  Adaption.  Improvisation.
tttBut your weakness isn't your
ttttechnique.

tMorpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.
tHis feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart.  For
tevery blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --

tNeo falls.

tPanting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his
tmouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttHow did I beat you?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttYou -- You're too fast.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttDo you think my being faster,
tttstronger has anything to do with
tttmy muscles in this place?

tNeo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttDo you believe that's air you are
tttbreathing now?

tNeo squints at him.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttIf you can free your mind, the
tttbody will follow.

tNeo stands, nodding.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttAgain.

tTheir fists fly with  pneumatic speed.


<b>tINT.  MAIN DECK
</b>
tEveryone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,
tlike watching a game of Mortal Combat.

<b>tttttCABLE
</b>tttJeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast!

<b>tttttMOUSE
</b>tttYou ever seen anyone that fast
tttthat soon, Tank?

<b>tttttTANK
</b>tttNever.

</b>tttMorpheus is right.  He's got to be
tttthe one.


<b>tINT.  DOJO
</b>
tThe speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems
timpossible to sustain.  Neo's face sheds its mask of calm
twith a scream.

tHe wants to beat Morpheus bad.

tFinally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the
thead, knocking his glasses off.


<b>tINT.  MAIN DECK
</b>
tThere are several gasps.

<b>tttttMOUSE
</b>tttI don't believe it!

tMorpheus rubs his face.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttYou are angry with me.

tNeo pants.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttI, uh... maybe.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttIt's all right.  It's natural.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttI feel better.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttGood, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo,
tttbut it's a heavy one.

tMorpheus smiles.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttTank, load the jump program.

tNeo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain
tlifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building
trooftop in a city skyline.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttYou have to learn to let go of
tttthat anger.  You must let go of
ttteverything.

tA WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttYou must empty yourself to free
tttyour mind.

tMorpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop.
tAnd jumps.  He sails through the air, his coat billowing
tout behind him like a cape --

tSomersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the
tstreet.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttShit.

tNeo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at
tMorpheus an impossible fifty feet away.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttOkie dokie.

tHe takes a deep breath.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttYeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No

tHe concentrates.  Runs.

tTrinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she
twhispers.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttCome on.


<b>tEXT.  ROOFTOP
</b>
tSummoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo
tlaunches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek
<b>t--
</b>
tBut comes up drastically short.

tHis eyes widen as he plummets.  Stories fly by, the
tground rushing up at him, but as he hits --

tThe ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net.

tHe bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on
this back.

tHe laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from
this face.

tMorpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttEveryone falls the first time.

tNeo nods quietly.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttIf you never know failure, how can
tttyou know success?


<b>tINT.  MAIN DECK
</b>
tThey break up.

<b>tttttMOUSE
</b>tttWhat does it mean?

<b>tttttCABLE
</b>tttIt doesn't mean anything.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttEveryone falls, right, Trinity?

tBut Trinity has left.

tNeo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to
tmove and groans, cradling his ribs.

tWhile Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttI thought it wasn't real.

tNeo stares at the blood.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttIf you are killed in the Matrix,
tttyou die here?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThe body cannot live without the
tttmind.


<b>tINT.  NEO'S ROOM
</b>
tTrinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttNeo, I saved you some dinner --

tShe sees him passed out on the bed.  She sets the tray
tdown and pulls the blanket over him.

tShe pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly,
tbreathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.

tIt seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a
tstart, unsure of where he is.  After a moment, he gets
tout of bed.


<b>tINT.  HALL
</b>
tThe ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep.


<b>tINT.  MAIN DECK
</b>
tThe core glows with monitor light.  Cypher is in the
toperator's chair as Neo cones up behind him.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttWhoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the
tttbejeezus out of ne.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttSorry.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttNo, it's all right.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat are you doing?

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttMidnight watch.

tNeo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens
tthat seem alive with a constant flow of data.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttIs that... ?

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttThe Matrix?  Yeah.

tThe monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttYou want a drink?

tHe pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttI'll tell you, I feel for you,
tttman.  I really do.  Most of us
tttwere still young, just punks, when
tttMorpheus jacked us.  But you, you
ttthad a real life.

tNeo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds
ton his back.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttGood shit, huh?  Dozer makes it.
tttIt's good for two things:
tttdegreasing engines and killing
tttbrain cells.

tRed-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttDid he tell you why he did it?

tNeo nods.

<b>tttttCYPHER,
</b>tttI'll be the didn't tell you that
tttthis wasn't the first time he
tttthought he found the One.

tNeo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttLet me give you a piece of advice.
tttBetween you and me, if Morpheus
tttsays you can fly, I wouldn't go
tttjumping out any windows to find
tttout if he's right.  Understand?

tCypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat-
tscorching mouthful.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttWelcome to the real world!


<b>tINT.  RESTAURANT (MATRIX) - NIGHT
</b>
tCHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as
twe watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous
tsteak.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttThat's what he said to me nine
tttyears ago.

tThe meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing
tred juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttThe real world.  Ha, what a joke.

tWe recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttYou know what real is?  I'll tell
tttyou what real is.

tA fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the
tface of Cypher.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttReal is just another four-letter
tttword.

tHe laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.

tThe restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago
tskyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu
thas no prices.

tSitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttDo we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

tCypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his
tteeth.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttMmm, so, so fucking good.

tSmith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his
tmouth.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttYou know, I know that this steak
tttdoesn't exist.  I know when I put
tttit in my mouth, the Matrix is
ttttelling my brain that it is juicy
tttand delicious.  After nine years,
tttdo you know what I've realized?

tPausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork.  He
tpops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef
tmelting in his mouth.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttIgnorance is bliss.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttThen we have a deal?

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttI don't want to remember nothing.
tttNothing!  You understand?  And I
tttwant to be rich.  Someone
tttimportant.  Like an actor.  You
tttcan do that, right?

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttWhatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

tCypher takes a deep drink of wine.

<b>tttttCYPHER
</b>tttAll right.  You get my body back
tttin a power plant, reinsert me into
tttthe Matrix and I'll get you what
tttyou want.

<b>tttttAGENT SMITH
</b>tttAccess codes to Zion.

tSweat dapples his lip as Neo snaps out of the construct
tcoma.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttJeez, I was wondering about that.

<b>tttttTANK
</b>tttWhat?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhy I was bald here but not in the
tttMatrix.

<b>tttttTANK
</b><b>tttR.S.I.
</b>

</b>tttGood.  Now what's this?

tHe points to one of Neo's monitors.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttLife systems monitor, glucose
tttlevels.

<b>tttttTANK
</b>tttWhat's that?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttMain power supply to the core.

tHe follows Tank to the operator's station where he points
tto a red key-switch.

<b>tttttTANK
</b>tttHow about this?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttMainframe self-destruct.  Uses all
tttremaining power to generate an...
<b>tttE.M.P?
</b>
<b>tttttTANK
</b>tttElectromagnetic pulse.  Our best
tttweapon against the machines.  The
tttproblem is if someone is still in
tttthe Matrix when that thing goes
tttoff, they're not coming back.

tNeo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttHow's he doing?

<b>tttttTANK
</b>tttWe just finished the operation
tttprograms and he's showing great
tttretention.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttGood.  I want everyone alerted to
ttt12-hour stand-by.  We're going in.
tttNeo, it's time for you to know why

tMorpheus walks away.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat's he talking about?

<b>tttttTANK
</b>tttHe's taking you into the Matrix to
tttsee her.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttSee who?

</b>tttThe Oracle.

tNeo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data
tthat seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as

tAn El train.


<b>tINT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
</b>
tThe room is empty, heavy curtains covering windows.  It
tlooks as if it hasn't been touched in years.  In the
tbedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black PHONE
tbegins to RING.

tIn the mirror, we first glimpse them and as we keep
tTURNING, the room fills with equipment and the team.

tMorpheus answers the phone.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWe're in.

tHe hangs up.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttMouse and Cable hold the exit.
tttLet's go.


<b>tINT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY
</b>
tNeo follows the others down the stairwell that winds
taround an antique elevator shaft.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttDid you have to do this?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttYeah.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat did she tell you?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttLots of things.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttAny of them true?

tTrinity looks at him, then looks away.

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttSome of them.

<b>tttttGIZMO
</b>tttWere they good or bad?

<b>tttttTRINITY
</b>tttThere's no point in worrylng.

tdoors.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttWe should be back in an hour.


<b>tEXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY
</b>
tNeo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright.
tHe is the only one without sunglasses.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttDo you now understand what it
tttmeans when we say, if you're not
tttone of us, you're one of them?

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttThe agents.  They're sentient
tttprograms.  They can commandeer any
tttsoftware hardwired to the
tttmainframe.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttAnyone that is still in a power

tttinvisible in the Matrix.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttThe best hacking is always
ttttraceless.

tCypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the
tperimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he
tsurreptitiously drops something inside.

tIt is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as
tthe LINE CONNECTS.

tAn early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a
tcorrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in.


<b>tINT.  LINCOLN CONTINENTAL (MATRIX) - DAY

tAn enormous man is waiting for them.  A wad of chewing
ttobacco bulges his cheek.  He spits into a Coke can.

<b>tttttMOJO
</b>tttMorpheus, been a long time coming.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttYou're looking well, Mojo.

tMojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his
tchin and shirt.  He stares at Neo.

<b>tttttMOJO
</b>tttYou bringing us geriatrics now.
tttMorpheus?

tHe spits and laughs again.

<b>tttttMOJO
</b>tttGuess you are locking for a

<b>tEXT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY
</b>
tThe Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of
tneighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes.


<b>tINT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY
</b>
tA lightless, lower-class bar.  No one enters that is not
texpected.

tThe front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as
tMojo leads Morpheus and Neo inside.  Neo looks around,
this eyes adjusting to the darkness.

tMojo talks to the bartender, then looks over.

<b>tttttMOJO
</b>tttAll right, it's cool.  Go on back.

tThey weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY
tFLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET.

tA monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up.

<b>tttttREX
</b>tttYou're late.

tHe moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind

tsingle bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only
tdoor.


<b>tINT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

tA high-tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of

taccess codes.  After a moment the screen blinks, "Welcome
tMorpheus."

tMorpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it
tnow leads into --


<b>tINT.  TEMPLE OF ZION (MATRIX) - DAY
</b>
tThe walls and floors are polished marble.  Neo follows,
this mouth agape.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat -- what happened?

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttThis is the temple.  It is a part
tttof Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden
tttinside the Matrix so that we can
tttaccess it.

tTwo PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber.

<b>tttttPRIESTESS
</b>tttHello, Morpheus.  We've been
tttexpecting you.

<b>tttttMORPHEUS
</b>tttOkay, you're on your own.  Go with

</b>tttWait here.  Among the other
tttPotentials.


<b>tINT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY
</b>
tNeo enters and finally understands the attention given to
this age.  The Potentials are all little children.

tThe room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
tkindergarten class.  The children's heads are either
tshaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing,
tothers meditating or practicing their gift.

tNeo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
tblocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
tblade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.

tNeo crosses to him, sits.

tThe Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
timitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
tit bend.

<b>tttttSPOON BOY
</b>tttYour spoon does not bend because
tttit is just that, a spoon.  Mine 
tttbends because there is no spoon,
tttjust my mind.

tNeo watches as it curls into a knot.

<b>tttttSPOON BOY
</b>tttLink yourself to the spoon.
tttBecome the spoon and bend
tttyourself.

tNeo nods, again holding up his spoon.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttThere is no spoon.  Right.

tHe concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the
tPriestess touches his shoulder.

<b>tttttPRIESTESS
</b>tttThe Oracle will see you now.

tSpoon Boy smiles.


<b>tINT.  SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY

tzodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
ta three-legged throne.

tThe throne is empty.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttHello?

tA DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
tthe stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something
tcooking.

tFollowing the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
tfinds an open door.

<b>tttttVOICE (O.S.)

tIt looks like a suburban tract house.

tThere is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch
tfilled with china, shelves and tables crowded with
tdoilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.

tNeo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen.

tA WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside
tthrough the cracked door.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttWhat vase?

tHe turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from
tthe table.  It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.

<b>tttttORACLE
</b>tttThe vase.

<b>tttttNEO
</b>tttShit, I'm sorry.

tShe pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns.
tShe is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts,
tcomfortable slacks and a print blouse.  She looks like
tsomeone's grandma.

<b>tttttORACLE
</b>tttI said don't worry about it.  I'll

</b>tttYou know what that means?  It's

</b>tttWell, let's have a look at you.

tShe widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the

tAnd when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing
twith fire.

tThe Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's

tMorpheus strains at his handcuffs.

tThe Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD,

tMorpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the

tThe rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord
tattached to a machine.

tAs their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other
ton a seemingly magnetic course until --

tThey collide.

tAlmost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs,
tscrambling, hands searching in furious desperation,
tfinding hold and clinging.

tUntil the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their

tfalling down --

tAs Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed
twrist.
