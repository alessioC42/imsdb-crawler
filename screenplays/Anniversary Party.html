</head>
<pre>


<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tTIGHT CLOSE - JOE THERRIAN - MORNING
</b>
tHe's in his mid-thirties, his face relaxed in sleep,
tchildlike.  Nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife.

<b>tTHE CAMERA STAYS CLOSE.  SLIGHTLY BLURRED, SOFT, SLOWLY
</b><b>tSWINGS ROUND
</b>
<b>tTIGHT CLOSE - SALLY THERRIAN
</b>
tShe's in her mid-thirties, with large deep eyes.  She watches
ther husband unguarded in sleep.  Her pretty face, alert,
tshe's barely breathing.  Traces the just visible lines around
this eyes, and mouth.  Brushes fingertips against his
teyelashes.

<b>tTIGHT CLOSE - SALLY'S HAND PULLS THE BEDROOM SHADE.
</b>
tIt retracts with a loud WHACK, sun, sky, trees.

<b>tttSTEVEN (O.S.)
</b>ttAnd breath...and chataronga...

<b>tEXT. POOL AREA - DAY
</b>
tWe're in the middle of a yoga lesson.  Joe and Sally stand on
ttheir mats.  Steven, their instructor, wanders around the
tcouple issuing soft-spoken instructions.

tA large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge
tfireplace.  The dining room on one side, living room on the
tother.  Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch
tgarden pool... The house is classic Neutra.  All GLASS and
<b>tSMOOTH LINES.
</b>
tThe calm is broken by the telephone.  Joe and Sally ignore it
tuntil the answering machine picks up.  They break their yoga
tposes and listen.

tThe CAMERA hovers over the answering machine.

<b>tttLUCY (O.S.)
</b>ttt(over answering machine; sweet,
ttt British, slightly desperate)
ttJoe, it's Lucy.  Remember me?  It's the
ttblack sheep here.  Bah...not funny.
ttHaven't heard from you, need you, call
ttme.  Love you madly.  Hi, Sally.  Joe,
ttI'd love to talk to you before I go...

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttGo where?

<b>tttLUCY (O.S.)
</b>ttt(over answering machine)
ttIt's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big
ttbrother.  Sorry I drone on.  I miss you.
ttI lo--

tThe machine cuts her off.

<b>tNEW ANGLE
</b>
tJoe and Sally have resumed their positions.  This wasn't the
tcall they were waiting for.

<b>tWIDE SHOT
</b>
tAMERICA, forty-one, and ROSA, fifty, struggle up the steps of
tthe back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come
tthrough the sliding glass door...

<b>tTHE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM
</b>
tThrough the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two
tunpack groceries, flowers, etc., and start to dress the
tdining room table.  They speak quietly to each other in
tSpanish.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttAmerica, could you just...

tAmerica closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the
tdining room, giving the couple their privacy.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(calls out)
ttThank you, America!

<b>tttSTEVEN
</b>ttOkay, let's just take a deep breath, let
ttyour ribs expand and relax.  And reach up
ttand into downward dog.

tOtis, the Bisenji/Sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard
tpillow, stirs, stretches and groans.

<b>tttJOE AND SALLY
</b>ttGood boy, Otis.

tThe phone RINGS again.

<b>tttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttt(over answering machine)
ttHello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for
ttSally Therrian.

tSally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the
tphone, all angles.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttHello, hi, hi...and?  Thank God.

tSally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to Joe.

<b>tEXT. POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tJoe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the
tteacher waiting a sign.  Sally returns to the lesson.  They
tdo their handstands against the wall, on either side of the
tfront door.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttNo luck.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttOh, well, we'll just have to try again.
ttSound like a plan?

tSally nods, she and Joe, at Steven's instructions, come out
tof their handstands and lie on the floor in a stretched
trelax, facing one another.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttHappy anniversary, baby.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttHappy anniversary.

tThey smile.

<b>tttSTEVEN
</b>ttAnd change sides...

tAmerica slides open the dining room doors.  The dining table
tis covered with bundles of freshly cut flowers.  Rosa is
tsinging in Spanish.

<b>tttAMERICA
</b>ttt(with the authority of long
ttt years of service)
ttMr. Joe, we have to have the house.  If
ttyou please now...

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttIt's yours.

tThe CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits and
tcandids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation,
ttumbling on the lawn, and the like.
tSome framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply
tleaning on a shelf.  It's clear that at least a handful are
tby the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and
tbeautiful.

tThere are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy,
tdocumenting their relationship from childhood.  There's an
tANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed
tsomewhere.

<b>tINT. BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
tJoe stands behind Sally in front of the full length mirror,
this arms around her, stroking her belly.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttI love you.  Most beautiful woman in the
ttworld.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttHardly...

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttAccept a compliment.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttI think you're the most beautiful woman
ttin the world.

tThey move toward the bed.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttWhat did you get me?

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttIn the morning, after everyone's gone and
ttthere's just us.

tShe pushes him on the bed.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttKiss my eyes.

tShe does.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttMy wrists.

tHe does.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttKiss the back of my knees.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttThrough the sweats or not?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttNot.

tShe pulls down his sweats.  She kisses the back of his knees.
tHe turns, stares up at her.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttYou didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did
ttyou?

tSally shakes her head.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttNo.  Did you?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttt(after a beat)
ttNo.  I missed that.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttI missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't
ttwe?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttWe're great.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttI mean, you're really back.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttFor good.

tThey begin to make love...the phone RINGS.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>ttDon't get it.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttWell, it might be Clair.  They're
ttthreatening not to come...

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttThey can't find a sitter...
ttt(into the receiver)
ttHello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.
ttt(she looks at Joe)
ttJust a moment.
ttt(puts the call on hold)
ttIt's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions
ttto the house.  You invited Skye fucking
ttDavidson to our anniversary party?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttOkay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell
ttyou.  It was the only chance I had to
ttmeet her.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttYou invited her to our anniversary party?
ttI didn't even invite my mother.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttShe goes on location tomorrow.  Sally,
ttI'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on
tthold.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(pissed)
ttNo, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking
ttDavidson, for fuck's sake.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttt(regards her)
ttYou want me to uninvite her?

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttNo, no of course not.  How old is she?
ttTwenty-fucking-two?

tShe gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom.  The CAMERA is
twith her.

<b>tttSALLY (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(into the bathroom mirror)
ttAnd she's a stinking fucking actress, for
ttfuck's sake.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttt(into the receiver)
ttSkye!
ttt(his face lights)
ttI'm so glad you're able to make it...it's
ttour sixth, actually.
ttt(flattered)
ttYou read the book again?  Well, no, the
ttending to chapter six...it's just that
ttit's not filmic.
ttWe tried it in an earlier draft, but, it
ttjust wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can
ttabsolutely look at that again.  If you're
ttcoming from Laurel, you want to take
ttSunset west, we're just past Will Rogers
ttState Park.  Three blocks west of that,
ttyou want to hang right.  It's about three
ttquarters of a mile up a big white thing
tton the left.

tSally's started the bath, and is watching him from the
tdoorway.  He meets her eyes mid-sentence.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>ttOh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure
ttthey're well behaved.  All our friends
tthave dogs, and they always want to bring
ttthem.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So
ttwe sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry.

tHe rolls his eyes.  Sally walks back into the bathroom, she
tisn't buying it.

<b>tttJOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>ttI'm looking forward to meeting you, too.
ttAnd Skye, I'm thrilled that you're
ttwilling to take this leap with me.
ttEternally grateful, really.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(into the bathroom mirror)
ttI'm going to throw up.

<b>tttJOE (O.S.)
</b>ttI can't imagine anyone else playing
ttGenna.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(sanguine)
ttReally?

<b>tINT. BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
tThe doorbell rings.  There are two closed doors on either
tside of the room.  The bed shows no sign of consummated sex.
tJoe comes through the left hand door, nearly dressed.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttWho the fuck can be here at this time?
ttIt's not even seven!

tSally comes through the other door, one shoe off, one on.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttOh Jesus, who else is always early for
ttChrist's sake?

<b>tNEW ANGLE
</b>
tSally kisses his cheek on her way to the door.

<b>tttSALLY (CONT'D)
</b>ttPromise you'll be nice to the neighbors.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttI'll say as little as possible.

tSally exits the bedroom.

<b>tHOLD ON JOE
</b>
tFor a moment, then Sally re-enters, kisses him deeply.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttI love you.

<b>tINT. FOYER - EARLY EVENING
</b>
tThe house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements,
tcandles everywhere.

tJERRY and JUDY ADAMS are on the porch, just beyond the glass
tof the front door.  Their argument is inaudible.  They're in
ttheir mid-thirties, conservatively dressed.  She's stunning,
tgenetically nervous.  Jerry carries a briefcase.  She's got
tthe gift.

tSally opens the door.  Hugs and buses them, hello.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttI know we're early, we're so early.
ttSorry.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttYou have to sign your taxes anyway.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(a grin)
ttOf course we do.
ttt(to Judy)
ttWe have to sign our taxes.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttt(kisses Judy; all charm)
ttYou can never be too early or too thin.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttHappy anniversary, buddy!  Six months
ttago, who would have thunk it?

tJerry hugs Joe.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttt(sotto)
ttWell, not me, to be honest.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttt(sotto)
ttDon't fuck up again.  It's got a ripple
tteffect.  Sally suffers, we all suffer.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttt(offers)
ttWe have a gift?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttThanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttLovely.

tJoe moves toward the kitchen.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttt(a moment, to Sally)
ttWe closed.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttFantastic.
ttt(takes his hand)
ttOut here.

tThey step out onto the porch.  Judy's left alone, unsure
twhether to follow or not.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttt(finally, to no one, and to no
ttt response)
ttThe house looks beautiful, are those
tthydrangeas?

tShe stands awkwardly in the middle of the foyer.

<b>tEXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttJoe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk,
ttChelsea, London, England.  No small
ttdoing.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttI love you, you're a genius.

tBehind them, in the foyer, Judy wanders aimlessly.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttI suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift.
ttI'm not sure it's in your best interest.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttI adore him.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttThe realtor'll be here tomorrow in the
ttmorning.  The house had to go on the
ttmarket to insure the loan on the London
ttflat.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttI know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttWhat you earn has to double in order to
ttcover expenses in London, it's an
ttoutrageously expensive city.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttWe've only been over this how many times?

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttYou only made half your quote this year.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttWell, you're a tower of support.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttI worry because you don't.  It's my job.
ttI'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it
ttif you waited until the two of you were
tton more solid ground.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(direct, simple)
ttWe couldn't be on more solid ground.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttWhatever you say.  Listen, I love you.

tOtis is barking.

<b>tttJOE (O.S.)
</b>ttOtis!  No barking!

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(touched)
ttAnd Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a
ttrock star in London.  His novels sell
ttmillions.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttNot millions.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttHe's directing now.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttThey're paying him scale.

tThe CAMERA catches sight of Joe behind them.  He moves
tthrough the foyer and into the living room with a tray of
tglasses and Judy in tow.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttHe gets huge advances on his novels.
ttHe's going back to that.  You know how he
tthates it here.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttThere's still time to undo this.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(kisses his cheek)
ttWe'll be fine.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttt(re: barking dog)
ttDid you invite them?

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttThe Roses?  And of course they said yes.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttThat was the plan.  And you're thrilled
ttto have them.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttWhatever you say.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttDid you tell Joe to behave?

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttDid he promise?

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttScout's honor.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttBefore I forget.
ttt(pulls a novel from his
ttt briefcase)
ttPut it on the bookshelf.

tShe flips the book -- on the back is a full page picture of
<b>tRYAN ROSE.
</b>
<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttYou're out of your mind.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttJust do what I say, alright?

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttHow much bowing and scraping do you want
ttus to do?

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttBeats a lawsuit.

<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tJoe and Judy sit on opposite sides of the sofa -- slightly
tuncomfortable with each other.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttt(to fill the silence,
ttt conspiratorial grin)
ttI love gifts.  What did you guys get us?

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttt(chokes on the champagne)
ttNothing that can't be exchanged.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttOh.  Well.  Good.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttCongratulations on the deal.  How
ttexciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean
ttit's Sally.  The character that's based
tton Sally.  The character that's based on
ttSally in the book.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttThe novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing
ttthe lead.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttOh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan.
ttShe's very beautiful.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttYes, she is.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttt(trying harder)
ttBut I am right, yes?  She's based on
ttSally.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttIt's a novel.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttStill.  Well.  Let's drop it.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttI'm not much of a reader, but I do love
ttautobiographies, even biographies
ttsometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you
ttread the new Styron?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttNo.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttIt's very good.
ttt(a moment)
ttI understand you won the Booker Prize.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttYes I did.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttt(another moment)
ttIs your script much like the novel?
ttJerry says it's very good.  But you know,
ttyou read the novel, and then you see the
ttmovie - and most of the time you say,
tt"what's this?" You know?  I sometimes
ttthink we're better off not reading the
ttnovel at all.  Because, we come with
ttexpectations... and of course, we know
ttwhere we're going.  Don't you find?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttDon't I find what?

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttI don't know why Joe, we've known each
ttother how long...

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttNot long.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttt(benign)
ttDon't be silly.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttJoking.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttYes I know.  I started to say... I
ttstarted to say Joe that --

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttDo I put you off?

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttYou manage to throw me off balance.  I
ttadore you.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttAnd I you.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttBut I'm always afraid I'll say something
ttstupid.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttAh.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttAnd so I always manage to, do you see?
ttLike the book/script thing, do you see?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttMmm hmmm.

<b>tINT. FOYER
</b>
tCAL and SOPHIA GOLD are there with their children - JACK and
tEVIE - eight and six respectively.  Carrying gifts and totes
twith toys and changes.  Jerry and Sally have gathered them up
tand ushered them in.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttYou know Jerry.

<b>tttCAL
</b>ttYes, of course.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttI'm the wife.  We've met.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttt(hugs her)
ttYou, I know.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(to Evie)
ttHey, beautiful girl.

tShe picks up the four-year-old, swings her around.  Jack
thides behind his father's legs.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttt(a grin)
ttJack?  Jack, you promised.

tThe little boy comes out from behind his father's legs,
tcovers his eyes with his hands.

<b>tttJACK
</b>ttt(sings)
ttHappy anniversary to you.  We're glad Joe
ttcame home.  Don't split up again.  Cause
ttwe like the food.

tMuch laughter and clapping.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttt(in the archway)
ttJack.  Did you compose that yourself?

<b>tttCAL
</b>ttAbsolutely.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttHad a little help?

<b>tttCAL
</b>ttAbsolutely not.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttIt has your ring.

<b>tttCAL
</b>ttI'm not that good.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttCal, my wife Judy.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttNice to meet you.

<b>tttCAL
</b>ttI think we've met, actually.  No?  At
ttanother one of these things?

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttNo, I don't think so.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttt(to Cal)
ttCongratulations on the Academy Award.
ttGreat performance.  Really warranted.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttHe thought so.

<b>tttJERRY
</b>ttSally always manages to get robbed.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(a mortified grin)
ttEnough about me.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttEvie has a little something for you.

tEvie shakes her head.

<b>tttSOPHIA (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou do.

<b>tttEVIE
</b>ttt(even)
ttI don't think so.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttSince when are you so shy?

<b>tttEVIE
</b>ttt(her mother's daughter)
ttNever.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttt(bright smile)
ttHoney, we have gifts for you and all
ttsorts of surprises.  Where is America?  I
ttknow she's here somewhere.

tJoe reaches for the gifts.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttI'll take them.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttNo, I have a little talking to do with
ttAmerica.  Privately.  I'll find her.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(to Sophia)
ttIn the kitchen.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttWho'd like to go and find Otis?

<b>tttEVIE
</b>ttMe!

<b>tttJACK
</b>ttI guess.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttThe infamous dog?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttHe's the best dog in the world.
ttt(to Judy)
ttThey're both coming tonight.  Not my
ttidea.

<b>tttJUDY
</b>ttOurs.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttIt's Jerry's worst idea.

<b>tttCAL
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttThe neighbors from hell.  The kind that
ttlay in wait.  I'd rather move actually.
ttWouldn't I?
ttt(to Sally)
ttWouldn't I?

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(small smile)
ttYes.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttt(to the kids)
ttOkay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly
ttold bum.

tJoe goes off with the children to find Otis.  Cal sits at the
tpiano, plays.

<b> ttttINT. FOYER - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tJoe holds Evie in one arm.  Jack stands beside him, holds his
thand.  MONICA and RYAN ROSE face him across the threshold --
tthe NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS.  She's in her late twenties - and
tbeautiful, eyes everywhere - star struck and house struck.
tRyan is somewhat older, a little awkward in company,
tswallowing resentment and a little self righteous.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttWell, hello you two.
ttt(putting Evie down; to Jack)
ttThese are the people who live next door.
ttSay hello.

tJack does.

<b>tttJOE (CONT'D)
</b>ttAnd close the door, Jack.  Because if we
ttleave it open, Otis will run out and you
ttknow what will happen then?

<b>tttJACK
</b>ttUh, uh.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttHe'll run next door into their backyard
ttand he'll bark and bark and bark and eat
tttheir pitbull for his dinner.  Is it a
ttpitbull?

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttt(not amused)
ttNo, actually.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttt(to Jack)
ttOh whatever.  We don't want that to
tthappen, do we?

<b>tttJACK
</b>ttNo?

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttIt's a rottweiler, actually.
ttt(to Jack)
ttI don't think our rottweiler is in any
ttdanger, Jack.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttWell, Jack and I are very relieved.

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttI thought this was a party.  Are we going
ttto talk about the dog thing?

<b>tttMONICA
</b>ttPlease, Ryan.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttt(kisses her cheek and shakes
ttt his hand)
ttNo, he's absolutely right.  You're
ttabsolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be
ttbanned.  Canine conversations are
ttcompletely discouraged... it's really
ttgood of you to join us.  Can I get you a
ttdrink?

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttNot for me, thanks.

tAn awkward moment.

<b>tttMONICA
</b>ttt(checks with Ryan)
ttSomething soft.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttRight away.  Are you sure you wouldn't

</b>ttYes.

ttWell, so glad you decided to come.

</b>ttOh?

tJoe slips the coke into Monica's hand.

<b>tttSALLY (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(takes the gift)
ttThank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I
tthope you've noticed that Otis isn't
ttbarking as much.  We keep him in at
ttnight.

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttAt 4:30 today he barked for a solid

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttYou're keeping a record, are you?

</b>ttIt's just very distracting when you're

</b>ttRyan.

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttt(to Joe)
ttI'm sure you understand.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttWell the neighborhood is full of dogs,
ttand it's not always Otis.

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttWell today it was Otis.  And you should
ttkeep him away from our yard.  Because

</b>ttRyan!

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(cuts off response from Joe; to

ttAre you working on a new book?

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttt(caught short; flattered)
ttWell, yes, actually.

<b>tttMONICA
</b>ttHe always has two or three going...

tMAC and CLAIR FORSYTHE wave from the door.  Clair's arms are

</b>ttt(re: Otis)
ttAh there's our snookums now.

ttThe gate was open?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttIt's taken care of.

<b>tttMONICA
</b>ttI think Ryan needs a new publisher.  I

</b>ttYes, great!  It's a beautiful house.

<b>tttSALLY

</b>ttTo dander.  Otis.

</b>ttDidn't I say?

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttWell, probably.

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttThey can tell from the eyelashes, you

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttt(muted)
ttOh.

tThe Roses are happy to stand there on the fringe.  Next to
tsomeone they've only seen on screen and magazine covers.

tClair's not in the least put off by them.  She manages to
tsmile at them inclusively from time to time.

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttSo they tell me.  Not soon enough, of
ttcourse.
ttt(kisses her cheek)
ttHow are you, Sal?  You look fantastic.
ttIt changes your life, you know.  A baby.
ttIt puts everything in perspective,
ttdoesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't
ttbe the center of your own world, anymore.

</b>ttt(as grounded as Clair isn't)
ttIt's an object lesson in grace.

tthe only living complete works of Shakespeare and pulls out
this most arcane quotes on occasion.

tThe CAMERA spots GINA TAYLOR through moving bodies.  Tall,

tneck... drops her two large camera bags on the floor.

tSeveral of the other guests greet her, Mac among them.

<b>tTIGHT CLOSE
</b>
tJoe sweeps her up to his arms.  It's an intimate,

tcertainly pre-Sally.  Maybe his first important love.

</b>ttt(re: the cameras)
ttI'm the hired help.

</b>ttLike Joe.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttHmm.

ttWhere are my kids?

tIt's all Monica can do to keep from putting her hand to her

tShe ushers them toward the living room.

</b>ttHappy anniversary.  You're a good match,

ttt(to Joe)
ttCan you help me with this stuff?

</b>ttt(re: one of her bags)

</b>ttt(defers)
ttSally?

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttPlease?

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttHe's impossible.  Go on then.

tJoe rips open the gift.  It's a framed black and white of
tJoe, Sally and Otis lying on the couch.  It's clear which
tphotos in the house are Gina's.  It's a breathtaking print,
tan amazing caught moment.  All light and shadow.  A touching
tstudy.

<b>tttSALLY (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(respectful of the talent)
ttIt's beautiful, thank you so much.

tJoe, moved somehow, hugs Gina to him.  Kisses her.

<b>tttJOE
</b>ttI love you,  Gina Taylor.

tSally's uncomfortable, a little jealous... feels intrusive.
tAware that Gina got there first.  Knew him when.  And always
tcaptures something naked and vulnerable in his face.

tIn the center of the room a low table with paints and crayons
tand glue and baubles.  Two child size chairs either side.
tEmpty, the table hasn't been touched.

tEvie stands against the far wall.  She wears a helmet and is
tsurrounded by toy suction arrows.  The arrows make a perfect
toutline of her head and body.  Jack stands three feet away,
tbow in hand -- the archer prepares his next shot.

<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
tCal is at the piano, charming the neighbors.  Judy chats with
tMac.  Jerry is on his cellphone, holding his Palm Pilot, his
thand pressed against his ear to block out the chatter.  Sally
tjoins Cal on the piano stool.  Sophia moves to Clair on the
tcouch, kisses her cheek.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttYou look so well, Clair.  A wraith.

ttYou think so!?  I've been working out a

</b>ttDon't you miss it?

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttNever.

</b>ttNot for a second.  Cal can have all that.

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttReally?

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttSo where is young Jonah?

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttWith a sitter.  We have a sensational

ttLike part of the family.  Amazing with

tShe inadvertently touches the beeper on her belt, and it
tbeeps.  She jumps.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttWhat is that thing?

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttSo this sitter can always reach me.  I'm

</b>ttOh.  Do you have any pictures?

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttPictures.  They're always in my tote.  I
ttleft my tote in the damn trailer.  But!
ttHe's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac
ttshrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact
ttis they probably didn't even need me for
ttthis birth.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttAre you the funniest person I know, or
ttwhat?

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttI can't think how you gave it all up,

</b>
tClair leads Sally towards the bedroom.

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttIt sounds hysterical, but Otis just
ttrubbed up against me and I'd kind of like
ttto change into something of yours.  You
ttknow it could be disaster.  He's so

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttBorrow whatever you like.

ttWhatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all

ttt(a moment)
ttAre you alright, Clair?

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttI'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little

ttget my weight down since the baby.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttI'd say it was down.

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttAnd the doctor said they might make me a

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttYou want a Tylenol, or something?

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttI'd love a Xanex.
ttt(a moment)
ttSally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttWhy would she care?

<b>tttCLAIR
</b>ttYou know Sophia.  She's so damned

</b>ttNot enough.

tSally takes Panes into the living room where everyone chats,

tnothing else.  Ryan and Monica are on the fringe, stand at
tthe edges of conversation.  There's always someone at the

ttPart of our gift.  Honey!!

<b>tttCAL
</b>ttt(clinks his glass)
ttHere, here.

tClair picks up discarded dinner plates.  Otis takes care of
tthose behind couches, under tables.

tThe gifts are stacked high, near the fireplace.  Sally is on
tthe floor, nestled between Joe's knees, leaning back against
thim.  His arms are wrapped around her, face pressed against
thers.

tThere's a SERIES OF CUTS through speeches, gifts,
tentertainment.  Sophia and Cal do a well rehearsed, very
tfunny, impromptu something with their kids.

tPanes and Mac do an interpretive dance symbolizing the
tmarriage.

tCal and Sophia carry sleeping children down the hall.

tThere are speeches about Sally and Joe, outrageously dirty,
tfunny, sometimes touching - that cover their recent
tseparation, the custody of Otis, their trying to have a
tbaby...

tPanes plays a piece on the violin.  Someone else sings.  And

<b>tttSKYE
</b>ttAnd I brought a gift of love.  A gift

tpaper all over the room.

tThe drug has begun to take effect.  The party is now in full

tPeople are swimming, some naked, some in swimsuits.  Judy
tfloats around the pool on an inflatable dog.

tSally and Skye cuddle together on one of the benches round
tthe pool, chatting; a friendly, feely touchy conversation.
tJoe passes around bottles of water and chewing gum to
teveryone, emceeing the event.

tEveryone is relaxed and open, except Ryan, who sits beside
tMonica at the edge of the garden, separated from the others.

ttt sensation)
ttUtterly fantastic.

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttYou know what Sally Therrian was saying
ttabout your spine and your brain?  She
ttdidn't pull that out of thin air.  It
ttcauses brain damage.  You'd better drink

<b>tttMONICA
</b>ttDo you want to go home, Ryan?

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttYes.

</b>ttI think you should then.  You should look

</b>ttI think you need to speak for yourself,

tShe puts arms around him, kisses his cheek.  He stiffens.

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttAre you making an ass of yourself?

<b>tttMONICA
</b>ttThere's only you, Ryan.  You know what,
ttRyan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so
ttmuch... You need...

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttI don't need a drug.

<b>tttMONICA
</b>ttYou need a good review and you'll be

tShe gets up.

<b>tttRYAN
</b>ttReady to go?

<b>tttMONICA
</b>ttI'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do
ttknow, Ryan, this is non addictive so you
ttmustn't worry.
ttt(turns back)
ttRyan, you're a great man.

tThe CAMERA follows Monica along the side of the pool.  She
tpasses Sophia and a very exuberant Clair.

tThe CAMERA stays at the pool.  Clair tears off Sally's
tGaliano, flings it to the ground and dives topless into the
tpool.

</b>ttThis water is great!

</b>ttOkay, I'm about to throw five colored

tSally's taken Gina's photograph of them from the mantelpiece

tboth bopping to the music.

<b>tttSALLY

ttIsn't this a fabulous picture?

</b>ttYes.

</b>ttShe's such a great photographer.

</b>ttHm.

<b>tttSALLY
</b>ttSo where should I put it?

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttI thought it was okay where it was.

</b>ttIt's much more personal in here.

</b>ttA notch above the storage room.

</b>ttWe're always in here.

ttShe really gets him, doesn't she?

</b>ttThe both of you.

tThey both laugh, then...

ttI trust you.

</b>ttOh Soph...

</b>ttYou'll hate it in London.  It's wet and

ttIt's socialized.  Beds in the corridors.
ttTerrible plumbing.

</b>ttAnd the food sucks, I know.

<b>tttSOPHIA
</b>ttYou are not having your baby in London.
ttYou're going to have your baby at Cedars

ttOh God, you're so lucky you don't have

</b>ttOkay.  If we could've, by some miracle,

ttBecause I don't mean anything as a
