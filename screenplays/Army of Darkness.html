</b><b>1t  GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACEt 1
</b>t   This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
t   haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
t   the CAMERA with urgency:
<b>ttttt   ASH
</b>ttt   Why would you say that I am
ttt   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've
ttt   lost my mind simply because I've
ttt   heard the voices and seen the
ttt   godless things moving in the
ttt   woods. If anything, I think more
ttt   clearly now than ever before. I
ttt   know now that there is such a
ttt   thing as a living Evil. A dark
ttt   and shapeless thing that lives
ttt   not in the spaces we know, but
ttt   between them. In the Dark. In the
ttt   night. And it wants the exact same
ttt   thing as you and I: a chance at
ttt   warm life on this Earth. It
ttt   doesn't care that is already had
ttt   that chance ...once. Now listen
ttt   closely because there isn't much
ttt   time. Listen and believe, because
ttt   it's all true.
<b>ttttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>2t  EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHTtttttttt2
</b>t   nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
t   figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
<b>ttttt   ASH (V.O.)
</b>ttt   I first saw the damn thing at that
ttt   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
ttt   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
ttt   in human flesh and inked in human
ttt   blood. It contained bizarre burial
ttt   rites, prophesies...and
ttt   instruction for demon
ttt   resurrection. It was never meant
ttt   for the world of the living.

<b>ttttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>3t  INT. CABIN - NIGHTttttttttt 3
</b>t   Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
<b>ttttt   ASH (V.O.)
</b>ttt   The book awoke something dark in
ttt   the woods.
<b>ttttttttt   SUPERIMPOSE:
</b><b>4t  BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPTttt 4
</b>t   inscribed on the pages.  Illustrations of demonic faces with
t   white eyes.
<b>5t  EXT. WOODS - NIGHTttttttttt 5
</b>t   We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
t   through the woods toward the cabin.  CAMERA rips through the
t   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
<b>ttttt   ASH (V.O.)
</b>ttt   It got into my hand and it went
ttt   bad.
<b>6t  CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HANDttttttt6
</b>t   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
<b>ttttt   ASH (V.O.)
</b>ttt   So I lopped it off at the wrist.
<b>7t  INT. CABIN - NIGHTttttttttt 7
</b>t   ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
<b>8t  BLOOD RED CLOUDSttttttttt   8
</b>t   sweep past the moon.
<b>ttttt   ASH (V.O.)
</b>ttt   In order to rid myself of the foul
ttt   thing, I read from a passage in
ttt   the book that was supposed to open
ttt   a hole.  A hole in Time that would
ttt   send the Evil back. And it worked.
<b>9t  A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASHttttttt   9
</b>t   recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.
<b>10t EXT. CABIN - NIGHTttttttttt 10
</b>t   The Time vortex is created.  Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
t   Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
<b>ttttt   ASH (V.O.)
</b>ttt   ...I just didn't plan on coming
ttt   along.
<b>11t EXT. CABIN - NIGHTttttttttt 11
</b>t   Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
t   funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.
<b>12t INT. TIME VORTEXttttttttt   12
</b>t   Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.  He is
t   swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
t   Time.
<b>13t ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKEtttttt    13
</b>t   swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
t   to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.  The smoke
t   swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
t   words:
<b>ttttt   "BRUCE CAMPBELL"
</b>ttttt   "Vs"
t   The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
<b>ttttt   "THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
</b>t   The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...
<b>14t INT. TIME VORTEXttttttttt   14
</b><b>t   A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
</b>t   its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily
t   past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this
t   funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
<b>15t ASHtttttttttttt 15
</b>t   He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady
t   BEATING of his heart.
<b>16t ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTIONttttt   16
</b>t   He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.  The funnel
t   cloud electrifies.
<b>17t ASH'S BODYtttttttttt    17
</b>t   RIPS at the fabric of Time.
<b>18t EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAYtttttttt   18
</b>t   All is quiet.  Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of
t   a human body flashes briefly and is gone.  A moment latter, Ash
t   appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA.
<b>19t EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAYttttttt  19
</b>t   ASH falls to the dust.  His double barrelled shotgun lands
t   beside him.  The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground
t   a moment later.
<b>20t ASHtttttttttttt 20
</b>t   looks up from the dust to behold...
<b>21t TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMENttttttt 21
</b>t   in 12th century armor ride up over a hill.  They halt before
t   Ash.
<b>22t WARRIOR #1tttttttttt    22
</b>t   thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting:
<b>ttttt   WARRIOR #1
</b>ttt   Hail to him who has come from the
ttt   sky to deliver us from the terror
ttt   of the Deadites!  Hail!
<b>23t ASHtttttttttttt 23
</b>t   stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.
<b>24t TWENTY-FIVE WARRIORttttttttt24
</b>t   join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
<b>25t ARTHURttttttttttt   25
</b>t   the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into
t   frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur
t   lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.
<b>26t ARTHUR'S P.O.V.ttttttttt    26
</b>t   The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back.
t   The handless stump of Ash's right arm.  The Shotgun.
<b>27t A FRIGHTENED ASHttttttttt   27
</b>t   waves a shaky hand.
<b>ttttt   ASH
</b>ttt   Take is easy now chief. I don't
ttt   know how I got here and I'm not

<b>28t WISEMAN JOHNtttttttttt  28

ttt   the promised one, written of in
ttt   the Necronomicon.
<b>29t ARTHURttttttttttt   29
</b>t   Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain
t   as...
<b>30t ASH'S CHESTtttttttttt   30
</b>t   is cut. A thin red gash.
<b>ttttt   ARTHUR
</b>ttt   He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The
ttt   one written of in the Book would
ttt   not bleed.
<b>31t ARTHUR GESTURESttttttttt    31

<b>ttttt   ARTHUR

t   and yanks again.
<b>61t THE SECOND HORSEMANttttttttt61

t   mightily.  The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!

<b>79t INT. CASTLE COURTYARDtttttttt   79
</b><b>t   SHEILA

<b>ttttt   SHEILA

<b>t   SHEILA
</b>t   Her face does not immediately register the grief.  She attempts
t   to step forward but stumbles.  She steadies herself against the
t   stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
t   shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.
t   She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks
t   at him as he's dragged along.
<b>ttttt   SHEILA

<b>82t ASHtttttttttttt 82
