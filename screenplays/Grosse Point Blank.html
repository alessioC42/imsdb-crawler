<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tROLL CREDITS OVER:
</b>
<b>tEXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN
</b>
tVARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of 
tbrilliant greens:

<b>tA POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD
</b>
tpops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew-
tsoaked lawn.

<b>tFLEET OF DUCKLINGS
</b>
tNo mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes.

<b>tGRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER
</b>
tAt the bottom of a water hazard.

<b>tPALM FRONDS
</b>
tAfter a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that 
tsurrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the 
tair. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt 
tCobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the 
tpalms to

<b>tA BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.
</b>
tJust on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers 
tmoves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips 
tit out. The trousers walk out after it.

<b>tHANDS
</b>
tDigging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a 
tgolf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are 
tgloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.

<b>tYELLOW TROUSERS
</b>
tIn a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot 
tjourney to the hole. The figure positions himself and the 
tputter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball 
trolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards 
tand finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green 
tand into the hole.

<b>tTHE GLOVED HAND
</b>
tSets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather 
tgolf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the 
tbag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing 
tout a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. 
tThe figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot 
tfirmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the 
tface of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half-
tsquat. He is MARTIN BLANK.

tWe SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with 
thim. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, 
tanother green is barely visible through groves of trees and 
trough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. 
tOne of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He 
tcould be an investment banker, or an arms trader.

<b>tMARTIN'S ARM
</b>
tFlinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second 
tlater in the distance, the

<b>tRED SWEATER'S HEAD
</b>
tSeems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His 
tbody crumples to the green.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tReturns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to 
tthe tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers 
tabsently...

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttHooked it. 

<b>tINT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER
</b>
tThe outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf 
tclub. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between 
ta group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like 
tpeace in his eyes through the philosophical talk.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttI'd come to the realization that 
tteverything I'd based my life on was 
ttfalse. And that my life had no 
ttmeaning.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #2
</b>ttt(to Martin)
ttHe gets this way when he hits over 
tteighty-five.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttIt seemed like my life was slipping 
ttaway, somehow. I was a knot in the 
ttmiddle of a wet rope. Everything was 
ttfutile and nothing had value.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #3
</b>ttThat's the way life is. The only 
ttmeaning and value is what we create. 
ttThrough structure, and discipline. 
ttThough they seem to limit our freedom, 
ttthey actually give us great comfort. 
ttYour problem is you're looking for 
ttsome great answer. Some ultimate 
tttruth. When what you really should 
ttdo is go to work and go home.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #2
</b>ttAnd take golf lessons.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttThat's a tragedy. Can I finish my 
ttstory please? I began my search for 
ttmeaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, 
ttScientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I 
ttwent to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, 
ttherbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, 
ttand a psychic. And they all pretty 
ttmuch say the same stuff.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #2
</b>ttA Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are 
tttelling you the same thing? You're 
ttinsane.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttBasically the same thing. In a very 
ttevolved, esoteric way.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #2
</b>ttInsane.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttTo make a long story short...

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #3
</b>tt--Thank God--

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>tt...at last I found the holistic system 
ttof systems that opened up the doors 
ttof heaven for me right here on earth. 
ttAnd everyday I see the world through 
ttthe eyes of a child. A world of 
ttcreation and wonder.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #2
</b>ttJesus...

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttOverflowing with love.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttTell me about it.

tClub Member #1 turns to Martin.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttP.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the 
ttsecrets of your universe are divided 
ttup into eight easily digestible 
ttslices.

tClub Member #1 pulls a laminated card from his wallet and 
thands it over to Martin. In the distance, sirens begin to 
twail.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttSee, see. It's in the accessible and 
tteveryday shape of a pan pizza. Each 
ttday you have a little slice of 
ttpeace...

<b>tINSERT - WALLET-SIZE P.P.P. CARD
</b>
tA pizza-shaped diagram showing six "sections".

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttOh I see. You got your individual 
ttslices of hope, dignity, confidence, 
ttself-love, justice, and harmony.

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttYou open 'em up and there's the 
ttsayings, stories, little bites of 
ttinsight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day 
ttWeek.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttSo you eat-- read it everyday?

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttAnd these pan pizzas have opened up 
ttthe doors to heaven?

<b>tttt  CLUB MEMBER #1
</b>ttCorrect.
ttt(re: the card)
ttThat's for you. Keep it.

tSirens are getting louder, closer to the club.

<b>tEXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY
</b>
tThe source of the sirens are almost upon us. Martin walks 
ttoward his rented Town Car as the VALET pulls it up. He meets 
tthe Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.

<b>tttt  MARTIN AT CAR
</b>ttHe fishes out the laminated "Personal 
ttPan Power" card, looks at it, and 
tttosses it onto the ground. Police 
ttcars, now visible in the distance, 
ttwind into the long club driveway. 
ttMartin gets into his car and pulls 
ttaway.

<b>tLAMINATED CARD
</b>
tAs it lays on the asphalt. The wheel of a police car rolls 
tto a stop on it.

<b>tINT. AIRLINER - DAY
</b>
tMartin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped 
tdown. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines 
tof all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, 
tRolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, 
tand on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, 
timpassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is 
tdone with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to 
thim and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and 
tmassively uploading the world around him:

tToothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, 
tcrouched starving child with vulture in the background, 
tsupermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm 
tin arm, smiling, etc.

<b>tINT. HIRED CAR, NEW YORK - DAY
</b>
tThe livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at Kennedy airport. 
tMartin reclines in the back seat, a conversation having 
talready begun.

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttHow was your day, today, sir?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttEffective. But to tell you the truth, 
ttI've lost my passion for work.

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttDo you like the people you work with?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI work alone.

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttThat's it then. That's it. I've always 
ttbeen alone. That's why I'm a good 
ttdriver. I can handle it. See, I can 
ttthink on my feet. I survive, I'm a 
ttthinker. And I can sit there in front 
ttof your house for two hours and it 
ttdon't bother me. Some people can't 
ttdo it! Some people are ranting and 
ttraving, "Tell them fuckin' people to 
ttget out here and get in this car, I 
ttcan't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna 
ttgo? You're gonna wind up back in 
ttyour garage at seven o'clock at night. 
ttYou ain't going nowhere. You leave 
ttyour house in the morning you get 
ttback to your house in the evening. 
ttWhat's the big deal, right?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttYou understand the psychology of the 
ttjob.

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttI do. Some guys can't adjust to it; 
ttthey can't handle it.

<b>tINT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER
</b>
tThe car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the 
tDriver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror.

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttYou look like you're far away. Far 
ttaway and thinking about other things. 
ttI'm right about that, aren't I?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttNo.

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttWell, let's just say that sometimes 
ttI'm right. Sometimes you are.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttSometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only 
ttnatural.

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttt(laughs to himself at 
tttthis great truth)
ttIt's only natural....

tThe Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttI been looking at you, and I've 
ttdecided that I want to share something 
ttwith you.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttOkay.

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttBecause your problem is you're bored. 
ttAnd you have a very big mind.
ttt(beat)
ttI am part of what I call a brain 
ttsyndicate.

tNo reaction from Martin.

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttI am part of a network of minds, a 
ttgroup of five people who are all 
ttconnected, over hundreds, even 
ttthousands of miles, through the mind. 
ttWe can think with each other, think 
ttfor each other. I can be driving 
ttsomewhere, sleeping with a woman-- 
ttwhatever it is-- and at the same 
tttime be thinking a thought in someone 
ttelse's mind, far away. Running someone 
ttelse's brain.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttt(indicates)
ttUp on the right.

<b>tttt  DRIVER
</b>ttAnd when you think of it, it's not 
ttso surprising that a small group of 
ttpeople control the whole world, is 
ttit?

<b>tINT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY
</b>
tA sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper 
tEast Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows 
twatching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across 
tthe street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts 
tit back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves 
tto the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, 
tdepresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for 
ta moment.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttIf it's not there, I can't proceed. 
ttTell them.

tMartin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he 
twaits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying 
ton the bed.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttTom. I've been waiting for an answer. 
ttI'm only in town tonight.

tHe breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished 
tmetal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a 
tsilencer.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWhat's different this time than the 
ttlast time? I have to be down front...

<b>tINT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME
</b>
tMartin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the 
tscope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests 
tacross the arm of a chair.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>tt...I don't bother to call anyone 
ttelse because you always take care of 
ttme.

tHe glances over to a second window to his left, which offers 
ta view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the 
tscope and sees

<b>tMARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2
</b>
tA few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, 
tis your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing 
tgear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across 
this right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is 
thidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttHold on a second, Tom. I got my hands 
ttfull here.

tHe sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching 
tthe messenger.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttGood. Account number 3649367, transfer 
ttto account number 96-546-38739-47825. 
ttAsk for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's 
ttMr. Duckman. If there are any 
ttproblems, access file 673594638-IO-
tt98, and look at it.

tMartin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the 
trifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the 
thigh-rise.

<b>tMARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #1
</b>
tOf a DOORMAN opening the door for a group of five men in 
tsuits. Four BODYGUARDS form a perimeter around the fifth 
tman, a mall, avuncular figure in his forties dressed in 
tSaville Row finery.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tTakes a step back into the shadows of the room, and raises 
tthe rifle toward Window #2.

<b>tMARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #2
</b>
tof an empty street. The bicycle messenger flashes past.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tconcentrating, tracks the path of the Messenger, leading him 
tleft to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall 
tbetween Window #2 and Window #1.

<b>tSTREET
</b>
tthe bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing 
ta Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag. The group see him-- 
tjust as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. 
tTwo of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other 
ttwo open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into 
ta parked car in front of them.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
twithdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and 
tbegins to break down the rifle.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttSorry Tom. But look, I know it's the 
ttplayoffs. That's why I'm offering a 
ttthousand dollars for one seat...

tMartin listens patiently as he works.

<b>tEXT. STREET - SAME - INTERCUT
</b>
<b>tDOORMAN'S HANDS
</b>
tunbuttoning his double-breasted long coat.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tjust finishes packing.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>tt...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do 
ttI have to do to get courtside tickets 
ttfor the Knicks...?

<b>tSTREET
</b>
tThe two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body. The other 
ttwo begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering. The 
tDoorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat.

<b>tDOORMAN
</b>
ta tall, dark, sharp-featured man in his forties, wearing a 
thandlebar moustache. He moves toward the group of men as he 
tflips open his coat back over two huge chrome .44 Magnum 
tCharthouse Bulldog revolvers and OPENS FIRE on them.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tis closing his bag when he hears the gun-thunder.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttNever mind. I gotta go.

tMartin drops the phone, grabs his scope, and spins to the 
twindow.

<b>tMARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE
</b>
tof the Doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards. 
tHe gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss. The Doorman 
tFIRES both guns.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
treacts, surprised to see a second shooter. He pulls himself 
tfrom the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his 
texit.

<b>tHIGH-RISE FOYER
</b>
tOutside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of 
tbodies. He walks back toward us through the glass doors and 
tmakes his way through the building toward the service exit. 
tHe sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
this two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel 
tand walks down the street.

<b>tDOORMAN
</b>
tnow wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, 
twalks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off.

<b>tINT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY
</b>
tMartin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again 
ton the cellular.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>tt...Tell them that's not my problem. 
ttI was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- 
ttnot two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttWait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttPatch him through....

tMartin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We 
trecognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is 
<b>tGROCER.
</b>
<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWhat do you want?

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttI'm setting up a concern that would 
ttenable those of us in our rarefied 
ttprofession to consolidate our efforts.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttLike a union?

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttLike a club. Work less, make more.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttThank you, no.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttWe could be working together, making 
ttbig money, killing important people... 
ttI'm willing to let you in on the 
ttground floor.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttAnd you could be... sort of like... 
tta father figure to me....

tGrocer ignores this.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttIt's a free-market evolution. You'll 
ttwake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used 
ttto run together when you were a 
ttrookie. I don't want to run against 
ttyou. This thing's real. Everybody's 
ttin.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttNot me. So don't paw at me with your 
ttdirty little guild.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttI'm gonna get you, kid.

tMartin hangs up and pulls away.

<b>tINT. AIRLINER - DAY
</b>
tMartin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with 
tan airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again 
tspeeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. 
tHe looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees 
tand partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon...

<b>tINT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT
</b>
tMartin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily 
tdrops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall.

<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
tMartin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On 
tthe coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin 
tbottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes 
tthem down with a reddish-orange beverage.

<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
tMartin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are 
tclosed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps 
this chest.

<b>tttt  WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>tt"Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's 
ttbeen ten years? Where are you now...?

tAfter a moment, his eyes open, alerted. His head turns to 
tthe side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones.

<b>tCLOSE-UP: WIRE
</b>
tfrom the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with 
tone unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a 
twalkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the 
tbox, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to 
tthe floor.

<b>tttt  WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>tt...Are you guiding an Outward Bound 
ttcanoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or 
ttperhaps in charge of appearances for 
ttthe NFL like Leslie Gunther....?

<b>tMARTIN - A MINUTE LATER
</b>
tdraws a pre-cut section of the floor, the width of a pencil 
tand twice as long, by a string.

<b>tVIDEO MONITOR - A MINUTE LATER
</b>
tThe greenish Starlight (night vision) image of a young, HUSKY 
tMAN sleeping on his back, as seen from above. A fine thread 
tsnakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. 
tWe PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. 
tKEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers 
tthe thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole 
tin the floor.

<b>tMARTIN - A MINUTE LATER
</b>
tconcentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the 
tthread. As the drops run down along the thread through the 
tfloor, his attention shifts to the

<b>tVIDEO MONITOR
</b>
tThe drops, huge in the foreground, become smaller as they 
tmake their way down the line toward the sleeping man.

<b>tttt  WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>tt...Could it be that you're like Chip 
ttLongfellow, at the trade-relations 
tttank in Washington. Sandy Glasser 
ttowns a cheese shop...!

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tadjusts the thread minutely with one hand, and lowers the 
tfiber-optic cable with the other.

<b>tVIDEO MONITOR
</b>
tThe face begins to fill the screen as the fiber-optic follows 
tthe drops toward it. Suddenly, the man snorts and turns his 
tface...

<b>tA DROP FALLS
</b>
tIt misses the man's mouth and hit's his cheek.

<b>tVIDEO MONITOR
</b>
tThe man's eyes snap open in terror as he looks directly into 
tCAMERA. His image falls away as the fiber-optic is jerked 
tback up through the hole in the floor.

<b>tttt  WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>tt...Looking at yearbooks and pictures 
ttevokes so many memories...!

<b>tttt  MARTIN (V.O.)
</b>ttt(hushed)
ttFuck!

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tstuffs the apparati into an open duffel bag, and flies out 
tof frame.

<b>tttt  WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>tt...Some good. Some bad. But all 
ttinteresting...

<b>tINT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tA BODYGUARD sits outside an apartment door. A muffled but 
tdire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet, gun 
tin hand. An exit door in the hallway slams open revealing 
tMartin, his gun already pointed at the Bodyguard. The 
tBodyguard levels his at Martin.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttFreeze! Police!

tThe Bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get double-tapped 
tthrough the head.

<b>tttt  WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>tt...As a graduate of the class of 
tt1984, you are someone special...

tMartin moves to the dead Bodyguard, and locates a retractable 
tkey chain on his belt. He unreels the ring of keys and opens 
tthe door. He lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags 
thim into the apartment.

<b>tINT. HUSKY MAN'S APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER
</b>
tMartin moves silently down the hall in a crouch. He comes to 
tthe bedroom and slips across the threshold.

<b>tttt  WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>tt...Whenever news of you filters back, 
ttthe school is excited and proud of 
ttyour accomplishments...

<b>tINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tMartin crouches down outside the bedroom door. He points the 
tgun at the door, and reaching up turns the knob. As the door 
topens, the Husky Man FIRES wildly over Martin's head. Martin 
treturns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on 
tthe floor.

<b>tttt  WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>tt...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared 
ttyou well to lead the kind of life 
ttthat makes an impact on the world...

tMartin kicks the gun away from the fallen man, and raises 
this barrel to the man's forehead.

<b>tttt  WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>tt...Remember, "there's no where you 
ttcan go that you haven't learned how 
ttto go in time... It's easy..."

<b>tttt  HUSKY MAN
</b>ttt(in severe pain)
ttWhatever it is that I'm doing that 
ttyou don't like I'll stop doing it.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttIt's not me.

tMartin cocks the gun....

<b>tEXT. EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY, LOS ANGELES - DAY
</b>
tThe perpetual sun shines down on a small lot of pre-fab office 
tbungalows.

<b>tINT. BLANK HOLDING COMPANY
</b>
tA small suite of dry-walled offices.

<b>tEAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY
</b>
tis stenciled on glass doors behind Martin who stands in front 
tof a young woman reading from some kind of invitation. She 
tis MARCELLA MAYES.

tMarcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly. For 
tthe first time, Martin looks scared.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttThrow that away.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttThis?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttDon't tease me. You know what I do 
ttfor a living.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttIt's from one of those P.O. Boxes. 
ttHow was the trip?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttTedious. I now authorize you to throw 
ttaway all personal mail.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttAll of it?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttAnd not show it to me. Ever again.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttThat's going to cost.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI'll pay.

tMartin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella 
tstops him.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttThey're not happy, sir.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI'm not happy.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttThey say their friend was suppose to 
tthave a heart attack and die in his 
ttsleep.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttHe didn't.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttThey blame you for the compromise.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttAnd they want me to make up for it.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttIn Detroit. This weekend.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttTell them that's impossible. I need 
ttmy normal lead time.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttThey were very upset.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWould you describe their position as 
ttinflexible?

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttIntractable, sir. You leave tonight.

tMarcella looks concerned.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttAnd sir, I also get that broken-
ttmirror, black-cat, Friday-the-
ttthirteenth kind of feeling about 
ttthis one....

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttThere's nothing to be done about it.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttI liquidated the last account in 
ttZurich, and split it into two new 
ttones in Estonia.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttGood. What else? Anything interesting?

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttMmm, not really. But you're gonna 
ttlove this one.

tShe hands him a piece of paper. He scans it.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttEnough?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttNever enough.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttBut it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be 
ttso easy.

tMartin looks at her wearily. He puts it into the paper 
tshredder at the side of her desk.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI have scruples. Next.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttPaperwork on the Detroit thing. It's 
tta full dossier. Very comprehensive.

tShe raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk 
tand puts it down again. Martin moves through a door to his 
tprivate office.

<b>tMARTIN'S OFFICE
</b>
tMartin goes into his office and sits at his desk. On the 
twalls are a couple of boring prints of tallships. A bookshelf 
tholds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover-- a few shipping 
tmanifests, sealane tables, and other specialized reference 
tbooks on import/export. He sits and stares.

<b>tNEW ANGLE
</b>
tTime has passed, and Martin still sits at his desk massaging 
this gums with a rubber-tipped dental pointer.

<b>tC.U. MARTIN'S TEETH
</b>
tThe dental tool jumps across the gaps between his teeth like 
ta hummingbird.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttt(off-screen)
ttYou should get going....

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tpulls back his jacket lapel and fits the utensil into a pocket 
tprotector that is also home to a toothbrush, emery board, 
ttweezers, and comb. He stands and walks out of his office.

<b>tFOYER
</b>
tMartin moves toward the door. As he passes Marcella she hands 
thim the mauve envelope and a travel portfolio.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttDon't forget your identity.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttSee you next week.

tMartin stops short as he reaches the threshold. He holds up 
tthe envelope, and stares a dagger through it. On his way 
tout, over his shoulder...

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttTell Dr. Oatman I'm on my way.

<b>tINT. DR. OATMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tMartin slouches on a leather couch. He holds the mauve 
tenvelope, now open.

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
</b>ttWhy don't you want to go to your 
tthigh school reunion?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttIt's in Michigan. Honestly, what do 
ttI have in common with those people? 
ttOr with anyone?

tDR. OATMAN sits in the window. He is Kris Kringle-esque, and 
twears a sheepskin vest, rough-hewn shirt, faded Levis, and 
told Frye boots. Oatman nods with the suave understanding of 
ta man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking 
ta tough question.

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttYou went to school with these people.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttCome on.

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttWe've spent a lot of time discussing 
ttthose years. Remember we said that 
ttfear is a transfer of the bodily 
tthurt associated by experience with 
ttthe thing feared, to the thought of 
ttthe thing. Thus we fear a dog without 
ttdistinctly imagining its bite.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttShouldn't you be taking notes?

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttTell me about your vision of the 
ttreunion.

<b>tCLOSE-UP - MARTIN
</b>
<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:

</b>
tOf a crowded gymnasium. The alumni below stops what they are 
tdoing and look up at Martin, DRAWING GUNS OF ALL SHAPES AND 
<b>tSIZES AND OPEN FIRE ON MARTIN. THE UNITED FORCE INSTANTLY 
</b><b>tDISINTEGRATES, AND ALL 400 PEOPLE TURN THEIR GUNS ON EACH 
</b><b>tOTHER. A BLOODBATH ENSUES. ONE ALUMNI SHOOTS HER OWN HEAD 
</b><b>tOFF, ANOTHER MOWS DOWN THE BAR, ETC.
</b>
<b>ttttttt   CUT BACK TO:
</b>
<b>tMARTIN AND OATMAN
</b>
<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttIt'll be depressing.

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttHow do you know?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI just know.

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttSay more.

</b>ttThey'll have husbands and wives and

ttAnd they can talk about what they 
ttdo. What am I going to say?
ttt(sarcastic)
tt"I killed the President of Paraguay 
ttwith a fork."

tOatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee.

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttYou needn't be so frank with me about 
ttyour work.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWhy not. I trust you. You couldn't 
ttturn me in because of Doctor-Patient 
ttprivilege... and I don't want to be 
tt"withholding"... and I know where 
ttyou live.

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttYou know where I live?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWe're both professionals, Oatman.

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttI think what you fear Martin is 
ttdomesticity. It's the greatest fear 
ttthat men have who belong to Western 
ttCulture. It's centuries old. Like 
ttKing Phillip, in the 11th or 12th 
ttcentury who decided one day that he 
ttwas so bored with his dreary life at 
tthome with his wife he thought, "Well, 
ttwouldn't it be great if we hit the 
ttroad and fought... oh... the 
ttSaracens."  So he put the word out 
ttand was amazed when a million men 
ttsigned up and all of them wanted to 
ttgo and fight in distant lands and do 
ttterrible things to people rather 
ttthan stay at home with their families.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttSo you're saying that Ulysses--
tteverything he said to his queen when 
tthe came back--everything was a lie? 
ttHe just wanted to fuck around?

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttYes.

</b>ttMmm.

tBeat.

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttAnd how have you been feeling about 
ttyour... work lately?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttUneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's 
ttjust getting hard to go to work in a 
ttgood mood. I'm starting to think 
ttI've been in the business too long. 
ttLast week I did a guy younger than 
ttme.

</b>
tFrom the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount 
tthe altar.  A priest in fact.

<b>tMARTIN'S HANDS
</b>
topen the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. He removes it, 
tsquirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. He 
treturns the chalice to the cabinet.

<b>tttt  MARTIN (V.O.)
</b>ttThe church seems to be purging itself 
ttof it's pedophile.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tSits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann. He 
twatches the PRIEST lift the chalice into the air, murmur a 
tprayer, and drink from it. The Priest collapses behind the 
taltar.

<b>tttt  MARTIN (V.O.)
</b>ttIt's a bull market.

</b>
tThe chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits 
tthe ground.

<b>tttt  MARTIN (V.O.)
</b>ttAnyway, that never use to happen. I 
ttwas always the prodigy. Now I'm just 
ttone of the guys.

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)

tOatman's glad the session's just about over.

<b>tINT. CONDO - NIGHT
</b>
tVery dark. No pictures or plants. Almost no furniture, and 
twhat he does have is black. The only sign of life is a CAT. 
tThe cat watches on as Martin sorts through a cardboard box, 
tfinally coming to a photo album.

<b>tttt  CAT
</b>ttMeow.

</b>ttJust a minute.

tA teen-aged Martin Blank: shy boy with a nervous smile. He 
tposes with his mother, an older woman with a kind smile... 
tbut her eyes are dark; aged by a life of work and worry. On 
tthe opposing page is a gilt funeral announcement that reads: 
<b>t"IN LOVING MEMORY... VISTOR ALLEN BLANK...."
</b>

tA photograph of a tall, thin girl: a bright smile from within 
ta bulky winter coat. A girl he's always wondered about: DEBI 
tNEWBERRY. Handwritten on the photo in girlish loops: "Would

</b>ttMeow!

<b>tINT. KITCHEN - SAME
</b>
tMartin pulls himself away from the album and the cat follows 
thim, moaning hungrily--

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttFood soon...

tMartin opens a restaurant-style refrigerator. It holds various 
tbottles of vitamins, spirulina, wheatgrass, digestible 
thydrogen peroxide, fluoride treatment, oxygenated mouth rinse, 
tand thirty cans of CATFOOD.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttTuna or liver?

<b>tttt  CAT
</b>ttMeow.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttTuna it is.

tHe opens a can for the cat and a bottle for himself. While 
tthe cat eats, he returns to the cardboard box. Finds a 
tYEARBOOK. Flips it open....

</b>
tTrack light fills the gourmet-rustic kitchen. GROCER stands, 
twearing a burgundy Fila sweat suit, pushing beets into a 
tvegetable juicer. Next to the juicer are piles of celery and 
tcarrots, as well. A low-key BLIP is heard from another room. 
tGrocer tops off the glass and takes it out of the kitchen.

<b>tINT. GROCER'S GREAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

tmoment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer 
tbeeps.

t  "confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471"

tGrocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A 
tgraphic appears:

tt"Connection is terminated/ Status idle"

tGrocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his 
tjuice glass to the computer in a lazy toast.

<b>tINT. PLANE - NIGHT
</b>
tMartin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest 
ton the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and 
tthey are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside 
ta Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, 
the sets the book down and takes up Iron John.

<b>tINT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING

tAt the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, 
ttwo Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in 
tblazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing 
tcrowd.

<b>tttt  LARDNER

ttthat. I'm telling you, you never met

</b>ttLisbon?

<b>tttt  MCCULLERS
</b>ttIn Portugal, yes.

tIn the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down 
tthe hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, 
tdrop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave.

<b>tttt  LARDNER
</b>ttHere's the news: He hasn't been in

ta spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and 
tbee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...

tEXCHANGE FIRE John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped

tlooks up from some reading. "Naxefve Melody" by the Talking 
tHeads plays in the studio.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttAre you going to the reunion?

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttNo. I'm not going. Is that why you're 
tthere?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttThat's part of it.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttWell, you'll have a ball. You seem 
ttto have everything everybody wants 
ttwhen they go back. The car, the suit, 
ttthe watch. The look. That just leaves 
ttthe little things, like happiness, 
ttcharacter, point of view...

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttIt's always the little things.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttYep.

tBeat.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI'm wondering how you've been. How 
ttyou are. I'd like to catch up with 
ttyou. If it's possible.

tBeat as Debi considers. She spins her seat to face him.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttOkay. Let's catch up. You go first.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWell, there's not much to tell.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttI'm sure you've done worthwhile things 
ttin the last ten years. You've had 
ttexperiences.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttBad experiences.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttYou met people.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttBad people.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttWatched television?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttBad television.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttt(amused)
ttJesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It 
ttsounds like you need a Shockabuku.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttIt's a swift spiritual kick to the 
tthead that alters your reality forever.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttThat'd be good.

tBeat.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttWhat do you want?

tThe question is open.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI figured I could pick you up tomorrow 
ttaround seven o'clock.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttLet me get this straight, are you 
ttasking me out?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttUnbelievable.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttSeven it is.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttI'll think about it.

<b>tEXT. JOSHUA TREE CAMPSITE - NIGHT
</b>
tUnder a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around 
ta campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is 
tMarcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves."  She tends to 
ts'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY, 
ther young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small 
tboulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's 
tfinest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to 
tthe boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan 
tPathfinder. Monty's watch goes off.

<b>tttt  MONTY
</b>ttBaby, it's eight o'clock.

tMarcella gets up.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttThanks, Monty.

tShe tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck.

<b>tINT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tMarcella gets in. She shuts the door and dials the phone.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttHey there, how'd it go?

<b>tINT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT - INTERCUT
</b>
tMartin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttIt isn't done.

tMarcella pauses, taking this in.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttThis is not good.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI'll do it tomorrow.

tMarcella considers this.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttWhat's it look like?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttIt's fine.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttYou haven't looked at the dossier.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttt(a little defensive)
ttI've looked at it.

tMartin eyes the vent.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttYou have.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttYes. It's the same as usual. Nothing 
ttremarkable about it at all.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttI have to call the client and give 
ttthem a reason why you're late.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttTell them my house exploded.

tBeat. Marcella doesn't know what to make of this.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttI'll call them and tell them you're 
tttaking your time. Being a 
ttprofessional.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttOkay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if 
ttyou could find out why they double-
ttbooked the job, and who is trying to 
ttkill me, and call me back-- that's 
ttbe great.

<b>tttt  MARCELLA
</b>ttWill do.

tMartin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to 
tget down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his 
tbriefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. 
tHe looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over 
tin his hands, and tosses it on the bed.

<b>tBRIEFCASE
</b>
tWe catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons. Martin picks up the 
tenvelope and is about to tear the seal when

<b>tTHE PHONE RINGS
</b>
tMartin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttt(filtered)
ttAre you there?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttPick me up at my father's house at 
ttaround seven. And don't be late this 
tttime.

tBeat.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttHello...?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttThis night, this reunion will be an 
ttimportant step in our relationship.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttYou're fucking psycho.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttDon't rush to judgement until all 
ttthe facts are in.

tShe hangs up. Martin smiles and replaces the receiver. He 
tturns to the apparatus laid out on the bed.

<b>tGUNS, BULLETS, ETC.
</b>
tWhat has been his life is beginning to look more like death 
tto him. He places the envelope in the case, then returns the 
tcase to its hiding place.

<b>tEXT. DINER - DAY
</b>
tLardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire 
tacross the street.

<b>tttt  MCCULLERS
</b>ttI wish he'd do his job already so we 
ttcould do our job.

<b>tttt  LARDNER
</b>ttWe can't do our job unless he does 
tthis job.

<b>tttt  MCCULLERS
</b>ttWhy don't we just do his job then, 
ttso we can do our job, and get the 
ttfuck out of here.

<b>tttt  LARDNER
</b>ttDo his job? I'm not a cold-blooded 
ttkiller.

<b>tttt  MCCULLERS
</b>ttWait a minute--

<b>tttt  LARDNER
</b>tt-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, 
ttbut not be a Bad Guy, you wait until 
tta Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and 
ttthen you come in and kill the Bad 
ttGuy, and then you're the Good Guy.

<b>tttt  MCCULLERS
</b>ttSo if we do his job, we're the bad 
ttguys. If we do our job, we're the 
ttgood guys.

<b>tttt  LARDNER
</b>ttYup.

tThey both laugh, as if at some great joke. Their laughter is 
tcaught short by the sight of

<b>tLARDNER AND MCCULLERS' POV
</b>
<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttmoving into the diner.

<b>tINT. DINER - LATE MORNING
</b>
tMartin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets 
tinto an apple juice and looking out the window.

<b>tGROCER
</b>
tslides into the booth, across from Martin.

<b>tMARTIN AND GROCER
</b>
tMartin draws a nasty little PPK pistol from his waist, and 
tlevels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already 
tdrawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican 
tbreakfast stand-off.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttEasy, tiger.

tA waitress approaches.

<b>tttt  WAITRESS
</b>ttHi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My 
ttname is Melanie and I'll be your 
ttserver this morning. Let me tell you 
ttabout some of our specials. Today we 
tthave the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our 
ttfeature omelette. And there's our 
tt"Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if 
ttyou're in the mood for something 
ttdifferent there's the "I left my 
ttheart in San Franchezie."

tMartin and Grocer's eyes remain locked.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttI want two eggs poached, hash brown 
ttwell-done. English muffin for the 
ttbread. And a coffee.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWhole-grain pancakes. And an egg-
ttwhite omelette.

<b>tttt  WAITRESS
</b>ttWhat would you like in the omelette?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttNothing in the omelette. Nothing at 
ttall.

tThe waitress nods pertly and leaves.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttt(re: the omelette)
ttCome on, live a little. I'm sorry 
ttabout the incident yesterday.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttNo harm no foul.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttA little misunderstanding among my 
ttassociates.

tBeat.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttI told them to kill you and they 
ttdidn't.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttHard to get good help these days.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttBut since we're both here, I think 
ttit's time to take a fresh look at 
ttour relationship.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI didn't get into this business to 
tthave "associates." And I don't want 
ttto join your Goddamned union. "Loner--
tt" "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my 
ttown." That's the whole point. Why 
ttdon't you become a cop, or something. 
ttYou can drink coffee in the morning... 
ttwith friends!

tGrocer looks a little hurt.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttt(easing up)
ttLook, this is a one-on-one business... 
ttEvery time you get to know people, 
ttbad things happen. If it'll make you 
ttfeel any better, this is my last 
ttjob. So what do you say we put our 
ttguns away and forget the whole damn 
ttthing.

tGrocer loses it.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttFuck you! No scabs! From now on, 
tteverything's regulated!

tLong beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttNo deal.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttFine. But we're not going to let you 
ttdo your job. Because we're gonna do 
ttit. And then, after we do your job, 
ttwe're gonna do another little job...

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttt(Wry)
ttIs that right?

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttYeah-- after I shoot you through the 
ttfucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you 
ttin the bullethole.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttNice talk, Sugarmouth.

<b>tINT. SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tMartin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card. He tosses 
tit aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror. He wears 
ta crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile...

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttt(trying on smile)
ttYes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell 
ttcouch insurance. I test-market 
ttpositive thinking. I lead a weekend 
ttmen's group, actually. We specialize 
ttin ritual killings. I'm hungry, are 
ttyou hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh.
ttt(sarcastic)
ttHi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me?  
ttI'm not married, I have no kids and 
ttI'd blow your brains out if someone 
ttpaid me enough... So how've you been? 
ttWhere do you stand on The Issues? 
ttAre you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, 
ttshamed, blahblahblahblah--

<b>tEXT. DEBI'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
</b>
tMartin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, 
tholding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front 
tsteps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttFlowers. That's funny.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttAs long as I get the laugh.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttt(taking them)
ttHere. Let me put these in some rubbing

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttYou look beautiful.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttOkay... Hold on...

<b>tMARTIN'S P.O.V.
</b>
tthrough a doorway leading into a den. All that's visible of 
tMR. NEWBERRY, Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a 
tBarcolounger.

<b>tttt  DEBI (V.O.)
</b>tt...Let me get my coat.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI'll just help myself to a cocktail.

</b>
tmoves up the stairs and disappears.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tlooks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the 
tden.

<b>tINT. DEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tMr. Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel. 
tHe is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of 
thair. He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to 
tMartin.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttGood evening, Mr. Newberry.

<b>tttt  MR. NEWBERRY
</b>ttGood evening, Mr. Blank.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttHow are you? How's business?

<b>tttt  MR. NEWBERRY
</b>ttMartin, I don't know where you've 
ttbeen since you abandoned my daughter 
ttten years ago, and I don't care. It 
ttwas good that you left, and I'm glad 
ttyou did. So what do you want to talk 
ttabout? You've grown up a bit. Maybe 
ttI had you figured wrong.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttHow's that?

<b>tttt  MR. NEWBERRY
</b>ttI visualized you, in a haze, as one 
ttof the slackster, flannel-wearing, 
ttcoffeehouse-misanthropes I've been 
ttseeing in Newsweek.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI took the other road. I'm more of a 
ttself-reflective young lion who does 
ttbusiness with lead-pipe cruelty and 
ttgoes home to drink light beer in 
ttmilky-eyes isolation. I love sports 
ttand sex and have no real relationships 
ttwith anyone. And you?

<b>tttt  MR. NEWBERRY
</b>ttOh, you know me, Martin. I'm the 
ttsame old sell-out baby-boomer, 
ttexploiting the oppressed I got shot 
ttfor at Kent State. But why don't we 
tthave a drink and forget the whole 
ttthing?

tNewberry lays down his book, and moves behind the wet bar.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWhy not?

<b>tttt  MR. NEWBERRY
</b>ttSo what are you doing with your life 
ttnow, son?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI'm a professional killer.

<b>tttt  MR. NEWBERRY
</b>ttThat's good.

tDebi's footsteps are heard coming down the stairs.

tMr. Newberry watches Martin turn and walk out of the room.

</b>
tMartin and Debi pull away from the curb.

<b>tINT. CAR - DUSK
</b>
tMartin and Debi drive through that to Debi is town, and to 
tMartin is a widening pool of quicksand.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttDo you want to get a drink first?

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttI think they'll probably have booze 
ttthere.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttRight.

tMartin's right hand shakes off of the wheel a bit. He grips 
tit tighter. Suddenly, Martin turns the wheel and pulls into 
ta gas station parking lot, halting next to a pay phone.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI'll just be a second.

tDebi nods, a little confused but going with it.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttOkay...

tMartin stands at the kiosk next to the Town Car, mid-
tconversation.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttt(defensive)
tt...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but 
ttsomeone tried to kill me and the guy 
ttin the middle got killed. So if I

<b>tttt  DR. OATMAN
</b>ttOkay. Repeat this after me.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttOut Loud?

tMartin looks to Debi. She looks up and smiles. We hear Dr.

ttI love. I kill.

<b>tMARTIN AND DEBI
</b>
tclimb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping 
this sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm 
thimself. Eighties music echoes from the gym.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttt(to himself)
ttShoulda brought my gun.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttWhat?

tHe pulls himself off the car and heads toward

<b>tGROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL
</b>
tA sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It 
tis topped by church-like towers. It's scary.

<b>tINT. GYM - NIGHT
</b>
tMartin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. 
tA benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above. Basketball 
tnets are swung back, draped with crepe. Lights are half-low 
tand the music is loud. Alumni are dancing.

<b>tttt  ARLENE
</b>ttWelcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott-
ttJoseph.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI'm Martin Blank.

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttDebi Newberry.

tDebi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands 
tMartin. Arlene rises from a card table. They have little to 
tsay. Martin wasn't part of her crowd.

<b>tttt  ARLENE
</b>ttMarty, you haven't changed a bit!

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttDon't say that.

tArlene gives him a NAMETAG. As a special torture, the tags 
thave YEARBOOK PHOTOS. Martin looks at the name tag 
tuncomfortably.

<b>tttt  ARLENE
</b>ttWe had pictures put on, that way 
tteverybody knows who everybody was!

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWonderful.

<b>tttt  ARLENE
</b>ttSo, what are you doing now?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWhatever I can get away with.

tShe smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the 
tnext arrival. Martin moves off...

<b>tttt  ARLENE
</b>ttt(to the next person)
ttIsn't it cute. It's so everybody 
ttknows who everybody was!

tHe circles the crowded gym. Looking for familiar faces. He 
tstops at the open bar.

<b>tttt  BATENDER
</b>ttWhat can I make you?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttBeer.

tThe bartender gets him a beer. Martin recognizes a guy at 
tthe bar. He is well-appointed and shiny. He is KEN ALDRIDGE.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttHey, Ken. How have you been?

<b>tttt  KEN
</b>ttt(glancing at Martin's 
tttname tag)
ttHello Martin. How have you been?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttNot bad. You?

tBob Destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink. Eye 
tcontact is made.

<b>tttt  KEN
</b>ttHello, Bob.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttHey, Bob.

tBob turns slightly toward them. They continue in their 
tconversation.

<b>tttt  KEN
</b>ttI'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice 
tt& Fromeyer.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttThat sounds pretty interesting...

tBob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how.

<b>tttt  KEN
</b>ttSometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. 
ttSome property. Some personal injury.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttThose all seem kind of related...

tBob takes another drink and mopes off, Martin watches him 
tgo.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttTragedy makes you thirsty.

tKen chuckles. The bartender arrives with the bottle. Martin 
tgrabs it and begins to move off.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWell... I have to take this over to 
ttDebi.

<b>tttt  KEN
</b>ttHere. Take my card. Wait a minute... 
tthere's a special one. For top-shelf 
ttclients.

tKen hands Martin a Monte Blanc pen with Ken's title and 
tbusiness address printed on the shaft. Martin reads it and 
tputs it in his kerchief pocket.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttThanks.

tKen goes back to listening to the Guys at the bar.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tmakes his way through the upbeat crowd of well-wishers. TERRY 
temerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts 
tMartin. His angst is barely under control as he sidles up to 
tMartin.

<b>tttt  TERRY
</b>ttI don't know, Blank, all these fucking 
ttpeople, driving me crazy. Look at 
ttthem over there, memorializing old 
tttimes, acting all like it was 
ttsomething "life-changing." And the 
ttpeople in the National Honor Society? 
ttThe name tags?

tMartin shrugs.

<b>tttt  TERRY
</b>ttThey have special blue starts on 
ttthem like it fucking matters now 
ttthat they were in the honor club ten 
ttyears ago. I'm getting fucking 
ttnauseous from all this sentimental

tTerry stops suddenly as if he's finished. Martin reads this 
tman's nametag.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWhy are you here... Terry?

tTerry turns on a dime.

<b>tttt  TERRY
</b>ttI wanted to see a couple people. But 
ttI don't want to talk about the old 
ttdays... What did we have together, 
ttMartin? Typing?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttt(remembering)

</b>ttDon't mention it.

tTerry slinks off.

<b>tBAR - SAME

tBob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns 
tto leave, thoroughly morose. In his path, he finds DAN 
tKORETZKY, the good-looking side of brainy.

<b>tttt  DAN
</b>ttBob. Bob Destephano.

<b>tttt  BOB
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttt  DAN
</b>ttI'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

tDebi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others 
tin an area blocked off for dinner. Plates of gumbo are 
tarriving and the wine is poured. DARIUS, an African-American, 
tis in mid-conversation with AMY, who looks like she walked 
tout of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of 
tMartin. DENNIS and MIKE are two suits in the midst of a non-
tstop sports conversation.

<b>tttt  MIKE
</b>tt...You gotta hold the fans 
ttresponsible, though, Dennis, because 
ttthey're the ones putting up with the 
ttmediocre product.

<b>tttt  DENNIS
</b>ttI guess, though, you know, if you 
ttlook at it Mike, that park is a 
ttbeautiful park, I've gone to that 
ttpark many times - I've had the 
ttgreatest time of my life at that

ttI mow down insurance claims at Aetna--

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttWe haven't seen each other since

</b>ttI figured. You two look too happy 
tttogether. I shouldn't say that though, 
ttI'm married... So, Martin-- what are 
ttyou up to these days? What do you do 
ttfor a living?

tDebi perks up; this should be interesting.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI'm in pro-active international 
ttrelations. It's a very specialized 
ttcompany. We execute economic 
ttinvestment opportunities. Sort of 
tteconomic clean-up... with an emphasis 
tton personnel. It's boring, you know, 
ttit's boring. I don't like to talk 
ttabout it because I don't think what 
tta man does necessarily reflects who 
tthe is...

tMartin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. 
tMartin may be in trouble.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>tt...I've always tried to refrain from 
tta black-and-white moral lexicon--you 
ttknow, good, bad, right, wrong--I've 
ttbeen more interested in the gray

tSilence. Martin pushes on.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttBut that's no way to live. I guess

ttit.

<b>tttt  DARIUS
</b>ttSounds complicated, Martin. Are you

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI just have to close this one last

<b>tttt  DEBI
</b>ttI don't know, Martin. It sounds like 
ttyou're feeling compromised. Live the 
ttway you want. The only thing that's 
ttinexcusable, to me, is cynicism. 
ttThat's the biggest cop-out there is.

tNods of assent come from around the table. A brief silence, 
tand then...

<b>tttt  AMY
</b>ttBut wait. I still don't understand 
ttwhat you do.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

tDebi suppresses a laugh.

</b>ttYou do not.

</b>ttYes I do.

</b>ttYou don't...

tAcross the table from Martin and Debi, Dennis turns to Darius.

<b>tttt  DENNIS
</b>ttWhat do you think about black coaching 
ttin the NFL, Darius? Because I think 
ttit's great.

<b>tttt  DARIUS
</b>ttI don't pay much attention to 
ttfootball.

<b>tttt  MIKE
</b>ttI have to agree with you Dennis. 
ttIt's good to see that the owners are 
ttwilling to put the franchise behind 
tta black head coach or QB when for 
ttyears in the league they've been 
ttkept out of the thinking positions 
ttand relegated mainly to the physical 
ttgame.

<b>tttt  DENNIS
</b>ttBut now, you see, you have Warren

</b>
tMartin and Debi come out of the Nurse's Office. The post-

tYou Want Me, Baby?"  blasting from the gym. Martin and Debi 
ttune in on the song for a moment, unhappy at remembering 
tthat particular moment in pop music history. Debi looks to 
tMartin, something must be done about it.

</b>ttI'll be right back....

ta long, complicated, and forgotten play. Martin approaches 
tfrom behind Bob and glides through the ad-hoc line-up, 
tcontinuing down the hall. Bob yells "hike" as he stares after 
tMartin, distracted. Bob's rushed upon and sacked. He lets 
tthe papier-mache ball drop and crack on the floor.

<b>tINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER
</b>
tMartin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and 
tclassroom doors. The only sounds are his footsteps and the 
techoed strains of Iggy Pop's "Wild Child" from the distant 
tgym. He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right-
tback left-right again. It opens. He pops up the steel false 
tceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, 
tand withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint. He 
tholds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer. He 
tgrinds it into dust in his hand.

tMartin senses he is not alone. He turns to find Bob 
tDestephano. The big man holds a glass unsteadily and slurs 
tslightly when he speaks. Bob is looking sad and scary. He 
tleans into Martin

</b>ttSo. You and Debi. Gonna hit that

ttresolution between us? We don't exist. 
ttThere's nothing between us. So who 
ttdo you want to hit, Bob? It's not

tthen stops abruptly, and smiles.

tbut does not break stride. Debi gives him wide berth, and 
tquickens her pace up the stairs...

<b>tINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

tMartin watches the doors swing to a stop. He exhales and 
trelaxes... AND THEN Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a BURST 
tfrom a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was 
ta split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand 
twithdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops 
tthe cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of 
this attacker--

timpaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back.

<b>tMARTIN AND FELIX
</b>
tare frozen for a moment. Blood runs quickly down the front 
tof Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor. The 
tstairwell doors band open. Martin's head turns toward the 
tsound. His eyes lock onto

</b>
<b>tMARTIN
</b>
trips it down from the wall with his free hand, wraps it around 
tFelix, stuffs the body into his open locker, and slams it 
tshut. He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over

tHe stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the 
thall, and bangs through the doors.

tHe cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. 
tHe freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves 
ttoward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and 
tbody slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything 
tgone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the 
tdoor and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet...

</b>ttI was, but no... yes... I was before,

tMarcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear, 
tand holds a two-gallon gas can. She moves from room to room 
tpouring gasoline onto the computers, desks, and piles of

t"Women Who Run With the Wolves."

tMartin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's. In the

taway from him.

</b>
tGrocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching

tMartin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking. As 
tthe distance between them turns from yards to feet... Martin 
tswerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next 
tto him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire. After a moment, 
tNewberry opens the passenger door.

</b>ttWhat the fuck is the matter with

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttWell, I was hired to kill you. It's 
ttwhat I do, and come to think of it, 
ttI told you that, but... Okay. I'm

tMartin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out 
tand head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is 
tshaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element.

<b>tttt  NEWBERRY
</b>ttWhy? I build cars! They're paying 
ttyou to kill me? Why?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttIt was a cost-cutting effort. They

ttYou want to kill me because of that?

</b>ttWe'll go in through the woods.

<b>tINT. NEWBERRY HOUSE
</b>
tMartin's briefcase is open on the large oak table. The 
tcontents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table. 
tNewberry and Debi watch him, dumbstruck, as he draws a huge 
tDesert Eagle automatic and jerks back the slide. He turns to 
tDebi.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI was sitting in my house on prom 
ttnight wearing that Goddamned rented 
tttuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a 
ttbottle of champagne in the other. So 
ttI was just sitting there, and then 
ttthe whole night flashed before my 
tteyes, and it struck me like a bullet 
ttin the head-- I realized, finally, 
ttand for the first time, that... I 
ttwanted to kill somebody. So I figured 
ttbecause I loved you so much, that'd 
ttit'd be a good idea if I didn't see 
ttyou anymore. But now I'm different.

tHe turns and points the gun at the front door and FIRES two 
tshots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the 
tdoor.

tMartin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house. 
tDebi and Newberry run as fast as they can away from Martin. 
tNewberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with 
tDebi. They stop at what they see:

<b>tNEWBERRY'S & DEBI'S P.O.V.
</b>
tAs ASSASSIN lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by 
tMartin. IN one hand is a gun, in the other is a Fuller Brush 
tkit. Two men, GROCER and an ASSASSIN, clamber out of van, 
ttheir guns rising up fast toward us.

tDebi pulls Newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks 
tit. They dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from 
toutside.

<b>tINT. KITCHEN - SAME
</b>
tMartin rushes toward the back door which is already opening. 
tA barrel comes through and FIRES at Martin. Martin pulls 
tback behind the refrigerator and returns FIRE. An ASSASSIN 
tcomes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind 
tthe cooking island. Martin, yelling back to Debi...

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI'm in love with you. I know we can 
ttmake this work!

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
trushes toward the island, grabbing an iron skillet off the 
trange, and holds it up like a crossing-guard stop sign. He 
tsteps toward the hidden Assassin just as the Assassin rises 
tSHOOTING. The skillet takes two rounds before Martin hammers 
tthe Assassin's head with it. Debi and Newberry arrive in the 
tkitchen.

<b>tNEW ANGLE - LOW DUTCH
</b>
tMartin bashes the skillet into the Assassin's skull, which 
tis beyond our view. He rises spattered with blood and looks 
tat Debi.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI was afraid to commit to a 
ttrelationship, but now I know I'm 
ttready to make it happen.

tMartin drops the skillet and grabs Newberry and Debi gently 
tbe the wrists.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI just need time to change.

tHe ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back 
tstairs. He spins and FIRES twice back down the stairs at 
tanother ASSASSIN coming up, blowing his arms off.

<b>tHALLWAY
</b>
tHe leads them quickly.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttIt's not easy for me. I was raised 
ttto close off, to control my 
ttfeelings...

tHe takes them into a bedroom, and BLOWS AWAY, an ASSASSIN 
tcoming in through the window, emptying his auto. Martin pushes 
tDebi and Newberry into an adjoining bathroom. He backs out 
tthrough the doorway.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttLock the door.

tThey do. Martin starts away, but stops to get something 
tstraight.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI wasn't raised in a loving 
ttenvironment.
ttt(beat)
ttBut that's not an excuse. It's a 
ttreason.

</b>
tMartin corners the banister and springs half-way down the 
tstairs, then hears the front door begin to open.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttMy soul was empty--

tMartin jams in another clip, and chambers a round. He sees 
tGrocer beginning to slip in.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>tt--and it's up to me to fill it.

tMartin FIRES the twelve-round clip into the door until the 
tslide locks back empty again. Grocer backs out fast. Martin 
thears a gun REPORT from upstairs and moves back toward it, 
ttossing the spent weapon.

<b>tINT. BEDROOM
</b>
tAn ASSASSIN slams his body against the bathroom door while 
tDebi and Newberry scream from within. Martin flies at him. 
tThe Assassin wheels on Martin FIRING. Martin pivots out of 
tthe line of fire, still moving forward. He takes hold of 
tAssassin's neck and snaps it. Martin drops the corpse.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttt(through the door)
ttIt's okay. It's Martin The door begins 
ttto open revealing Debi and Newberry.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttI know what I do isn't moral, per 
ttse, but if you could just look past 
ttthat, you'd see a man worth loving.

<b>tttt  GROCER (O.S.)
</b>ttDon't listen to him, he's a

tMartin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled 
tvoice coming from the vent. Grocer continues...

<b>tttt  GROCER (O.S.)
</b>ttYou're breaking my heart down here, 
ttBlank. I can't shoot through the 
tttears.

tMartin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead 
tman. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze 
tfirefight...

<b>tEXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

tLardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, 
tabout to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window.

treaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading 
tup the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to 
tFIRE, when they hear...

<b>tLARDNER AND MCCULLERS
</b>
tpower through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, 
tala Butch and Sundance.

tMartin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and 
tFIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls 
tout of view.

</b>
tworks his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the 
tkitchen.

<b>tGROCER
</b>
thears him and starts back down.

tMartin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes 
tout of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as 
tGrocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, 
tcrouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the 
tair toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining 
troom, still firing.

tFlying through the air disappearing through the shuttered 
tserving window, his flight carrying him past a television 
tthat sits on a lazy susan.

<b>tMARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT

tMartin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite 
tside of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in 
tthe dining room. The hulking old television sits on the 
tcounter above and between them.

tMartin looks up and spies the TELEVISION

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>tt...How about I sell you two rounds 
ttfor a hundred grand a piece?

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttOkay.

tMartin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it 
tinto a loose ball and tosses it over the counter.

tsails over the television and comes down, bouncing off 
tGrocer's head and into his lap.

<b>tttt  MARTIN
</b>ttThere you go. I left it blank.

<b>tttt  GROCER
</b>ttExcellent. Here they come.

tGrocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi-automatic 
tand pushes the clip back into the gun. Grocer arcs the TWO 
tBULLETS into the air.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
trises and springs at the television, gripping it. The TWO 
tBULLETS sail past his head.

<b>tGROCER
</b>
tbegins to rise from his side of the counter, cocking his 
tgun.

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tputs all his weight and motion behind the television. Martin 
tand the television careen off of the counter toward Grocer.

<b>tGROCER
</b>
tgets off one round before

<b>tMARTIN
</b>
tflies onto Grocer, smashing the seventy-five pound television 
tover his Goddamn head. Martin sails past the collision, 
tlanding on his back in the dining room. He rolls over to see

<b>tGROCER
</b>
tBody crumpled, neck is snapped, head encased in the shattered 
tpicture tube. He is dead.

</b>
truns up the front stairs, retrieving the spent gun he 
tdiscarded earlier, and heads into the bedroom.

tMartin opens the bathroom door. Inside, Debi sits on the 
tedge of the tub, her face in her hands. Newberry kneels with 
this arms around her. Martin takes this in, and walks back 
tinto the bedroom. Newberry stands and follows him out.

tMARTIN a bloody, tattered mess, wipes off the gun and puts 
tit into Newberry's hand. Newberry, in total shock, grips it. 
tMartin looks past Newberry.

tOf Debi, head in hands.
