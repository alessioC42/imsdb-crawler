<b>t
</b><b>tINT LARGE, DARK ROOM NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the ebony shadows of a large room we can make out corners and edges, 
tmoldings and cornices; the phantoms of decaying Victorian wealth 
tfloating like disembodied ghosts in the darkness.
<b>t
</b>tIt is May 6, 1924 The harsh flare of a match being struck
<b>t
</b>tA shadowy male figure lights a series of nine candles on a birthday 
tcake. Beyond the cake we can see a bed.
<b>t
</b>tOn the bed lies a woman in her early forties. She is ashen and sickly. 
tDying.
<b>t
</b>tThe shadowy male figure finishes lighting the candles, blows out the 
tmatch and disappears as the woman peers into the darkness.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         WOMAN 
</b>t          Come into the light.. Come into the light
<b>t
</b>tA nine-year-old boy steps into the light.
<b>t
</b>tShe pulls him close and whispers:
<b>t                         WOMAN 
</b><b>t
</b>tNever stand in the shadows --
<b>t
</b><b>t                         BOY 
</b>t          Mother...
<b>t
</b><b>t                         WOMAN 
</b>t          You are made for the light, Orson Now you must blow 
t          out your candles. But you must always remember, the 
t          cake itself is nothing. The flame, the lights, that 
t          is where your future lies. You must have a dream. A 
t          great dream worthy of you.
<b>t
</b>tThe boy immediately spins to the cake and blows out the candles. A 
tmoment of darkness. He turns back to the bed. The woman and the bed are 
tgone, faded into darkness.
<b>t
</b>tThe solemn young lad stares and stares into the darkness
<b>t
</b>tAnd then, magically, the faint glimmer of twinkling stars fill his huge 
tdark eyes.
<b>t
</b>tNEWSREEL The flickering images of an old newsreel, circa 1940
<b>t
</b>tUnder the MGM logo we see the title: BOY WONDER WOWS HOLLYWOOD!
<b>t
</b>tThe first image after the title is the imposing figure of ORSON WELLES, 

tclimbing down from an airplane and surveying the world at his feet.
<b>t
</b>tWelles is 24 years old and somewhat handsome. Welles seems rather 
tuncomfortable in his own body, as if it could not possibly contain his 
tvast passions and appetites.
<b>t
</b>tOrson Welles is man who tears his way through life with incendiary 
tenergy. He is at once inspiring and ferocious; visionary and coldly 
tambitious. He is part artist, part fraud and all showman.
<b>t
</b>tA sonorous voice accompanies the newsreel. The voice is always grand, 
toccasionally sardonic.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          He came to the town of magic and dreams a flashing 
t          star blazing through the firmament of illusion. And 
t          he promised to devour the world in a single gulp. He 
t          was 24 years old and his name was George Orson 
t          Welles. Sound the trumpets! Unfurl the banners, 
t          Hollywood! The Boy Wonder has arrived!
<b>t
</b>tImages of Welles as a baby and his early life fill the screen: Welles 
tin a crib; as a pampered schoolboy; at dance class; drama club; dressed 
tup for a magic show. As we hear:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          He made his debut on the world stage in Kenosha, 
t          Wisconsin, on the 6th of May, 1915. And on the 7th 
t          of May he spoke his first words, and unlike other 
t          children who say commonplace things like "momma" and 
t          "poppa", he proclaimed "I am a genius!"
<b>t
</b>tAt three the genius was reciting Shakespeare and at eight he had taken 
tup cigars and highballs and was learning magic from the  knee of the 
tgreat Houdini.
<b>t
</b>tImages of Welles' early theatrical career: the young man playing 
timpossibly old parts; vaudeville magic shows; various regional 
ttheaters; endless tawdry rehearsal rooms
<b>t
</b>tThen images of Welles and JOHN HOUSEMAN in New York: the great, 
tbustling city; Welles at work with John Houseman on a script; Welles 
tdirecting a play. As we hear:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          So how could the magic of the stage not call to 
t          this adventurous lad? Unstoppable and resolute, the 
t          Boy Wonder journeyed into the world of the legit 
t          theater. After a peripatetic beginning he found 
t          himself at last in New York where he joined forces 
t          with theatrical producer John Houseman under the 
t          august auspices of the WPA Federal Theater.
<b>t
</b>tA rehearsal room interview with John Houseman, who is in his 30's, 
tthin-lipped and prim:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         HOUSEMAN 
</b>t          Orson barreled in and took over. Orson's a real 
t          barreler.
<b>t
</b>tImages of Welles directing his famous "Fascist JULIUS CAESAR" and 
t"Voodoo MACBETH" productions: auditions; rehearsals; perfecting a 
tsword-fight; rejecting classical costume sketches for JULIUS CAESAR; 
tsupervising set construction; performing Brutus in the Albert Speer-
tlike Nuremberg rally lighting of JULIUS CAESAR. As we hear:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          Like Hannibal over the Alps, the Boy Genius invaded 
t          the Great White Way. He stunned the sedate elite of 
t          New York theatre with production after production. 
t          From MACBETH with an entirely colored cast to a 
t          Mussolini-inspired JULIUS CAESAR!
<b>t
</b>tMore images of New York, Welles, Houseman and radio: Welles directing a 
tradio play with sweeping energy; supervising the elaborate sound 
teffects; editing the script; at odds with Houseman. As we hear:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          Though he wowed the critics with his spectaculars 
t          the ticket sales left something to be desired. So, 
t          after founding the Mercury Players with Houseman, 
t          young Mr. Welles quickly set his sights on the 
t          airwaves. He quickly became the sonorous -' voice of 
t          "The Shadow." ''
<b>t
</b>tNewsreel footage of Welles at a standing radio microphone;
<b>t
</b><b>t                         WELLES 
</b>t          Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The 
t          Shadow knows. . .
<b>t
</b>tWelles laughs his sinister Shadow laugh and we go to more images of 
tradio and the dynamic Welles performing and directing as we hear:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          With Lament Cranston in one pocket and his own 
t          radio show. The Mercury Theater of the Air, our Boy 
t          Wonder filled the night with his resounding tones. 
t          And on October 30th of 1938, he became what he felt 
t          destined to be: a household name.
<b>t
</b>tWhat started out as a roguish Halloween prank became the most famous 
tradio show in the history of the galaxy!
<b>t
</b>tImages of the WAR OF THE WORLDS broadcast and panic: listeners huddling 
tnext to their radios; telephone switchboards lighting up; New Jersey 
tState Motorcycle Troopers zooming down rural roads; cars clogging the 
thighways. As we hear:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          THE WAR OF THE WORLDS sent this nation spinning 
t          into a frenzy. Nine million listeners clasped their 
t          loved ones close and looked to the skies with 
t          horror. Unlucky listeners near the epicenter of the 
t          "invasion" -- rural New Jersey -- ran screaming into 
t          the night, sure a monstrous alien and a fiery death 
t          awaited them around every corner! The mischievous 
t          Boy Wonder had fooled us all!
<b>t
</b>tNewsreel footage of a packed press conference with Welles the day 
tfollowing the broadcast:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         WELLES 
</b>t             (contritely)
t           Of course ... of course ... if I had known the 
t          panic the broadcast was causing -- well I would have 
t          stopped! I never meant for any of this to happen and 
t          I feel just horrible!
<b>t
</b>tQuick newsreel clips of Welles leaving the press conference with 
tHouseman. We see them slip into a taxi. Inside the taxi we can just 
tglimpse Welles exploding with laughter.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          How long, oh how long could it possibly be before 
t          the sunny land of dreams tried to harness the 
t          combustible power of this showman, this impresario, 
t          this best of all possible Boy Wonders?!
<b>t
</b>tImages of Welles posing and shaking hands with GEORGE                          
<b>SCHAEFER
</b><b>t
</b>tSchaefer is an intense, compact man in his early 50's. His nickname in 
tHollywood is "The Tiger" -- both for his admired tenacity and his 
tfeared temper. He is a moral and ethical man; John Adams in a Brooks 
tBrothers suit.
<b>t
</b>tAs we hear
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          The winner in the Welles derby was George Schaefer, 
t          the head of RKO Pictures. With a contract 
t          unimaginable before The Days Of Orson, Mr. Schaefer 
t          captured the whirlwind snared the beast, roped the 
t          tyrant!
<b>t
</b>tImages of Welles and Schaefer: Welles signing his contract; smiling to 
tSchaefer; Schaefer making a speech; Welles joking with reporters. As we 
thear:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          Eyebrows raised and jaws dropped all over 
t          Hollywoodland when the terms of the deal that lured 
t          The Great Orson came forth: the Boy Wonder could 
t          produce, write, direct and star in his own projects 
t          with budgets up to $500,000 a picture! He would have 
t          total control over the shooting of the picture and 
t          the finished product. The studio, well, they just 
t          paid the bills. Meanwhile, the insiders of filmland 
t          were skeptical.
<b>t
</b>tAn interview with a Hollywood Insider, who looks like a bookie:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         HOLLYWOOD INSIDER 
</b>t          John Ford doesn't have a deal like that. Cecil B. 
t          DeMille doesn't have a deal like that. No one has a 
t          deal like that! If ya ask me, George Schaefer is 
t          just plain nuts
<b>t
</b>tImages of Welles arriving in Hollywood and touring the town: Welles 
tclimbing down from a plane; posing with Schaefer before of the RKO 
tgates; touring the studio; leaning over an editing machine; laughing 
twith female extras in the commissary; posing in front of his Brentwood 
thome. As we hear:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          So Cometh Orson! He toured the RKO studio and met 
t          with the biggest of the big! He charmed his way 
t          through the town from the Brown Derby to the 
t          Copacabana, from the Pacific Palisades to the 
t          Hollywood Hills!
<b>t
</b>tMore images of Welles in Hollywood: Welles touring the town; visiting 
tall the nightclubs and dancing with beautiful women; he is seen 
teverywhere about the town. As we hear:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          Yes, the Boy Wonder had arrived! He even charmed 
t          those rival maidens of Hollywood gossip, those well-
t          coiffured chroniclers of the dream factory: Hedda 
t          Hopper and Louella Parsons.
<b>t
</b>tShots of Welles with LOUELLA PARSONS and HEDDA HOPPER
<b>t
</b>tLouella is a much-feared gossip columnist. She is a gorgon in her 60's; 
tMargaret Dumont possessed by the devil and tanked up on gin. Her 
tcapricious cruelty is only matched by her fervent loyalty to all things 
tHearstian.
<b>t
</b>tHedda is a gossip columnist in her 50's. She is given to elaborate hats 
tand villainous intrigue. Louella's younger, smarter rival, Hedda 
tprobably spends her spare time eating children.
<b>t
</b>tThen a snippet of an interview with Louella:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         LOUELLA 
</b>t          Orson is the sweetest boy. We're both from the 
t          midwest, you know. He's just a local fella making 
t          good, ya follow?
<b>t
</b>tMore shots of Welles just after his arrival in Hollywood, blissfully 
ttouring the RKO facilities as:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>t          So today, almost a year after his arrival in 
t          Hollywood, we leave the Boy Wonder still hard at 
t          work developing his much-anticipated first feature, 
t          preparing to dazzle us all again. We're waiting, 
t          Orson!
<b>t
</b>tWelles after his RKO tour, smiling mischievously, stands before a 
tmicrophone:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         WELLES 
</b>t          I'll tell you what, this is the best electric train 
t          set a boy ever had!
<b>t
</b>t"The End" and newsreel credits
<b>t
</b>tThe newsreel sputters to a stop in a screening room. A shaft of light 
tshines on a large MGM logo on one wall. Another shaft of light 
tilluminates the sitting figure of LOUIS B. MAYER.
<b>t
</b>tMayer is a short, crafty, bespectacled man in his 50's. His cloying, 
tavuncular exterior only fleetingly disguises the film titan's 
toutrageous barbarism.
<b>t
</b>tAnother shadowy figure, a Mayer FLUNKIE, can be just glimpsed sitting 
telsewhere in the screening room.
<b>t
</b>tMayer glowers at the darkened screen for a moment.
<b>t
</b>tA beat.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         MAYER 
</b>t          Who does that cocksucker think he is?
<b>t
</b><b>t                         FLUNKIE 
</b>t          They're laying bets over on the RKO 
t          lot that this great deal will end up 
t          with him never doing a picture. Back 
t          to New York he goes.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         MAYER 
</b>t          Serves him right. I mean can you stomach the 
t          arrogance?
<b>t
</b><b>t                         FLUNKIE 
</b>t          Inside skinny says the glory boy's finished, 
t          can't come up with a movie. Wants to do a biography now.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         MAYER 
</b>t          After RKO boots him maybe we'll pick him up cheap. 
t          Have him do that WAR OF THE WORLDS crap as a 
t          feature.
<b>t
</b>tMeantime, shelve the newsreel. No one cares
<b>t
</b><b>tINT SAN SIMEON. WELLES' SUITE EVENING
</b><b>t
</b>tOrson Welles, elegant and impressive, is flourishing a cigarette and a 
tcoin in his magnificently expressive hands He is perfecting a magic 
ttrick.
<b>t
</b>tWelles is lounging on the bed of an enormous guest suite at San Simeon. 
tHe is wearing a tuxedo.
<b>t
</b>tIn the bathroom beyond him we can see the writer HERMAN MANKIEWICZ 
<b>t("MANK". )
</b><b>t
</b>tMank is a wonderful wreck of a human being. 43 years old, but looking 
tconsiderably older, he is short and squat and bitter. A compulsive 
tgambler and drinker, Mank still glimmers with wry humor that is equally 
twicked and corrosive. He is incomplete without the stub of a cigar 
tclenched in his teeth.
<b>t
</b>tMank, also dressed in a tuxedo, is looking at himself in the bathroom 
tmirror as he struggles with his bow tie. He occasionally glances in the 
tmirror to Welles.
<b>t
</b>tTitle: JANUARY 3, 1940

</b>t          I don't know what you expected with Joseph-

<b>t
</b><b>t                         WELLES 
</b>t          All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer

<b>t
</b><b>t                         MANK

<b>t
</b><b>t                         WELLES
</b>t          Nonsense
<b>t
</b>tWelles dramatically taps the cigarette on the coin, practicing his 
ttrick as:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         MANK 
</b>t          What are movies about, Orson?
<b>t

t          death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. 
t          They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
<b>t
</b>tWelles quickly makes the cigarette seem to completely pass through the 
tcoin. An astounding bit of slight of hand.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         WELLES

<b>t

</b>
tWelles and Mank walk through an impressive upstairs hallway of San 
tSimeon. Quick glimpses of the astounding grandeur everywhere around 
tthem as:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         WELLES 
</b>t          How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
<b>t

<b>t

</b>tThey disappear down a long stairway 
<b>t
</b><b>tINT SAN SIMEON. DINING HALL EVENING 
</b><b>t
</b>tAn explosion of color and an immediate swirl of sound

<b>t
</b>tWe are in the Grand Refectory -- the mammoth dining room -- at San 
tSimeon. Five long tables are placed end to end. There are about fifty 
tsumptuously dressed guests.
<b>t
</b>tWILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST and MARION DAVIES preside, side by side, 
at the 
tcenter table.
<b>t
</b>tHearst is 76 years old. He is a fully commanding figure, towering in 
tboth height (six foot two) and personality. He is shaped rather like a 
tpear and moves with a delicacy surprising for such a famously merciless 
tman. Although the word ruthless does not begin to do justice to the 
tpress baron's animus, Hearst is endlessly polite and almost painfully 
tsoft-spoken.
<b>t
</b>tMarion is 43 years old, a shimmering and lively presence. In a word 
tthat might have been coined for her, she has moxie. While the ravages 
tof alcoholism have left their subtle marks on the edges and attitudes 
tof her face, she can still charm and captivate with almost effortless 
tgrace.
<b>t
</b>tAround Hearst's feet sit a collection of his beloved dachshunds.
<b>t
</b>tOn the other side of the main table, and down a bit, sit Welles and 
tMank.
<b>t
</b>tWe sweep around the table, hearing bits of overlapping dialogue and 
tfinally settle on Marion and Hearst.
<b>t
</b>tMarion is charming CAROLE LOMBARD and CLARK GABLE, who sit beside 
her. 
tShe tenderly rests one hand on Hearst's arm as she speaks. Marion 
tspeaks with an occasionally pronounced stutter.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         MARION 
</b>t          And we would hear them scuttling around at night 
t          with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t-
t          teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all 
t          over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. 
t          And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung 
t          but no mice!
<b>t
</b><b>t                         CAROLE LOMBARD
</b>t          Houdini mice.
<b>t
</b>tLaughter
<b>t
</b><b>t                         MARION 
</b>t          Just wait. So one night I notice Pops getting outta 
t          bed and sneaking away. And he's got this little p-p-
t          paper bag with him, right? Middle of the night. So I 
t          figure the old man's really up to no good this time 
t          and I follow him. Well I'll be g-g-goddamned if he's 
t          not springing all the traps and leaving cheese for 
t          the rats!
<b>t
</b><b>t                         MARION 
</b>t          You and that freak Disney, in love with the damn 
t          rats!
<b>t
</b>tLaughter, even from Hearst
<b>t
</b><b>t                         HEARST 
</b>t          They really are sweet little things
<b>t
</b>tMeanwhile, across the table Welles is rapaciously devouring his dinner 
tas:

</b>t          Last week would this be?
<b>t

tlistens to his tale:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         WELLES 
</b>t          My father and I made a tour of the grand boulevards 
t          of antique Europe. And when we were in Iberia I had 
t          the chance to face the bulls. At the knee of the 
t          great Manolete I took up the cape and sword - 
t             (he uses his napkin and knife to 
t             demonstrate)
t           -- across from me stood a mammoth bull reputed to 
t          have gored a full seven men to a grisly demise! So -
t          - with Manolete shouting encouragement I flourished 
t          . . . I flourished again . . . and the bull charged! 
t          Across the golden dust it came, thundering like the 
t          great minotaur of legend, closer, ever closer, its 
t          calamitous hooves pounding into the dirt, shaking 
t          the earth as I held the crimson eye of the bull with 
t          my own, defying it -- it was almost upon me and I 
t          flourished one last time! -- the monster swept past! 
<b>t          - 
</b>t             (he spins his napkin in the air and his 
t             knife is now gone, a magic trick)
t           -- and my sword was gone -- buried in the bloody 
t          eye of the beast!
<b>t
</b>tApplause and laughter from around the table. Then:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         HEARST 
</b>t             (quietly)
t           You are evidently a man who knows a great deal 
t          about bull.
<b>t
</b>tSome nervous titters. A beat as Welles' smile fades and he stares at 
tHearst.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         HEARST 
</b>t          Of all man's malignity -- of all his sadism -- none 
t          is more depraved than cruelty to animals.
<b>t

<b>t
</b>tMank gives Welles a desperate warning look to keep quiet Welles cannot 
tresist speaking:

</b>t          In Spain the cruelty would be in denying the beast 
t          a fighting end.
<b>t

<b>t
</b>tWelles cannot keep his eyes off Hearst, the press baron draws Welles in 
tlike a siren.
<b>t
</b>tMarion gives Hearst a little kiss and grabs Carole Lombard and they 
tleave the table. Hearst leans into Clark Gable to continue talking.
<b>t
</b>tWelles sits back and reaches for a cigar. Mank takes his arm and

</b>tThrough the open balcony doors he can hear the eerie sound of lions 
troaring and elephants trumpeting in the night.
<b>t
</b>tHe stand and wanders to the balcony. Below him he can see bits and 
tpieces of Hearst's private zoo in the moonlight: a lion pacing 
trelentlessly back and forth; an alligator slipping into the water; a 
tmonkey slamming into the bars of its cage.
<b>t

</b>tWelles roams the seemingly endless hallways of San Simeon. In the half-
tlight they begin to resemble his own cinematic dream-palace, Xanadu.
<b>t
</b>tHe hears the ghostly echo of a song, "WHERE OR WHEN".
<b>t
</b>tHe curiously follows the sound, taking in the fabulous castle 
teverywhere around him.

tas he scribbles down notes.
<b>t
</b>tMank, wearing sunglasses and a battered fedora and looking decidedly 
thung-over, comes from the house to the pool.

t          crap?! What the fuck did you ever CREATE? You're 
t          just another goddamn ACTOR!
<b>t
</b>tWelles shoves Mank violently. Mank goes sailing into the pool.
<b>t
</b>tMank splashes to the surface and stands for a shocked moment and then 
twades to the edge of the pool. Miraculously, and like the true drinker 
the is, Mank is still holding his glass of juice and vodka, now 
tsupplemented with pool water.
<b>t
</b>tWelles stands above him, blocking his exit from the pool. From this low 
tangle Welles suddenly looks startlingly Kane- like.

<b>t
</b>tAnd we leap into MONTAGE -- WELLES AND MANK BRAINSTORM
<b>t
</b>tA rush of jazzy. Gene Krupa percussion as Welles and Mank develop their 
tstory.
<b>t
</b>tWe see images of feverish creativity. Welles raging, pleading, arguing, 
tpushing. Mank responding, laughing, drinking, writing.
<b>t
</b>tIt is a passionate dance of creation Welles' tennis court Mank and 
tWelles are on the tennis court, but hard at work.
<b>t
</b>tMank waits for Welles to serve. Welles bounces the tennis ball, but is 
ttoo preoccupied to serve as:
<b>t
</b><b>t                         WELLES 
</b>t          The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this

<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t                         MANK 
</b>t          So when was our man innocent? Was there a moment 
t          early on -- of innocence and bliss? There must have 
t          been. Okay, you're dying - what do you think?
<b>t
</b>tWelles does not answer. He continues to bounce the tennis ball, deep in 
tthought.
<b>t
</b>tA beat
<b>t
</b><b>t                         MANK 
</b>t             (probing)
t          Something you lost maybe?

</b>t          Something you can never get back?
<b>t
</b>tMank watches as Welles lets the tennis ball drop. It bounces and rolls 
t-- for a fleeting moment in Welles' mind  it seems to become the rolling 
tsnow globe from KANE -- we hear the sound of sleigh bells and a child's 
thappy voice -- in the snow globe we seem to see a boy laughing and 
tpelting his father with snowballs. . .
<b>t
</b>tThen more images, mad and outlandish and sedate and solemn; in the 
tkitchen, in a car, around the pool, in a bar.
<b>t
</b>tWelles and Mank act out scenes and argue. They leap from character to 
tcharacter fearlessly. Emoting and laughing and writing. We see the twin 
tjoy and terror of walking the tightrope, of sheer creation.
<b>t
</b>tWe see them having a ferocious argument. They scream back and forth 
tangrily and then Mank storms out and slams the door. Welles stands 
talone in his living room, he catches a glimpse of his own reflection in 
ta mirror and we hear:

<b>t

<b>t

trejecting matte paintings and in makeup and rewriting the script and 
ttrying on costumes and selecting props and leaping into odd positions 
tlooking for the perfect camera angle.

tto one another about their newest outlandish idea.

tfrom his lips...

tSusan Alexander. He is relentless with her off camera, driving her to 
tthe harridan outbursts he wants just before he steps into the shot...

</b>tWe see the crew observing, with great amusement, Welles' stumbling 
tattempts to learn the "Charlie Kane" dance...
<b>t
</b>tWe see Toland shifting lights to achieve deep-focus cross-fades. Welles 
trages as the difficult process eats up time...

tpressure are clearly taking a toll..

tfalls from his mouth and begins smoldering on his suit.

</b>t"SING, SING, SING" fades at... On a Xanadu set:

tCommingore as Susan Alexander. He is curiously distracted. She is

this face.

</b>t          This is the shooting script we've been using every

</b>t          He showed me the world, he took me with him

t          ...embarrassing. And I began to resent him Because I 
t          was so ... sparkling, you see.
<b>t
</b>tSo I cut him dead. I turned my back and I walked away because I didn't 
tneed him. He was getting in the way of my "genius." And he would write

tnever took his calls, and he showed up at school and I wouldn't see 
thim.

<b>t
</b>tTo cover his emotion Mank rises and goes into the kitchen to freshen 
this drink. We remain tight on Welles as we hear Mank's voice:

<b>t
</b>tWelles slowly smiles as the record of Gene Krupa's percussion segues 
tinto the unmistakable rhythms of "SING, SING, SING" and eclipses Mank's 
tvoice...
<b>t
</b>tAnd we see Welles everywhere, more energized than ever: perilous on a 
thigh crane; stuck in a cramped corner behind the camera; doing magic 
ttricks for the cast; sleeping as makeup is applied to his face...

tinspiring. . .

<b>t

tand makeup, carefully walking across the massive Kane Campaign 
tHeadquarters set toward us. We see the low angle black-and-white 
tcamera's perspective.

<b>t
</b>tWelles thinks for a moment and then bolts up. Toland watches, 
tmystified, as Welles races to a sound stage fire station and grabs a 
tfire axe. Welles storms back to the set and raises the axe high. Toland 
tquickly rolls away. And Welles slams the axe into the wooden floor of 
tthe set. He continues to hack at the floor.
<b>t

<b>t
</b>tWelles and Toland finally tear away the remnants of the wooden floor. 
tThey stare down, defeated. Under the wood is solid concrete.

</b><b>t                         WELLES 
</b>t          Get me a jackhammer.
<b>t

tWelles, always in motion, sweeps past Mank and Joseph Cotton.
<b>t

</b>t             (wryly, to Cotton)
t          There but for the grace of God, goes God.
<b>t
</b>tWelles slams to a halt in front of the unit physician and thrusts out 
tan arm. The physician injects him with a dose of B-12.
<b>t
</b>tWelles can barely wait for the injection before he speeds off.
<b>t
</b>tWelles supervises as Toland lowers the camera into the freshly dug hole 
tin the middle of the sound stage. Mank checks his watch, 3:30 AM.
<b>t
</b>tWelles leaps into the trench to check the camera setup.
<b>t
</b>tAgain we see the view through the black-and-white viewfinder. Joseph

</b>tWe see Cotton approaching. He finally stops inches away from the 
tcamera. His shoes and the far wall of the set are both in total focus. 
tIt is a breathtaking, vertiginous shot.
<b>t
</b>tThen we see Welles and Joseph Cotton rehearsing and rehearsing and 
tfilming and filming the scene. Endlessly

t          Let me tell you a story, son  So this was 1924, 
t          right? Hearst was throwing a birthday party for 
t          Thomas Ince, the old movie producer. They were all 
t          on the old man's yacht taking a nice jaunt from 
t          Pedro down to San Diego. Real foggy night it was. 
t          This was Hearst, Marion, Ince, Charlie Chaplin, 
t          Louella, the usual gorillas. So Hearst notices 
t          Marion slip off with Chaplin -- she was screwing 
t          everyone then -- and the old man goes nuts. Grabs 
t          his revolver and starts shooting. Just like Tom Mix, 
t          standing there blasting away through the fog. Boom -
t          - boom -- boom -- and Thomas Ince takes a bullet 
t          through the head. So now there's this dead guy lying 
t          on the deck. You'll see how this could be quite an 
t          embarrassment. So the empire goes into action. Nice 
t          and quiet and Ince was cremated lickety-split. No 
t          inquest and no police. It was right after this that 
t          Hearst gives Louella her life-time contract. Just to 
t          keep her all hush-hush.

tdream factory
<b>t
</b>tIn a bit of a daze, Welles slowly begins walking through the backlot. A 
tbustle of loud activity in a corner of the lot draws his attention.
<b>t
</b>tA bulldozer and a dozen workmen are busy tearing down the facade of a 
tlarge white mansion. They strip the wood off and toss it into an 
tincinerator.

tthought.

t          resulted in...
<b>t
</b>tThe radio voice fades to silence.
<b>t
</b>tThe silence continues but for the haunting echo of a lion roaring in 
tthe distance. Then Hearst hears the sound of footsteps echoing on the 
ttile. He looks up. It is Marion. She walks around the pool to him.
<b>t
</b>tWithout a word she hands him a check.
<b>t
</b>tIt is made out to William Randolph Hearst in the amount of one million 
tdollars and is signed Marion Davies.

tarm poised, waiting to begin conducting. He is about to record some new 
tmusic for the deep-focus Thatcher/Bernstein/Kane scene from CITIZEN 
<b>tKANE.
</b><b>t
</b>tWelles sits nearby, supervising everything. Welles nods and on a movie 
tscreen the scene from KANE begins and Hermann starts conducting. The 
torchestra plays.

</b>tIn a scene eerily reminiscent of the Thatcher/Bernstein/Kane scene,

<b>t
</b>tHearst has his back to them and stares out a window.

</b>tThe new man is MR. LEWIS, a tight banker from New York, 50's.

<b>t
</b>tSo ... who is Mr. Hearst and who is Mr. Welles? Mr. Hearst built a 
tpalace of brick and mortar and starting little wars and corpses piled 
thigh. I built a palace of illusion. My castle Xanadu is a matte 
tpainting and camera trick. It's nothing but . . . a dream.

tdoors close
<b>t
</b>tHe nips in at the last minute and punches his button. He turns.
<b>t
</b>tThe elevator is deserted but for one other person: William Randolph 
tHearst.
<b>t
</b>tWelles and Hearst recognize each other instantly. As the elevator 
tascends the two men look at each other.
<b>t
</b>tA very long pause as we watch their faces -- the young man and the old 
tman -- both men of mad grandeur and malevolent passion and stunning 
tinspiration -- both men of incalculable achievement and measureless 
tpoignancy.
<b>t
</b>tFinally:
<b>t

t          at the Palace. I would be pleased to get you 
t          tickets.
<b>t
</b>tA pause as Hearst regards Welles.
<b>t
</b>tThen Hearst carefully reaches over and presses the stop button on the 
televator. The elevator stops.
<b>t
</b>tAn exceedingly quiet exchange:
<b>t
</b>tA beat.
<b>t
</b>tA pause.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         HEARST

t          swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a 
t          belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, 
t          undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private 
t          lives should not be public property.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         WELLES 
</b>t          Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name 
t          and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. 
t          In your papers you taught the world how to look 
t          under every rock. I learned at the knee of the 
t          master.
<b>t
</b><b>t                         HEARST 
</b>t          So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind 
t          of sad future are we two making? A future where men 
t          will do anything to sell their newspapers and their 
t          movies? A future where no price is too high for fame 
t          and power? When we will all scratch each other to 
t          pieces just to be heard?
<b>t
</b>tCan you truly envision such ... horror.
<b>t
</b>tHearst presses the stop button again and the elevator begins to move.
<b>t
</b>tThe doors opens on Hearst's floor and he leaves the elevator.
<b>t
</b>tThe doors are about to shut on Welles when he leans forward; and roars:
