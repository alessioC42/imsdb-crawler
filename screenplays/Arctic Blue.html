<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>1tEXT.  BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Flying.  Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at
spitting distance from the treetops.  We're in central
Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.

A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
like a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins to
tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the
coming of autumn.

On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott
Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and
jagged that snow cannot stick to its face.  This is how all
North America once looked -- raw, indomitable.

Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching
across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin.
Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar,
depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.

Even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant
by the vastness of the land.  It goes on, and on, and on...

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
A lone MAN walks along the Haul Road, a one-lane gravel
trail running parallel to the pipeline.  The weather turns
sour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man's
path.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
The man is ERIC DESMOND, twenty-four, clean-shaven,
determined.  He's clearly out of place here, dressed in a
business suit and a light, camel-hair topcoat.

Eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- a
predator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote.  But the
footprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
The weather becomes more oppressive.  Heavy snow, gale winds
and sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous.  Eric
strives stubbornly forward.
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tttttttt(CONTINUED)
</b><b>1tCONTINUED:
</b>
<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
Eric has gathered some branches.  He tries to make a fire.
Moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar
of his insufficient coat, and his skin is split raw from the
cold.

His hands are too numb to hold the matches.  After several
attempts at striking one, he slumps down next to the pile of
wood, exhausted and frustrated.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
The snow has covered the pile of branches.  Eric still sits
next to it, partially covered in snow himself.

<b>ERIC
</b>
His face is a death mask: eyes half-open and dull, lips a
purplish blue, bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over.
The wind HOWLS around him.  The snow sticks to his eyelashes
and hair without melting.
<b>ttttttttt
</b><b>tttttttttEND DREAM
</b>
<b>2tINT.  DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Eric bolts up in bed.  Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits
up and hugs him.  All that can be seen of her in the dark is
a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair.  After a
moment, Eric kisses her.  He shakes off the dream and lies
back down.

<b>3tEXT.  HAUL ROAD AND PIPELINE - CLOSE - DAY
</b>
A metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near a
pipeline support piling:
<b>tttttt
</b><b>tttPIPELINE UTILITY CORRIDOR
</b><b>tttt  PRIVATE PROPERTY
</b><b>tttt  NO   TRESPASSING
</b><b>tttt  NOt  HUNTING
</b><b>tttt  NOt TRAPPING
</b><b>tttt  NOt SHOOTING
</b>
<b>WIDER
</b>
Eric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something ahead
of him.  Although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he's
confident and resolute in attitude.  His clothes have a
distinctly western feel: Lucchese boots, Levis 501's, Mahan
cotton shirt.  His down parka is unzipped in the sunny,
windless, forty-degree afternoon.
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tttttttt(CONTINUED)
</b><b>3tCONTINUED:
</b>
He pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a
four-power scope mounted atop it.  He peers through the
scope.

<b>HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
</b>
He puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big,
ivory-white timber wolf, fifty yards away.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Anne Marie stands beside Eric, a Nikon with a telephoto lens
in her hand, holding her breath in anticipation.  She's
twenty-three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blue
eyes.  She wears Eddie Bauer woman's gear like she was born
in it.

Eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger.
But instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull POP of
a CO2-powered dart gun.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshy
shoulder.  The wolf takes off running, but almost
immediately slows, sits, then lies down.

Eric and Anne Marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathing
deeply.  Eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttWhat a beauty.
ttt(to Anne Marie)
tttHand me the transmitter.

Anne Marie passes to Eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device
attached to a steel collar band.  Eric puts the collar
loosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all
the while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal.
Anne Marie smiles at Eric's tenderness and snaps some
photos.

With the collar in place and transmitter activated, Eric
backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its
narcosis.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>ttt(continuing)
tttHe's coming around fine.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttANNE MARIE
</b>tttBe right back.  I left my
tttcamcorder in the car.
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tttttttt(CONTINUED)
</b><b>3tCONTINUED:  (2)
</b>
<b>FOLLOW ANNE MARIE
</b>
as she hurries back to their International Scout.  On the
door of the Scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick,
under which are the words:
<b>tttttt
</b><b>tttNORTHLAND PETROLEUM CORP.
</b>
Anne Marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera.

<b>ANGLE ON ERIC AND THE WOLF
</b>
Eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and
trots unsteadily away.  Near the treeline the wolf turns,
glances back at Eric and then disappears into the forest.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Anne Marie is taping the wolf's retreat.  Looking through
the viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipeline
piling and a rock formation.  Eric turns toward her and a
glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttAnne Marie!  Stop!

She glances down.  Something metal is half-buried in the
dead leaves and gravel.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>ttt(continuing)
tttDon't move.

Eric runs over.  He pokes at the object with a stick.  With
a SNAP, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half.  Anne
Marie jumps back.  Eric brushes the dead leaves on the
ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the
gully.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>ttt(continuing)
tttGoddamn trappers!

He angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthing
several others attached to one another by a long chain.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>ttt(continuing)
tttTakes nerve, laying traplines on
tttrestricted land.

Eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the
pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring poINT.
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tttttttt(CONTINUED)
</b><b>3tCONTINUED:  (3)
</b>
Using the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down the
Haul Road.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttANNE MARIE
</b>tttWhat are you doing?
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttHe still might be around.  I saw
tttfresh tire tracks coming in.

<b>HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
</b>
The road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon,
north and south.  In the distance, a jeep is parked on the
Haul Road.  Near it, a Man climbs down into another shallow
ravine.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Eric hurries down the footpegs.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttMan and a jeep, about a mile and
ttta half down.

He jumps into the Scout.  Anne Marie stuffs her cameras into
the hatchback.  As soon as she climbs in, Eric tears out.

<b>4tINT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
It races along the dusty gravel road at 60 MPH.

<b>5tEXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Startled at the APPROACH of the Scout, the Trapper uproots
his traps and runs out of the ravine.  He WHISTLES and
another Trapper appears nearby.

<b>6tINT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP
</b>
They pile into their dilapidated, all-terrain jeep.  It's
oddly well-equipped, however.  Bolted to the dashboard is an
expensive tape player and a beat-up radio beacon receiver
with a round locating screen.  They zoom off.

<b>7tINT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Eric stomps on the gas.  The dust from the jeep obscures his
view but he's gaining on them anyway.  Anne Marie hangs on
and squints her eyes against the choking dust.



<b>8tINT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
The driver is LEMALLE (35), a tall, ugly, rawboned Canadian.
His entire outfit is made of animal hide.  He has long red
hair, and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic
sneer.  While driving, he scans along the pipeline.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttLEMALLE
</b>tttWhere the fuck did you drop
tttCorbett off?

In the passenger seat, MITCHELL (38), chews tobacco and
looks grim.  He's a squat, flat-faced Okie, with curly
matted hair and tired grey eyes.  He's dressed in a brown
long coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw
holster strapped to his leg.  Despite his intimidating air,
confrontation is not his style.

He spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy
creek.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttMITCHELL
</b>tttHe's over there.

<b>9tEXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Turning sharply, the trappers' jeep splashes through the
creek bed without slowing.  Bouncing, it comes down hard
against the axle-deep bank at the creek's high water mark.
LeMalle tries to back out, but can't find traction in the
mud.

Eric stops the Scout thirty yards behind them.

<b>10   INT.  SCOUT
</b>
Eric opens his door.  To Anne Marie:
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttStay here.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttANNE MARIE
</b>tttBe careful -- there're two of
tttthem.

Eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to Anne
Marie.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttIf I unzip my parka, stick this
tttout the window.

<b>11   EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
Eric confidently approaches the jeep.
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tttttttt(CONTINUED)
</b><b>11   CONTINUED:
</b>
Then, a third trapper climbs from the creek.  He's got a
line of traps slung around his neck and a world of
experience on his face.  He's BEN CORBETT, a life-long
huntsman, somewhere past forty, weathered beyond his years.

He has a feral nose, thick beard and dark, smart, hunter's
eyes.  He wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt, cotton
coveralls and vapor-barrier mountain boots.  On his belt is
a holster rig cradling a .44 magnum revolver.

Eric slows down.  He didn't expect to face anyone as
formidable as Corbett.

<b>12   INT. / EXT. JEEP
</b>
Emboldened by Corbett's presence, LeMalle reaches into the
back seat and grabs his 6.5 by 55 Swedish military carbine.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttCORBETT
</b>ttt(to LeMalle)
tttNo shooting.  Let's see who's so
tttinterested in us.

Corbett has an incongruously affable voice.  He throws his
traps into the jeep, then strides closer toward Eric.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttMITCHELL
</b>ttt(to Corbett)
tttAin't worth it, Ben...

<b>13   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING - LONG SHOT
</b>
As Corbett comes closer, Eric realizes this might not've
been a great idea.  Corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the
air, as if by this he can gauge his opponent's mettle.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttYou got two counts against you --
ttttrapping out of season and
tttpoaching on restricted land.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttCORBETT
</b>tttCan't be much of a crime, if all
tttthey got minding the area is a
tttcocky kid.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttI got your plate number, asshole.
tttMaybe you feel like spending a
tttfew months in jail.

Corbett just smiles.
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tttttttt(CONTINUED)
</b><b>13   CONTINUED:
</b>
But LeMalle, rankled, sticks the carbine out the jeep
window.

Seeing the rifle pointed at him, Eric freezes, then slowly
unzips his parka.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttLEMALLE
</b>tttBen?  Sure you don't want me to
tttdrop the fucker?

Corbett doesn't answer.  Then, his eyes narrow and he looks
past Eric at the Scout.

<b>CORBETT'S POV
</b>
The passenger in the Scout sticks what looks like another
rifle out the window.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Eric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure Anne
Marie's backing him up.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttYou leave and don't come back,
tttthat's the end of it.

After a long moment, Corbett smiles again, then turns away
from Eric.  He motions LeMalle to the front of the jeep.

Frustrated, LeMalle slams back the safety on the carbine and
throws it in the back seat.

<b>ANGLE ON TRAPPERS
</b>
Mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine.
LeMalle and Corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut.
While pushing, Corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp
piece of granite.   He cusses and pushes harder.

<b>14   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING
</b>
Eric walks back to the Scout.  He feels the trappers' eyes
on his back, but forces himself not to hurry.

The trappers free their vehicle.  Corbett gets in the
driver's seat, and they take off.

<b>15   INT.  SCOUT
</b>
Anne Marie's hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic
tranquilizer rifle back in the window.

</b>tttBastards took off, though, didn't
tttthey?

<b>16   EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
The trappers have left the flatlands of the Haul Road area.
Now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills.

<b>17   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
</b>
Corbett broods while driving.  Mitchell looks out the
window.  The silence makes LeMalle uncomfortable.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttLEMALLE
</b>tttAll this fuckin' land, and we're
tttlocked out.  Makes me puke.

</b>tttThen don't look to your left.

<b>18   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP
</b>
A brand-new Land Rover is parked on an alluvial fan in a
bend in a small river.  Scattered about is an assortment of
expensive camping gear, beer cans, spent shells and other
garbage.

Three toy-macho, vacationing SPORTSMEN are guzzling beer and
BLASTING fish in the shallow river with 12-gauge shotguns.
They look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and
stops.

<b>19   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP

LeMalle grabs his carbine.

tttRelax.  I just want to ask them
ttthow the hunting is.

<b>20   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP
</b>
Corbett gets out of the jeep.  He regards the Sportsmen,
their shotguns and their mess with ill-concealed contempt.

The Sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch Corbett.  He
walks around the camp, spotting a rubber-lined rucksack
stuffed with dead ermine.  After a long, tense moment,
Corbett smiles.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttCORBETT
</b>tttLooks like you've had some luck.
tttWhere's your guide?
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttSPORTSMAN #1
</b>tttWe're on our own, if it's any of
tttyour damn business.

He crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur.

tttNo swinging shit.  They're over
ttttheir goddamned limit.
<b>ttttt

ttthave a licensed guide when you're
ttton this land, too.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttSPORTSMAN #1
</b>tttHey, we paid our fuckin' permit
tttfees.

LeMalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire.  No one
notices that in the b.g., quiet Sportsman #3 unzips his
parka, exposing a .45 Peacemaker in a belt holster.

tttThis was my roaming land, 'til

tttOnly Innuit can hunt here now,
tttand tourists, like you.

Corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of
the Land Rover.  Pissed, Sportsmen #1 and #2 step closer to
him.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttCORBETT
</b>ttt(continuing)
tttAccording to tribal law, hunters
tttpassing through the land of
tttanother tribe can only take game
tttto survive.  They can eat the
tttmeat, but have to surrender the
ttthides.

LeMalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of the
ermine.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttLEMALLE
</b>tttWant the meat?
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttSPORTSMAN #1
</b>
tttFuck you, dirtball.

Corbett chuckles and Mitchell spits.

<b>WIDER
</b>
LeMalle digs through the camping goodies in the back of the
Land Rover, many still in their packages.  He helps himself
to some sandwiches and a 12-pack of beer.

ttttheir shiny new car.

Corbett looks down to fasten the top of the rucksack.

</b>
<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Suddenly, Sportsman #3 reaches inside his parka and pulls
the pistol.  He swings it toward LeMalle.

LeMalle looks up when he hears the HAMMER cock.

There is a deafeningly loud SHOT.

Sportsman #3 falls down dead at LeMalle's feet.

Off to one side, Corbett holds a huge, smoking .44 magnum
six-shooter in his hand.

Shotgun in hand, Sportsman #1 gauges his chances of blasting
Corbett.  Nil.  When Corbett turns to him, he lies the
weapon down.  Sportsman #2 rushes to his friend.

Looking bleak, Mitchell spits again.  Corbett crosses to
LeMalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted to
steal.  Chastised, LeMalle smolders.  After a moment:
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttCORBETT
</b>ttt(to Sportsmen)
tttPut him in your truck.  Smell of
tttblood will attract the bears.
ttt(to trappers)
tttLet's go.

As Corbett walks to the jeep, he's too angry to notice that
he's stepped in a patch of mud under the Land Rover.

Near the jeep, LeMalle stops and pulls them into a huddle.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttLEMALLE
</b>
tttI don't believe in leavin'

Corbett turns and FIRES two rounds from his .44 into the
engine of the Land Rover.  The Sportsmen stare and sputter.

Corbett and Mitchell get in their jeep.

<b>LEMALLE
</b>
isn't yet satisfied.  He walks back over to the Sportsmen,
kneeling beside their fallen friend, and crouches right
beside them.  Intimidated, Sportsman #2 looks away, but
LeMalle grabs his chin and turns his face back toward him.
<b>ttttt

</b>tttThink I'm pretty?  You better
tttforget how we look, 'cause next
ttttime they won't keep me from

He unsheathes his buck knife.  BELOW FRAME, he slices across
the forehead of the dead Sportsman, peels back his scalp and
cuts it loose, Indian-style.  The Sportsmen are stunned and
sickened.

<b>21   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DUSK
</b>
Devil's Cauldron Hot Springs is a cluster of twenty tiny
dwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk.  The town
squats, ugly and temporary-looking, in a dirt clearing fifty
miles north of the Arctic Circle.  Thirty miles east of the
Pipeline, it's almost dead center of interior Alaska.

At the edge of town is a gravel airstrip.  Mixed with the
prospector-era sod-roof cabins are a few prefabricated
houses.  The boon brought by men building the pipeline is
long gone.  Now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and
bush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the
depression of the oncoming winter.

Enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually
blanket the valley with fog.  The spa is log-walled and
horseshoe- shaped, with partitioned baths inside.  Facing it

LEO MEYERLING opens the tailgate of a Dodge truck with the
Northland Petroleum logo and "District Supervisor" on the
door.  Meyerling is short and bald with a completely
disreputable face.  He staples a poster on a wall.  It has a
picture of him on it, and:

<b>22   EXT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
</b>
Corbett and the other trappers drive past Meyerling and park
their jeep as the sun disappears behind the foothills.

<b>23   INT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE
</b>
A handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church
meetings reads: "Live each day so you can look every damn
man in the eye and tell him to go to hell."  There is a post
office in the corner with some combination boxes and a
wicketless window.

The trappers come in.  Corbett sits in a chair and pulls his
boots off.  One of his wool socks is wet.  He nods to the
man sitting in the other chair, SAM WILDER.  Wilder is short
and tough, with a full head of crewcut grey hair and
weather- ravaged face that makes him look older than his
sixty years.

A chubby Inupiat (interior Eskimo), wearing thick glasses,
several heavy sweaters and battery-heated socks, fusses
behind the counter.  He's EARL KENAI, owner of the hot
springs spa and the general store.

LeMalle chews on a handful of bear jerky.  Kenai stares at
LeMalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky.  Corbett
pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to Kenai.

Meyerling smiles like a toad, then slaps another poster on

back and the trappers laugh.  Meyerling looks to Wilder for

An early STORM has blown in from the north, bringing
whipping winds and freezing rain.

Corbett peers out the tiny window, frowning.  LeMalle cleans
his carbine while eating beans and bacon.  Mitchell hunches
over a table.  He's making a scrimshaw -- delicately
engraving, using homemade tools, on a palm-sized piece of
whale bone.  He rubs his eyes and looks up at Corbett.

<b>26   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - "THE TURTLE" - DAY
</b>
The winds have died down.  The rain has turned to a light
snow.

A mobile arctic dwelling sits on a rise next to the Haul
Road.  It's a double-unit weathertight cocoon of fiberglass
and aluminum, pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires.
The front module is 12 by 24, the rear 12 by 18.

An extended-cab pickup pulls up and Sam Wilder gets out.
The gravel-and-dirt Haul Road, paralleling the pipeline for
400 miles, is closed to the public.  An arriving vehicle,
therefore, is news.  The front door of the dwelling opens.
Eric and Anne Marie come outside, delighted to see Wilder.

Anne Marie shoots a look at Eric but doesn't disagree --
this is obviously an issue with them.  Wilder looks with
amusement at the mobile dwelling.

<b>27   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
Everything seems peaceful enough.  The SOS fire (made from
burning green branches for white smoke and rubber for black
smoke) has burnt down to embers.

Eric, Anne Marie and Wilder pull up in Wilder's pickup.

The two Sportsmen sit in the front seat of the Land Rover,
but they don't react to the arrival of the rescuers.  In the
back seat, a reflective camping blanket covers a large mass.

Something is amiss.  Eric shoots a look of trepidation at
Anne Marie as they get out of the pickup.   Wilder pulls the
door of the Land Rover open.

A Sportsman slumps out onto the ground.  His eyes are open
and his tongue pokes out between his lips.  His skin is
blue-white. (He looks, in fact, much like Eric's nightmare.)

Startled, Eric steps back.  Anne Marie gasps with horror.
Wilder unzips the Sportsman's light windbreaker and listens
for a heartbeat.  Nothing.
<b>ttttt

tttQuestion is why they sat here
tttwhen the storm moved in.  Check
ttttheir stuff while I sniff around.

Wilder tries the ignition.  The starter TURNS OVER, but the
engine makes a horrendous GRINDING.  He walks to the front
of the vehicle.  Noticing the bullet holes in the grille, he
bends down for a closer look.

<b>NEW ANGLE

Eric opens the rear hatchback and digs through the plentiful
supplies.  Still in their packages are some matchbox-sized
ELT locating beacons.

</b>
Anne Marie opens the back door of the Land Rover.  She pulls
back the camping blanket... and uncovers the third
Sportsman.  The torn red flesh on his head and his
bugged-out eyes are a hideous sight.

Anne Marie SCREAMS and stumbles away.

<b>28   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP - LAND ROVER
</b>
Eric runs over to her as she tries to catch her breath.

Wilder looks at the third Sportsman and angrily kicks the
side of the Land Rover.

The town is quiet.



<b>30   INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Corbett soaks in one of the huge wooden tubs with a pudgy
Inupiat hooker, DIXIE.

He looks up as Eric comes into the spa.  Eric holds
Corbett's boots, which have been repaired.  Eric pauses when
he sees Corbett.  There is a flash of recognition between
them.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC

</b>tttNo big deal.  We just got off on
tttthe wrong foot.  What's your
tttname?

Eric glances down at Corbett's duffel bag, which sits on the
floor next to Corbett's tub.  Corbett's magnum rests on top
of it, well within reach.  Corbett notices Eric's interest
in it.  He leans back and smiles.

Putting his hand on Dixie's shoulder, Corbett stands and
gets out of the tub.  His sinewy body, resembling a
scarecrow made of steel cable, is covered with scars.  He
wraps a towel around his waist and crosses to Eric.

boots.

tttYou wouldn't shoot anyone...

Wilder has come in the back way and stands behind Corbett

Wilder comes out of the spa with his shotgun and Corbett's
duffel bag cradled in his arm.  Handcuffed, Corbett walks in
front of him.

Kenai looks down to avoid eye contact with Corbett as he
goes by.  Corbett stops next to Eric and smiles.

as he leads Corbett along the boardwalk to the other end of
town.  They approach a prefab house perched on skids under a
tall antenna tower.  Mounted above the shack, a DC wind
charger turbine spins lazily in the faint breeze.  From
within the cabin comes an anomalous SOUND -- MTV.  Wilder
KNOCKS on the door.

ARTHUR NEFF, a pasty-white, 45-year-old ex-Texan, pulls the
door open.  His customary grin fades when he sees Corbett.

<b>33   INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE

In one room, there is a wood-burning cookstove and an Ashley
heat stove, a table, a bunk and a small window.  Behind a

Nylon storage netting along the ceiling holds Eric's
research equipment and Anne Marie's photographic supplies.
In one corner of the Turtle are several of her black and

juxtaposed with the natural surroundings.

Relieved he's home in one piece, Anne Marie meets Eric at

An old primer-grey station wagon rattles into town and
parks.  With an unlit cheroot stuck in his mouth, "VIKING"
BOB CORBETT gets out and stretches.  He's 38, six-foot-six,
with sandy hair, beard, ruddy skin, and his brother's dark

Kenai poking around in front of Wilder's cabin.

Illuminated by a bare bulb is Wilder's typical bush-country
front yard.  Piled are five cords of wood, boxes, tarps,

machines, wash tubs, tires, etc.

Bunching his collar around his neck, Kenai shivers and sorts

outside.

As soon as he's out the door, Corbett cranes his neck and

Viking Bob responds by flinging a heavy trap at Wilder, then
punching him in the gut.  Wilder sprawls among the junk,
dropping his revolver.  Kenai freezes, not about to take
sides.

Before Viking Bob can come at him again, Wilder grabs for
his .357. Viking Bob jumps back and bolts for his car.

Anne Marie sits on the floor, editing one of her VIDEOTAPES.

two ELT pendants.  He glances over at the monitor and nods
approvingly.

There is a full moon and a clear night sky.  Viking Bob's

He hears an ENGINE starting in the distance.  Sitting up, he

He zooms ahead and gets in front of his quarry, then drops
back down onto the road and waits in ambush.

As Wilder's truck approaches, Viking Bob turns on his bright

Wilder's truck screeches to a stop.

Viking Bob slowly approaches Wilder's truck.

A bottle of Eric's Scotch sits almost empty on the table
beside Wilder.  Wilder dozes in a chair facing Corbett.

Corbett is awake.  He contorts his body to bring his
handcuff chain under his feet and get his hands in front of
him.  He eyes Wilder's .357.  It's in a lefty Sam Browne
holster.  No way to take it without waking Wilder.

Corbett stands and inches toward the door.  As he pulls it
open, the insulation makes enough NOISE to stir Wilder.

Wilder gets up and pushes Corbett back into his chair.

Wilder's mind clears enough to realize that Corbett's hands
are in front of him.  He reaches for his .357.  Corbett
butts into Wilder's midsection with his head.  Amazingly,
Wilder stays on his feet.

Corbett hurries back to the door.  Wilder lunges,
bull-determined to hold onto him.  Corbett smashes Wilder
across the face with his clenched hands.  Wilder goes down
hard, hitting his head on the table, and stays there.
Corbett instinctively kneels to see if Wilder is still
breathing.  But then, hearing MOVEMENT in the rear module,
Corbett flees.

Eric rushes in.  The outside door is open and Wilder lies on
the floor.   His holster is empty.  Anne Marie comes in and
crosses to Wilder.

Eric pulls a floor trap door open and digs through the
company-issue equipment, coming up with a huge Remington
bolt-action bear rifle.  Unfamiliar with weapons, Eric tears
open a box of shells and fumbles to load the rifle.

Eric fires a loud warning SHOT from the Turtle doorway.

Corbett sits in the Scout for a long moment, weighing his
odds.  He takes his hands off the steering wheel...

Eric SHOOTS again, this time SMASHING the side-view mirror
and window next to Corbett's head.

Still handcuffed, Corbett gets out of the Scout.  Holding
the .357 gingerly by the butt, he puts it on the hood of the
Scout.

Viking Bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt
road.  The huge night sky all but smothers the weak light
from the town up ahead.

Cache seems a mistake -- a jumble of unpainted buildings in
the middle of a big nothing, twenty miles north of the
Arctic Circle.  Still, it's more animated than Devil's
Cauldron.  There are a hundred permanent residents, several
taverns and a three-store, fly-in shopping center.

Even though it's the middle of the night, people roam the

storefront awnings, drunken INDIANS sleep on the concrete.

Viking Bob cruises the main drag, looking for the other
trappers.  He spots their jeep in front of a
dangerous-looking saloon called the "Bear Sign Inn."

The Scout sits idling in a depression near the creek bed,

After giving the trappers time to get around the next bend,
Eric drives the Scout up the embankment and crosses back

The prefab bridge is the transportable type used by the Army
Corps of Engineers, left over from the building of the

<b>76   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
The gasoline can EXPLODES, tearing the bridge couplings away
from the concrete abutment.

<b>77   EXT.  HAUL ROAD
</b>
The trappers see the explosion behind them.  They turn
around and head toward it.

<b>78   EXT.  PUMPING STATION - HANGAR
</b>
Eric parks the Scout sideways to block the way to the
airstrip.

With the magnum at the ready, Eric cuts Corbett's handcuffs
loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar.

The leeward side of the structure is a huge metal door on
rollers.  Eric unlocks it and rolls it back.  Inside is a
Cessna 182, dusted with snow and ice blown through the
cracks by crosswinds.  Eric brushes the windshield with his
sleeve.

<b>79   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
The trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge
burning and disconnected from the creek bank.

<b>80   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA
</b>
Eric helps Corbett into the cockpit, then secures his
handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope.

<b>81   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
Viking Bob assesses the damage to the bridge.  Loose from
the abutments, it wobbles like a diving board.  Below, the
water is too deep and fast-moving to be traversable.



<b>82   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA
</b>
Eric tries to turn the ENGINE over.  The starter is sluggish
from cold and lack of use.

<b>83   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK
</b>
Viking Bob looks at the others, bursting with frustration.
He climbs into the driver's seat.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttVIKING BOB
</b>tttGet in.  We can jump it.

They hop in.  He SCREECHES backwards to get a running start,
REVS the engine, pops the clutch, and tears toward the
bridge.

As they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckle
under them.  With a sickening WRENCHING, the crossbar
supports crumple.

The jeep flies through the still-burning gasoline, becomes
airborne, and SCRAPES to a rude stop on the edge of the
pavement on the other side, the back wheels dangling in
space.

LeMalle and Mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass end
of the jeep onto solid earth.

<b>84   INT.  HANGAR
</b>
Eric finally STARTS the plane and taxis out onto the landing
strip.

<b>85   EXT.  PUMPING STATION
</b>
The trappers drive up to where the Scout blocks their path.
They pile out of their jeep and run toward the landing
strip.

<b>86   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
It picks up speed and takes off.

<b>ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)

Below, the trappers watch the plane zoom over their heads.
LeMalle points his carbine at it, but Viking Bob pushes the
rifle down.

<b>87   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Corbett scowls as he sees the trappers helpless below him.



<b>88   EXT.  PUMPING STATION

Viking Bob watches, wide-eyed with fury.  Mitchell spits.
LeMalle punches the wall.  Then he turns and repeatedly
BLASTS the Scout, parked nearby, with his carbine.

<b>89   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

Eric's knapsack, an emergency kit and several five-gallon
cans of aviation fuel are tucked behind the seats.

Eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the

of the controls.

Eric ignores the jibe.  He stays at 2,000 feet, making the
landscape all the more immediate.

Corbett stares out the window and broods.  He spots an open,
snow-covered area where some dark blotches mar the
whiteness.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)

While talking in an even tone, Corbett intently studies the
instrument panel and scans the landscape below.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttCORBETT
</b>tttThe idea was to get to the
tttsupplies before the bears did.
tttAlong the route we'd set our

Corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains, above
the tree line.

tttLot of times we didn't even have
ttta landing strip.  We'd set down

tttthere.  Yeah, that one's easy;
tttyou could glide right in...

Suddenly, he turns in the seat and pins Eric against the
door with his left foot.

The plane flies erratically.  With his right foot, Corbett
kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel,
jamming it on.

<b>90   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
The lever, used to empty the fuel tanks in case of
emergency, does so with great expediency.  All the gas is
instantly discharged.



<b>91   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Corbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat.

Eric rubs his neck, incredulous.  Corbett's move was too
fast and too outrageous.  In a moment, the engine SPUTTERS
to a stop.  Eric struggles to hold the stick steady and
glide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttCORBETT
</b>tttHope you got your money's worth
ttton those lessons.

<b>92   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
There's an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the
plateau.  Eric pushes the Cessna's nose down.  The plateau
comes up fast.

The plane drops lower and lower, pitching and yawing in the
wind.

It CRASH LANDS, its metal underbelly SCREECHING as it hits
the jagged granite under the snow.  It stops suddenly,
flipping tail over nose.

<b>93   INT.  CESSNA
</b>
It rests upside down in the snow.  The men are dazed.

Behind Eric, one of the extra fuel cans, now hanging upside
down, leaks gas.  In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE.

Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leg
gets caught in the tangled belt.  He pulls out a Swiss Army
knife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to the
seat.  Corbett pushes the passenger door open.  Panicking,
Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfully
wrenching his ankle.

<b>94   EXT.  CESSNA
</b>
Corbett rolls out into the snow.  With no time to grab his
supplies, Eric clambers from the wreckage.  He and Corbett
crawl/roll down the incline of the plateau, away from the
plane.

A moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine
and the Cessna EXPLODES.

<b>WIDER

Eric tries to stand.  He cries out and falls into the
powdery snow, clutching at his ankle.

Corbett realizes Eric is at a disadvantage.  But before he
can bolt, Eric grabs for the .357 magnum under his coat.  He
lies on the snow, gasping, pointing the gun at Corbett's
midsection.

burning plane.

Corbett drops his facade of conviviality.  Eric is too angry
to be intimidated.  He takes the scarf from around his neck
and wraps his ankle with it.

sun, counts forward to noon, and, accordingly, makes an
approximation of their direction.

Grimacing with pain, he gets up.  Clutching the magnum, he
shoves Corbett in front of him and starts walking.  Corbett
frowns -- it's tough to trudge through the snow with his
arms cuffed tightly behind his back.

Eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register
on his face.  They wouldn't be farther from the rest of
humanity on another planet.  Smelling fear on Eric, Corbett
enjoys the view.  And waits.

<b>95   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
The Endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams and
gnarled tundra valleys.  Squinting in the glare of the snow,
Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the
Arctic area.  The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won,
snow-covered mile behind them.

Intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy
tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding
mosaics upon the landscape.  The air is still.  The silence

is itself a disconcerting presence.  Ten miles ahead and two
thousand feet lower, the forest begins.  But here, on the
rock face of the mountains, Eric and Corbett might as well
be in a desert.

The sun drops behind the mountains.  A wind whips up,
chilling the men through their clothing.  Eric tries not to
shiver.  He spies a small rock formation with a granite
elbow protruding from it, making an enclosed triangle of
solid rock.

the rocks.  Although he knows Corbett is testing his every
move, Eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him.

Eric approaches him suspiciously.  He puts his hand down
through Corbett's collar.  Something is stowed inside a
homemade flap in the lining of his coat.  Eric pulls out a

to the granite rock formation, making a minimal but
functional refuge from the cold night.

<b>98   INT.  NYLON SHELTER

The men huddle inside the tarp.  Eric keeps a wary eye on
Corbett -- at all times he treats him like a rattlesnake.
Eric unwraps his ankle and rubs it.  It's swollen to the
size of a softball.

While poking the .357 in Corbett's ribs, Eric one-handedly
unlocks Corbett's right manacle, pulls his arm through the
granite elbow, then locks it back up again.  He's learning.

<b>99   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - DREAM  - (AS IN SCENE 3)

Eric is hurrying along the pipeline in his business suit,

it's Corbett.  His hands and face are covered in blood.

The light hits Eric's eyes.  He bolts awake from a fitful
sleep.  Corbett sits, already awake, looking like he'd
uproot the rock to which he's chained if he could.  He waits
for an opportunity -- any opportunity -- with the patience
of a vulture.

Eric and Corbett trudge up to the bank of a frozen stream
bisecting their path.  It's simple -- to continue, they have
to cross it.  Corbett takes in the scenery, in no particular
hurry.  Frustrated, but making dead sure he's always got the
drop on Corbett,  Eric puts a tentative foot on the ice.

Eric doesn't want to be too far from his prisoner.  He keeps
coming.  The ice GROANS and HISSES under their weight.

Corbett is three feet from solid ground.  He drops to his
knees, then stomach, and rolls like a log the rest of the
way.

Eric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across.  The ice
makes an ominous CRACKING and water begins to seep through
air holes.

Standing, Corbett weighs his chances of bolting from Eric.

Eric crawls doubletime.  He makes it onto solid ground just
as the ice under him breaks off in a big, thin, clear plate.

<b>106  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAY
</b>
Eric limps further down from the mountains.  Corbett keeps
pace in front of him and his magnum.  As their altitude
decreases, there is ever thicker vegetation.

Their tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the
distance.  The magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings
cannot be overstated.  Picture the most rustic, overwhelming
wilderness imaginable, and then make it ten times larger.

<b>NEW ANGLE - LATER
</b>
The men's way is once again interrupted, this time by a
sheer granite drop. The steep decline would be tough to
negotiate with mountaineering equipment and proper footwear.
Corbett peers over the edge and shakes his head.

Eric realizes he's right.  After some deliberation, Eric
cautiously approaches him.  With the .357 cocked and ready,
he undoes one of the cuffs, leaving them hanging from
Corbett's wrist.  He then unthreads the nylon twine from
Corbett's tarp.

<b>ANGLE - GRANITE SHEER
</b>
Eric and Corbett are tied, belt to belt, with the nylon
rope.  Corbett inches down first, feet spread for maximum
footing, gloveless hands grasping at anything.

Eric mimics Corbett's moves and follows the same path.
Unable to grasp the rocks effectively, he stops and takes
his gloves off.  Continuing, he winces -- the rock is cold
and sharp.  His hands are soon numb and bloody.  Even in the
dry, below-freezing air, Eric is sweating.

He looks down and hangs on more tightly.  Sliding to level
ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger.
Corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks.  Eric
is right above him.
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tttttttt(CONTINUED)
</b><b>106  CONTINUED:

Suddenly, Corbett's foot slips.  His right hand
instinctively goes for a hold.  The dangling handcuffs snare
on a protuberance, knocking him off balance.

The fulcrum of Corbett's body leans out into the empty air.
Eric moves down a little, braces himself and extends his
leg, giving Corbett something to grab.  Corbett takes hold
of Eric's shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock
wall.  Adrenaline screams through Eric's system.

Corbett looks up at Eric.  A careless move will send them
both tumbling.  Eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits
for the worst.

After a long moment, Corbett regains his balance and lets go
of Eric's foot.  He continues his descent.  Eric lets out
his breath and tries to swallow.  His mouth is as dry as the
granite.

<b>107  EXT.  TREELINE - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
Handcuffed again, Corbett hikes in front of Eric along the
top of some foothills.  Now and again he glances behind,
gauging Eric's weariness, waiting for a moment's
carelessness.  Around them there is heavy vegetation now --
snow-covered sedge tussocks, knee-deep muskeg and twisted
thickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through.
Above them, ominous clouds and sharp, cold winds are coming
down from the north.

But below, a mile ahead, the edge of the forest is like the
hem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward.
The combination of altitude and latitude creates an
amazingly sharp topographical dividing line.  Within a few

each other with six-foot-wide antlers.

<b>111  EXT.  FOREST - CAMPSITE PREPARATION MONTAGE - EVENING
</b>
The STORM brings gusting winds and below-zero temperatures.
Eric and Corbett move through the storm in slow motion.
Both recognize the need for a truce in the face of a common
enemy.  The snow and wind cut through their clothing like
razors.  They poke around for dead wood with which to make a
fire.  The trees are small and healthy; little is found.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttCORBETT
</b>ttt(shouts over WIND)
tttJust gather birch.  It'll smoke
tttlike hell, but it'll burn green.

Awestruck by the intensity of the storm, Eric tears branches
from birch trees and piles them in Corbett's handcuffed
arms.

They hurry back to the nylon tarp, strung between two tree
trunks, FLAPPING violently in the storm.  Hunching against
the wind, Eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in his
pocket for some precious matches.  His fingers are so cold
he can't hold them, and he drops several in the wet snow.

Angry, he shoots a look at Corbett. Corbett is holding his
hands inside his coat.  He pulls them out and quickly takes
the remaining matches from Eric.

Crouching down, back to the wind, Corbett grasps a match
between his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it.  He holds
the flame next to the kindling.  It doesn't catch fire
immediately.  Corbett lets the match burn out against his
fingers.  He tries another match.  This time, a flame takes
hold but could succumb to the wind at any moment.

On his knees and elbows, Corbett nurses along the tiny fire.
Eric can't control his shivering.  He gets on his knees next
to Corbett and holds his coat open to further baffle the
wind.  Corbett keeps his hands cupped around the flame, not

caring that it's burning his skin.  Finally the fire begins
to grow.  Relieved, Eric and Corbett look at each other with
a glimmer of a grudging mutual respect.

The fire, now unattended, is smoky as Corbett predicted, but
burns along nicely.

<b>112  EXT. / INT.  NYLON SHELTER - NIGHT
</b>
Corbett and Eric sit under the nylon shelter.  The STORM
rages outside.  Eric empties his pockets of Eskimo potato,
reindeer lichens, bistsort sorrel and other plants for his
dinner.

Corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree
branch, and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next
to a small animal burrow outside the shelter.  A squirrel
sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate.

Corbett sits catlike, ready to pounce.  Eric grimaces as
Corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrel's SQUEALS (OS)
abruptly cease.

Corbett pulls his dead dinner inside.

After a beat, Eric pulls open the small blade on his Swiss
Army knife and pushes it with his foot to Corbett.  Smiling,
Corbett admires the fancy knife.  Then, BELOW FRAME, he
skins and guts his catch.

Corbett eats the squirrel Eskimo-style.  Raw.  He uses the
knife like a native, too, holding the meat in his teeth,
then expertly cutting off a mouthful with a quick slice.
Eric stares, disgusted.  Off his look:

tttAlways eat your meat raw when the

Corbett uses snow and the squirrel's fur to wipe the blood
from his face, then wipes the knife off and lays it, open,
next to his leg.

With a wry smile, Corbett pushes it back over to Eric.

tttpair of pliers...

Suddenly, a BUMP rocks the Turtle.  Someone is outside.
Startled, Anne Marie turns the lights off and looks out the
window.

No sign of a vehicle or a person.  As she pulls on her
parka, she glances at the big rifle leaning against the
wall, but doesn't touch it.

<b>115  EXT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
Her visitor, whoever it is, is behind the Turtle.  Anne
Marie cautiously rounds the corner and stops dead.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
A foraging GRIZZLY sniffs around, attracted by the smell of
fresh carrion -- Wilder.  Eight feet tall and eleven-hundred
pounds, it's used to having its way.  Right now, it's
hungry.

With a casual swipe of its paw, its massive claws puncture
the Turtle's aluminum skin, popping open the door of the

utility compartment.  The bear pokes its head inside, and
Wilder's body slumps out into the snow.  The bear pushes at
the corpse with its snout.  Salivating, it prepares to dig
in.

Anne Marie looks around, wondering what the hell to do nEXT.
Wilder's snowmobile is a few yards behind her, parked
against the side of the Turtle.  She inches toward it.
Testily, the bear looks up, SNIFFING loudly.

Keeping her eyes on the bear, Anne Marie feels for the
snowmobile ignition keys.  They're not there.  She feels
around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road
flares.

Anne Marie IGNITES the flares.  They illuminate the area
with an eerie reddish glow.  She YELLS at the bear, wields
the flares like Excalibur and moves forward.

The bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernation
meal, GROWLS and cocks its head back and forth to assess the
threat.  As Anne Marie inches ahead, the bear stands on hind
legs to its full height to meet the challenge.
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tttttttt(CONTINUED)
</b><b>115  CONTINUED:

Anne Marie tosses a flare toward the bear.  It grunts when
the flare hits it, and shuffles backwards.  Anne Marie
throws another flare.  With a ROAR from hell, the bear
charges.  Anne Marie falls back.  Still holding the last
flare, she's forced into a crawl space under the Turtle.

<b>ANGLE - UNDER THE TURTLE
</b>
Anne Marie tries to squeeze out the other side, but she's
pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground.  The bear
swipes at her, its huge paw inches away.  Anne Marie jabs at
the paw with the flare, but that only makes the bear more
quarrelsome.

She twists around, looking for a defense.  Above her is the
cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the
Turtle's electrical system.  She tugs at it, but it won't
budge.  The bear SNIFFS at Anne Marie with its big wet
snout.  Anne Marie notices warning a sign on a control
valve:
<b>ttttt
</b><b>ttttt?  DANGER!!
</b><b>ttttt
</b><b>ttttt?  BLACK WATER
</b><b>ttttt
</b><b>ttttt?  UNTREATED SEWAGE
</b>
Grimacing, she tries to turn the valve.  After much effort,
it SNAPS and opens, releasing a stream of fetid sewage.

<b>WIDER
</b>
The bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff.  HOWLING
unhappily, it backs away, GRUNTING and SNEEZING.  Greatly
offended, its appetite gone, it lopes into the forest.

Anne Marie squirms out from under the Turtle and, gagging
from the horrible smell, pulls off her wet parka.

<b>116  EXT.  WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT
</b>
Wearing one of Eric's coats, Anne Marie stands in the center
of three similarly-sized trees.  A FLARE supplies the light.
The big Remington rifle leans against the tree closest to
her.

She tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a
sturdy tree branch twenty-five feet from the ground.  Then
she throws the other end over an opposing branch and
stretches the rope like a clothesline.
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tttttttt(CONTINUED)
</b><b>116  CONTINUED:
</b>
She attaches a second length of rope perpendicular to the
first and throws it over a third tree branch, midway between
the other two.  She kneels and ties something BELOW FRAME to
the cross-length rope.

Pulling mightily on the perpendicular rope, she hoists
something heavy to the level of the branches.  The flare
burns out, plunging the area into darkness.

Anne Marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk and
nervously tries to LIGHT another flare.  As she does, the
forest seems closer, sinister, filled with lurking ogres.
Seized with an instinctual fear, she grabs the rifle and
runs back to the Turtle.

The storm has passed, leaving a fresh covering of powdery
snow in drifts like sand dunes.  Eric and Corbett trek
toward Devil's Cauldron through the ever-thickening forest.
Corbett has made them snow goggles by cutting slits in
strips of tree bark worn like sunglasses.  Eric, using a
tree branch as a walking stick, still limps on his sore
ankle.  For the first time, he keeps the magnum stuck in his
waistband.

Corbett takes advantage of Eric's poor peripheral vision
from the visor by kneeing Eric in the face.  Eric falls
backwards into the snow.  Corbett takes off like a
jackrabbit.  Eric spits out some blood, shakes the stars out
of his eyes and yanks the .357 from under his coat.

Corbett zigzags and disappears from sight over a snowbank.

<b>NEW ANGLE - FOLLOW CORBETT

Corbett runs over a frozen stream, invisible under a cover
of snow.  Suddenly, the ice SHATTERS under him.  Corbett is
immersed in frigid, waist-deep water.  He gasps from the
sudden temperature drop.

hobbles after him, CUSSING bitterly to himself.

crawls to solid ground.  Disoriented from the shock to his
system, he rolls over to catch his breath.

Eric appears over a snowbank.

Corbett tries to run, but his frozen, waterlogged legs feel
like pig iron.  Stumbling and panting, he looks for a safe
place to cross the stream.  Eric easily catches up to him.
Corbett sits in the snow, shivering.  He looks up as Eric
trots over.

Eric glares at Corbett and rubs the bruise on his cheek.

Corbett is headed someplace far away.  Sighing, Eric turns
him so his back faces the fire.  He unbuttons Corbett's

Eric gasps -- Corbett feels like a slab of ice.  Corbett's

still warm, etc.  The emptiness is ominous.  LeMalle picks
up the big Remington bear rifle.  He opens the breech to
determine if it's loaded, and sniffs the barrel to see if

LeMalle goes outside and shines his flashlight around.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
In the back, Anne Marie drags an evergreen tree branch
behind her to cover her tracks in the snow, then climbs into
the utility compartment where Wilder's body was stored.

A moment later, LeMalle comes around the corner.  He notices
bear tracks and scat from the prior night's visit.

tttGrizzly sign.  Looks fresh.

Viking Bob and Mitchell converge with LeMalle.  They point
their flashlights around, spotting footprints and marks
going off into the woods.

<b>129  EXT.  WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE
</b>
Tense and silent, the trappers follow the marks.  A breeze
RUSTLES the needles of the evergreens around them.  They
stop at the point the footprints end.  A rhythmic CREAKING
above them makes LeMalle shine his light upward.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The light REVEALS Wilder's feet swinging back and forth
above their heads.  His body is suspended in the manner of a
trail cache.  Viking Bob lets out a startled grunt.  He and
Mitchell shine their lights on Wilder's face.

Anne Marie jams herself behind a pile of her photo
equipment.  She stops as she hears the trappers' boots (OS)
CRUNCH in the snow past her and go inside the Turtle.

The trappers peel off their overcoats.  They look around at
the comfortable surroundings.

He sits on the couch and lays his scrimshaw and engraving
tools out on the coffee table.  LeMalle helps himself in the
well-stocked larder.

Flashlight in hand, gloriously drunk, LeMalle stumbles
outside.  He crosses to the jeep to grab a box of Twinkies
and, as long as he's at it, take a leak in a snowbank.
Bleary-eyed, he notices the damage to the utility
compartment inflicted by the bear.

He walks to it, stepping over the bear scat.  He marvels at
the size and depth of the clawmarks.

LeMalle tries the door, but it's jammed shut.  He tucks his
flashlight under his arm and gives another tug.  This time
the door cracks open.

<b>CLOSER - HIS POV
</b>
He peers through the opening and shines his flashlight in.
A pair of eyes stare back at him.

<b>WIDER
</b>
LeMalle jumps back, startled, and pulls out his knife.   He
tries the door again.  It WRENCHES open...

...He's looking at his own face in one of Anne Marie's
mirrored photo reflector boards.

Letting his breath out, LeMalle pokes around the equipment
in the compartment.  Ever larcenous, he pulls a few items
out, examines them, and, disinterested, leaves them in the
snow.  Doing so, he comes close to uncovering Anne Marie,
who sits motionless and terrified in the back of the
compartment.

Nothing in the compartment catches LeMalle's fancy.  Leaving
the door hanging open, he wanders away.

<b>133  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE

After he's gone, Anne Marie reaches over and closes the
door.  She can hear the trappers' (OS) CONVERSATION inside:

takes a tentative nibble.

Eric smashes his fist into Corbett's face.  Corbett reels
back, more surprised than hurt.  Eric moves in, furiously
throwing punches.  Corbett plows his clenched fists into
Eric's midsection, doubling him over.  Gasping, Eric rams
his head into Corbett and they fall into the snow.

Despite the handcuffs, Corbett gets a few blows in.  They
wrestle fiercely, and Eric ends up on top of Corbett.  He's
about to throw another punch when Corbett looks up at him.

Eric lowers his fist and climbs off of Corbett.  Corbett
gets up and they continue on their way in sullen silence.

<b>135  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAY
</b>
Sunday morning.  Chimney smoke rises straight up in the
still morning air and mingles with the wisps of fog hanging
above the Devil's Cauldron valley.

A scratchy RECORDING of a HYMN ("We Will Gather at the
River") plays through a PA system, ECHOING forlornly off the
hills.  The PEOPLE of Devil's Cauldron walk through the new
snow to the center of the settlement.  Some, older Women
mostly, head for the dance hall, where the HYMN originates.

<b>136  INT.  DANCE HALL
</b>
The Women SING along with the HYMN.  They face a shelf
holding the PA, a rusty TV and record player.  And, in front
of the shelf, an unmanned pulpit.

The Men, including Neff, split off from their mates and go
into the Maqi.

Neff joins some other Men sweating on benches in the
primitive steam bath.   Kenai sits closest to the fire.  His

Exhausted, Corbett and Eric climb across the last set of
foothills before the Devil's Cauldron valley.  The town
comes into view below them; faintly the MUSIC carries from
below.  Corbett looks at Eric and breaks the silence:

LeMalle carries his booty with him.  Viking Bob looks at him
disapprovingly as he puts the big Remington rifle in the
jeep.

To demonstrate, he rapid-fires several SHOTS from the hip,
taking the radio antenna off the roof of the Turtle,
shattering panes of glass in an accurate succession, and
blasting the door latch off the utility compartment.

LeMalle climbs into the back of the jeep.  With Viking Bob
driving, they pull away.

<b>141  EXT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)

Grinning maliciously, LeMalle hangs the Remington out the
window as they retreat.  Taking careful aim, he SHOOTS.

<b>142  EXT.  THE TURTLE
</b>
LeMalle's bullet hits the metal fuel tank of the generator.
The kerosene fumes EXPLODE, splattering BURNING KEROSENE on
the rear module of the Turtle.

The trappers don't slow down to enjoy the show.  Viking Bob
hurries on to more important business.

<b>143  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE

As soon as the SOUND of the jeep fades away, Anne Marie
clambers out of the utility compartment.  Haggard and numb
with cold, she helplessly watches as the fire ravenously
devours the rear module.  Shielding her face from the
flames, Anne Marie reaches under the accordion cover between
the modules.  With great effort, she unbolts the coupling
bracket.

<b>144  INT.  DIESEL RIG - THE TURTLE

Anne Marie STARTS the engine, SLAMS it into gear, and
lurches the front module away from the burning rear module.
She shuts the motor off and, trying to hold back the tears,
watches the rear module BURNING.

Bone weary, Eric and Corbett walk toward town, staying on
the outskirts to avoid being seen.  They look at one another
-- this moment seemed impossible not very long ago.  No one
seems to notice as they limp into Wilder's cabin.



<b>146  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN

It's dark.  Eric locks Corbett up in the holding cell, not
noticing that Corbett seems almost pleased to be there.  He
blocks the windows, pumps up the pressure on the white gas
lantern and heads back outside again.

The temperature dips as the winds shifts and blows down from
the north.  Another storm approaches.  The temperate days of
last week seem ages ago.

Kenai, Neff, and other TOWNSMEN batten Devil's Cauldron down
for the STORM.  Kenai is bundled up in the cold.  The men
tighten guy wires on the radio tower, windmills and caches;
bring firewood indoors; close off unused rooms in the
general store and spa.  Then Neff and Kenai split off from
the others.

Via a catwalk, Neff and Kenai climb up into the ceiling
struts above the partitioned cubicles in the spa to caulk a

Outside the wind HOWLS.  Eric enters and walks into the
hallway connecting the bath partitions.  A hand grabs his
arm.  Startled, he turns around.

It's Dixie, wearing a threadbare flannel robe.
<b>ttttt

Eric shakes his head -- typical Kenai.  He gives her three

It's actually a bath partition outfitted with an examining
table and a first-aid kit.

Kenai tugs on the drawer.  It's locked.  Undaunted, he
jimmies it open with a knife.  Neff groans.  Kenai goes to
throw Corbett the duffel bag, but Neff grabs it.  He checks
for weapons, pulling out a hunting knife.  Satisfied, he
hands Corbett the bag through the bars.

With his free hand, Corbett digs through his belongings:
clothing, freeze-dried provisions, jerky, paperback books.
He looks up and shrugs.

Eric's ankle is in a resin cast.  His foot rests on a stool.
While waiting for the cast to set he soaks in the bathtub, a
hot towel draped over his face.  Above him, on a wall
bracket, a closed circuit TV plays a war-surplus PORNO FILM.

The door CREAKS open and Dixie comes in.  She impassively
checks his cast -- which is interesting, as she's now
wearing panties, clog shoes and nothing else.  Eric takes
the towel off his face and sits up, astonished.

sixty miles southeast of Devil's Cauldron.

With the seats pushed back, LeMalle peels the town's lone
WHORE out of her parka.  He's got the motor running for
warmth.  Her gold tooth glints in the light from the
building next to them.  The locating screen on the beat-up
radio beacon receiver bolted to the dash GLOWS
phosphorescent green.

LeMalle's shoulder at the locating device.

Kenai sorts through the tangle of Corbett's traps.   The
door bursts open and Eric hobbles in.  Gun drawn, Eric
unlocks the cell door.  He rips Corbett's shirt open.
Looking around, he sees Corbett's duffel bag sitting by the
cot.  Digging through it, he finds at the bottom of the bag
an ELT with a small red LED flashing on it.

Furious, he flings it against the wall, smashing it.

Fat, dry snowflakes pour through the still air.  Gloomy
clouds hang immediately overhead.  Visibility is ten feet;
the temperature is below zero.

<b>162  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN
</b>
It's 5:30 AM.  Sitting at Wilder's desk, Eric pries the tops
from some bullets and dumps the gunpowder into a styrofoam
cup. He rings the top of the cup with bluetip matches, then
seals it with masking tape.  Watching him from the cell,
Corbett smiles.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttCORBETT
</b>tttFlashbomb, eh?

Eric doesn't answer.  He pulls on a heavy overcoat of
Wilder's.  Putting the unused bullets back in Wilder's desk,
Eric finds Corbett's .44 magnum.  He puts it and some
speedloaders full of .357 hollowpoints in his pockets.

<b>163  EXT. / INT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - MONTAGE
</b>
Eric hobbles across town to the hot springs under cover of
the early hour and heavy snowfall.  He paces out several
circuitous routes from the rental cabins to the airstrip at
the edge of town, pausing now and again along the way.

He hears a door SQUEAK open and someone COUGH nearby, so he
stands motionless in the snow.

Bundled in wool blankets, Kenai trundles down to his
outhouse.

After Kenai passes by, Eric sneaks inside the spa.  He
climbs up into the catwalk.

As Kenai goes back to his cabin, he notices that the antique
bear traps on display in front of the general store are
missing.  Suddenly, Eric grabs him and pulls him into the
spa doorway.

Outside, there is the high-pitched WHINE of a snowmobile
(OS) driving into town.  Eric cautiously follows the SOUND.

<b>165  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - CLOSE ON ERIC

He listens as the vehicle cuts across town toward Neff's
house.  The snowfall is too thick to see who it is.  Eric

A person in a hooded parka stands on Neff's stoop, about to
knock.  Magnum drawn, Eric suddenly appears from the curtain
of falling snow.  He shoves the person against the side of
the house.

It's Anne Marie.  She gasps.  Seeing Eric, she's more angry
than relieved.  Eric puts the gun back in his waistband.

This comment has the intended effect on Anne Marie.  Angry,
Eric throws Corbett a coat.  Corbett puts it on.  Reaching
through the bars, Eric cuffs Corbett's hands together.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttWe're moving.  Let's go.

As they exit, Corbett's sardonic look makes Anne Marie
shiver.

<b>168  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
The ten-by-ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots, a
beat-up color TV set, a cookstove and a half-drum heat
stove.  Built into the rear wall is a rustic dumb waiter
that once lowered perishables into the icy waters of a
now-dry stream.

Eric checks his watch.  6:15 AM.  He bolts the door and
blocks the windows, opening one enough to let sound in from
outside.  He extinguishes the Benman lantern and douses the
fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the
chimney.  Anne Marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb
waiter.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttYou'll catch a chill by that dumb

Anne Marie reluctantly takes the huge gun.  Trying to allay
her fears, Eric sits and brushes the hair from her face.
Corbett intently watches them.  Before he can say anything,
Eric shoots him a cold look.  Corbett stays quiet.

<b>169  EXT. / INT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

A pall hangs over the town.  People know to stay inside.
Time crawls by.

In his house, Neff, for once, has his TV turned off.  He
tries to read and listens for sounds outside.

In the spa, water DRIPS somewhere.  All the stalls are
empty.

In his sod house, Kenai looks out his one tiny window at the
curtain of snow.  Dixie comes up behind him and puts her
hands on his shoulders.  He looks up at her, glum.

In Wilder's empty cabin, his belongings are scattered about
as if expecting his imminent return.

In the rental cabin, Eric checks his watch.  10:45 AM.

<b>170  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR WILDER'S CABIN - DAY
</b>
The sound of a MOTOR grows in volume, then abruptly ceases.
The trappers' jeep APPEARS in the snowfall on the road into
town.  It coasts quietly in and stops behind the cover of a
woodpile across from Wilder's cabin.

The trappers get out of the jeep.  LeMalle has Eric's
Remington, Mitchell has his Peacemaker, and Viking Bob
carries LeMalle's old carbine.  Mitchell spits.  It's so
cold outside that the spittle freezes and CRACKS before it
hits the ground.

They fan out and approach Wilder's cabin.

<b>ANGLE WITH TRAPPERS
</b>
The cabin comes more clearly into view as the trappers move
closer.  There is no sign of life.  Viking Bob gestures for
the others, now positioned on either side of the cabin, to
crouch down for cover.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttVIKING BOB
</b>ttt(calls out)
tttBen?  Ben Corbett?

No response.  Carbine held at his hip, Viking Bob walks up
to the door and, with a mighty kick, BREAKS it in.

Viking Bob points the carbine at an empty room.  He notices,
however, Corbett's duffel bag on the floor of the cell.

<b>171  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON
</b>
The trappers march through town like an advancing army,
looking for some sign of Corbett.  LeMalle stops to dig
through his pockets for some food.  All he comes up with is
the stump of a candy bar.  Viking Bob looks at him
impatiently.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttVIKING BOB
</b>tttLook, we pull Ben's ass out of
tttthe fire, I'll get you a whole
tttdamn crate of Snickers bars.
<b>ttttt

</b>ttt(insulted)
tttI'm right fuckin' here with you.

To prove his point, LeMalle trots from dwelling to dwelling,
looking through windows and letting himself in through any
unlocked door.  This proves fruitless, so he lets out a
frustrated YELL.  Pointing the Remington skyward, he lets
off a couple thunderous SHOTS that ECHO back off the
foothills.

<b>172  INT.  RENTAL CABIN
</b>
Hearing the shots, Eric pushes Anne Marie against the floor.
Cautioning her to stay put, he crawls to the window and
tries to see through the snowfall.  After a moment of
silence, from outside, not too far away:
<b>ttttt

The trappers are obviously much closer.  Eric signals to
Corbett not to answer.

Eric and Corbett face the window.  They don't notice as Anne

gasping as he realizes she's gone.  Corbett smiles
sardonically.

some of her photo gear from the snowmobile.

<b>180  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

With a camera bag slung over her shoulder, Anne Marie climbs
up the metal antenna tower behind Neff's house on the edge
of town. She grits her teeth and fights back a wave of
vertigo. The ground disappears from sight, hidden by the
snow and fog.

Fifty feet up, she attaches her infrared video camera to the
tower crossbars and, using a length of coaxial cable, hooks
its RF output to the feedline of the community TV antenna.

Anne Marie crouches behind a tree, twenty feet behind
LeMalle.  After a moment, she tiptoes back toward the rental
cabin.

<b>184  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Eric and Corbett turn as Anne Marie's camera bag suddenly
drops from the dumb waiter shaft.  Anne Marie wriggles back
inside.  Before Eric can say anything, she puts her fingers
over his mouth.  She turns on the TV set and tunes it to
channel 3.

<b>ANGLE ON TV
</b>
A fuzzy IMAGE comes into view.  It's Devil's Cauldron from
the vantage of Anne Marie's infrared video camera.  The
falling snow shows up as a translucent yellow wash over the
scene.  Buildings are distinguishable as bluish silhouettes.
Heat-producing objects -- warm walls, chimney smoke, etc. --
are pink and red.  And there are three clearly-definable
human figures standing near the Maqi.  The trappers.

Corbett is amazed.  Eric smiles at Anne Marie.

He digs through Anne Marie's bag of equipment and supplies,
then stops and looks up.  Outside, there is an OS SOUND that
is felt before it is HEARD.  The cargo PLANE approaches in
the distance.

Eric quietly pulls the door open.  Holding the pistol to
Corbett's head, he pushes Corbett out in front of him.

Anne Marie and Eric exchange a long look.  Fighting back
tears, she reaches up and touches his face.

and slinks away in the other direction, toward the dance
hall.

dirt and SCUFFS his feet in it.

The trappers turn to the SOUND, heard under the RUMBLE of
the still-distant plane.  Converging, they head in that

Eric SHOOTS a couple times, then backtracks and pulls
Corbett behind one of the rental cabins.

Eric pushes Corbett through a narrow pass between two
buildings in the center of town.  He walks in Corbett's
footprints.  Almost through to the other side, he suddenly
stops.  Pulling Corbett with him, Eric walks backwards,
still carefully placing each foot in an existing footprINT.
Corbett can't help but smile.

The TV PICTURE disappears as the power dies.  Anne Marie

Eric and Corbett emerge from between the buildings.  Eric
backtracks toward the hot springs spa, now leaving an

Eric and Corbett go inside.  Eric pulls the door closed
behind them, but leaves it ajar.

The big 4-prop plane is about to touch down on the far side
of the snow-covered airstrip.

Anne Marie zips up her parka and cautiously goes outside.

<b>197  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

LeMalle follows the footprints to the door Eric left ajar.
He peers inside.

<b>198  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
It's tomb-quiet except for water DRIPPING and pipes
CREAKING.  LeMalle looks around.  The sound of a small DING
against metal above him gets his attention.

He sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him.
He finds a metal ladder, slings his rifle over his shoulder
and climbs up.  Hearing another SOUND on the far side of the
catwalk, he hurries across, holding onto the pipes for
balance.

LeMalle is directly above the huge central pool.  He ducks
to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling
to a dark corner below.  Suddenly, the twine snaps tight,
pulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling.  The door
swings down and knocks LeMalle off the catwalk.  With a
yelp, he splashes into the water below.

<b>NEW ANGLE

Hidden in the shadows, Eric drops the end of the twine and
rushes toward the front door with Corbett in tow.

climbs out of the central pool, soaked.   He pulls his wet
jacket off and furiously throws it down.



<b>199  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Eric leads Corbett around the back of the spa.  A GUNSHOT
rings out nearby and a BULLET hits the wall above Eric's
head.

<b>MITCHELL
</b>
has seen their faint silhouettes through the snow.  He
purposely SHOOTS over their heads so he doesn't hit Corbett.

<b>ANGLE BEHIND HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Eric and Corbett crouch down and double back.   They are
once again swallowed up by the snowfall.

<b>200  EXT.  ALLEY
</b>
Viking Bob follows their footprints in between the
buildings.  He continues to a point where they converge to
one set, then stop.  He smiles at the naivete of Eric's
ploy.  Looking at the boardwalk railing above, he assumes
Eric and Corbett have swung over it onto the iced-over
boardwalk.  Pleased with his deduction, Viking Bob continues
along the alley.

SNAP!  Viking Bob lets out a horrible HOWL and falls on his
back in the snow.  Biting into his right calf is a huge
conibear leg trap.  In extreme pain, he struggles to lever
it open with the barrel of his rifle.

<b>201  EXT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE

Corbett shoots Eric a dangerous look as Viking Bob's CRIES
carry though the town.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttERIC
</b>tttHe'll live.

<b>202  EXT.  ALLEY
</b>
Hearing Viking Bob's cries, Mitchell backtracks and rushes
to Viking Bob's aid.  Between them, they manage to yawn open
the jaws of the trap and free Viking Bob's leg.  Viking Bob
tries to walk but the leg won't support him -- the bone is
broken.  Bitterly frustrated, he waves Mitchell on.  In
agony, Viking Bob eases down in the snow.  He tears a strip
of lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the
bleeding.

<b>203  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA
</b>
Anne Marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip.
Suddenly, the hot springs door bursts open and LeMalle
lunges at her.  Stripped of his wet clothes, he's wrapped
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tttttttt(CONTINUED)
</b><b>203  CONTINUED:
</b>
in blankets and furs, his feet protected by sacks lashed to
them.  His wet body and hair steams in the frigid air.

Anne Marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from
him.  She falls hard on her back, knocking her wind out.
Scrambling for footing in the snow, LeMalle drops his rifle.
He comes at her again.  Anne Marie moves away and pulls the
.44 magnum out.  LeMalle stops and glares at her.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttANNE MARIE
</b>ttt(gasping)
tttDon't make me shoot.

She gets up, keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him.
LeMalle glowers menacingly.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttANNE MARIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
tttWe're going to Sam's cabin.  You
tttcan stay in the jail until this

LeMalle slowly crouches down for his rifle.  Anne Marie
wields the handgun at him, but he doesn't stop.
<b>ttttt

</b>tttWant to chance it with that
ttthog-leg?  You can't even hold it
tttup.  Better drop me first shot,
tttbitch, or I'll rip your fuckin'

Taunting, sneering, LeMalle stares her down.  Anne Marie is
paralyzed.  Feeling that he's won, LeMalle wraps his bony
fingers around the stock of the Remington.

Anne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES.  Pulling the rifle
close, LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet.  Anne
Marie FIRES again, and AGAIN.  Shot, LeMalle hobbles away,
leaving a trail of blood in the snow.  Numb, Anne Marie lets
her arm fall.

<b>204  EXT.  BOARDWALK NEAR WILDER'S CABIN

Eric looks around at the sound of the shooting, fearing the
worst.  He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cut
across open ground toward the airstrip depot.

Kenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalle's
ransacking for things to wear.  Kenai turns, startled, when
he hears footsteps.  It's Neff and Meyerling.

<b>206  EXT.  YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOT

Through the snow, Eric can see the faint outline of the
plane on the runway.  He and Corbett hurry toward the back
of the airstrip depot.

As they wend their way through the junk-filled yards, Eric
catches a glimpse of movement around a corner, REFLECTED in
a pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper.

<b>ERIC'S POV - REFLECTION

Peacemaker in hand, Mitchell is behind the depot, coming
right for them.

<b>WIDER

Eric takes out the homemade flashbomb.  He lights it, tosses
it toward Mitchell and covers his eyes.  It EXPLODES with a
muffled pop and a bright flash of white light.

Mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes.  The flash
has temporarily clouded his vision.

Eric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot and
waits for Mitchell to move on.

<b>207  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
Mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his
shoulder stops him.  It's LeMalle, oblivious to the profuse
bleeding from his right shoulder.  Mitchell blinks, still
having trouble seeing.  LeMalle gestures for him to be quiet
and points in Eric and Corbett's direction.

But LeMalle is too anxious.  He swings the rifle up,
left-handed, and SHOOTS.

The bullet just misses Eric.  He panics and wildly returns
FIRE with the .357.

as they HEAR LeMalle's labored footsteps run past them,

depot.  There is no further movement.

Eric waits a moment, then leads Corbett cautiously toward
the depot.

<b>209  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
Reaching the rear wall, they practically stumble over
something.  It's Mitchell, lying on the ground near the
wall, badly wounded by Eric's barrage.  Eric gasps.
Anguished, Corbett kneels next to Mitchell.  Mitchell pulls
him closer.

</b><b>tttttMITCHELL
</b>tttGlad to see you're okay.  I told
tttLeMalle not to shoot.
ttt(tries to smile)
tttHad some fine seasons, didn't

Mitchell's grasp on Corbett's coat relaxes as he dies.
Horrified, Eric stares at the man he killed.  Noticing the
scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from Mitchell's
pocket, Corbett picks it up.
<b>ttttt
</b><b>tttttCORBETT

tttFifteen years on the trail with

pulls back.

tttYour first kill.  How does it

Wiping his face, sickened and desolate, Eric has no reply.

Then, from somewhere close by, LeMalle FIRES at them.  Eric
stuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the
padlock off the back door of the depot.  He pushes Corbett
inside.



<b>210  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT

Shaking his head and muttering, the Pilot unfastens his seat
belt, climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment,
and obliges the little lady with the big gun.



<b>212  INT.  AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</b>
The depot, as temporary-looking as the rest of Devil's
Cauldron, is a boxcar-shaped loading dock and warehouse with
a corrugated steel roof.  Boxes, wood palettes and hand
dollies are piled haphazardly about.

Eric and Corbett navigate through the piles of boxes,
inching toward the front door -- the door leading to the
plane.

Suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on.  Eric goes
for the .357, then stops when he sees Meyerling, Kenai and
Neff have come in the front door.  Kenai stomps his feet and
shivers.  Grandstanding for the others, Meyerling steps
forward.

Kenai and Neff move in with Meyerling.  Eric stands his
ground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Suddenly, LeMalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and
furs dragging at his feet.  His right side is bathed in
blood.  Half-frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down
dead.  In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the
massive Remington.

He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a
round into the chamber with his injured right arm.  Bracing
himself, he levels the rifle at Eric.

Hearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns.

Corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his
handcuffed hands, and hurls it.

There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges.

LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear
stuck clear through his chest.

Some packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited by
the muzzle blast.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
There is a moment of silence.  Corbett looks at the other
weapons near him, and then at Meyerling.  Threatened,
Meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic.  Before Eric can do
anything, Meyerling FIRES.

The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes.

With a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his

scrambles to his feet with Meyerling's gun in his hand.

Eric and Anne Marie watch from the door of the plane as
Corbett limps across the runway toward the treeline.  As he
goes, his footprints are dusted over by the snow and wind.

Corbett stops, turns and looks back at Eric, then continues
onward, disappearing into the forest.

<b>ANGLE ON CARGO PLANE
</b>
Eric closes the cargo door as the Pilot turns the plane
around and taxis back down the runway.

<b>219  INT.  CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
Eric wearily sits next to Anne Marie.  She kisses him.

The Pilot glances over his shoulder and frowns.

<b>220  INT.  CARGO PLANE - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)
</b>
The plane climbs above the fog and snow clouds into a sunny,
ice blue sky.  It banks and turns south.  Behind it, the
mountains roll on toward the Arctic wasteland, forever.
