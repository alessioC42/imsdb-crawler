<b>EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH
</b>
A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots 
from its underside.  

One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-
covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of
impact.  

<b>EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY
</b>
A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A 
strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the 
smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the 
snow plain and disappears into the distance.

<b>EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY
</b>
A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled 
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving 
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged 
beast.

The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling 
off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the 
sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and 
through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.

The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink 
transmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttEcho Three to Echo Seven.  Han, 
ttold buddy, do you read me?

After a little static a familiar voice is heard.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(over comlink)
ttLoud and clear, kid.  What's up?

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttWell, I finished my circle.  I 
ttdon't pick up any life readings.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(over comlink)
ttThere isn't enough life on this 
ttice cube to fill a space cruiser.  
ttThe sensors are placed, I'm going 
ttback.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttRight.  I'll see you shortly.  
ttThere's a meteorite that hit the 
ttground near here.  I want to check 
ttit out.  It won't take long.

Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.  
He pats the beast on the head to calm it.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttHey, steady girl.  What's the 
ttmatter?  You smell something?

Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when 
suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a 
monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over 
him.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttAaargh!

Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white 
claw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified 
screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck 
being broken.

The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away 
across the frozen plain.

<b>EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY
</b>
A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous 
ice cave.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK
</b>
Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing 
their new base.  The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls 
off his goggles.

He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which 
is parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various 
other droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his 
Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter.  Chewie 
stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated 
greeting to his boss.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttChewie!

The Wookiee grumbles a reply.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttAll right, don't lose your temper.
ttI'll come right back and give you 
tta hand.

Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han 
leaves.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
A makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick 
ice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers, 
troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and 
monitoring radar signals.

General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach.

<b>ttttRIEEKAN
</b>ttSolo?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.  You'll 
know if anything comes around.

<b>ttttRIEEKAN
</b>ttCommander Skywalker reported in yet?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttNo.  He's checking out a meteorite 
ttthat hit near him.

<b>ttttRIEEKAN
</b>ttt(indicates radar 
ttt screen)
ttWith all the meteor activity in this
ttsystem, it's going to be difficult 
ttto spot approaching ships.

Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttGeneral, I've got to leave.  I 
ttcan't stay anymore.

Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short 
white combat jacket and pants.  Her hair is braided across her head in 
a Nordic fashion.  She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat 
distressed.

<b>ttttRIEEKAN
</b>ttI'm sorry to hear that.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWell, there's a price on my head.
ttIf I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, 
ttI'm a dead man.

<b>ttttRIEEKAN
</b>ttA death mark's not an easy thing 
ttto live with.  You're a good
ttfighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThank you, General.

He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(with feeling)
ttWell, Your Highness, I guess this 
ttis it.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttThat's right.

Leia is angry.  Han sees she has no warmth to offer him.  He shakes his 
head and adopts a sarcastic tone.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(cooly)
ttWell, don't get all mushy on me.
ttSo long, Princess.

Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center.  
Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR
</b>
<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttHan!

Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYes, Your Highnessness?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI thought you decided to stay.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWell, the bounty hunter we ran 
ttinto on Ord Mantell changed my
ttmind.  

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttHan, we need you!

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWe?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttOh, what about you need?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(mystified)
ttI need?  I don't know what you're 
tttalking about.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(shakes his head, 
ttt fed up) 
ttYou probably don't.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttAnd what precisely am I supposed 
ttto know?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttCome on!  You want me to stay 
ttbecause of the way you feel about
ttme.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttYes.  You're a great help to us.
ttYou're a natural leader...

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttNo!  That's not it.  Come on.  
ttAahhh - uh huh!  Come on.

Leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>You're imagining things.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttAm I?  Then why are you following 
ttme?  Afraid I was going to leave
ttwithout giving you a goodbye kiss?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI can arrange that.  You could use 
tta good kiss!

Angrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR
</b>
A familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo-
Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an 
ice wall toward the main hangar.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttDon't try to blame me.  I didn't 
ttask you to turn on the thermal 
ttheater.  I merely commented that it 
ttwas freezing in the princess' 
ttchamber.  But it's supposed to be 
ttfreezing.  How are we going to dry 
ttout all her clothes?  I really don't 
ttknow.

Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh, switch off.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK
</b>
The two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter.  Han and Chewie are 
struggling with their central lifters.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(to Chewie)
ttWhy do you take this apart now? 
ttI'm trying to get us out of here 
ttand you pull both of these.

Chewie grumbles in irritation.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttExcuse me, sir.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(to Chewie)
ttPut them back together right now.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttMight I have a word with you, 
ttplease?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWhat do you want?

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttWell, it's Princess Leia, sir.
ttShe's been trying to get you on 
ttthe communicator.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI turned it off.  I don't want to 
tttalk to her.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering 
ttabout Master Luke.  He hasn't come 
ttback yet.  She doesn't know where he 
ttis.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI don't know where he is.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttNobody knows where he is.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWhat do you mean, "nobody knows"?

Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as 
night slowly begins to fall on the planet.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttWell, uh, you see...

Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttDeck Officer.  Deck Officer!

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttExcuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...

Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer 
approaches.

<b>ttttDECK OFFICER
</b>ttYes, sir?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttDo you know where Commander 
ttSkywalker is?

<b>ttttDECK OFFICER
</b>ttI haven't seen him.  It's possible 
tthe came in through the south entrance.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttIt's possible?  Why don't you go 
ttfind out?  It's getting dark out there.

<b>ttttDECK OFFICER
</b>ttYes, sir.

The deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's 
mouth.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttExcuse me, sir.  Might I inquire 
ttwhat's going on?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWhy not?

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttImpossible man.  Come along, Artoo, 
ttlet's find Princess Leia.  Between 
ttourselves, I think Master Luke is 
ttin considerable danger.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL
</b>
The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the 
tunnel.

<b>ttttDECK OFFICER
</b>ttSir, Commander Skywalker hasn't 
ttcome in through the south entrance.
ttHe might have forgotten to check in.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttNot likely.  Are the speeders ready?

<b>ttttDECK OFFICER
</b>ttNot yet.  We're having some trouble 
ttadapting them to the cold.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThen we'll have to go out on 
ttTauntauns.

<b>ttttDECK OFFICER
</b>ttSir, the temperature's dropping too 
ttrapidly.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThat's right.  And my friends out 
ttin it.

<b>ttttASSISTANT OFFICER
</b>ttI'll cover sector twelve.  Have 
ttcom-control set screen alpha.

Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.

<b>ttttDECK OFFICER
</b>ttYour Tauntaun'll freeze before you 
ttreach the first marker.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThen I'll see you in hell!

Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter 
night.

<b>EXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK
</b>
The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of 
a Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy 
stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One 
side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens 
his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the 
gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and 
futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.

Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there, 
he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about 
three feet out of reach.

He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he 
squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.

Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into 
Luke's hand.

The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts 
himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The 
startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke 
scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams 
in pain.

<b>EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK
</b>
Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight.  Weak 
and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.

<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK
</b>
A small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile 
vastness of snow and cold.  As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up 
large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.

<b>EXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICEtttt HANGAR - DUSK
</b>
Artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.  Threepio moves 
stiffly over to him.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttYou must come along now, Artoo.  
ttThere's really nothing more we can 
ttdo.  And my joints are freezing up.

Artoo beeps, long and low.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttDon't say thing like that!  Of 
ttcourse we'll see Master Luke again.
ttHe'll be quite all right, you'll see.
ttt(to himself)
ttStupid little short-circuit.  He'll 
ttbe quite all right.

Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully 
keeps his vigil.

<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK
</b>
The wind is blowing quite strong now.  Luke struggles to stay upright, 
but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over.  He struggles to get up, 
but he can't.  The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple 
of feet and then collapses.

<b>INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</b>
Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base, 
waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes.  She shivers in the cold 
wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands.  In the 
background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors.  

A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with 
the princess.

<b>ttttLIEUTENANT
</b>ttSir, all the patrols are in.
ttThere's still no contact from 
ttSkywalker or Solo.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttMistress Leia, Artoo says he's been 
ttquite unable to pick up any signals, 
ttalthough he does admit that his own 
ttrange is far too weak to abandon 
ttall hope.

Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.

<b>ttttDERLIN
</b>ttYour Highness, there's nothing 
ttmore we can do tonight.  The shield 
ttdoors must be closed.

He turns to the lieutenant.

<b>ttttDERLIN
</b>ttClose the doors.

<b>ttttLIEUTENANT
</b>ttYes, sir.

The lieutenant walks away.  Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, 
somewhat like a coyote.  At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex 
series of efficient beeps.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttArtoo says the chances of survival 
ttare seven hundred seventy-five...
ttto one.

Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the 
entrance of the ice cave.  The loud booms echo throughout the huge 
cavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttActually, Artoo has been known to 
ttmake mistakes... from time to time.
ttOh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry 
ttabout Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll 
ttbe all right.  He's quite clever, 
ttyou know... for a human being.

<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK
</b>
Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.  Slowly he looks 
up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.  It is 
hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttLuke... Luke.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(weakly)
ttBen?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou will go to the Dagobah system.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttDagobah system?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThere you will learn from Yoda, 
ttthe Jedi Master who instructed me.

The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching 
from the windswept horizon.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(groaning faintly)
ttBen... Ben.

Luke drops into unconsciousness.

Han pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered 
friend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low, 
pitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him 
urgently.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttLuke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.  
ttCome on, give me a sign here.

Luke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping 
Luke's unconscious face.  As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a 
rasping sound behind him.  He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun 
stagger and then fall over into the snow.

Han carries Luke to the moaning beast.  Then, with a final groan, the 
Tauntaun expires.

<b>ttttHAN 
</b>ttNot much time.

He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(moaning)
ttBen... Ben...

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttHang on, kid.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttDagobah system...

Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe.  He 
quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's 
inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(reeling from the 
ttt odor) 
ttWhew...

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttDagobah...

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThis may smell bad, kid...

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(moaning)
ttYoda...

<b>ttttHAN
</b>tt...but it will keep you warm... 
tttil I get the shelter built.
ttt(struggling to get 
ttt Luke inside the 
ttt carcass) 
ttOoh... I thought they smelled bad 
tton the outside!

The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.  Han 
removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter 
container.  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection 
against a bitter Hoth night.

<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWN
</b>
Four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.

<b>INT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT
</b>
There is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft.  He 
concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit.  He hears a low beep 
from one of his monitors.

<b>ttttZEV
</b>ttt(into transmitter) 
ttEcho Base... I've got something!  Not 
ttmuch, but it could be a life form.

<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT
</b>
The small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new 
direction.

<b>INT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT
</b>
The pilot switches over to a new transmitter.

<b>ttttZEV
</b>ttt(into transmitter)
ttThis is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue 
ttTwo.  Captain Solo, so you copy?  
ttCommander Skywalker, do you copy? 
ttThis is Rogue Two.

There is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(filtered over 
ttt Zev's receiver)
ttGood morning.  Nice of you guys 
ttto drop by.

<b>ttttZEV
</b>ttt(switching transmitters) 
ttEcho Base... this is Rogue Two.  I 
ttfound them.  Repeat, I found them.

<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAY
</b>
The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side.  
A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift.  Han spots 
Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his 
arms frantically at the tiny craft.

<b>INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER
</b>
Strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment.  A switch 
is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank 
filled with a thick, gelatinous slime.  He begins to thrash about, 
raving in delirium.

<b>INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOM
</b>
Luke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling.  His face shows 
terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack.  Threepio and Artoo enter the 
room.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttMaster Luke, sir, it's so good 
ttto see you fully functional again.

Artoo beeps his good wishes.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttArtoo expresses his relief, also.

Han and Chewie make their entrance.  The Wookiee growls a greeting.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttHow are you feeling, kid?  You 
ttdon't look so bad to me.  In 
ttfact, you look strong enough to 
ttpull the ears off a Gundark.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttThanks to you.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThat's two you owe me, junior.

Han turns as Leia enters the room.  He looks at her with a big, 
devilish grin.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWell your Worship, looks like 
ttyou managed to keep me around for
tta little while longer.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(haughtily)
ttI had nothing to do with it.  General 
ttRieekan thinks it's dangerous for 
ttany ships to leave the system until 
ttwe've activated the energy shield.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThat's a good story.  I think you 
ttjust can't bear to let a gorgeous 
ttguy like me out of your sight.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI don't know where you get your 
ttdelusions, laser brain.

Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner.  Han, enjoying himself, 
regards Chewie good-humoredly.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttLaugh it up, fuzzball.  But you 
ttdidn't see us alone in the south 
ttpassage.

Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttShe expressed her true feelings 
ttfor me.

Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttMy...!  Why, you stuck up,... half-
ttwitted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-
ttherder!

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWho's scruffy-looking? 
ttt(to Luke) 
ttI must have hit pretty close to 
ttthe mark to get her all riled up 
ttlike that, huh, kid?

Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she 
focuses on Luke.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWhy, I guess you don't know 
tteverything about women yet?

With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips.  Then she turns 
on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly 
dumbstruck.  With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head 
and grins.

Suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.

<b>ttttANNOUNCER
</b>ttt(over loudspeaker)
ttHeadquarters personnel, report to 
ttcommand center.

The voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry 
out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttTake it easy.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttExcuse us, please.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
Rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen.  He calls over to Leia 
and Han.

<b>ttttRIEEKAN
</b>ttPrincess... we have a visitor.

The group hurries over to Rieekan.

<b>ttttRIEEKAN
</b>ttWe've picked up something outside 
ttthe base in zone twelve, moving 
tteast.

<b>ttttSENIOR CONTROLLER
</b>ttIt's metal.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttThen it couldn't be one of those

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttIt could be a speeder, one of ours.

<b>ttttSENIOR CONTROLLER
</b>ttNo.  Wait - there's something very 
ttweak coming through.

Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the 
strange signal.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttSir, I am fluent in six million 
ttforms of communication.  This signal 
ttis not used by the Alliance.  It 
ttcould be an Imperial code.

<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DAY
</b>
The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three-
eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base.  It raises a large 
antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing 
signal.

The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has 
popped his head over a snow bank.  Instantly, the probe robot swings 
around, its deadly ray ready to fire.  But before it can get a shot 
off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million 
pieces.

Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the 
smoldering remains of the Imperial probe.

<b>EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET
</b>
Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five 
Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of 
space.  The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller 
spacecraft.  TIE fighters dart to and fro.

<b>INT. DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - MAIN CONTROL DECK
</b>
Controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear 
ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls.  The 
squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built 
General Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the 
approaching presence and turn toward it.  Darth Vader, Lord of the 
Sith, enters like a chill wind.  As Vader moves across the wide bridge, 
Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttAdmiral.

<b>ttttOZZEL
</b>ttYes, Captain

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttI think we've got something, sir.  
ttThe report is only a fragment from

ttbut it's the best lead we've had.

<b>ttttOZZEL
</b>ttt(irritated) 
ttWe have thousands of probe droids

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttThe visuals indicate life readings.

<b>ttttOZZEL
</b>ttIt could mean anything.  If we 
ttfollowed every lead...

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttBut, sir, the Hoth system is supposed 
ttto be devoid of human forms.

Vader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel snow base.  
Rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttYou found something?

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttYes, my lord.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttt(studying the image

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - TRANSPORT BAY
</b>
A captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the 
main transport bay.  Several Rebel transports behind them are being 
loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly, but not in 
panic.

<b>ttttREBEL CAPTAIN
</b>ttGroups seven and ten will stay 
ttbehind to fly the speeders.  As

</b>ttRight, sir.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK
</b>
Alarms sound.  Troops, ground crews, and droids rush to their alert 
stations.  Armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near 
the main entrance.

In the midst of all this activity, Han does some frantic welding on the 
lifters of the Millennium Falcon.

Han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor.  He pulls out 
his comlink, all the while eyeing problematic lifters.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(into comlink, to 
ttt Chewie)
ttOkay, that's it.  Try it... Off! 
ttTurn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!

Smoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter.  Exasperated, Han 
surveys the new damage.

</b>
Luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical 
droid stands by.

</b>
Pilots, gunners, and R2 units scurry about.  Luke, pulling on his 
heavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders.  He 
stops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon, where Han and Chewie are 
trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttChewie, take care of yourself, 
ttokay?

As Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around Luke and 
gives him a tight hug.  Han is discussing the lifter with a repair 
droid when he sees Luke.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttHi, kid.
ttt(to droid)
ttThere's got to be a reason for 
ttit.  Check it at the other end.

ttYou all right?

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttBe careful.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYou, too.

Luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on.  After a few steps, 
he stops and looks back.  Han glances up and the two exchange a silent 
communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things, 
all difficult to verbalize.

<b>INT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM.
</b>
Alarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base.  In the control room, a 
controller urgently gestures for General Rieekan to check a computer 
scan.

<b>ttttCONTROLLER
</b>ttGeneral, there's a fleet of Star 
ttDestroyers coming out of hyperspace 
ttin sector four.

<b>ttttRIEEKAN
</b>ttReroute all power to the energy

Rieekan exits hurriedly.

<b>INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER - MEDITATION CUBICLE
</b>
The dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls 
on the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube.  
General Veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving 
Vader.  Although seemingly very sure of himself, Veers is still not 
bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord.  The younger general 
stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttWhat is it, General?

<b>ttttVEERS
</b>ttMy lord, the fleet has moves out 
ttof light-speed.  Com-Scan has 
ttdetected an energy field protecting 
ttan area around the sixth planet of

ttstrong enough to deflect any 
ttbombardment.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttt(angrily)
ttThe Rebels are alerted to our

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttHe is as clumsy as he is stupid.
ttGeneral, prepare your troops for a 
ttsurface attack.

<b>ttttVEERS
</b>ttYes, my lord.

Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen 
showing the bridge of his mighty ship.  Admiral Ozzel appears on the 
viewscreen, standing slightly in front of Captain Piett.

<b>ttttOZZEL
</b>ttLord Vader, the fleet has moved 
ttout of light-speed, and we're 
ttpreparing to... Aaagh!

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttYou have failed me for the last 
tttime, Admiral.  Captain Piett.

Piett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly confused, 
touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttYes, my lord.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>Make ready to land out troops beyond 
the energy shield and deploy the 
fleet so that nothing gets off that 
system.  You are in command now, 
Admiral Piett.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttThank you, Lord Vader.

Piett's pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed 
emotion.  He glances warily at the struggling Admiral Ozzel who, with a 
final choke, stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him.

<b>INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

With a sense of urgency, Leia quickly briefs a group of pilots gathered 
in the center of the hangar.

Rebel troops carry heavy bazooka-type weapons and position them along 
the snow trench.  Men hurriedly respond to their officers' yelled 
orders and brace themselves against the rhythmic gusts of bitter-cold 
wind.

Other troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing its guns into 
position.

<b>EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - POWER GENERATORS

The giant ball-shaped ion cannon rotates into position and blasts two 
red energy beams skyward.

<b>EXT. SPACE - HOTH - REBEL TRANSPORT
</b>
The Rebel transport and its escort race away from the white planet, 
closely followed by the two red energy beams.

As the Rebel transport races toward the waiting Imperial Star 
Destroyer, it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy bolts.  The 
Imperial Star Destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful 
bolts, which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull.

The big Star Destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of control.  As the 
Imperial ship careers into deep space, the Rebel transport races away 
to safety.

Everyone cheers at the announcement, which echoes through the hangar.  
Luke turns and walks on, heading toward his snowspeeder.  His gunner, 
Dack, a fresh-faced, eager kid, is glad to see him.  They climb in.

A thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape.  Small dot-size 
objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the 
Rebel base.

<b>EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH
</b>
A Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes.  Through 
the lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker.  He 
adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the 
ominous battle machines.  Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the 
guns of the lumbering snow walkers.

The officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding 
begins to make the ground vibrate.  The pounding grows louder and is 
accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling.  The officer speaks 
into his comlink.

A speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker.  Two other 
speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction.  Other 
Rebel craft race just above the icy plain.

A giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and 
sending it crashing in a ball of flames.

<b>INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT
</b>
General Veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing 
Rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine 
forward.

Luke's speeder banks in from the side of Veers's walker and heads 
straight for its viewport, blasting away.  An explosion hits the walker 
window, but dissipates, doing no harm.  The speeder roars up and over 
the impregnable war machine.

twisting out of sight as Luke banks and starts another run.

Barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, Dack struggles to set up 
his harpoon gun.

Luke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming walker.  
Laser bolts and flak fill the air, creating a deadly obstacle course 
for the tiny craft.

<b>EXT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO
</b>
Luke's speeder moves in formation with Rogue Two, when suddenly Zev's 
speeder is hit by a laser bolt.  His ship bucks violently under the 
impact and the cockpit explodes in a ball of flame.

Spewing smoke, the speeder hurtles toward a looming walker.  Before 
they collide.  Rogue Two explodes in a million flaming pieces.

<b>INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT
</b>
Desperately, Luke works the controls of his flak-buffeted ship.  
Suddenly, the speeder is rocked by a huge explosion.  Luke struggles 
with the controls with a look of terror on his face.  The speeder fills 
with smoke, and electrical sparks jump about the cockpit.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink) 
ttHobbie, I've been hit!

<b>INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
Apart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is 
strangely quiet and empty.  Running footsteps echo through the freezing 
hallway, then Han appears.  Cracks have appeared in some of the walls 
and some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the 
underground hallways.  Han hurries into the command center.  It is a 
shambles, but some people are still at their posts.  As he enters, a 
gigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room.  He finds Leia and 
Threepio near one of the control boards.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYou all right?

Leia nods.  She is surprised to see him.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWhy are you still here?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI heard the command center had

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttYou got your clearance to leave.

</b>ttDon't worry.  I'll leave.  First

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(to controller) 
ttSend all troops in sector twelve

A blast rocks the command center, throwing Threepio backward into Han's 
arms.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttCome on... that's it.

</b>ttt(to head controller) 
ttGive the evacuation code signal.  
ttAnd get to your transports!

Leia looks exhausted.  Han grabs her and starts to lead her out.

As Han, Leia, and Threepio run out of the command center, the code 
signal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls.

Troops flee from the battle, the ground exploding around them.

<b>EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD
</b>
Three of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward the Rebel 
headquarters.

<b>EXT. HOTH - SNOW TRENCH
</b>
Continuing their retreat, the Rebels see the walkers looming ever 
nearer.

<b>EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD - ICE PLAIN
</b>
On the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over 
him.  He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing 
overhead.

Running beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at 
the walker's underside.  A thin cable follows the projectile from the 
gun.  The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.

Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his 
belt buckle.  Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling 
underneath the walker.

The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen 
snow.  Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to 
the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.  Hanging precariously, Luke 
cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.

He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the 
Imperial machine.  Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto 
the icy ground far below.  He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg 
passes by - and just misses him.

The giant walker stops in mid-step.  A muffled explosion comes from 
within - and then the walker's mechanical insides  are spewed out every 
conceivable opening.  The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like 
a locomotive on stilts.

<b>EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD
</b>
Veers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base.  The 
smoldering walker that Luke exploded stands smoking just to the right 
of Veers's path.

<b>INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT
</b>
Inside his walker, General Veers prepares to fire on the Rebel power 
generators.

<b>ttttVEERS
</b>ttDistance to power generators?

<b>ttttPILOT
</b>ttOne-seven, decimal two-eight.

Veers reaches for the electrorangefinder and lines up the main 
generator.

<b>ttttVEERS
</b>ttTarget.  Maximum fire power.

<b>EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD
</b>
The Rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed back by the 
relentless Imperial assault.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDORS
</b>
With Threepio lagging behind, Han and Leia race through the crumbling 
ice corridors.  Suddenly, there is an explosion.  Han turns, grabs the 
princess, and pulls her to the wall as a tremendous cave-in blacks 
their path.

He takes the comlink from his pocket.

<b>ttttHAN 
</b>ttt(into comlink) 
ttTransport, this is Solo.  Better 
tttake off - I can't get to you.  
ttI'll get the princess out on the

Han and Leia turn and race down the corridor.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttBut... but... but... where are

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER
</b>
Imperial troops have reached the base.  As they push through the 
blocked passageway, Darth Vader strides behind them.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR
</b>
Han and Leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar where the 
Millennium Falcon is docked.  Threepio still lags behind.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttWait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!

The door to the hangar closes in his face.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttt(exasperated) 
ttHow typical.

Quickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the golden droid 
through.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttCome on.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR
</b>
Chewie paces under the shelter of the Millennium Falcon's landing gear.  
The giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a 
few reassuring words.  As he searches worriedly for his captain, 
something at last catches his eye.

Chewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia running toward 
the ship.  The Wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl, 
then runs up the ship's ramp.  Han and Leia run up the ramp after him, 
closely followed by Threepio.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttHurry up, goldenrod, or you're 
ttgoing to be a permanent resident!

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttWait!  Wait!

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR
</b>
Imperial troops run through the base corridors.  Vader surveys the 
place.  A huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but  he calmly, 
purposefully, continues around it.

<b>INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGER - MILLENNIUM FALCON
</b>
A distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck.  Ice cakes come 
crashing down on the Millennium Falcon.

<b>INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD
</b>
Han, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping switches as 
Chewie watches a troublesome gauge.  A worried Leia observes their 
efforts.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(to Chewie)
ttHow's this?

The Wookiee barks a negative reply.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWould it helped if I got out and 
ttpushed?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttIt might.

Threepio clanks into the hold.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttCaptain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, 
ttmight I suggest that you...

Han gives the gold robot a devastating look.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttIt can wait.

<b>INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
They move to the cockpit where Han flips some more switches.  Leia 
watches him, impatient, disbelieving.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttThis bucket of bolts is never going 
ttto get us past that blockade.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThis baby's got a few surprises 
ttleft in her, sweetheart.

Han and Leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of 
stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar.

Quickly, Han straps himself into the pilot's seat and Leia into the 
navigator's chair.

<b>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR
</b>
Stormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon.  Behind them 
the giant hangar doors open slowly.

<b>EXT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON
</b>
A laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim at the 
Imperial troops.

The stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by 
the Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions.

<b>INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Chewie rushes into the cockpit.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttCome on!  Come on!  Switch over.
ttLet's hope we don't have a burnout.

A laser hits the window near Chewie as he is settling into his chair.  
Letting out a loud whelp, Chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and 
the first stage of engine fire can be heard.  Han flashes a big grin at 
Leia.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttSee?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttSomeday you're going to be wrong, 
ttand I hope I'm there to see it.

Han looks at Chewie.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttPunch it!

The roar of the Falcon's main engines blasts out everything as the ice-
cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window.

<b>INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR
</b>
More stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by Vader.  
Hearing the loud roar of the Millennium Falcon's engines, Vader looks 
toward the main hangar doors just in time to see the Falcon lift up and 
disappear outside the cave.

<b>EXT. HOTH - ICE SLOPE - DAY
</b>
Luke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon races above 
them, flying very close to the ground.

The three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their X-wing 
fighters, each going to his own ship.  Luke waves farewell, then heads 
toward his own fighter.  

Artoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as Luke 
climbs aboard the spacecraft.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttArtoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.

From his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing for 
takeoff.

<b>ttttWEDGE
</b>ttGood luck, Luke.  See you at 
ttthe rendezvous.

Luke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of 
his X-wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttDon't worry, Artoo.  We're going, 
ttwe're going.

The canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.

<b>EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING
</b>
Luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet.  
Soon it disappears into the stars.

<b>INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT
</b>
Luke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision.  He flips several 
switches.  The stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn.  
The X-wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction.

The monitor screen on Luke's control panel prints out a question from 
the concerned Artoo.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttThere's nothing wrong, Artoo.
ttI'm just setting a new course.

Artoo beeps once again.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttWe're not going to regroup with 
ttthe others.

Artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, "What?!"

Luke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttWe're going to the Dagobah system.

Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments.  He rides along 
with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence.  
Finally, Artoo chirps up.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttYes, Artoo?

Artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink, chuckling)
ttThat's all right.  I'd like to 
ttkeep it on manual control for a 
ttwhile.

The little droid lets out a defeated whimper.  Luke smiles, and 
continues on his course.

<b>EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON
</b>
The Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one 
huge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE fighters.

As it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized 
objects.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Inside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl.  Han checks as the 
ship is buffeted by exploding flak.  He appears to be doing six things 
at once.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(harried)
ttI saw them!  I saw them!

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttSaw what?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttStar Destroyers, two of them, 
ttcoming right at us.

Threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttSir, sir!  Might I suggest...

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(to Leia)
ttShut him up or shut him down!
ttt(to Chewie)
ttCheck the deflector shield!

Chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttOh, great.  Well, we can still 
ttoutmaneuver them.

<b>EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYERS
</b>
The Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star 
Destroyers.  Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight 
down, closely followed by four TIE fighters.  The underside of the Star 
Destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star 
Destroyers.  Slowly, it starts to veer to the left.

<b>INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
</b>Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen 
veering to the left.

<b>ttttIMPERIAL OFFICER
</b>ttTake evasive action!

Alarms sound all over the huge ship.  The two other Star Destroyers get 
closer, one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes 
brushing contact with it.

<b>EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS
</b>
The Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers, 
still followed by four TIE fighters.  Laser bolts spark the pitch-black 
skies.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet.  Chewie 
barks at Han.  Leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive.  
The ship is buffeted by laser blasts.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttPrepare to make the jump to light-
ttspeed.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttBut, sir!

The buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttThey're getting closer!

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(with a gleam in his 
ttt eye)
ttOh yeah?  Watch this.

Expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into 
hyperspace, but just sit there.

Han and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of 
concern.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWatch what?

Han tries again.  Still nothing.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI think we're in trouble.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttIf I may say so, sir, I noticed 
ttearlier that the hyperdrive 
ttmotivator has been damaged.  It's 
ttimpossible to go to light-speed!

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWe're in trouble!

The explosions become heavier.

<b>EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - STAR DESTROYER
</b>
The Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four 
Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Stars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon's window.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD
</b>
Han works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders 
to Chewie.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttHorizontal boosters...!
ttt(Chewie barks)
ttAlluvial dampers...!  Well that's 
ttnot it.
ttt(Chewie barks)
ttBring me the hydrospanners!

Chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI don't know how we're going to 
ttget out of this one.

Suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch 
radically.  Chewie barks.  The tools fall into the pit on top of Han.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttOww!  Chewie!

More turbulence rocks the ship.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThat was no laser blast!  Something 
tthit us.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(over comlink)
ttHan, get up here!

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttCome on, Chewie!

Han climbs out of the hold like a shot.  Both he and Chewie run out of 
the hold and toward the cockpit.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Out the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttAsteroids!

Han changes places with Leia who has been at the controls, and Chewie 
gets into his chair.  Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses 
in front of the ship.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttOh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-
ttone.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWhat are you doing?  You're not 
ttactually going into an asteroid 
ttfield?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThey'd be crazy to follow us, 
ttwouldn't they?

Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttYou don't have to do this to 
ttimpress me.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttSir, the possibility of successfully 
ttnavigating an asteroid field is 
ttapproximately three thousand, seven 
tthundred and twenty to one.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttNever tell me the odds!

<b>EXT. ASTEROID BELT - MILLENNIUM FALCON
</b>
The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its 
turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.

A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top speed.  
Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small 
explosions on its surface.  Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in 
every direction, some colliding and exploding.  The tiny Millennium 
Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain 
of rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the 
asteroids.

One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and 
explodes.  The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of 
smaller explosions.

Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly 
banks around both of them.  The three TIE fighters follow in hot 
pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out 
of control into deep space.

<b>EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYER - ASTEROID BELT
</b>
The massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the 
Falcon.  Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface.

<b>EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - ASTEROID BELT
</b>
The Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid.  
Two TIE fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Asteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft 
through the dangerous field.

Looking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid 
drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship.

Chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially 
close - to close - and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch.  
Threepio's hands cover his eyes.  He manages a short peek at the 
cockpit window.  Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action.  
Han gives her a quick look.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYou said you wanted to be around 
ttwhen I made a mistake; well, this 
ttcould be it, sweetheart.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI take it back.  We're going to 
ttget pulverized if we stay out here 
ttmuch longer.

The group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI'm not going to argue with that.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttPulverized?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI'm going in closer to one of 
ttthose big ones.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttCloser?

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttCloser?!

Chewbacca barks the same word, only louder.

<b>EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT
</b>
The Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized 
asteroids.  There is a continued display of explosions against the 
starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock.  
The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid.  
The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, 
small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.

The TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles 
directly into their path.  As the asteroid continues on its way, it 
leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep 
space.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Rattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in 
hysterics.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh, this is suicide!

Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful 
Wookiee, pointing.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThere.  That looks pretty good.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWhat looks pretty good?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYeah.  That'll do nicely.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttt(to Leia)
ttExcuse me, ma'am, but where are 
ttwe going?

Out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of 
the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.

<b>EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID CRATER
</b>
The Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI hope you know what you're doing.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYeah, me too.

<b>INT. GIANT ASTEROID CRATER
</b>
The Falcon races down into the crater.  The walls are barely visible as 
the ship speed through the tunnellike opening.  A small cave appears on 
one side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into 
it.

<b>EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING
</b>
The tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah.  Artoo, 
riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with 
some anxiety.

<b>INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT
</b>
Luke watches Artoo's words as they are translated and screened on the 
computer scope.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttYes, that's it.  Dagobah.

Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttNo, I'm not going to change my 
ttmind about this.
ttt(getting a little nervous)
ttI'm not picking up any cities or
tttechnology.  Massive life-form 
ttreadings, though.  There's something
ttalive down there...

Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttYes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe 
ttfor droids.

<b>EXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH -  LUKE'S X-WING
</b>
The X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud-
covered planet.

<b>INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT
</b>
Luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet.  
He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has 
completely obscured his vision.  An alarm buzzes in the background, 
Artoo beeps and whistles frantically.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttI know, I know!  All the scopes are 
ttdead.  I can't see a thing!  Just 
tthang on, I'm going to start the 
ttlanding cycle...

The blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's 
electronic squeals.  Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs 
were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the 
spacecraft stops.  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.

<b>EXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK
</b>
The mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog.  
Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out 
of his cubbyhole on the back.  The young warrior surveys the fog, which 
is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights.  About all he can make 
out are some giant, twisted trees nearby.  Artoo whistles anxiously.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttNo, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll 
tthave a look around.

Artoo lets out a short beep.  As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses 
his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttArtoo?

Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water 
is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttArtoo!  Where are you?

A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is 
heard.  The periscope starts to move to shore.  Relieved, Luke starts 
running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttArtoo!  You be more careful.

The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.

Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and 
turns to look for Artoo.  The periscope still steadily moves toward 
shore.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttArtoo - that way!

Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving 
toward the little droid.  The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the 
swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.  The 
droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.

Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into 
the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttArtoo!

The black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin 
to appear.  Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the 
water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of 
soft gray moss.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttOh, no!  Are you all right?  Come 
tton.  You're lucky you don't taste 
ttvery good.  Anything broken?

Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from 
his round metal body.  Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttIf you're saying coming here was 
tta bad idea, I'm beginning to agree 
ttwith you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we 
ttdoing here?  It's like... something 
ttout of a dream, or, I don't know.  
ttMaybe I'm just going crazy.

As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, 
Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.

<b>EXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER
</b>
Admiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.

After a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising 
sight before him.

Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far 
side of the chamber.  A black, insectlike droid attends him.  Among the 
various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts 
from Vader's uncovered head.  The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar 
tissue covering it.  The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet 
onto Vader's head.  When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face 
Piett.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttYes, Admiral?

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>Our ships have sighted the 
Millennium Falcon, lord.  But... 
it has entered an asteroid field 
and we cannot risk...

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttAsteroids do not concern me, 
ttAdmiral.  I want that ship and 
ttnot excuses.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttYes, lord.

<b>EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON
</b>
The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave.  It is so 
dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Han and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems.  
Threepio and Leia watch worriedly.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI'm going to shut down everything 
ttbut the emergency power systems.  

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttSir, I'm almost afraid to ask, 
ttbut... does that include shutting 
ttme down, too?

Chewie barks "yes".  But Han thinks otherwise.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttNo, I need you to talk to the 
ttFalcon, find out what's wrong with 
ttthe hyperdrive.

Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit 
to go flying.  Chewie howls.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttSir, it's quite possible this 
ttasteroid is not entirely stable.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttNot entirely stable?  I'm glad you're 
tthere to tell us these things.  Chewie, 
tttake the professor in the back and 
ttplug him into the hyperdrive.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh!  Sometimes I just don't 
ttunderstand human behavior.  After 
ttall, I'm only trying to do my job 
ttin the most...

The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he 
move back to the hold.  Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia 
across the cabin into Han's arms.  Then, abruptly, the motion stops as 
suddenly as it started.  With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they 
are in each other's arms.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttLet go.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttSshh!

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttLet go, please.

Leia flushes, averting her eyes.  She's not exactly fighting to get 
free.  But, of course, Han blows it...

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttDon't get excited.

The anger rises in Leia.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttCaptain, being held by you isn't 
ttquite enough to get me excited.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttSorry, sweetheart.  We haven't 
ttgot time for anything else.

Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the 
door.  Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.

<b>EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK
</b>
The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking 
swamp.

Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.  He ignites 
a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it.  Taking a power 
cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttReady for some power?  Okay.  
ttLet's see now.  Put that in 
ttthere.  There you go.

The droid whistles his appreciation.  Luke then opens a container of 
processed food and sits before the thermal heater.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(sighs)
ttNow all I have to do is find this 
ttYoda... if he even exists.

Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttStill... there's something familiar 
ttabout this place.  I feel like... 
ttI don't know...

<b>ttttSTRANGE VOICE
</b>ttFeel like what?

Luke jumps out of his skin.  Artoo screeches in terror.  The young 
warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the 
speaker.  Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, 
bluish creature, not more than two feet tall.  The wizened little thing 
is dressed in rags.  It motions toward Luke's sword.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(looking at the 
ttt creature)
ttLike we're being watched!

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttAway with your weapon!  I mean 
ttyou no harm.

After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really 
doesn't understand why.  Artoo watches with interest.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttI am wondering, why are you here?

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI'm looking for someone.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttLooking?  Found someone, you have, 
ttI would say, hmmm?

The little creature laughs.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(Trying to keep from 
ttt smiling)
ttRight.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttHelp you I can.  Yes, mmmm.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI don't think so.  I'm looking 
ttfor a great warrior.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttAhhh!  A great warrior.
ttt(laughs and shakes 
ttt his head)
ttWars not make one great.

With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of 
the cases of supplies.  He begins to rummage around.

Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the 
creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his 
disapproval.

Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from 
and takes a bite.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttPut that down.  Hey!  That's my 
ttdinner!

The creature spits out the bite he has taken.  He makes a face.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttHow you get so big, eating food 
ttof this kind?

He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of 
Luke's supply cases.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttListen, friend, we didn't mean to 
ttland in that puddle, and if we 
ttcould get our ship out, we would, 
ttbut we can't, so why don't you just...

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttt(teasing)
ttAww, cannot get your ship out?

The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case.  Luke loses 
patience and grabs the case away.  The creature retains his prize - a 
tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttHey, you could have broken this.
ttDon't do that.  Ohhh... you're 
ttmaking a mess.  Hey, give me that!

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttt(retreating with 
ttt the lamp)
ttMine!  Or I will help you not.

Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing 
closer to Artoo.  As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little 
arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by 
the creature.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI don't want your help.  I want 
ttmy lamp back.  I'll need it to 
ttget out of this slimy mudhole.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttMudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately 
engaged in a tug-of-war over it.

Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats."

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttAh, ah, ah!

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttOh, Artoo, let him have it!

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttMine!  Mine!

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttArtoo!

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttMine!

The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one 
finger.  Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttMine!

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(fed up)
ttNow will you move along, little 
ttfella?  We're got a lot of work 
ttto do.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttNo!  No, no!  Stay and help you, 
ttI will.
ttt(laughs)
ttFind your friend, hmm?

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI'm not looking for a friend. 
ttI'm looking for a Jedi Master.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttOohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You 
ttseek Yoda.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYou know him?

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttMmm.  Take you to him, I will.
ttt(laughs)
ttYes, yes.  But now, we must eat.
ttCome.  Good food.  Come.

With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily.  
Luke stares after him.  All he sees is the faint light from the small 
power lamp moving through the fog.  Luke makes his decision and starts 
after the creature.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttt(in the distance)
ttCome, come.

Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttStay here and watch after the 
ttcamp, Artoo.

Artoo beeps even more frantically.  But as Luke disappears from view, 
the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic 
sigh.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREA
</b>
Threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in 
front of him.  The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh, where is Artoo when I need 
tthim?

Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttSir, I don't know where your ship 
ttlearned to communicate, but it 
tthas the most peculiar dialect.  I 
ttbelieve, sir, it says that the 
ttpower coupling on the negative 
ttaxis has been polarized.  I'm 
ttafraid you'll have to replace it.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWell, of course I'll have to replace 
ttit.

He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttHere!  And Chewie...

Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and 
whines.  Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so 
only he can hear.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt... I think we'd better replace 
ttthe negative power coupling.

Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts 
to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve.  It 
doesn't budge.  Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her.  She 
rebuffs him.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttHey, Your Worship, I'm only 
tttrying to help.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(still struggling)
ttWould you please stop calling me 
ttthat?

Han hears a new tone in her voice.  He watches her pull on the lever.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttSure, Leia.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttOh, you make it so difficult 
ttsometimes.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI do, I really do.  You could be 
tta little nicer, though.
ttt(he watches her 
ttt reaction)
ttCome on, admit it.  Sometimes you 
ttthink I'm all right.

She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttOccasionally...
ttt(a little smile, 
ttt haltingly)
tt... when you aren't acting like 
tta scoundrel.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(laughs)
ttScoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like 
ttthe sound of that.

With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttStop that.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttStop what?

Leia is flushes, confused.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttStop that!  My hands are dirty.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttMy hands are dirty, too.  What 
ttare you afraid of?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(looking right 
ttt into his eyes)
ttAfraid?

Han looks at her with a piercing look.  He's never looked more 
handsome, more dashing, more confident.  He reaches out slowly and 
takes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console.  He 
draws it toward him.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYou're trembling.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI'm not trembling.

Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and 
emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him... 
very slowly.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYou like me because I'm a scoundrel.
ttThere aren't enough scoundrels in 
ttyour life.

Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an 
excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI happen to like nice men.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI'm a nice man.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttNo, you're not.  You're...

He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips.  He takes his time, as though 
he had forever, bending her body backward.  She has never been kissed 
like this before, and it almost makes her faint.  When he stops, she 
regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it 
hard to talk.

Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttSir, sir!  I've isolated the 
ttreverse power flux coupling.

Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThank you.  Thank you very much.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

The moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.

<b>EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD
</b>
The Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently 
seeking its prey.

<b>INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
</b>
Asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge 
window.  Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control 
deck.  Then slowly turns toward the bridge.  Before him are the 
hologram images of twenty battleship commanders.  One of these images, 
the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly.  
Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is 
faded and continually disrupted by static.  It is the image of Captain 
Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the 
Millennium Falcon.  Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark 
Lord.

<b>ttttNEEDA
</b>ttt(in hologram)
tt... and that, Lord Vader, was the 
ttlast time they appeared in any of 
ttour scopes.  Considering the amount 
ttof damage we've sustained, they 
ttmust have been destroyed.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttNo, Captain, they're alive.  I 
ttwant every ship available to 
ttsweep the asteroid field until 
ttthey are found.

The Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to 
Admiral Piett.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>Lord Vader.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttYes, Admiral, what is it?

The admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttThe Emperor commands you make 
ttcontact with him.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttMove the ship out of the asteroid 
ttfield so that we can send a clear 
tttransmission.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttYes, my lord.

<b>EXT. ASTEROID FIELD - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER
</b>
Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars 
away from the rest of the fleet.

<b>INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER
</b>
The Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber.  A strange sound 
enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure.  
He looks up and bows quickly.

A twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before 
Vader.  The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the 
cloak worn by Ben Kenobi.  His voice is even deeper and more 
frightening than Vader's.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttWhat is thy bidding, my master?

<b>ttttEMPEROR
</b>ttThere is a great disturbance in 
ttthe Force.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttI have felt it.

<b>ttttEMPEROR
</b>ttWe have a new enemy - Luke 
ttSkywalker.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttYes, my master.

<b>ttttEMPEROR
</b>ttHe could destroy us.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttHe's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no 
ttlonger help him.

<b>ttttEMPEROR
</b>ttThe Force is strong with him.  The

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttIf he could be turned, he would 
ttbecome a powerful ally.

<b>ttttEMPEROR
</b>ttYes.  Yes.  He would be a great 
ttasset.  Can it be done?

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttHe will join us or die, my 
ttmaster.

Vader kneels.  The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord 
of the Sith and fades away.

<b>EXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees.  A strange 
baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small 
lagoon.  The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its 
thick glass windows.  As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head, 
the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of 
the glowing portals.

<b>INT. CREATURE'S HOUSE
</b>
Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very 
plain, but cozy dwelling.  Everything is in the same small scale as the 
creature.  The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, 
whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower.  He sits 
cross-legged on the floor of the living room.

The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up 
an incredible meal.  The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and 
pans.  The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding 
that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices.  He rushes 
back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who 
watches the creature impatiently.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttLook, I'm sure it's delicious.  
ttI just don't understand why we 
ttcan't see Yoda now.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttPatience!  For the Jedi it is 
tttime to eat as well.  Eat, eat.  
ttHot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?

Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down 
near the fire and serves himself from the pot.  Tasting the unfamiliar 
concoction, he is pleasantly surprised.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttHow far away is Yoda?  Will it 
tttake us long to get there?

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttNot far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.
ttSoon you will be with him.
ttt(tasting food from 
ttt the pot)
ttRootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you 
ttbecome Jedi?  Hm?

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttMostly because of my father, I 
ttguess.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttAh, your father.  Powerful Jedi 
ttwas he, powerful Jedi, mmm.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(a little angry)
ttOh, come on.  How could you know 
ttmy father?  You don't even know 
ttwho I am.
ttt(fed up)
ttOh, I don't know what I'm doing 
tthere.  We're wasting our time.

The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.

<b>ttttCREATURE
</b>ttt(irritated)
ttI cannot teach him.  The boy has 
ttno patience.

Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces.  But there is no 
one there.  The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that 
the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking 
with Ben.

<b>ttttBEN'S VOICE
</b>ttHe will learn patience.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttHmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father.

<b>ttttBEN'S VOICE
</b>ttWas I any different when you 
tttaught me?

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttHah.  He is not ready.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I 
ttcan be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm 
ttready.

Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low 
ceiling.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttReady, are you?  What know you 
ttof ready?  For eight hundred years 
tthave I trained Jedi.  My own counsel 
ttwill I keep on who is to be trained!
ttA Jedi must have the deepest 
ttcommitment, the most serious mind.
ttt(to the invisible 
ttt Ben, indicating Luke)
ttThis one a long time have I watched.
ttAll his life has he looked away...
ttto the future, to the horizon.
ttNever his mind on where he was.
ttHmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph.  
ttAdventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh!  
ttA Jedi craves not these things.
ttt(turning to Luke)
ttYou are reckless!

Luke looks down.  He knows it is true.

<b>ttttBEN'S VOICE
</b>ttSo was I, if you'll remember.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttHe is too old.  Yes, too old to 
ttbegin the training.

Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttBut I've learned so much.

Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge 
eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned.  After a 
long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttt(sighs)
ttWill he finished what he begins?

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI won't fail you - I'm not afraid.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttt(turns slowly toward 
ttt him)
ttOh, you will be.  You will be.

<b>EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYERS - ASTEROID FIELD
</b>
The Imperial fleet around Vader's ship is surrounded by the asteroid 
storm.  Asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing 
ships.  One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid 
and explodes in a brilliant flash of light.

<b>INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the 
control panel.  Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat.

She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the 
confusion he has created within her.  Suddenly, something outside the 
cockpit window catches her eye.  The reflection of the panel lights 
obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the 
windscreen.  Leia
moves closer to see what it might be.  Large, yellow eyes flash open 
and stare back at her.  Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her 
heart pounding.  There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in 
an instant the eyes are gone.  The young princess catches her breath, 
jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit.

<b>INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA
</b>
The lights go bright for a second then out again.  Threepio and 
Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttSir, if I may venture an opinion...

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI'm not really interested in your 
ttopinion, Threepio.

Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into 
place.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(out of breath)
ttThere's something out there.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWhere?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttOutside, in the cave.

As she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull.  Chewie looks 
up and barks anxiously.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttThere it is.  Listen!  Listen!

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI'm going out there.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttAre you crazy?!

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI just got this bucket back 
tttogether.  I'm not going to let 
ttsomething tear it apart.

He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out.  Leia 
follows.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttThen I'm going with you.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttI think it might be better if I 
ttstay here and guard the ship.
ttt(hears another 
ttt mysterious noise)
ttOh, no.

<b>EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON
</b>
It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is 
attacking the ship.

Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttThis ground sure feels strange.
ttIt doesn't feel like rock at all.

Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline 
of the cave.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThere's an awful lot of moisture 
ttin here.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI don't know.  I have a bad feeling 
ttabout this.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYeah.

Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's 
cockpit.  A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of 
the Falcon.  The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it 
with a laser bolt.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(to Leia)
ttWatch out!

The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front 
of the princess.  Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYeah, that's what I thought.
ttMynock.  Chewie, check the rest 
ttof the ship, make sure there 
ttaren't any more attached.  They're 
ttchewing on the power cables.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttMynocks?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttGo on inside.  We'll clean them 
ttoff if there are any more.

Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air.  Leia 
puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the 
ship.  Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster.  Several of 
the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit 
window of the Falcon.  Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOhhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly 
ttlittle thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!

Han looks around the strange, dripping cave.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWait a minute...

He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.  
The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.

Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han.  
The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their 
faces and run up the platform.

<b>INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ENTRY AREA
</b>
As soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch.  
The ship continues to shake and heave.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttAll right, Chewie, let's get 
ttout of here!

The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes 
to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel.  Leia 
hurries after.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttThe Empire is still out there.
ttI don't think it's wise to...

Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttNo time to discuss this in
ttcommittee.

And with that he is gone.  The main engines of the Falcon begin to 
whine.  Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(angry)
ttI am not a committee!

<b>INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Han is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle.  The 
cave-quake has greatly diminished.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttYou can't make the jump to light-
ttspeed in this asteroid field...

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttSit down, sweetheart.  We're 
tttaking off!

As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks.  He notices something 
out the window ahead.  Threepio sees it too.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttLook!

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI see it, I see it.

Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen 
surrounding the entrance.  And as the Falcon moves forward, the 
entrance to the cave grows ever smaller.  Han pulls hard on the 
throttle, sending his ship surging forward.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttWe're doomed!

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttThe cave is collapsing.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThis is no cave.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWhat?

Leia's mouth drops open .  She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance 
are not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly closing around the tiny 
ship.  Chewie howls.

<b>INT. SPACE SLUG MOUTH
</b>
The Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on 
its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth 
before the huge jaws slams closed.

<b>EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - GIANT ASTEROID
</b>
The enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon 
flies out of its mouth.  The monster tilts its head, watching the 
starship fly away.

<b>EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID
</b>
The Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of 
the asteroid storm.

<b>EXT. DAGOBAH - DAY
</b>
With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick 
vines that grow in the swamp.  Panting heavily, he continues his course 
- climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in 
and out of the heavy ground fog.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttRun!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength 
ttflows from the Force.  But beware 
ttof the dark side.  Anger... fear... 
ttaggression.  The dark side of 
ttthe Force are they.
ttEasily they flow, quick to join 
ttyou in a fight.  If once you 
ttstart down the dark path, forever 
ttwill it dominate your destiny, 
ttconsume you it will, as it did 
ttObi-Wan's apprentice.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttVader.  Is the dark side stronger?

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttNo... no... no.  Quicker, easier, 
ttmore seductive.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttBut how am I to know the good side 
ttfrom the bad?

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttYou will know.  When you are calm, 
ttat peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses 
ttthe Force for knowledge and 
ttdefense, never for attack.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttBut tell me why I can't...

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttNo, no, there is no why.  Nothing 
ttmore will I teach you today.
ttClear your mind of questions.  
ttMmm.  Mmmmmmmm.

Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground.  
Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and 
pulls it on.

He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few 
feet of water.  Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on 
one side.  Luke stares at the tree, trembling.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttThere's something not right here.

Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI feel cold, death.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttThat place... is strong with the 
ttdark side of the Force.  A domain 
ttof evil it is.  In you must go.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttWhat's in there?

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttOnly what you take with you.

Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda.  He starts to strap on his 
weapon belt.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttYour weapons... you will not 
ttneed them.

Luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no."  Yoda 
shrugs.  Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters 
the tree.

<b>INT. DAGOBAH - TREE CAVE
</b>
Luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave.  
The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage.  Holding his lit 
saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and 
a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree.  Luke draws a deep 
breath, then pushes deeper into the cave.

The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it.  
His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness.  It is 
very quiet here.

Then, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness, 
illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword.  Immediately, he 
charges Luke, saber held high.  He is upon the youth in seconds, but 
Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.

Vader is decapitated.  His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders 
as his body disappears into the darkness.  The metallic banging of the 
helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the 
floor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it 
cracks vertically.  The black helmet and breath mask fall away to 
reveal... Luke's head.

Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in 
terror.

The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.

<b>EXT. DAGOBAH - CAVE - DUSK
</b>
Meanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick.

<b>EXT. SPACE - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER
</b>
Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space, guarded by its 
convoy of TIE fighters.

<b>INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - CONTROL DECK
</b>
Vader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge with a 
motley group of men and creatures.  Admiral Piett and two controllers 
stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttBounty hunters.  We don't need 
ttthat scum.

<b>ttttFIRST CONTROLLER
</b>ttYes, sir.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttThose Rebels won't escape us.

A second controller interrupts.

<b>ttttSECOND CONTROLLER
</b>ttSir, we have a priority signal 
ttfrom the Star Destroyer Avenger.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttRight.

The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune 
hunters  There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge, 
bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle-
scarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war 
droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>tt... there will be a substantial 
ttreward for the one who finds the 
ttMillennium Falcon.  You are free 
ttto use any methods necessary, but 
ttI want them alive.  No disintegrations.

<b>ttttBOBA FETT
</b>ttAs you wish.

At that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttLord Vader!  My lord, we have 
ttthem.

<b>EXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID BELT
</b>
The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a 
firing Imperial Star Destroyer.  A large asteroid about the same size 
as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship.  The tiny Falcon 
banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface.  
Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly 
on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
The ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window.  Threepio 
checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches 
tensely out the window.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh, thank goodness we're coming 
ttout of the asteroid field.

Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside.  A 
bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side 
of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side.

<b>EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID FIELD
</b>
The Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which 
creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship.  The 
Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Han corrects the angle of his ship.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttLet's get out of here.  Ready for 
ttlight-speed?  One... two... three!

Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens.  Flak 
bursts continue to rock the ship.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(frantic)
ttIt's not fair!

Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and 
captain.  Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThe transfer circuits are working.
ttIt's not my fault!

Chewie puts his head in his hands, whining.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(almost expecting 
ttt it)
ttNo light-speed?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttIt's not my fault.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttSir, we just lost the main rear 
ttdeflector shield.  One more direct 
tthit on the back quarter and we're 
ttdone for.

Han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttTurn her around.

Chewie barks in puzzlement.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI said turn her around!  I'm 
ttgoing to put all power in the 
ttfront shield.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttYou're going to attack them?!

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttSir, the odds of surviving a 
ttdirect assault on an Imperial 
ttStar Destroyer...

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttShut up!

<b>EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID FIELD
</b>
The Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn.  In the next moment it 
is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the 
massive surface of the Imperial ship.  As it moves across the surface 
of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous 
flak bursts.

<b>INT. STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - BRIDGE
</b>
The tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge.  The Imperials 
stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low 
across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge 
area.  Alarms go off everywhere.  The Destroyer's commander, Captain 
Needa, can scarcely believe his eyes.

<b>ttttNEEDA
</b>ttThey're moving to attack 
ttposition!  Shields up!

Needa and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window.  At the 
last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of sight.  All is quiet.

<b>ttttNEEDA
</b>ttTrack them.  They may come 
ttaround for another pass.

<b>ttttTRACKING OFFICER
</b>ttCaptain Needa, the ship no longer 
ttappears on our scopes.

<b>ttttNEEDA
</b>ttThey can't have disappeared.  No 
ttship that small has a cloaking 
ttdevice.

<b>ttttTRACKING OFFICER
</b>ttWell, there's no trace of them, 
ttsir.

<b>ttttCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
</b>ttCaptain, Lord Vader demands an 
ttupdate on the pursuit.

<b>ttttNEEDA
</b>ttt(drawing a breath)
ttGet a shuttle ready.  I shall 
ttassume full responsibility for 
ttlosing them, and apologize to Lord 
ttVader. Meanwhile, continue to 
ttscan the area.

<b>ttttCOMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
</b>ttYes, Captain Needa.

<b>EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DAY
</b>
Luke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain.  He stands on 
his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet.  Opposite Luke and Yoda are 
two rocks the size of bowling balls.  Luke stares at the rocks and 
concentrates.  One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to 
rest on the other.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttUse the Force.  Yes...

Yoda taps Luke's leg.  Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground.  
His body wavers, but he maintains his balance.  Artoo, standing nearby, 
is whistling and beeping frantically.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttNow... the stone.  Feel it.

Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock.  It rises a few feet, 
shaking under the strain.  But, distracted by Artoo's frantic beeping, 
Luke loses his balance and finally collapses.  Yoda jumps clear.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttConcentrate!

Annoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking 
urgently back and forth in front of him.

Artoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the 
edge of the swamp.  Catching on, Luke rushes to the water's edge.  The 
X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the 
lake's surface.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttOh, no.  We'll never get it out 
ttnow.

Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttSo certain are you.  Always with 
ttyou it cannot be done.  Hear you
ttnothing that I say?

Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttMaster, moving stones around is 
ttone thing.  This is totally 
ttdifferent.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttNo!  No different!  Only different 
ttin your mind.  You must unlearn 
ttwhat you have learned.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(focusing, quietly)
ttAll right, I'll give it a try.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttNo!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.  
ttThere is no try.

Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out.

Slowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water.  It hovers 
for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(panting heavily)
ttI can't.  It's too big.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttSize matters not.  Look at me.  
ttJudge me by my size, do you?  
ttHm?  Mmmm.

Luke shakes his head.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttAnd well you should not.  For my 
ttally in the Force.  And a powerful 
ttally it is.  Life creates it, makes 
ttit grow.  Its energy surrounds us 
ttand binds us.  Luminous beings 
ttare we...
ttt(Yoda pinches 
ttt Luke's shoulder)
tt... not this crude matter.
ttt(a sweeping gesture)
ttYou must feel the Force around you.
ttt(gesturing)
ttHere, between you... me... the 
tttree... the rock... everywhere!  
ttYes, even between this land and 
ttthat ship!

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(discouraged)
ttYou want the impossible.

Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter.  With his eyes closed and 
his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.

Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo 
beeps in terror and scoots away.

The entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore.  Yoda 
stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the 
beach.

Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore.  
He walks toward Yoda.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI don't... I don't believe it.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttThat is why you fail.

Luke shakes his head, bewildered.

</b>
<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttApology accepted, Captain Needa.

Clutching desperately at his throat, Captain Needa slumps down, then 
falls over on his back, at the feet of Darth Vader.  Two stormtroopers 
pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as Admiral Piett 
and two of his captains hurry up to the Dark Lord.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttLord Vader, our ships have

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttYes, my lord.  We'll find them.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttDon't fail me again, Admiral.

Vader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more uneasy than 
when he arrived.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttAlert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.

<b>EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET
</b>
Vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships.  the 
Avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction.  No one on 
that ship or on Vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the 
Avenger, is the pirateship, the Millennium Falcon.

Chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.

</b>ttI really don't see how that is

<b>ttttHAN

He points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel.  Leia slips out 
of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot.  Small light points 
representing several systems flash by on the computer screen.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttLando system?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttLando's not a system, he's a man.

Chewie barks over the intercom.  Han quickly changes his readouts and 
stretches to look out the cockpit window.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(into intercom)
ttHere we go, Chewie.  Stand by.
ttDetach!

Han leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile.  She 
thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and 
she gives him a quick kiss.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttYou do have your moments.  Not

<b>EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER
</b>
As the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its 
underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it.  Hidden among the 
refuse, the Falcon tumbles away.  In the next moment, the Avenger roars 
off into hyperspace.  The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races 
off into the distance.  Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's 
ship appears and moves after the Falcon.

<b>EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - CLEARING - DAY

In the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but 
his face shows less strain and more concentration than before.  Yoda 
sits on the ground below the young warrior.  On the other side of the 
clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air.  Nearby Artoo 
watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air.  
His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically, 
looking for help.

The two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then 
Luke himself tumbles over.

head sadly.

It is down on the gaseous planet.  Huge billowing clouds form a canyon

interior.  Leia looks worried.

Han turns to the worried princess and her droid.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThere's nothing to worry about.
ttWe go way back, Lando and me.

Leia doesn't look convinced.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWho's worried?

<b>EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - CLOUD CARS

The clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out 
of the cloud surface.  The cloud cars and the Falcon head for the 
gleaming white metropolis.

<b>EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - MILLENNIUM FALCON
</b>
With the cloud cars still guarding it, the Falcon lands on one of the 
Cloud City's platforms.

Han and Leia stand at the open door, armed.  Behind them, Chewie, also 
armed, surveys the scene warily.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh.  No one to meet us.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI don't like this.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWell, what would you like?

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
Lando Calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his thirties, leads a 
group of aides and some Cloud City guard rapidly toward the landing 
platform.

The group, like the other citizens of the city, is a motley collection 
of aliens, droids, and humans of all descriptions.  Lando has a grim 
expression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform.

<b>EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON
</b>
<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttSee?  My friend.
ttt(to Chewie)
ttKeep your eyes open, okay?

Chewie growls as Han walks down the ramp.  Lando and his men head 
across the bridge to meet the space pirate.

<b>EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM
</b>
Lando stops ten feet from Han.  The two men eye each other carefully.  
Lando shakes his head.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttWhy, you slimy, double-crossing, 
ttno-good swindler!  You've got a 
ttlot of guts coming here, after 
ttwhat you pulled.

Han points to himself innocently, mouthing, "Me?"

Lando moves threateningly toward Han.  Suddenly, he throws his arms 
around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttt(laughs)
ttHow you doing, you old pirate? 
ttSo good to see you!  I never thought

</b>ttt(in mock panic)
ttWhat have you done to my ship?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYour ship?  Hey, remember, you 
ttlost her to me fair and square.

Chewie growls a reserved greeting.  Lando suddenly notices the princess 
and smiles.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttHello.  What have we here?  
ttWelcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian.
ttI'm the administrator of this 
ttfacility.  And who might you be?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttLeia.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttWelcome, Leia.

Lando bows before Leia and kisses her hand.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttAll right, all right, you old

Han takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttHello, sir.  I am See-Threepio,

Before Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has turned to 
follow Han and Leia, who are walking toward the city.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttWell, really!

Lando, his aide, Lobot, and Han lead the way across the bridge, 
followed by Threepio, Chewie and Leia.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttWhat's wrong with the Falcon?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttHyperdrive.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttI'll get my people to work on it.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttGood.

Lando turns to Leia.

</b>ttYou know, that ship saved my life 
ttquite a few times.  She's the 
ttfastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR
</b>
The group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city.  They 
walk down the lovely Art Deco passageway, rounding several corners and 
passing many small plazas as they go.  Threepio lags a bit behind.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttHow's the gas mine?  Is it 
ttpaying off for you?

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttOh, not as well as I'd like.
ttWe're a small outpost and not

ttWhat's so funny?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYou.  Listen to you - you sound 
ttlike a businessman, a responsible 
ttleader.  Who'd have thought that, 
tthuh?

Lando is reflective.  He looks at Han a moment.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttYou know, seeing you sure 
ttbrings back a few things.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttt(shakes his head)
ttYeah.  I'm responsible these days.
ttIt's the price you pay for being 
ttsuccessful.

Han and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the 
corridor.

The lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid who is coming 
out of a door.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh!  Nice to see a familiar face.

<b>ttttSECOND THREEPIO
</b>ttt(mumbles)
ttE chu ta!

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttHow rude!

Threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away.  Then he hears the 
muffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit coming from within the 
room.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM
</b>
Curious, Threepio enters the room.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttThat sounds like an R2 unit in 
ttthere.  I wonder if...

Threepio walks through the doorway to the main room.  He looks in.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttHello?  How interesting.  Oh, my.

<b>ttttMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttt(from within)
ttWho are you?

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I 
ttdidn't mean to intrude.  No, no, 
ttplease don't get up.  No!

A laser bolt to Threepio's chest sends him flying in twenty directions.  
Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door 
whooshes closed behind him.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR
</b>
Lando, Han, and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of Threepio's 
dreadful accident.  Chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but 
shrugs his shoulders and follows the group.

<b>EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DUSK
</b>
In the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy case into the 
belly of the ship.  Artoo sits on top of the X-wing, settling down into 
his cubbyhole.  Yoda stands nearby on a log.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttLuke!  You must complete the

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI can't keep the vision out of my

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttBut Han and Leia will die if I

<b>ttttBEN'S VOICE
</b>ttYou don't know that.

Luke looks toward the voice in amazement.  Ben has materialized as a 
real, slightly shimmering image near Yoda.  The power of his presence 
stops Luke.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttEven Yoda cannot see their fate.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttBut I can help them!  I feel 
ttthe Force!

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut you cannot control it.  This

ttYou have my word.

</b>ttIt is you and your abilities the

</b>ttAnd that is why I have to go.

</b>ttLuke, I don't want to lose you to

</b>ttYou won't.

</b>ttStopped they must be.  On this

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttPatience.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttAnd sacrifice Han and Leia?

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttIf you honor what they fight for
tt... yes!

Luke is in great anguish.  He struggles with the dilemma, a battle 
raging in his mind.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttIf you choose to face Vader, you 
ttwill do it alone.  I cannot 
ttinterfere.

Artoo whistles a happy reply.

</b>ttLuke, don't give in to hate -

Luke nods and climbs into his ship.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>ttStrong is Vader.  Mind what you 
tthave learned.  Save you it can.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI will.  And I'll return.  I promise.

Artoo closes the cockpit.  Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of 
the engines and the wind engulf them.

ttTold you, I did.  Reckless is

Luke's tiny X-wing rockets away from the green planet of Dagobah and 
off into space.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
Within the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in 
agitation.  She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a 
lovely dress.  Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons.  She moves 
from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the 
doorway.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThe ship is almost finished.
ttTwo or Three more things and 
ttwe're in great shape.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttThe sooner the better.  Something's 
ttwrong here.  No one has seen or 
ttknows anything about Threepio.
ttHe's been gone too long to have 
ttgotten lost.

Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttRelax.  I'll talk to Lando and 
ttsee what I can find out.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI don't trust Lando.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWell, I don't trust him, either.
ttBut he is my friend.  Besides, 
ttwe'll soon be gone.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttAnd then you're as good as gone, 
ttaren't you?

Not speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM
</b>
The room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts.  Four 
Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some 
pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten 
metal.  Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt.  Chewie 
enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting 
Threepio's head.  The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, 
then reaches to grab the head.  But the Ugnaught tosses it away from 
him to another Ugnaught.  This game of keep-away goes on until 
Threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the 
ground.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
The door zaps open.  Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of 
Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWhat happened?

Chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttWhere?  Found him in a junk pile?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttOh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you 
ttthink you can repair him?

The giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts.  He looks at the 
princess and shrugs sadly.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttLando's got people who can fix 
tthim.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttNo, thanks.

There is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttI'm sorry.  Am I interrupting 
ttanything?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttNot really.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttYou look absolutely beautiful.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(coolly)
ttThank you.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttWill you join me for a little 
ttrefreshment?

Han looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the mention of 
food and licks his lips.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttEveryone's invited, of course.

Leia takes Lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to go.  Lando 
spots Threepio's remains.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttHaving trouble with you droid?

Han and Leia exchange a quick glance.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttNo.  No problem.  Why?

Han and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and 
Chewie.  The door slides closed behind them.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance 
behind.  Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, 
pure-white columns.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttSo you see, since we're a small 
ttoperation, we don't fall into 
ttthe... uh... jurisdiction of the 
ttEmpire.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttSo you're part of the mining 
ttguild then?

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttNo, not actually.  Our operation 
ttis small enough not to be noticed... 
ttwhich is advantageous for everybody 
ttsince our customers are anxious 
ttto avoid attracting attention to 
ttthemselves.

The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at 
the far end.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttAren't you afraid the Empire's 
ttgoing to find out about this 
ttlittle operation and shut you down?

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttThat's always been a danger looming 
ttlike a shadow over everything we've 
ttbuilt here.  But things have 
ttdeveloped that will insure security.
ttI've just made a deal that will 
ttkeep the Empire out of here forever.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - DINING ROOM
</b>
The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the 
dining room.  At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader.  
Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty 
hunter.

Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a 
couple of shots directly at Vader.  The Dark Lord quickly raises his 
hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they 
explode harmlessly.  Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's 
hand.  The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of 
him.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttWe would be honored if you would 
ttjoin us.

Han gives Lando a mean look.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttI had no choice.  They arrived 
right before you did.  I'm sorry.

</b>ttI'm sorry, too.

Luke's X-wing races through thick clouds toward Cloud City.

<b>INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke is grim-faced as he pilots his course toward Bespin's shining 
city.  Artoo's beeps and whistles are transmitted onto the scope.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttNo, Threepio's with them.

Artoo whistles another worried inquiry.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttJust hang on.  We're almost there.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL
</b>
Chewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell.  The stark room is flooded 
with hot light.  To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle 
screeches loudly.  Chewie is going mad.  He hits the wall with giant 
fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor.  The upper 
lights go off abruptly.  The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a 
wall, where he listens for a moment.  Then, moaning to himself, he 
moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie.  He 
picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, 
barking a few philosophical remarks.  Chewie sticks the robot's head on 
its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.

Suddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches 
two connectors together.  Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his 
voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttMmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take 
ttthis off!  I, uh, don't mean to 
ttintrude here.  I, don't, no, no, 
ttno... Please don't get up.  No!

Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry 
head.  He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio 
immediately begins speaking normally.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttStormtroopers?  Here?  We're in 
ttdanger.  I must tell the others.
ttOh, no!  I've been shot!

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - PRISON ENTRY AREA
</b>
Darth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an 
elaborate torture mechanism.  Han is strapped to a rack which tilts 
forward onto the torture device.  Vader activates the mechanism, 
creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face.

The door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a 
sharp, piercing cry of agony.  Darth Vader moves to the holding 
chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - HOLDING CHAMBER
</b>
<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttLord Vader.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttt(to Fett)
ttYou may take Captain Solo to

Han's screams filter through the torture room door.

<b>ttttBOBA FETT
</b>ttHe's no good to me dead.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttHe will not be permanently damaged.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttLord Vader, what about Leia and

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttThey must never again leave this 
ttcity.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttThat was never a condition of our

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttPerhaps you think you're being 
tttreated unfairly.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttGood.  It would be unfortunate if 
ttI had to leave a garrison here.

Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett.  Lando walks 
swiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttThis deal's getting worse all 
ttthe time.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL
</b>
Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together.  One arm is 
connected, but the legs are yet to be attached.  There is one small 
problem, however.  It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's 
head on backwards.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh, yes, that's very good.  I like 
ttthat.  Oh!  Something's not right 
ttbecause now I can't see.  Wait.  
ttWait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?  
ttI'm backwards, you stupid furball.  
ttOnly an overgrown mophead like you 
ttwould be stupid enough...

Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a 
circuit and the droid shuts down.  The Wookiee smells something and 
sits up.  The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is 
shoved into the room by two stormtroopers.  Barking his concern, the 
huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug.  Han is very pale, with dark circles 
under his eyes.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI feel terrible.

Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open 
revealing Leia.  She, too, looks a little worse for wear.  The troopers 
push her into the cell, and the door slides closed.  She moves to Han, 
who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking 
his head.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWhy are they doing this?

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttThey never even asked me any 
ttquestions.

The cell door slides open.  Lando and two of his guards enter.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttLando.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttGet out of here, Lando!

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttShut up and listen!  Vader has 
ttagreed to turn Leia and Chewie 
ttover to me.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttOver to you?

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttThey'll have to stay here, but at 
ttleast they'll be safe.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWhat about Han?

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttVader's giving him to the bounty 
tthunter.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttVader wants us all dead.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttHe doesn't want you at all.  He's 
ttafter somebody called Skywalker.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttLuke?

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttLord Vader has set a trap for him.

Leia's mind is racing.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttAnd we're the bait.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttWell, he's on his way.

Han's rage peaks.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttPerfect.  You fixed us all pretty 
ttgood, didn't you?
ttt(spits it out)
ttMy friend!

Han hauls off and punches Lando.  The two friends are instantly engaged 
in a frantic close-quarters fight.  The guards hit Han with their rifle 
butts and he flies across the room.  Chewie growls and starts for the 
guards.  They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando 
stops them.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttStop!  I've done all I can.  I'm 
ttsorry I couldn't do better, but 
ttI have my own problems.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttYeah, you're a real hero.

Lando and the guards leave.  Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia 
and Chewie help him up.

<b>ttttLEIA

ttYou certainly have a way with

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER
</b>
Four armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large 
chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks.  In the middle 
of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform.  Darth Vader 
and Lando stand near the platform.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttThis facility is crude, but it 
ttshould be adequate to freeze

Encountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER
</b>
There is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform.  Six 
Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use.  A special 
coffinlike container is put in place.  With Boba Fett in the lead, a 
squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to 
Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is 
Threepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's 
and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see 
what is happening.  His one attached arm is animate and expressive, 
intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.  The 
remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back 
so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttIf only you had attached my legs, 
ttI wouldn't be in this ridiculous 
ttposition.  Now, remember, Chewbacca, 
ttyou have a responsibility to me, 
ttso don't do anything foolish.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttt(to Lando)
ttWhat's going on... buddy?

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttYou're being put into carbon freeze.

Boba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.

<b>ttttBOBA FETT
</b>ttWhat if he doesn't survive?  He's 
ttworth a lot to me.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttThe Empire will compensate you 
ttif he dies.  Put him in!

Realizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and 
attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han.  Within seconds, other 
Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee 
with their laser weapons.

From the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in 
panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop, 
ttChewbacca, stop...!

The stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttStop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear 
ttme?  Stop!

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttYes, stop, please!  I'm not ready 
ttto die.

Han breaks away from his captors.  Vader nods to the guards to let him 
go and the pirate breaks up the fight.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttChewie!  Chewie, this won't help 
ttme.  Hey!

Han gives the Wookiee a stern look.

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttSave your strength.  There'll be 
ttanother time.  The princess - you 
tthave to take care of her.  You 
tthear me?

Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.

In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too 
distraught to protest.  Han turns to Princess Leia.  They look 
sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a 
final, passionate kiss.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI love you!

<b>ttttHAN
</b>ttI know.

Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to 
the hydraulic platform.  Han looks one final time at his friends - and 
then, suddenly, the platform drops.  Chewie howls.  Leia turns away in 
agony.

Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.

Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and 
fluid as great as any steel furnace.  Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns 
away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttWhat... what's going on?  Turn 
ttround, Chewbacca, I can't see.  
ttOh... they've encased him in 
ttcarbonite.  He should be quite 
ttwell-protected - if he survives 
ttthe freezing process, that is.

Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an 
angry glance and bark.

A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate 
out of the vat and stands him on the platform.  Some Ugnaughts rush 
over and push the block over onto the platform.  They slide the 
coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it 
inside.  They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step 
away.  Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat.  He 
shakes his head in relief.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttWell, Calrissian, did he survive?

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttYes, he's alive.  And in perfect 
tthibernation.

Vader turns to Boba Fett.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttHe's all yours bounty hunter.
ttReset the chamber for Skywalker.

<b>ttttIMPERIAL OFFICER
</b>ttSkywalker has just landed, my 
ttlord.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttGood.  See to it that he finds 
tthis way here.  Calrissian, take 
ttthe princess and the Wookiee to 
ttmy ship.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttYou said they'd be left in the 
ttcity under my supervision.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttI am altering the deal.  Pray I 
ttdon't alter it any further.

Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia, 
Chewie, and Threepio.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
As Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a 
group of people coming down a side hallway.  Artoo lets out an excited 
series of beeps and whistles.  Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops 
in his tracks with a feeble squeak.

Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the 
floating, encased body of Han Solo.  Two stormtroopers, who follow, 
immediately spot Luke and open fire on him.  The youth draws his weapon 
and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot.  The 
two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and 
fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a 
huge chunk of wall.

Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett, 
Han, and the guards are gone.  A think metal door blocks the passage.  
Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a 
second hallway by several other stormtroopers.  Leia turns just in time 
to see Luke.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttLuke!  Luke, don't - it's a 
tttrap!  It's a trap!

Before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears 
from sight.  Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing 
behind.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM
</b>
Luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings.  Leia and the 
others are nowhere to be seen.  Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the 
corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes 
slamming down, cutting off Luke's exit.  Several more doors clang shut, 
echoing through the chamber.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM
</b>
Artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door.  He 
whistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the 
other direction.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOM
</b>
Luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam.  Seeing an 
opening above him, he stops to look up.  As he does, the platform he 
stands on begins to move.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER
</b>
Luke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform.  The room is 
deathly quiet.  Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else 
seems to be in the large room.  Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.

Steam begins to build up in the chamber.  Looking up through the steam, 
Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him.  Luke holsters 
his gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader.  He feels confident, 
eager to engage his enemy.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttThe Force is with you, young 
ttSkywalker.  But you are not a 
ttJedi yet.

Luke ignites his sword in answer.  In an instant, Vader's own sword is 
lit.  Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow.  Again Luke attacks, and 
the swords of the two combatants clash in battle.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR
</b>
Leia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, 
guarded by six stormtroopers.  The group reaches an intersection where 
Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention.

The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers.  
Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia 
and one to Lando.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttWell done.  Hold them in the 
ttsecurity tower - and keep it 
ttquiet.  Move.

As Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to 
undo Chewie's binding.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWhat do you think you're doing?

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttWe're getting out of here.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttI knew all along it had to be a 
ttmistake.

Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttDo you think that after what you 
ttdid to Han we're going to trust 
ttyou?

Lando tries to free himself from Chewie.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttt(choking)
ttI had no choice...

Chewie barks ferociously.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttt(to Chewie)
ttWhat are you doing?  Trust him, 
tttrust him!

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttOh, so we understand, don't we, 
ttChewie?  He had no choice.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttI'm just trying to help...

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWe don't need any of your help.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttt(choking)
ttH-a-a-a...

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttIt sounds like Han.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttThere's still a chance to save 
ttHan... I mean, at the East 
ttPlatform...

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttChewie.

Chewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttt(to Lando)
ttI'm terribly sorry about all this. 
ttAfter all, he's only a Wookiee.

<b>EXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT'S SHIP
</b>
The two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of 
the bounty hunter's ship.  Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to 
the cargo hold.

<b>ttttBOBA FETT
</b>ttPut Captain Solo in the cargo 
tthold.

And with that, the door slams shut.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR
</b>
Lando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly 
they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttArtoo!  Artoo!  Where have you 
ttbeen?

Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be 
spun out of sight of his friend.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttTurn around, you wooly...! 
ttt(to Artoo)
ttHurry, hurry!  We're trying to 
ttsave Han from the bounty hunter!

Whistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing 
group.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttWell, at least your still in 
ttone piece!  Look what happened to 
ttme!

<b>EXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY
</b>
An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a 
large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.

Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset 
sky.  

In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh, no!  Chewie, they're behind 
ttyou!

A laser bolt explodes near the princess.  Everyone turns to see what 
Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad 
of stormtroopers running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the 
elevator.

Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break 
for the elevator.  Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess 
and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.  Lando sticks his head out 
of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely 
notice.  They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of 
captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.

But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser 
fire toward the elevator.  Once they are inside, the door slams shut 
and the stormtroopers race forward.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER
</b>
Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the 
chamber.  Their swords clash, the platform sways.  Luke aggressively 
drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttYou have learned much, young one.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYou'll find I'm full of surprises.

Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and 
sending it flying.  Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the 
youth to jump back to protect himself.  Losing his balance, Luke rolls 
down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform.  There he 
sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken.  Just in time he looks up 
to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him.  Luke rolls 
away as Vader lands.  Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his 
enemy.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttYour destiny lies with me, 
ttSkywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to 
ttbe true.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttNo!

Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly.  All 
the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.

Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and 
falls back into the opening.  There is a rumble, and in an instant 
freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision.   Vader turns aside and 
deactivates his sword.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttAll to easy.  Perhaps you are not 
ttas strong as the Emperor thought.

Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.  Liquid metal 
begins to pour into the pit.

Vader turns around - and then looks up.  He sees Luke, who has leaped 
fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the 
carbonite outlet.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttImpressive... most impressive.

Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the 
steaming carbonite pit.  He raises his hand.  His sword, which had 
fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his 
outstretched hand and is instantly ignited.  Vader immediately lights 
his sword as well.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttObi-Wan has taught you well.  You 
tthave controlled your fear... now 
ttrelease your anger.

Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger.  He begins to retreat as 
Vader goads him on.  As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he 
has been foolhardy.  A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back.  
Another exchange and Vader retreats.  Luke presses forward.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttOnly your hatred can destroy me.

Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader.  
He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to 
fill up with steam.

Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword.  Vader blocks the sword, 
but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes.  The 
energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of 
collapse.  Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of 
Vader.  He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers 
himself into the pit.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM
</b>
Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the 
reactor room.  He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward 
a large window as Vader enters.

Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.

Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall 
and comes smashing forward toward his back.  Luke turns and cuts it in 
half just as another machine comes hurtling at him.  Using the Force, 
Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an 
invisible shield.

A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke.  He deflects it.  
Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth.  
Small tools and equipment come flying at him.  Bombardment from all 
sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is 
bloodied and bruised.  Finally, one machine glances off his and goes 
flying out the large window.  A fierce wind blows into the room, 
unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.

A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.

<b>INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT
</b>
Luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his 
deactivated sword in hand.  He puts the sword on his belt and begins to 
scramble up.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM
</b>
Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the 
door to the landing platform.  They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a 
moment before the door slams shut.  The group ducks into an alcove as 
stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor.  The troopers send a 
rain of laser bolts at the group.  Chewie returns their fire as Lando 
punches desperately at the door's control panel.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttThe security codes has been changed!

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttArtoo, you can tell the computer 
ttto override the security system.

Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel.  Artoo beeps 
and scoots toward it.  Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's 
intercom.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttAttention!  This is Lando
ttCalrissian.  The Empire has takes 
ttcontrol of the city.  I advise 
tteveryone to leave before more 
ttImperial troops arrive.

Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the 
socket.  Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream.  Artoo's 
circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out 
underneath him.  Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttThis way.

Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor.  As he scoots 
along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttDon't blame me.  I'm an interpreter. 
ttI'm not supposed to know a power 
ttsocket from a computer terminal.

<b>INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR
</b>
In a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city.  
Some carry boxes, others packages.  They run, then change direction.  
Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.

Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back 
at them.  Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while 
Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?  We're 
ttnot interested in the hyperdrive 
tton the Millennium Falcon.  It's 
ttfixed!  Just open the door, you 
ttstupid lump.

Chewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor.  A triumphant beep 
from Artoo - and the door snaps open.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttt(to Artoo)
ttI never doubted you for a second.
ttWonderful!

Artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes 
outside.

<b>EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK
</b>
They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers 
reaches the main door.  Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the 
droids get on board with Chewie.  As Chewie bounds to the ship the 
Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOuch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend 
ttdown, you thoughtless... Ow!

Chewie starts up the ship.  The giant engines begin to whine as Lando 
and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttLeia!  Go!

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR
</b>
Artoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the 
Falcon.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttI thought that hairy beast would 
ttbe the end of me.  Of course, I've 
ttlooked better.

Artoo beeps understandingly.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Chewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches 
over their shoulders.  As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship 
begins to move.

<b>EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSK
</b>
The Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars 
away from the city.  Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in 
pursuit.

<b>INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT
</b>
Luke moves along the railing and up to the control room.

Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet 
Vader's.  Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke 
backward toward the gantry.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttYou are beaten.  It is useless 
ttto resist.  Don't let yourself 
ttbe destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so 
viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder.  The black armor sparks 
and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.

Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at 
him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword.  Luke makes a quick 
move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry.  
Vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins 
to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.

Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away.  At that instant, 
Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his 
hand and sending his sword flying.  In great pain, Luke squeezes his 
forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its 
extreme end.  Vader
follows.  The wind subsides.  Luke holds on.  There is nowhere else to 
go.  

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttThere is no escape.  Don't make 
ttme destroy you.  You do not yet 
ttrealize your importance.  You 
tthave only begun to discover your 
ttpower.  Join me and I will complete 
ttyour training.  With our combined 
ttstrength, we can end this destructive 
ttconflict and bring order to the 
ttgalaxy.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI'll never join you!

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttIf you only knew the power of the 
ttdark side.  Obi-Wan never told 
ttyou what happened to your father.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttHe told me enough!  It was you 
ttwho killed him.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttNo.  I am your father.

Shocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttNo.  No.  That's not true!  
ttThat's impossible!

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttSearch your feelings.  You know 
ttit to be true.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttNo!  No!  No!

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttLuke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
ttHe has foreseen this.  It is your 
ttdestiny.  Join me, and together 
ttwe can rule the galaxy as father 
ttand son.  Come with me.  It is the 
ttonly way.

Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.

A calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision.  In the next instant 
he steps off the gantry platform into space.  The Dark Lord looks over 
the platform and sees Luke falling far below.  The wind begins to blow 
at Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the 
edge.  The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, 
unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.

<b>INT. REACTOR SHAFT
</b>
Suddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft.  
When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.

<b>INT. EXHAUST PIPE
</b>
Luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.

He slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet 
hit a circular grill and knock it open.  Luke claws at the surface of 
the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.

<b>EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK
</b>
Unable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the 
undermost part of Cloud City.  Reaching out desperately, he manages to 
grab onto on electronic weather vane.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttBen... Ben, please!

Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down.  
He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments.  All the 
while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust 
pipe.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttBen.  Leia!

There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the
weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttHear me!  Leia!

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Leia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled.  Chewie is 
busy operating the ship.  Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a 
readout on the control panel.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttLuke... We've got to go back.

Chewie growls in surprise.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI know where Luke is.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttBut what about those fighter?

Chewie barks in agreement with Lando.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttChewie, just do it.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttBut what about Vader?

Chewie turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttAll right, all right, all right.

<b>EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK
</b>
The Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.

<b>EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM
</b>
Vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the 
Falcon disappears.  The wind blows at his cape.

He turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing 
platform.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttBring my shuttle.

<b>EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE
</b>
Nearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his 
body shifts in the wind.

<b>EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY
</b>
The Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city.  Three TIE 
fighter close in on the starship.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
</b>
Leia tries to remain calm.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttt(pointing out the 
ttt cockpit window)
ttLook, someone's up there.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttIt's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.
ttSlow down and we'll get under him.
ttLando, open the top hatch.

Lando rushes out of the cockpit.

<b>EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE
</b>
Luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane.  He slips 
from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks 
toward him.  The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up 
through the opening of the hatch.  Luke begins to slide and finally 
falls from the vane into space.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Out the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the 
city.  The ship gains on him.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttOkay.  Easy, Chewie.

The Falcon closes in on Luke.

<b>EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY
</b>
Three TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HATCH
</b>
The hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure.  Lando reaches out to help 
the battered warrior inside the ship.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Flak bursts all around it as the Falcon banks away from the city.  Leia 
and Chewie struggle with the controls.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttt(into intercom)
ttLando?

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttt(over intercom)
ttOkay, let's go.

<b>EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY
</b>
The Falcon races away.  It is closely followed by three TIE fighters, 
all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Explosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly.  
Chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship.

Leia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered, enter the 
cockpit supported by Lando.  Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie 
barks in joyous relief.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttOh, Leia.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttAll right, Chewie.  Let's go.

Leia helps Luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship.

<b>EXT. SPACE - CLOUD CITY - DAY
</b>
The Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races away from 
the cloud-covered city.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS
</b>
Luke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff.  
Leia gently wipes his face.  The ship lurches again.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttI'll be back.

She kisses him, then leaves the quarters.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
All over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound.  Lando anxiously watches 
the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some 
switches.  Seated next to him, Chewie points out a new blip appearing 
on the panel.  Leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the 
shape.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttStar Destroyer.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttAll right, Chewie.  Ready for 
ttlight-speed.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttIf your people fixed the 
tthyperdrive.

Another explosion rocks the ship.  Leia notices as a green light on the 
panel next to her flashes on.

<b>ttttLEIA
</b>ttAll the coordinates are set.
ttIt's now or never.

Chewie barks in agreement.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttPunch it!

The Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle.  The 
sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up.  Faces are tense, 
expectant.  But nothing happens, and the engine goes off.  Chewie lets 
out a frustrated howl.  The flak still violently rocks the ship.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttThey told me they fixed it.  I 
tttrusted them to fix it.  It's not 
ttmy fault!

Chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit.  He gives 
Lando and angry shove as he storms past him.

<b>EXT. SPACE
</b>
In the distance the TIE fighters continue their chase, still shooting 
lasers.  Vader's Star Destroyer moves behind them, determinedly 
following the Falcon.

<b>INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
</b>
Vader stands on the bridge looking out the window as Admiral Piett 
approaches him.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttThey'll be in range of our 
tttractor beam in moments, my lord.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttDid your men deactivate the 
tthyperdrive on the Millennium 
ttFalcon?

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttYes, my lord.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttGood.  Prepare the boarding party 
ttand set your weapons for stun.

<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttYes, my lord.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON
</b>
Beeping while he works, Artoo is busy connecting some wires to Threepio 
who now has one leg attached. 

Chewie enters through the doorway, grunting to himself.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttNoisy brute.  Why don't we just 
ttgo into light-speed?

Artoo beeps in response.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttWe can't?  How would you know the 
tthyperdrive is deactivated?

Artoo whistles knowingly.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttThe city's central computer told 
ttyou?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better 
ttthan to trust a strange computer.
ttOuch!  Pay attention to what 
ttyou're doing!

Chewie is in the pit.  He is trying to loosen something with an 
enormous wrench.  Frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club and hits 
the panel...

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Leia and Lando, seated in front of the control panel, are suddenly 
sprayed by a shower of sparks.

<b>INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
</b>
Vader stands on the bridge, watching as the Millennium Falcon is chased 
by the TIE fighters.  As his Destroyer draws nearer, Vader's breathing 
gets slightly faster.

<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttLuke.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS
</b>
Luke realizes that Vader's ship is very near.  He feels resigned to his 
fate.  He senses that he is beaten, more emotionally than physically.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttFather.

<b>INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
</b>
<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttSon, come with me.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS
</b>
<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(moaning)
ttBen, why didn't you tell me?

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Lando and Leia are at the controls of the Falcon.  Meanwhile, in the 
ship's hold, Chewie continues to work frantically on the hyperdrive 
mechanism.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttt(into intercom)
ttChewie!

<b>EXT. SPACE
</b>
The Falcon races through space followed very closely by the TIE 
fighters and the huge Imperial Star Destroyer.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Luke enters the cockpit and looks out the window.  He is almost 
unconscious with pain and depression.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttIt's Vader.

<b>INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
</b>
<b>ttttVADER
</b>ttLuke... it is your destiny.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttBen, why didn't you tell me?

<b>INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
</b>
<b>ttttPIETT
</b>ttAlert all commands.  Ready for 
ttthe tractor beam.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD
</b>
Artoo races to a control panel and starts working on a circuit board.  
Furious, Threepio stands on one leg, yelling.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttArtoo, come back at once!  You 
tthaven't finished with me yet!
ttYou don't know how to fix the 
tthyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do 
ttit.  I'm standing here in pieces, 
ttand you're having delusions of 
ttgrandeur!

Artoo moves a circuit on a control panel.  Suddenly, the control panel 
lights up.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Leia and Lando are thrown into their seats as the Millennium Falcon 
unexpectedly shoot into hyperspace.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD
</b>
The ship tilts up and Artoo topples into the pit on top of Chewie.

<b>ttttTHREEPIO
</b>ttOh, you did it!

<b>EXT. SPACE
</b>
The Falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge Star Destroyer 
which seems, by contrast, to stand still.

<b>INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
</b>
Admiral Piett and another captain glance at Vader in terror.  Vader 
turns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands held behind his back 
in a contemplative gesture.

<b>EXT. SPACE - REBEL CRUISER
</b>
The Millennium Falcon is attached to a huge Rebel cruiser by a docking 
tube.  Rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a Rebel 
transport ship hovers near the fleet.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
Lando sits in the pilot's seat as he talks into the comlink.  Chewie 
busily throws a variety of switches in preparation for takeoff.

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttLuke, we're ready for takeoff.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(over comlink)
ttGood luck, Lando

<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttWhen we find Jabba the Hut and 
ttthat bounty hunter, we'll contact 
ttyou.

<b>INT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER
</b>
Luke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand.  
Leia stands near him while Threepio and Artoo look out the window.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttI'll meet you at the rendezvous 
ttpoint on Tatooine.

<b>INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
</b>
<b>ttttLANDO
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttPrincess, we'll find Han.  I 
ttpromise.

<b>INT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER
</b>
<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttChewie, I'll be waiting for your 
ttsignal.

Chewie's wail comes over the comlink.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(into comlink)
ttTake care, you two.  May the 
ttForce be with you.

Luke looks down at his hand.  A metalized type of bandage has been 
wrapped around his wrist.  The medical droid makes some adjustments in 
a tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of Luke's fingers.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttOw!

Luke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it.  His hand is 
completely functional.

He gets up and walks over to Leia.  There is a new bond between them, a 
new understanding.  Leia is thinking about Han; Luke is thinking about 
his uncertain and newly complicated future.  Together they stand at the 
large window of the medical center looking out on the Rebel Star 
Cruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space.

Luke puts his arm around Leia.  The droids stand next to them, and 
Threepio moves closer to Artoo putting his arm on him.  The group 
watches as the Millennium Falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and 
zooms away into space.

<b>EXT. SPACE - REBEL STAR CRUISER
</b>
While Luke, Leia, and the droids stand, looking out the window of the 
star cruiser, two escort fighters join the large ship.  Slowly, the 
cruiser turns and moves away into space.
