<b>tFADE IN
</b>
tThe screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, a stone, 
temerald green moss. It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some 
tdistant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of 
tsunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The 
twhisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant 
trustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. 
tWe're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming. 

<b>tSUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT

</b>trunning hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He's 
ttwenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We'll learn later 
tthis man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans. 

<b>tPROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS
</b>
tflash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the man's skin. A 
tcalico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads 
tover a breechcloth. He wears leggings to protect his legs. A long-handled 
ttomahawk is stuffed in his belt.

tA green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is tattooed over 
this left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty to forty-five. His head is 
tshaved into a scalp-lock. It says: "Come and lift this from me. Take it, if you 
tcan ..." That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is 

<b>tCHINGACHGOOK.
</b>
tThe French call him "Le Gros Serpent," the Great Snake, because 
t"he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly 
tblow." 

<b>tWIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK
</b>
truns, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's running parallel 
tto Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. It's heavily canopied. There's 
tvery little brush. The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate 
tmotes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes 
tthere's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. 
tThese men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into 
travines as if they own them. They do.

trocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a 
twampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A long rifle in which is 
tcarved the name "Killdeer" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. 
tHis name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and tthe French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other 
tfrontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes 
tknow him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree 
tbranches disturbing nothing. Making no sound.

tthree men approach the fallen elk and each other. We realize they're hunting 
ttogether. Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook. His massive war club is flat and 
tangles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother. 
tThe two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection. 
tHawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness he's 
tmore the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views and candid manner 
tand in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican).

tsixty men, women and children. It's a community gathering held out of doors. 
tWe've entered mid-scene. Captain Jack is standing on a box. Some women and kids
tmill around some tables and boards laid over barrels. Cooking fires. Smoke. 
tMost but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers, 
teight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing. Off to the side are 
tan English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's in
tAlbany. A man named HENRI speaks in French. His son, MARTIN, translates.

tttplace. 

tMeanwhile ...

</b>
tis an unusually large Mohawk in a blue match coat with a little girl holding his hand. He
tsays something to Chingachgook who nods. Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an
touter grouping of the men. Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is
ttattooed. As Martin finishes, he steps forward. 

<b>tttttONGEWASGONE
</b>tttJohn Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... 
tttTwin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les 
tttFrancais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les 
tttFrancais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ... 

tThese people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot
t"mechanics" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The
tMohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been
tacculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts.
tTheir heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and
tcommercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a
thundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations
twith working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of 
tco-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA
t mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former
tindentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier
thunters and trappers ... working people.

tttNow Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. 
tttMy brothers have asked me to lead them in this

</b>tttReally? Do you want them to overrun all

tTowards the rear are two French Rangers ("Coureurs des Bois") from Le Regiment de

tbreechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're
tthe 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the
tOttawa find our people, it's all over.

tThe Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers

tA new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of the fort. On the north, the

tbirch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake.

tfollowed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and
tthe forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron
tsenses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife
tflashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto
tthe debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side. Uncas jerks

tTheir shoulders touch.

tttt(pause)
tttIn time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk 
tttto become free. In his heart he always was Huron. 
tttAnd his heart will be whole again on the day

tan iron grip. His right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires

tttt(to Sachem)
ttt Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les

ttt... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make 
ttthimself into what twisted him. A Dog, become

tcharging Chingachgook. 

<b>tVERY WIDE
</b>
tTwo men, like dots, race to collide at the center of the promontory. Now the others fall
tback... It's one-on-one. Hawkeye slows ... 

<b>tCOMBATANTS
</b>
tMagua - confident, pumped up - feints with his left, his tomahawk appearing in his
tright, sweeping backhand, while his left, magically holding his blade, is jamming up to
tgut Chingachgook. Chingachgook's dead. Except ... 

<b>tCHINGACHGOOK
</b>
tisn't there. He rolled and, on one knee with his back to Magua, his arm slams rearward.
tThe massive war club crashes into Magua's back. 

<b>tMAGUA
</b>
tstunned, turns to hatchet Chingachgook ... 

<b>tCHINGACHGOOK
</b>
tnow up and towering - slams his club right into Magua's assault ... destroying it,
t breaking Magua's right arm. And ... 

<b>tCHINGACHGOOK
</b>
t... with his momentum, spins like a shot-putter and the next blow cripples Magua's left
tside and crushes part of his chest. 

<b>tANOTHER BLOW
</b>
tdestroys Magua's collar and shoulder. 

<b>tMAGUA
</b>
tamazed. His body is broken and crippled, but he still stands. He looks into the eyes of
tthe last warrior of the Mohicans. 

<b>tttttCHINGACHGOOK
</b><b>tttUNCAS!!! 
</b>
tAnd he spins and swings. The blade side of the war club punches into Magua's chest,
tcaving him in two. 

<b>tWIDE
</b>
tMagua dies in the dust. 

<b>tHAWKEYE
</b>
twatching Chingachgook's heaving back. It's over. 

<b>tCORA
</b>
talone, kneeling in the meadow. Her eyes downcast ... 

<b>tFADE OUT ...
</b>
<b>tFADE IN 
</b>
<b>tEXTERIOR - MOUNTAIN TOP - WIDE REAR SHOT - NEXT DAY
</b>
tChingachgook's at the edge, facing the endless rolling forests to the west. A haze of
tsunlight illuminates silver and lead clouds. Hawkeye is a little apart, watching his father. 

<b>tHAWKEYE'S POV: CHINGACHGOOK
</b>
tspeaks to the sky.

<b>tttttCHINGACHGOOK
</b>tttt(Mohican)
tttGreat Spirit and the Maker of all Life ... 

<b>tON HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK
</b>
tWe HEAR Hawkeye's English translation in VOICE OVER: 

<b>tttttCHINGACHGOOK/
</b><b>tttttHAWKEYE (V.O.): 
</b>tttt(in English)
ttt... a warrior goes to you swift and straight 
tttas an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him 
tttand let him take his place at the council fire 
tttof my people. 
tttt(pause)
tttHe is Uncas, my son. 
tttt(pause)
tttBid them patience and ask death for speed; 
tttfor they are all there but one
ttt- I, Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans. 

tChingachgook's hands drop to his sides. He lets out his breath with a weariness. His
teyes seek Hawkeye's. They hold ... 

<b>tCORA
</b>
tis standing, her back to us, in front of a rock-covered grave with a wooden cross. Next
tto it is Uncas' burial platform. Cora [says a] silent prayer. Then she pauses, crosses
therself. Her emotions are spent. She moves next to Hawkeye. He takes her hand. 

<b>tHAWKEYE & CORA]
</b>
<b>tttttHAWKEYE
</b>tttWill you go back to England? 

<b>tttttCORA
</b>tttI have nothing to go back for. 

tLong pause. 

<b>tttttHAWKEYE
</b>tttThen will you stay in America? 

tShe turns to face him.

<b>tttttHAWKEYE
</b>tttAnd will you be my wife? 

tPause. 

<b>tttttCORA
</b>tttYes. 

tThey hold each other's eyes. She searches his face.

<b>tttttCORA
</b>tttWhere will we go? 

<b>tttttHAWKEYE
</b>tttWinter with the Delaware, my father's 
tttcousins. And in the spring, cross the 
tttOhio and look for land to settle with my 
tttfather in a new place called Can-tuck-ee. 

tThey move next to Chingachgook. He senses they're beside him. Hawkeye's arm is
taround her shoulders.

<b>tttttCHINGACHGOOK
</b>tttThe frontier moves with the sun and pushes 
tttthe red man of the wilderness forests in front 
tttof it. Until one day there will be nowhere left. 
tttThen our race will be no more, or be not us ... 
tttThe frontier place is for people like my white 
tttson and his woman and their children. 

<b>tttttHAWKEYE
</b>tttThat's my father's sadness talking. 

tHawkeye puts a hand on his shoulder.

<b>tttttCHINGACHGOOK
</b>tttNo. It is true ... One day ... there will be no 
tttmore frontier. Then men like you will go, too. 
tttLike the Mohicans. 
tttt(pause)
tttAnd new people will come. Work. Struggle 
tttto make their light ... One mystery remains. 

<b>tttttHAWKEYE
</b>tttWhat is that? 

tCora, listening to Chingachgook, takes Hawkeye's hand. 

<b>tttttCHINGACHGOOK
</b>tttWill there be anything left to show the world 
tttthat we ever did exist? 

<b>tREAR SHOT
</b>
tCora stands next to her man. Hawkeye puts his arm around his father. They stare out
tover the wilderness.
