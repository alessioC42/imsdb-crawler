<b>tEXT. TEXAS SCRUB -- DAY
</b>
tTwo men in shorts and Hawaiian shirts are poking around a 
tsandy section in the middle of scrub flats. SERGEANT CLIFF 
tPOTTS is in the f.g., a plant-and-tree guidebook in hand, as 
tSERGEANT "MIKEY" HOGAN works a metal detector over a large, 
tsandy bank in the b.g.  Both are Army career men with a 
tmorning off to pursue their hobbies.

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttWe got ocotillo, devil's walking 
ttstick--what's this stuff--it's that 
ttwhattayoucallit--horse-crippler.

tMikey bends to scoop something out of the sand, putting it 
tin a canvas bag slung on his hip.

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttThis place is a gold mine.

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttLead mine.

tMIKEY sees that Cliff is talking, pulls his headset off.

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttIt's a lead mine.

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttI don't know why I'm talking to you, 
ttyou've got that thing on your head.

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttYou finding lots of cactus and shit?

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttIt's not just cactus.  There's the 
ttnopals, the yuccas--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttt(Puts headset on)
ttLooks like a lot of cactus to me.

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttt(Grumbles)
ttMan knows a hundred-fifty varieties 
ttof beer, he can't tell a poinsettia  
ttfrom a prickly pear.

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttt(Troubled)
ttCliff--

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttYou live in a place, you should know 
ttsomething about it. Explore--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttCliff--

<b>tCU MIKEY
</b>
tMIKEY in the f.g. now, looking down at something as he pulls 
this headset off again--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttCliff, you gotta look at this--

tCliff wearily turns and approaches from the b.g.

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttDon't tell me--Spanish treasure, 
ttright?  Pieces of eight from the  
ttCoronado expedition--

tHe stops by Mikey and looks down, his expression changing

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttJesus--

<b>tGROUND -- CU BONES
</b>
tSticking out from the sand bank are the SKELETAL BONES of a 
tMAN'S HAND.  There is a ring on one finger.

<b>ttttMIKEY (O.S.)
</b>ttWas Coronado in the Masons?

<b>tEXT. ROAD -- DAY
</b>
tA distant cloud of DUST appears on the horizon MUSIC 
tunderscores that we are in Texas, and we SUPERIMPOSE the 
tOPENING CREDITS as the dust takes form around an APPROACHING 
tCAR.  The car comes close enough to see it has a County 
tSheriff's insignia on the side.

<b>tINT. CAR
</b>
tWe see SAM DEEDS, the Sheriff, driving. Sam is 40, quietly 
tcompetent to the point of seeming a bit moody. He sees 
tsomething up ahead.

tMUSIC, CREDITS END as Sam pulls off the road and we see the 
tsergeants standing in the scrub.

<b>tEXT. SCRUB -- DAY -- BONES
</b>
tThe hand and forearm down to the elbow of the skeleton are 
tvisible now.

<b>tWIDER
</b>
tCliff stands looking at the arm with Sam. MIKEY is a few 
tyards behind them, playing with his metal detector. Beyond 
thim we see the Sheriff's car parked.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI was driving back from Apache Wells 
ttwhen they got me on the radio.

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttThis was a rifle range way back when. 
ttBut we figured it isn't Army land 
ttanymore, it's your jurisdiction.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(Nods)
ttI've got the forensics fella coming 
ttdown from the Rangers. No way to  
ttknow how old the body is without 
ttsome lab work.

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttThat ring--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttMasons been around a long while.

tMikey has come up to them, still sweeping with the metal 
tdetector.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttTreasure hunter?

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttt(Apologetic)
ttOld bullets.  He uhm-- makes art 
ttwith them.

tSam just nods. Mikey frowns, goes down on one knee and 
tscratches something out of the dirt at their feet--

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttThe Sheriff says we shouldn't touch 
ttanything,

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttt(To Sam)
ttHe can't hear with that rig on-- 
ttMikey!

tMikey comes up with something, holds it before them. An 
tencrusted piece of metal--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttWhat've we got here?

tSam takes the thing, lays it back down where Mikey found it.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttS'posed to leave everything right 
ttwhere we found it. They're real 
ttparticular about that.

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttThe scene of the crime.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNo telling yet if there's been a 
ttcrime.

tSam frowns down at the piece of metal as he rubs the face of 
tit.

<b>tCU METAL
</b>
tSam's thumb wipes across the face of the encrusted metal. It 
tis roughly star-shaped.

<b>ttttSAM (O.S.)
</b>ttBut this country's seen a good number 
ttof disagreements over the years.

<b>tINT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY -- TEXAS MAP
</b>
tWe look at a beautiful old pull-down map of Texas.

<b>ttttPILAR (O.S.)
</b>ttWe do the best we can here--

tA teacher in her late 30s, PILAR CRUZ, steps in front of the 
tmap and we FOLLOW her across the room, carrying a poster

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>tt--but hey, public education these 
ttdays is a bit of a battleground.

tPosters hung on the walls beyond her show luminaries from 
tTexas history-- Sam Houston, Stephen Austin, Juan Seguin. A 
tnew parent, CELIE PAYNE, stands in the middle of the otherwise 
tempty classroom.

<b>ttttCELIE
</b>ttHe went to school on base when we 
ttwere in Okinawa. It's all--you know--
ttkids in the same boat--Army brats.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttHis record shows that he's a good 
ttstudent.

<b>ttttCELIE
</b>ttI'm more worried about the social 
ttthing. Are therelike--gangs, or...?

tPILAR starts to put the poster up. CELIE moves to hold it in 
tplace for her.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttWe haven't had any serious violence, 
ttif that's what you mean. We've got a 
ttpretty lively mix though--you walk 
ttinto the cafeteria and the Anglo 
ttkids are in one section, the Mexican 
ttkids in another and the Black kids 
tthave a table in the back--thanks--

<b>ttttCELIE
</b>ttSo Blacks are--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttThey're the smallest group except 
ttfor a couple Kickapoo kids. Look, 
ttyou're obviously a concerned parent. 
ttChet has no history of getting into 
tttrouble--I'm happy to have him in my 
ttclass.

tShe steps back to see if the poster, an old photo of Geronimo, 
tlooks straight. Another teacher, MOLLY sticks her head in 
tthe door--

<b>ttttMOLLY
</b>ttt(Uncomfortable)
ttPilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttOkay? He's not here?

<b>ttttMOLLY
</b>ttNo. Is he sick?

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttt(Mutters)
ttHe's going to wish he was dead.

<b>tEXT. STREET -- DAY -- CU VAQUERO PICTURE
</b>
tOn the door of a deluxe pickup truck is an airbrushed picture 
tof a Pancho Villa-looking vaquero with bandoliers crossing 
this chest and a gun blazing in each hand. We hear LOUD MUSIC--

<b>ttttAMADO (O.S.)
</b>ttLuis! Give me that Phillips-head 
ttback--

<b>tWIDER
</b>
tA small group of teenage Chicano BOYS hang around the truck 
tin the bed, on the hood, leaning against it. A BOOMBOX placed 
ton top of the cab blasts RANCHA MUSIC out at the neighborhood. 
tSomebody's legs are hanging out the open passenger-side door. 
tThe kids suddenly look as a Sheriff's Department car slides 
tinto the f.g.  A Deputy Sheriff, TRAVIS, gets out.

<b>tKIDS
</b>
tTrying to look tough and unworried as we TRACK across the 
tstreet toward them. Travis's hand reaches out from behind 
tthe camera to flick the MUSIC OFF.

<b>tINT. PICKUP
</b>
tAMADO CRUZ, Pilar's 15-year-old son, lies on the front seat 
tinstalling a compact disc player into the dash slot. He 
treaches up to the dash, can't find what he wants.

<b>ttttAMADO
</b>ttSomebody hand me the CD player-- 
ttdamelo pendejos--

tHe looks up and we TILT to see Travis leaning in the window,t
texamining the new radio

<b>ttttTRAVIS
</b>ttThey come a long way from those old 
tt8-track jobs, haven't they?

<b>ttttAMADO
</b>ttSomething wrong?

<b>ttttTRAVIS
</b>ttt(Waves radio)
ttThis is stolen property. Alla you 
ttfellas are coming down to the station.

<b>tINT. CAFE SANTA BARBARA -- AFTERNOON -- ENRIQUE
</b>
tSweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired-looking recent 
timmigrant, ENRIQUE, as he delivers platters of chile rellenos 
tto a booth. MEXICAN MUSIC plays on a jukebox in the b.g. We 
tHOLD on the booth, where HOLLIS POGUE, in his 60s entertains 
ttwo GOOD OLD BOYS--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttSo Buddy walks up to the porch and 
ttthere's old Fishbait McHenry, cleanin' 
ttthe dirt out his toenails with a 
ttpocketknife--he was the most hygienic 
ttof all the McHenrys--

tThe breakfast companions are laughing already--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>tt"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet 
ttway of his, "What you know about 
ttthem tires that went missing from 
ttmarkets?" Fishbait thinks for a 
ttminute, then he lifts up a loose 
ttboard from the porch floor and calls 
ttdown into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, 
ttthey caught us!"

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttt(Laughing)
ttBuddy Deeds. He had a way.

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttHe known who it was onnacouna the 
tttire tracks in the dirt from the 
ttback of the garage to where they 
ttloaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, 
tt"never lifted a thing in this world 
ttif there was a way he could roll 
ttit."

tMore laughter--

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttWon't be another like him. That boy 
ttof his doesn't come near it. You ask 
ttme, he's all hat and no cattle

<b>ttttSAM (O.S.)
</b>ttFellas--

tWe WIDEN to see Sam standing by their booth. No telling how 
tlong he's been listening, Fenton is embarrassed.

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttSam! I was just telling a few about 
ttyour old man.

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttHe was a unique individual.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYeah, he was that.

tWe sense a little strain when Sam has to talk about his father--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttBig day coming up--I wish we'd have 
ttthought of it while he was still 
ttliving. But he went so unexpected.

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttBetter late than never. Korean War 
tthero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- 
ttBuddy Deeds Memorial P--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI heard there was a bit of a fuss.

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttOh, you know, the usual troublemakers. 
ttDanny Padilla from the Sentinel, 
ttthat crowd.

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttEvery other damn thing in the country 
ttis called after Martin Luther King, 
ttthey can't let our side have one 
ttmeasly park?

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttKing wasn't Mexican, Fenton--

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttBad enough all the street names are 
ttin Spanish--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThey were here first.

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttThen name it after Big Chief 
ttShitinabucket! Whoever that Tonkawa 
ttfella was. He had the Mexes beat by 
ttcenturies.

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttThere was a faction pulling for that 
ttboy who was killed in the Gulf War-- 
ttRuben--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>tt--Santiago.

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttRight. But nobody here ever noticed 
tthim till they read his name on the 
ttnational news--

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttThey just wanted it to be one of 
tttheirs--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttThat's not the whole story. The 
ttMexicans that know, that remember, 
ttunderstand what Buddy was for their 
ttpeople.  Hell, it was Mercedes over 
ttthere who swung the deciding vote 
ttfor him.

tSam looks to the register where Pilar's mother, MERCEDES 
tCRUZ, whacks rolls of change apart on the counter. She seems 
tto be avoiding looking toward him.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThat so?

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttShe put it even at three to three, 
ttso as the Mayor I get to cast the 
tttiebreaker. The older generation 
ttwon't have any problem with it. They 
ttremember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, 
ttthat it was all 'cause he took their 
ttpart.

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttTell that one, Hollis--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttHell, everybody heard that story a 
ttmillion times.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI'd like to hear it. Your version of 
ttit.

tSomething about the way Sam says it puts Hollis on guard.

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttGo ahead, Hollis.

<b>tCU HOLLIS
</b>
tHollis is hooked into it now--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttThe two of us were the only deputies 
ttback then me and Buddy--it's what--
<b>tt'58--
</b>
<b>ttttFENTON (O.S.)
</b>tt'57, 1 believe--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttAnd the Sheriff at the time was Big 
ttCharley Wade. Charley was one of 
ttyour old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets 
ttkind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy 
ttbite out of whatever moved through 
ttthis county.

tHe looks down at the table--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttIt was in here one night, back  when 
ttJimmy Herrera run the place.   Started 
ttright here in this booth.

tWe PAN down to the table, The food has changed. The tortillas 
tare in a straw basket instead of plastic. The jukebox changes 
tto ANOTHER SONG and the LIGHT DIMS slightly. A hand with a 
tbig Masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla--
tunderneath it lie three ten-dollar bills.  The hand lifts 
tthem up and we TILT to see the face of SHERIFF CHARLEY WADE, 
ta big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes. It is 1957--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttt(Grins)
ttThis beaner fare doesn't agree with 
ttme, but the price sure is right.

<b>tWIDER
</b>
tWade sits across from his young deputies, YOUNG HOLLIS (30s) 
tand BUDDY DEEDS (20s). A chicken-fried steak sits untouched 
tin front of Buddy. Hollis has the anxious look of an errand 
tboy, while Buddy is self-contained and quietly forceful for 
this age.

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttWhat's that for?

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttJimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, 
ttmost of 'em relatives. People breed 
ttlike chickens.

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttSo?

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttI roust some muchacho on the street, 
ttdoesn't have his papers, all he got 
ttto say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy 
ttHerrera."

tWade folds the money and stuffs if in his pocket--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYou got to keep the wheels greased, 
ttson. Sheriff does his job right, 
tteverybody makes out. Now this is 
ttgonna be one of your pickups, Buddy. 
ttFirst of the month, just like the 
ttrent. Get the car, Hollis.

tWade and Hollis slide out of the booth to stand.

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttI'm not doing it.

tHollis stops a few feet away, shocked. Wade just stares down 
tat Buddy.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttCome again?

tBuddy looks Wade in the eye, seemingly unafraid.

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttIt's your deal. You sweated it out 
ttof him, you pick it up.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttThere's gonna be some left over for 
ttyou, Buddy. I take care of my boys.

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttThat's not the point.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYou feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him 
tttell you the size of the mordida 
ttthey took out of his hide when he 
ttrun a place on the other side. Those 
ttold boys in Ciudad Leon--

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttI'm not picking it up.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYou do whatever I say you do or else 
ttyou put it on the trail, son.

tThe CUSTOMERS are all watching now, nervous. Buddy thinks 
tfor a moment, not taking his eyes off Wade.

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttHow 'bout this--how 'bout you put 
ttthat shield on this table and  vanish 
ttbefore you end up dead or in jail?

tWade rests his hand on his pistol.  It is dead silent but 
tfor the MUSIC on the box.

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttYou ever shoot anybody was looking 
ttyou in the eye?

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttWho said anything about shootin' 
ttanybody?

tBuddy has his gun out under the table.  He slowly brings it 
tup and lays it flat on the table, not taking his hand off it 
tor his eyes off Wade.

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttWhole different story; isn't it?

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYou're fired. You're outta the 
ttdepartment.

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttThere's not a soul in this county 
ttisn't sick to death of your bullshit, 
ttCharley. You made yourself scarce, 
ttyou could make a lot of people happy.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYou little pissant--

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttNow or later, Charley. You won't 
tthave any trouble finding me.

tWade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction.  He 
tleans close to Buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYou're a dead man.

tHe turns and nearly bumps into Hollis. He gives the Deputy a 
tshove.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttGet the goddamn car. We're going to 
ttRoderick's.

<b>tCU BUDDY
</b>
tHe watches till the screen door shuts behind them, then 
tholsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing 
thad happened. He calls softly--

<b>ttttBUDDY
</b>ttMuchacho--mas cerveza por favor.

tHe looks up at somebody and we PAN till we see Sam, still 
tstanding over the booth, listening. We are back in 1995--

<b>ttttHOLLIS (O.S.)
</b>tt"Mas cerveza por favor."

<b>ttttFENTON (O.S.)
</b>ttThat Buddy was a cool breeze.

tWe PULL BACK to see Hollis and his buddies at the table, 
teating their lunches as they listen.

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttCharley Wade were known to have put 
tta good number of people in the ground, 
ttand your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball 
ttwith him.

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttWe made our collection at Roderick's 
ttplace and that was the last anybody 
ttseen hide nor hair of him.  He went 
ttmissing the next day, along with ten 
ttthousand dollars in county funds 
ttfrom the safe at the jail.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNever heard from him again?

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttNot a peep. Buddy run the man out of 
tttown.

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttBuddy Deeds said a thing, he damn 
ttwell backed it up. Won't be another 
ttlike him.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttSo he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera's 
ttpeople and sent 'em back to the other 
ttside?

tHollis sees what Sam is getting at, grins--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttOh--he come to an accommodation. 
ttMoney doesn't always need to change 
tthands to keep the wheels turning.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttLook, I know you had some problems 
ttwith your father, and he and Muriel-- 
ttwell--

<b>ttttFENTON
</b>ttYour mother was a saint.

<b>ttttHOLLIS

tblasts from inside.

<b>tEXT. DOORWAY -- CHET
</b>
tCHET, a Black kid around 15, stands nervously at the door 
tbuilding up his courage.  He takes a deep breath, plunges 
tin.

<b>tINT. BIG O'S
</b>
tWe TRACK with Chet, very nervous, as he makes his way through 
tthe crowded roadhouse. The customers are all Black, many 
tfrom the nearby Army post, SHOUTING and LAUGHING over the

<b>tCHET'S POV -- OTIS
</b>
tSeen through the crush is OTIS "BIG O" PAYNE, a large man in

tHe nervously puts his hand under his jacket. A gun? He pushes

tMoving in on him. Otis looks over, sees the boy, frowns--

<b>tCHET
</b>
tReaching under his jacket, he pulls out--a photograph. He 
tlooks at it--suddenly there is a SCREAM from behind, then

tChet whirls around and we WHIP PAN to see a young man, SHADOW, 
temptying his pistol into RICHIE, a young soldier, as a young 
twoman, ATHENA, screams and tries to pull the gun away. With 
tthe last shot, Shadow turns and heads for the door, but is

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttMrs. Bledsoe?

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttThat's me.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI'm Sheriff Deeds--

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttSheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just 
ttSheriff junior.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(Smiles)
ttYeah, that's the story of my life.

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttYou ever play one of these?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI've seen 'em.

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttWell, don't ever start up on 'em, 
ttcause once you do you can't stop. I 
tttell myself I'm gonna play just three 
ttlittle games after breakfast, and 
tthere I sit with half the day gone.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou mind if I ask a few questions 
ttabout your husband? Roderick?

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttI won't say nothing bad about the 
ttman, but you can ask away.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHe had the club out on the old trail 
ttroad--

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttWe run that twenty-odd years. Give 
ttit over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttSo you must remember Sheriff Wade.

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttNot if I can help it.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou had to deal with him in running 
ttthe club.

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttThem days, you deal with Sheriff 
ttWade or you didn't deal at all. First 
ttof the month, every month, he remind 
ttyou of who you really workin' for.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHe squeezed money out of you?

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttWasn't legal to sell liquor in a 
ttglass back then unless you was a 
ttclub, see. Roderick used to say, 
tt"Buy yourself a drink, you get a 
ttfree membership." But Sheriff Wade, 
tthe could shut you down anytime.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttAnd my father?

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttSheriff Buddy was a different story. 
ttLong as Roderick throw his weight 
ttthe right way on election day, make 
ttsure all the colored get out to vote-
ttwe was called colored back then, if 
ttyou was polite--maybe throw a barbecue 
ttfor the right people now and then, 
ttthings was peaceful. That Sheriff 
ttWade, though, he took an awful big 
ttbite.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttPeople didn't complain?

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttNot if they was colored or Meskin. 
ttNot if they wanted to keep breathin'.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttDo you remember the last time you 
ttsaw him?

tMinnie thinks, puts down the Gameboy--

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttI seen him in our place the last 
ttweek before he gone missin'.

tWe TRACK in to a close-up of her. R&B MUSIC FADES UP slowly--

<b>ttttMINNIE
</b>ttHe used to come in whilst we was in 
ttfull swing, make people nervous. Had 
tthim a smile like the Grim Reaper--

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ROADHOUSE --
</b>
tThe joint is crowded, people drinking, talking, laughing, a 
tfew dancing, all trying to avoid locking eyes with Sheriff 
tWade, who sits with his legs stretched out at a table.

tYoung Hollis sits by him, smiling uncomfortably. Sax-wailing 
tR&B blasts from the jukebox. YOUNG OTIS, a slick, confident 
tcharacter with straightened hair and a silk shirt on, in his 
tearly 20s, stops to talk with a MAN on his way to bring a 
ttray with a couple beers and glasses over.

<b>ttttMINNIE (V.O.)
</b>tt--just sit back with his hand on 
ttthat big ol' gun and act the kingfish 
ttwith everybody. Otis Payne had come 
ttto work for us by then, and that boy 
tthad him some attitude--

<b>tCU WADE
</b>
tWatching Young Otis with narrowed eyes--

<b>tCU WADE'S POV -- OTIS
</b>
tA man puts a slip of paper in Otis's pocket, pats his back. 
tOtis winks to acknowledge the bet, turns, makes eyes at a 
tPRETTY WOMAN sitting at the bar, who is eyeing him back.  He 
tlays the beers and glasses on the table, starts away.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttPour it.

<b>tOTIS TURNS, CUPS HIS HAND AROUND HIS EAR-
</b>
<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttPour it.

tExpressionless, he starts to pour the beer into Wade's glass. 
tThe Sheriff looks up into his face--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttI know you?

<b>ttttYOUNG OTIS
</b>ttName's Otis.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttOtis what?

<b>ttttYOUNG OTIS
</b>ttPayne.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttOne of Cleroe Payne's boys?

<b>ttttYOUNG OTIS
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttI sent your Daddy to the farm once.

<b>ttttYOUNG OTIS
</b>ttI know that.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttWhy you think that was?

tOtis feels people watching.  He doesn't want to lose face--

<b>ttttYOUNG OTIS
</b>ttSome crop needed pickin' and the man 
ttwas shorthanded.

tA very insolent answer for the time and place--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttAs I remember it was because he had 
tta sassy mouth on him. Must run in 
ttthe family--You wouldn't be runnin' 
ttnumbers out of this club, now, would 
ttyou, son?

<b>ttttYOUNG OTIS
</b>ttRunnin' numbers illegal.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttRunnin' numbers without I know about 
ttit is both illegal and unhealthy. 
ttYou remember that.

tThe beer is poured. Otis starts away--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttWhoah, son. You're not finished. 
ttPour his.

<b>ttttYOUNG HOLLIS
</b>ttI prefer it in the bottle--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttShut up, Hollis. Pour.

tOtis meets Wade's look now, pours the other beer--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttHow come you don't took familiar?

<b>ttttYOUNG OTIS
</b>ttBeen away. Up to Houston.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttHouston, huh? I hear they let you 
ttboys run wild up there.

tNo response. Wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer 
tsplashes on the table and drips into Hollis's lap--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttAw--look what you done now. Better 
ttget something to wipe it up, son.

tHalf the people in the room are watching now, the other half 
tmoving away to relative safety. Otis tries to keep a lid on 
this temper, looks around the room--

<b>ttttYOUNG OTIS
</b>ttYou spilt it, you wipe it up.

tWade stands, steely-eyed, and looks at Otis nose to nose--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttI told you to do something. Are you 
ttgonna hop to it, or are we gonna 
tthave a problem?

tOtis is starting to shake, but holds his ground--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttDon't want to turn tail in front of 
ttyour people. I understand.

tHe starts to turn away then WHAP! brings the butt of his 
tpistol up under Otis's chin, knocking him to the floor. A 
twoman SCREAMS and Otis, enraged, grabs the chair he has fallen 
tover, starts to get up--but Wade has the pistol levelled at 
this face--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttCome on, Houston, give it a try! 
ttCome to Poppa--

tRODERICK is out on the floor now, hands held out in a gesture 
tof peace, as YOUNG MINNIE watches from behind the bar, 
tpetrified--

<b>ttttRODERICK
</b>ttDon't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just 
tta bit slow, is all. He don't mean 
ttnothin' by it--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttThat the problem, son?  You Slow?

<b>ttttRODERICK
</b>ttOtis, apologize to the Sheriff--

tOtis eases the chair down but doesn't say anything--

<b>ttttRODERICK
</b>ttYou got him too scared to peep, 
ttSheriff. Maybe if you put that gun 
ttup--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYou telling me what to do, Roderick?

<b>ttttRODERICK
</b>ttNo, Sheriff, I'm just--

tWade looks around, widens his eyes in mock surprise--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttWhat's this I see? Is that whiskey 
ttin them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, 
ttI'm gonna have to cite you for a 
ttviolation of state law--

<b>ttttRODERICK
</b>ttThis is a club, Sheriff--you been in 
tthere--

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttAnd people better clear out of here! 
ttNow!

tA few people start for the exit.  Wade swivels and BLAM sends 
ta bullet past Minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind 
tthe bar.  People run for the door. Wade squats down to look 
tOtis in the face--

<b>tCU WADE
</b>
<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYou learn how to act your place, 
ttson. This idn't Houston.

tHe stands and we FOLLOW him toward the bar--

<b>ttttOTIS (V.O.)
</b>tt'Course I was young and full of beans 
ttthen--

tThe camera passes Wade and instead of Minnie there stands 
tOtis, PRESENT DAY, reminiscing. We are back in '95--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttI didn't understand the spot I was 
ttputting Roderick in.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttAnd that was the last time you saw 
tthim?

tWe SHIFT to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttOh--I think he came in one more time 
ttwith Hollis and--naw, your Daddy 
ttwasn't with them. Made their monthly 
ttpickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just 
ttkept my mouth good and shut and handed 
ttover that envelope.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThat was the night he disappeared?

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttt(Shakes his head)
ttCould of been. That was white people's 
ttbusiness.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttAnd when my father was Sheriff?

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttWhat about it?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhat was your deal with him?

tOtis smiles, chooses his words carefully--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttBuddy was more a part of the big 
ttpicture--county political machine,  
ttchamber of commerce, zoning board if 
ttI kept those people happy, he was 
ttpretty much on my side.
ttt(Smiles)
ttWhenever somebody thought--they start 
ttup another bar for the black  folks, 
ttthey'd be--how should I put this? 
ttThey'd be officially discouraged.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHe ever accept cash for a favor?

tOtis smiles, looks away to ponder his response--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttI don't recall a prisoner ever died 
ttin your father's custody. I don't 
ttrecall a man in this town--Black, 
ttWhite, Mexican--who'd hesitate a 
ttminute before they'd call on Buddy 
ttDeeds to solve a problem. More than 
ttthat I wouldn't like to say.

</b>ttPleased to meet you.

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttSheriff Deeds was in on our 
ttarcheological find yesterday.

<b>ttttPRISCILLA
</b>ttIt true they gonna build a shopping 
ttmall out there?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttIf certain people have their way, 
ttit's going to be a new jail.

<b>ttttPRISCILLA
</b>ttDamn. Maybe we got in the wrong 
ttbusiness. They closin' down military 
ttbases left and right, puttin' up 
ttjails like 7-11 stores.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttDo either of you have any idea when 
ttthey stopped using that site as a 
ttrifle range?

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttThey stopped training infantry there 
ttin the late '50s. It was just a 
ttplayground for the jackrabbits till 
ttthey gave it to the county last year.

<b>ttttPRISCILLA
</b>ttYou know who it was they dug up?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNot for sure yet. But I kind of wish 
ttthey hadn't.

<b>tEXT. CAFE -- NIGHT
</b>
tEnrique steps out of the darkened cafe, followed by Mercedes, 
twho locks up. Mercedes steps over to an expensive-looking 
tcar--

<b>ttttENRIQUE
</b>ttEs muy lindo, su coche--

<b>ttttMERCEDES
</b>ttEn ingles Enrique. This is the United 
ttStates. We speak English.

<b>ttttENRIQUE
</b>ttIs very beautiful, your car.

<b>ttttMERCEDES
</b>ttGood night, Enrique. She slides into 
ttthe car--

<b>ttttENRIQUE
</b>ttBuenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique 
ttwalks in the opposite direction--

<b>tttttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b>tEXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- DAY -- CU DEL
</b>
tDel, in uniform, approaches the front door of Big O's, not 
topen for business yet. We TIGHTEN as he stops to read a 
thandlettered sign next to it: "BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT REAR 
tENTRANCE." He steps in--

<b>tINT. ROADHOUSE
</b>
tLate-50s R&B plays on the JUKEBOX. Otis stands behind the 
tcounter hooking the beer taps up. Del steps in and sits on a 
tstool at the far end of the bar, tense, looking around the 
tplace. When Otis sees him, he stops dead. They lock eyes for 
ta moment, then Otis turns to call.

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttCarolyn--knock that off for a minute.

<b>tCAROLYN
</b>
tCAROLYN SYKES, an attractive woman maybe ten years younger 
tthan Otis, pulls the plug from the jukebox near where she's 
tscrubbing bloodstains off the floor. She turns to look at 
tthe newcomer--

<b>tBAR
</b>
tDel doesn't move to come closer--

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttBlack Seminoles?

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttt(Shrugs)
ttHobby of mine. Got some artifacts, 
ttcouple pieces one of your men out at 
ttthe base made. Free admission.

tDel nods toward where Carolyn is mopping--

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttThat where he was shot?

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttThat's where he fell.

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttYou get much of that in here?

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttIt's a bar. People come together, 
ttdrink, fall in love, fall out of 
ttlove, air their grudges out--

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttDeal drugs in the bathroom--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttIf I thought it would help I'd put 
ttup a sign telling them not to. Right 
ttunder the one about the employees 
ttwashing their hands.

tCarolyn has come over by Otis, lugging the bucket and mop--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttThis here's Carolyn. Honey, this is 
ttmy son, Delmore.

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttNice to meet you, Ma'am.

tCarolyn nods, shoots a look to Otis--

<b>ttttCAROLYN
</b>ttI'll be in back waiting for that 
ttdelivery.

tThey wail till she is gone to start again--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttSo.

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttSo tell me why I shouldn't make this 
ttplace off-limits.

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttThis is an official visit, then--

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttI assume a lot of your business is 
ttfrom our people.

tOtis pulls a tap back and it coughs before squirting beer.

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttYour boys out there cooped up 
tttogether, need somewhere they can 
ttlet the steam out. If they're Black, 
ttthere's not but one place in this 
tttown they feel welcome. Been that 
ttway since before you were born.

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttWe have an enlisted man's club at 
ttthe post.

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttWell, you're the Man out there now, 
ttaren't you? It's your call.

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttThat's right.

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttt(Smiles)
ttI been hearing rumors about this new 
ttcommander coming for a couple weeks 
ttnow. Boys say they heard he's a real 
tthard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full-
ttbird colonel name of Payne, they say-- 
ttBet you never figured you end up 
ttback here.

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttThe Army hands you a command, you go 
ttwherever it is.

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttI hear things, too.  People call  
ttyou the Mayor of Darktown.

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttt(Shrugs)
ttOver the years, this is the one place 
ttthat's always been there. I loan a 
ttlittle money out, settle some 
ttarguments. Got a cot in the back- 
ttpeople get afraid to go home they 
ttcan spend the night. There's not 
ttenough of us to run anything in this 
tttown- the white people are mostly 
ttout on the lake now and the Mexicans 
tthire each other. There's the Holiness 
ttChurch and there's Big O's place.

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttAnd people make their choice--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttt(Smiles)
ttA lot of 'em choose both. There's 
ttnot like a borderline between the 
ttgood people and the bad people--you're 
ttnot either on one side or the other--

tDel looks away, not wanting to believe this--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttt(Softly)
ttI gonna meet that family of yours?

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttWhy would you want to do that?

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttBecause I'm your father.

tDel gives him a dark look and lets the statement hang between 
tthem. He gets up and heads for the door--

<b>ttttDEL
</b>ttYou'll get official notification 
ttwhen I make my decision. He is out 
ttthe door--Otis pulls himself a beer 
ttas Carolyn steps back out--

<b>ttttCAROLYN
</b>ttSo that's him--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttYeah--that's him. Got two, three 
ttthousand people under him out there, 
ttyou count the civilians.

<b>ttttCAROLYN
</b>ttThat must be a laugh a minute.

<b>tEXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY
</b>
tSam walks down the main street of town. A CROWD is gathering 
tat the other end for the ceremony--

<b>ttttH.L. (O.S.)
</b>ttSheriff!

tWe WIDEN as H.L. and Jorge catch up to him. H.L. slaps Sam 
ton the back--

<b>ttttH.L.
</b>ttHistoric occasion, isn't it?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttSeems like we have another one every 
ttweek.

<b>ttttH.L.
</b>ttJorge and his Chamber of Commerce 
ttboys got to keep things hummin'--

<b>ttttJORGE
</b>ttWe're building up tourism, Sam--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttPeople come here to catch bass and 
ttto get laid at the Boy's Town in 
ttCuidad Leon--

<b>ttttJORGE
</b>ttSam--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou ought to put up a banner--
tt"Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut-
ttRate Pussy"--

<b>ttttH.L.
</b>ttThat kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttRather have that than the ten-foot-
tthigh catfish statue--

<b>ttttJORGE
</b>ttI got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel 
ttto kill that story.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThe Perdido thing?

<b>ttttJORGE
</b>ttHe agreed it wasn't exactly news--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttDanny's gonna be out for blood the 
ttnext time.

<b>ttttH.L.
</b>ttWhich is why we need to talk to you 
ttabout the new jail--just so we're 
ttall on the same page.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWe don't need a new jail.

<b>ttttH.L.
</b>ttThat's a matter of interpretation--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWe're already renting cells to the 
ttFeds for their overflow--

<b>ttttJORGE
</b>ttThere was a mandate in the last 
ttelection--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttIt wouldn't happen to be your 
ttconstruction company gonna get the 
ttbid on building this thing, would 
ttit, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be 
ttthinking about a couple dozen new 
ttjobs to dangle in front of the voters--

<b>ttttH.L.
</b>ttDammit, Sam, the people are concerned 
ttabout crime--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWe need a drug rehab program, we 
ttneed a new elementary school--

<b>ttttJORGE
</b>ttThere isn't money allocated for that. 
ttBut a jail--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttLook, I'm not gonna campaign against 
ttyour deal here, but if anybody asks 
ttme, I got to tell them the truth. We--
ttdon't--need--a new jail.

<b>ttttH.L.
</b>ttWhen we backed you--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhen you backed me you needed  
ttsomebody named Deeds to bump the  
ttother fella out of office.  Hey,  
ttfolks--

tSam and the others smile as they reach the CROWD of 
ttownspeople, mostly small business owners and retired people. 
tPhotographers from the paper and a local TV news crew wait 
tby a veiled Statue roped off in a little traffic island. 
tMercedes, dressed to kill, stands waiting next to Hollis 
twith a huge pair of scissors in her hand.

<b>tCU MERCEDES
</b>
tSlowly working the blades of the scissors, she looks coldly 
tat Sam--

<b>tCU SAM
</b>
tHe nods to her as the crowd opens a path for him.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttLet's get this thing over with.

<b>tINT. MIKEY'S WORKSHOP -- MORNING
</b>
tWe start on a two-foot-high statue of a cowboy made from old 
tbullets and shell casings. We PAN past a few others, the 
tposes lifted from Frederic Remington paintings, till we see 
tMikey, gluing together a work in progress, a Remington book 
tpropped open in front of him. Cliff sits at the worktable 
tplaying absently with the old bullets spilled out from MIKEY'S 
tbag

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttNever thought I'd see the day a buddy 
ttof mine was dating a woman with three 
ttup and three down on her shoulder.

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttI think it's beyond what you'd call 
ttdating.

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttYou going to get married?

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttt(Shrugs)
ttMaybe.

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttYou met her family? They gonna be 
ttcool about you being a white guy?

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttPriscilla says they think any woman 
ttover 30 who isn't married must be a 
ttlesbian. She figures they'll be so 
ttrelieved I'm a man--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttAlways heartwarming to see a prejudice 
ttdefeated by a deeper prejudice.  But 
ttmarriage, man--I did two tours in 
ttSoutheast Asia and I was married for 
ttfive years--I couldn't tell you which 
ttexperience was worse.

tCliff picks up a slug--

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttHey, Mikey--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttI knew she was Japanese going into 
ttit, but she didn't tell me the ninja 
ttassassin part--

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttMikey--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttHer parents acted like I was gonna 
ttblow my nose on their curtains--

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttMikey--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttIf I stayed out past ten with the 
ttguys she'd go into her Madame 
ttButterfly routine--

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttMikey look at this--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttWhat--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with 
ttbullets here.

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttIt's a .45.

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttThis is the stuff we picked up the 
ttother day, right? The rest of this 
ttis all .30 caliber--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttThey were using M-1's, yeah--

<b>ttttCLIFF
</b>ttWhat's it doing on a rifle range?

tMIKEY holds the slug in front of his face--

<b>ttttMIKEY
</b>ttWe better call that Sheriff.

<b>tEXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY
</b>
tHollis is finishing his oration, having put the crowd in a 
tgood mood.

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttSometime in the early '70s a reporter 
ttfrom a national magazine was talking 
ttto the governor of our Lone Star 
ttstate, and he asked him, "Governor, 
ttwhat's your ideal of what a real 
ttTexan ought to be?" Governor said, 
tt"That's easy, son- you just go down 
ttto Rio County and get a look at 
ttSheriff Buddy Deeds."

tApplause--

<b>tSAM
</b>
tWatching the crowd--

<b>tSAM'S POV
</b>
tWe PAN with his gaze across smiling faces, till he comes to 
tDanny and a couple of Chicano friends, looking grim. We RACK 
tFOCUS beyond them to see Pilar, watching the ceremony from a 
tfew yards back--

<b>ttttHOLLIS (O.S.)
</b>ttThank you. We've got one more person 
ttto hear from--

<b>tHOLLIS
</b>
<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>tt--and he's somebody who probably 
ttknew Buddy better than any of us, 
ttSam--would you say a few words?

<b>tSAM
</b>
tNot thrilled to be called on. He steps forward reluctantly 
tto APPLAUSE--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou folks who remember my father 
ttknew him as Sheriff. But at home he 
ttwas also judge, jury

tHe looks to Hollis--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>tt--and executioner.

tLAUGHTER. Sam holds Hollis's eyes for a moment before 
tcontinuing--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThis is a real honor you're doing 
tthim today, and if Buddy was around 
ttI'm sure his hat size would be gettin' 
ttbigger every minute.

<b>tPILAR
</b>
tWatching--

<b>ttttSAM (O.S.)
</b>ttI used to come to this park to hide 
ttfrom him. Now that you're putting 
tthis name on it--

<b>tSAM
</b>
<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI'll have to find someplace new to 
ttduck out.

tMore LAUGHTER--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI do appreciate it, and wherever he 
ttis, Buddy's puttin' the beer on ice 
ttfor the bunch of you. Thank you.

<b>tAPPLAUSE--
</b>
tSam steps back and Mercedes steps forward with her scissors 
twithout looking at him--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttAnd now my fellow Council member and 
ttone of Frontera's most respected 
ttbusinesswomen, Mrs. Mercedes Cruz, 
ttwill do the honors for us.

<b>tMERCEDES
</b>
tShe freezes, smiling, till the still photographers have gotten 
ttheir shots, then snips the cord to a pulley system that 
tlets the cloth drop--

<b>tSTATUE
</b>
tThe cloth drops to reveal a bas-relief in brass set in a 
tblock of smooth limestone.  A decent likeness of Buddy in 
tuniform, his hand on the shoulder of a small Chicano-looking 
tboy who stands beside him, eyes raised worshipfully.

tAPPLAUSE from the gathering--

<b>tSAM
</b>
tWatching, a bit removed, as Mercedes shakes hands with Jorge 
tand H.L. and Hollis for the cameras. He overhears a pair of 
tBYSTANDERS who are checking out the statue--

<b>ttttBYSTANDER 1 (O.S.)
</b>ttIt does look like old Buddy.

<b>ttttBYSTANDER 2 (O.S.)
</b>ttRunnin that kid in for loiterin'--

tThe bystanders LAUGH--Sam steps away, intercepting Mercedes 
tas she steps away--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.

tMercedes just looks at him, keeps going. His gaze brings him 
tto Pilar, standing on the sidewalk, watching.

</b>
tSteps over from the dispersing crowd--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttField trip?

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttLunch hour. My next class isn't till

</b>ttWant to take a walk?

<b>tEXT. RIVERSIDE -- DAY
</b>
tSam and PILAR walk together alongside the Rio--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYour mother still doesn't like me.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttI can't name anybody she does like 
ttthese days.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI see she built a place up here by 
ttthe river.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttA real palace. She rattles around 
ttalone in that thing--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttShe's done well for herself--on her 
ttown and all--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttSo she tells me three times a week.

tShe looks at him--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttI thought you got through that pretty 
ttwell.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThey cooked the whole thing up without 
ttasking me.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttPeople liked him.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttMost people did, yeah.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttI remember him watching me once. 
ttWhen I was little--before you and I--

tShe shrugs.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttI was on the playground with all the 
ttother kids, but I thought he was 
ttonly looking at me. I was afraid he 
ttwas going to arrest me--he had those 
tteyes, you know--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttWeird what you remember.

tThey walk in silence a moment--

</b>ttYour boy, there--

</b>ttAmado.

</b>ttNice-looking kid.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttHe hates me.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNo--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttWith Paloma, it's more like she pities 
ttand tolerates me- totally age-
ttappropriate. But Amado--he's--he's 
ttnever been book-smart. Had a hard 
tttime learning to read. Me being a 
ttteacher and caring about those things 
ttis like an embarrassment--like a 
ttbetrayal.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttFernando did okay, and he dropped 
ttout--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttFernando wasn't pissed off at 
tteverybody. He just wanted to fix 
tttheir cars.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttIt might just be the age. I spent my 
ttfirst fifteen years trying to be 
ttjust like Buddy and the next fifteen 
tttrying to give him a heart attack.

tShe looks at him--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttSo why did you come back here, Sam?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttGot divorced, I wasn't gonna work 
ttfor my father-in-law anymore. The 
ttfellas down here said they'd back me--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttYou don't want to be Sheriff.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI got to admit it's not what I thought 
ttit'd be. Back When Buddy had it--
tthell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60-
ttroom hotel with bars on the windows.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttIt can happen so sudden, can't it? 
ttBeing left out on your own.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou've got your mother, your kids--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttThey've got me. Different thing.

tThey stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttRemember this?

tPilar looks at the spot. She isn't ready to deal with whatever 
tmemory it brings back--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttI should get back.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttPilar--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttLooks real bad if the teacher's late 
ttfor class. It's really nice to talk 
ttwith you, Sam.

tShe waves and walks away, feeling awkward. Sam watches for a 
tminute, then turns and steps down to the bank, He looks at 
tthe water.

<b>tRIVER SURFACE
</b>
tA little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and 
tdrifts away with the current. We TILT UP to see YOUNG PILAR

tbeside her. They are 14 and 15 years old--It is 1972--

<b>ttttYOUNG SAM
</b>ttYou going to tell her?

<b>ttttYOUNG PILAR
</b>ttYou going to tell him?

</b>ttHe's gonna find out.

<b>ttttYOUNG SAM
</b>ttSo? What's he gonna do, arrest us?

tYoung Pilar frowns, tosses more bark--

</b>ttYou believe that?

tman's BOOTS crunching across the gravel of the parking area. 
tNow and then, the man turns a FLASHLIGHT BEAM on a license 
tplate. The cars are all pre-'72, lots of pickups, and the 
tpatrons are almost all TEENAGERS. Some have turned their 
tpickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch, while others 
thave set lawn furniture out to sit on. We TILT UP slightly 
tto see the glint of a Rio County Sheriff's badge pinned on 
tthe man's shirt. He meets a DEPUTY coming in the other

</b>ttMen worked for Santa Anna down there,

ttwasn't much to feed people on, so in

</b>ttBunny, is that stuff I left in the

ttOr "tightly wound," that was another

ttDoctor's reports, highlight reels,

tMUSIC CONTINUES. Finger closing around the trigger of the 
<b>t.45--
</b>
<b>tHOLLIS
</b>
tMUSIC CONTINUES. Mouth open in horror--

<b>tWADE
</b>
tMUSIC CONTINUES. Eyes burning as he aims--

<b>tBUDDY
</b>
tMUSIC CONTINUES. Stepping in the door, seeing, CALLS OUT--

<b>tYOUNG OTIS
</b>
tMUSIC CONTINUES. Turning to see Buddy--

<b>tWADE
</b>
tBLAM! THWAP! A bullet plows through his neck, knocking him 
tback against the bar.

tMUSIC CONTINUES. His gun falls from his hand--

<b>tYOUNG OTIS
</b>
tHorrified, splattered with the Sheriff's blood. MUSIC 
<b>tCONTINUES--
</b>
<b>tBAR COUNTER
</b>
tMUSIC CONTINUES. Twenty-dollar bills have spilled out of the 
tenvelope and are soaking up blood--

<b>tCU BUDDY
</b>
tCalm and hard-eyed. MUSIC CONTINUES. As he steps forward, we 
tsee his pistol is still in its holster. He reaches out and 
ttakes the .45 from Young Hollis's shaking hand, looks him in 
tthe eye till Hollis looks back, then looks toward Young Otis--

tWe PAN with his gaze to a CLOSE-UP of Otis, back in the 
tPRESENT. The MUSIC FADES--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttSheriff Charley had some real big 
ttfriends in politics then, and if the 
tttruth come out it wasn't going to go 
tteasy on Hollis.
ttt(He shrugs)
ttI don't know why I trusted Buddy 
ttwith it--don't know why he trusted 
ttme. The first time I ever talked 
ttwith him was right there, and then 
ttwith a dead white man leakin' blood 
tton the floor between us. He could 
ttcharm the scales off a rattler, Buddy 
ttDeeds.

<b>tWIDER
</b>
tThis isn't what Sam was expecting. Hollis watches his face--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttThe three of us cleaned up and took 
tthim to the post and put him under. 
ttCan't say I was much help.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttAnd the ten thousand?

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttWidow's benefits. He figured it would 
ttmake the disappearance look better, 
ttand that Mexican gal was just scrapin' 
ttby after Charley killed her man. 
ttThey didn't get hooked up till late--

<b>ttttOTIS
</b>ttTime went on, people liked the story 
ttthat we told better than anything 
ttthe truth might have been.

tSam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where 
tCharley fell. He has a lot of information to deal with--

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttWhat's the call, Sam?

tSam rolls it over in his mind before answering--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttDon't think the Rangers are likely 
ttto find out any more than they  
ttalready have.

<b>ttttHOLLIS
</b>ttWord gets out who that body was, 
ttpeople are gonna think Buddy done 
ttit.

tSam gets up--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttBuddy's a goddamn legend. He can 
tthandle it.

tHe heads for the door--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>tt'Night, fellas.

tHollis and Otis watch him go--

<b>ttttttt FADE OUT:

<b>tEXT. DRIVE-IN, WIDE SHOT -- MORNING

tWe see Sam sitting on the hood of his car parked in the 
tdeserted drive-in lot, staring up at the ruined screen. 
tPilar's car rolls in, parks beside him--

<b>tCLOSER
</b>
tPilar gets out, kisses Sam, sits by him on the hood--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttWhen's the picture start?

tSam looks at her for a moment--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou gonna tell your mother we been 
ttseeing each other?

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttShe'll figure it out sooner or later. 
ttI don't have to ask permission 
ttanymore, if that's what you mean.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou have any idea when your father 
ttdied? Eladio?

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttt(Shrugs)
ttCouple months before I was born--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttTry a year and a half. He bands her 
ttan old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--

tBuddy and Young Mercedes on the lake. Buddy with his shirt 
toff on one end of a sailboat, Mercedes in a bathing suit, 
tboth smiling for the camera--

</b>
tPilar hands the photo back to him, tries to be calm--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttI've never seen my mother in a  
ttbathing suit before.  Didn't know 
ttshe owned one.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttBuddy bought the cafe for her with 
ttmoney he took from the county.    
ttPilar looks away, struggling not to 
ttcry--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttThey can't pull this on me. It isn't 
ttfair--I don't believe this--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHe paid the hospital bill when you 
ttwere born. Your mom always calls you 
tt"our beautiful daughter" in the 
ttletters she wrote to him.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttFrom the first time I saw you at 
ttschool--all those years we were 
ttmarried to other people I always 
ttfelt like we were connected.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI remember thinking you were the one 
ttpart of my life Buddy didn't have a 
ttpiece of--

tA silence, both of them wondering what the next move should 
tbe--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttSo that's it? You're not going to 
ttwant to be with me anymore?

tSam knows what he feels but doesn't have the words--

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttI'm not having any more children. 
ttAfter Amado, I had some complications-- 
ttI can't get pregnant again, if that's 
ttwhat the rule is about--

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttIf I met you for the first time today, 
ttI'd still want to be with you.

tIt is what Pilar needed to hear--

</b>ttYeah--

</b>ttEverything that went before, all 
ttthat stuff, that history--the hell 
ttwith it, right?

tPILAR takes Sam's hand, kisses him--
