<b>  1tINT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
</b>tThe following is shot DOCUMENTARY-STYLE.
tA GIRLS VOLLEYBALL GAME has just ended. It was a big game. Some kind of
tchampionship.

tONE TEAM is CELEBRATING -- jumping up and down, squealing and
thugging each other. We are focused on the bench of the TEAM TRAT
tLOST. They're very sad -- several are crying.
tOne girl, in particular, (AMY) is really sobbing. She's sweat-
tstained, tired and just blubbering. Stuff's coming out of her eyes,
ther nose, her mouth and the camera is seeing it all.

tThe COACH, a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls -- Amy in
tparticular.

<b>tttttCOACH
</b>tttYou quit! You gave up!

tHe KICKS a CHAIR.

tNow Amy is really a mess. She's crying, coughing, shaking.

<b>tttttCOACH (CONT'D)
</b>tttt(right in Amy's face)
tttYou quit!!

tThe Coach storms off.

<b>tttttCOACH (CONT'D)
</b>tttQutters! ... Quitters!

tAmy is wailing and choking on her own tears.

tThis IMAGE FREEZES.

<b>tttttTERRY (V.O.)
</b>tttAnd that would be it. I don't
tttthink you need any narration at
tttall. Just end it right there.

<b>tREVEAL
</b>

<b>  2tINT. OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>tBEGIN CREDITS
</b>
tWe're in New York City. We're in the conference room of a modestly
tsuccessful cable TV station called "Real TV." The people are
tyoung, energetic, clever. It's crowded, noisy -the furniture is
tbeaten up, bulletin boards cover the walls, with large index cards
tall over them.
tThis room is not for show -- work gets done here.

tSEVEN OR EIGHT PEOPLE are present. One of them is CYNTHIA REED.
tShe's the boss.

<b>tttttTERRY
</b>tttt(to Cynthia)
tttWhat do you think?

<b>tttttCYNTHIA
</b>tttIt's horrible, it's depressing, I
tttlove it. What else?

<b>tttttALICE
</b>tttI want to re-pitch that pregnancy
tttidea. Find six women early in their
tttpregnancies and follow them all right
tttthrough to the births.

<b>tttttKEITH
</b>tttt(negative)
tttYeah, when all that stuff comes
tttout.

tMixed reactions, mostly negative.

<b>tttttCYNTHIA
</b>tttI have an idea.

<b>tIMMEDIATE ATTENTION
</b>
<b>tttttCYNTHIA (CONT'D)
</b>tttThis is something I've been thinking
tttabout for a long time. We're "Real
tttTV" right? I mean that's the name
tttof the station.

<b>tAGREEMENT
</b>
<b>tttttCYNTHIA (CONT'D)
</b>tttSo let's go real. We find someone.
tttJust a regular person, someone. And
tttwe put their life on television -
tttlive... all day long.

tSilence. No movement at all.

<b>tttttCYNTHIA (CONT'D)
</b>tttCalm down.

<b>tttttKEITH
</b>tttWhat do you mean, like PBS did in
tttthe seventies? What was that
tttfamily?

<b>tttttGREG
</b>tttThe Louds.

<b>tttttKEITH
</b>tttYeah.

<b>tttttCYNTHIA
</b>tttNo. We go way beyond that. We
tttdon't film it and edit it and put
tttit on later. We go on the air
tttlive every morning and the show
tttgoes off each night, when our
tttsubject goes to bed. In between,
tttwe're on live all day, every day -
tttthe same person, -- for
tttt(shrugs)
tttlet's say a month.

tNo one is wild for this. Some hate it -- some are unconvinced.

<b>tttttFELICIA
</b>tttThat's not a show that's a
tttsurveillance camera.

<b>tttttGREG
</b>tttYou can't do that.

<b>tttttCYNTHIA
</b>tttThe hell we can't. Look, the
tttbeauty of being a cable 
tttchannel is we can take chances. I've
tttthought about this and I'm
ttttelling you, I think this can
tttmake a noise. A loud one. There
tttare twelve thousand channels.
tttYou've got to do something that
tttsays "Look at me!" Hell, people
tttlook at fish tanks all day. This
tttis people!
tttt(more firmly)
tttSomeone's real life -- an TV, all day
tttlong - live... And, you know what?
tttI'm doing it.

tPause. The others know the argument is over.

<b>tttttGREG
</b>tttIn that case, we love it.

<b>tEND CREDITS
</b>

<b>  3tEXT. POOL HALL - DAY
</b>tA BUS passes. On the bus is an ad. It says, "Would you
tlike to star in your own TV show? Call Real TV (and a
tphone number) Coming (and a date)."


<b>  4tINT. POOL HALL - NIGHT - PARAMUS NEW JERSEY
</b>tThis is a nice upscale pool hall. A party is in progress in a
tspecial private area -- a room upstairs let's say -- a loft.
tThirty or forty PEOPLE in their twenties and thirties are
tinformally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends.

tIt's NOISY, it's fun, it's informal. It's not a high-end group.
tBy that we mean, not, for the most part young lawyers or
tstockbrokers. They're mostly blue-collar. Community college
tgraduates.

tWE OPEN ON ED PEKURNY. He's an attractive man, about thirty.
tThere's still something a little juvenile about him -- not
tstupid, just boyish.

tSOMEONE is VIDEOTAPING HIM for one of those congratulation
tmontage things that are done at parties these days. Ed is good
tat this. He's not professional but he's a loosey-goosey guy
twho's kind of good on camera.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttI want to congratulate
tttKevin and Tracy on their engagement.
tttI knew you guys were meant for each
tttother from the moment Tracy told us
tttshe was pregnant.

<b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttYou asshole!

tEveryone else is cracking up.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttt(innocently)
tttWhat? What did I say?

<b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttMy mother's going to see this!


<b>  5tINT. PARTY - LATER
</b>tOther people are being "interviewed" on tape. Ed is SHOOTING POOL
twith his buddy, JOHN. John's had a couple of drinks. He's a little
tmelancholy.

tHe is looking across the room, thoughtfully.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWhat?

<b>tttttJOHN
</b>tttLook at this -- people are
tttgetting married, they're
tttgetting married...

<b>tttttED
</b>tttYou said that.

<b>tttttJOHN
</b>tttWe're falling behind.

tEd waves dismissively.

<b>tttttJOHN (CONT'D)
</b>tttYou know who we are?

<b>tttttED
</b>tttTell me.

<b>tttttJOHN
</b>tttWe're the guys who clean up after
tttthe parade.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttI'm gonna stick this right in your
ttteye.

<b>tttttJOHN
</b>tttI was at this comedy club last week
tttand this comedian says "If you're over
tttthirty and your job requires you to
tttwear a name tag, you screwed up your
tttlife." And I'm laughing and then I
tttrealize I wear a nametag.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttSo do I. So what? I'm doing all right.

<b>tttttJOHN
</b>tttYour brother's here.

<b>tANGLE ON THE DOOR
</b>
tEd's brother RAY and Ray's girlfriend SHARI arrive at the party.
tShari is pretty in an unglamorous kind of way. They both wave and
tthen Shari goes off to talk to some of the LADIES and Ray joins Ed
tand John.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttWhat's up?

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWhere were you?

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttt(reluctantly)
tttI was... having dinner with Shari
tttand her parents.

<b>tttttJOHN/ED
</b>tttt(taunting)
tttOooh!

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttI'm telling you, it's
tttclosing in on me. All of a sudden
tttit's like a thing, it's a whole
tttthing.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWhat do you mean all
tttof a sudden? You've been going with
ttther six months.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttI know. I mean I'm sitting there
tttand her father's asking me about
tttmy "career prospects" and I'm
tttplaying "Risk," with her kid
tttbrother, Leon and at dinner the
tttdog's sniffing at my balls -- at
tttleast I hope it was the dog.
ttt'Cause her mother disappeared for
ttta while.

tThey LAUGH.


<b>  6tINT. PARTY - LATER
</b>tIt's getting wild. Some of the girls are dancing raucously.

<b>tANGLE ON A TABLE (NOT A POOL TABLE, AN EATING-TABLE)
</b>
tEd, Ray, John, Shari and maybe another WOMAN.

tRay is holding a big tray of SHRIMP BALLS. During the
tconversation, Ray throws them in the air and catches them in
this mouth like popcorn. Once, he even bounces one off the
twall into his mouth.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttYou know, those are for everybody.

tRay waves dismissively, then gets an idea.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttOh!
tttt(to Shari)
tttShow them that thing you can do.
tttt(to the others)
tttThis is great. I just found out
tttshe can do this, her brother told me.
tttt(to Shari)
tttCome on.

<b>tttttSHARI
</b>tttt(thinks it's stupid)
tttI don't -

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttCome on...

tShe hesitates, but she really doesn't mind. Slightly, amused she
ttakes her FIST and fits it completely INTO her MOUTH.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWhoa!! Oh!

tRay is cracking up.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttIs that unbelievable?

tShe removes her hand.

<b>tttttSHARI
</b>tttAnd that concludes today's show.
tttt(to Ray)
tttThis is where you go around and
tttcollect the money.

tEd LAUGHS. Ray gives her a KISS.

tShari's roommate RITA sits down.

<b>tttttRITA
</b>tttHi.

<b>tttttSHARI
</b>tttYou guys know my roommate, Rita.

tThey do, vaguely.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWhat's going on over there?

<b>tttttRITA
</b>tttEverybody's making
tttaudition tapes for that Real TV
tttthing.

<b>tttttJOHN
</b>tttOh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear
tttabout this?

<b>tttttED
</b>tttt(not sure)
tttYeah, what - they put some schmuck
ttton TV all day long or something?

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttYou know, that would be like a great
tttthing.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWhat?

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttThat! Being that guy.
tttBeing the guy they watch.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWhat are you drunk?

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttYeah, but let's stay
ttton one subject. Whoever that person
tttis is going to be famous. They'll be
tttable to get whatever they want.
tttThey'll ... trust me, this is my
tttbusiness.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWhat is?!

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttShow business.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttYou're in show business?

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttYeah. I service video equipment.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttThat's like... those people
tttstitching Nikes in Panama saying
tttthey're in the NBA.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttt(insulted)
tttI'm not stitching Nikes in
tttPanama! ... Bedwetter!

<b>tttttED
</b>tttThumbsucker!

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttI'm making a tape.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWe're excited.


<b>  7tINT. BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>tEd and Shari, waiting for drink orders.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttSo Ray met the family.

<b>tttttSHARI
</b>tttYeah...

<b>tttttED
</b>tttI hear the dog really liked him.

<b>tttttSHARI
</b>tttOh, the whole family loved him.
tttOf course, they loved the last
tttguy I went out with, and he strung
tttme along for three years and dumped
tttme.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttReally? You see, to me, you shouldn't
ttthave any trouble with men. There
tttshould be, like, a line behind you.

tShe takes Ed's beer.

<b>tttttSHARI
</b>tttYou shouldn't drink.

tThey LAUGH.


<b>  8tINT. TABLE - A LITTLE LATER
</b>tEd and Shari ARM-WRESTLING. After a struggle, Ed wins. Ed is
timpressed.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttJesus!

tShari wrings out her arm and picks up her beer.

<b>tttttSHARI
</b>tttt(continuing a previous
ttttconversation)
tttAnd, you know, every guy I ever
tttbroke up with, the minute it was
tttover, I could tell you what went
tttwrong, how it went wrong, why it
ttthad to go wrong... but when I'm
tttin it... lost. I'm like a love
tttcoroner. Bring me the corpse,
tttI'11 tell you what killed it.
tttBut how to prevent it? Lost.

tEd LAUGHS.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttRay's on.

tThey walk over.

<b>tANGLE ON RAY
</b>
<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttt(to camera)
tttHi. I'm Ray Pekurney. I'm from
tttParamus, New Jersey...


<b>  9tINT. CYNTHIA'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>tShe's watching Ray's tape. Ray thinks he's funnier and
tcuter than he is.

<b>tttttRAY (ON TAPE)
</b>tttAll my friends tell me "Ray, you've
tttgot too much personality for one guy."
tttIt's like at a party -- I'm at the
tttcenter of the attention. Everybody
tttloves me.

tHe gets hit in the face by a hors d'oeuvre.

<b>tttttRAY (CONT'D)
</b>tttHa, ha, ha. I'll kick your ass.
tttNo really, let me show you my
tttgirlfriend. She's really cute.

tHe reaches out and grabs Shari's wrist. Shari is struggling
tto stay out of frame. We just see her arm and Ray pulling on
tit. Ray lets go.

<b>tttttRAY (CONT'D)
</b>tttShe's strong, 'cause she's a Fedex
tttgirl. She lifts those
tttpackages. But she's not dikey at
tttall, she's really pretty.

<b>tCYNTHIA FAST-FORWARDS
</b>
tWE SEE the camera shooting an empty space.

tThen Ed's head appears sideways right in front of the CAMERA.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttHello I'm Ed.

tHe starts to sniff.

<b>tttttED (CONT'D)
</b>tttWhat smells?

tHe steps back from the camera and straightens his head as
the SNIFFS. He's more relaxed than Ray.

<b>tttttED (CONT'D)
</b>tttWhat is that smell? Oop, I think
tttit's this idea. One person on TV all
tttday long?
tttt(screams)
tttAre you nuts?

<b>tWE HEAR LAUGHS
</b>
tThe Real TV Staff are enjoying Ed's tape while they eat
tlunch out of styrofoam containers.

<b>tttttED (CONT'D)
</b>tttSeriously, get your resumes in
tttorder. When my brother Ray -
tttwhose personality you were just
tttdazzled by -- told me he was
tttgoing to try out for this -- I
tttsaid, "why in the world would
tttanyone want to be on TV all day
tttlong, no privacy, everybody
tttknowing your business, exposing
tttevery single detail of your
tttlife I mean... why would anyone
tttwant to do that? But then I
tttthought of a reason...
tttt(loudly)
tttWhy the hell not?

tHe KISSES the LENS, smudging it.

tCynthia, watching, cracks up. The others seem to like him to.


<b>  10    INT. VIDEO STORE - DAY
</b>tThis is a video store in Paramus, New Jersey. It's busy.
tPEOPLE are in line to check out tapes.

tWE OPEN ON a WOMAN -- a mother -- who is rummaging through her
tpurse for her Blockbuster card. She looks up and sees that her
tTWO CHILDREN have opened several boxes of candy from the candy
tdisplay and are eating from the boxes.

<b>tttttMOTHER
</b>tttOh for -- Put those -- Oh God...

tShe grabs the boxes from them. The boxes are ripped more than she
tthought and candy goes flying all over. She bends to pick it up.

tEd appears. He works here.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttt(to the Mom)
tttWe'11 take care of it.

tSomeone arrives with a broom.

<b>tttttED (CONT'D)
</b>tttt(to the broom guy)
tttHere. This time throw it out, don't
ttteat it.

tLOU, the Manager passes.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttLou, can I talk to you a second?

tLou seems like he'd prefer to avoid this.

<b>tttttLOU
</b>tttUm, yeah, I was gonna ...

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWhat's the deal?
tttDid anybody make a decision -

<b>tttttLOU
</b>tttEd, look, uh... you're not getting
tttthe job. They're gonna transfer
tttsomeone from another store to manage
tttthis store when I leave to manage
tttthe new store. I'm sorry.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttOh, Christ. Did you go to bat for
tttme?

<b>tttttLOU
</b>tttI batted!

<b>tttttED
</b>tttYou batted or you bunted?

<b>tttttLOU
</b>tttHey. I went as far as I felt
tttcomfortable. I mean, you know,
tttlet's face it -- you come and go
ttthere as you please. You work
tttwhen you feel like it -- you
tttknow, Bruce Springsteen's
tttbirthday is not a legal holiday.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttWell, then I'm quitting.

<b>tttttLOU
</b>tttEd, come on. What's that gonna do?
tttYou're gonna bring Blockbuster to
ttttheir knees. Let me recommend a movie
tttto you. It's called "Get your shit
ttttogether before it's too late."

<b>tttttED
</b>tttt(wise-ass)
tttWho's in it?

<b>tttttCLERK
</b>tttEd, telephone.

tEd goes to the phone.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttt(into the phone)
tttYeah... Are you serious? ... Come
ttton, no kidding, who is this? ...
tttHoly shit!


<b>  11    INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
</b>tEd is being interviewed by the "Real TV" staff whom we met earlier.
tHe's slightly less comfortable than on his tape, but he's good.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttI had one year of college. And
tttthen one year of junior college.

<b>tttttCYNTHIA (O.C.)
</b>tttWhat did you study?

<b>tttttED
</b>tttOh, see, studying
tttwould've been a huge help. Where
tttwere you, then?

tThey LAUGH.

<b>ttttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>  11A   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
</b>
<b>tttttED
</b>tttWell, there's Ray, my
tttbrother. He's... ambitious. Like a
tttfew years ago, he started this
tttmobile dog-grooming business. But,
tttlike, out of his Camry. He had this
tttbathtub in his trunk -
tttt(Ed starts cracking up)
ttthe's throwing the dogs in there, they're
tttfighting and splashing, then he'd
tttslam the trunk down, let 'em run
tttaround inside screaming getting all
tttwet... then he'd use the car
tttexhaust to dry'em.
tttt(wiping his eyes)
tttAh, Ray... he just can't get a
tttbreak.

<b>ttttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>  11B   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
</b>
<b>tttttED
</b>tttMy sister -- Marcia, I
tttmean she can't get a break. About
tttseven years ago she falls in love
tttwith this Vietnamese guy who wants
tttto marry her so he can stay in the
tttcountry. So they get married, they
ttthave a kid, he gets his citizenship,
tttimmediately divorces my sister and
tttmarries this Vietnamese woman who,
ttthe was probably already married to
tttall along. She can pick 'em.
tttt(pause)
tttShe's got a nice
tttlittle boy, though. My nephew, Andy.

<b>ttttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>  11C   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
</b>
<b>tttttED
</b>tttMy Mom's okay. Kinda.
tttI knew a guy who hated his mother -
tttStuey Shwam. He hated his mother so
tttmuch, he had his belly button
tttremoved.

<b>ttttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>  11D   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
</b>
<b>tttttED
</b>tttNo, I've never been married.

tThe interviewer seems to be waiting for him to elaborate.
tHe doesn't. He shrugs -- that's it.

<b>ttttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>  11E   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
</b>
<b>tttttED
</b>tttOh, my father -what an asshole. When I was

tttthe last I heard of him.

<b>ttttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

tttthere, you know... I mean, I'm
tttthirty-one... I'm not sure I
tttwant to be a video store clerk
tttwhen I'm forty... Of course, I
tttdidn't expect to be doing it
ttt'til I was thirty-one, either.
tttBut... you know I'm... keeping
tttmy options open. Anything comes
tttalong, I'm ready to pounce.
tttt(growls like a cougar)

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

</b>
<b>tttttED
</b>tttA dream? Of course I have a
tttdream I just don't know what
tttthe hell it is.
tttt(shrugs and smiles)


tEd's image freezes, while he has a funny-cute expression on
this face.

tPULL BACK TO REVEAL a TV in a conference room with Ed's
tfrozen image on it. Cynthia is there with her bosses, the
tpeople who run the network that owns Real TV. The top man is
tMR. SCHARLACH. His deputies are MS. SEAVER and MR. McILVAINE.
tThis is not the same place where we met Cynthia and her
tstaff. This is richer, more corporate and formal.

<b>tttttCYNTHIA
</b>tttHe's who we want to go with.

<b>tttttSCHARLACH
</b>tttt(doubtfully)
tttThis guy.

<b>tttttCYNTHIA
</b>tttI polled my
tttstaff. The men say they'd hang
tttaround with him and the women say
ttthe's fuckable. And one of the men
tttsaid he's fuckable.

<b>tttttSCHARLACH
</b>tttI'm not
tttsure about the entire concept.

tCynthia is frustrated.

<b>tttttCYNTHIA
</b>tttLook it's not like we're 
tttburning up the airwaves
tttnow. We're running neck-and-neck
tttwith The Gardening Channel. If
tttpeople just tune in to this twice a
tttday for five minutes, we're a hit.
tttPlus we can sell advertising every
tttsecond, running at the bottom of the
tttscreen... and the beauty is this guy
tttdoesn't even have to be good. I mean
tttif he's good, great. But if he winds
tttup making an ass of himself, better.

tttttMcILVAINE
tttHow is that better?

<b>tttttCYNTHIA
</b>tttCome on. People cannot turn away
tttfrom an accident. You drive by,
tttyou say "Ooh, I hope there's not
ttta head lying in the road" but you
tttlook ! See, nobody in America
tttwants to be nobody. This guy
tttwants to be famous. So,
tttbasically, the deal is he agrees
tttto drive down the highway a
ttthundred miles an hour blindfolded
tttand we get to see if his head
tttwinds up rolling down the
ttthighway. Fun for the whole
tttfamily. So let's do it.

tShe stops, waiting for approval.
