</b><b>t
</b><b>tFADE IN:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.
</b><b>t
</b>tThe colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression
tof looking through a kaleidoscope.
<b>t
</b>tAs the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are
tinside a CANDY BOWL.  A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically
tremoving all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tThe man performing this curious task is
twriter/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,
tconservatively dressed in suit and tie.  He sits alone at an
tempty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,
tsome distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
tthe table's paper cloth.
<b>t
</b>tViktor finishes sorting.  Finding no trash can to deposit the
trejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
<b>t
</b>tA young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches.  He looks
till.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    P.A.
</b>t          Mr. Taransky --
<b>t
</b>tViktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          She's walking?... Don't tell me
t          she's walking.
t              (blood slowly draining
t               from his face)
t          She is not walking... She can't
t          walk.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  TRAILER - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tNICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful
tface scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
tfrom a movie trailer to a limousine.  VIKTOR desperately
tfollows after Nicola.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          -- Nicola!  How was your massage?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NICOLA
</b>t          You're in breach.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          -- Is this about the new pages? --
t          I made the changes you wanted,
t          you're in virtually every scene --
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NICOLA
</b>t              (wheeling on him)
t          It's not the size of the role,
t          Viktor.
t              (suddenly very cool)
t          Am I or am I not contractually
t          entitled to the biggest trailer on
t          the set?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t              (regarding the enormous
t               silver fish behind them,
t               confused)
t          It's the biggest on earth!  I
t          swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream --
t          they don't make them any longer
t          than that.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NICOLA
</b>t          Taller, Viktor.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          Taller?  What?
<b>t
</b>tViktor looks up in horror.  The trailer next to Nicola's does
tindeed appear to be fractionally taller.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NICOLA
</b>t              (walking away)
t          You've insulted me for the last
t          time.
<b>t
</b>tViktor looks to the tires.  His face suddenly brightens.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          Nicola, it's just the tires --
t          they're over-inflated!  I can fix
t          it!
<b>t
</b>tViktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
tstabbing at it with a ballpoint pen.  Air hisses out.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          See, it's lower already.
<b>t
</b>tNicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her
tPUBLICIST.  Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          I beg you.  You can't do this to
t          me.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NICOLA
</b>t              (looking back)
t          I had three other offers.  I only
t          signed on to this picture out of...
t          loyalty.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          Then show some.  They'll shut me
t          down!
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NICOLA
</b>t              (opening the car door)
t          It wasn't working anyhow.  The
t          scene with the thousand geese -- I
t          don't understand this film.  I
t          don't think anyone will understand
t          it.  I already put out a press
t          release -- citing "creative
t          differences".
<b>t
</b>tViktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          You know what, Nicola, you're
t          right.
t              (picking up her last piece
t               of luggage)
t          Here, let me help you with that.
t              (holding the door for her)
t          You ought to go.  The truth is I
t          don't deserve you.  This film
t          doesn't deserve you.  Frankly, it
t          deserves much, much better.  The
t          reason it's not working is because
t          you're not about the work.
<b>t
</b>tNicola is stunned.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t              (to the limo driver)
t          To Hell, please.
<b>t
</b>tThe door slams and the limo roars away.  Viktor looks to the
tstill hissing trailer tire.  The CREW regards Viktor
tapprehensively.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t              (to the crew)
t          What are you looking at?  Get back
t          to work.
<b>t
</b>tThe crew is uncertain what work there is to do.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a
tveil of netting.  A distraught man, HAL, sits close by.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NICOLA
</b>t              (whispered)
t          Jack... are you there?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    HAL
</b>t          I'm here.  I'm right beside you.
<b>t
</b>tA NUN enters.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NUN
</b>t              (to Hal)
t          You should really go now.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NICOLA
</b>t          No, it's alright.  Please, let him
t          stay.
<b>t
</b>tThe nun withdraws.  Hal holds his face in his hands, almost
tbreaking down.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    HAL
</b>t              (a glance to heaven)
t          What kind of cruel God is it that
t          would take you away from me?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NICOLA
</b>t          The same one who brought me to you.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    HAL
</b>t          No... I cannot accept it.  If
t          something like this can happen. 
t          What...
t              (struggling to find the
t               words)
t          What is it for?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    NICOLA
</b>t              (smiles through her pain)
t          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
t          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
t          here?  No why.  Just here.
<b>t
</b>tNicola dies peacefully.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tVIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio
thead ELAINE CHRISTIAN, watching a rough assembly of the film. 
tIt ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.
<b>t
</b>tThe lights go up.  The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    EXECUTIVE 1
</b>t          She's good.  You can hardly tell
t          she's reading off a teleprompter.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t              (ignoring him)
t          I've analyzed the footage.  We've
t          got almost everything we need in
t          the can.  If we rework the script,
t          we can finish the film without her.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    EXECUTIVE 2
</b>t              (forceful shake of the
t               head)
t          According to the writ her attorneys
t          filed at noon today.  They'll sue
t          if the film is released with Nicola
t          in a single frame.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t              (more anxious)
t          So we'll re-cast.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    HAL
</b>t          Nicola Anders is the only actress
t          who can play that role.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t              (incredulous)
t          It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not
t          bigger than this picture.
<b>t
</b>tElaine finally speaks up.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ELAINE
</b>t          Of course she is.  No other name is
t          going to sign on now and risk
t          offending her.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          We don't need a name.  We'll cast
t          an unknown.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    HAL
</b>t          I won't play opposite an unknown.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ELAINE
</b>t          We can't sell an unknown.  Nicola's
t          soured on the project and we have
t          to accept that.  If we ever want to
t          be in the Nicola Anders business
t          again, we have to cut our losses
t          and shelve the picture.
<b>t
</b>tThe executives, leading man and director nod sagely.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t              (aghast)
t          No!  You will not give in to that
t          blackmailing bitch!
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ELAINE
</b>t              (a wince, addressing
t               everyone but Viktor)
t          Excuse us.
<b>t
</b>tElaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous
tsoundstage.  They speak more freely in each other's company.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ELAINE
</b>t          God, Viktor.  Why do you always
t          have to make things so difficult
t          for yourself?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          Difficult.  I'm difficult.
<b>t
</b>tHe produces a handful of candy from his pocket.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t              (referring to the candy)

t          Elaine?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ELAINE
</b>t              (talking a piece of candy

t          Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry
t          Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I,
t          Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy
t          Award nominated director --
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ELAINE

<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          -- overseeing the most cherished
t          movie project of my career, am

<b>t
</b>tElaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ELAINE
</b>t          -- I have a feeling you're going to

<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          -- I'll tell you why.  It is
t          because Miss Nicola Anders,
t          supermodel with a SAG card God's
t          gift to cinema, has it written into
t          her contract that all cherry Mike &
t          Ike's be removed from her candy
t          dish along with strict instructions
t          that any room she walks into should
t          have seven packs of cigarettes
t          waiting for her three of them
t          opened, that there be a personal
t          jacuzzi within eighty paces of her
t          dressing room, and that any time

<b>t
</b><b>t                    ELAINE

t              (grabbing her arm)
t          Don't you see?  We're being held
t          hostage by 12 men and 5 women who

<b>t
</b><b>t                    ELAINE
</b>t          It's the truth.  Those 17

<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          We can hardly make a profit with

t          We're at their mercy.
t              (staring wistful, into
t               space)
t          We always had movie stars but they
t          used to be our stars.  We used to
t          decide who would play what role. 
t          We told them what to wear, what to
t          say, who to date.  When they were

</b>tOn the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR.  The red

tplaying ON THE SCREEN.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>tThe cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
ta small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a

tblood actress.
<b>t
</b>tSimone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --
ttitled "VISUAL LOOP 6".  Within the confines of the monitor
tshe is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal.  She looks a

<b>t
</b>tViktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own
tamusement.  He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.
<b>t

tdead, that comprise Simone.

</b>tViktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
tdedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal
tdeliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".

</b>tG)  In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open
t    a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny
t    rocket.
<b>t
</b>tH)  VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and
t    scatters it on the counter.
<b>t
</b>tI)  VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush
t    bouncing into the toilet bowl.  He retrieves it.
<b>t
</b>tJ)  VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a
t    jam of PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS has congregated outside the
t    rear entrance.
<b>t
</b>tK)  VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size
t    shadow on the drapes.  A "walking" silhouette is visible
t    to the media on the street.
<b>t
</b>tL)  VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I
<b>t    LOVE YOU V--".
</b><b>t

</b>tA)  MAX enters the bathroom.  He picks up a drinking glass
t    and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed
t    plastic bag.
<b>t
</b>tB)  MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places
t    it in a plastic bag.
<b>t
</b>tC)  MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips
t    before placing it in a plastic bag.
<b>t
</b>tD)  MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.
<b>t
</b>tE)  MAX enters the bedroom.  He carefully removes a slip from
t    a pillow.  He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe
t    in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.
<b>t
</b>tF)  Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed.

</b>t          No, not that.  I was just wondering

</b>t          I got them to remove the

<b>t
</b><b>t                    ELAINE

t          I just think actors talk too much.

</b>t          Why?  So I can tell my friends at

t          life somehow.  What's Simone going
t          to say to a fourteen-year-old
t          anyhow?  She's going to be polite
t          because you're my father but we're
t          not suddenly going to become
t          friends -- we have nothing in
t          common.  It's not going to be real. 
t          Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
t          my head every day.  Why kill the
t          dream?  What do they say, "don't

</b>tThe front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large

<b>t

t    beat up reel of 16mm film.
<b>t
</b>t    MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.

<b>t

<b>t
</b>tC)  Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.
<b>t
</b>t    ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty
t    farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging

<b>t
</b>t    The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into
t    spontaneous applause.
<b>t

<b>t
</b>tE)  In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds
t    wrinkles to Simone.
<b>t
</b>tF)  SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote
t    on a TV screen.  However, her squeaky-clean image has
t    gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking
t    during the interview.  The HOSTS are smiling weakly.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    HOST

t          live on in the public's heart like
t          all the other tragic figures that
t          went before their time.  There's no

<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t                    VIKTOR
</b>t          I know what you're thinking.  It's
t          a phoney-baloney world.  The women

t          than the people who adore you.
t              (a trace of despair)
t          And that's the problem.  You're

t          but if that was the truth, it
t          wouldn't matter to me -- and it
t          does.  It wasn't that the artists
t          had no respect for the art.  They
t          had no respect for me.  Someone
t          like you, you have so much love
t          showered on you -- I just wanted to
t          feel one tiny drop on my face.  I'm
t          sorry, Simone.  Here I've been
t          trying to convince the world that
t          you exist, but I was really trying
t          to convince them that I exist. 
t          It's not that you aren't human,
t          Simone, it's that I am.
<b>t
</b>tViktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver.
t8.1".  He places the disc in the machine.
<b>t
</b>tViktor sees that Simone is crying.  He touches a tear on his
town face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.
<b>t
</b>tViktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses
t"ENTER".  The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to
tdeconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold. 
tThe pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen
tlike dust.  Finally, the dust is blown away in a single
tdigital breath.
<b>t
</b>tFor a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on
this own desk.
<b>t
</b>tViktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen. 
tHis hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc
tmarked, "SIMULATION ONE".
<b>t

thundreds of discs relating to Simone's software.  He shuts
