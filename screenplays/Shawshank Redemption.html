<b>1tINT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 
</b>
tA dark, empty room. 

tThe door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and 
tgiggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than 
tthey're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at 
tflesh, mouths locked together. 

tHe gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over 
tinstead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like 
tgetting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She 
tarches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against 
tthe wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. 

tHe enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the 
twall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not 
tcaring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with 
tthe sensations running through her. He carries her across the 
troom with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed. 

tCAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling 
tsmoothly outside... 

<b>2tEXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2
</b>
t...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the 
tlovers' cries spilling into the night... 

t...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting 
tpassion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of 
tcrickets and hoot owls... 

t...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and
tincongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until... 

t...a car is revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked in a clearing. 

<b>3tINT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3
</b>
tANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit. 
tUnder normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly
tdangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far 
tfrom normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A 
tcigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are 
triveted to the bungalow up the path. 

tHe can hear them fucking from here. 

tHe raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio 
tplays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: 

ttYou stepped out of a dream... 
ttYou are too wonderful... 
ttTo be what you seem... 

tHe opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped
tin a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --

t-- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil. 

tHe grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over 
tthe seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, 
tloading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. 
tSix in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. 

tHe shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant 
tlovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then 
topens the door and steps from the car. 

<b>4tEXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4
</b>
tHis wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to 
tthe ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. 

tHe starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he 
tgets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more 
tfrenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of 
tpassion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts. 

<b>ttttWOMAN (O.S.) 
</b>ttOh god...oh god...oh god... 

tAndy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in 
torgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He 
tshuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. 

tIt finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left 
tis the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear 
tlanguorous laughter, moans of satisfaction. 

<b>ttttWOMAN (O.S.) 
</b>ttOh god...that's sooo good...you're 
ttthe best...the best I ever had... 

tAndy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like 
tmuch of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt 
tpath in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun 
theld loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really.

tTHE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, 
tpale-faced and stupefied. 

<b>ttttD.A. (O.S.) 
</b>ttMr. Dufresne, describe the 
ttconfrontation you had with your 
ttwife the night she was murdered. 

<b>tANDY DUFRESNE 
</b>
tis on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, 
thair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones: 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttIt was very bitter. She said she 
ttwas glad I knew, that she hated all 
ttthe sneaking around. She said she 
ttwanted a divorce in Reno. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttWhat was your response? 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttI told her I would not grant one. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttt(refers to his notes) 
ttI'll see you in Hell before I see
ttyou in Reno. Those were the words 
ttyou used, Mr. Dufresne, according 
ttto the testimony of your neighbors. 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttIf they say so. I really don't 
ttremember. I was upset. 

<b>tFADE TO BLACK: 2ND TITLE UP 
</b>
<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttWhat happened after you and your 
ttwife argued? 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttShe packed a bag and went to stay 
ttwith Mr. Quentin. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttGlenn Quentin. The golf pro at the 
ttFalmouth Hills Country Club. The 
ttman you had recently discovered was 
tther lover. 
ttt(Andy nods) 
ttDid you follow her? 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttI went to a few bars first. Later, 
ttI decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's 
tthome and confront them. They 
ttweren't there...so I parked my car 
ttin the turnout...and waited. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttWith what intention? 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttI'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. 
ttI think mostly I wanted to scare them. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttYou had a gun with you? 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttYes. I did. 

<b>tFADE TO BLACK: 3RD TITLE UP 
</b>
<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttWhen they arrived, you went up 
ttto the house and murdered them? 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttNo. I was sobering up. I realized 
ttshe wasn't worth it. I decided to 
ttlet her have her quickie divorce. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttQuickie divorce indeed. A .38 
ttcaliber divorce, wrapped in a 
tthandtowel to muffle the shots, 
ttisn't that what you mean? And then 
ttyou shot her lover! 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttI did not. I got back in the car 
ttand drove home to sleep it off. 
ttAlong the way, I stopped and threw 
ttmy gun into the Royal River. I feel 
ttI've been very clear on this point. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttYes, you have. Where I get hazy, 
ttthough, is the part where the 
ttcleaning woman shows up the next 
ttmorning and finds your wife and her 
ttlover in bed, riddled with .38 
ttcaliber bullets. Does that strike 
ttyou as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. 
ttDufresne, or is it just me? 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttt(softly) 
ttYes. It does. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttI'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't 
ttthink the jury heard that. 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttYes. It does. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttDoes what? 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttStrike me as a fantastic coincidence. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttOn that, sir, we are in accord... 

<b>tFADE TO BLACK! 4TH TITLE UP 
</b>
<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttYou claim you threw your gun into 
ttthe Royal River before the murders 
tttook place. That's rather convenient. 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttIt's the truth. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttYou recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? 
ttHe and his men dragged that river 
ttfor three days and nary a gun was 
ttfound. So no comparison can be made 
ttbetween your gun and the bullets 
tttaken from the bloodstained corpses 
ttof the victims. That's also rather 
ttconvenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne? 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttt(faint, bitter smile) 
ttSince I am innocent of this crime, 
ttsir, I find it decidedly inconvenient 
ttthe gun was never found. 

<b>tFADE TO BLACK: STH TITLE UP 
</b>
<b>6tINT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 6
</b>
tThe D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation:

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttLadies and gentlemen, you've heard 
ttall the evidence, you know all the 
ttfacts. We have the accused at the 
ttscene of the crime. We have foot 
ttprints. Tire tracks. Bullets 
ttscattered on the ground which bear 
tthis fingerprints. A broken bourbon 
ttbottle, likewise with fingerprints. 
ttMost of all, we have a beautiful 
ttyoung woman and her lover lying 
ttdead in each other's arms. They had 
ttsinned. But was their crime so 
ttgreat as to merit a death sentence? 

tHe gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttI suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to 
ttthat would be yes. I further 
ttsuspect he carried out that 
ttsentence on the night of September 
tt21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, 
ttby pumping four bullets into his 
ttwife and another four into Glenn 
ttQuentin. And while you think about 
ttthat, think about this... 

tHe picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes 
tlike a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune. 

<b>ttttD.A. 
</b>ttA revolver holds six bullets, not 
tteight. I submit to you this was not 
tta hot-blooded crime of passion! 
ttThat could at least be understood, 
ttif not condoned. No, this was 
ttrevenge of a much more brutal and 
ttcold-blooded nature. Consider! Four 
ttbullets per victim! Not six shots 
ttfired, but eight! That means he 
ttfired the gun empty...and then 
ttstopped to reload so he could shoot 
tteach of them again! An extra bullet 
ttper lover...right in the head. 
ttt(a few JURORS shiver) 
ttI'm done talking. You people are 
ttall decent, God-fearing Christian 
ttfolk. You know what to do.

ta nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county, 
tsmacking greasy lips and gnawing cobbettes of corn.

</b>ttYou strike me as a particularly icy 
ttand remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

ttyou to serve two life sentences,

</b>
tRED enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair.

</b>ttYou feel you've been rehabilitated?

</b>ttYes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned

tHigh stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at
tintervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are 
tin the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each 
tother, making deals. Exercise period. 



tRED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the 
tactivity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing 
tminor business. He's an important man here. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttThere's a con like me in every prison 
ttin America, I guess. I'm the guy who 
ttcan get it for you. Cigarettes, a

ttbottle of brandy to celebrate your

</b>ttSo when Andy Dufresne came to me in

tRed is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. 
tMost cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his 
tgroup mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably. 

<b>11tINT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1947) 11

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttAndy came to Shawshank Prison in 
ttearly 1947 for murdering his wife 
ttand the fella she was bangin'. 

tThe bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes 
taround, swallowed by prison walls. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttOn the outside, he'd been vice-

ttGood work for a man as young as he 
ttwas, when you consider how

<b>ttttTOWER GUARD 
</b>ttAll clear! 

tGUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. 
tThe new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking 
tsourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in 
tfront of him, almost drags him down. 

tBYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into 
tAndy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS

<b>ttttRED 
</b>ttThat's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. 
ttAny takers? 

tMore hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, 
tforced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching 
tunder the barrage of jeers and shouts. The old-timers are 
tshaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their 
tpants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look 
tterrified. Especially Andy. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttI must admit I didn't think much of

ttHe might'a been important on the

tHadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the

tSeconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out.

tFat-Ass keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freak-out. Hadley 
tdraws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it. 

tA GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls Fat-Ass out and starts 
tbeating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. Fat-Ass 
tfalls, tries to crawl. 

tThe place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull

ttheir head-counts to the HEAD BULL, who jots on a clipboard.

tby. Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, 
tmutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs. 

tAndy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses
ta spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their 
tstares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something
tin his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers. 

tIt's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with
tit. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's
ta senior citizen, a long-standing resident. 

<b>ttttBROOKS 
</b>ttYou gonna eat that? 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttHadn't planned on it.

</b>ttYou mind? 

tAndy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling
tit between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine 
tcigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension. 

<b>ttttBROOKS 
</b>ttMmm. Nice and ripe. 

tAndy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and 
tfeeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket.
tAndy breathes a sigh of relief.

</b>ttMornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. 
ttYou know why it's fine?

<b>ttttHEYWOOD 
</b>ttThat's right, send 'em all down. I

<b>34tINT -- SHOWERS -- DAY (1947) 34

tHeywood and Jigger pause, watching.

</b>ttAin't made up my mind yet. 

tHeywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the
tball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of
tthe corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends
tthe ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood
tdrops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttI understand you're a man who knows 
tthow to get things. 

<b>ttttRED 
</b>ttI'm known to locate certain things 
ttfrom time to time. They seem to

</b>ttYou make your customers' motives a

</b>ttIf you wanted a toothbrush, I 
ttwouldn't ask questions. I'd just 
ttquote a price. A toothbrush, see, 
ttis a non-lethal sort of object. 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttFair enough. A rock-hammer is about 
tteight or nine inches long. Looks 
ttlike a miniature pickaxe, with a 
ttsmall sharp pick on one end, and a 
ttblunt hammerhead on the other. It's 
ttfor rocks. 

<b>ttttRED 
</b>ttRocks. 

tAndy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of
tdirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and
trubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red.

<b>ttttRED 
</b>ttQuartz?

ttBut it's a waste of money.

tAndy trips on some old gaint sugglies. That's all it takes.

tAndy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from

tan old four-pocket machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams 
ta rag into Andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like 
ta horse bit. Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete 
thave his arms firmly pinned. Bogs whispers in Andy's ear:

tstarving man exploring packages of food. He doesn't know where 
tto turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling

tHe rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph

tAndy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping

tHe slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the

tShawshank is half a mile distant. WE TRACK ALONG a muddy creel
tas STATE TROOPERS and PRISON GUARDS scour the brush. A TROOPEE
tfishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.)

ttset of prison clothes, a bar of

tOnce again, we see Andy using the rock-hammer to scratch his

tpops free and hits the floor. He stares down at it. 

<b>232tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 232

tAndy lies in the dark, studying the chunk of concrete in his 
thands. Considering the possibilities. Wrestling with hope. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttAndy loved geology. I imagine it 
ttappealed to his meticulous nature. 
ttAn ice age here, a million years of 
ttmountain-building there, plates of 
ttbedrock grinding against each other 
ttover a span of millennia... 

<b>233tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 233

tchunk. Carefully runs his fingertip over it. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttGeology is the study of pressure

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttLike I said. In prison, a man'll do

ttoccupied. 

tHe hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. He smoothes the poster down and

tflashlight into the cell. 

<b>235tEXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1953) 235

tp37 REVERSE ANGLE (FROM INS1DE ANDY'S CELL) 237

tWe see what the guard doesn't: instead of Andy's head under 
tthe blanket, it's a wadded-up pillow. The flashlight plays 
tacross the cell, pinning Marilyn Monroe in a circle of light. 

<b>238 tANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 238

ttspent years workin' the nightshift... 

<b>239tINT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1965) 239

tBOOMING SLOWLY UP the shaft. Rats scurry the pipes. Suddenly, r
tpiece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets
tdown the shaft as the rock-hammer pushes through. The pick 
twithdraws, replaced by Andy's peering eye. 

240 tA SERIES OF DISSOLVES (1965 through 1966) 240

ttakes us through the widening of the hole. First as big as a 
ttea cup. Then a saucer. Then a dinner plate. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttProbably took him most of a year 
ttjust to get his head through. 

tAndy finally gets his head through, scraping his ears. He's 
tgot a penlight clenched in his teeth. He peers down into the 
tshaft. At the very bottom, maybe 20 feet down, a big ceramic 
tpipe runs the length of the cellblock. Beneath its coat of 
tgrime and dust, the word "SEWER" is stenciled.

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttI guess after Tommy was killed,

tAgain we see: Andy working. Norton pokes his head in. 

<b>ttttNORTON 
</b>ttLickety-split. I wanna get home. 

<b>ttttANDY 
</b>ttJust about done, sir. 

tNorton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back 
tturned. This time, though, we stay on Andy: 

tHe pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a 
tstack of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real 
tledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his 
tsweater down. He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, 
tand shoves everything in. 

<b>243tINT -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT (1966) 243

tNorton exits his office and strolls off whistling. PUSH IN on 
tthe open door. We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling 
tNorton's dress shoes from their box. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttAndy did like he was told. Buffed 
ttthose shoes to a high mirror shine. 

<b>244tINT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 244

ttNeither did I. I mean, seriously, 
tthow often do you really look at a

tTILT DOWN as he passes by. Yep, he's wearing Norton's shoes. 

<b>246tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 246

tThe lights go out. Andy places the last chess piece. Gazes up 
tat Racquel. Smiles. Pulls the rope from under his pillow. 
tHe stands and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing Norton's 
tgray pinstripe suit underneath. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the 
tcell, throwing wild shadows. 

<b>247tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 247
</b>
tThe storm rages. Andy, naked, carefully slips Norton's folded 
tsuit into a large industrial Zip-Lock bag. Next to go in are the
tshoes, chess pieces (already in a smaller bag), black ledger en
tfiles. Last but not least, a bar of soap wrapped in a towel. 

<b>248tINT -- TUNNEL -- NIGHT (1966) 248
</b>
tAndy, again wearing prison clothes, inches down the tunnel. 

<b>249tINT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1966) 249
</b>
tAndy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist,
tHe reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel 
tconduit with his fingers. 

tSuddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. Andy yanks away and 
talmost plummets head-first down the shaft. He dangles wildly 
tupside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his 
thands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. The rat 
tscurries off, pissed. 

tAndy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and
tdangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope: the
tplastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack,

tHe kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit3
this back against one wall and feet against the other, he 
tstarts down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for 
thandholds. Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying
tin the shadows. He drops the last few feet to the bottom. 

tHe approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. 
tPulls out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer. 
tRaises the rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his 
tmight. Once, twice -- third time lucky. An enormous eruption 
tof sewage cascades into the air as if rocket-propelled, the 
tMount St. Helens of shit. Andy is instantly coated black. He 
tturns away and heaves his guts out. The shit keeps coming. 

<b>250tINT -- SEWER PIPE -- NIGHT (1966) 250
</b>
tAndy peers down through the hole, playing his penlight aroun5,
tThe inside diameter is no more than two feet. Tight squeeze. 
tCoated with crud. It seems to go on for miles. 

tNo turning back. He wriggles into the pipe and starts 
tcrawling, plastic bag dragging behind. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttAndy crawled to freedom through

ttfoulness I can't even imagine. Or

tdistant. BOOM DOWN to reveal the creek...and PUSH IN toward the 
tmouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttFive hundred yards. The length of 
ttfive football fields. Just shy of 
tthalf a mile. 

tFingers appear, thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh 
tcovering the mouth of the pipe. Andy's face looms from the 
tdarkness, peering out at freedom. He wrenches the mesh loose, 
tpushes himself out, and plunges head-first into the creek. He 
tcomes up sputtering for breath. The water is waist-deep. 

tHe wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. He gets 
this shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings 
tthe shirt away. He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, 
tfeeling the rain washing him clean. Exultant. Triumphant. A 
tFLASH OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon.

tThe headline reads: "CORRUPTION AND MURDER AT SHAWSHANK." 
tBelow that, the sub-headline: "D.A. Has Ledger. Indictments

tall directions as Norton raises the gun --

<b>279tINT -- RED'S ROOM -- LATE DAY 279 
</b>
tSmall, old, dingy. An arched window with a view of Congress
tStreet. Traffic noise floats up. Red enters and pauses, 
tstaring up at the ceiling beam. Carved into the wood are the
twords: "Brooks Hatlen was here." 

<b>280tINT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY 280
</b>
tLoud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. We find Red bagging 
tgroceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. Red 
tcalls to the STORE MANAGER: 

<b>ttttRED 
</b>ttSir? Restroom break sir? 

<b>ttttMANAGER 
</b>ttt(motions him over) 
ttYou don't need to ask me every 
tttime you go take a piss. Just go. 
ttUnderstand? 

28ltINT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 281

tRed steps to the urinal, stares at himself in the wall mirror. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttThirty years I've been asking 
ttpermission to piss. I can't squeeze 
tta drop without say-so. 

tA strange east Indian guitar-whine begins. The Beatles. George 
tHarrison's "Within You Without You..." 

<b>282tEXT -- STREET -- DAY 282
</b>
t...which carries through as Red walks. People and traffic. He 
tkeeps looking at the women. An alien species. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttWomen, too, that's the other thing. 
ttI forgot they were half the human 
ttrace. There's women everywhere, 
ttevery shape and size. I find myself 
ttsemi-hard most of the time, cursing 
ttmyself for a dirty old man. 

tTWO YOUNG WOMEN stroll by in cut-offs and t-shirts. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttNot a brassiere to be seen, nipples 
ttpoking out at the world. Jeezus, 
ttpleeze-us. Back in my day, a woman 
ttout in public like that would have 
ttbeen arrested and given a sanity 
tthearing. 

<b>283tEXT -- PARK -- DUSK 283
</b>
tRed finds the park filled with HIPPIES. Hanging out. 
tHappening. Here's the source of the music: a radio. A HIPPIE 
tGIRL gyrates to the Beatles, stoned, in her own world. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttThey're calling this the Summer of 
ttLove. Summer of Loonies, you ask me. 

<b>284tINT -- PAROLE OFFICE -- DAY 284

tout his report. 

<b>ttttP.O. 
</b>ttYou staying out of the bars, Red? 

<b>ttttRED 
</b>ttYes sir. That I am.

</b>ttHow you doing otherwise? Adjusting 
ttokay? 

<b>ttttRED 
</b>ttThings got different out here.

ttfuckin' skull. 

<b>ttttRED 
</b>ttGuess the world moved on. 

<b>285tINT -- FOODWAY -- DAY 285
</b>
tBagging groceries. CHILDREN underfoot. One points a toy gun at
tRed, pumping the trigger. Red focuses on the gun, listening to
tit CLICKETY-CLACK. Sparky wheel grinding. 

tThe kids get swept off by MOM. Red starts bagging the next 
tcustomer. SLOW PUSH IN on Red. Surrounded by MOTION and NOISE.
tFeeling like the eye of a hurricane. People everywhere, 
twhipping around him like a gale. Strange. Loud. Dizzying. It
tgets distorted and weird, slow and thick, pressing in on him
tfrom all sides. The noise level intensifies. The hollering of
tchildren deepens and distends into LOW EERIE HOWLS. 

tHe's in the grip of a major anxiety attack. Tries to shake
thimself out of it. Can't. Fumbles the final items into the
tbag. Walks away. Trying not to panic. Trying not to run. 

tHe makes his way through the store. Blinking sweat. He bumps
tinto a lady's cart, mumbles an apology, keeps going. Breaks 
tinto a trot. Down the aisle, cut to the left, through the door
tinto the back rooms, faster and faster, running now, slamming
tthrough a door marked "Employees Only" into -- 

<b>286tINT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 286
</b>
t-- where he slams the door and leans heavily against it, 
tshutting everything out, breathing heavily. Alone now. 

tHe goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down. 
tHe can still hear them out there. They won't go away. He 
tglances around the restroom. Small. Not small enough. 

tHe enters a stall. Locks the door. Puts the toilet lid down 
tand sits on the john. Better. He can actually reach out and 
ttouch the walls now. They're close. Safe. Almost small enough. 
tHe draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in. 

tHe'll just sit here for a while. Until he calms down. 

<b>287tEXT -- STREET -- DUSK 287

tRed is walking home. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttThere is a harsh truth to face. 
ttNo way I'm gonna make it on the 
ttoutside. 

tHe pauses at a pawnshop window. An array of handguns. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttAll I do anymore is think of ways 
ttto break my parole. 

tThe SHOPKEEPER appears at the glass, locking the door and 
tflipping the sign: CLOSED. 

<b>288tINT -- RED'S ROOM -- NIGHT 288
</b>
tRed lies smoking in bed. Unable to sleep. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttTerrible thing, to live in fear. 
ttBrooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all 
tttoo well. All I want is to be back 
ttwhere things make sense. Where I 
ttwon't have to be afraid all the time. 

tHe glances up at the ceiling beam. "Brooks Hatlen was here." 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttOnly one thing stops me. A promise 
ttI made to Andy. 

<b>289tEXT -- COUNTRY ROAD -- MORNING 289
</b>
tA pickup truck rattles up the road trailing dust and pulls to 
ta stop. Red hops off the back, waves his thanks. The truck 

tdrives on. Red starts walking. PAN TO a roadside sign: BUXTON. 

<b>290tEXT -- MAINE COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 290
</b>
tHigh white clouds in a blazing blue sky. The trees fiery with 
tautumn color. Red walks the fields and back-roads, cheap 
tcompass in hand. Looking for a certain hayfield. 

<b>291tEXT -- COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 291
</b>
tWalking. Searching. The day turning late. Red finds himself 
tstaring at a distant field. There's a long rock wall, like 
tsomething out o f a Robert Frost poem. Big oak tree. Red checks 
this compass. North end. He crosses a dirt road into the field. 

<b>292tEXT -- HAYFIELD -- DAY 292
</b>
tRed walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree. A squirrel 
tscolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher. Red studies
tthe base of the wall. Nothing unusual here. Just a bunch of
trocks set in stone. He sighs. Fool's errand. Turns to go. 

tSomething catches his eye. He walks back, squats, peering 
tcloser. Wets a fingertip and rubs a stone. A layer of dust comes 
toff. Volcanic glass. Gleaming black. He tries to get the rock 
tout, anticipation growing. It won't come; it's too smooth. He 
tpulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free. It tumbles at his 
tfeet, leaving a ragged hole. 

tRed leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the 
tobject buried under the rock. Stunned. It's an envelope wrapped 
tin plastic. Written on it is a single word: "Red." 

tRed pulls the envelope out and rises. He just stares at it for 
ta while, almost afraid to open it. But open it he does. Inside 
tis a smaller envelope and a letter. Red begins to read: 

<b>ttttANDY (V.O.) 
</b>ttDear Red. If you're reading this, 
ttyou've gotten out. And if you've 
ttcome this far, maybe you're willing 
ttto come a little further. You 
ttremember the name of the town, 
ttdon't you? I could use a good man 
ttto help me get my project on 
ttwheels. I'll keep an eye out for 
ttyou and the chessboard ready. 
ttt(beat) 
ttRemember, Red. Hope is a good 
ttthing, maybe the best of things, 
ttand no good thing ever dies. I will 
ttbe hoping that this letter finds 
ttyou, and finds you well. Your 
ttfriend. Andy. 

tBy now, tears are spilling silently down Red's cheeks. He 
topens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty- 
tdollar bills. Twenty of them. A thousand dollars. 

<b>293tINT -- RED'S ROOM -- DAY (1967) 293
</b>
tRed is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, puts 
this hat on. His bag is by the door. He takes one last look 
taround. Only one thing left to do. He pulls a wooden chair to 
tthe center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.) 
</b>ttGet busy living or get busy dying. 
ttThat is goddamn right. 

tHe steps up on the chair. It wobbles under his weight. 

<b>294tINT -- BREWSTER -- RED'S DOOR -- DAY (1967) 294

tstairs, leaving the door open. CAMERA PUSHES through, BOOMING 
tUP to the ceiling beam which reads: "Brooks Hatlen was here." 

tA new message has been carved alongside the old: "So was Red."

tA gorgeous New England landscape whizzes by, fields and trees 
ta blur of motion. ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal a Greyhound Sceni- 
tCruiser barreling up the road, pulling abreast of us. CAMERA 
tTRAVELS from window to window, passing faces. We finally come 
tto Red gazing out at the passing landscape. 

<b>ttttRED (V.O.)

ttsit still or hold a thought in my

tA MAN is meticulously stripping the old paint and varnish by

tThe man on the boat pauses. Turns slowly around. Red arrives 
twith a smile as wide as the horizon. The other man raises his
