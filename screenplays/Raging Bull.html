<b>t
</b>tTHE TITLES appear on black. They are intercut with CLOSE-UPS
tof a fighter's body.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXAMPLES:
</b><b>t
</b>tFeet move.
<b>t
</b>tCredit over black.
<b>t
</b>tBody lunges.
<b>t
</b>tCredit over black.
<b>t
</b>tFists swing and punch at the air.
<b>t
</b>tCredit over black.
<b>t
</b>tWE CATCH A GLIMPSE of young JAKE LAMOTTA.
<b>t
</b><b>t                                   THEN CUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATRE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (1964)
</b><b>t
</b>tJAKE LAMOTTA, wearing a tux, is shadow-boxing.
<b>t
</b>tWe are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the
tshadows. At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the
tballs of his feet still pop up and down like they were on
tcanvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short
tbursts of light. He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
t     It's a thrill to be standing here
t     talking to you wonderful people. In
t     fact, it's a thrill to be standing!
t     I haven't seen so many people since
t     my last fight at Madison Square
t     Garden. After that fight, a
t     reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do
t     you go from here?' I said, 'To a
t     hospital!' I fought one hundred and
t     six professional fights and still
t     none of them bums figured out how
t     to fight me -- they kept hitting me
t     in the head! And that's why I'm
t     here tonight...
t          (starts to sing)
t     'When the fighter's not engaged in
t     his employment, his employment,
t     although he was Champ and quite the
t     rage, he must go somewhere else to
t     seek employment, seek employment.
t     But a fighter's life is not a bowl
t     of cherries, still I'd rather have
t     an egg than a fist upon my face...
t     That's Entertainment!'
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT (1941)
</b><b>t
</b>tBam! JIMMY REEVES, a fast, black middleweight, jabs LAMOTTA,
t19 years old, in the face. JAKE staggers forward. No matter
thow hard LAMOTTA is hit, no matter how often, he always
tstaggers forward -- like a bull. The bell sounds.
<b>t
</b>tBattered, JAKE slumps on the stool in his corner.
<b>t
</b>tIt's September, 1941. Europe and Asia are already at war.
tYoung SOLDIERS, freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience --
teach screaming at the FIGHTERS in the ring.
<b>t
</b>tSuddenly, words are exchanged, a GIRL screams, and a SOLDIER
tand a CIVILIAN stand and start swinging.
<b>t
</b>tAND IN THE RING: JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water and spits
tblood into the bucket his younger brother, JOEY, holds for
thim. TONY, his trainer, works the cuts.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     You didn't have to come to
t     Cleveland to get beat by a "moulan
t     yan," Jake!
<b>t
</b><b>t               TONY
</b>t     He's got you, Jake! You're
t     outpointed! You're coming up for
t     the tenth. You gotta knock him out!
<b>t
</b>tThe bell sounds for the tenth. JAKE pulls himself up and
tcharges at REEVES.
<b>t
</b>tREEVES slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points.
<b>t
</b>tIn JAKE's corner, JOEY stands and yells at JAKE:
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     A grand apiece! We got a grand
t     apiece on this, Jake! A fucking
t     grand!
<b>t
</b>tJAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate, wild
talley-fighting attack. One ferocious punch after another.
<b>t
</b>tThe SPECTATORS go wild; everyone's up for the kill.
<b>t
</b>tREEVES staggers, then falls to the canvas.
<b>t
</b>tThe REFEREE counts:
<b>t
</b><b>t               REFEREE
</b>t     One, two, three, four...
<b>t
</b>tThe GAMBLERS call out new odds; ten to one for REEVES, the
tunderdog. JOEY, excited, sees that time is running out and
tsteps in front of the bell. He swings his arms, pretending
tnot to realize he literally holds back the TIMER's arm for a
tfew seconds. This gives JAKE more time for a knockout -- but
tnot enough. JOEY is pushed back and the bell rings at the
tcount of nine, ending the match.
<b>t
</b>tBoos and cheers. The BETTORS scramble back to the BOOKIE to
tget their money.
<b>t
</b>tJAKE dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting
tthem toward the CROWD. JOEY rushes out and hugs him.
<b>t
</b>tThe ANNOUNCER steps into the ring with the mike:
<b>t
</b><b>t               ANNOUNCER
</b>t     Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner,
t     under the rules of the Cleveland
t     Boxing Commission, after ten
t     rounds, by a decision -- Jimmy
t     Reeves.
<b>t
</b>tThe ANNOUNCER holds up REEVES' arm as his corner tries to
tlift him off the canvas -- still out cold. TWO ATTENDANTS
tbring in a stretcher.
<b>t
</b>tJAKE is stunned. He still prances around, now trying to
tfigure out what happened. He raises his arms in victory, and
tthe FANS go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting
twith the COPS, throwing bottles and junk into the ring.
tPEOPLE go into the ring.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t          (to Jake)
t     Don't get out of the ring. You won
t     the fight -- let him go out first.
<b>t
</b><b>t                                   CUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b>tREEVES being placed on the stretcher.
<b>t
</b>tA ringside OFFICIAL signals the ORGANIST and she starts to
tplay the "Star Spangled Banner." REEVES is carried out.
<b>t
</b>tOnly then do JOEY and TONY escort JAKE out of the ring.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. WEBSTER AVENUE AND 169TH ST., THE BRONX - NEXT DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tIt's a rough neighborhood, inhabited primarily by welfare
tcases and street kids.
<b>t
</b>tIn the street, two young PUNKS, 13 or 14 years old, exchange
twords and start to fight. Their FRIENDS cheer them on. SALVY
tand JOEY turn the corner.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     Salvy, would I steer you wrong?
t     Let's say that's the truck; it's
t     full of cigarettes, right? Now, two
t     o'clock this morning we move the
t     truck from here to there,
t          (he points; the CAMERA
<b>t          PANS)
</b>t     take the cigarettes out, sell 'em,
t     make some cash.
<b>t
</b><b>t               SALVY
</b>t     Hey but Joey, you're thinking
t     nickels and dimes. The money's with
t     your brother.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     What do you want from my life,
t     Salvy? He's my brother.
<b>t
</b><b>t               SALVY
</b>t     He ain't doin' the right thing.
t     He's makin' beans compared to what
t     he should be makin'. Can't you make
t     him understand that?
<b>t
</b>tA COP goes over and starts to break up the fight.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t          (to cop)
t     Hey, leave the kids alone.
<b>t
</b><b>t               SALVY
</b>t     Get lost.
t          (joking, he knows the Cop)
t     Hey kids, "A cop is a rat."
t     Remember that, "A rat."
<b>t
</b>tThe KIDS yell.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t          (to Cop)
t     Hey Jimmy, here's a dollar for your
t     trouble. There's some bums around
t     the corner -- they need your help.
<b>t
</b><b>t               COP
</b>t     Keep the dollar, Joey. Get yourself
t     a new suit.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t          (laughs)
t     Here's my new suit.
t          (grabs his crotch)
t     Right here.
<b>t
</b><b>t               COP
</b>t     Hey, don't get wise!
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     Just kidding, take it easy.
t          (to himself)
t     No fuckin' sense of humor.
<b>t
</b>tSALVY and JOEY continue to walk a little faster, giggling.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tJAKE, bandaged from the REEVES fight the night before, sits
tat the kitchen table (he's had a few glasses of wine) while
this wife, IRMA, 19, cooks at the stove.
<b>t
</b>tJAKE gets up and pokes at the frying steak with a fork.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     This looks done.
<b>t
</b><b>t               IRMA
</b>t     It's not done.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     It looks done. I'll take it the way
t     it is.
<b>t
</b><b>t               IRMA
</b>t     Here's your steak. You can't wait
t     for it to be done. Here.
<b>t
</b>tShe slams the steak onto his plate, and reaches back to the
tstove.
<b>t
</b><b>t               IRMA (CONT'D)
</b>t     Here's your carrots. You're in such
t     a hurry. You can't wait.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     No, I can't wait. You know when I
t     wait? When it's important to wait.
t     It's not important to wait for no
t     steak. It's important to wait for
t     Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't
t     important to wait for no steak! I
t     won that fight. So, I stayed in the
t     ring, and that way I made sure
t     everybody knew it. I shoulda
t     knocked him out earlier,
t     sonofabitch.
<b>t
</b>tHe starts to eat the steak. He takes a drink of wine.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>t     Wait! I'll wait. But let me tell
t     you, if this steak was the
t     middleweight championship, I'd show
t     you how I'd wait. I'd eat it raw.
t     I'd drink the blood. I'd eat it
t     before it came out of the cow --
t     that's how I'd wait.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING/TENEMENT - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tSALVY and JOEY approach the building.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     I can't convince him. He's got such
t     a thick head, I'd like to crack it
t     open myself. Believe me, my own
t     brother. It's very hard. You don't
t     have to convince me -- I know we
t     should be with Tommy. You talk to
t     him. He don't listen to nobody.
<b>t
</b><b>t               SALVY
</b>t     Look, I'm just tellin' you how
t     Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard
t     on himself. Tommy wants him with
t     us. It's as simple as that.
<b>t
</b>tThey stop at the doorway.
<b>t
</b><b>t               SALVY (CONT'D)
</b>t     Talk some sense into him, will ya?
t     You're still his brother.
t     If he ain't gonna listen to you, he
t     ain't gonna listen to nobody!
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     All right, I'll try. See you later.
<b>t
</b><b>t               SALVY
</b>t     Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     Right, the gym.
<b>t
</b>tSALVY leaves. JOEY goes into the building.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tJOEY is knocking at the door. IRMA opens it.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t          (noticing Jake)
t     What's the matter?
<b>t
</b><b>t               IRMA
</b>t     He's doing it again.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t          (goes to Jake)
t     What's the matter? You're drinking.
t     You're eating like an animal.
<b>t
</b>tJOEY sits next to JAKE at the kitchen table. JAKE has a drink
tin his hand, and tears on his face.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY (CONT'D)
</b>t     What's wrong?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t          (gets up)
t     Nothing...
<b>t
</b>tJAKE goes into the living room. IRMA looks at JOEY. JOEY
tfollows JAKE.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. LIVING ROOM
</b><b>t
</b>tJOEY walks up to JAKE.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t          (privately, to Joey)
t     I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis,
t     that's what's the matter.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     What're you talking about? He's a
t     heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
<b>t
</b>tJAKE holds out his scarred hands.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     Look at these hands. These fuckin'
t     hands. I was born with a girl's
t     hands. And even if I put on enough
t     weight to be a heavyweight, I'd be
t     too slow to fight. No matter how
t     big I get, I'll never be big enough
t     to fight Louis.
<b>t
</b>tJAKE pauses. IRMA watches from the doorway.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     That's what I'm sayin'. You
t     shouldn't even think like that.
t     It's crazy.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll
t     never be big enough to fight Louis,
t     but I know Joey, I know...
<b>t

</b>t     Sure. What is it?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     Hit me in the face.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t          (after a pause)
t     You want me to do what?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     You heard me, I said hit me.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your
t     best shot. On the jaw.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     Jack, I got no gloves.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t          (grabs a nearby towel)
t     Here's your glove.
<b>t
</b>tJOEY wraps it around his fist. IRMA watches. JOEY hits JAKE

<b>t

<b>t
</b>tJOEY hits him again.
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. GLEASON'S GYM - NEXT DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tGleason's, a small gym and fight club, stands on 149th Street
tand 3rd Avenue above a small sandwich shop.
<b>t
</b>tEach day BOBBY GLEASON posts a small sign alongside the door
tlisting the fighters who will be working out. JAKE's name is
tposted at the top; the other names are unmemorable.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. GLEASON'S - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tGleason's has a single sparring ring and ten training bags.
tAbout a dozen managers train their fighters out at Gleason's.
tFor 50 cents, spectators sit in the gallery and watch the
tworkouts.
<b>t
</b>tJAKE is sparring with JOEY in the ring. They've been working
tout for a while now. The bell rings ending the third round.
tJAKE prances about the ring waiting for the bell to sound
tagain.
<b>t
</b>tAt that moment, SALVY, along with two other young "BUTTON"
tMEN (actually, they are very young -- about JOEY's age) enter
tthe gym. They are well-dressed (over-coat, ties, suits,
tflashy rings, etc.). They say hello to some PEOPLE by the
tdoor. JAKE looks over and notices them. SALVY looks over to
tthe ring.
<b>t
</b><b>t               SALVY
</b>t          (waves)
t     Hey Joey --

</b><b>t               SALVY (CONT'D)
</b>t          (waves again)
t     Jake, how you doin'?
<b>t
</b>tJAKE nods to SALVY very cold. SALVY notices and can feel that
the's not exactly wanted there by JAKE. JOEY notices the same
tand becomes a bit nervous.
<b>t
</b>tSALVY sits down near the ring but not as close as he'd like
tto. His two friends, FRANKIE and GUIDO, sit nearby also.
<b>t
</b>tJAKE goes to JOEY's corner.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     Did you know they were coming up
t     here?
<b>t
</b>tJOEY doesn't answer.

</b><b>t               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>t     Answer me when I talk to you.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY
</b>t     Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to

<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t          (interrupting)
t     Don't ever bring those kids up here
t     again! I'm working out, I'm killin'
t     myself in here, and they walk
t     around like they fuckin' own the
t     neighborhood.
<b>t
</b>tSALVY and the OTHERS see JOEY being chewed out by JAKE. They
tbegin to feel unwelcome at the gym.
<b>t
</b>tThe bell sounds. JAKE is more aggressive now as he corners
tJOEY. JAKE swings away with body punches. JOEY can't block
tthem. SALVY and the OTHERS watch.
<b>t
</b>tThe bell sounds again. With that, SALVY and the OTHERS start
tto leave.
<b>t
</b><b>t               SALVY
</b>t          (to Joey)
t     Hey Joey, we better go. See you

<b>t
</b>tJOEY, dazed, turns to wave.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t     Go 'head. Wave goodbye. They're
t     your friends.
<b>t
</b>tJAKE watches them leave.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>t     And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he
t     think he is? I'm gonna let that
t     fuckin' hard-on come up here and
t     act like a big shot.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JOEY

</b><b>t               JAKE
</b>t          (interrupting)
t     Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como.
t     I don't care about Jesus Christ on

tWE SEE highlights of the fight: JAKE is fighting ferociously,

tgives a blow by blow description. JAKE takes a lot of
tpunishment from SUGAR RAY -- until the 8th round. Then, JAKE
tnails SUGAR RAY with a savage left. JAKE chases SUGAR RAY and
tpounds him with a left and a right. SUGAR RAY gets in a right
tcross. They stand toe to toe, fighting. Then, JAKE lands a
tleft to SUGAR RAY's stomach, and knocks him through the
tropes. JAKE goes after SUGAR RAY, but the REFEREE stops him.
tSUGAR RAY gets back into the ring and sinks to one knee,

</b><b>t
</b>tThe small BAND plays a routine fanfare as JAKE steps onto the
tplatform. He takes the mike with one hand and silences the
tBAND with the other. The applause dies out as he speaks:
<b>t
</b><b>t                JAKE
</b>t      Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
t      It's a thrill to be standin' here
t      talking to you wonderful people. In
t      fact, it's a thrill to be standin'.
t      I haven't seen so many people since
t      my last fight at Madison Square
t      Garden. After that fight a reporter
t      asked me, "Jake, where do you go
t      from here?" I said, "To a
t      hospital."
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>t      I fought one hundred and six
t      professional fights and none of
t      them bums figured out how to fight
t      me -- they kept hitting me in the
t      head!
t           (calls to the bar)
t      Will somebody at the bar -- Linda? 
t      - get me a drink. I figure if I'm
t      gonna work to drunks I might as
t      well be one of 'em! I like this
t      place. It's a family type club...
t      every night I see a lot of fathers
t      sitting out there with their young
t      daughters! That's nice.
<b>t
</b>tLINDA hands him a drink.
<b>t
</b><b>t                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>t      Thanks, honey. -- She's terrific.
t      The kinda girl you wanta take home
t      to meet your father. Especially if
t      your old man's a degenerate! --
t      Here's a toast! "To your health!
t      You only live once. But if you play
t      it right, once is enough." I
t      shouldn't be drinkin' like this
t      'cause I'm tryin' to lose weight.
t      I'm on this terrific diet -- I'm
t      allowed to eat anything I want. As
t      long as I don't swallow it! Well, I
t      never had much luck with my weight.
t      In fact, -- I never had much luck
t      with anything -- until about a few
t      years ago, when this happened --
<b>t
</b>tHe indicates the blow-up behind him and waits for applause,
tof which there is some.
<b>t
</b><b>t                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>t      ... thanks, I'm glad to see you
t      remember. For those of you that
t      don't... that's me takin' the title
t      from Cerdan.
t      You know, the tough thing about
t      winnin' the title... the next thing
t      you gotta do is have a rematch...
t      just to show it wasn't no fluke. So
t      what happens? Marcel Cerdan, a
t      really great champ, after I beat
t      him... he gets himself killed in
t      that airplane crash... a pretty
t      rotten break for him. That's why I
t      don't like to fly. People say to
t      me, "Look, Jake, when your time is
t      up, your time is up." And I say,
t      "Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane
t      and the pilot's time is up?" As
t      good as Cerdan was, I could've
t      taken him again. But I never got
t      the chance to prove it wasn't no
t      fluke. He got killed but he got to
t      be what they call a legend. I don't
t      know what's worse -- bein' a fluke
t      or bein' a legend. -- That's the
t      kinda luck I got. That's why I quit
t      the ring and moved down here from
t      New York. My wife said, "You gotta
t      get outa this town, Jake." Come to
t      think of it... the boxing
t      commission said the same thing! But
t      I don't miss New York. Give me
t      Miami any day.
<b>t
</b>tThe AUDIENCE applauds.
<b>t
</b><b>t                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>t      Miami's a great place. I get along
t      with everybody in this town... even
t      the police force... They got the
t      best cops here money can buy! --
t      Only kiddin'. By the way... me and
t      my wife Vickie's gettin' ready to
t      celibrate our eleventh wedding
t      anniversary.
<b>t
</b>tMore applause.
<b>t
</b><b>t                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>t      We get along real great. We fight a
t      little but I never really belted
t      her on purpose. Once  in a while
t      I'm standin' there doin' little
t      shadow-boxin' and she happens to
t      walk right into the shadow... I
t      can't help that.
t      She says, "Whataya hittin' me for?"
t      I says, "It's nothin'. It's only a
t      love tap." She says, "It's a good
t      thing you're not crazy about me!" --
t      I am crazy about her. I heard her
t      talkin' to a friend on the phone
t      and she was sayin', "After eleven
t      years, I'm still in love with the
t      same guy." -- If I ever find out
t      who the bum is, I'll kill him!
t      Women. You can't live with 'em, you
t      can't live without 'em.

</b>t      Is whispering nothing? Is leaning
t      cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?
t      Kissing with inside lip? Stopping
t      the career of laughter with a sign?
t      -- A note infallible of breaking
t      honesty -- horsing foot on foot?
t      Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks
t      more swift? Hours, minutes? Noon,
t      midnight? and all eyes blind with
t      the pin and web but theirs, theirs
t      only, that would unseen be wicked?
t      Is this nothing? Why, then the
t      world and all that's in't is
t      nothing; The covering sky is
t      nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife
t      is nothing; nor nothing have these
t      nothings, if this be nothing." --
t      That's from something called "The
t      Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You
t      all remember Shakespeare.
t      He wrote all them famous plays one
t      after the other, then he went into
t      a big slump and he ain't done
t      anything good in years. That speech
t      is about jealousy -- jealousy's a
t      bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot
t      of guys... take me... I almost
t      killed my brother... I love him...
t      he's my family... I mean, there's
t      nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And
t      that's the way we been goin' thru
t      life -- doin' nothin' for each
t      other! Anytime he got in trouble
t      when we was kids, I got him out of
t      it. You know, he used to steal
t      little things when we was growin'
t      up. But he was particular... only
t      stole things that begin with an 'a'
t      -- a watch, a car, a suit, a
t      ring... But I was wrong... I
t      shoulda never hit my brother.
t      Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every
t      time I need somethin' I gotta go
t      shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist
t      once told me, "When you hit your
t      brother you're really hittin' your
t      mother, but you can't admit it to
t      yourself." He's really crazy. I
t      woulda never hit my mother. I mean,
t      only in self-defense!

</b>t      So there I am in the can... and not
t      the one that says "gentlemen" on
t      the door. I'm talkin' about jail!
t      Down south!
t      I mean, jail up north is gotta be
t      like summer camp compared to jail
t      down in cracker country. And if
t      you're a guy like me, you ain't got
t      a chance in a place like that.
t      Especially if you're Italian... you
t      come from the Bronx... and you're
t      an ex-champ. As soon as they saw
t      me... soon as they heard me... I
t      know I'm in trouble. To me, they
t      got an accent, and to them, I got
t      an accent! You gotta get the
t      picture -- I'm big, I got small
t      hands, I walk like I'm still in the
t      ring... the balls of my feet pop up
t      and down, you know... and whenever
t      I get the chance, I read a lot. So
t      naturally, takin' all this into
t                                      co
t      sideration, they figure it adds up
t      to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I
t      didn't mind too much when they
t      called me "Queer" or "Mr. Tough
t      Guy" or "Yankee Punk"... But one
t      day these screws got to me... I was
t      workin' on the work gang, pickin'
t      up some trees that were knocked
t      down by a storm or somethin' and
t      puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a
t      sudden... one of the trees slipped
t      and fell on me and pinned me to the
t      ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree
t      across my chest! This screw walks
t      over, takin' his time, he looks
t      down at me and says, "Well, Champ
t      Pimp... you lyin' down on the job
t      again?"! They got a great sense of
t      humor when they're standin' there
t      with a gun in their arms and you
t      got a tree on your chest! So I look
t      up at him and say, "Oh, this
t      tree... it fell on me." And he
t      says, "Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have
t      known, I would've yelled 'timber'"
t      I said, "Hey, look... it hurts. I
t      think maybe I broke somethin'!" He
t      says, "Well, whaddaya know... Champ
t      PImp's got himself a boo-boo." Then
t      I got as stupid as him. I said, "If
t      I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin'
t      me the money you made last night?"!
t      Then another screw comes over and
t      says, "This Yankee creep givin' you
t      trouble?" -- What kind of trouble?
t      What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with
t      the tree? Now anybody else in their
t      right mind would've said, "No sir,
t      I wouldn't think of giving any of
t      you gentlemen trouble... I just
t      want to serve my time and get the
t      hell out of here as soon as I can."
t      That's anybody else. When I said
t      it... it was a little different.
t      "You stupid cracker... take your
t      hands off me or I'll get up and
t      kick your brains out -- but first
t      you gotta bend over so I can find
t      'em!" Next thing I know I'm in the
t      hole. Solitary confinement. All my
t      life I had guys in my corner
t      yellin' "Go get 'em, jake... kill
t      'em! You're the greatest." Now
t      there's nobody rootin' for me. But
t      it wasn't so bad. I learned things
t      there. I learned how to scratch a
t      calendar on the wall. I never knew
t      how to do that before. Now I know.
t      Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is
t      two scratches. Wednesday is three
t      scratches. And so on. Except for
t      Sundays. Sundays is no scratches.

tcontinues his monologue.
<b>t

</b>t      Except here, gentlemen, with you
t      bums. I call you "gentlemen"... but

t      exclusive... now they got bouncers
t      outside to throw the drunks in! My
t      first night here I said to the
t      boss, "Where's the toilet?" -- He
t      said, "You're in it!" By the way,
t      this engagement is just a stepping
t      stone for me. If I do good here,

<b>t
</b>tThe CROWD starts to shout: "Get the fuck off the stage!"

t      for you guys... we had a 50-cent
t      minimum charge just to keep out the

<b>t

this feet. The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break
topen and splatter JOEY's pants legs.
<b>t
</b>tJOEY stares down at his pants, then up at JAKE. Suddenly, he
tbelts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw. JAKE is taken
tby surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up.

<b>t
</b><b>t                JAKE
</b>t      You know, I'm not a philosopher or
t      anything like that but I been
t      around a little and the way I look
t      at it is -- We're, all of us,
t      lookin' for the same thing: a shot
t      at the title. No matter what you
t      wanta be... you wanta shot at bein'
t      the best. Well, I had mine and
t      it'll always be in the record
t      books... it don't make no
t      difference what happens to me from
t      here on in -- I got my shot and
t      that's a fact. Some guys weren't
t      that lucky... like the one Marlon
t      Brando played in "On the
t      Waterfront" -- an up and comer
t      who's now a down and outer. You
t      remember... there was this scene in
t      the back of the car with his
t      brother Charlie, a small-time
t      racket guy, and it went somethin'
t      like this -- "It wasn't him,
t      Charlie. It was you. You 'member
t      that night in the Garden you came
t      down my dressing room and said.
t      'Kid, this ain't your night.
t      We're going for the price on
t      Wilson.' You 'member that? 'This
t      ain't your night!' My night -- I
t      coulda taken Wilson apart! So what
t      happens? He gets the title shot
t      outdoors on the ballpark, and what
t      do I get? A one-way ticket to
t      Palookaville. I never was no good
t      after that night. It was like a
t      peak you reach. Then it went
t      downhill. It was you, Charlie. You
t      was my brother, Charlie. You
t      shoulda looked out for me a little
t      bit. You shoulda taken care of me
t      just a little bit so I wouldn't
t      have to take them dives for the
t      short end money... You don't
t      understand! I coulda had class. I
t      coulda been a contender. I coulda
t      been somebody -- instead of a bum,
t      which is what I am. Let's face it.
t      It was you, Charlie."
