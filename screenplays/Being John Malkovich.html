<b>tINT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The 
twall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
ta collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
tbook. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
t"Sit." Craig opens the book. It reads: "sit sit sit sit
tsit..." over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
tbook. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
tHe looks at the book again. It is now entitled "Die."  He
topens it up.  "die die die die die..."  A rooster crows.

tCraig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
tcrowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for 
twork, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.


<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin
tt    Hatch was out of his pen. Good
tt    morning.


tLotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead.

</b>tt    Morning.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms
tt    coming in first thing.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    Enjoy.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    Craig, listen, honey, I've been
tt    thinking... maybe you'd feel better
tt    if you got, you know, a job or
tt    something.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    We've been over this. Nobody's
tt    looking for a puppeteer in today's
tt    wintry economic climate.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    Well, you know, maybe something else
tt    until this whole puppet thing turns
tt    around.

<b>tttt CRAIG

tt    The Great Mantini doesn't need a day
tt    job.

tt    Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.
ttt    (beat)
tt    Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me
tt    a favor?

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    What?

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    Would you check in on Elijah? He seems
tt    to be a little under the weather this
tt    morning.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    Which one is Elijah again?

<b>tttt CRAIG

<b>tINT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING
</b>
tThe place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers.
tA small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage.
tThe stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet 
tversion of Craig. The "Craig" puppet paces back and forth, 
twringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,
tabove and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.
tHis fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into
ta dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the
tpuppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one
twould think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on
tthe real Craigx92s brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
tpuppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
tbrow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
tdevice that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
tcollapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to
tits face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down
taround the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches
toff the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.

tThe room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all
tkinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits
ton the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the 
tbackground. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding
this stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is
tworking a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower.
tThe assembled crowd is enthralled.


<b>tttt TV ANNOUNCER
</b>tt    The crowd is enthralled as Derek

tCraig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a

</b>tt    What's he been in?

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    Lots of things. He's very well

tt    is a very odd thing, supernatural,
tt    for lack of a better word. It raises
tt    all sorts of philosophical questions
tt    about the nature of self, about the
tt    existence of the soul. Am I me? Is
tt    Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha
tt    right, is duality an illusion? Do
tt    you see what a can of worms this

</b>tt    I just wanted to tell you that. And

tt    they remain vital, in touch with
tt    themselves, and when they lie on

tMaxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the

tt    peering out. Behind the stubble and

tt    baby was born into this sad world.

tWe see a shot of a newborn.

<b>tttt LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
</b>tt    His name is John Horatio Hannibal
tt    Malkovich. And we are the keepers
tt    of the door to his soul. One day,
tt    when his brain is big enough, we
tt    will all journey into his head and
tt    live there for all eternity. Following
tt    the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,
tt    we will build the ultimate communist
tt    community, one body and hundreds,
tt    maybe thousands, of brains inside
tt    working together to form a super
tt    human intellect capable of curing
tt    disease, stopping all war, and
tt    ruling the world with a benevolent
tt    fist. We will take a wife, a woman
tt    of uncommon beauty and intellect, who
tt    is, as yet, still an infant herself.

tWe see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in
ther hair.

<b>tttt LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
</b>tt    Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella
tt    DeMent.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    Does Floris know that she's the

<b>tttt LESTER
</b>tt    Well, I tried to explain it to her,

tMalkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite
trelaxed.

<b>tttt MAXINE
</b>tt    You still there, sweets?

<b>tttt MALKOVICH
</b>tt    Yeah. I've figured out how to hold
tt    on as long as I want. Oddly enough,
tt    it's all in the wrists.

<b>tttt MAXINE
</b>tt    Wow.
ttt    (little girl pout)
tt    Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.

<b>tttt MALKOVICH
</b>tt    You mean with Malkovich?

<b>tttt MAXINE
</b>tt    I'd love to see your work.

<b>tttt MALKOVICH
</b>ttt    (pleased)
tt    Really? Yeah. Okay.

tMalkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.

<b>tttt MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
</b>tt    I'll do something I call "Craig's
tt    Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."

tMalkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper
tdid at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same,
tcomplete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow.
tHe finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.

<b>tttt MAXINE
</b>ttt    (moved)
tt    That was incredible. You're brilliant!

<b>tttt MALKOVICH
</b>tt    You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing
tt    with dolls.

<b>tttt MAXINE
</b>tt    You're right, my darling, it's
tt    so much more. It's playing with
tt    people!

tMalkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.

<b>tttt MAXINE
</b>tt    Stay in him forever?

<b>tttt MALKOVICH
</b>ttt    (as Malkovich, screaming)
tt    No!
ttt    (as Craig, calmly)
tt    But how will we make a living,
tt    my love, if our clientele doesn't
tt    have access to our product?

<b>tttt MAXINE
</b>tt    Well, we'll have all the money in
tt    Malkovich's bank account, plus he
tt    still gets acting work occasionally.

<b>tttt MALKOVICH
</b>ttt    (as Malkovich, breaking through)
tt    No! Please!
ttt    (as Craig, to Malkovich)
tt    Shut up, will you? We're trying to
tt    think here.
ttt    (to Maxine)
tt    It is sort of like being a puppeteer.
tt    I like that about it.

<b>tttt MAXINE
</b>tt    No one would ever have to know its
tt    not him.

<b>tttt MALKOVICH
</b>ttt    (an idea)
tt    Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
tt    What if we presented Malkovich as the
tt    world's most complicated puppet and
tt    me as the only puppeteer sophisticated
tt    enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor

tjust as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.

</b>ttt    (Craig to Malkovich)

</b>ttt    (kissing him)
tt    It's okay, my sweet.

tThey go back to filling the portal. There is the sound
tof many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies
topen and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst
tin. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.

<b>tttt LESTER
</b>tt    Aaaahhhh, the portal!

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>ttt    (to Malkovich)
tt    You bastard!

tLotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds

<b>tttt LESTER
</b>tt    No! Don't harm the vessel!

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    It's Craig in there, I can tell.

<b>tttt LESTER
</b>tt    I understand, but we must protect

ttt    (to Malkovich)
tt    Please, Craig, please step aside
tt    and allow us to have what is
tt    rightfully ours.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    Squatter's rights, Lester.

tCraig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm
tthrough Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances
ttriumphantly over at Lotte.

<b>tttt MAXINE
</b>tt    Now excuse us, we have an
tt    entertainment legend to create.

<b>tttt LESTER
</b>ttt    (to the cult members)

texit.

<b>tttt LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>tt    Now, let's see what we can do to
tt    salvage this portal... for the sake

tThe Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and
tbegin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement.
tFingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and

tMalkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one

tThe usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.
tMartini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now
tperforming the "back of the car scene" from "On The
tWaterfront."  He alternates between the Marlon Brando part
tand the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one
tstool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see
tLester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.

<b>tttt LESTER

tMantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a 
tbeautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the
texit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some
tconcern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and
tsmiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On
tstage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and
tjuggling chainsaws.

<b>tttt MANTINI
</b>tt    Broadway's finest three hours. It's

tLotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb
ton her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then
tembrace.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>ttt    (to the animals)
tt    I'll be with you always, my friends.
tt    Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll
tt    rejoin you with wings and a beak.

<b>tttt ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
</b>tt    Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings
tt    and a halo.

tLotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends
tinto a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.

<b>tttt PARROT
</b>ttt    (softly)
tt    Good-bye. Good-bye.

<b>tttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MERTIN-FLEMMER BUILDING - DAY
</b>
tA man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast
tis clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of
tthe others, and enters the building.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
tLotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses
tthe emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt.
tShe picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the
tdoor. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes
tand wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tLotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It
tis nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She
tturns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    My God!

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    I'm so glad you're safe. You look
tt    really wonderful.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    I'm in love. For the first time.
tt    It's funny, but when it happens to
tt    you, there's no question.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    He's a lucky man.
ttt    (beat)
tt    Do I know him?

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    It's Elijah.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    The iguana?

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    The monkey.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    Oh, right. As long as you're happy.
tt    I'm sure he's a better lover than I
tt    ever was.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    A better friend.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>ttt    (beat)
tt    I'm sorry for everything.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>ttt    (pecking him on the cheek)
tt    It's okay, Craig. It all worked out,
tt    in an odd sort of way.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    You came up here looking for the
tt    portal?

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    Yeah. I was going to kill him from
tt    the inside.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    And yourself too in the process. God,
tt    you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I
tt    see that before?

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    You saw it once. Now you see it again.
tt    That's life, isn't it? And you were
tt    up here to try the same thing, weren't
tt    you?

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    I suppose. But they got here first,
tt    the lousy bastards. So now it's all
tt    over, I guess.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    I don't know. There's a small
tt    community of us. We have a place they
tt    don't know about. We're happy. We'll
tt    keep trying to figure out a way. Come
tt    stay with us. Join the struggle.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    You'll have me, after all I've done
tt    to you?

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    People make mistakes.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    I'm through with puppets, Lotte.
tt    I just want you to know that.

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    I know.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    I'd like to be a farmer. I want to
tt    help things grow, to encourage life.
tt    Do you and your friends need a farmer?

<b>tttt LOTTE
</b>tt    Sure. We could really use a farmer.
tt    We'd be grateful for the help.
ttt    (beat)
tt    Also, I think, you know, if you
tt    wouldn't mind too terribly, a little
tt    puppet show every once in a while,
tt    would do a lot to lift our spirits.
tt    You know, if you wouldn't mind too
tt    terribly.

tCraig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.

<b>tttt LOTTE (CONT'D)
</b>tt    Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.

tShe puts her arm around him and leads him toward the
televator.

<b>tttt CRAIG
</b>tt    I love you, Lotte.

tWe come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put
tit around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.
tWe follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a
tmarionette being controlled from above by an emotionless
tMantini in a gray jumpsuit.

<b>tttt MANTINI
</b>ttt    (in Craig's voice)
tt    I can't wait to see where you and your
tt    friends live, Lotte.

<b>tttt LOTTE (O.S.)
</b>tt    It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.

tNow we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w
tfollow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.

<b>tttt FLEMMER
</b>tt    One serpent, coming up.

tFlemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves
tinto his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,
tlooks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal
ttunnel.

tMUSIC IN: "Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head" by They
tMight Be Giants. It plays throughout the credits.
