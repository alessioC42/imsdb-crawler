Abrupt medium close-up of Alvy Singer doing a comedy monologue.  He
wearing a crumbled sports jacket and tieless shirt; the background is stark.

<b>ttttALVY         
</b>ttThere's an old joke.  Uh, two elderly 
ttwomen are at a Catskills mountain 
ttresort, and one of 'em says: "Boy, the 
ttfood at this place is really terrible." 
ttThe other one says, "Yeah, I know, and 
ttsuch ... small portions." Well, that's 
ttessentially how I feel about life.  Full 
ttof loneliness and misery and suffering 
ttand unhappiness, and it's all over much 
tttoo quickly.  The-the other important 
ttjoke for me is one that's, uh, usually 
ttattributed to Groucho Marx, but I think 
ttit appears originally in Freud's wit and 
ttits relation to the unconscious.  And it 
ttgoes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ... 
tt"I would never wanna belong to any club 
ttthat would have someone like me for a 
ttmember." That's the key joke of my adult 
ttlife in terms of my relationships with 
ttwomen.  Tsch, you know, lately the 
ttstrangest things have been going 
ttthrough my mind, 'cause I turned forty, 
tttsch, and I guess I'm going through a 
ttlife crisis or something, I don't know. 
ttI, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.  
ttI'm not one o' those characters, you know. 
ttAlthough I'm balding slightly on top, that's 
ttabout the worst you can say about me.  I, 
ttuh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get 
ttolder, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the-
ttthe balding virile type, you know, as 
ttopposed to say the, uh, distinguished 
ttgray, for instance, you know?  'Less I'm 
ttneither o' those two. Unless I'm one o' 
ttthose guys with saliva dribbling out of 
tthis mouth who wanders into a cafeteria 
ttwith a shopping bag screaming about 
ttsocialism. 
ttt(Sighing) 
ttAnnie and I broke up and I-I still can't 
ttget my mind around that.  You know, I-I 
ttkeep sifting the pieces of the relationship 
ttthrough my mind and-and examining my life 
ttand tryin' to figure out where did the 
ttscrew-up come, you know, and a year ago we 
ttwere... tsch, in love.  You know, and-and-and 
tt... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a 
ttmorose type.  I'm not a depressive character.  
ttI-I-I, uh, 
ttt(Laughing) 
ttyou know, I was a reasonably happy kid, 
ttI guess.  I was brought up in Brooklyn 
ttduring World War II.

<b>INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE-DAY
</b>
Alvy as young boy sits on a sofa with his  mother in an old-fashioned, 
cluttered doctor's office.  The doctor stands near the sofa, holding a 
cigarette and listening.

<b>ttttMOTHER 
</b>ttt(To the doctor) 
ttHe's been depressed.  All off a sudden, 
tthe can't do anything.

<b>ttttDOCTOR 
</b>ttt(Nodding) 
ttWhy are you depressed, Alvy?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMOTHER 
</b>ttt(Nudging Alvy) 
ttTell Dr. Flicker. 
ttt(Young Alvy sits, his head down.  His 
tttmother answers for him) 
ttIt's something he read.

<b>ttttDOCTOR 
</b>ttt(Puffing on his cigarette and 
tttnodding) 
ttSomething he read, huh?  

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(His head still down) 
ttThe universe is expanding.

<b>ttttDOCTOR 
</b>ttThe universe is expanding?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Looking up at the doctor) 
ttWell, the universe is everything, and if 
ttit's expanding, someday it will break apart 
ttand that would be the end of everything!

Disgusted, his mother looks at him.

<b>ttttMOTHER 
</b>ttt(shouting) 
ttWhat is that your business? 
ttt(she turns back to the doctor) 
ttHe stopped doing his homework.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWhat's the point?

<b>ttttMOTHER 
</b>ttt(Excited, gesturing with her hands) 
ttWhat has the universe got to do with it?  
ttYou're here in Brooklyn!  Brooklyn is not 
ttexpanding!

<b>ttttDOCTOR 
</b>ttt(Heartily, looking down at Alvy) 
ttIt won't be expanding for billions of years 
ttyet, Alvy.  And we've gotta try to enjoy 
ttourselves while we're here.  Uh?

He laughs.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
Fall shot of house with an amusement-park roller-coaster ride built over it. 
A line of cars move up and then slides with great speed while out the window 
of the house a band shakes a dust mop.

ttmemories, but I swear I was brought up

</b>
<b>INT. HOUSE
</b>
Alvy as a child sits at the table eating soup and reading a comic book while 
his father sits on the sofa reading the paper.  The house shakes with every 
move of the roller coaster.

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE 
</b>tt-coaster in the Coney Island section of 
ttBrooklyn.  Maybe that accounts for my 
ttpersonality, which is a little nervous, I 
ttthink.

<b>CUT TO:
</b>
Young Alvy at the food-stand concession watching three military men 
representing the Army, the Navy and the Marines arm in arm with a blond woman 
in a skirted bathing suit.  They all turn and run toward the foreground.  The 
girl stops before the camera to lean over and throw a kiss.  The sign over the 
concession reads "Steve's Famous Clam Bar.  Ice Cold Beer, "and the roller 
coaster is moving in full gear in the background.

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE 
</b>ttYou know, I have a hyperactive imagination.  
ttMy mind tends to jump around a little, and 
tthave some trouble between fantasy and reality.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
Full shot of people in bumper cars thoroughly enjoying bumping into each other 
as Alvy father stands in the center of the track directing traffic.

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE 
</b>ttMy father ran the bumper-car concession. 
ttt(Alvy as a child moves into the frame 
tttdriving a bumper car.  He stops as other 
tttcars bombard him.  His father continues 
tttto direct the traffic) 
ttThere-there he is and there I am.  But I-I-I-I 
ttused to get my aggression out through those 
ttcars all the time.

Alvy backs up his car off screen.

<b>INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY
</b>
The camera pans over three austere-looking teachers standing in front of the 
blackboard.  The chalk writing on the board changes as each teacher lectures. 
While Alvy speaks, one of the male teachers puts an equation on the blackboard.
- "2 X 10 = 20 " and other arithmetic formulas.

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE 
</b>ttI remember the staff at our public 
ttschool.  You know, we had a saying, uh, 
ttthat "Those who can't do, teach, and 
ttthose who can't teach, teach gym." And 
tt...uh, h'h, of course, those who couldn't 
ttdo anything, I think, were assigned to 
ttour school.  I must say-

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
A female teacher standing in front of an old-fashioned schoolroom.  The 
blackboard behind her reads "Transportation Administration. The camera pans 
her point of view: a group of young students sitting behind their desks.  Alvy 
as a child sits in a center desk wile all around him there is student activity;
there is note-passing, ruler-tapping, nose-picking, gumchewing.

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE 
</b>ttI always felt my schoolmates were idiots.  
ttMelvyn Greenglass, you know, fat little 
ttface, and Henrietta Farrell, just Miss 
ttPerfect all the time.  And-and Ivan 
ttAckerman, always the wrong answer.  Always. 

Ivan stands up behind his desk.

<b>ttttIVAN 
</b>ttSeven and three is nine.

Alvy hits his forehead with his hand.  Another student glances over at him, 
reacting.

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE 
</b>ttEven then I knew they were just jerks. 
ttt(The camera moves back to the teacher, 
tttwho is glaring out at her students) 
ttIn nineteen forty-two I had already dis-

As Alvy talks, the camera shows him move from his seat and kiss a young girl.  
She jumps from her seat in disgust, rubbing her cheek, as Alvy moves back to 
his seat.

<b>tttt1ST GIRL 
</b>ttt(Making noises) 
ttUgh, he kissed me, he kissed me.

<b>ttttTEACHER 
</b>ttt(Off screen) 
ttThat's the second time this month!  Step 
ttup here!

As the teacher, really glaring now, speaks, Alvy rises from his seat and moves 
over to her.  Angry, she points with her band while the students turn their 
heads to watch what will happen next.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWhat'd I do?

<b>ttttTEACHER 
</b>ttStep up here!

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWhat'd I do?

<b>ttttTEACHER 
</b>ttYou should be ashamed of yourself.

The students, their heads still turned, look back at Alvy, now an adult, 
sitting in the last seat of the second row.

<b>ttttALVY (AS ADULT) 
</b>ttt(First off screen, then onscreen as 
tttcamera moves over to the back of the 
tttclassroom) 
ttWhy, I was just expressing a healthy sexual 
ttcuriosity.

<b>ttttTEACHER 
</b>ttt(The younger, Alvy standing next to her) 
ttSix-year-old boys don't have girls on 
tttheir minds.

<b>ttttALVY (AS ADULT) 
</b>ttt(Still sitting in the back of 
tttthe classroom) 
ttI did. 

The girl the young Alvy kissed turns to the older Alvy, she gestures and 
speaks.

<b>tttt1ST GIRL 
</b>ttFor God's sakes, Alvy, even Freud speaks 
ttof a latency period.

<b>ttttALVY (AS ADULT) 
</b>ttt(Gesturing) 
ttWell, I never had a latency period.  I 
ttcan't help it.

<b>ttttTEACHER
</b>ttt(With young, Alvy still at her side) 
ttWhy couldn't you have been more like Donald? 
ttt(The camera pans over to Donald, 
tttsitting up tall in his seat, then 
tttback to the teacher) 
ttNow, there was a model boy!

<b>ttttALVY (AS CHILD) 
</b>ttt(Still standing next to the teacher) 
ttTell the folks where you are today, Donald.

<b>ttttDONALD 
</b>ttI run a profitable dress company.

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE 
</b>ttRight.  Sometimes I wonder where my 
ttclassmates are today.

The camera shows the full classroom, the students sitting behind their desks, 
the teacher standing in the front of the room.  One at a time, the young 
students rise u from their desks and speak.

<b>tttt1ST BOY 
</b>ttI'm president of the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

<b>tttt2ND BOY 
</b>ttI sell tallises.

<b>tttt3RD BOY 
</b>ttI used to be a heroin addict.  Now I'm a 
ttmethadone addict.

<b>INT. ROOM
</b>
Close-up of a TV screen showing Alvy as an adult on a talk show.  He sits next 
to the show, host, Dick Cavett, a Navy man sits on his right.  Static is heard 
throughout the dialogue.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI lost track of most of my old schoolmates, 
ttbut I wound up a comedian.  They did not take 
ttme in the Army.  I was, uh ... Interestingly 
ttenough, I was-I was four-P.

Sounds of TV audience laughter and applause are heard.

<b>ttttDICK CAVETT 
</b>ttFour-P?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYes.  In-in-in-in the event of war, I'm a 
tthostage.

More audience laughter joined by Dick Cavett and the naval officer.

<b>INT. THE HOUSE WHERE ALVY GREW UP
</b>
Alvy's  mother sits at the old-fashioned dining-room table peeling carrots and 
talking as she looks off screen.

<b>ttttMOTHER 
</b>ttYou always only saw the worst in people.  
ttYou never could get along with anyone at 
ttschool.  You were always outta step with the 
ttworld.  Even when you got famous, you still 
ttdistrusted the world.'

<b>EXT. MANHATTAN STREET-DAY
</b>
A pretty Manhattan street with sidewalk trees, brownstones, a school; people 
mill about, some strolling and carrying bundles, others buried.  The screen 
shows the whole length of the sidewalk, a street, and part of the sidewalk 
beyond.  As the following scene ensues, two pedestrians, indistinguishable in 
the distance, come closer and closer toward the camera, recognizable, finally, 
as Alvy and his best friend, Rob, deep in conversation.  They eventually move 
past the camera and off screen.  Traffic noise is heard in the background.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI distinctly heard it.  He muttered under 
tthis breath, "Jew." 

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttYou're crazy!

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttNo, I'm not.  We were walking off the 
tttennis court, and you know, he was there 
ttand me and his wife, and he looked at her 
ttand then they both looked at me, and under 
tthis breath he said, "Jew."

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttAlvy, you're a total paranoid.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWh- How am I a paran-?  Well, I pick up on 
ttthose kind o' things.  You know, I was 
tthaving lunch with some guys from NBC, so 
ttI said ... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" 
ttand Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" 
ttNot, did you, didchoo eat?  Jew?  No, not 
ttdid you eat, but Jew eat?  Jew.  You get it?  
ttJew eat?

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttAh, Max, you, uh ...

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttStop calling me Max.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttWhy, Max?  It's a good name for you.  Max, 
ttyou see conspiracies in everything.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttNo, I don't!  You know, I was in a record 
ttstore.  Listen to this -so I know there's 
ttthis big tall blond crew-cutted guy and 
tthe's lookin' at me in a funny way and 
ttsmiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a 
ttsale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, 
ttWagner-so I know what he's really tryin' 
ttto tell me very significantly Wagner. 

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttRight, Max.  California, Max.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttAh.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttLet's get the hell outta this crazy city.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttForget it, Max.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>tt-we move to sunny L.A. All of show business 
ttis out there, Max.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttNo, I cannot.  You keep bringing it up, but 
ttI don't wanna live in a city where the only 
ttcultural advantage is that you can make a 
ttright turn on a red light.

<b>ttttROB
</b>ttt(Checking his watch) 
ttRight, Max, forget it.  Aren't you gonna be 
ttlate for meeting Annie?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman.  
ttI think I have a few minutes left.  Right?

<b>EXT. BEEKMAN THEATER-DAY
</b>
Alvy stands in front of glass doors of theater, the ticket taker behind him 
just inside the glass doors.  The sounds of city traffic, car horns honking, 
can be heard while he looks around waiting for, Annie. A man in a black leather
jacket, walking past the theater, stops in front of, Alvy.  He looks at him, 
then moves away.  He stops a few steps farther and turns around to look at Alvy
again.  Alvy looks away, then back at the man.  The man continues to stare. 
Alvy scratches his head, looking for Annie and trying not to notice the man. 
The man, still staring, walks back to Alvy.

<b>tttt1ST MAN 
</b>ttHey, you on television?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Nodding his head) 
ttNo. Yeah, once in a while.  You know, 
ttlike occasionally.

<b>tttt1ST MAN 
</b>ttWhat's your name?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Clearing his throat) 
ttYou wouldn't know it.  It doesn't matter.  
ttWhat's the difference?

<b>tttt1ST MAN 
</b>ttYou were on ... uh, the ... uh, the Johnny 
ttCarson, right?  

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttOnce in a while, you know.  I mean, you 
ttknow, every now-

<b>tttt1ST MAN 
</b>ttWhat's your name?

Alvy  is getting more and more uneasy as the man talks; more and more people 
move through the doors of the theater.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Nervously) 
ttI'm ... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford. 

<b>tttt1ST MAN 
</b>ttt(Laughing) 
ttCome on.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttAlvy Singer. It was nice nice ... Thanks 
ttvery much ... for everything.

They shake hands and Alvy pats the man's arm.  The man in turn looks over his 
shoulder and motions to another man. All excited now, he points to Alvy and 
calls out. Alvy looks impatient.

<b>tttt1ST MAN 
</b>ttHey!

<b>tttt2ND MAN

ttYeah, I do.  It's for my girl friend.

ttYour girl friend's name is Ralph?

<b>tttt2ND MAN 
</b>ttt(To Alvy, overlapping 1st man's speech) 
ttYou really Alvy Singer, the ... the 
ttTV star?

Nodding his head yes, Alvy shoves 2nd man aside and moves to the curb of the 
sidewalk.  The two men follow, still talking over the traffic noise.

<b>tttt1ST MAN 
</b>tt-Singer!

<b>tttt2ND MAN 
</b>ttAlvy Singer over here!

A cab moves into the frame and stops by the curb.  Alvy moves over to it about 
to get in.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Overlapping the two men and 
tttstuttering) 
ttI-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.

ttJesus, what'd you do, come by way of 
ttthe Panama Canal?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Overlapping Alvy) 
ttAlright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?  

Annie closes the cab door and she and Alvy move over to the ticket booth of 
the theater as they continue to talk.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttBad mood?  I'm standing with the cast of 
tt"The Godfather."

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYou're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttDeal!  I'm dealing with two guys named

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttI'm not getting my period.  Jesus, every

They move over to the ticket counter, people in front of them buying tickets 
and walking off screen.

ttA li-little louder.  I think one of them 
ttmay have missed it!

</b>ttTwo minutes, Alvy.

She moves past the ticket clerk.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Waving to Annie) 
ttGo ahead.  Good-bye. 

Annie moves back to Alvy and takes his arm.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttLook, while we're talking we could be

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Watching people with tickets move

</b>ttAlright.  All right, all right, so whatta

ttt(Annie nods her head and shrugs 
ttther shoulders disgustedly as Alvy,

ttther) 
ttSo let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOh, come on, we've seen it.  I'm not in

ttH'h, that's a polite word for what you are.

<b>INT. THEATER LOBBY.
</b>
A lined-up crowd of ticket holders waiting to get into the theater, Alvy and 
Annie among them.  A bum of indistinct chatter can be heard through the ensuing
scene.

<b>ttttMAN IN LINE 
</b>ttt(Loudly to his companion right 
tttbehind Alvy and Annie) 
ttWe saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.  
ttIt is not one of his best.  It lacks a 
ttcohesive structure.  You know, you get 
ttthe feeling that he's not absolutely sure 
ttwhat it is he wants to say.  'Course, I've 
ttalways felt he was essentially a-a technical 
ttfilm maker.  Granted, La Strada was a great 
ttfilm.  Great in its use of negative energy 
ttmore than anything else.  But that simple 
ttcohesive core ... 

Alvy, reacting to the man's loud monologue, starts to get annoyed, while Annie 
begins to read her newspaper.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Overlapping the man's speech) 
ttI'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.

ttHe's screaming his opinions in my ear.

<b>ttttMAN IN LINE

</b>ttStop it, Alvy!

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Wringing his hands) 
ttWell, he's spitting on my neck!  You know,

</b>ttt(Still going on) 
ttIt's a narrow view.

</b>ttProbably met by answering an ad in the

The man in front of them turns to look at them, then looks away.

Alvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back 
of the crowded lobby.  He moves over to a large stand-up movie poster and 
pulls Marshall McLuban from behind the poster.

</b>
Allison, clipboard in band, walks about the wings, stopping to talk to various 
people.  Musicians, performers and technicians mill about, busy with activity. 
Allison wears a large "ADLAI" button, as do the people around her.  The sounds 
of a comedian on the stage of the auditorium can be heard, occasionally, 
interrupted by chatter and applause from the off screen audience.  Allison 
stops to talk to two women; they, too, wear "ADLAI" buttons.

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttt(Looking down at the clipboard) 
ttMa'am, you're on right after this man ... 
ttabout twenty minutes, something like that.

turns to face him.

They move closer to the stage, looking out from the wings.

ttt(Off screen) 
ttThey-they they're laughed out.

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttt(Off screen) 
ttDo you feel all right?

As Allison and Alvy look out at the stage, the camera cuts to their point of 
view: a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of Adlai
Stevenson.  The audience, laughing and clapping, sits at round tables in 
clusters around the room.

The camera moves back to Allison and Alvy watching the stage.  Alvy is swinging
his hands nervously.

<b>ttttCOMEDIAN 
</b>ttt(Off screen, onstage) 
ttYou know ...

Alvy starts looking Allison up and down; people in the background mill about.

ttExcuse me, I'm not essentially a political

The audience starts to laugh.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI ... interestingly had, uh, dated ... 
tta woman in the Eisenhower Administration 
tt... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to 
ttme 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause I 
ttwas trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what 
ttEisenhower has been doing to the country 
ttfor the last eight years. 

The audience is with him, laughing, as Allison continues to watch offstage.

<b>INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM.
</b>
Allison and, Alvy are on the bed, kissing.  There are books all over the room; 
a fireplace, unlit, along one of the walls. Alvy suddenly breaks away and sits 
on the edge of the bed. Allison looks at him.

<b>ttttALVY  
</b>ttH'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with 
ttthis, because it-I can't get it off my 
ttmind, Allison ... it's obsessing me!

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttWell, I'm getting tired of it.  I need 
ttyour attention.

Alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room, 
gesturing with his hands.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttIt-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense.  
ttHe drove past the book depository and the 
ttpolice said conclusively that it was an 
ttexit wound.  So-how is it possible for 
ttOswald to have fired from two angles at 
ttonce?  It doesn't make sense.

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttAlvy.

Alvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs.  He then snaps his 
fingers and starts walking again.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI'll tell you this!  He was not marksman 
ttenough to hit a moving target at that 
ttrange.  But ... 
ttt(Clears his throat) 
ttif there was a second assassin ... it- 
ttThat's it!

Alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up 
from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf.

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttWe've been through this.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttIf they-they recovered the shells from 
ttthat rifle.

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttt(Moving back to the bed and 
tttlighting a cigarette) 
ttOkay.  All right, so whatta yuh saying,

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWell, why not?

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttYeah, Earl Warren?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Moving toward the bed) 
ttHey ... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttLyndon Johnson?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Propping one knee on the bed 
tttand gesturing) 
ttL-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttThen everybody's in in the conspiracy?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Nodding his head) 
ttTsch.

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttThe FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar 
ttHoover and oil companies and the 
ttPentagon and the men's-room attendant 
ttat the White House?

Alvy touches Allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking 
again.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI-I-I-I would leave out the men's-room 
ttattendant.

<b>ttttALLISON 
</b>ttYou're using this conspiracy theory as 
ttan excuse to avoid sex with me.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttOh, my God! 
ttt(Then, to the camera) 
ttShe's right!  Why did I turn off Allison 
ttPortchnik?  She was-she was beautiful.  She 
ttwas willing.  She was real ... intelligent. 
ttt(Sighing) 
ttIs it the old Groucho Marx joke?  That-that 
ttI-I just don't wanna belong to any club that 
ttwould have someone like me for a member?

<b>EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard over the wind-browned exterior of a beach 
house in the Hamptons. As they continue to talk, the camera moves inside the 
house. Alvy is picking up chairs, trying to get at the group of lobsters 
crawling on the floor.  Dishes are stacked up in a drying rack, and bags of 
groceries sit on the counter.  There's a table and chairs near the refrigerator. 

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttAlvy, now don't panic.  Please.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttLook, I told you it was a ... mistake 
ttto ever bring a live thing in the house.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttStop it!  Don't ... don't do that!  There.
<b> 
</b>The lobsters continue to crawl on the floor.  Annie, bolding out a wooden 
paddle, tries to shove them onto it.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWell, maybe we should just call the police.  
ttDial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttCome on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for 
ttGod's sake. 

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttIf they're only babies, then you pick 
tt'em up.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOh, all right.  All right!  It's all 
ttright.  Here.

She drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail.  Laughing, 
she shoves it at Alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttDon't give it to me.  Don't!

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Hysterically) 
ttOooh!  Here!  Here!

ttat night. 
ttt(They move over to the refrigerator; 
tttAlvy moves as close to the wall as 
tttpossible as Annie, covering her mouth 
tttand laughing hysterically, teasingly 
tttdangles a lobster in front of him) 
ttWill you get outta here with that thing?

ttGet him!

</b>ttt(Laughing) 
ttTalk to him.  You speak shellfish!

ttttakes the lid of a large steamer 
tttfilled with boiling water) 
ttHey, look ... put it in the pot.

<b>ttttANNIE

ttI can't!  I can't put him in the pot.  I

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Overlapping) 
ttGimme!  Gimme!  Let me do it!  What-what's 
tthe think we're gonna do, take him to the 
ttmovies?

Annie hands the lobster to Alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it 
gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Overlapping Alvy and making sounds) 
ttOh, God!  Here yuh go!  Oh, good, now

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Overlapping Annie) 
ttOkay, it's in.  It's definitely in the pot!

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttAll right.  All right.  All right.

She moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster.  Smiling, 
she places it on the counter as Alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to 
push it from the wall.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttAnnie, there's a big lobster behind 
ttthe refrigerator.  I can't get it out.  
ttThis thing's heavy.  Maybe if I put a

ttYeah.  I'm gonna get my ... I'm gonna

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYou know, I-I think ... if I could pry

tt'cause they don't have legs.  They don't 
ttrun around.

Annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle. 
Trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the 
chandelier.  Holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink.  
Annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttGreat!  Great!

ttAll right, here!  Oh, God, it's disgusting!

making a face.

</b>
<b>INT. NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT-NIGHT
</b>
A cocktail party is in progress, the rooms crowded with guests as Alvy and 
Robin make their way through the people.  A waiter, carrying a tray, walks 
past them.  Alvy reaches out to pick up a glass; Robin reaches over and picks 
it of the tray first.  There is much low-key chatter in the background.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Off screen) 
tt-two of them.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttThere's Henry Drucker.  He has a chair 
ttin history at Princeton.  Oh, the short 
ttman is Hershel Kaminsky.  He has a chair 
ttin philosophy at Cornell.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah, two more chairs and they got a 
ttdining-room set.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttWhy are you so hostile?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Sighing) 
tt'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on 
tttelevision.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttt(Squinting) 
ttIs that Paul Goodman?  No. And be nice 
ttto the host because he's publishing my 
ttbook.  Hi, Doug!  Douglas Wyatt.  
tt"A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart."

They move through the rooms, Robin holding a drink in one hand, her arm draped 
in Alvy's; the crowd mills around them.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Taking Robin's hand) 
ttI'm so tired of spending evenings making 
ttfake insights with people who work for 
ttDysentery.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttCommentary.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttOh, really, I heard that Commentary and 
ttDissent had merged and formed Dysentery.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttNo jokes-these are friends, okay?

<b>INT. BEDROOM
</b>
Alvy sits on the foot of the bed watching the Knicks game on television.

<b>ttttTV ANNOUNCER 
</b>ttt(Off screen) 
ttCleveland Cavaliers losing to the New 
ttYork Knicks.

Robin enters the room, slamming the door.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttHere you are.  There's people out there.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttHey, you wouldn't believe this.  Two 
ttminutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen 
ttpoints, and now ... 
ttt(Clears his throat) 
ttthey're ahead two points.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttAlvy, what is so fascinating about a group 
ttof pituitary cases trying to stuff the 
ttball through a hoop?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Looking at Robin) 
ttWhat's fascinating is that it's physical.  
ttYou know, it's one thing about intellectuals, 
ttthey prove that you can be absolutely brilliant 
ttand have no idea what's going on.  But on the 
ttother hand ... 
ttt(Clears his throat) 
ttthe body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.

Alvy reaches over, pulls Robin down onto the bed.  He kisses her and moves 
farther up on the bed.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttStop acting out.

She sits on the edge of the bed, looking down at the sprawled-out Alvy.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttNo, it'll be great!  It'll be great, 
ttbe-because all those Ph.D.'s are in 
ttthere, you know, like ... discussing 
ttmodels of alienation and we'll be in 
tthere quietly humping.

He pulls Robin toward him, caressing her as she pulls herself away.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttAlvy, don't!  You're using sex to 
ttexpress hostility.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>tt"'Why-why do you always r-reduce my

ttt(Clears his throat) 
tthe said as he removed her brassiere..."

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttt(Pulling away again) 
ttThere are people out there from The New

She gets up and fixes the zipper on her dress.  She turns and moves toward the 
door.

<b>INT. APARTMENT-NIGHT
</b>
Robin and Alvy are in bed.  The room is in darkness.  Outside, a siren starts 
blaring.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttOh, I'm sorry!

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttDon't get upset!

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttDammit!  I was so close.

She flips on the overhead lamp and turns on her side.  Alvy turns to her.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Gesturing) 
ttJesus, last night it was some guy honking 
tthis car horn.  I mean, the city can't 
ttclose down.  You know, what-whatta yuh

ttand not in New York.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWell, I can't li- We can't have this

ttmakes me nervous.  There's ... You got

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttt(Interrupting) 
ttOkay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm 
tttoo tense.  Where's the goddamn Valium?

She fumbles about the floor for the Valium, then back on the bed.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttHey, come on, it's quiet now.  We can-we 
ttcan start again.

<b>ttttROBIN 
</b>ttI can't.

</b>ttWell, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a 
ttseries of cold showers.

<b>EXT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM OF THE TENNIS CLUB.
</b>
Rob and Alvy, carrying tennis rackets, come through the door of the locker 
room to the lobby.  They are dressed in tennis whites.  They walk toward the 
indoor court.

<b>ttttROB
</b> tttMax, my serve is gonna send yuh to 
ttthe showers-

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttRight, right, so g-get back to what we 
ttwere discussing, the failure of the

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttMax, the city is terribly worried.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttBut the- I'm not discussing politics or 
tteconomics.  This is foreskin.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttNo, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient 
ttout.  Every time some group disagrees with 
ttyou it's because of anti-Semitism.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttDon't you see?  The rest of the country looks 
ttupon New York like we're-we're left-wing 
ttCommunist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers.  
ttI think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I 
ttlive here.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttMax, if we lived in California, we could 
ttplay outdoors every day, in the sun.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttSun is bad for yuh.  Everything our parents 
ttsaid was good is bad.  Sun, milk, red meat,

<b>INT. TENNIS COURT
</b>
Annie and Janet, in tennis whites, stand on the court holding tennis rackets 
and balls.  They are chattering and giggling.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Laughing) 
ttI know, but ooh- here he comes.  Okay. 

Rob and Alvy enter the court and walk over to the two women.  Rob kisses Janet 
and makes introduction.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttYou know Alvy?

<b>ttttJANET 
</b>ttOh, hi, Alvy.

</b>ttt(Overlapping Alvy) 
ttWell ... so ... I can't play too good,

<b>ttttJANET 
</b>ttt(Laughing) 
ttI've had four lessons!

The group, laughing and chatting, divide up-Rob and Annie moving to the other 
side of the net, Alvy and Janet standing where they are.  They start to play 
mixed doubles, each taking turns and playing well. At one point in the game, 
Annie starts to talk to Rob, then turns and sees a ball heading toward her.

<b>ttttALVY  
</b>ttt(Hitting the halt back) 
ttHoly gods!

<b>INT. LOBBY
</b>
Alvy, dressed, puts things into a gym bag.  One knee is on the bench and his 
back is turned from the entrance. Annie walks toward the entrance door dressed 
in street clothes and carrying her tennis bag over her shoulder.  Seeing Alvy,
she stops and turns.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttHi.  Hi, hi.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Looking over his shoulder) 
ttHi.  Oh, hi.  Hi.

ttYou-you play ... very well.

</b>ttOh, yeah?  So do you.  Oh, God, whatta-

ttWell ... oh, well ... la-de-da, la-de-da,

She turns around and moves toward the door.

</b>ttUh, well, you just said you were going 
ttdowntown.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYeah, well, I'm, but I ...

Alvy picks up his bag and moves toward the door. As he turns his bag around, 
the handle of the tennis racket bits Annie between the legs.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Laughing) 
ttSo sorry.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Laughing) 
ttI mean, I can go uptown, too.  I live

<b>EXT. NEW YORK STREET- DAY

Alvy and Annie in the VW as Annie speeds down a city street near the East River.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttSo, how long do you know Janet?  Where 
ttdo you know her from?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Laughing) 
ttOh, I'm in her acting class.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttOh - you're an actress.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttWell, I do commercials, sort of ...

She zooms down the wrong lane, cars swerving out of her way.  A horn blows.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI, uh ... well, you're not from New 
ttYork, right?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttNo, Chippewa Falls.

tttstaring out the window as Annie

ttSo, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?

Annie looks down beside her, searching for the gum.

</b>ttOkay.

front of a truck in Annie's windshield.  She swerves just in time.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>tt-for yuh.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOkay, that's good.

</b>ttI live over here.  Oh, my God!  Look!  
ttThere's a parking space!  

With brakes squealing, Annie turns the VW sharply into the parking spot.  
Annie and Alvy get out, Alvy looking over his shoulder as he leaves the car.

<b>ttttALVY   
</b>ttThat's okay, you ... we-we can walk to

<b>INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT

Alvy, standing, looks around the apartment.  There are lots of books, framed 
photographs on the white wall.  A terrace can be seen from the window.  He 
picks up a copy of Ariet, by Sylvia Platb, as Annie comes out of the kitchen 
carrying two glasses.  She hands them to Alvy.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttSylvia Plath.

ttSo, did you do shoot the photographs 
ttin there or what?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttt(Nodding, her hand on her hip) 
ttYeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.

Annie's thoughts pop on the screen as she talks: I dabble?  Listen to me-what 
a jerk!

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttThey're ... they're... they're wonderful, 
ttyou know.  They have ... they have, uh 
tt... a ... a quality.
<b>t
</b>As do Alvy's: You are a great-looking girl

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttWell, I-I-I would-I would like to take 
tta serious photography course soon.

Again, Annie's thoughts pop on: He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttPhotography's interesting, 'cause, you 
ttknow, it's-it's a new art form, and a, 
ttuh, a set of aesthetic criteria have 
ttnot emerged yet.

And Alvy's: I wonder what she looks like naked?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttAesthetic criteria?  You mean, whether 
ttit's, uh, good photo or not?

I'm not smart enough for him.  Hang in there

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttThe-the medium enters in as a condition 
ttof the art form itself.  That's-

I don't know what I'm saying-she senses I'm shallow

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttWell, well, I ... to me-I ... I mean, 
ttit's-it's-it's all instinctive, you 
ttknow.  I mean, I just try to uh, feel 
ttit, you know?  I try to get a sense of 
ttit and not think about it so much.

God, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a shmuck like the others

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttStill, still we- You need a set of 
ttaesthetic guide lines to put it in 
ttsocial perspective, I think.

Christ, I sound like FM radio.  Relax

They're quiet for a moment, holding wine glasses and sipping.  The sounds of 
distant traffic from the street can be heard on the terrace.  Annie, laughing, 
speaks first.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttWell, I don't know.  I mean, I guess-I 
ttguess you must be sorta late, huh?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYou know, I gotta get there and begin

ttI'd like to come. 
ttt(Laughing) 
ttOh, no, no, no, no, no!  No, I'm interested!

ttYeah.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttt(Overlapping) 
tt-you're gonna like night clubs, they're 
ttreally a lotta fun.

<b>INT. NIGHT CLUB-NIGHT
</b>
Annie stands on center stage with a microphone, a pianist behind her.  A 
Bright light is focused on her; the rest of the club is in darkness.  There 
are the typical sounds and movements of a nightclub audience: low conversation,
curling smoke, breaking glass, microphone bum, moving chairs, waiters 
clattering trays, a ringing phone as Annie sings "It Had to Be You.

<b>EXT. CITY STREET-NIGHT.
</b>
Alvy and Annie walk quickly down the sidewalk. 

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttI was awful.  I'm so ashamed!  I can't 
ttsing. 

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttOh, listen, so the audience was a tad 
ttrestless.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttWhatta you mean, a tad restless?  Oh, 
ttmy God, I mean, they hated me.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttNo, they didn't.  You have a wonderful

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttIt's terrific.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttt(Overlapping) 
ttYeah, you know something?  I never even 
tttook a lesson, either.

They stop in the middle of the sidewalk.  Alvy turns Annie around to face him.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttHey, listen, listen.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttWhat?

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttGimme a kiss.

<b>ttttANNIE

</b>ttOkay?

They kiss.

They turn and start walking again.

</b>ttWe can digest our-

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttOkay. Yeah.

<b>INT. DELI-NIGHT
</b>
Annie and Alvy sit down in a booth.  The deli is fairly well lit and crowded. 
Conversation, plates clattering, can be heard over the dialogue.  The waiter 
comes over to them to take their order.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(To the waiter) 
ttI'm gonna have a corned beef.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(To the waiter) 
ttYeah ... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a

ttTsch, so, uh, your second wife left you 
ttand, uh, were you depressed about that?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttNothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>INT. BOOKSTORE-DAY
</b>
Annie and Alvy browsing in crowded bookstore.  Alvy, carrying two books, 
"Death and Western Thought" and "The Denial of Death", moves over to where 
Annie is looking.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttHey?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttH'm?

<b>ttttALVY
</b> tttI-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I

ttread them.  You know, instead of that 
ttcat book.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttt(Looking at the books Alvy 
tttis bolding) 
ttThat's, uh ... 
ttt(Laughing) 
ttthat's pretty serious stuff there.

<b>ttttALVY
</b> tttYeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, 
ttI'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death,

ttYeah?

</b>ttYeah?

They move over to the cashier line.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttt(Gesturing) 
ttI've a very pessimistic view of life.  
ttYou should know this about me if we're 
ttgonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that 
ttlife is-is divided up into the horrible 
ttand the miserable.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttM'hm.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttThose are the two categories ...

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttM'hm.

<b>ttttALVY

</b> tttM'hm.

<b>ttttALVY
</b> tttYou know, and the miserable is everyone

ttYou're very lucky ... to be ... 
ttt(Overlapping Annie's laughter) 
tt... to be miserable.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttU-huh.

<b>EXT. PARK-DAY
</b>
It's a beautiful sunny day in Central Park.  People are sitting on benches, 
others strolling, some walking dogs.  One woman stands feeding cooing pigeons.
Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard off screen as they observe the scene before
them.  An older man and woman walk into view.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttLook, look at that guy.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttM'hm.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttThere's-there's-there's-there's Mr. 
ttWhen-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, 
ttyou know? 
ttt(Over Annie's laughter) 
ttHe's the latest! just came back from 
ttthe gin-rummy farm last night. He 
ttplaced third.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttt(Laughing) 
ttM'hm.  Yeah.  Yeah.

The camera shows them sitting side by side relaxed on a bench.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Watching two men approach, one 
tttlighting a cigar) 
ttLook at these guys.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttYeah.

<b>ttttALVY   
</b>ttOh, that's hilarious.  They're back 
ttfrom Fire Island.  They're ... they're 
ttsort of giving it a chance-you know what 
ttI mean?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>   tttOh! Italian, right?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>  tttYeah, he's the Mafia.  Linen Supply Business 
ttor Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttt(Laughing) 
ttOh, yeah.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttNo, I'm serious. 
ttt(Over Annie's laughter) 
ttI just got my mustache wet.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOh, yeah?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(As another man walks by) 
ttAnd there's the winner of the Truman 
ttCapote look-alike contest.

<b>EXT. STREET-NIGHT
</b>
Alvy and Annie walk almost in silhouette along the dock, the New York City 
skyline in the background.  Alvy has his arm around Annie and they walk slowly.
No one else is around.

<b>ttttANNIEt
</b>ttYou see, like you and I ...

<b>ttttALVYt
</b>ttYou are extremely sexy.

<b>ttttANNIEt
</b>ttNo, I'm not.

<b>ttttALVYt
</b>ttUnbelievably sexy.  Yes, you are.  
ttBecause ... you know what you are?  
ttYou're-you're polymorphously perverse.

<b>ttttANNIEt
</b>ttWell, what does-what does that mean?  
ttI don't know what that is.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttUh ... uh, you're-you're exceptional 
ttin bed because you got -you get pleasure 
ttin every part of your body when I touch you.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOoooh!

They stop walking.  Holding Annie's arms, Alvy turns her to face him.  The 
South Street Bridge, lit up for the night, is in the background.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYou know what I mean?  Like the tip 
tto'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth 
ttor your kneecaps ... you get excited.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttCome on. 
ttt(Laughing) 
ttYeah.  You know what?  You know, I 
ttlike you, I really mean it.  I really do 
ttlike you.

</b>ttYou- Do you love me?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttDo I love you?

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttThat's the key question.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttI know you've only known me a short 
ttwhile.

</b>ttWell, I certainly ... I think that's

ttt(Laughing) 
ttyeah.  Do you love me?

ttYou know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.

ttI-I have to invent- Of course I love you.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttYeah.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Putting his arms around her neck) 
ttDon't you think I do?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttI dunno.

They kiss as a foghorn sounds in the distance.

<b>INT. ALVY'S APARTMENT
</b>
Alvy, somewhat distraught, is following Annie around his apartment, which is 
filled with boxes and suitcases, clothes and framed pictures.  They both carry 
cartons.

<b>ttttALVY
</b> tttWhatta you mean?  You're not gonna give 
ttup your own apartment, are you?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttt(Putting down the carton) 
ttOf course.

tttpictures and carton in band, still 
ttttalking) 
tt... rapidly growing field.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttYou don't want me to live with you?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttHow- I don't want you to live with me?  
ttHow- Whose idea was it?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttMine.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYe-ah.  Was it ... It was yours actually, 
ttbut, uh, I approved it immediately.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttI guess you think that I talked you into

ttt(putting pictures on the mantel) 
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttALVY
</b>ttNo-what, what ...? I ... we live together,

ttyou don't want it to be like we're married,

He moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in.  He 
starts tossing books off screen.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttt(Looking up at Alvy) 
ttHow is it any different?

<b>ttttALVY  
</b>ttt(Gesturing) 
ttIt's different 'cause you keep your own

tttaround the room) 
ttBecause you know it's there, we don't 
tthave to go to it, we don't have to deal

He tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat.

ttThat little apartment is four hundred 
ttdollars a month, Alvy.

<b>EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
Annie and Alvy, in Annie's VW, driving to their summerhouse.  The camera moves 
with them as they pass a house with a lighted window, blooming foliage.  There 
is no dialogue, but it is a comfortable quiet.  Classical music plays in the 
background.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT

Annie, sitting cross-legged on a wooden chest in the bedroom, is browsing 
through a school catalogue.  Alvy lies in bed reading.

ttDoes this sound like a good course?  
ttUh, "Modern American Poetry"?  Uh, or,

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Yelling out to her as she leaves

ttYeah, grass, right?  The illusion that

ttWell, have you ever made love high?

</b>ttt(Closing the door) 
ttWell, what's the difference, anyway?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWell, I'll give you a shot of sodium

tttout the lamp on the night table) 
ttHang in there for a second.  I got a 
ttlittle-little artifact.  A little erotic 
ttartifact, that-that I brought up from the 
ttcity, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. 
ttt(He turns the lamp back on, having 
tttreplaced the bulb with the red one 
tttfrom the closet) 
ttI just ... there ... There's a little Old 
ttNew Orleans ... essence.  Now-now we can go 
ttabout our business here and we can even 
ttdevelop photographs if we want to.  There, 
ttnow there. 
ttt(He undresses and crawls into bed, 
ttttaking Annie in his arms) 
ttM'mmm.  M'mmm.  Hey, is something wrong?  

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>
ttUh-uh-why?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI don't know.  You- It's like you're-
ttyou're removed.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttNo, I'm fine.

As Annie speaks, her inner self (ghostlike, moves up from the bed and) sits 
down on a chair, watching.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttReally?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttU-huh.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI don't know, but you seem sort of distant. 

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttLet's just do it, all right?

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttt(Kissing and caressing Annie) 
ttIs it my imagination or are you just 
ttgoing through the motions?

<b>ttttANNIE'S SPIRIT  
</b>ttAlvy, do you remember where I put my 
ttdrawing pad?  Because while you two are 
ttdoing that, I think I'm gonna do some 
ttdrawing.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Reacting) 
ttYou see, that's what I call removed.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOh, you have my body.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah, but that's not-that's no good.  
ttI want the whole thing. 

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Sighing) 
ttWell, I need grass and so do you.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWell, it ruins it for me if you have grass 
ttt(Clearing his throat)
tt because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Overlapping) 
ttM'hm.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Overlapping) 
tt-so if I get a laugh from a person who's 
tthigh, it doesn't count.  You know-'cause 
ttthey're always laughin'.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttWere you always funny?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttHey, what is this-an interview?  We're 
ttsupposed to be making love.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. OFFICE.
</b>
A typical old-fashioned theatrical agency in a Broadway office building. 
Autographed 8 X 12 is plastered in the sloppy room.  The agent, chewing a 
cigar, sits behind his desk talking to one of his clients, a comedian, who 
stands with his hands in his pockets.  A young Alvy sits stiffly in a chair 
nearby watching.

<b>ttttAGENT 
</b>ttThis guy is naturally funny.  I think 
tthe can write for you.

<b>ttttCOMIC 
</b>ttt(Buttoning his jacket) 
ttYeah, yeah.  Hey, kid, he tells me you're 
ttreally good.  Well, lemme explain a little 
ttbit o' how I work.  You know, you can tell 
ttright off the bat that I don't look like 
tta funny guy when I come-you know, like some 
tto' the guys that come out.  You know, right 
ttaway 
ttt(Gesturing) 
ttthey're gonna tell yuh their stories, you're 
ttgonna fall down, but I gotta be really 
tttalented.  Material's gotta be sensational 
ttfor me 'cause I work, you know, with very, 
ttvery ... Come on, I'm kinda classy, you 
ttknow what I mean?  Uh ... uh ... lemme 
ttexplain.  For instance, I open with an 
ttopening song.  A musical start like 
ttt(Ad-lib singing) 
ttand I walk out 
ttt(Ad-lib singing)  
tt"Place looks wonderful from here and 
ttyou folks look wonderful from here! 
ttt(Singing)
tt"And seein' you there
ttWith a smile on your face
ttMakes me shout
ttThis must be the place."
ttThen I stop right in the middle and then 
ttI open with some jokes.  Now, that's where 
ttI need you, right there.  For instance, like 
ttI say, "Hey, I just got back from Canada, 
ttyou know, they speak a lotta French up 
ttthere.  The only way to remember Jeanne 
ttd'Arc means the light's out in the bathroom!" 
ttt(He laughs.  Seated Alvy looks 
tttup smiling) 
tt"Oh, I met a big lumberjack ..."

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE 
</b>ttt(To himself) 
ttJesus, this guy's pathetic. 

<b>ttttCOMIC 
</b>ttt(Overlapping above speech) 
tt... big lumberjack ...

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE 
</b>ttt(To himself while the comic 
tttcontinues his routine) 
ttLook at him mincing around, like he 
ttthinks he's real cute.  You wanna throw 
ttup.  If only I had the nerve to do my 
ttown jokes.  I don't know how much longer 
ttI can keep this smile frozen on my face.  
ttI'm in the wrong business, I know it.

<b>ttttCOMIC 
</b>ttt(Overlapping above speech) 
tt"'Cherie, come back.  I love you. 
ttt(Shaking his lips and mimicking) 
ttBut, uh, Cheri, what will I do with this, 
ttuh?' He says, 'Aw, Marie, sometime you 
ttmake me so mad."' 
ttt(Laughing) 
ttOh, they scream at that.  Now, write me 
ttsomethin' like that, will yuh?  Kinda 
ttFrench number, can yuh do it?  Huh, kid?

<b>INT. THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
The darkened auditorium is filled with college students applauding and cheering,
excited, as Alvy stands on spotlighted stage holding the microphone.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Gesturing) 
ttW-where am I? I-I keep ... I have to 
ttreorient myself.  This is the University 
ttof Wisconsin, right?  So I'm always ... 
ttI'm tense and ... uh, when I'm playin' a 
ttcol- I've a very bad history with colleges.  
ttYou know, I went to New York University and, 
ttuh, tsch, I was thrown out of NYU my freshman 
ttyear ... for cheating on my metaphysics final.  
ttYou know, I looked within the soul of the 
ttboy sitting next to me- 
ttt(The audience laughs; they're with him)
tt -and when I was thrown out, my mother, 
ttwho's an emotionally high-strung woman, 
ttlocked herself in the bathroom and took an 
ttoverdose of mah-jongg tiles. 
ttt(More applause and laughter) 
ttAnd, uh, tsch, I was depressed.  I was ... 
ttin analysis, I-I, uh, was suicidal; as a 
ttmatter of fact, uh, I would have killed 
ttmyself but I was in analysis with a strict 
ttFreudian and if you kill yourself ... they 
ttmake you pay for the sessions you miss.

<b>INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER.
</b>
Students mill around Alvy banding him pens and paper for autographs.
Annie is next to him, talking over the chattering fans.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttAlvy, you were ... Alvy, you were just 
ttgreat, I'm not kidding.  It was- You 
ttwere so neat.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttC-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYeah.  Yeah.  And you know something?  
ttI think that I'm starting to get more 
ttof your references, too.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttAre yuh?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWell, the twelve o'clock show is 
ttcompletely different than the nine.

<b>ttttYOUNG WOMAN 
</b>ttt(Interrupting) 
ttMay I have your autograph?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Over lapping above speech) 
ttOh.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(To Annie, while autographing) 
ttYou're so sure about it.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to 
tttomorrow.  I mean, you know, I think that 
ttit'll be really nice to meet Mother and 
ttFather. 

They start moving toward the exit, a girl snapping a picture of Alvy with a 
flash camera as they walk through the crowd.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately. 
ttt(To one of his fans) 
ttThank you.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttNo, I don't think so.  No, I don't think 
ttthey're gonna hate you at all.  On the 
ttcontrary, I think-

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttIt's Easter.  You know, we'll have a nice 
ttdinner, we'll sit down and eat.  I think 
ttthey're gonna really like you.

<b>EXT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' HOME-DAY
</b>
The camera shows a neat two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured green 
lawn, then cuts to:

<b>INT. DINING ROOM.
</b>
Alvy and the Halls are eating Easter dinner.  The sun is pouring through a big 
picture window, shining on a large, elegantly laid out table. Alvy sits, at one
end,- rubbing his nose and chewing, the Halls flanking him on either side: Mr.
and Mrs. Hall, Grammy, and Annie's brother, Duane.

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttt(Holding her wine glass) 
ttIt's a nice ham this year, Mom. 

Grammy Hall takes a sip of her wine and nods.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Smiling at Duane) 
ttOh, yeah.  Grammy always does such 
tta good job.

<b>ttttDAD HALL 
</b>ttt(Chewing) 
ttA great sauce.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttIt is. 
ttt(Smacking his lips) 
ttIt's dynamite ham.

Grammy Hall stares down the table at Alvy; a look of utter dislike. Alvy tries 
not to notice.

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttt(To Dad Hall, smoothing her hair) 
ttWe went over to the swap meet.  Annie, 
ttGram and I. Got some nice picture frames.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttWe really had a good time.

Grammy continues to stare at Alvy; he is now dressed in the long black coat and
hat of the Orthodox Jew, complete with mustache and heard.

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttt(Lighting a cigarette and turning 
tttto Alvy) 
ttAnn tells us that you've been seeing a 
ttpsychiatrist for fifteen years.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Setting down his glass and coughing) 
ttYes.  I'm making excellent progress.  
ttPretty soon when I lie down on his couch, 
ttI won't have to wear the lobster bib.

Mom Hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning.  Grammy continues to 
stare.

<b>ttttDAD HALL 
</b>ttDuane and I went out to the boat basin.

<b>ttttDUANE 
</b>ttWe were caulkin' holes all day.

<b>ttttDAD HALL 
</b>ttYeah. 
ttt(Laughing) 
ttRandolph Hunt was drunk, as usual.

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttOh, that Randolph Hunt.  You remember 
ttRandy Hunt, Annie.  He was in the choir 
ttwith you.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOh, yes, yes.

Alvy, leaning his elbow on the table, looks out toward the camera.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(To the audience) 
ttI can't believe this family. 
ttt(Making chewing sounds) 
ttAnnie's mother.  She really's beautiful.  
ttAnd they're talkin' swap meets and boat 
ttbasins, and the old lady at the end of 
ttthe table 
ttt(Pointing to Grammy) 
ttis a classic Jew hater.  And, uh, they, 
ttthey realty look American, you know, 
ttvery healthy and ... like they never 
ttget sick or anything.  Nothing like my 
ttfamily.  You know, the two are like oil 
ttand water.

The screen splits in half - on the right is Alvy's family - his mother, father,
aunt and uncle-busily eating at the crowded kitchen table.  They eat quickly 
and interrupt one another loudly.  On the left the Halls in their dining room. 
Both dialogues overlap, juxtaposed.

<b>ttttALVY'S FATHER 
</b>ttLet 'im drop dead!  Who needs his 
ttbusiness?!

<b>ttttALVY'S MOTHER 
</b>ttHis wife has diabetes!

<b>ttttALVY'S FATHER 
</b>ttDi-diabetes?  Is that any excuse?  
ttDiabetes?

<b>ttttALVY'S UNCLE 
</b>ttThe man is fifty years old and doesn't 
tthave a substantial job.

<b>ttttALVY'S AUNT 
</b>ttt(Putting more meat on her 
ttthusband's plate) 
ttIs that a reason to steal from his father?

<b>ttttALVY'S UNCLE 
</b>ttWhatta you talkin' about?  You don't 
ttknow what you're talking about.

<b>ttttALVY'S AUNT 
</b>ttYes, I know what I'm talking about.

<b>ttttALVY'S MOTHER 
</b>ttt(Interrupting) 
ttGeorge, defend him!

<b>ttttALVY'S UNCLE 
</b>ttt(Over Alvy's father's muttering) 
ttNo Moskowitz he had a coronary.

<b>ttttALVY'S AUNT 
</b>ttYou don't say.

<b>ttttALVY'S MOTHER 
</b>ttWe fast.

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttStupid Thelma Poindexter ... to the 
ttVeterans Hospital.

<b>ttttDAD HALL 
</b>ttMy God, he's the new president of the 
ttEl Regis.  Let me tell you, the man is 
ttsomethin' else.

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttThat's Jack's wife.  We used to make 
ttthat outta raisins.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOh, yes, that's right.  Did you see 
ttthe new play?

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttOh, you remember her, Annie.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYes, I do.

The two families start talking back and forth to one another.  The screen is 
still split.

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttHow do you plan to spend the holidays, 
ttMrs. Singer?

<b>ttttDAD HALL 
</b>ttFast?

<b>ttttALVY'S FATHER 
</b>ttYeah, no food.  You know, we have to 
ttatone for our sins.

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttWhat sins?  I don't understand.

<b>ttttALVY'S FATHER 
</b>ttTell you the truth, neither do we.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. DUANE'S BEDROOM-NIGHT
</b>
Duane, sitting on his bed, sees Alvy walking past the open door.

<b>ttttDUANE 
</b>ttAlvy.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Walking in) 
ttOh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?

<b>ttttDUANE 
</b>ttThis is my room.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Looking around) 
ttOh, yeah? 
ttt(He clears his throat) 
ttTerrific.

<b>ttttDUANE 
</b>ttCan I confess something?

Alvy sighs and sits down, leaning his arm on Duane's dresser.  Duane's face is 
big lighted by a single lamp.

<b>ttttDUANE 
</b>ttI tell you this because, as an artist, 
ttI think you'll understand.  Sometimes 
ttwhen I'm driving ... on the road at night
tt... I see two headlights coming toward me.  
ttFast.  I have this sudden impulse to turn 
ttthe wheel quickly, head-on into the 
ttoncoming car.  I can anticipate the 
ttexplosion.  The sound of shattering glass.  
ttThe ... flames rising out of the flowing 
ttgasoline.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Reacting and clearing his throat) 
ttRight.  Tsch, well, I have to-I have 
ttt-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due 
ttback on the planet earth. 

He slowly gets up and moves toward the door.

<b>INT. THE HALLS' LIVING ROOM.
</b>
Mom and Dad Hall walk into the living room; Annie is with them.

<b>ttttMOM HALL
</b>ttNow, don't let it be so long, now.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttDAD HALL 
</b>ttAnd look up Uncle Bill, you promise. 

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOkay.  Okay.

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttOh, he's adorable, Annie.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYou think so?  Do you really?

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttWe're going to take them to the airport.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttDAD HALL 
</b>ttOh, no-Duane can.  I haven't finished 
ttmy drink. 

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYes, Duane is.  I'll be right-

<b>ttttMOM HALL 
</b>ttM'mmm.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttI just have time to get the, uh-

She walks out of the room as Mom and Dad Hall kiss.

<b>EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
Duane, behind the wheel, stares straight ahead.  It is raining very hard, the 
windshield wipers are moving quickly.  The headlights of another car brightens 
the interior of Duane's car as the camera shows first Duane, then Annie, then 
Alvy tensely staring straight ahead.

<b>EXT. STREET- DAY
</b>
The camera bolds on a quiet New York City street; the buildings, brownstones. 
It's a warm day-people sit on front stoops, window boxes are planted. Annie 
walks into the frame first, then Alvy, who is walking to her right. They walk 
quickly, side by side, their voices heard before they move into the frame.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Off screen) 
ttYou followed me.  I can't believe it!

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Off screen) 
ttI didn't follow you!

<b>ttttANNIE  
</b>ttYou followed me!

<b>ttttALVY   
</b>ttWhy?  'Cause I ... was walkin' along 
tta block behind you staring at you?  
ttThat's not following!

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttWell, what is your definition of 
ttfollowing?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Gasping) 
ttFollowing is different.  I was spying.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttDo you realize how paranoid you are?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttParanoid?  I'm looking at you.  You 
ttgot your arms around another guy.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttThat is the worst kind of paranoia.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah-well, I didn't start out spying.  
ttI-I thought I'd surprise yuh.  Pick you 
ttup after school.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYeah-well, you wanted to keep the 
ttrelationship flexible, remember?  
ttIt's your phrase.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttOh, stop it.  But you were having an 
ttaffair with your college professor.  
ttThat jerk that teaches that incredible 
ttcrap course "Contemporary Crisis in 
ttWestern Man"!

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>tt"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"!  
ttYou're really close.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWhat's the difference?  It's all mental 
ttmasturbation.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Stopping for a moment) 
ttOh, well, now we're finally getting to 
tta subject you know something about!

She walks away.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Catching up to her) 
ttHey, don't knock masturbation!  It's 
ttsex with someone I love.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Continuing to walk quickly) 
ttWe're not having an affair.  He's married.  
ttHe just happens to think I'm neat.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Still walking next to her) 
tt"Neat"!  There's that- What are you-twelve 
ttyears old?  That's one o' your Chippewa 
ttFalls expressions!  "He thinks I'm neat."

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttWho cares?  Who cares?

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttNext thing you know he'll find you keen
ttand peachy, you know?  Next thing you 
ttknow he's got his hand on your ass!  

They both stop in the middle of the street.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYou've always had hostility toward 
ttDavid ever since I mentioned him!

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttDavid?  You call your teacher David?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttIt's his name.

<b>ttttALVY
</b> tttWell, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's 
tta biblical name.  Right?  W-What does 
tthe call you?  Bathsheba?

He walks away.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Calling after him) 
ttAlvy!  Alvy!  You're the one who never 
ttwanted to make a real commitment.  You 
ttdon't think I'm smart enough!  We had 
ttthat argument just last month, or don't 
ttou remember that day?

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. KITCHEN.
</b>
Alvy is at the sink washing dishes as the screen cuts to the scene of last 
month's argument.  Annie's voice is heard.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Off screen) 
ttI'm home!

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Turning) 
ttOh, yeah?  How'd it go?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Comes into the kitchen and puts 
tttdown a bag of groceries on the 
tttkitchen table) 
ttOh, it was ... 
ttt(Laughing) 
ttreally weird.  But she's a very nice woman.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttAnd I didn't have to lie down on the couch, 
ttAlvy, she had me sitting up.  So I told her 
ttabout-about the-the family and about my 
ttfeelings toward men and about my 
ttrelationship with my brother.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttM'm.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttAnd then she mentioned penis envy ... 
ttDid you know about that?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttMe?  I'm-I'm one of the few males who 
ttsuffers from that, so, so ... you know.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttM'hm.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttG-go on, I'm interested.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttWell, she said that I was very guilty 
ttabout my impulses toward marriage, 
ttand-and children.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttM'hm.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttAnd then I remembered when I was a kid 
tthow I accidentally saw my parents making 
ttlove.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttTsch.  Rea- All this happened in the 
ttfirst hour?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttM'hm.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttThat's amazing. I-I-I ... I've been 
ttgoin' for fifteen years, I-you know, 
ttI don't got ... nothing like that in-

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOh, I told her my dream and then I cried.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttYou cried?  I've never once cried.  
ttFantastic ...

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttt(Taking groceries from the bag) 
ttYeah.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttI whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttIn-in ... Alvy, in my dream Frank 
ttSinatra is holding his pillow across 
ttmy face and I can't breathe.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttSinatra?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttYeah, and he's strangling me ...

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>tt... and I keep, you know, it's-

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Taking a bottle of juice and 
tttsome celery from the bag) 
ttWell, well, sure ... because he's a 
ttsinger and you're a singer, you know, 
ttso it's perfect.  So you're trying to 
ttsuffocate yourself.  It-it makes perfect 
ttsense.  Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic 
tt... kind of insight.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Pointing her finger at Alvy) 
ttShe said, your name was Alvy Singer.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Turning to Annie) 
ttWhatta you mean?  Me?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYeah, yeah, yeah, you.  Because in the 
ttdream ... I break Sinatra's glasses.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Putting his band to his mouth) 
ttSinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra 
tthad glasses.  So whatta you saying that 
ttI-I'm suffocating you?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Turning, ajar in her hand) 
ttOh, and God, Alvy, I did ... this really 
ttterrible thing to him.  Because then when 
tthe sang it was in this real high-pitched 
ttvoice.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Thinking) 
ttTsch, what'd the doctor say?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Putting away some groceries)
ttWell, she said that I should probably 
ttcome five times a week.  And you know 
ttsomething?  I don't think I mind analysis 
ttat all.  The only question is, Will it 
ttchange my wife?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWill it change your wife?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttWill it change my life?

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttYeah, but you said, "Will it change 
ttmy wife"!

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttNo, I didn't. 
ttt(Laughing) 
ttI said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttYou said, "Will it change. . ." Wife.  
ttWill it change ...

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttt(Yelling out, angry) 
ttLife.  I said, "life."

Alvy turns toward the camera.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(To the audience) 
ttShe said, "Will it change my wife." You 
ttheard that because you were there so I'm

</b> tttAnd, Alvy ... and then I told her about

ttme seriously, because you don't think that 
ttI'm smart enough.

She walks out of the room.

<b>ttttALVY
</b> tttt(To Annie's back, gesturing) 
ttWhy do you always bring that up?  Because

ttYou meet wonderful, interesting professors'.

Annie stands at the open door of a cab, Alvy next to her gesturing as people 
and cars move by.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttAdult education is such junk!  The 
ttprofessors are so phony.  How can you 
ttdo it?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttA bit rapidly.  I don't care what you

ttI just think we oughta call this

Annie gets into the cab; Alvy leans over and closes the door.

<b>ALVY
</b> tttThat's fine.  That's fine.  That's great! 
ttt(He turns toward the camera as the 
tttcab drives away) 
ttWell, I don't know what I did wrong.

ttI mean, I can't believe this.  Somewhere

ttt(He walks up to an older woman 
tttwalking down the street carrying 
tttgroceries) 
ttIs it-is it something that I did?

</b>ttNever something you do.  That's how

She moves on down the street.

<b>ALVY
</b> tttt(Scratching his head) 
ttLove fades.  God, that's a depressing
ttthought. Have to ask you a question. 
ttt(He stops another passer-by,a man) 
ttDon't go any further.  Now, with your

He walks on.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Continuing to walk) 
ttLarge vibrating egg.  Well, I ask a 
ttpsychopath, I get that kind of an answer.  
ttJesus, I-I, uh, here ... 
ttt(He moves up the sidewalk to 
ttta young trendy-looking couple, 
tttarms wrapped around each other) 
ttYou-you look like a really happy couple.  
ttUh, uh ... are you?

<b>ttttYOUNG WOMAN
</b> tttYeah.

<b>ttttALVY
</b> tttYeah!  So ... so h-h-how do you account 
ttfor it?

<b>ttttYOUNG WOMAN 
</b>ttUh, I'm very shallow and empty and I 
tthave no ideas and nothing interesting 
ttto say.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN 
</b>ttAnd I'm exactly the same way.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI see.  Well, that's very interesting.  
ttSo you've managed to work out something, huh?

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN 
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttYOUNG WOMAN
</b> tttYeah.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttOh, well, thanks very much for talking 
ttto me.

He continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street. A 
mounted policeman comes by and stops near him. Alvy looks at the horse, as if 
to speak.

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
</b>ttYou know, even as a kid I always went 
ttfor the wrong women.  I think that's my 
ttproblem.  When my mother took me to see 
ttSnow White, everyone fell in love with 
ttSnow White.  I immediately fell for the 
ttWicked Queen.

The scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs.  The Wicked Queen, resembling Annie, sits in the palace before her 
mirror.  Alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of 
him.

<b>ttttWICKED QUEEN 
</b>ttWe never have any fun anymore.

</b> tttYou're just upset.  You must be getting

<b>ttttWICKED QUEEN
</b> tttI don't get a period!  I'm a cartoon

Rob, as a cartoon figure, enters and sits down on the other side of the Wicked 
Queen.

</b>ttMax, will you forget about Annie?  I 
ttknow lots of women you can date.

</b> tttI don't wanna go out with any other women.

<b>ttttCARTOON FIGURE ROB   
</b>ttMax, have I got a girl for you.  You are
ttgoing to love her.  She's a reporter-

The cartoon figures of Alvy and Rob walk past the Wicked Queen; the screen 
dissolves into the interior of a concert ball.  Rob's voice carries over from 
the cartoon scene as the screen shows Alvy with the female reporter.  It's very
crowded, noisy; policeman and reporters are everywhere. Alvy stands with his 
hands in his pockets, watching the commotion.

<b>ttttCARTOON FIGURE ROB'S VOICE-OVER 
</b>tt-for Rolling Stone.

</b> tttI think there are more people here to

ttlike a woman Yes, she does And she aches

The reporter is sitting up in bed, lighted cigarette in her hand.  Alvy, lying
next to her, rubs his eyes and puts on his eyeglasses.

ttI hope you don't mind that I took so long

He hangs up.  The reporter sits in bed still, taking in the situation.

</b> tttWell, okay.  Oooh.

Alvy stands in the middle of the bathroom, tennis racquet in one band, rolled
magazine in the other.  He looks over at the shelf above the sink and picks up 
a small container.  He holds it out, shouting off screen to Annie.

ttWhat an asshole!

A group of women stands near a buffet table eating and listening to Alvy 
mother and her sister, Tessie, and a young girl, as the three friends watch.

<b>ttttALVY'S MOTHER
</b> tttI was always the sister with good common

ttDo you believe that, Max?  Tessie 
ttMoskowitz had the personality.  She's

ttI was very charming.

</b> tttThere were many men interested in you?

<b>ttttTESSIE

ttOh, I was quite a lively dancer.

Tessie gyrates back and forth imitating a dancer while Annie and the adult 
Alvy lean on each other laughing.

<b>ttttROB

ttThat's pretty hard to believe.

<b>EXT. STREET.

Alvy and Annie walk contentedly down a street; Alvy's arm is draped around

loudly as the music fades out.

</b> tttt(Laughing) 
ttThank you.

Alvy sits at the bar, clapping and staring at Annie as she walks over to him

<b>INT. MOVIE THEATER.
</b>
The screen is projecting the beginning of "The Sorrow and the Pity": a street 
filled with fleeing cars, belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats. 
Subtitles pop on:

"The Jewish warmongers and
Parisian plutocrats tried
to flee with their gold and jewels"

as a narrator explains in German.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO.
</b>
Split screen: Annie and her psychiatrist on the left; Alvy and his on the 
right. Annie, talking, sits in a white molded chair, as does her doctor.  
The office is very modern: stark, white and chrome. Alvy, talking to his 
psychiatrist, lies on a deep leather sofa, the doctor seated away from him.  
This office looks more like a well-worn den: bookcases overflowing, dark wood.
The dialogue is separated in each screen, though no one talks simultaneously.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttt(To her doctor) 
ttThat day in Brooklyn was the last day 
ttI remember really having a great time.

carols; Annie continues to take pictures.

Reacting, Alvy puts up his band in disgust, then starts eating the piece of 
chicken he has been holding.  The doctor and Annie watch him, reacting.

ttYes, excuse me.

Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's car pull into a long circular driveway as an 
attendant walks over to the car.  A sprawling house is seen to the right; a 
couple moves toward the front door, and the driveway is crowded with other 
parked cars.  Loud music is heard.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Getting out of the car) 
ttHey, don't tell me we're gonna hafta 
ttwalk from the car to the house.  Geez, 
ttmy feet haven't touched pavement since

<b>INT. HOUSE
</b>
A Hollywood Christmas party is in session, complete with music, milling people,
circulating waiters bolding out trays of drinks.  It's all very casual. French 
doors run the entire width of one wall; they are opened to the back lawn, 
guests move from the room to outside and back in.  It is crowded; bits of 
conversation and clinking glasses can be heard.  Two men, California-tanned, 
stand by the French doors talking.

<b>tttt1ST MAN 
</b>ttWell, you take a meeting with him, I'll 
tttake a meeting with you if you'll take 
tta meeting with Freddy.

<b>tttt2ND MAN

A man stands talking, people in groups behind him.  Two born like gadgets are 
attached to his shoulders; he's wearing a bizarre space costume.

<b>tttt3RD MAN 
</b>ttRight now it's only a notion, but I 
ttthink I can get money to make it into

ttan idea.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
Alvy and Rob stand near the French doors leading to the back lawn, eating and 
drinking and watching the people walking in and out of the house.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttYou like this house, Max?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttM'hm.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttI even brought a road map to get us to 
ttthe bathroom.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWhee, you shoulda told me it was Tony 
ttLacey's party.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttWhat difference does that make?

Alvy looks into the room, where Annie and Tony Lacey are having an animated 
conversation.

<b>ALVY 
</b>ttI think he has a little thing for Annie.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttOh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max.  He 
ttgoes with that girl over there.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttWhere?

Rob nods his head toward a tall woman dressed all in white conversing with a 
group of people close-by.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttThe one with the V.P.L.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b><b>ttV.P.L.?
</b>

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great 
ttfor you because you're -you're used to

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttThere are no twos, Max.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttM'hm.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttAnd ... uh-

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttt(Interrupting) 
ttHow do you like this couple, Max?

A couple moves over toward Rob and Alvy.  The man's arm is around the woman; 
they stand very close.  In the background, Annie and Tony are still talking.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttAnd I think they just came back from 
ttMasters and Johnson.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah, intensive care ward. 
ttt(Watching the woman in white) 
ttMy God-hey, Max, I think she's ... I 
ttthink she's giving me the eye. 

As Rob and Alvy observe the guests, the woman in white starts walking toward 
them.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttIf she comes over here, Max, my brain 
ttis going to turn into guacamole.

<b>ttttALVY
</b> tttI'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  Hi.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttOh.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttOh, he-he didn't say anything.

ttNo, no, I came out here to get some

ttHi.  How do you do.

<b>ttttGIRL IN WHITE 
</b>ttDo you taste to see if the food's poisoned?

<b>ttttALVY
</b> tttYeah, he's crazy.

The girl in white laughs.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b> tttt(Looking at Rob and the girl) 
ttHey, you guys are wearin' white. It must 
ttbe in the stars.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttYeah.  Right.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttUri Geller must be on the premises

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttWe're gonna operate together.

Rob and the girl walk of together as the camera moves in on Tony and Annie 
standing by the buffet table.

<b>ttttTONY 
</b>ttWe just need about six weeks, in about 
ttsix weeks we could cut a whole album.

ttI don't know.  I don't know.

She picks up an hors doeuvre.

The two men still talking about meetings surrounded by other groups of people 
milling about.

<b>tttt1ST MAN 
</b>ttNot only is he a great agent, but he 
ttreally gives good meetings.

<b>tttt2ND MAN   
</b>ttM'mm.

Tony, band in band with the girl in white, is leaving the party room with Alvy 
and Annie to show them the rest of the house.

<b>ttttTONY 
</b>ttThis is a great house, really.  Everything.  
ttSaunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.  
ttYou know who the original owners were?  
ttNelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond.  Then 
ttyou know who lived here?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttTrigger.

Annie and the girl in white laugh.

<b>ttttTONY 
</b>ttCharlie Chaplin.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttHey.

<b>ttttTONY 
</b>ttRight before his un-American thing.

They stop in a den-like screening room.  A man is slouched back on one of the 
comfortable sofas that fill the room.  It is much quieter in here; a contrast 
to the noise and crowd downstairs.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah, this place is great.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttTONY 
</b>ttUh, you guys are still-uh, you're still

ttThat's a great film if you're high.

tttat the man on the sofa. He looks 
tttup at them, smiling, a joint in 
ttthis hand, and offers them a cigarette) 
ttHey, you.

<b>ttttTONY 
</b>ttt(Shaking his head no) 
ttCome and see our bedroom.  We did a 
ttfantastic lighting job.  Okay?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttOh, good.  Okay.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI'm cool.

Tony and the girl in white leave the room, Annie and Alvy following.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Taking Alvy's arm) 
ttIt's wonderful. I mean, you know they 
ttjust watch movies all day.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah, and gradually you get old and die.  
ttYou know it's important to make a little 
tteffort once in a while.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttDon't you think his girl friend's 
ttbeautiful?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A 
ttpat on the androgynous side.  But it's...

They pass a man talking on the phone in the hallway.

<b>ttttMAN ON THE PHONE 
</b>ttYeah, yeah.  I forgot my mantra.

As they come down stairs the party is still in big gear.  People are looser 
now; conversations are more animated, some talk quietly in more intimate 
corners, some couples are dancing.  Alvy stands alone sipping a drink near the 
huge Christmas tree.  A tall woman, passing by, shakes his hand, then leaves. 
He continues to sip his drink, alone, watching Tony and Annie in the center of 
the room dancing.

The screen shows a plane in flight, Los Angeles far below, then:

Annie and Alvy sit, the stewardess behind them serving other passengers. Annie
stares out the window bolding a coffee cup; Alvy reads.  Both are preoccupied, 
thinking their own thoughts.

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
</b>ttIf only I didn't feel guilty asking 
ttAnnie to move out.  It'd probably 
ttwreck her.  But I should be honest.

He looks over at Annie.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Looking back at Alvy) 
ttAlvy, uh, let's face it.  You know 
ttsomething, don't think our relationship 
ttis working.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttTsch, I know.  A relationship, I think, 
ttis-is like a shark, you know?  It has 
ttto constantly move forward or it dies. 
ttt(He sighs) 
ttAnd I think what we got on our hands 
ttt(Clearing his throat) 
ttis a dead shark.

<b>INT. ALVY'S LIVING ROOM-DAY
</b>
A lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general 
disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie 
move out.

</b>ttt(Holding up a book) 
ttWhose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?

ttWell, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up 
ttjust as much as I do.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Riffling through the books) 
ttThere's no-no question in my mind.  I 
ttthink we're doing the mature thing, 
ttwithout any doubt.

<b>ttttANNIE

ttNow, look, all the books on death and

ttThis "Denial of Death".  You remember this?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttOh-

</b>ttThis is the first book that I got you.

Annie goes over to Alvy.  They both look down at the book; the fireplace, 
burning nicely, is behind them.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>tt-God.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttRemember that day?

way around the tables looking about.  He finally sits down at an empty table; 
nearby sits a woman with a younger man.  A waitress brings Alvy a menu and

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttHey, you didn't read "Death in Venice"
tttill I bought it for yuh.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttThat's right, that's right. 
ttt(Still smiling) 
ttYou only gave me books with the word 
tt"death" in the titles.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Nodding his head and gesturing) 
ttThat's right, 'cause it's an important 
ttissue.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttAlvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, 
ttyou know that?  I mean, your life is New 
ttYork City.  You're just this person.  
ttYou're like this island unto yourself.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Toying with his car keys) 
ttI can't enjoy anything unless I ... unless 
tteverybody is.  I-you know, if one guy is 
ttstarving someplace, that's ... you know, 
ttI-I ... it puts a crimp in my evening. 
ttt(Looking down at his hands, sadly) 
ttSo wanna get married or what?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Seriously) 
ttNo. We're friends.  I wanna remain friends.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(In disbelief) 
ttOkay. 
ttt(Louder, to the waitress) 
ttCheck, please.  Can I -can I ... 
ttCan I ... Can I ...

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Interrupting) 
ttYou're mad, aren't you?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Shaking his head) 
ttNo. 
ttt(Then nodding) 
ttYes, of course I'm mad, because you 
ttlove me, I know that.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttAlvy, I can't say that that's true at 
ttthis point in my life.  I really just 
ttcan't say that that's true.  I mean, 
ttyou know how wonderful you are.  I 
ttmean, you know ... you're the reason 
ttthat I got outta my room and that I 
ttwas able to sing, and-and-and, you know, 
ttget more in touch with my feelings and 
ttall that crap.  Anyway, look, I don't 
ttwanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh 
ttt(Laughing) 
tth'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttt(Shrugging his shoulders) 
ttThe usual, you know. Uh, tryin't'write. 
ttI'm workin' on a play. 
ttt(Sighing) 
ttJesus.  So whatta yuh saying?  That 
ttyou're not comin' back to New York with
ttme?

He nods his head in disbelief.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttt(Nodding) 
ttNo! 
ttt(Pauses) 
ttLook, I gotta go.

She starts to rise.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYou mean that ... 
ttt(He gets up and starts following 
ttther past diners at other tables) 
ttI-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to 
ttsee you.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttI'm late.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttAir miles, you know.  I mean, you 
ttknow what that does to my stomach?

They move down the steps of the cafe' toward the parking lot.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttIf you must know, it's a hectic time 
ttfor Tony.  The Grammys are tonight.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttThe what?

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttThe Grammys.  He's got a lotta records 
ttup for awards.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttYou mean they give awards for that 
ttkind o' music?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b> tttOh!

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttI thought just earplugs.

Annie gets into her car.  Alvy moves over to his rented convertible.

<b>ttttANNIE 
</b>ttJust forget it, Alvy, okay?  Let's 
ttjust forget the conversation.

She closes the door, starts the motor.

<b>ttttALVY
</b>ttt(Yelling after her) 
ttAwards! They do nothing but give out 
ttawards!  I can't believe it.  Greatest, 
ttgreatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler!  

Annie drives away. Alvy gets behind the wheel, starts the motor. Putting the 
car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with
a loud crash. Putting the car in reverse, Alvy notices a beige car that has 
just turned into the parking lot. For a brief moment, the screen shows a 
flashback of the bumper-car ride at the Brooklyn amusement park.  Alvy's father
is on the Platform directing traffic; young Alvy is in a small car bumping 
others right and left.  Alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible,
purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper-
car ride appears, this time-as, Alvy's father directs traffic-a Marine in a 
small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and Alvy, back in the parking 
lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force.

Another flashback appears. people in the small cars really racing around the 
track now, bumping into one another over and over again, Alvy's father 
directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where Alvy 
reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car.

He sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens 
start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop 
gets off beside Alvy's car and walks over to him.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Getting out of the car) 
ttOfficer, I know what you're gonna say.  
ttI'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, 
ttI-I have some problems with-with-with-

<b>ttttOFFICER 
</b>ttt(Interrupting) 
ttMay I see your license, please?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttSure. 
ttt(Searching, he finally fishes 
ttthis license out of his pocket) 
ttjust don't-don't get angry, you know 
ttwhat I mean?  'Cause I-I have - I have 
ttmy-my license here.  You know, it's a 
ttrented car.  And I've ...

He drops the license and it falls to the ground.

<b>ttttOFFICER
</b> tttDon't give me your life story 
ttt(Looking at the piece of paper 
ttton the ground)
tt-just pick up the license.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttPick up the license.  You have to ask 
ttnicely 'cause I've had an extremely 
ttrough day.  You know, my girl friend-

<b>ttttOFFICER 
</b>ttt(Interrupting) 
ttJust give me the license, please.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttSince you put it that way. 
ttt(He laughs) 
ttIt's hard for me to refuse. 
ttt(He leans over, picks up the 
tttlicense, then proceeds to rip 
tttit up.  He lets the pieces go; 
tttthey float to the ground)
tt... have a, I have a terrific problem 
ttwith authority, you know.  I'm... it's 
ttnot your fault.  Don't take it personal.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. JAIL-CELLS CORRIDOR.
</b>
A guard moves down the ball to the cell where, Alvy stands with other inmates.
He unlocks the door and opens it, letting Alvy out.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttSo long, fellas.  Keep in touch. 

He walks down the corridor off screen.

<b>EXT. A STREET IN FRONT OF THE COURT HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Policemen are walking up and down the courthouse steps as Alvy and Rob move 
out the door of the building, down the steps to the street.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttImagine my surprise when I got your 
ttcall, Max.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Carrying his jacket over his 
tttshoulder) 
ttYeah.  I had the feeling that I got 
ttyou at a bad moment.  You know, I heard 
tthigh-pitched squealing.

They walk over to Rob's convertible and get in.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttt(Starting the car) 
ttTwins, Max.  Sixteen-year-olds.  Can you 
ttimagine the mathematical possibilities?

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Reacting) 
ttYou're an actor, Max.  You should be 
ttdoing Shakespeare in the Park.

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttOh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max.  
ttI got mugged.  I was playing Richard the 
ttSecond and two guys with leather jackets 
ttstole my leotard.

He puts on an elaborate helmet and goggles.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(Looking at Rob's helmet) 
ttMax, are we driving through plutonium?

<b>ttttROB 
</b>ttKeeps out the alpha rays, Max.  You 
ttdon't get old.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. REHEARSAL HALL OF A THEATER.
</b>
An actor and actress sit on hard wooden chairs in a sparse rehearsal ball.  
They face each other.  The actress resembles Annie; the actor, Alvy.

<b>ttttACTOR 
</b>ttYou're a thinking person.  How can you 
ttchoose this lifestyle?

<b>ttttACTRESS 
</b>ttWhat is so incredibly great about New 
ttYork?  It's a dying city!  You-you read 
tt"Death in Venice".

<b>ttttACTOR 
</b>ttYou didn't read "Death in Venice" till 
ttI gave it to you!

<b>ttttACTRESS 
</b>ttWell, you only give me books with the 
ttword "death" in the title.

The camera pulls back, showing Alvy sitting with two men at a table set up 
near the actors.  A mirror, running the whole width of the wall, reflects the 
two actors, a script lying on the table between them.  It is obvious now that 
they are rehearsing a scene that Alvy wrote.

<b>ttttACTOR 
</b>ttt(In mirrored reflection) 
ttIt's an important issue.

<b>ttttACTRESS 
</b>ttt(In mirrored reflection) 
ttAlvy, you are totally incapable of 
ttenjoying life.

The camera moves back to actual actor and actress.

<b>ttttACTRESS 
</b>ttYou're like New York.  You're an island.

<b>ttttACTOR 
</b>ttt(Rising with emotion) 
ttOkay, if that's all that we've been 
ttthrough together means to you, I guess 
ttit's better if we just said goodbye, 
ttonce and for all!  You know, it's funny, 
ttafter all the serious talks and passionate 
ttmoments that it ends here ... in a health
tt-food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.  
ttGoodbye, Sunny.

The actor begins to leave as the actress jumps up from her chair.

<b>ttttACTRESS 
</b>ttWait!  I'm-I'm gonna ... go with you. 
ttt(The actor comes back. They embrace) 
ttI love you.

The camera cuts to Alvy, who turns and looks straight into the camera.

<b>ttttALVY 
</b>ttt(To the audience, gesturing) 
ttTsch, whatta you want?  It was my first 
ttplay.  You know, you know how you're 
ttalways tryin' t' get things to come out 
ttperfect in art because, uh, it's real 
ttdifficult in life.  Interestingly, however, 
ttI did run into Annie again.  It was on the 
ttUpper West Side of Manhattan.

Annie, singing "Seems Like Old Times, " overlaps Alvy's speech and continues 
over the next scene, where Alvy, standing in front of a Manhattan theater, 
shakes hands with Annie and her escort.  The theater marquee reads "OPHULS 
<b>PRIZE FILM: 'THE SORROW AND THE PITY'."
</b>
<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE
</b>ttt(Over the theater scene and, 
tttAnnie's singing) 
ttShe had moved back to New York.  She was 
ttliving in SoHo with some guy. 
ttt(Laughing) 
ttAnd when I met her she was, of all things, 
ttdragging him in to see "The Sorrow and the 
ttPity."  Which I counted as a personal 
tttriumph.  Annie and I ... 
ttt(Alvy's voice continues over the 
tttscene shot through a window of 
tttManhattan cafe showing Alvy and 
tttAnnie sitting at a table, laughing 
tttand enjoying themselves) 
tt... we had lunch sometime after that, and, 
ttuh, just, uh, kicked around old times.

A series of flashbacks following in quick succession while Annie continues to 
sing:

Annie and Alvy going up the FDR Drive, the day they met playing tennis, Annie 
driving, Alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich.

Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen, Annie banding a live lobster to 
Alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove.

Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline.

Alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and 
sees Annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home 
in her car.

Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; Annie
and, Alvy in the bookstore buying the "Death" titles; Annie and, Alvy in 
their Hamptons house, Annie reading a school catalogue, the night Alvy puts 
in the red light.

The memories continue to flash on the screen: Annie and Alvy at a friend's 
house, Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; Annie and Alvy playing 
tennis; Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college 
performance in Annie's hometown; Alvy bolding Annie close, the night he came 
over to kill the spider.

And continue: Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvy's bedroom, Alvy 
following, the day she first moved into his apartment.  Annie holding up her 
sexy birthday present from Alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; Annie and 
Alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park
bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the FDR Drive, the New York City 
skyline behind them.
The music stops.

Returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows 
Annie and Alvy across street.  They look about at the city traffic.  Lunch is 
over; it's time.

Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like.  Annie crosses 
the street, Alvy watching her go.  Then he turns, and slowly walks down the 
street off screen.  His voice is heard over the scene:

<b>ttttALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
</b>ttAfter that it got pretty late.  And we 
ttboth hadda go, but it was great seeing 
ttAnnie again, right?  I realized what a 
ttterrific person she was and-and how much 
ttfun it was just knowing her and I-I 
ttthought of that old joke, you know, this-
ttthis-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and 
ttsays, "Doc, uh, my brother's crazy.  He 
ttthinks he's a chicken." And, uh, the 
ttdoctor says, "Well, why don't you turn 
tthim in?" And the guy says, "I would, but 
ttI need the eggs." Well, I guess that's 
ttpretty much how how I feet about 
ttrelationships.  You know, they're totally 
ttirrational and crazy and absurd and ... 
ttbut, uh, I guess we keep goin' through it 
ttbecause, uh, most of us need the eggs.
