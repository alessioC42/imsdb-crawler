<b>tFADE IN:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT. A MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tA few patients sit around fumbling with themselves. One man
tsits at a table scratching back and forth on a piece of paper
twith a crayon. Another stands in a corner smoking a cigarette
tand staring at the crayon guy. This is CHARLES. Another man,
tKARL, sits in a chair staring at the floor and rubbing his
thands together. We cut back and forth between Charles staring
tand Crayon Man scratching. After a moment, an attendant
tapproaches Charles.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ATTENDANT 
</b>t          You can't smoke in here.
<b>t
</b>tCharles stares at him blankly for a moment and continues
tsmoking. He looks back to Crayon Man again for a moment then
tlooks over at Karl and then goes and sits down beside him.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    CHARLES 
</b>t          A Mercury is a good car and that's
t          what I was driving that day. I've
t          owned a lot of cars. Different
t          kinds. Lots of different kinds of
t          cars. She was standing, this girl,
t          on the side of the street where
t          there was a chicken stand; not the
t          Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless
t          a chicken stand, and I pulled the
t          Mercury over and rolled down the
t          window by electric power. She was
t          wearing a leather skirt and she had
t          a lot of hair on her arms. I like
t          that. I like it a lot. It means a
t          big bush. I like a big bush. She
t          said, "Are you dating?" I said,
t          "yes," and she got in the car. We
t          pulled to a remote location, one
t          that she and I both felt
t          comfortable with and she said, "How
t          much can you spend?" I said, "What
t          it takes to see your bush. I know
t          it's a big one." She said "twenty
t          five dollars," which to a working
t          man is not chicken feed. I produced
t          the money and she put it in her
t          shoe and pulled up her skirt. There
t          before me lay a thin, crooked,
t          uncircumcised penis. You can
t          imagine how badly I wanted my
t          twenty-five dollars back.

</b><b>tINT. A HALLWAY - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tTwo young women, MARSHA DWIGGINS, carrying a briefcase, and
tTHERESA EVANS, carrying two camera bags are being led down
tthe hallway by a GUARD.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    THERESA 
</b>t          I don't know why you're so weirded
t          out, this is not San Quentin, it's

</b><b>t                    MARSHA 
</b>t          In a few minutes we're gonna be in

</b>t          Hey, you're the one that wanted to
t          major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't
t          the guy something like twelve or
t          thirteen when he did it, it was
t          twenty-five years ago, he probably
t          doesn't even remember it.

</b><b>t
</b>tJERRY WOOLRIDGE stands up from behind the desk as they enter.
tHe's in his fifiles and looks like a school teacher, shop
tclass or perhaps eighth-grade science.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    GUARD
</b>t          These are the people from that

<b>t
</b><b>t                    WOOLRIDGE

<b>t

</b>t          Yes sir.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    WOOLRIDGE
</b>t          I think there must have been a
t          little mix up. I told your sponsor
t          or teacher or whatever he is, there
t          couldn't be any pictures. It's
t          s'posed to be just a little story
t          or article or something, isn't that
t          right?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MARSHA
</b>t          Well, yeah, it's for the school
t          newspaper. But it has pictures. I
t          mean it's a regular paper, you
t          know. 
<b>t
</b><b>t                    WOOLRIDGE
</b>t          Karl's real sensitive about having
t          his picture made. He wouldn't even
t          be on the bulletin board for the
t          Easter Collage. 
t              (to guard) 
t          Melvin, would you get me a good hot
t          cup with two sugar substitutes? You
t          girls want some coffee?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MARSHA 
</b>t          No thank you.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    WOOLRIDGE 
</b>t          The other thing is I told your boss
t          on the phone to send a man. Karl
t          won't talk to women.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. REC ROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tCLOSE UP on Karl's face. Charles has started another
tmonologue.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    CHARLES 
</b>t          There was a young man named John
t          Liggit Hunter who was in the
t          filling station business and a good
t          filling station business. He was
t          one of those young men that we run
t          across so often in life. I'm sure
t          you've run across them, that didn't
t          deserve the things he had. One of
t          those things was his beautiful
t          bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia
t          Peach. As a matter of fact she
t          looked more like the picture I've
t          had in my head than any woman I've
t          ever seen. I took it upon myself to
t          take her away from John Liggit
t          Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm
t          not sure if I mentioned that he was
t          a Frenchman who claimed to be an
t          Englishman. It took some very
t          strong nylon cord to take her away
t          from him. She was a fighter as well
t          as a Georgia Peach.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. WOOLRIDGE'S OFFICE

</b>tThe girls look confused.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    WOOLRIDGE 
</b>t          I don't know what to tell you. I'm
t          sorry. I made myself pretty clear I
t          thought. He probably got busy and
t          wasn't thinking. I know how that
t          is. I used to teach shop and eighth
t          grade science.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MARSHA 
</b>t          Well, what do we do? We drove all
t          the way out here.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    THERESA 
</b>t          Let's just go, Marsha.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MARSHA 
</b>t          No, we have to get this story.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    THERESA 
</b>t          I thought you'd be happy to leave.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MARSHA 
</b>t          Why won't he talk to women?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    WOOLRIDGE 
</b>t          He has problems. You know. With all
t          that. He won't hardly talk to
t          anybody really. Just certain

</b>t              (takes a drink of coffee)
t          I don't think he's talked to a
t          woman in twenty-five or so years.
t          That I know of anyway. That's why I
t          said to send a man. At least maybe
t          he'd answer a question or two for a
t          man. I'm all for helping the
t          college out, believe me. It might
t          be a real good article or story.
<b>t

<b>t

</b>t          You see, Karl, growing up, only
t          knew that sex was wrong and that
t          people who did it should be killed
t          for it. He couldn't really read
t          but, well, neither could his
t          mother. But, his father made sure
t          that his mother knew what the Bible
t          said. And she made sure Karl knew.
t          You know he slept in a hole in the

<b>t
</b><b>t                    MARSHA

<b>t
</b><b>t                    WOOLRIDGE
</b>t          His mother told him that he was

<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t                    WOOLRIDGE 
</b>t          I don't think so. Just period, I
t          think. She told him... God gave
t          them the ugliest creation he could
t          think of. Karl has an entire book --
t          a notebook. On every page it says
t          "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number
t          1." He wrote that a few years ago
t          after he'd learned to write. His
t          father's name was Franklin.
<b>t

t          most of his life, not that I can
t          say the same fer myself. I most
t          just set around the shed and
t          tinkered around with a lawn mower
t          or two and went to school off and
t          on from time to time but the
t          children there made quite a bit of
t          sport of me, made fun of me quite a
t          bit. Some of 'em roughed me up
t          sometimes so mostly I stayed out
t          back there in the shed. My daddy
t          worked down at the sawmill there,
t          down there at the planer mill for
t          an old man named Dixon.
t          Old man Dixon was a very cruel
t          feller, he didn't treat his
t          employees very well, didn't pay 'em
t          much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy
t          much of a wage, just barely enough
t          to get by on. But I reckon he got
t          by all right, they come out one or
t          the other of 'em, usually my
t          mother, and fed me pretty regular.
t          At least I know he made enough for
t          me to have mustard and biscuits
t          three or four times a week. Old man
t          Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.
t          Jesse was really more cruel than
t          his daddy. He made quite a bit of
t          sport of me and takened advantage
t          of the little girls around the
t          neighborhood quite a bit. 
t              (pause)
t          He used to say my mother was a very
t          pretty woman. He said it quite a
t          bit from time to time, when I was
t          at the school house. Well, I reckon
t          you want me to get on and tell you
t          what happened so I reckon I'll tell
t          you. I was settin' out in the shed
t          one evenin' not doin' too much,
t          just kindly starin' at the wall and
t          a waitin' fer my mother to come out
t          and give me my Bible lesson and I
t          heared a commotion up in the house
t          there so I got up and run up on the
t          screened-in porch there to see what
t          was a goin' on, and I looked in the
t          kitchen window and I seen my mother
t          a layin' there on the floor without
t          any clothes on. 
t              (pause, breathing)
t          And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on
t          top of her having his way with her. 
t              (pause)
t          Well, I just seen red. I picked up
t          a kaiser blade that was a layin'
t          there by the screen door, some
t          folks calls it a sling blade, I
t          call it a kaiser blade. It's just a
t          long handle like a axe handle with
t          a long blade on it that's shaped
t          kind of like a banana. Sharp on one
t          edge and dull on the other. It's
t          what the highway boys use to cut
t          down weeds and whatnot.
t          I went in the kitchen there and I
t          hit Jesse Dixon up side the head
t          with it and knocked him off my
t          mother. I reckon that didn't quite
t          satisfy me so I hit him again in
t          the neck with the sharp edge and
t          just plumb near cut his head off.
t          Killed him. Well, my mother, she
t          jumped up from there and started
t          yellin', "What did you kill Jesse
t          fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?"
t              (pause, intense breathing)
t          Well, come to find out my mother
t          didn't really mind what Jesse was a
t          doin' to her. I reckon that made me
t          madder than what Jesse had made me.
t          I takened the kaiser blade, some
t          folks calls it a sling blade, I
t          call it a kaiser blade and hit my
t          mother up side the head with it an'
t          killed her.
t              (long pause, breathing)
t          Some folks has asked me if I had it
t          to do over again would I do the
t          same thing. I don't know, I reckon
t          I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to
t          put me in here and here I've been
t          for a great long while. I've
t          learned to read some; took me four
t          years to read the Bible. I reckon I
t          understand a good deal of it. It
t          wasn't what I expected in a lot of
t          places. I've slept in a good bed
t          for a great long while. They've
t          seen fit to put me out now. They
t          tell me they're a settin' me free
t          today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all
t          you need to know. If you want any
t          more details I reckon I can tell
t          'em to you. I don't know if that's
t          enough for your newspaper or not.

tFrank's mother in her red smock talking to a guy in a red
tBen's knit shirt. They are laughing together and pricing some
tmouthwash. LINDA WHEATLEY is a short, plain woman in her
tthirties. The man, VAUGHAN CUNNINGHAM, is in his forties,
twith a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hanging

t          'cause I come out here when I feel
t          like bein' by myself. I used to
t          come here with Karen Cross. She's
t          kind of like my girlfriend, or used
t          to be. She says she likes Jerry
t          Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her
t          back 'cause I love her. We used to
t          come here and hold hands and talk
t          and read books to each other with a
t          flashlight. She didn't want to have
t          anything to do with me in front of
t          other people 'cause I don't have
t          any money. Well, mama and me, I

t          She said she loved me, too. Out

t          You're just a boy.

</b><b>t                    FRANK 
</b>t          I've had a lot of bad thoughts

t          wish I was still real little and he
t          was still here. My mama's real
t          good, but I wish I had both of 'em.

t          daddy was drivin' nothin' could
t          happen to us. I feel that way about
t          mama now. 
t              (he looks at the ground
t               for a moment)
t          Mama has a boyfriend now. His name
t          is Doyle Hargraves. He works
t          construction so he makes a pretty
t          good livin'. He still don't help
t          mama out with any money though. He
t          ain't no good. He's mean to her. He
t          don't like me at all. Mama says
t          it's because he's jealous I belong
t          to my daddy instead of him. He
t          stays with us all night sometimes,
t          but he's got his own house.
t          Somebody told me it's so he can
t          still have other girlfriends. I
t          like it on the nights when he ain't
t          at our house. I'm not so nervous

<b>t

t          since daddy died. She said
t          sometimes she don't know why. 
t              (pause)
t          He threatened to kill her if she
t          ever left him. My daddy would kill
t          him if he was here and somebody was
t          mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real
t          good to mama. Vaughan that you met.
t          But he's not able to do anything to
t          Doyle, he's funny you know. Not
t          funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes
t          to go with men instead of women.
t          That makes him not to be able to
t          fight too good. He sure is nice
t          though. He's from St. Louis. People
t          who are queer can get along better
t          in a big town. He got transferred
t          here to work. But mama said the
t          real reason he left is 'cause his
t          daddy hated him. For bein' the way
t          he is. I wish he liked to go with

t          I guess I'll put it right out on
t          the table. Where do I start. Linda
t          and Frank are very important to me.
t          They're like family. My own family
t          was never like family. They're
t          horrible people. As a matter of
t          fact I prayed every night for years
t          that my father would die. I finally
t          realized through a lot of therapy
t          that I was wasting my energy on
t          hating him. Now I just don't care. 
t              (pause)
t          You see, you and I are a lot alike,
t          strange as that may seem. I mean
t          not physically or even mentally
t          really, just well, maybe
t          emotionally or actually the hand
t          we've been dealt in life. We're
t          different. People see us as being

t          you have your affliction or
t          whatever and I, well mine's not as
t          easy to see. I'm just going to say
t          it. I'm gay.

</b>t          Anyway, it's hard to live gay,
t          that's the right way to say it, in
t          a small town like this. I've wanted
t          to leave many times, but my love
t          for Linda and Frank and another
t          certain person that we won't go
t          into have kept me from it. Anyway,
t          I'm rambling. If you're going to
t          live in the Wheatly garage you need
t          to know that it won't be easy.
t          Doyle is a monster. Not just a
t          closed minded redneck, but a
t          monster. A dangerous person. I've
t          told Linda that one day that man is
t          going to really hurt her or that
t          boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I
t          see it in his eyes. I'm very in
t          tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle
t          will make your life hell. You're a
t          perfect target. When I first saw
t          you I was afraid of you. Not really
t          afraid, I guess, just taken aback.
t          But also, I felt a real sensitive
t          feeling from you. And for some
t          reason, Frank has adopted you. Much
t          like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I
t          didn't mean it like that. In a good
t          way. Anyway, I just want you to
t          know what you're in for. I have a
t          good feeling about you. You're good
t          for Frank. Maybe it's that he can
t          have an adult friend on a child's
t          level.
t          I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a
t          bad way.
t              (pause)
t          There's one more thing. It's none
t          of my business why you were in the
t          state hospital. Everyone has
t          something in their past, maybe you
t          tried suicide, maybe you did
t          something -- terrible. But what I
t          see before me is a gentle, simple
t          man. All I want you to promise me
t          is that you're capable of being
t          around Linda and Frank. You know.
t          You would never hurt them under any
t          circumstances, would you?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    KARL 
</b>t          I wouldn't never hurt them.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    VAUGHAN 
</b>t          That's what I thought. I hope I
t          haven't offended you in any way.
t          You seem like a thinker. You seem
t          to always be in deep thought. Tell
t          me something. What are you thinking
t          right now?

</b><b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tDoyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle.
tTerence and Morris are sitting facing Karl and Vaughan who
tare on the sofa. Randy and The Johnson are sitting across the
troom in straight-backed chairs drinking beer. They really
tstocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are
tstrewn everywhere. Morris is in the middle of a monologue,
twhich has obviously been going on for awhile.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MORRIS 
</b>t          Anyhow I'm not sure if you follow
t          me on those particular points, but
t          it's not really important in the
t          smaller picture, which is where
t          most people dwell anyway. Not that
t          being manager of Ben's Dollar Store
t          is insignificant. Or that making it
t          through years of incarceration in a
t          state supported facility is any
t          small feat.

</b>t          Morris is real smart with
t          philosophies and things. That's why
t          him and me are the songwriting team
t          of our group. I make up good tunes
t          or melodies as we call them and
t          Morris is the lyrics.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MORRIS
</b>t          Not unlike Gary Brooker of the

</b>t          We don't ever play any songs that

</b>t          We don't even play any songs with

<b>t
</b><b>t                    TERENCE
</b>t          We wrote one last night standin'
t          outside Mini-Mart. Morris called it
t          "Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."
t          Then, you know, like on country
t          songs in parenthesis it says "There

</b><b>t                    DOYLE
</b>t          See Vaughan, you shouldn't question

<b>t
</b><b>t                    MORRIS 
</b>t          Our latest composition is as

t          Not for a thrill

t          of a fresh kill 
t          Never mind the man 
t          who contemplates 
t          doing away with license plates 
t          He stands alone anyway 
t          Baking the cookies of discontent 
t          By the heat of a laundrymat vent
t          Leaving his soul" 
t          (Then like in poetry I have dot dot
t          dot then drop down to the next line

<b>t

tsomething other than Morris.
<b>t

t          so we could talk. I guess you'd say

</b>t          I know you could of scored them

</b><b>tINT. GARAGE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tKarl sits on his bed rubbing his hands together, deep in
tthought.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. STREET - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tKarl is walking down the street past rundown houses. He comes
tto an old gray woodframe house. It is in bad repair, the
tpaint is peeling, the yard is grown up. There is an old
twooden shed in the back yard. He stands looking at it for a
tmoment then walks through the yard and opens the door to the
tshed. He's motionless for a moment, then goes inside.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. SHED - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tSunlight comes through the cracks in the wood. The shed has
tnothing but dirt for a floor. A few tall patches of grass
tshoot up between boxes and rusty lawnmowers. A few old garden
ttools hang on the wall. In the center is a low circular spot
tin the ground and a few tattered shreds of an old quilt.
tKarl stands looking at the hole for a moment, then turns and
twalks out of the shed.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. YARD - DAY

</b><b>t
</b>tKarl goes onto the screened-in porch, looks through the
tkitchen window and goes inside.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tThe place is a mess. Dirty dishes are piled in the sink and
ton the table. It's not just clutter, but filth everywhere.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tKarl walks into an equally filthy living room where an OLD
tMAN in overalls sits slumped in a chair looking at his lap.
tKarl stands facing him for several moments.

</b><b>t                    OLD MAN 
</b>t          I told you, I ain't got no boy, now

<b>t
</b>tLong silence.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    KARL 
</b>t          I learned to read some. I've read
t          on the Bible quite a bit. I don't

t              (Karl walks toward the
t               kitchen and turns back to
t               the old man)
t          You ort not to of killed my

<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. YARD
</b><b>t
</b>tKarl walks out of the house and across the yard to a hedge in
tthe corner and kneels down. He pushes some grass aside to
treveal a rock about afoot tall and afoot across. In front of
tit, the ground is raised a little. He stares at the rock for
ta moment and touches it.

</b>tAll the lights are out. We see a shot of Frank in his bed
tasleep, but tossing and turning. Then a shot of Linda in bed
tstaring at the ceiling and Doyle beside her snoring.
tSuddenly, the lights come on and Linda lets out a little yelp
tand sits up, which wakes up Doyle and he sits up with a
