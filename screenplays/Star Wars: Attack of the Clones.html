A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.

ttttThere is unrest in the Galactic Senate
ttttSeveral hundred solar systems under
ttttthe leadership of the rebel leader, Count
ttttDooku, have decalred their intentions to
ttttsecede from the Republic.

ttttThis separatist movement has made it
ttttdifficult for the limited number of
ttttJedi Kights to maintain peace and
ttttorder in the galaxy.

ttttSenator Amidala, the former Queen of
ttttNaboo, is returning to Coruscant
ttttto vote on the critical issue
ttttof creating an army to assist the
ttttoverwhelmed Jedi.

PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.

<b>EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
</b>The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.

<b>EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
</b>Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.

A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.

One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.

<b>CAPTAIN TYPHO
</b>We made it. I guess I was wrong,
there was no danger at all.

The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.

The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.

Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.

<b>ttttPADMxc9 
</b>tttCordxe9...

She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cordxe9's eyes are open. She looks up at her.

<b>ttttCORDxc9
</b>ttt... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... 

CORDxc9 dies. PADMxc9 hugs her.

<b>ttttAMIDALA
</b>tttNo!... No!... No!...

PADMxc9 lowers CORDxc9 to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.

<b>ttttAMIDALA
</b>tttI should not have come back.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN TYPHO
</b>tttM'Lady, you are still in danger.

Amidala says nothing.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN TYPHO
</b>tttThis vote is very important. You did
tttyour duty and Cordxe9 did hers. Now
tttcome. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
tttplease!

She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.

<b>EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY 
</b>The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.

<b>INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
</b>The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.

<b>ttttMAS AMEDDA
</b>tttOrder! We shall have order! The motion
tttfor the Republic to commission an army
ttttakes precedent, and that is what we
tttwill vote on at this time.

Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>ttt...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
tttme... I have just received some
ttttragic and disturbing news. Senator
tttAmidala of the Naboo system... Has
tttbeen assassinated!

There is a shock silence in the vast arena.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttt(continued)
tttThis grievous blow is especially
tttpersonal to me. Before I became
tttChancellor, I served Amidala when
tttshe was Queen. She was a great
tttleader who fought for justice, not
tttonly in this honourable assembly,
tttbut also on her home planet. She
tttwas so loved she could have been
tttelected queen for life. She
tttbelieved in public service, and
tttshe fervently believed in
tttdemocracy. Her death is a great
tttloss to us all. We will all mourn
ttther as a relentless champion of
tttfreedom... and as a dear friend.

There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.

<b>ttttSENATOR ASK AAK
</b>tttHow many more Senators will die
tttbefore this civil strife ends! We
tttmust confront these rebels now,
tttand they need an army to do it.

A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the 
<b>AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.
</b>
<b>ttttAMBASSADOR DARSANA
</b>tttWhy weren't the Jedi able to stop
tttthis assassination? We are no
tttlonger safe, under their protection.

Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.

<b>ttttORN FREE TAA
</b>tttThe Republic needs more security
tttnow! Before it comes to war.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttMust I remind the Senator from
tttMalastare that negotiations are
tttcontinuing with the separatists.
tttPeace is our objective here... not
tttwar.

The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.

<b>ttttAMIDALA
</b>tttMy noble colleagues, I concur with
tttthe Supreme Chancellor. At all
tttcosts, we do not want war!

The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and 
applause.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttIt is with great surprise and
tttjoy the chair recognises the
tttSenator from Naboo, Padmxe9 Amidala.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttLess than an hour ago, an
tttassassination attempt was made
tttagainst my life. One of my
tttbodyguards and six  others were
tttruthlessly and senselessly
tttmurdered. I was the target but,
tttmore importantly, I believe this
tttsecurity measure before you, was
tttthe target. I have led the
tttopposition to build an army... but
tttthere is someone in this body who
tttwill stop at nothing to assure it's
tttpassage...

Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>ttt t(continuing)
tttI warn you, if you vote to create
tttthis army, war will follow. I
ttthave experienced the misery of war 
tttfirst-hand; I do not wish to do it
tttagain.

There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttWake up, Senators... you must wake
tttup! If you offer the separatists
tttviolence, they can only show us
tttviolence in return! Many will
tttlose their lives. All will lose
ttttheir freedom. This decision
tttcould very well destroy the very
tttfoundation of our great Republic.
tttI pray you do not let fear push
tttyou into a disastrous decision.
tttVote down this security measure,
tttwhich is nothing less than a
tttdeclaration of war! Does anyone
ttthere want that? I cannot believe
tttthey do.

There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.

<b>ttttORN FREE TAA
</b>tttMy motion to defer the vote must
tttbe dealt with first. That is the
tttrule of law.

AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttDue to the lateness of the hour
tttand the seriousness of this
tttmotion, we will take up these
tttmatters tomorrow. Until then, the
tttSenate stands adjourned.

<b>EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY 
</b>The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.

<b>INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
</b>CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from him.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttI don't know how much longer I can
ttthold off the vote, my friends.
tttMore and more star systems are
tttjoining the separatists.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttIf they do break away -

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttNo! I will not let that happen!

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttBut if they do, you must realise
tttthere aren't enough Jedi to
tttprotect the Republic. We are
tttkeepers of the peace, not soldiers.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttMaster Yoda, do you think it will
tttreally come to war?

YODA closes his eyes.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttWorse than war, I fear... Much
tttworse. 

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttWhat?

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttWhat do you sense, Master?

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttImpossible to see ... The Dark Side
tttclouds everything. But this I am
tttsure of -
tttt(opens his eyes)
tttDo their duty the Jedi will.

A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.

<b>ttttDAR WAC
</b>tttThe loyalist committee has arrived,
tttmy Lord. 

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttSend them in.

They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttWith you the force is strong...
tttyoung Senator. To see you alive
tttbrings warm feeling to my heart.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttThank you, Master Yoda. Do you
ttthave any idea who was behind
tttthe attack?

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttOur intelligence points to
tttdisgruntled spice miners, on
tttthe moons of Naboo.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI don't wish to disagree but I
tttthink that Count Dooku was behind
tttit.

There is a stir of surprise.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttYou know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
tttwas once a Jedi. He wouldn't
tttassassinate anyone, it is not in
ttthis character.

<b>ttttKI-ADI-MUNDI
</b>tttHe is a political idealist, not
ttta murderer.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttIn dark times nothing is what it
tttappears to be, but the fact remains
tttSenator, in grave danger you are.

PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttCount Dooku has always avoided
tttany kind of conflict. It appears
ttthe has no desire to start a war.
tttWhy would he kill you? To what end?

<b>ttttPADMxc9 
</b>tttI don't know, but everything in my
tttbeing tells me he was behind it... 

After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to 
Mace.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttMaster Jedi, may I suggest that
tttthe Senator be placed under the
tttprotection of your graces.

<b>ttttBAIL ORGANA
</b>tttDo you think that is a wise use
tttof manpower during these stressful
ttttimes?

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttChancellor, if I may comment, I
tttdo not believe the...

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>ttt..."situation is that serious."
tttNo, but I do, Senator.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttChancellor, please! I don't want
tttany more guards!

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttI realise all too well that
tttadditional security might be
tttdisruptive for you, but perhaps
tttsomeone you are familiar with... an
tttold friend like... Master Kenobi...

PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttThat's possible. He has just
tttreturned from a Border dispute on
tttAnsion.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttYou must remember him, M'Lady...
ttthe watched over you during the
tttblockade conflict.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttThis is not necessary, Chancellor.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttDo it for me, M'Lady, please. I
tttwill rest easier. We had a big
tttscare today. The thought of
tttlosing you is unbearable.

AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttI will have Obi-Wan report to you
tttimmediately, M'Lady.

YODA leans into her ear.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttToo little about yourself you
tttworry, Senator, and too much about
tttpolitics. Be mindful of your
tttdanger, Padmxe9. Accept our help.

As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttI will not like this Republiv, that
ttthas stood for over a thousand
tttyears, be split in two

<b>EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT
</b>A graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.

<b>INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING
</b>The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand.

<b>ttttJAR JAR
</b>tttObi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen

tttExcuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I

JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.

<b>ttttJAR JAR
</b>tttAnnie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!

<b>INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING
</b>PADME is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI.

<b>ttttJAR JAR
</b>tttLookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
tttdear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
tttmyself again.

PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttIt's a great pleasure to see you again,

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttIt has been far too long Master
tttKenobi. I'm so glad our paths

</b>tttI'm sure the Jedi Council have

She moves in front of ANAKIN

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttAnnie??
tttt(stares)
tttMy goodness you've grown.

They look at each other for a long moment.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(trying to be smooth)
tttSo have you... grown more
tttbeautiful, I mean... and much
tttshorter... for a Senator, I mean.

OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttOh Annie, you'll always be that
tttlittle boy I knew on Tatooine.

This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttOur presence will be invisible,
tttM'Lady.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN TYPHO
</b>tttI am very grateful you are here,

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI don't need more security, I need

tttWe're here to protect you
tttSenator, not to start an
tttinvestigation.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWe will find out who is trying to
tttkill you Padmxe9, I promise you.

He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWe are not going to exceed our
tttmandate, my young Padawan learner.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI meant in the interest of

</b>tttWe are not going through this

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWhy?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhat??!!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWhy else do you think we were
tttassigned to her, if not to find

tttfor local security... not Jedi.
tttIt's overkill, Master.
tttInvestigation is implied in our

There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.

<b>INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off.

<b>INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT
</b>ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.

The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttCaptain Typho has more than enough

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttQuiet as a tomb. I don't like

OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhat's going on?

ANAKIN shrugs.

</b>tttShe covered that camera. I don't

<b>INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.

ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.

<b>ttttANAKIN 
</b>tttShe's not like the others in the

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttIt's been my experience that
tttSenators are only focused on

tttcampaigns... and they are more
tttthan willing to forget the

tttfunds.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttNot another lecture, Master. Not

tttIt's too early in the morning... and

</b>ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.


OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.

<b>EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.

<b>INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.

<b>EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
</b>The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. 

<b>EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</b>ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.

<b>EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
</b>The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttI have a bad feeling about this.

FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttThat was wacky! I almost lost you
tttin the traffic.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhat took you so long?

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttOh, you know, Master, I couldn't
tttfind a speeder I really liked,
tttwith an open cockpit... and with
tttthe right speed capabilities...
tttand then you know I had to get a
tttreally gonzo color...

They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttIf you'd spend as much time
tttworking on your saber skills as
tttyou do on your wit, young Padawan,
tttyou would rival Master Yoda as a
tttswordsman.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI thought I already did.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttOnly in your mind, my very young
tttapprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!

As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttSorry, I forgot you don't like
tttflying, Master.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttI don't mind flying... but
tttwhat you're doing is suicide!

They barely miss a commuter train

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttMaster, you know I've been flying
tttsince before I could walk. I'm very
tttgood at this.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttJust slow down!

ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttWait! Don't go in there!

ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttYou know I don't like it when you
tttdo that!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttSorry, Master. Don't worry, this
tttguy's gonna kill himself any
tttminute now!

ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhat are you doing? He's gonna
tttblast me!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttRight - this isn't working.

ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttThat was too close!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttClear that!

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhat??

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttClear the flag! We're losing
tttpower! Hurry!

OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhooooaaa! Don't do that! I
tttdon't  like it when you do that!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttSo sorry, Master.

They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttIt's dangerous near those power
tttcouplings! Slow down! Don't go
tttthrough there!

Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttYiiii, what are you doing?

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttSorry, Master!

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(sarcastically)
tttOh, that was good...

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttThat was crazy!!!

ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttAhh, damn.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttStop!!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttNo, we can make it.

ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttI'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
tttcrazy.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttBut it worked... we made it.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(angrily)
tttIt didn't work... we've stalled!
tttAnd you almost got us killed!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI think we're still alive.

ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(very angrily)
tttIt was stupid!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(sheepishly)
tttI could have made it...

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(furious)
tttBut you didn't!!! And now we've
tttlost him.

Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttNo we didnx92t...

Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhere are you going?! He went
tttdown there, the other way.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttThis is a shortcut... I think.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhat do you mean, x91You think?x92
tttWhat kind of shortcut?! He went
tttcompletely the other way! Youx92ve
tttlost him!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttMaster, if we keep this chase
tttgoing, that creepx92s gonna end up
tttdeep fried. Personally, Ix92d very
tttmuch like to find out who in the
ttthell he is and who hex92s working
tttfor...

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(sarcastic)
tttOh, so thatx92s why wex92re going in
tttthe wrong direction.

ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttWell, you lost him.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttIx92m deeply sorry, Master.

ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to 
start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttExcuse me for a moment.

ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zamx92s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunterx92s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.

ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speederx92s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM canx92t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.

OBI-WAN has jumped into the driverx92s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passengerx92s seat.

ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAMx92S hand. She grabs the Jedix92s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of itx92s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunterx92s speeder.

Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.

<b>EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT
</b>ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.

It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.

ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.

Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.

A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttAnakin!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttShe went into that club, Master.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttPatience.

OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>ttt t(continuing)
tttHere. Next time try not to lose it.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttSorry, Master.

ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttA Jedi's saber is his most
tttprecious possession.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttYes, Master.

He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttHe must keep it with him at all
ttttimes.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI know, Master.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttThis weapon is your life!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI've heard this lesson before...

OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttBut, you haven't learned anything,
tttAnakin.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI try, Master.

<b>INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</b>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhy do I think you are going to be
tttthe death of me?!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttDon't say that Master... You're
tttthe closest thing I have to a
tttfather... I love you. I don't want
tttto cause you pain.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttThen why don't you listen to me?!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI will. I'll do better, I promise.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttDo you see him him?

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI think he's a she...

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttThen be extra careful...
tttt(nods to a room)
tttCheck it out.

OBI-WAN goes away.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWhere are you going, Master?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttTo get a drink.

OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.

CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.

<b>ttttELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
</b>tttWanna buy some death sticks?

OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttYou don't want to sell me death-
tttsticks.

<b>ttttELAN
</b>tttI don't want to sell you death-
tttsticks.

OBI-WAN moves his fingers.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttYou want to go home and rethink 
tttyour life.

<b>ttttELAN
</b>tttI want to go home and rethink my
tttlife.

He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.

CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.

ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.

The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.

The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttEasy... Official business. Go
tttback to your drinks.

Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.

<b>EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</b>OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttDo you know who it was you were
ttttrying to kill?

<b>ttttZAM WESSEL
</b>tttThe Senator from Naboo.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWho hired you?

ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.

<b>ttttZAM WESSEL
</b>tttIt was just a job.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttTell us!

<b>ttttZAM WESSEL
</b>tttThat Senator's gonna die soon
tttanyway, and the next one won't
tttmake the same mistake I did...

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttThis wound's going to need

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWho hired you? Tell us... tell us
tttnow!

ZAM glares hatefully.

<b>ttttZAM
</b>tttIt was a Bounty Hunter called...

There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies.

There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttToxic Dart...

<b>INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - DAY

PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.

tttsure you have a great deal to do.

<b>ttttJAR JAR
</b>tttOf course, M'lady.

JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI do not like this idea of hiding.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttDon't worry. Now that the Council

</b>tttI'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible

PADME smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.

</b>tttMaster Obi-Wan manages not to see

</b>tttMentors have a way of seeing more

There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.

ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing.

<b>EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY 
</b>A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang.

<b>INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
</b>ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator Amidala.

DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttMay the Force be with you.

<b>INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY
</b>OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.

<b>ttttPK-4
</b>tttPlace the subject for analysis on

OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of OBI-WAN.

<b>EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER
</b>The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed.

<b>INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY
</b>The great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.

<b>ttttSERVER
</b>tttKeep moving! Keep moving!

ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.

<b>ttttFOOD SERVER
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttHey! No Droids!

ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttNo, no, Mom, no...

He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttWhat?

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttYou seemed to be having a
tttnightmare.

ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttAre you hungry?

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttThank you.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttWe went into lightspeed a while
tttago.

ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI look forward to seeing Naboo
tttagain. I've thought about it every
tttday since I left. It's by far the
tttmost beautiful place I've ever
tttseen...

PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare. 

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttYou were just a little boy then.
tttIt may not be as you remember it;
ttttime changes your perception.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI think time has given me much
tttmore mature feelings to enhance my
tttperception.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttIt must be difficult having sworn
tttyour life to the Jedi... not being
tttable to visit the places you
tttlike... or do the things you
tttlike...

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttOr be with the people I love.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttAre you allowed to love? I
tttthought that was forbidden for a
tttJedi.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttAttachment is forbidden.
tttPossession is forbidden.
tttCompassion, which I would define
tttas unconditional love, is central
tttto a Jedi's life, so you might say
tttwe're encouraged to love.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttYou have changed so much

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttYou haven't changed a bit. You're
tttexactly the way I remember you in
tttmy dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
tttchanged much either.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttIt hasn't...

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI can't wait to breathe the sweet
tttbreeze that comes off the rolling
ttthills. Whenever I try to
tttvisualise the Force, those hills
tttare what I see.

ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttI love Naboo.

There is an awkward moment.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttt(changing the subject)
tttWere you dreaming about you
tttmother earlier, weren't you?

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttYes... I left Tatooine so long
tttago, my memory of her is fading.
tttI don't want to lose it. Recently
tttI've been seeing her in my

tttdreams. I worry about her.

PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.

<b>EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING
</b>OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through.

OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.

<b>INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING
</b>A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.

<b>ttttHERMIONE
</b>tttCan I help ya?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttI'm looking for Dexter.

HERMIONE'S eyes narrow.

<b>ttttHERMIONE BAGWA
</b>tttWaddya want him for?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttHe's not in trouble. It's
tttpersonal.

HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.

<b>ttttHERMIONE BAGWA
</b>tttSomeone to see ya, honey
tttt(lowering her voice)
tttA Jedi, by the looks of him.

Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttObi-Wan!

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttHey, Dex.

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttTake a seat! Be right with ya!

OBI-WAN sits in a booth.

<b>ttttHERMIONE BAGWA
</b>tttYou want a cup of ardees?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttThank you.

HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttHey, ol' buddy!

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttHey, Dex.

DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttSo, my friend. What can I do for
tttya?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttYou can tell me what this is.

OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen. He puts down his mug.

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttWell, whattaya know...

DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttI ain't seen one of these since I
tttwas prospecting on Subterrel
tttbeyond the Outer Rim!

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttDo you know where it came from?

DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttThis baby belongs to them cloners.
tttWhat you got here is a Kamino
tttKyberdart.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttKamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
tttit didn't show up in any analysis
tttarchive.

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttIt's these funny little cuts on
tttthe side give it away...
tttThose analysis droids you've got
tttover there only focus on symbols,
tttyou know. I should think you Jedi
tttwould have more respect for the
tttdifference between knowledge and
tttwisdom.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWell, Dex, if droids could think, we
tttwouldn't be here, would we?
tttt(laughing)
tttKamino... doesn't sound familiar.
tttIs it part of the Republic?

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttNo, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
tttI'd say about twelve parsecs
tttoutside the Rishi Maze, toward the
tttsouth. It should be easy to find,
ttteven for those droids in your
tttarchive to find. Those Kaminoans
tttkeep to themselves. They're
tttcloners. Damned good ones, too.

OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttCloners? Are they friendly?

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttIt depends.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttOn what, Dex?

Dexter grins. 

<b>ttttDEXTER JETTSTER
</b>tttOn how good your manners are...
tttand how big your pocketbook is...

<b>EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY
</b>The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.

PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.

<b>EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON
</b>The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttIf I grew up here, I don't think
tttI'd ever leave.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttt(laughing)
tttI doubt that.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttNo, really. When I started my
ttttraining, I was very homesick and
tttvery lonely. This city and my Mom
tttwere the only pleasant things I
ttthad to think about... The problem
tttwas, the more I thought about my
tttMom, the worse I felt. But I
tttwould feel better if I thought
tttabout the palace - the way it
tttshimmers in the sunlight - the way
tttthe air always smells of flowers...

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>ttt...and the soft sound of the
tttdistant waterfalls. The first
ttttime I saw the Capital, I was very
tttyoung... I'd never seen a
tttwaterfall before. I though they
tttwere so beautiful... I never
tttdreamed one day I'd live in the
tttpalace.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWell, tell me, did you dream of
tttpower and politics when you were
ttta little girl?

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttt(laughing)
tttNo! That was the last thing I
tttthought of. My dream was to help
tttin the "Refugee Relief Movement."
tttI never thought of running for
tttelected office. But the more
ttthistory I studied, the more I
tttrealised how much good politicians
tttcould do. So when I was eight, I
tttjoined the "Apprentice
tttLegislators", then later on became
ttta Senatorial advisor, with such a
tttpassion that, before I knew it, I
tttwas elected Queen. Partly because
tttI scored so high on my education
tttcertificate, but for the most part
tttit was my conviction that reform
tttwas possible. I wasn't the
tttyoungest Queen ever elected, but
tttnow that I think back on it, I'm
tttnot sure I was old enough. I'm not
tttsure I was ready.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttThe people you served thought you
tttdid a good job. I heard they
ttttried to amend the Constitution so
tttyou could stay in office.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttPopular rule is not democracy,
tttAnnie. It gives the people what
tttthey want, not what they need.
tttAnd, truthfully, I was relieved
tttwhen my two terms were up. So
tttwere my parents. They worried
tttAbout me during the blockade and
tttcouldn't wait for it all to be
tttover. Actually, I was hoping to
ttthave a family by now... My
tttsisters have the most amazing,
tttwonderful kids... but when the
tttQueen asked me to serve as
tttSenator, I couldn't refuse her.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI agree! I think the Republic
tttneeds you... I'm glad you chose
tttto serve. I feel things are going
tttto happen in our generation that
tttwill change the galaxy in profound
tttways.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI think so too.

ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.

<b>INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.

<b>ttttQUEEN JAMILLIA
</b>tttWe've been worried about you.
tttt(takes her hand)
tttI'm so glad you're safe, Padmxe9.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttThank you, Your Highness. I only
tttWish I could have served you
tttbetter by staying on Coruscant for
tttthe vote.

<b>ttttSIO BIBBLE
</b>tttGiven the circumstances, Senator,
tttyou know it was the only decision
tttHer Highness could have made.

<b>ttttQUEEN JAMILLIA
</b>tttHow many systems have joined Count
tttDooku and the separatists?

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttAbout two hundred. And more are
tttleaving the Republic every day.
tttIf the Senate votes to create an
tttarmy, I'm sure it's going to push
tttus into a civil war.

<b>ttttSIO BIBBLE
</b>tttIt's unthinkable! There hasn't
tttbeen a full-scale war since the
tttformation of the Republic!

<b>ttttQUEEN JAMILLIA
</b>tttDo you see any way, through
tttnegotiations, to bring the
tttseparatists back into the Republic?

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttNot if they feel threatened. The
tttseparatists don't have an army,
tttbut if they are provoked, they
tttwill move to defend themselves.
tttI'm sure of that. And with no time
tttor money to build an army, my
tttguess is they will turn to the
tttCommerce Guilds or the Trade
tttFederation for help.

<b>ttttQUEEN JAMILLIA
</b>tttThe armies of commerce! Why has
tttNothing been done in the Senate
tttto restrain them?

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI'm afraid that, despite the
tttChancellor's best efforts, there
tttare still many bureaucrats,
tttjudges, and even Senators on the
tttpayrolls of the Guilds.

<b>ttttSIO BIBBLE
</b>tttIt's outrageous! After all of
tttthose hearings, and the four trials in
tttthe Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
tttstill the Viceroy of the Trade
tttFederation. Do those money
tttmongers control everything?

<b>ttttQUEEN JAMILLIA
</b>tttRemember, Counsellor, the courts
tttwere able to reduce the
tttFederation's armies. That's a
tttmove in the right
tttdirection.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttThere are rumours, Your Highness,
tttthat the Federation Army was not
tttreduced as they were ordered.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttThe Jedi have not been allowed to
tttinvestigate. It would be to be too
tttdangerous for the economy, we were
ttttold.

<b>ttttQUEEN JAMILLIA
</b>tttWe must keep our faith in the
tttRepublic. The day we stop
tttbelieving democracy can work is
tttthe day we lose it.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttLet's pray that day never comes.

<b>ttttQUEEN JAMILLIA
</b>tttIn the meantime, we must consider
tttyour own safety.

SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.

<b>ttttSIO BIBBLE
</b>tttt(to Anakin)
tttWhat is your suggestion, Master
tttJedi?

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttAnakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
tttHe's still a Padawan learner. I
tttwas thinking...

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(nettled)
tttHey, hold on a minute!

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttExcuse me! I was thinking I would
tttstay in the Lake Country. There
tttare some places up there that are
tttvery isolated.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttExcuse me?! I am in charge of
tttsecurity here, M'Lady.

SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttAnnie, my life is at risk, and
tttthis is my home. I know it very
tttwell... that is why we're here.
tttI think it would be wise for you
tttto take advantage of my knowledge
tttin this instance.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(takes a deep breath)
tttSorry, M'Lady.

<b>ttttSIO BIBBLE
</b>tttt(to Anakin, amused)
tttShe is right. The Lake Country is
tttthe most remote part of Naboo.
tttNot many people and a clear view
tttof the surrounding terrain.

<b>ttttQUEEN JAMILLIA
</b>tttPerfect. It's settled then.

ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.

<b>ttttQUEEN JAMILLIA
</b>tttt(continued)
tttPadmxe9, I had an audience with your
tttfather yesterday. I told him what
tttwas happening. He hopes you will
tttvisit your mother before you

tttworried about you.

PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.

<b>EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
</b>The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.

<b>INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY
</b>A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.

On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.

After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttDid you call for assistance?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(distracted in thought)
tttYes... yes, I did...

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttHe has a powerful face, doesn't
ttthe? He was one of the most
tttbrilliant Jedi I have had the
tttprivilege of knowing.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttI never understood why he quit.
tttOnly twenty Jedi have ever left
tttthe Order.

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttt(sighs)
tttThe Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
tttwas the most recent and the most
tttpainful. No one likes to talk
tttabout it. His leaving was a great
tttloss to the Order.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhat happened?

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttWell, one might say, he was always
ttta bit out of step with the
tttdecisions of the Council... much
tttlike your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(surprised)
tttReally?

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttOh, yes. They were alike in many
tttways. Very individual thinkers...
tttidealists...

JOCASTA NU stares at the bust

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttt(continuing
tttHe was always striving to become
ttta more powerful Jedi. He wanted
tttto be the best. With a lightsaber,
tttin the old style of fencing, he
ttthad no match. His knowledge of
tttthe Force was... unique. In the
tttend, I think he left because he
tttlost faith in the Republic. He
tttbelieved that politics were
tttcorrupt, and he felt the Jedi
tttbetrayed themselves by serving the
tttpoliticians. He always had very
ttthigh expectations of government.
tttHe disappeared for nine or ten
tttyears, then he just showed up
tttrecently as the head of the
tttseparatist movement.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttInteresting... I'm still not sure
tttI understand.

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttWell, I'm sure you didn't call me
tttover here for a history lesson.
tttAre you having a problem, Master
tttKenobi?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttYes, I'm trying to find a planet
tttsystem called Kamino. It doesn't
tttseem to show upon any of the
tttarchive charts.

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttKamino? It's not a system I'M
tttfamiliar with... Let me see...

JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttAre you sure you have the right
tttco-ordinates?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(nodding)
tttAccording to my information, it
tttshould be in this quadrant
tttsomewhere... just south of the
tttRishi Maze.

JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttNo co-ordinates? It sounds like the
tttkind of directions you'd get from
ttta street tout... some old miner or
tttFurbog trader.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttAll three actually.

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttAre you sure it exists?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttAbsolutely.

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttLet me do a gravitational scan.

OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttThere are some inconsistencies
ttthere. Maybe the planet you're
tttlooking for was destroyed.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWouldn't that be on record?

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttIt ought to be. Unless it was very
tttrecent.
tttt(shakes her head)
tttI hate to say it, but it looks
tttlike the system you're searching
tttfor doesn't exist.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttThat's impossible... perhaps the
tttarchives are incomplete.

<b>ttttJOCASTA NU
</b>tttThe archives are comprehensive and
ttttotally secure, my young Jedi.
tttOne thing you may be absolutely
tttsure of - if an item does not
tttappear in our records, it does not
tttexist!

OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.

<b>EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON
</b>PEOPLE are passing through the little street, OLD MEN are sunning themslves, WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing. ANAKIN, PADME and ARTOO turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his Jedi robes. PADME wear a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttThere's my house!

PADME starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttWhat? Don't say you're shy!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(untruthfully)
tttNo, but I...

Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADME.

<b>ttttRYOO & POOJA
</b>tttAunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!

<b>ttttPADME

PADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.

tttI'm so happy to see you! This is

ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:

</b>tttArtoo!!!

As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADME laughs. ANAKIN and PADME go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO.

<b>INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON

</b>tttt(continuing)
tttYou still live at home.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttI move around so much, I've never

ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttIs this you?

The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttThat was when I went with the
tttRelief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
tttTheir sun was imploding, and the
tttplanet was dying. I was helping
tttto relocate the children. See
tttthat little one I'm holding? His
tttname was N'a-kee-tula, which means
tttsweethear. He was so full of 
tttlife,. All those kids were. I did
ttteverything I could to save him,
tttbut he died... they all did. They
tttwere never able to adapt... to
tttlive off their native planet.

ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADME at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttMy first day as an Apprentice
tttLegislator. Notice the difference?

PADME pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the the stern, unsmiling adolescent.

<b>INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY

<b>INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY
</b>OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttDon't think... feel... be as one

tttMaster Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the

<b>ttttCHILDREN
</b>tttWelcome, Master Obi-Wan!

</b>tttI am sorry to disturb you, Master.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttWhat help to you, can I be?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttIx92m looking for a planet described

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttAn interesting puzzle. Gather
tttround the map reader, younglings.
tttMaster Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
tttFind it, we will try...

The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttThis is where it ought to be...
tttbut it isnx92t. Gravity is pulling
tttall the stars in this area inward
tttto this spot. There should be a
tttstar here... but there isnx92t.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttMost interesting. Gravityx92s
tttsilhouette remains, but the star
tttand all its planets have
tttdisappeared. How can this be?

There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.

<b>ttttJEDI CHILD JACK
</b>tttBecause someone erased it from the
tttarchive memory.

<b>ttttCHILDREN
</b>tttThatx92s right! Yes! Thatx92s what
ttthappened! Someone erased it!

<b>ttttJEDI CHILD MAY
</b>tttIf the planet blew up, the gravity
tttwould go away.

OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttTruly wonderful, the mind of a

tttcentre of the pull of gravity go,
tttand find your planet you will.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttBut Master Yoda who could have

<b>EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake.

<b>EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON
</b>ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge.

ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttWhen I was in Level Three, we used
tttto come here for school retreat.
tttSee that island? We used to swim
tttthere every day. I love the water.

</b>tttI do too. I guess it comes from
tttgrowing up on a desert planet.

PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>ttt...We used to lie on the sand and
tttlet the sun dry us... and try to
tttguess the names of the birds
tttsinging.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI donx92t like sand. Itx92s coarse
tttand rough and irritating, and it
tttgets everywhere. Not like here.
tttHere everythingx92s soft... and
tttsmooth...

He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttThere was a very old man who lived
ttton the island. He used to make
tttglass out of sand - and vases and
tttnecklaces out of the glass. They
tttwere magical.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(looks into her eyes)
tttEverything here is magical.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttYou could look into the glass and
tttsee the water. The way it ripples
tttand moves. It looked so real...
tttbut it wasnx92t.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttSometimes, when you believe
tttsomething to be real, it becomes
tttreal. Real enough, anyway...

They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI used to think if you looked too
tttdeeply into glass, you would
tttlose yourself.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI think it's true...

ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI shouldn't have done that.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI'm sorry. When I'm around you,
tttmy mind is no longer my own.

</b>tttIt's the situation... the stress...

He looks at her.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>ttt...the view.

</b>tttBut he still has much to learn.
tttAnd his abilities have made him...

tttwhat you and Master Yoda knew from
tttthe beginning... the boy was too
tttold to start the training and...

OBI-WAN hesitates.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttThere's something else?

</b>tttMaster, he should not have been
tttgiven this assignment. I'm afraid
tttAnakin won't be able to protect

</b>tttWhy?

</b>tttHe has a... an emotional
tttconnection with her. It's been
tttthere since he was boy. Now
ttthe's confused... distracted.

<b>ttttMACE-WINDU
</b>tttObi-Wan, you must have faith that
ttthe will take the right path.

OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.

</b>tttHas Master Yoda gained any insight
tttinto whether or not this war will
tttcome about?

<b>INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.

<b>EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON
</b>The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge.

<b>INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttYou did that?

ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWhat?

PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttThat! Now stop it!

PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttAnakin!!

ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI'm not really supposed to do
tttthat... for fun, I mean. If
tttMaster Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
tttvery grumpy.

ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.

<b>INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT
</b>A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.

She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttMay I tell you something?

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttI don't know.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttThen how can I tell you?

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttMaybe you should use your Jedi
tttintuition.

</b>tttIt doesn't work around you. My

</b>tttFrom the moment I met you, all
tttthose years ago, a day hasn't gone
tttby when I haven't thought of you.
tttAnd now that I'm close to you again,
tttI'm in agony. The closer I get to

tttIf you are suffering as much as I

</b>tttAnything's possible. Padme,

</b>tttYou listen. We live in a real

</b>tttThen you do feel something!
tttThere's an extraordinary

tttdeny that.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttAnnie, it doesn't make any

</b>tttI was destined to be a Jedi. I

tttcan't.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttI am not going to give into this.
tttI'm not going to throw my life

There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttIt wouldn't have to be that way...
tttwe could keep it a secret.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttThen we'd be living a lie - one we

Silence for a moment.

</b>ttt...No, you're right. It would
tttdestroy us.

<b>EXT. SPACE
</b>It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.

<b>EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
</b>Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world.

The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE
</b>A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face.

<b>ttttTAUN WE
</b>tttWelcome to Tipoca City, Master
tttJedi.

OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes.

</b>tttEverything is ready. The Prime
tttMinister expects you.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN

OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor.

Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY

<b>EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON
</b>PADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly.

Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADME is picking flowers.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI don't know...

</b>tttThey only work on the weak-minded.
tttYou are anything but weak-minded.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttAll right... his name was Palo.
tttI was twelve. We were both in the

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttAll right, I get the picture...
tttwhatever happened to him?

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI went on to become a Queen. He

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttMaybe he was the smart one.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttYou really don't like politicians,

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI like two or three, but I'm not
tttreally sure about one of them.
tttt(smiling)
tttI don't think the system works.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttHow would you have it work?

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWe need a system where the
tttpoliticians sit down and discuss
tttthe problems, agree what's in the
tttbest interests of all the people,
tttand then do it.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttThat is exactly what we do. The
ttttrouble is that people don't
tttwlways agree. In fact, they
ttthardly ever do.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttThen they should be made to.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttBy whom? Who's going to make them?

</b>tttBut someone.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttSomeone wise.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttThat sounds an awful lot like a

A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWell, if it works...

PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttYou're making fun of me.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>ttt t(sarcastic)
tttOn no, I'd be much too frightened
tttto tease a Senator.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttYou're so bad!

PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttYou're always so serious. Always
tttcarrying the weight of the
tttuniverse on your shoulders.

ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.

ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.

The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.

ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.

<b>EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttWe modified their genetic
tttstructure to make them less
tttindependent than the original
ttthost. As a result they are
ttttotally obedient, taking any order
tttwithout question.

<b>ttttOBI-WAM
</b>tttWho was the original host?

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttA bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
tttWe felt a Jedi would be the
tttperfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
tttpicked Jango Fett himself.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttWhere is this bounty hunter now?

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttOh, we keep him here. After a few
ttthundred thousand clones, the
tttgenetic pattern starts to fade, so
tttwe take a fresh supply. He lives
ttthere, but he's free to come and go
tttas he pleases.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY
</b>The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep.

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttApart from his pay, which is
tttconsiderable, Fett demanded only
tttone thing - an unaltered clone for
ttthimself. Curious isn't it?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttUnaltered?

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttPure genetic replication. No
ttttampering with the structure to
tttmake it more docile... and no
tttgrowth acceleration...

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttI would like to meet this Jango
tttFett.

<b>ttttTAUN WE
</b>tttI would be most happy to arrange
tttit, for you.

TAUN WE bows, and leaves.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttYou mentioned growth
tttacceleration...

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttOh yes, it's essential.
tttOtherwise, a mature clone would
ttttake a lifetime to grow. Now, we
tttcan do it in half the time. Those
tttitems you saw on the parade ground
tttwere started ten years ago, when
tttSido-dyas first placed the order,
tttand they're already mature...

OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttAnd these?

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttAbout five years ago.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY
</b>They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttThey're immensely superior to
tttdroids, capable of independent
tttthought and action.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttVery impressive.

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttI'd hoped you would be pleased. 

OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(carefully)
tttTell me, prime minister, when my
tttMaster Sido-dyas first contacted
tttyou, did he say the order was
tttfor... himself... or?

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttHimself? Of course not. This
tttarmy is for the Republic?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(astonished)
tttThe Repubic?

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttWe are also very much agasint this
tttCount Dooku and his seccessionist
tttmovement. We are proud to be of
ttthelp to the Republic.

</b>TAUN WE shows OBI-WAN into his room.

<b>ttttTAUN WE
</b>tttI have arranged for you to meet
tttJango Fett in the morning. Sleep
tttwell.

TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink.

</b>tttArfour, Arfour...

<b>EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
</b>The R4 D17, Obi-Wan's Astro-Droid, who is sitting on top of Obi-Wan's Starfighter, switches on and BEEPS.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
</b>OBI-WAN hears ARFOUR BEEP through his comlink.

</b>ARFOUR BEEPS and WHISTLES. The panels light up inside the cockpit, as the message is transmitted.

<b>EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVINF QUARTERS - EARLY EVENING
</b>YODA and MACE WINDU listen as a hologram of OBI-WAN stands between them broadcasting the massage. The singnal is very weak, the image fades in and out.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN (V.O.)
</b>ttt...I've never heard of a Jedi
tttcalled Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttNo. Whoever placed that order was
tttnot a Jedi, I can assure you.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN (V.O.)
</b>tttI have a strong feeling that this
tttbounty hunter is the assassin
tttwe're looking for.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttWho he is working for... discover
tttthat, you must.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN (V.O.)
</b>tttI will, Master, and I will also
tttfind out more about this clone

The hologram switches off, and OBI-WAN fades away.

<b>ttttWINDU 
</b>tttA clone army! Ordered by someone
tttin the Senate perhaps... Someone's
tttout to start a war.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttInform the chancellor of this, we
tttmust.

<b>ttttWINDU
</b>tttWho do you think this impostor
tttSido-Dyas, could be?

YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head.

<b>EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT - NIGHT
</b>The silent lodge. The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil waters of the lake.

<b>INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>ANAKIN moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat 
forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttNo...No...No...Mom!...Don't,
tttno, don't!

<b>EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS - MORNING

</b>tttt(eyes closed)
tttDon't go.

<b>ttttPAMDE
</b>tttI don't want to disturb you.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttAnnie, I told you I wouldn't let

tttI'll go with you. That way you

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWhat about Master Obi-wan?

PADME smiles and takes his hand.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttI guess we won't tell him, will we?

<b>EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY
</b>ANAKIN and PADME step onto the landing platform from the water speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them on board. The ramp retracts.

PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's Starship takes off.

<b>EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
</b>Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett's apartment. TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS.

As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom.

<b>ttttTAUN WE
</b>tttBoba, is your father here?

There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.

<b>ttttTAUN WE
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttMay we see him?

<b>ttttBOBA FETT
</b>tttSure.

Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
</b>OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI-WAN looks around the room.

<b>ttttBOBA FETT
</b>tttDad! Taun We's here!

JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.

<b>ttttTAUN WE
</b>tttWelcome back, Jango. Was your
ttttrip productive?

<b>ttttJANGO FETT
</b>tttFairly.

OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them.

<b>ttttTAUN WE
</b>tttThis is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
tttKenobi. He's come to check on our
tttprogress.

<b>ttttJANGO FETT
</b>tttThat right?

JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttYour clones are very impressive.
tttYou must be very proud.

<b>ttttJANGO FETT
</b>tttI'm just a simple man, trying to
tttmake my way in the universe,
tttMaster Jedi.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttAren't we all?

OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttEver made your way as far into the
tttinterior as Coruscant?

<b>ttttJANGO
</b>tttOnce or twice.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttRecently?

<b>ttttJANGO
</b>tttt(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
tttPossibly...

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttThen you must know Master Sido-
tttDyas?

<b>ttttJANGO
</b>tttBoba, close the door.

BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.

<b>ttttJANGO
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttMaster who?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttSido-Dyas. Isnx92t he the Jedi who
ttthired you for this job?

<b>ttttJANGO
</b>tttNever heard of him. I was
tttrecuited by a man called Darth
tttTyranus on one of the moons of
tttBogden.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttNo? I thought...

<b>ttttTAUN WE
</b>tttSido-Dyas told us to expect him.
tttAnd he showed up just when your
tttJedi Master said he would. We
ttthave kept the Jedix92s involvement
ttta secret until your arrival, just
tttas your Master requested.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttCurious...

<b>ttttJANGO
</b>tttDo you like your army?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttIt seems to me it's your army -
tttbeing that they are all clones of
tttyou.

</b>tttt(grinning)
tttThey'll do their job well, I'll
tttguarantee that.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttI look forward to seeing them in
tttaction. Thank you for your time,
tttJango.

<b>ttttJANGO
</b>tttAlways a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO FETT turns to his son. He is deep in thought.

<b>ttttBOBA
</b>tttWhat is it, Dad?

<b>EXT. SPACE
</b>The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY
</b>The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADME ride a rickshaw through the streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn't seen for years. Finally, they come  to Wattos' shop, and the rickshaw stops.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(to the droid driver)
tttWait, please.

ANAKIN and PADME get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.

<b>ttttWATTO
</b>tttt(yelling, in Huttese)
tttNo, not that one - that one!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(arriving)
tttExcuse me, Watto.

<b>ttttWATTO
</b>tttt(in Huttese)
tttWhat?

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(in Huttese)
tttI said excuse me.

WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.

<b>ttttWATTO
</b>tttt(in Huttese)
tttShut down.

The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.

<b>ttttWATTO
</b>tttt(continuing, in Huttese)
tttWhat? I don't know you... What can
tttI do for you? You look like a
tttJedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
tttdo it.

WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttLet me help you with that.

ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. WATTO blinks in surprise.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttI'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADME, then back to ANAKIN.

<b>ttttWATTO
</b>tttAnnie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!

Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into life. WATTO blinks at it.

<b>ttttWATTO
</b>tttt(continuing; in English)
tttYou are Annie! It is you! You
tttlittle womp rat.

WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.

<b>ttttWATTO
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttYou sure sprouted Weehoo! A

</b>tttOh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttSold her...

<b>ttttWATTO
</b>tttYears ago. Sorry, Anne, but you

tttSold her to a moisture farmer

<b>ttttWATTO
</b>tttLong way from here... someplace

tttEisley, I think...

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI'd like to know.

ANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.

<b>ttttWATTO
</b>tttYeah... sure... absolutely. Let's
tttgo look in my records.

ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.

<b>EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
</b>The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door.

<b>ttttLAMA SU
</b>tttTell your Council the first
tttbattalions are ready. And remind
tttthem that if they need more
ttttroops, we will need time to grow
tttthem.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttI won't forget.

<b>EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
</b>OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale.

Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.

<b>INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
</b>OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.

OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.

<b>EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
</b>JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:

<b>ttttBOBA FETT
</b>tttDad!!

JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.

JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.

The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.

JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.

IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.

IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.

OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.

The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.

JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.

OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.

Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.

OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.

JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.

OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:

A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY
</b>The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN and PADME get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttStay with the ship, Artoo.

ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADME start down the trail toward the homestead.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
</b>C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN and PADME arrive,

</b>tttGood evening. May I help you?

</b>tttThreepio?

</b>tttMaster Lars - Master Owen!
tttSomebody to see you!

OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here

</b>tttI had a feeling you might show up
tttsome day.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttIs my mother here?

<b>ttttCLIEGG
</b>tttNo, she's not.

CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.

<b>ttttCLIEGG
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttCliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife...
tttCome on inside. We have a lot to
ttttalk about.

<b>INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY

</b>CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the drinks from the kitchen.

<b>ttttCLIEGG
</b>tttYour mother had gone out early,

tttafter her. Four of us came back.
tttThree more are still out there

CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.

tttThis isn't the way I wanted to

tttyour mother and I planned it. I

</b>tttShe's daed, son. Accept it.

</b>tttI can feel her pain, and I will

ANAKIN turns abruptly.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
</b>ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME.

</b>tttYou are going to have to stay

</b>tttTake my speeder bike.

</b>tttI trust you'll watch over her,

<b>ttttOWEN
</b>tttDon't worry.

ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.

</b>tttI won't be long.

ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go.

<b>EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
</b>The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it.

<b>INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS

<b>ttttJANGO FETT
</b>tttNearly there, son.

JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:

<b>ttttBOBA FETT
</b>tttDad, look!!

On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.

<b>ttttJANGO FETT
</b>tttHang on!

The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.

<b>EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
</b>The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through.

Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids.

In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by.

<b>ttttBOBA FETT
</b>tttDad! Watch out!

<b>ttttJANGO FETT
</b>tttStay calm, son. We'll be fine.
tttThat Jedi won't be able to follow
tttus through this.

But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.

IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.

IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.

<b>ttttBOBA FETT
</b>tttGot him! Yeahhhhh!

<b>ttttJANGO FETT
</b>tttWe won't see him again.

BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET
</b>ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT
</b>ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance.

He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are bodies of THREE DEAD FARMERS lying beside the campfire. TWO EOPIES are thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
</b>THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
</b>The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal HOWLS.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
</b>PADME is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.

<b>INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
</b>PADME stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence. Then:

<b>ttttC-3PO
</b>tttPlease don't leave us, Miss Padme.
tttThese people need your help.

THREEPIO is parked in a corner.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttI'm not leaving, Threepio. I just

</b>tttBeing like what?

</b>tttNaked. If you pardon the

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttI guess I wouldn't like it at all.

<b>ttttC-3PO
</b>tttOf course you wouldn't. Nobody
tttwould. It's simply not protocol.

PADME looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttMaybe we can do something about it.

<b>ttttC-3PO
</b>tttI don't think so. Only Master
tttAnnie...

</b>tttWhy not? They seem to have a box

<b>ttttC-3PO
</b>tttOh? How observant of you, Miss
tttPadme. Of course, I'm just not

PADME picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.

</b>tttOoooh! That's tickles.

<b>EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
</b>A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan's Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on the pitted back side of the great rock.

<b>INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
</b>OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He starts the engines of his fighter.

Obi-Wan's Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis.

<b>EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
</b>Obi-Wan's ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He looks around.

Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains.

The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks his bearings, then heads away.

<b>EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
</b>OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.

OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it.

He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.

A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
</b>ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
</b>ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.

<b>INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT
</b>The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.

A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.

He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been 
terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttMom... Mom... Mom... 

SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.

<b>ttttSHMI
</b>tttAnnie...? Is it you?

SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttIx92m here, Mom. Youx92re safe. Hang
ttton. Ix92m going to get you out of
ttthere...

<b>ttttSHMI
</b>tttIx92m so glad... to see you,
tttAnnie... Now... I am complete...

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttJust stay with me, Mom. Ix92m going
tttto make you well again.
tttEverythingx92s going to be fine.

<b>ttttSHMI
</b>tttYou look so handsome. My son...
tttmy grown-up son. Ix92m so proud of
tttyou, Annie... so proud... I missed
tttyou so much... I love...

SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.

<b>EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
</b>OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.

OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.

SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.

<b>EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN
</b>The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.

As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakinx92s lightsaber switches on.

<b>EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
</b>OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink.

</b>LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building.

<b>INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE
</b>A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>ttt...Starships from the Trade
tttFederation and the Commerce Guilds
tttare taking deliveries of battle
tttdroids from the foundries on
tttGeonosis.

<b>ttttBAIL ORGANA
</b>tttThat's outrageous! The treaty

tttthey doing?!

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttThe droid foundry seems to be
tttworking at full capacity. I am
tttgoing to go down and investigate.
tttI will bring Jango Fett back home
tttfor interrogation.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttThose Geonosian foundries are part
tttof the Techno Union. We will call
tttin their representatives and ask
tttthem a few very pointed questions.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttOne more thing. Jango mentioned
ttthe was recruited by someone named
tttDarth Tyranus. Any idea who that
tttmight be?

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttWith the forename Darth, a Sith he
tttmust be.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttOur missing apprentice. They are
tttplaying their hand at last.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttDo you believe he could be the
tttmysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
tttdeal for the clone army?

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttPerhaps too many pieces are missing
tttfrom this puzzle, there are.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttBe careful, Obi-Wan. This
tttinvestigation is becoming less
tttthan routine. Do you need help?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttLet me see if I can figure out
tttwhat's going on first.

The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief.

<b>ttttBAIL ORGANA
</b>tttThe Commerce Guilds are preparing
tttfor war... there can be no doubt
tttof that.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttCount Dooku must have made a

</b>tttWe must stop them soon before
tttthey're fully ready.

<b>ttttSENATOR ASK AAK
</b>tttThe debate is over, we need

<b>ttttBAIL ORGANA
</b>tttUnfortunately, the debate is not
tttover. The Senate will never be
tttable to approve the use of that
tttarmy before the separatists
tttattack.

Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.

<b>ttttMAS AMEDDA
</b>tttThis is a crisis! If the Senate
tttvotes the Chancellor emergency
tttpowers, he could approve the use
tttof the army in a minute.

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttPlease, please, I don't wish to
ttthave emergency powers. That's too
tttextreme a solution. It's akin to

tttthe Jedi. Master Yoda, how many

MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttTwo Hundred,... less or more.

<b>ttttBAIL ORGANA
</b>tttWith all due respect for the Jedi
tttOrder, two hundred will be no
tttmatch for hundreds of thousands of
tttbattle droids.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttPatience. We should wait for Obi-

tttthat Count Dooku has made a treaty
tttwith the Corporate Alliance, it's
tttspeculation.

<b>ttttSENATOR ASK AAK
</b>tttBut we must prepare for the worst.
tttI'm going to propose a motion
tttgranting emergency powers to the
tttChancellor at the next session. We
tttmust not wait!

<b>ttttPALPATINE
</b>tttOut of the question, Senator! You
tttand I are too closely aligned.
tttThe issue will become partisan and
tttdebates will begin. The proposal
tttmust come from a neutral source.

<b>ttttMAS AMEDDA
</b>tttIf only Senator Amidala were here.

JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.

<b>ttttJAR JAR
</b>tttSupreme Chancellor... my august
tttcolleagues, I would be proud to
tttpropose the motion in question.
tttThis is a grave situation, and I'm

</b>tttThank you, Representative Binks.

Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.

</b>tttIf called upon, I will serve. But

</b>PADME fixes the last piece of covering onto THREEPIO.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttThere!

PADME stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn't the golden figure we know because PADME has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete.

tttOh, pardon me.

THREEPIO drops his hand and bows formally.

</b>tttThey'll never get there in time to

</b>tttSenator Amidala, I've heard so
tttmuch about you.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttCount Dooku, I assume.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttI'm delighted to meet you at
tttlast. We have a great deal to
tttdiscuss, Senator. I hope you can
tttkeep your young Jedi under control.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttDon't worry he's housebroken.

<b>INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY
</b>COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADME on the far 
side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttYou are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
tttWan Kenobi. I am formally
tttrequesting you turn him over to
tttme, now.

<b>ttttDOOKU
</b>tttHe has been convicted of
tttespionage, Senator, and will be
tttexecuted. In just a few hours, I
tttbelieve.

COUNT DOOKU smiles.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttHe is an officer of the Republic.
tttYou can't do that.

<b>ttttDOOKU
</b>tttWe don't recognise the Republic
ttthere, Senator. But if Naboo were
tttto join our Alliance, I could
ttteasily hear your plea for clemency.

ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttAnd if I don't join your
tttrebellion, I assume this Jedi with
tttme will also die?

<b>ttttDOOKU
</b>tttI don't wish to make you to join
tttour cause against your will,
tttSenator, but you are a rational,
ttthonest representative of your
tttpeople and I assume you want to do
tttwhat's in their best interest.
tttAren't you fed up with the
tttcorruption, the bureaucrats, the
ttthypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
tttyou? Be honest, Senator.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttThe ideals are still alive, Count,
ttteven if the institution is failing.

<b>ttttDOOKU
</b>tttYou believe in the same ideals we
tttbelieve in! The same ideals we
tttare striving to make prominent.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttIf what you say is true, you
tttshould stay in the Republic and
ttthelp Chancellor Palpatine put
tttthings right.

<b>ttttDOOKU
</b>tttThe Chancellor means well, M'Lady
tttbut he is incompetent. He has
tttpromised to cut the bureaucracy,
tttbut the bureaucrats are stronger
tttthan ever, no? Senator, the
tttRepublic cannot be fixed. It is
ttttime to start over. The
tttdemocratic process in the Republic
tttis a sham, a shell game played
ttton the voters. It will not be long
tttbefore the cult of greed, called
tttthe Republic, will lose even the
tttpretext of democracy and freedom.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI cannot believe that. I will not
tttforsake all I have honoured and
tttworked for and betray the
tttRepublic. I know of your treaties
tttwith the Trade Federation, the
tttCommerce Guilds, and the others,
tttCount. What is happening here is
tttnot government that has been
tttbought out by business... it's
tttbusiness becoming government!

<b>ttttDOOKU
</b>tttAre you willing to betray your Jedi
tttfriends? Without your co-operation
tttI can do nothing to stop their
tttexecution.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttWhat is to happen to me? Am I to be
tttexecuted also?

<b>ttttDOOKU
</b>tttI wouldn't think of such an
tttoffence. But, there are
tttindividuals who have a strong
tttinterest in your demise, M'lady.
tttIt has nothing to do with
tttpolitics, I'm afraid. It's purely
tttpersonal, and they have already
tttpaid great sums to have you
tttassassinated. I'm sure they will
tttpush hard to have you included in
tttthe executions. I'm sorry but if
tttyou are not going to co-operate, I
tttmust turn you over to the
tttGeonosians for justice. I've done
tttall I can for you.

JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN.

<b>ttttJANGO FETT
</b>tttI'll take that weapon.

ANAKIN hesitates.

<b>ttttDOOKU 
</b>tttYou may cause a lot of bloodshed,
tttmy young Jedi, but you will not
tttescape.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttAnakin...

ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.

<b>INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY
</b>ANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.

<b>ttttSUN RIT
</b>tttYou have been charged and found
tttguilty of Espionage.

<b>ttttPOGGLE
</b>tttDo you have anything to say before
tttyour sentence is carried out?

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttYou are committing an act of war,
tttArchduke. I hope you are prepared
tttfor the consequences.

POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.

<b>ttttPOGGLE
</b>tttWe build weapons, Senator... that
tttis our business! Of course we're
tttprepared!

<b>ttttNUTE GUNRAY
</b>tttGet on with it. Carry out the
tttsentence. I want to see her suffer.

<b>ttttPOGGLE
</b>tttYour other Jedi friend is waiting
tttfor you, Senator. Take them to
tttthe arena!

FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.

<b>INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
</b>In the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other.

The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttDon't be afraid.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI'm not afraid to die. I've been
tttdying a little bit each day since
tttyou came back into my life.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWhat are you talking about?

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI love you.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttYou love me?! I thought we
tttdecided not to fall in love. That
tttwe would be forced to live a lie.
tttThat it would destroy our lives...

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttI think our lives are about to be
tttdestroyed anyway. My love for you
tttis a puzzle, Annie, for which I
ttthave no answers. I can't control
tttit... and now I don't care. I
ttttruly, deeply love you, and before
tttwe die I want you to know.

PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for 
their lips to meet. They kiss.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI have no desire to be cured of
tttthis love either. Long or short,
tttI vow to spend the rest of my life
tttwith you.

They kiss again.

The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena

<b>INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
</b>The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttI was beginning to wonder if you
ttthad gotten my message.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI retransmitted it as you
tttrequested, Master. Then we decided
tttto come and rescue you.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttIt looks like you're going a good
tttjob so far.

Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.

<b>ttttSUN RIT
</b>tttThe felons before you have been
tttconvicted of espionage against the
tttSovereign System of Geonosis.
tttTheir sentence of death is to be
tttcarried out in this public arena
ttthenceforth.

The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.

<b>ttttPOGGLE
</b>tttLet the executions begin!

The crowd goes wild.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI have a bad feeling about this.

From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.

The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttTake the one the left. I'll
ttttake the one on the right.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttWhat about Padme?

PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttIt looks like she's already on top
tttof things.

The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post

OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.

The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.

ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.

The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.

In the archducal box:

<b>ttttNUTE GUNRAY
</b>tttFoul!! She can't do that... shoot
ttther or something!

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttYou okay?

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttt(nods, gasping)
tttSure! Well, sort of.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttJump!!!

The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.

<b>ttttNUTE GUNRAY
</b>tttThis isn't how it's supposed to
tttbe! Jango, finish her off.

COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttt(smiling enigmatically)
tttPatiece, Viceroy... she will die.
tttMaybe this is the way it's
tttsupposed to end.

OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.

<b>INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
</b><b>ARTOO BEEPS
</b>
<b>ttttC-3PO
</b>tttYes, it has been rather a long
ttttime. Do you suppose something's
ttthappened to them?

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

<b>ttttC-3PO
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttDanger? Oh no, I shouldn't think
tttso. It looks a very dull planet
tttto me. They should be back
tttshortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.

<b>EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
</b>In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttMaster Windu, how pleasant of you
tttto join us. You're just in time
tttfor the moment of truth. I would
tttthink these two new boys of yours
tttcould use a little more training.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttSorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
tttThis party's over.

MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttt(to Mace Windu)
tttBrave, but stupid, my old Jedi
tttfriend. You're impossibly
tttoutnumbered.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttI don't think so. One Jedi has to
tttbe worth a hundred Geonosians.

COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttIt wasn't the Geonosians I was
tttthinking about. How well do you
tttthink one Jedi will hold up
tttagainst a thousand battle droids?

COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.

MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.

The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.

Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.

<b>INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP
</b>ARTOO whistles.

<b>ttttC-3PO
</b>tttI don't hear anything.
tttt(Artoo beeps)
tttYou're scaring me! Stop imagining
tttthings!

<b>EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
</b>Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena.

ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.

MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttSomeone's got to - shut down -
tttthese droids.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttDon't worry! It's being - taken
tttcare of!

<b>EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY
</b>KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.

<b>INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY
</b>KI-ADI-MUNDI and teh surviving JEDI fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing DROIDS.

<b>INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY
</b>THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS. The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!

There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.

<b>ttttPLO KOON
</b>tttWe've done it! Now we have a
tttchance!

Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.

<b>ttttKI-ADI-MUNDI
</b>tttThe system's off but they're still
tttactive. That's a new feature. They
tttare independent of the control
tttsystem.

<b>EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
</b>MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.

At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up.

KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.

In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttMaster Windu!

Silence.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttYou have fought gallantly. Worthy
tttof recognition in the history
tttarchives of the Jedi Order. Now
tttit is finished.
tttt(pauses briefly)
tttSurrender - and your lives will be 
tttspared.

<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttWe will not be hostages for you to
tttbarter with Dooku.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttThen, I'm sorry, old friend. You
tttwill have to be destroyed.

The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.

<b>ttttPADME
</b>tttLook!

Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttCome on - hurry! Hurry!

The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.

<b>EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
</b>The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.

<b>INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY
</b>MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttMore battalions to the left.
tttEncircle them we must, then
tttdivide.

The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.

<b>INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
</b>THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere.

<b>ttttC-3PO
</b>tttI'm sure I heard something, this
ttttime. Didn't you? It's probably
tttjust a celebration

ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.

<b>EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY
</b>Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.

<b>INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY
</b>OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.

The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttHold on! Look over there...

Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttIt's Dooku, go after him!

The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttPadme!!!

ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttt(continuing; to pilot)
tttPut the ship down! Down!

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttNo! Forget her. We have to go
tttafter Dooku.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttNo we're not!! Land this ship!

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttDon't let your personal feelings
tttget in the way. We've got a job to
tttdo.

Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI don't care!.. Go back.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttAnakin! She's all right! Look.

ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttFollow that speeder!

On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.

Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.

<b>INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY
</b>COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.

<b>ttttDROID CAPTAIN
</b>tttYour Excellency!

COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttThat won't be necessary, Captain.
tttStand down. And leave them to me.

The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(to Anakin)
tttWe move in together - you slowly
ttton the...

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI'm taking him now!

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttAnakin, no!

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttYou'll pay for all the Jedi you've
tttkilled today, Dooku.

ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttKenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
tttmy Jedi powers are far beyond
tttyours. Now, back down.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttI don't think so.

OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttAh, but if I must.

COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttI have spent the last ten years
tttlearning to use the power of the
tttDark Side. It gives me infinitely
tttgreater power.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttYou will have to prove it.

OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttGrand Master Kenobi, you
tttdisappoint me. Yoda holds you in
tttsuch high esteem.

COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttSurely you can do better...?
tttt(parries)
tttNo, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
tttswordsmanship degenerated so
tttquickly, or are you trying to make
tttfun of me?
tttt(cuts)
tttWhich is it?

COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttcome, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
tttout of my misery.

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.

COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.

OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.

COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU

tttThat's brave of you, boy - but
tttfoolish. I would have thought
tttyou'd have learnt your lesson.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttI'm a slow learner.

And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttYou have unusual powers, young
tttPadawan. But not enought to save
tttyou this time.

<b>ttttANAKIN
</b>tttDon't bet on it!

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttAnakin!

OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.

Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.

Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.

Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttMaster Yoda. At last we shall
tttknow who is the most powerful.

YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttCount Dooku. No interest in
tttcontests, do I have.

COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.

YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.

Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttThe end for you, Count, this is.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>ttt...Not yet...

COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.

ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.

YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADMxc9 and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.

<b>ttttPADMxc9
</b>tttAnakin!

PADMxc9 runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.

<b>ttttCLONE CAPTAIN
</b>tttResistance is at an end, General.
tttWhat are your orders ?

YODA looks at him and sighs.

<b>EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN
</b>COUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.

<b>INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
</b>The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttThe Force is with us, my Master.

<b>ttttDARTH SIDIOUS
</b>tttWelcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have
tttdone well.

<b>ttttCOUNT DOOKU
</b>tttI bring you good news, my Lord.
tttThe war has begun.

<b>ttttDARTH SIDIOUS
</b>tttExcellent. 
ttt t(smiling)
tttEverything is going as planned.

<b>EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - SUNSET
</b>The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun.

<b>INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - SUNSET
</b>
<b>ttttMACE WINDU
</b>tttWhere is your apprentice?

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttOn his way back to Naboo. He is
tttescorting Senator Amidala home.

They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.

<b>ttttOBI-WAN
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttI must admit without the clones,
tttit would not have been a victory.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttVictory? Victory, you say?

OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.

<b>ttttYODA
</b>tttt(continuing)
tttNot victory, a defeat, it was...
tttMaster Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
tttWar has!

<b>EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY
</b>In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, ANAKIN and PADME stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.

THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME kiss.

<b>EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY
</b>PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.

On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.

The Great Clone War has begun...

<b>FADE OUT:

THE END
