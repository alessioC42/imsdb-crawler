<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY
</b>
tA mountain peak dominates the landscape.


<b>tTITLES BEGIN.
</b>
tRiders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a
tcompany of Army Cavalry Soldiers.

<b>tCLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS
</b>
treveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted
tagainst the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.

tThe OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.

<b>tttOFFICER
</b>ttDis-mount!

tRIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that
tthis is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The
t"Commanding Officer" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.

tOne of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse,
tbends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.

<b>               tttFIRST SCOUT
</b>ttHerman's horsesick!

tA BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored
thair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite
tfor knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his
tuniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.

<b>               tttSCOUTMASTER
</b>ttChaps, don't anybody wander off.
ttSome of the passageways in here
ttcan run for miles.

tTwo Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.


<b>tINT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
tThe two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops
tseveral degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair.

tHERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's
tdrawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.


<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>               tttHERMAN
</b>ttI don't think this is such a good
ttidea.

tLAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source.

tThe VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light
tof kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach
tcautiously, careful to stay hidden.

<b>tttHERMAN
</b>ttWhat is it?

tThis is what they see:


tFOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the
tpueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."

tThe men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery
tBoy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his
tshoulders).

tAnd the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT
tFEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet
tanything that this is INDLANA JONES.

tHowever, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow,
twe are shocked to discover that it is someone else.

tWe'll call him FEDORA.

<b>TITLES END.
</b>
tThe TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.

tNow we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES.

<b>                  tt               FEDORA
</b>t                 tAlfred, did you get anything yet?
<b>ttt
</b><b>tttMAN
</b>           t     tNothing. Dig in.

tTwo of the men stand and look at ROSCOE who steps forward holding a box in his
thands.

<b>                  tttROSCOE
</b>ttHey, I've got something!

tWhoops from the other men.

<b>tt                ROSCOE
</b>ttI got something, Garth!

<b>CONTINUED: (2)
</b>
tROSCOE rushes forward and gives FEDORA the box. Fedora steps toward a
tlantern resting on a rock.

<b>               tttROSCOE
</b>ttI got something... I got something
ttright here.

tMore whoops from the other men.

tFEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes
tROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the
tbox as Fedora opens it.

<b>tttROSCOE
</b>        tt      (more whoops; then)
ttOh, look at thatl
        tt      (more whoops)
ttWe're richl We're rich!

<b>               tttHALFBREED
</b>ttShut up. Shut up.

tFEDORA takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's
tcomrades practically salivate at the sight of it.

<b>               tttROSCOE (O.S.)
</b>ttWell, we're rich, ain't we?l

tINDY takes off his hat and looks down at the o.s. action.

<b>               tttHERMAN
</b>ttIndy? Indy? What are they doing?
ttIndiana? Indiana?

<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttShhhl

tFEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its
tbeauty... and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to
tthem.

<b>               tttHALFBREED
</b>ttHey, we got to find more stuff
ttto bring back.

tINDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.

<b>tttINDY
</b>        tt      (hushed; urgent)
ttIt's the Cross of Coronadol
ttCortes gave it to him in 15201


<b>CONTINUED: (3)
</b>
tFEDORA continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box
tand the lantern.

tINDY turns back to observe the men.

<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttThat Cross is an important artifact.
ttIt belongs in a museum.

tA look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward
<b>tHERMAN.
</b>
<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttRun back and find the others.
ttTell Mister Havelock that there
ttare men looting in the caves.

tHERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror
tas a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.

<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttHave him bring the sheriff.

tINDY matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. HERMAN gasps.

<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttIt's only a snake.

tINDY grabs HERMAN's scout scarf and pulls him closer.

<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttDid you hear what I said?

<b>               tttHERMAN
</b>ttRight. Run back. Mister Havelock.
ttThe Sheriff. What, what are you
ttgonna do?

<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttI don't know... I'll think of
ttsomething.

tINDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees
tthe Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for
tadditional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of
tthe Cross...

tFEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.

<b>               tttFEDORA
</b>ttDig with your hands.

tINDY picks up the Cross.


<b>CONTINUED: (4)
</b>
<b>               tttFEDORA (O . S . )
</b>ttNot with your mouth.

tAs FEDORA stands watching the other men digging, INDY puts the Cross in his
tpants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's
tfeet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.

<b>               tttROSCOE
</b>ttHe's got our thing!

<b>ttt HALFBREED
</b>ttGet 'im!

<b>                                  
</b>
tThe three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock
teach other over in the attempt.

tOnly FEDORA is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in
tthe direction of his fleeing companionsx97then sets off
tafter INDY.


<b>         
</b><b>tEXT. THE  CLIFFS - DAY
</b>
tINDY EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day.

tHe pausesx97squintsx97shields his eyesx97looks in all directions.

<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttMister Havelock! Anybody
ttEverybody's lost but me!

tHe hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER,
tHALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.

<b>tttFEDORA
</b>tt  There he isl                   

<b>       tttMEN
</b><b>tt      (AD-LIBS)
</b>ttLet's go! Let's get him! Let's
ttgo!

tIndy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy
tputs two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy
tputs the Cross in his belt.

tINDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But
tthe horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a
tstanding position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his
tback teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.

tFEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into
tthe saddle and gallop off.


<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b> tttINDY
</b>ttHyahl Hyah!

<b>                     
</b>
<b>                                    ttROSCOE
</b>ttHey! Come back here!

tFEDORA puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and A VINTAGE TRUCK
tAND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind the Pueblo (Driven by two
tmore gang members). Now we glimpse...


<b>tTHE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT
</b>
tThe passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm
tis out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from
tthe sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in
tthe truck.

<b>                                  ttPANAMA HAT
</b>ttCome on. Get him!

tINDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace
twith his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it.

tSpeeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched
tlow and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin
tpumping.

tINDY VEERS OFF in a new directionx97toward a RAILROAD TRACK.


<b>tEXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY
</b>
tThe train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over
this shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he
<b>tLEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.
</b>
tHe clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from
tthe truck onto the train.

tHALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed
truns after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked
ton a flatcar.

tINDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still
trunning after him, Indy enters the trap door of...


<b>tINT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY
</b>
tand finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling.
tSeveral feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles:
tAlligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc.


<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
tThen, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap doorx97followed by ROUGH RIDER.
tHalfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp.

tINDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at
tIndy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.

tThe combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended
tfor, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.

tEveryone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL
tBOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's
tend of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.

tHe lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye-
tto-eye with anx97

<b>tENORMOUS ANACONDA
</b>
tThe head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttOh...tt

tINDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttOh... Oh...

tHundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him.
tEngulf him. Almost smother him.

tINDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.

tINDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.

tHALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans.
tROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.

<b>tttROUGH RIDER
</b>ttHere, let me.



<b>tEXT. THE TRAIN- DAY
</b>
tINDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks
tworried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and
ttosses it away.

tROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at
thim. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to...

<b>tEXT. A FLATCAR - DAY
</b>
tINDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a
tlong stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto
tthe roof of the rhino boxcar.


<b>tINT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY
</b>
tas a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE
<b>tBLACK RHINOCEROS.
</b>

<b>tEXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY
</b>
tROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle,
trolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge.
tThings get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.


<b>tIN THE BOXCAR BELOW
</b>
t... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the
tcommotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS
<b>tHORN THROUGH THE ROOF.
</b>
<b>tBACK TO THE ROOFTOP
</b>
tas the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and
tRoscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle.
tSMASH! The horn comes up againx97RIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.

<b> tttINDY
</b>                   ttHoly smokes!
<b>                                    
</b>
tINDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from
tfalling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.


<b>tEXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY
</b>
tThe WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The
tdoor is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car.


<b>tEXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY
</b>
tINDY gets to his feetx97looks aheadx97sees a WATER TANK alongside the track
tdirectly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...

tIn an instant, he calculates his approachx97times the distancex97and LEAPS for
tthe tank's WATER SPOUT.


<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
tHe catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A
tFULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout
tdeposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks
tup to see FEDORA walking toward him.

<b>               tttFEDORA
</b>ttCome on, kid. There's no way
ttout of this.

tAs INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF
tCOLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.


<b>tINT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY
</b>
tINDY CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.

<b>tttINDY
</b>                  ttOhhh!                                   

tINDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in
tthrough the cracks between the boards.

tThen INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an
tAFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust
tswirls up into the shafts of sunlight.

tAnd INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged
tfrom his belt during the fall...

tINDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He
tcarefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.

tINDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP
tflying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.

tThe Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and
ttries again. This timex97success! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion
tBELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.

tINDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs
taway even more. Indy inches forwardx97bends down (never taking his eyes off
tthe Lion)x97picks up the Crossx97and steps back again, sweat pouring down his
tface.

tBut now... how to get out?

tHe looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING
tDOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.

<b>               tttFEDORA
</b>ttToss up the whip.

<b>tEXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR
</b>
tFEDORA, assisted by HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER, "reels" INDY out of the
tStockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy screams.

tThe men, including ROSCOE, pull INDY through the hole in the roof. He stands to
tface them as ROUGH RIDER points a gun in his direction.

<b>tttFEDORA
</b>         t tYou've got heart, kid.
tt       (indicates Cross)
ttBut that belongs to me.

<b>       tttINDY
</b>tt       (takes Cross from his belt)
ttIt belongs to Coronado.

<b>       tttFEDORA
</b>tt       (overlapping)
          ttCoronado is dead. And so are all
tthis grandchildren.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttThis should be in a museum.

<b>tttROSCOE
</b>          ttNow give me thatl

tROSCOE makes a grab for the Crossx97but INDY doesn't let go. A tug-of-war
tensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS
tAROUND Roscoe's hand.

tROSCOE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDERx97releases his grip on the Cross and tries
tto shake off the snake. This is all the opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO
<b>tTHE NEXT CAR.
</b>
<b>tttFEDORA
</b>          ttDon't let him get awayl

tINDY swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the caboose door reading
<b>t"DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE."
</b>
<b>tttINDY
</b>ttMagic?

tHe glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping
tinside.

tFEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.

<b>tttFEDORA
</b>          ttHold it. Make sure he doesn't
ttdouble back.

<b>tINT. THE CABOOSE - DAY
</b>
twhich contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. INDY rushes to the rear door of
tthe caboose but can't open it. He hears FEDORA coming, and dives into a MAGIC
<b>tBOX.
</b>
<b>               tttFEDORA
</b>ttOkay, kid. out of the box.
ttNow.

tFEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly
tcollapses; all four sides flop away... revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely
tvanished.

tFEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back.
tHe turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the
tbalcony and sees:

tINDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.


<b>tttFEDORA
</b>ttDamn.


<b>tEXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY
</b>
tas INDY runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name
t"JONES" painted on the mailbox.

<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttDad!

<b>tINT. THE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tINDY bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky
tBARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.

<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttDad!

<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttDad!

<b>tINT. THE STUDY - DAY
</b>
tINDY charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps
tclearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies.

tPROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very
tancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a
tbeautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window. The
tsketch incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just
tstudying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.


<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
We never get to see the PROFESSOR's face in this scene.
So INDY CHARGES IN.
<b>

<b>tttHENRY
</b>                 tt      (now he shouts)
ttJunior!

tNo question who is the boss here. INDY gulps, his look says "What am I going to
tdo with this guy?" And obeysx97
tstarts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttOne, two, three, four...

tNow we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand
tsketching; then, he holds up one finger.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttIn Greek.

tINDY's reaction:

<b>tttINDY
</b>                 tt     (louder, in Greek)
ttOne... two... three... four...

tAn ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps INDY glimpses it going past the
twindow. Anyway, it stops outside the house. Two men sit in the front seat.
tHERMAN sits in the rear, BLOWING A TRUMPET.

tINDY's reaction: Trouble!

tHENRY is just finishing the sketch.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttMay he who illuminated this...
ttilluminate me...

<b>tINT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe study door is just closing, INDY closing it behind him... just as HERMAN
tcomes through the front door, still playing the trumpet.

tINDY reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from HERMAN's mouth. Herman
tcontinues to spitx97right into Indy's face. Indy flinches.

<b>               tttHERMAN
</b>ttI brought the Sheriff.

tHERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.


<b>               tttINDY
</b>ttJust the man I want to see! Now,
ttthere were five or six of them.


<b>            tttSHERIFF

tThen, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat

tIt's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent STORM AT SEA.
tThirty-foot waves crash across the deck.

tThe TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back)
tpropel INDY across the deck toward the rail.

tAs they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, INDY uses the Two Sailors as leverage
tto KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on the metal bands that hold
tthe drums together.

tINDY jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors and rushes toward
tthe MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT.

tPANAMA HAT sees INDY coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to
tthe bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes
this way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder
tfrom behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the cross back from
tPanama Hat.

tA sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of
this grip and skittering across the deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two
tsailors who attack him from the sides.

tINDY sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it.

tHe SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave.
tHe struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the
tdeck around him.

tSEVERAL MORE DRUMS come INDY's way. He sidesteps them all.

<b>               tttPANAMA HAT
</b>ttGrab him, he's getting away!
ttGrab him!

tIndy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large
tStevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a
thold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly
tavoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still
tholding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly
tonto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending
tan enormous orange fireball into the sky.

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>ttThe last time I saw your father

tINDY can't take his eyes off ELSA. Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy
thimself right now. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal,
tIndy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.

tELSA leads INDY and BRODY into the large piazza. People walk about and sit at
ttables in front of a large building.

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>ttHere is the library.

tThey have arrived at the front steps of the library.

</b>ttThat doesn't look much like a

<b>tt               BRODY

tELSA leads the way inside.


<b>tINT. THE LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
tINDY, BRODY and ELSA enter, their heels CLICKING across the marble floor.

tWe notice, along with INDY and BRODY, that the library contains many stained-
tglass windows.

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>ttIn this case it's the literal

ttThese columns over here...

tShe indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling.

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>tt... were brought back as spoils
ttof war after the sacking of
ttByzantium during the Crusades.


<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
tINDY glances at the Columns, then notices a Stained-Glass Window that depicts a
tKnight of the Crusades. Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window.

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>ttNow please excuse me. The library's
ttclosing in a few moments. I'll
ttarrange for us to stay a little

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttMarcusx97I've seen this window
ttbefore.

<b>tttBRODY
</b>ttWhere?

tINDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the
tairplane.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttRight here. In Dad's Diary.
ttYou see?

tBRODY glances at the Diary, then at the windowx97noticing that the Roman
tnumerals in question have been worked into the window's design.

<b>t                                     BRODY

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttDad was onto something here!

<b>tt               BRODY
</b>ttWell, now we know the source of
ttthe numbers, but we still don't
ttknow what they mean.

tINDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back
tinto his pocket.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>tt      (explaining to Brody)
ttMy dad sent me this Diary for a
ttreason. Until we find out why,
ttI suggest we keep it to ourselves.

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>ttFind something?

tINDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving
tacross the walls and ceilingsx97charged with the thrill of discovery.

</b>
<b>tt               BRODY
</b>tt        (to ELSA)
ttUh, yes. Three, seven and tent
ttThat window seems to be the source

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>ttMy God, I must be blind

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttDad wasn't looking for a book

ttlooking for the Tomb itself

tELSA wears a blank expression.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttDon't you get it? The Tomb is
ttsomewhere in the library! You
ttsaid yourself it used to be a
ttchurch! Look.

tINDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttThree.

INDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.

<b> tt              INDY
</b>ttThree!

tINDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy
thurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep
tup with him.

<b>tt              INDY
</b>ttSeven.

tHe points again to the stained-glass window.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttSeven... Ten.

tHe looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttAnd ten. Now where's the ten?
ttLook around for the ten.

tINDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down.


<b>CONTINUED: (3)
</b>
<b>tttINDY
</b>ttThree, seven and ten.
<b>t
</b>tHe climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and
tELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge
t"X"x97visible only from this higher angle.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttTen.
tt      (wryly; to himself)
tt"X" marks the spot.

tINDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two
tsides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up,
tbut cannot.

tINDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath
tthe stained-glass window.

tINDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the
tLibrarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously.
<b>t
</b>tINDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still
tpuzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library.

tFinally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a
<b>tTWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED.
</b>
tCold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttBingo.

<b>tttELSA
</b>ttYou don't disappoint, Doctor Jones.
ttYou're a great deal like your
ttfather.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttExcept he's lost, and I'm not.

<b>tttELSA
</b>ttLower me down.

tINDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeablyx97holding her by
tthe hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground
tbelow, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY.
<b>t
</b><b>tttINDY
</b>ttLook after this for me, will you?

tThen INDY disappears into the hole.

<b>tINT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
tINDY jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help ELSA.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttCome on.

tINDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank.
tfoul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory
tfour-leaf clover design.

tINDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls.

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>ttPagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth
ttCentury.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttRight. Six hundred years before
ttthe Crusades.

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>ttThe Christians would have dug
tttheir own passages and burial
ttchambers centuries later.

tINDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttThat's right. If there's a
ttKnight of the First Crusade
ttentombed down here, that's where
ttwe'll find him.


<b>tINT. LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
tTHREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an
tunsuspecting BRODY. One of the Men, KAZIM, raises his gun and brings it down
thard on Brody's head.

<b>tt               BRODY
</b>ttOhhhh. . .

tKAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two
tmen take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles.

<b>tINT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS - DAY
</b>
tDECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone walls. Grotesque
tskeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones.

tINDY holds the lighter up as he and ELSA inspect symbols carved into the walls.


<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
tELSA spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize. As she blows
taway some cobwebs:

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>ttWhat's this one?

tINDY only has to give it a quick glance to know.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttThe Ark of the Covenant.

<b>tttELSA
</b>ttAre you sure?

<b>tttINDY
</b>tt      (deadpan)
ttPretty sure.

tINDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway.

<b>tANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
</b>
tINDY steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He scrapes the cobwebs
taway to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL "X."

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttWatch out.

tELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall
tcollapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room.


<b>tANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS
</b>
tas INDY falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling,
tgreen, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches.
tELSA holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttPetroleum. I could sink a well
ttdown here and retire.

tINDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which
tbreaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water.

tINDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then
tdips into the oily water.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttGive me the lighter.

<b>tANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
</b>
tUsing the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, INDY and ELSA come
tupon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-deep and TEEMING WITH
tRATS. Thousands of them Crawling on one another's backs. SQUEALING.
tSquirming. Thrashing in the water.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttOh, rats...

tELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.

tINDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping
tin horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out
tto Elsa.

<b>tt              INDY
</b>ttCome onl

tShe gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves
tforward.


<b>tTHE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL
</b>
tKAZIM and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their
tflashlights through to the rat-infested water.

<b>tANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
</b>
tMore rat-infested water as ELSA, now walking again, follows INDY through
tanother passageway lined with skulls and bones.

tINDY reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A
tbone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all
tdirections.

tHe takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to ELSA's
tside. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttCome here.

<b>tLARGE BURIAL CHAMBER
</b>
tThe chamber is flooded with black, briny water.
<b>ttt
</b><b>tttINDY
</b>ttLook. . .

tIn the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an
t"island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the
taltar.


<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
tINDY and ELSA begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of
tantiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of
tetched brass.

<b>tt             INDY
</b>ttIt must be one of these...

<b>tt             ELSA

tslides away and BANGS against the stone platform.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttIt's a rubbing Dad made of the

tPULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick
twater.


<b>tINDY AND ELSA
</b>
tELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And
tthen he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls.

tThis is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the
tNarrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDYx97SHRIEKING and
tSQUEALING as they approach.

tThe rats literally wash over themx97like a rodent tidal wavex97in their efforts to
tescape a:

<b>tHUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE
</b>
tROARING around the corner hurtling towards themx97feeding on the oil slick;

</b>
<b>t                                     INDY
</b>ttGet back! Back against the wall.

tINDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet.
tIt CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water.

<b>t                                     INDY

<b>t                                     INDY
</b>ttAir pocket!

tELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath.


<b>tUNDER THE COFFIN
</b>
tELSA surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and
<b>tSPITTING.
</b>
tNow INDY pops up into the air pocket. He looks at ELSAx97they are both soaking
twet.

<b>tt           tINDY
</b>ttDon't wander off.

<b>tttELSA
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tUNDER THE WATER
</b>
tINDY swims, looking for an escape route.

<b>tUNDER THE COFFIN
</b>
tThe rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water
tand climbing on ELSA, who squirms and screams in terror.

tINDY pops back up through the water.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttI think I've found a way out.
ttDeep breath.

tELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water.


<b>tEXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY
</b>
tThe perfect picture postcardx97St. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond.
tCafe customers are startled to see INDY and ELSA climb out of the sewer, wet

<b>                  tttINDY

ttAh, Venicel

tIndy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH
tAGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns.

tHe grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP
<b>tINTO A MOTORBOAT.
</b>

<b>tINT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY
</b>
tINDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a
tTurkish Agent JUMPS in with him.

tELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade
tpunches.

<b>tEXT. THE HARBOR - DAY
</b>
tIndy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in the direction of
tthe DOCKED STEAMSHIP.

tKAZIM and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the dock.

tThey chase after INDY.

tINDY grapples with the Turkish Agent. As Indy grips his arms, we SEE a GUN in
tthe Agent's hand. It FIRES.

tAs INDY fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the Speedboats behind him
tand two enormous Freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes.

tINDY, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent.

<b>tttINDY
</b>tt      (to ELSA)
ttAre you crazy?! You don't go

tELSA can barely hear INDY over the noise of the motor.

<b>t                                      ELSA
</b>ttGo between them? Are you crazy?!

tINDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard.
tTurning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN
tthe two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttI said go around!

<b>tttELSA
</b>ttYou said go between them!

tIndy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the Enemy
tSpeedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between the two Freighters, FLYING INTO
tTHE AIR and SPLASHING back down into the water.

<b>tINDY AND ELSA
</b>
tspin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear
tracing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at
tINDY and ELSA.


<b>tKAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT

</b>tmatches Indy's move for move.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE HARBOR
</b>
tThe two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A CHATTERING
tMACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood of Indy's boat, until
tfinally the rear of the boat CATCHES ON FIRE.

tThe machine gun runs out of ammunition. KAZIM puts it down and takes control
tof the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents in the boat with him.

tAs Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS at the STERN of
tANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. INDY
tsteps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then
tturns his attention to KAZIM. The two men trade punches as the boat spins
thelplessly in the churning water.

<b>tttELSA
</b>ttNo!!

tINDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back
tinto the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the
tSteamer's giant propeller blades.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttWhy are you trying to kill us?

<b>tt               KAZIM
</b>ttBecause you're looking for the

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttMy father was looking for the

</b>ttThen we'll die.

<b>tt               KAZIM
</b>ttMy soul is prepared. How's yours?

tBy now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are
tgetting closer.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttThis is your last chance.

<b>tt               KAZIM
</b>ttNo, Doctor Jones. It's yours!

tThe wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and
tjumps... into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of
ttime.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttAll right! Where's my father

<b>tt               KAZIM
</b>ttIf you let me go, I will tell you

<b>tt               KAZIM
</b>ttMy name is Kazim.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttAnd why were you trying to kill

<b>tt               KAZIM
</b>ttThe secret of the Grail has been
ttsafe for a thousand years. And
ttfor all that time the Brotherhood
ttof the Cruciform Sword has been
ttprepared to do anything to keep
ttit safe.

tKAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? Whatever it
tis, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of
ta broadsword.

<b>tt               KAZIM
</b>ttLet me get off at this jetty.

tThe boat is close to the edge of the canal. INDY gives ELSA a nod, telling her to
tbring the boat in. KAZIM steps ashore.

<b>tt               KAZIM

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttI didn't come for the Cup of

tINDY reacts to the sight of them.

<b>tttINDY
</b>tt        (to ELSA; softly)
ttNazis. I hate these guys.

tThe room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks
tout. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each windowx97

tTHROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise.


<b>tINT. THE ROOM - DAY

twe think he's going to use it on his dad.

tHe opens a door and enters:

</b>

tINDY and HENRY rush back into the room where ELSA had been left, only to
tfind: A Nazi COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.

tHis name is VOGEL: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. One arm is wrapped
taround Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a LUGER behind her
tear.

<b>tt               VOGEL
</b>ttThat's far enough Put down the

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttWait!  Waitl

tAnd then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides
tacross, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly.

tVOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled
tdirectly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest.

<b>t                                     ELSA

tand ELSA and TWO NAZI GUARDS.

tELSA crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. INDY and
tHENRY do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They
tonly see a HAND REACH OUT AND TAKE THE BOOK.

tINDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through
tthe opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.

tHENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any

<b>tt               HENRY
</b>ttThat's for blasphemy. The quest

tThe mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College
tStudents and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire.

tFlags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically
tfrom side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous
tcrowd.

tINDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi
tSoldier. He is now buttoning up the tunicx97which happens to be several sizes
ttoo big.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttMy boy, we are Pilgrims in an

tthey oversee the rally.


<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tELSA is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi
tOfficers... one of whom is now none other than INDY, coming up to her before she
tknows he is there. His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.

tShe understands him. It's as though he slapped her.

<b>tt               ELSA
</b>ttIs that what you think of me?
ttI believe in the Grail, not the
ttSwastika.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttAll I have to do is squeeze.

<b>tttELSA
</b>ttAll I have to do is scream.

tIt's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And
tthe same goes for screaming.

tINDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He
tmoves over to HENRY.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttI've got it. Let's get the hell

tThey move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage
tcoming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's
tsignature.

tHITLER pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. It
tonly lasts a moment but the moment is electric.

tHITLER breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first
tpage and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on.

<b>tt             VOGEL
</b>ttNicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!

</b>

tA STEWARD enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of INDY and
tHENRY, then continues down the aisle of passengers. Indy follows after the
tSteward. He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk
tup a flight of stairs.

tVOGEL glances up and recognizes INDYx97who quickly punches Vogel in the face,

tThe tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan
tbecoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of
tthe six-pound cannon on the turret.

tINDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of

tINDY loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of
this leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending
tstones tumbling down over him.


<b>tINT. TANK - DAY
</b>
tThe NAZI SOLDIER knocks HENRY into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the
tface.

tAs the SOLDIER raises the gun to HENRY's face, BRODY hits him over the head
twith a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air.

tThe BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is
tmanipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; then the BULLET PINGS
tAGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE MORE, this time passing THROUGH
tTHE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver
tslumps forward, his body depressing the levers.


<b>tEXT. TANK - DAY
</b>
tINDY still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely
tmissing the rocks and causing VOGEL to fall. Indy finally manages to pull
thimself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then
tpeers down to HENRY, still inside the tank.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttDad?

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttYou call this archaeology?

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttGet out of there, Dad!

tINDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the
ttank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs
tVogel's arm.

<b>tttBRODY
</b>ttHow does one get off this thing?

tAs INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the
tbackswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down.

</b>
<b>tttHENRY
</b>tt        (to INDY)
ttWhere's Marcus?!

tBefore INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks
tbut the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving
ttread.

tINDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside.

tAs HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with
tlightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around
tHenry's right ankle.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttDad!

tHENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto
tthe end of the bullwhip.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttHang on, Dad!

tSALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY.

<b>tt               SALLAH
</b>ttFather of Indyx97give me your

tVOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still,
tINDY refuses to let go of the whip.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttSallah! Get Dadl

tSALLAH reaches out to HENRY.

<b>tt               SALLAH
</b>ttGive me your hand!

tSALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the
tcliff's edge.

tINDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away
tfrom Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head.


<b>tINDY
</b>
tlooks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror.  We SEE his
tHAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge.

<b>tVOGEL
</b>
tHe sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top
tof his lungs!


<b>tLONG SHOT

tThe tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM.

<b>tt               HENRY
</b>ttOh, God. I've lost him. And I

tAnd then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM.
tHe joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below
twith a bewildered expression.

tFinally, Henry becomes aware of his presence.

tHENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he
tthrows his arms around him.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttI thought I'd lost you, boy.

tAfter a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's
tembrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long timex97if ever. And it touches him.
tHe hugs his father back.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttI thought you had too, sir.

tBRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttWellx97well done! Come on!

tHENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff
tedge.



<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
tUnaware, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY start to walk away. Henry turns back to
tsee INDY still sitting on the ground.

<b>tttDONOVAN
</b>ttThe Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

tNow ELSA peers through the binoculars.


<b>tEXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY
</b>
tINDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY ride into the canyon. They hear a WAILING
tWIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the danger.

tNow we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its spectacular Grecian
tfacade is carved directly into the rock. It is a stunning sight. The vehicles,
tcamels and horses belonging to DONOVAN's party have been left at the entrance.

</b>
tINDY, SALLAH, HENRY AND BRODY creep forward to see:

</b>
tHe's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under his breath.
tWhat's going on here?


<b>tFULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE
</b>
tTHE TURK stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is very dark. GIANT
tCOLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter.

<b>tELSA AND DONOVAN
</b>
twatch him from a safe distance.

<b>tTHE TURK
</b>
tis about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't

tTHE TURK stopsx97only one step away from the beheaded soldier.


<b>tTHE TURK
</b>
ttakes one more stepx97a fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROARx97A WHOOSH
tof airx97but we SEE NOTHINGx97except THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND
tBOUNCE across the ground.


<b>tINDY, HENRY, BRODY AND SALLAH
</b>
treact to the sight.


<b>tELSA AND DONOVAN
</b>
tShe looks at him, horrified.


<b>tttDONOVAN
</b>ttHelmut, another volunteer!

tTWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...


tThe SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and
this party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns.


<b>tFULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE
</b>
tINDY, HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers.


tELSA's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues
tmore coldly.

<b>tttELSA
</b>tt       (to INDY)
ttI never expected to see you again.

<b>tt                INDY
</b>ttI'm like a bad penny. I always

<b>tt                DONOVAN
</b>ttStep back now, Doctor Schneider.
ttGive Doctor Jones some room. He's

</b>
tINDY laughs.

<b>tt               DONOVAN
</b>ttImpossible? What do you say,

</b>ttAs what? A Nazi stooge like you?

<b>tttDONOVAN
</b>tt       (scornfully)

ttWell, they're welcome. But I want
ttthe Grail itself. The cup that
ttgives everlasting life.
ttHitler can have the world, but

</b>ttShooting me won't get you anywhere.

<b>tt               DONOVAN
</b>ttYou know something, Doctor Jones?...

tThen DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters
this side below the ribs.

</b>ttJunior. . .

<b>tttELSA
</b>ttNo!!

<b>tttDONOVAN

</b>

tINDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes.

tDONOVAN points the gun at him:

<b>tttDONOVAN
</b>ttYou can't save him when you're
ttdead.

tINDY hesitates.

<b>tt               DONOVAN
</b>ttThe healing power of the Grail is
ttthe only thing that can save your
ttfather now. It's time to ask yourself
ttwhat you believe.

tINDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of
thim. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent
treaction shotsx97ELSAx97SALLAHx97BRODYx97DONOVANx97registering their
tdifferent emotions

tINDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.

<b>tt               INDY

<b>tt               INDY
</b>tt"The penitent man will pass.
ttThe penitent man..."

tINDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.

tHENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>tt        (in a raspy voice)
tt"Only the penitent man will pass.

ttThe penitent man will pass. The

</b>ttThe penitent man. The penitent...

tINDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs.

</b>

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttThe penitent man is humble before
ttGod.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttPenitent. Penitent...

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttThe penitent man is humble...

tThe cobwebs begin to move....

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttHe kneels before God.
tt       (to himself; suddenly)
ttKneel!!

tWe hear the awful rush of airx97WHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of
tkneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face.

tInstinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up.
tFrom his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR
<b>tSHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM.
</b>
tINDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a
tSMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden
twheels turnx97the mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope
taround the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttI'm through!

</b>
<b>tttDONOVAN
</b>ttWe're through!

tBRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.

ttHe's all right.

tHENRY shakes his head.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttNo.

<b>tBACK TO INDY
</b>
tholding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.


<b>tttINDY
</b>tt"The second challenge is the

tINDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is
tengraved with a letter.

<b>tttINDY
</b>tt"Proceed in the footsteps of the
ttWord."



<b>tHENRY
</b>
tlifts his head painfully.

</b>ttThe Word of God...



<b>tttBRODY
</b>ttNo, Henry. Try not to talk.


<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttThe Name of God...

tas he studies the cobblestones before him.


<b>tttINDY
</b>ttThe Name of God... Jehovahl



<b>tHENRY
</b>
tstill lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him.


<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttBut in the Latin alphabet,
tt"Jehovah" begins with an "I."


<b>tBACK TO INDY
</b>

<b>tttINDY
</b><b>tt"J."
</b>
tINDY takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and INDY falls up to his
thip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.

<b>tHENRY
</b>
treacts.


<b>tt               HENRY
</b>ttOh dear!

<b>tBACK TO INDY

<b>tt               INDY
</b>ttIn Latin, "Jehovah" starts with

tNow we SEE each letter on the stones as INDY carefully walks forward.
tDONOVAN and ELSA follow in his footsteps.

<b>tttINDY
</b><b>tt"E"... "H"... "O"... "V"... "A"...
</b>

tINDY sighs with relief and steps forward to:


<b>tTHE GREAT ABYSS
</b>
tINDY stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze
tthrough and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across,
tnothing but a rough, stony cliff wall.


<b>tBACK TO INDY
</b>
tHe can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the v-rail Diary.

<b>tt               INDY
</b>tt"The path of flood. Only in the
ttleap from the lion's head will
tthe prove his worth."

tINDY looks around and then he notices that inscribed into
tthe rock above his head is the head of a lion.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttImpossiblel Nobody can jump this!

tINDY looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it
tis asking him to do.


<b>tBRODY
</b>
trushes forward and calls to INDY.

<b>tttBRODY
</b>ttIndy... Indy, you must hurry!!
ttCome quickly!

<b>tBACK TO INDY
</b>
<b>tttINDY
</b>tt     (realizing)
ttIt's... a leap of faith. Oh,
ttGod.

<b>tHENRY
</b>
tcalls to his son.


<b>tt               HENRY
</b>ttYou must believe, boy. you must...
ttbelieve.

tWe see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We
tsee that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is
tgoing to fall 100 feet to his death. And thenx97he doesn't! He appears to be held
tup by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.

tINDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.

tIngeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks
t100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with
tlines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet
tare stepping.

tIt's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage... in
tperfect alignment with everything we see below.

tWhen INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect
talignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and
the crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.

tIndy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.

tA vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a
thundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all
tglitter and shine.

tINDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that
ta man is praying at the altarl

tHe has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL
<b>tKNIGHT.
</b>

<b>tCLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT
</b>
tBut we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down.
tPerhaps we see his eyes.



<b>CONTINUED:
</b>
tWhen the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly,
tprepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at
tIndy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too
tmuch. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt
tto fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy
tapproaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient
tman.

<b>tt               KNIGHT
</b>ttI knew you'd come, but my strength

<b>tt               INDY

<b>tt               INDY

<b>tt               KNIGHT
</b>ttI was chosen because I was the

tThe GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.

<b>tttINDY
</b>tt      (gulp)
ttListen, I don't have time to

<b>tt               DONOVAN
</b>ttThank you, Doctor.

tELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.

tELSA chooses a cupx97a solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.

tDONOVAN instantly takes it from her.

<b>tt               DONOVAN
</b>ttOh, yes. It's more beautiful than

ttis the cup of the King of Kings.

tDONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.

<b>tttDONOVAN
</b>ttEternal life!

tDONOVAN drinks from the goblet.

tThen, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He
tgrabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.

<b>tt               DONOVAN
</b>ttWhat . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . .

tHe starts to agex97fast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks.

tHis skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits.
tHis skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.

</b>ttThere's only one way to find out.

tINDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses.
tINDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.

tA strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we
tsee his wounds begin to heal.

<b>t                                    KNIGHT
</b>t            You have chosen wisely. But the

tCUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.

tINDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.

tThe TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put

tHENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.

tHENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his
tmouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in
tastonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The
tcolor returns to Henry's face.

</b>ttElsa, don't cross the Seal. The
ttKnight warned us not to take the
ttGrail from here.

tA RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from
tthe ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away
tfrom her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT
tOPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams.

tELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach.
tAs her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself
tsliding forward across the slanted floor.

<b>t                                     HENRY
</b>ttJunior!  Junior!

tWith her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless
tshe gives him her free hand. She has to choose.

<b>tttINDY
</b>ttElsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa.
ttGive me your other hand,
tthoney. I can't hold you.

</b>

</b>ttI can reach it. I can reach it...

tHer hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.

<b>tt                INDY
</b>ttElsa! Give me your hand. Give
ttme your other hand!

tELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too
tfarx97INDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to
ther death.

<b>tttINDY
</b>tt     (horrified)
ttElsa!!

tNow the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his
thands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttJunior, give me your other hand!
ttI can't hold on!!

<b>tt                INDY

tINDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing
tcan ever be retrieved.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttIndiana. Indiana!!

tINDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before.


<b>tttHENRY
</b>tt     (very calmly)
tt... let it go...


tINDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands.
tHENRY pulls him up to safety.

tfrom the crumbling Temple.

tINDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles
tdown upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he
twatches them leave.

tINDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY emerge from the Mountain Temple through
tthe Grecian Facade.

tFrom within the Mountain Temple, the ROAR OF WALLS CAVING IN IS HEARD. A
tcloud of dust and smoke billows out from the entrance.

tHENRY turns to INDY.

<b>tttHENRY
</b>ttElsa never really believed in the
ttGrail. She thought she'd found a
ttprize.
