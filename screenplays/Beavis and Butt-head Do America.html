</b>tby
<b>t
</b>tMike Judge and Joe Stillman
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b>ttThe movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror 
tand running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from 
twhat seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building 
tdebris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines 
tcoming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much 
tlike a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the 
tfootsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more 
tintense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS 
tSHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan 
tup, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-
tshirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a 
thuge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt-
tKong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and 
tbuildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh."
ttAirplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). 
tHe looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head 
tswats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and 
tstomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head 
treaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a 
tlot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in 
this hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman 
tscreams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few 
tlame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh 
thuh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, 
t"Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames. 
tWe CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice 
tgiant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank 
taround. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT 
tBEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more 
tdestructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). 
tBeavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head 
tputs the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling 
tthe city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.
ttWe CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking 
tButt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking 
thim.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  B&B'S HOME - DAY
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS (O.C.)
</b>tttButt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!
<b>t
</b>tButt-Head is dead asleep on the couch. Beavis shakes him.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttButt-Head, wake up, wake up!
<b>t
</b>tButt-Head comes around.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttDammit, Beavis, I was about to score.
tttHuh huh.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttYeah, but check it out. It's gone!
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttWhat's gone?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttThe TV.
<b>t
</b>tBeavis is making STRANGE NOISES, in a state of shock.
<b>t
</b>tButt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the TV 
twas.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttUuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,...
<b>t
</b>tOut the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&B's TV into their 
tvan.
<b>t
</b>tStill on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We 
tsee a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open.
<b>t
</b>tButt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN 
tDOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this 
ta couple of times - piecing it all together.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
</b>tttWhoa! I think I just figured something
tttout Beavis.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttWhat?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttThis sucks.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttYeah, heh heh.
<b>t
</b>tBeavis is still in shock. They both stare at the empty space where 
tthe TV was for a beat, not quite sure what to do.
<b>t
</b>tBeavis is SHAKING AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES. He presses buttons on 
tthe remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttThis sucks more than anything that
ttthas ever sucked before. We must find
tttthis butt-hole that took the TV.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tBad neighborhood. 70's music blares.
<b>t
</b>tA fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in 
tfear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms, 
tchain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes 
toff his glasses.
<b>t
</b><b>tFREEZE ON BEAVIS
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttttANNOUNCER
</b>tttBeavis!
<b>t
</b>tFRAME UNFREEZES. Beavis whips out a huge gun.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttFreeze, butt-wipe!
<b>t
</b>tAn attacker comes from one side. Beavis uses Judo. Another tosses 
ta knife. Beavis ducks, then shoots with two hands, police style.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tSwinger's pad. Totally 70's. A group of bikini'd girls on a 
twaterbed. Butt-Head approaches them. He wears a leisure suit, 
tcollar way open. He plops down in the bed.
<b>t
</b><b>tFREEZE ON BUTT-HEAD
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttttANNOUNCER
</b>tttButt-Head!
<b>t
</b>tFRAME UNFREEZES. The girls wrap their arms around him.

</b>tttHuh huh huh. Come to Butt-Head, baby.

</b><b>tttttANNOUNCER
</b>tttStar in...
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tMAIN TITLE - FULL FRAME
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  CITY STREETS - DAY/NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tACTION MONTAGE BEGINS. Styled like a 70's cop show opening.
<b>t
</b>tOPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits 
twould.
<b>t
</b>tBeavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun.
<b>t
</b>tButt-Head slaps a pimp.
<b>t
</b>tBeavis drives, chasing a car.
<b>t
</b>tButt-Head is slapped by a girl.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttHuh huh huh. That was cool.
<b>t
</b>tBeavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out.
<b>t
</b>tA black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&B.
<b>t
</b>tB&B dive for cover just before a building explodes.
<b>t
</b>tIn CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot.
<b>t
</b>tButt-Head does the same.
<b>t
</b>tBeavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge.
<b>t
</b>tA beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head. 
tFINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into 
tbed. Suddenly...
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY/DOOR TO A.V. ROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tFrom inside, SOUND of equipment crashing.
<b>t
</b>tB&B come out wheeling a TV on one of those carts. There are cables 
tattached to it still leading back into the A.V. room. As they push 
tthe cart we hear more equipment falling.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttDammit, it's stuck.
<b>t
</b>tThey give it one big push and it finally breaks free. We see that 
tthe cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which 
tall come crashing to the ground.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
</b>tttHuh huh huh. That was cool.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttYeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this
tttthing back to the house.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  SCHOOL/ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tMR. VAN DRIESSEN stops B&B.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttVAN DRIESSEN
</b>tttAh, excuse me boys. What's going on
ttthere?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttUh, someone stole our TV.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttYeah. We're just gonna use this one.
tttGet outta the way. Heh heh.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttVAN DRIESSEN
</b>tttI'm afraid that TV belongs to the school.
tttMmmkay? You know, this could be a positive
tttexperience for you guys. There's a
tttwonderful world out there when we discover
tttwe don't need TV to entertain us.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttHuh huh huh. He said "anus."
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>ttttt(to himself)
tttEntert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh 
tttheh. Anus. Heh heh.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttVAN DRIESSEN

tttHave you guys heard a word I've said?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttYeah, "anus." Huh huh huh huh.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttVAN DRIESSEN
</b>tttLook, guys, just take the TV back to the
tttA.V. room right now. And try to be a little
tttmore open-minded. Mmkay?
<b>t
</b>tVan Driessen leaves. B&B continue to wheel the cart home.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttWhat a dork. Huh huh.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttYeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  SCHOOL/STAIRWAY - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tB&B arrive with the cart at the top of a stairway. They lamely 
tattempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy 
tand goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttHuh huh huh. That was cool.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttNo it wasn't!
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttUh,...Oh yeah.
<b>t
</b>tB&B stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage. 
tPRINCIPAL McVICKER shows up by the TV.
<b>t
</b>tttttMcVICKER
tttWhy.... You... You bastards... Ge...
tttget out! You're suspended. One more
tttscrew up... and you're expelled.
<b>t
</b>tB&B walk off laughing.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  THE ANDERSON'S DRIVEWAY - DUSK
</b><b>t
</b>tB&B walk up. There's a camper in the driveway.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttWhoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't
tttknow Anderson had a Camper.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttYeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV.
tttHeh heh. TV.
<b>t
</b>tB&B walk up to the camper and start to open the door just as MARCY 
tANDERSON opens it. (As usual, she doesn't recognize them.)
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMARCY
</b>tttOh, hello. Are you guys here to look
tttat the refrigerator?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttUh, no.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttWe're here to look at the TV. Heh heh.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMARCY
</b>tttOh, I didn't realize it was broken.
tttCome on in.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttCool. Huh huh huh.
<b>t
</b>tB&B walk into the camper. Marcy stays outside.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - SAME TIME
</b><b>t
</b>tTom is adjusting the trailer-hitch. Marcy watches.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTOM
</b>tttWell that oughtta hold her. Ya know,
tttthe most important thing you can have
ttton a camper is a good propane regulator,
tttand this here's the best one they make.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMARCY
</b>tttI sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed
tttbefore we leave.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTOM
</b>tttNow Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip
tttour whole lives and we're gonna go come
tttHell or high water...
<b>t
</b>tThrough the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of B&B 
<b>tAIR/MOUTH-GUITARING "IRON MAN."
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttttTOM (CONT.)
</b>tttWhat the hell is that noise?
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
</b><b>t
</b>tB&B watch a "Cops"-type show. Beavis gets up, goes to the 
trefrigerator and grabs a soda. The refrigerator is under the 
tcounter on which the TV is sitting.
<b>t
</b>tBeavis takes a sip and then does a SPIT TAKE, SPRAYING SODA ALL 
<b>tOVER THE TOP OF THE TV.
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttAAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!
<b>t
</b>tANGLE ON TV: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the inside of the 
tTV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX. The TV 
tgoes dead.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttBeavis, you butt-hole! You broke it.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
</b><b>t

<b>t
</b><b>tttttTOM
</b>tttHey, what's goin' on here?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMARCY
</b>tttThey're here to fix the TV, Tom.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTOM
</b>tttThe TV ain't broken.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttYeah it is. Huh huh huh.
<b>t
</b>tTom adjusts his glasses as he looks at B&B.
<b>t
</b>tTOM'S BLURRY P.O.V.: We see B&B out of focus.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTOM
</b>tttHey wait a minute. You two look kinda
tttfamiliar. Ain't you them kids that've
tttbeen whackin' off in my tool shed?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD
</b>tttHuh huh huh huh huh.
<b>t
</b>tANGLE ON BEAVIS: looking particularly guilty, eyes shifting back 
tand forth.
<b>t
</b>tB&B walk off, leaving Tom wondering.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  STREET IN A SEEDY PART OF TOWN - JUST BEFORE DAWN
</b><b>t
</b>tB&B are having TV withdrawal. Butt-Head is bug-eyed. Beavis has 
tthe shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight 
tCowboy."
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttNnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttWhat's your problem Beavis?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttI need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
<b>t
</b>tButt-Head stops short. He looks up. His face is bathed in a 
tgolden, throbbing light.
<b>t
</b>tBUTT-HEAD'S P.O.V.: We see a flashing neon sign that says, "TV". 
tPull back to show B&B are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge, 
tfeaturing "Color TV" and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap 
tRates."
<b>t
</b>tB&B stare up, as if at a god.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>ttttt(crazed)
tttHeh heh. TV. Heh Teee Veee.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  MOTEL COURT - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>t
</b>tButt-Head tries the first door. It's locked. He tries the second 
tdoor. It's locked. He tries the third door. It opens.
<b>t
</b>tB&B's eyes bulge. Inside, PRINCIPAL McVICKER is lying across the 
tlegs of an obvious prostitute, his pants pulled down. She SPANKS 
thim.
<b>t
</b>tttttMcVICKER
tttPlease mmm... may I have another?!
<b>t
</b>tB&B LAUGH. McVicker hears and looks up.
<b>t
</b>tttttMcVICKER (CONT.)
tttBeavis and Butt-Head! Y...y...you
tttbastards.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttCan we watch your TV?
<b>t
</b>tttttMcVICKER
tttY... Y... You're expelled! Get out!
<b>t
</b>tButt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards 
tthe next door. The muffled sound of a SPANK can be heard followed 
tby McVicker asking for another.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttHuh huh huh. That was cool.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttDammit! I need a TV now! We're missing
ttteverything!
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b><b>t
</b>tThe only light in the room is a flickering TV. Sitting on the bed, 
ttalking on the phone is MUDDY. He's a tough, mean looking red-neck 
t- a Jack Ruby type.
<b>t
</b>tOn the nightstand next to him is a three-quarter drunk bottle of 
tbourbon and a manila envelope. On his lap is a big gun.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMUDDY
</b>ttt...Are you sure these guys can pull this
tttoff? It's gotta look like an accident...
<b>t
</b>tWe hear a knock on the door and muffled B&B laughs.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMUDDY (CONT.)
</b>tttHold on a minute. That must be them now.
tttI'll call you back. (Hangs up phone)...
tttCome in!
<b>t
</b>tB&B walk in. Muddy turns on the light.
<b>t

tttAaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMUDDY
</b>tttYer late.
<b>t

tttDo her? Huh huh.

tttUh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMUDDY
</b>tttOkay, then let's get down to business.
<b>t
</b>tANGLE ON THE BED. Muddy slaps down a picture of DALLAS, his wife. 
tLeather clad, biker, beautiful.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMUDDY (CONT.)
</b>tttHere she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't
tttas sweet as she looks. She stole everything
tttfrom me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll

</b>tIn an overhead view, the four-by-four screeches up to the gate, 
tfishtails to a stop, throwing B&B onto the sidewalk, and peels 
taway.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttWe're gonna get paid to score.

</b>tttBeavis, this is the greatest day of

<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  AIRPLANE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tB&B enter the plane. They sit down in the first two seats on the 
tright - in First Class. A flight attendant, DOLORIS approaches 
tthem.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDOLORIS
</b>tttHi. Can I help you find your seats?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttUuh, nah. These seats are OK.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDOLORIS
</b>tttI think your tickets have you seated
tttin row fourteen, coach. So why don't
tttyou just go ahead and move back, OK?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttThat's OK. Someone else can have those.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttYeah, it's not that important to me,
tttreally. Those seats are too small anyways.
<b>t
</b>tDoloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the 
taisle.
<b>t
</b>tANGLE DOWN AISLE in coach. Doloris stops by a row where an elderly 
twoman, MARTHA, sits by the window. Next to her: Two empty seats.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDOLORIS
</b>tttHere you are.
<b>t
</b>tShe gestures to the seats and leaves. Beavis climbs in the middle, 
tButt-Head in the aisle - still watching Doloris.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBUTT-HEAD
</b>tttHey Beavis. When she was leading us down
ttthere, huh huh, she touched my butt. Huh
ttthuh huh.
<b>t
</b>tMartha, her senses a bit dimmed from age, turns to B&B.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMARTHA

<b>t
</b>tButt-Head is staring at the Dumb Guy in admiration. Beavis, like 
tthe Dumber Guy, appears to be just staring at the fire,

tttIt's like a really long time ago...

<b>t

</b>ttt...and... Whoa!...and it's like there's
tttall these weird shapes and it's sort of
tttlike,...it's like...like a MUSIC VIDEO!!!
<b>t
</b>tTight on Beavis' face staring in wonder.
<b>t
</b>tTHIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It 
tcould even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the 
tlower left hand corner.
<b>t
</b>tI would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of 
tsomething like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This 
tis the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you... 
tfire!"
<b>t
</b>tThe concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but 
tI would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White 
tZombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.)
<b>t
</b><b>tBEAVIS' P.O.V.:
</b><b>t
</b>tWe see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire. 
tThe ball of fire develops a face and speaks.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttFIRE
</b>tttI am God of Hellfire and I bring
tttyou...(music begins) Fire...
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEAVIS
</b>tttWhoa!!! This kicks ass!!!
<b>t
</b>tTHIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball 
tof fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini.
<b>t
</b>tAt first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in 
tbikinis and various images of B&B's TV in all its glory.
<b>t
</b>tAs the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass 
tof naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&B head-banging, weird 
tstuff from my high school notebooks, etc.
<b>t
</b>tAt one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform.
<b>t
</b>tAs the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the 
tsurreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as 
tmaybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the 
tmovie.)
<b>t
</b>tThen, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&B's near-dead 
tbodies.
<b>t
</b>tThe SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&B. REVEAL they were not 
tfar from the side of a road all along.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttB&B
</b>tttAhhhhghhhhgh!
<b>t
</b>tB&B snap out of it. They rise and find Muddy hovering over them 
twith a shotgun.

</b>tttAagh! I'm all wet!...(realizing) Oh, cool.
tttHeh heh heh. Water.
<b>t
</b>tMuddy aims his shotgun at B&B.
