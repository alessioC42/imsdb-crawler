tttStay away from here!
<b>t
</b>tWe're watching A VIDEO MONITOR. A pre-recorded tape shows
ta view of what is obviously a pristine-RESEARCH LABORATORY.
tDR. JOHN MARCUS, in a lab coat, faces THE CAMERA, disheveled

tttThis lab must remain sealed!
<b>t
</b><b>tINT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS
</b><b>t
</b>tOverhead lamps cast pools of LIGHT down onto A CONFERENCE
tTABLE, onto THE HANDS of PEOPLE assembled to observe the
tvideo. We see NO FACES. But expensive WATCHES, sleeves
twith high-ranking STRIPES, indicate wealth, power, and a
tmilitary presence.

</b>ttttMARCUS (cont. Filter)
tttFor God's sake, don't come in!

</b>tThe CAMERA is SWATTED by A HAND that lurches suddenly into
tthe foreground. We only see it for a few video frames, but
twe might subliminally notice LESIONS on the flesh. The IMAGE
tSWIRLS wildly. The next clear picture we see... is of the
tsame laboratory...topsy-turvy. THE CAMERA is lying on its
tside on the floor.
<b>t

tttLook.  Here.

</b>tA LASER POINTER casts a RED DOT on a corner of the video
tscreen, indicating A HUNCHED FIGURE, leaning over A HUMAN
tBODY, apparently ...feeding! With a GRUNT, the figure turns.

<b>t
</b><b>tEXT  FOREST LAND   PRE-DAWN
</b><b>t
</b>tA DARK SKY ...and in the foreground, profiled against a FULL
tMOON, A DARK FACE ...watching the heavens with piercing black
teyes, alert, though not predatory. This is CHRIS REDFIELD,
tyoung, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems
tperfectly in place, almost part of the environment.
<b>t
</b>tA band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of
tmagnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting
ton a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ...
<b>t
</b>t...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through
tthe hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes
trecognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad.
<b>t
</b>tThe regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly...
ta freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above
tthe highest water.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttTake it, Goliath. It's yours.
<b>t
</b>t"Goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.
<b>t
</b>ttttCHRIS (cont.)
tttSee ya next year, guy.
<b>t
</b>tChris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another
ttrout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious
tCliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock.
tANOTHER EAGLE, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.
<b>t
</b>ttttCHRIS (cont.)
tttCleopatra.
<b>t
</b>tChris scrambles back to his place and jots another note.
<b>t
</b>t"Cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down.
tShe's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she
trecoils and climbs again, hovering.
<b>t
</b>ttttCHRIS (cont.)
tttCome on. Come on down.
<b>t
</b>tThe eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. It makes another
tdive, but stops short again.
<b>t
</b>ttttCHRIS (cont.)
tttWhat's the matter, beautiful?
<b>t
</b>tThe bird seems frightened.  Of what? It makes one more dive.
tGets very close to the fish... but suddenly SHRIEKS and peels,
taway from the rock. Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as
tit soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tPg-3
<b>t
</b>tCLOSE ON: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear
tover the hills.
<b>t
</b>tOver his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the
tfish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight
tcatches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a
tsharp INHUMAN SOUND.
<b>t
</b>tChris whirls around. There's nothing on the rock. Nothing
tat all. The fish has been taken.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   DAWN
</b><b>t
</b>tCHRIS walks into a characterless apartment. He quietly
tsheds his clothes. Even in silhouette, we can see that his
tbody is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight.
tMoving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases
thimself into a bed where...
<b>t
</b>t...a beautiful young girl, JILL VALENTINE, seems to be fast
tasleep. As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her
teyes, facing away, are open. Chris gently drapes an arm
taround her and lets his body relax.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttt(A whisper) Glad you're still 
ttthere, lady
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttIt's my apartment.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttt(Surprised) You're awake.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttI've been awake. Since you left.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttSorry.
<b>t
</b>tHis apology goes no further. He's still troubled by what
thappened in the hills.
<b>t
</b>ttttCHRIS (cont.)
tttThere was... something wrong.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttWhat, with my dinner? I never had
ttta mother. I'll learn.
<b>t
</b>tChris smiles politely. He offers...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttI'll do the cooking.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tPg-4
<b>t
</b>t...but he can't switch focus.
<b>t
</b>ttttCHRIS (cont.)
tttOn the mountain...there...must
ttthave been something... prowling
tttaround up there.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttThere are probably all kinds of
tttthings prowling around up there.
tttIn the middle of the night.
<b>t
</b>tChris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttI'm sorry. Really. You...have to
tttbe there at dawn. They ride the
tttwind over the ridge.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttDawn? You left at one A.M.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttI had to go fishing. It's the fish
tttthat bring them down, so I can get
ttta close look at them. (Enthused)
tttI've tracked a dozen of them, Jill.
tttTwelve of those big bruisers. I can
tttactually recognize them. I've even
tttgiven them names, over the years.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttYou've been doing this for years?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttOnly in the early Autumn. When
tttthey're' migrating.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttI'II set the alarm for next. October.
<b>t
</b>tJill rolls over and faces him.
<b>t
</b>ttttJILL (cont.)
tttI wish I could get excited. Really.
tttThat's the truth. As excited as you,
tttover such... simple things.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttBeauty... isn't simple. If it was...
tttI'd be beautiful.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttYou are.
<b>t
</b>tPg-5
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttNo, no, no.  I'm simple.  You, on the
tttother hand...(nuzzling closer)...have
tttall that... stuff... hiding underneath
tttsomewhere. That's what fascinates me.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttFascination. Not love?
<b>t
</b>tJill is being playful. Chris, taking her question to heart,
tbecomes introspective.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttI... honestly don't know. I guess
tttI've been... living alone too long.
tttYou're the first, the only woman I've
tttever thought of as... a real partner.
<b>t
</b>tNow Jill becomes introspective.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttI've always been...afraid of living
tttalone. I've always had... people...
ttttalking at me... knowing they could
tttwind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ...
tttwhatever they wanted.
<b>t
</b>tChris looks into her eyes. She kisses him gently.
<b>t
</b>ttttJILL (cont.)
tttWe all have... something hidden...
tttunderneath.  Beauty may not be simple.
tttBut it's not all that complicated,
tttEither.  Most of the time, you find
tttIt... right in the middle of all the...
tttconfusion.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttI'm part Mohawk. Indians are never
tttconfused. At least, they never let
tttit show.
<b>t
</b>tThey kiss again, this time more passionately. Rolling over,
tthey begin to make love.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT   FARM   DAWN
</b>tThe purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite
tdark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the creaking
tdoor of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES
tout into the morning breeze.
<b>t
</b>tTwo dogs, A LAB and A SPANIEL, romp at his heels as Rake
topens a log gate.
<b>t
</b>tPg-6
<b>t-
</b>tTwo of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large
tcorral. The third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting,
ttossing its head in high spirit.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRAKE
</b>tttGet in there, Lucky. Quit horsin'
tttaround. Get in.
<b>t
</b>t"LUCKY" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.
<b>t
</b>ttttRAKE (cont.)
tttSwear. If I didn't know you was
tttjust an animal, I'd say you was all
tttfull of yourself. GET IN THERE!
<b>t
</b>tRake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a
tgreat deal of affection here. Rake shuts the gate behind
tthe stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside
tthe fence. All seems lovely, until...
<b>t
</b>t...the dogs suddenly go on point. Their ears perk. They
tsniff the air...and begin to WHINE.
<b>t
</b>ttttRAKE (cont.)
tttWhat's wrong with you two?
<b>t
</b>tKER-RAAKK! A startling SOUND. Rake turns to find Lucky and
tthe other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to KICK their
tway out of the fencing. They seem terrified.
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO :
</b><b>t
</b>tA WIDE SHOT:  of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS, from
ttwo hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at
tfirst, then gaining speed... extraordinary SPEED. We are
tseeing THROUGH THE EYES OF... whatever it is that's running,
tcharging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY...
<b>t
</b>t...reaching the corral, DARTING through the fence, past the
tKICKING HORSES, and LEAPING at Rake, who whirls around...and
tCRIES OUT in pain as his flashlight BLINDS us with WHITENESS.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
</b><b>t
</b>tThe WHITENESS becomes the GLARE of HALOGEN LIGHTS. We are
toverwhelmed by the SOUND of AIRCRAFT ENGINES. We see MEN,
tarmed SOLDIERS, scrambling into combat HELICOPTERS.
<b>t
</b>tA RADIO MAN runs right toward THE CAMERA, holding out an
topen receiver.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRADIO MAN
</b>tttTop brass, sir!
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tPg-7
<b>t
</b>tANOTHER MAN, in the foreground, takes the radio-phone. We
tcan't see his face. Only his forearm, which bears A TATTOO
tof a grinning SKULL.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAN WITH TATTOO
</b>tttAlpha Leader.
<b>t
</b>ttttVOICE ON PHONE (o.s. filter)
tttHow long before you get in there?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAN WITH TATTOO
</b>tttFifteen minutes.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT   AN OFFICE   DAWN
</b><b>t
</b>tA SUIT talks on a red telephone. Once again, we see no face.
tAn ostentatious diamond RING kicks light as the man snips off
tthe end off a Monte Cristo.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAN WITH RING
</b>tttYou're good, soldier. But not that
tttgood. It's five hundred miles away.
tttIn the backwoods of Pennsylvania.
<b>t
</b>ttttMAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)
tttWe have troopers on site. A first-
tttstrike force. Under cover.
<b>t
</b>tThe flame from a wooden match lights the Monte Cristo.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAN WITH RING
</b>tttVery resourceful.  You have my
tttpermission activate them.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttMAN WITH TATTOO
</b>tttI've already done that. You have my
tttpermission... to say that you gave me
tttpermission.
<b>t
</b>tTHE TATTOOED MAN runs off to join the other SOLDIERS.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tCHRIS sleeps. JILL is awake, deep in thought, when...
<b>t
</b>t...BRRRRT! It's not a ring, it's a vibration. Jill reaches
tdown and extracts something small and black, the size of a
tbox of Tic-Tacs, from one of her shoes. She gets out of bed,
tchecking to see that Chris is still asleep, and moves into...
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tPg-8
<b>t
</b><b>tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   BATHROOM   MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>t...a bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she puts the
tsmall box to her ear, extracts a wire from it, with a tiny
tmicrophone on its tip, and...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>ttt(Softly) Valentine.
<b>t
</b>tWe can't hear the voice that speaks to her.
<b>t
</b>ttttJILL (cont.)
tttIf this is just another a drill,
tttI'll strangle you. (She listens)
tttShit. Give me the activation code.
<b>t
</b>tJILL pulls a small ENVELOPE from a toiletry bag. She breaks
topen a wax seal...and takes out a thick paper on which is
tprinted... 29-RC-6735.
<b>t
</b>ttttJILL (cont.)
ttt(Gaping, not believing) Th-that's
ttta match. (Beat) I'm on my way.
<b>t
</b>tJill clicks off. She dumps something else from the envelope
tinto her hand... A BLUE PLASTIC CARD, the size of a Visa,
tblank except for a mag-stripe. There's a small hole in one
tcorner, through which a chain is strung. Jill slings the
tchain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tCHRIS is still asleep. JILL comes out of the bathroom and
tlooks down at him longingly.  Should she wake him?  Tell him
twhat's happening?  She wants to, but duty prevents it.  She
tpulls herself away.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   CLOSET   MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tTCHIK TCHIK TCHIK...JILL pushes aside hangers which hold her
tclothes. She types numbers into a hidden KEYPAD. A SECRET
tPANEL OPENS, revealing a CLOSET WITHIN THE CLOSET, packed
twith COMBAT UNIFORMS and WEAPONS.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tThe sound... TCHUNG... of the front door closing snaps CHRIS
tawake.  His first thought is for his lover.  He reaches out
tand finds that... she's not in bed.  He jumps up, rushes to
ta window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tPg-9
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>t...JILL, heavily ARMED, in UNIFORM, wearing a beret that has
tan insignia... S.T.A.R.S. She rushes down the front path and
tjumps into A HUMMER with THREE OTHER TROOPERS on board. The
tvehicle pulls instantly away...
<b>t
</b>t...leaving Chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry,
tand very much wounded.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT/EXT   HUMMER   MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tRUSSO drives. WILLIAMS and DISIMONE sit in the back, all
ttough Special-Forces types. JILL, in the front passenger
tseat, though the only female, ranks the highest.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDISIMONE
</b>tttAnother practice run, right?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRUSSO
</b>tttWe been practicin' six months!
tttFor what?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttFor this. This is the real deal.
<b>t

</b>tttHonest to God?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttBased on my experience, Williams,
tttGod isn't always honest
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDISIMONE
</b>tttWhere we goin'?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>tttIn there.
<b>t
</b>tJill points into THE ARKLEY FOREST which lies ahead. Miles
tof old growth-trees shrouded in a ghostly morning mist.
<b>t
</b><b>tDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT   THE FOREST   MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tDEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MIST... THE HUMMER bounces over
tnon-roads and stops fifty yards from...
<b>t
</b>t...A PAIR OF IRON GATES, each wrought with the letter "A".
tBeyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of...
tA MANSION.  Huge.  Like Xandau.  THE TROOPERS, amazed,
tclimb out and approach the gates.
<b>t
</b>tPg-10
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRUSSO
</b>tttIf you had the jing to build a place
tttlike this, would you build it in the

tttOur orders are to secure the area.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDISIMONE
</b>tttFrom what? This area's been 'secure'
tttsince the French and Indian War!
<b>t
</b>tA deep, animal SNARL comes from the woods.  The troopers
traise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush.  The
tfog keeps sunlight from penetrating.  The forest is a maze
tof dark shadows. Leaves flutter.  Limbs SNAP.  Then...
<b>t
</b>tDARK SHAPES can be seen moving, circling.  A half-dozen
tof them.  Maybe more.  Jill whips out a transmitter and
tquickly types an access code.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJILL
</b>ttt(Into radio) This is Valentine,
tttBravo Team. We, er... we might be
tttin trouble, here.
<b>t
</b>tKRITCH! Something LEAPS out of the brush. Automatic
tWEAPONS SPIT reflexively.
<b>t
</b>tKRITCH KRITCH KRITCH...more lunging SHAES appear. The
ttroopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all
tsides. Jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her
ttransmitter.

</b>ttttJILL (cont.)
<b>tttWE ARE IN TROUBLE!

</b>ttttJILL (o.s. filter)
tttUnder attack... by.. .assailants...
tttUnidentifi...
<b>t
</b>tPg-11
<b>t
</b>tStatic. Hissing air. The SHOT WIDENS as the man lowers his
theadset. First we see the TATTOO on his arm... a grinning
tSKULL which we recognize. Then, gradually, we see his face.
tLean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is ALBERT
tWESKER, a hard-assed career officer.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttWESKER
</b>tttCan you get a trace?
<b>t
</b>tThe pilot, LAGUARDIA, responds.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLAGUARDIA
</b>tttLost the beacon. It just cut out.
tttLike it was...swallowed by something.
<b>t
</b>tOddly, Wesker smiles.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttWESKER
</b>tttI do believe, gentlemen...that we're
tttgonna be earning some combat pay.
<b>t
</b>tThere are three other MEN on board. The closest to Wesker
tis BARRY BURTON, a muscular black man, as big as a grizzly,
twith the heart of a Teddy.

</b>tttDamn, if you don't love a fight.
<b>t

<b>t
</b>tWesker and the men fly from the lens.  THE CAMERA passes
tOut through one of the helicopter's windows as the chopper soars
taway.  When the SHOT WIDENS, we see OTHER HUEYS...black,
tunmarked, keeping formation.  Three... six...ten of them.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT   FOREST   MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tGUNS BLAZE. THE TROOPERS are under assault by thrashing,
tinhuman SHAPES...GROWLING, SNAPPING. JILL rolls into a
tnatural trench.  DISIMONE is behind her, WILLIAMS is
tcrawling just ahead, his legs pumping.  Jill scoots past
thim and sees that...
<b>t
</b>t...those legs aren't moving on their own.  They've been
tRIPPED AWAY FROM WILLIAMS' TORSO and are being dragged into
tthe underbrush by some... BEAST... concealed in the thick
tbrush, so we never get a clear look at it.
<b>t
</b>tOTHER BEASTS attack DiSimone.  Then Russo.  We see only
tdetails.  Jill fires her pistol, point blank... to no avail.
tRED-RIMMED EYES, SNARLING JAWS, DROOLING TEETH descend on

</b>tttLet's go, hayseed. (Aiming his M-16)
tttYou gonna be a good boy?

</b>tChris swallows his fury. Gritting his teeth, he goes along
twith the soldiers, prodded, by rifle barrels, out onto...

tonto his belt.

tinto the lab. The thing with. the destroyed face turns toward

tinto the thing's brain. It drops like a sack. The lab

tof his Winchester directly against the aquarium glass...

tthe screws that hold down one of the panels. Other troopers
tdo the same.

</b>tHuman hands work furiously, loosening screws. Panels come

twith her own issued knife. She gets a panel open. As she
tdrops through, a third zombie triggers a burst of steam.
tChris ducks and covers.
<b>t
</b>tWhen the jets stop, Chris begins to climb into the opening,
tbut one of his legs is GRABBED from behind by...

this leg. The thing's lips have been eaten away, making its
tteeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a
tbite of flesh. Chris jams the stock of his Winchester into
tthe zombie's mouth. He's able to hold the thing's head back,
tbut he's stuck. He can't let go.

tThe zombie is PROPELLED through the air. One of its flailing
tarms triggers another laser beam. Chris throws himself in on
ttop of Jill as STEAM HISSES over them.
<b>t
</b>tTwenty yards away, Wesker crawls under the cloud of acid.
tJust as he climbs down through one of the openings, he feels
tpressure...on his ear.
<b>t
</b>tA groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the
twire that runs from the detonator to Wesker's ear-piece.
tFor a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be
tpopped loose. Holding the pulse-reader in place, Wesker
ttwists his body, lifts his hand gun, and PUMPS THREE into
tthe dead thing's brain.
<b>t
</b>tThe zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in
tthe wire. Wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles
tof the thing's dead hand. THREE MORE SHOTS cut through bone,
tremoving the fingers from the hand. The wire is freed.

</b>tPg-91
<b>t
</b>tRosie DIVES off the prongs...directly at the Tyrant. With
tanother lightning move, the monster catches her in its bionic
tclaw, crushing her ribs. With BLOOD spurting from her mouth,
tshe utters her last words...

<b>t
</b>tThey are in the MANSION, which Chris knows well. He leads
this small troop into...
<b>t
</b><b>tINT   POWDER ROOM   TIMELESS
</b><b>t
</b>t...a small powder room, decorated garishly in an East Indian
tmotif. A ceramic TIGER'S HEAD sits atop a vanity. CHRIS
tgrabs it...and TWISTS it on a pivot. A PANEL spins. The
tCOMMODE disappears into the wall, opening a SECRET PASSAGE.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttREBECCA
</b>tttHell of a shit-house.

</b>tttI hope they haven't disabled this.
<b>t
</b>tCHRIS opens the door that covers the clock face. He quickly
tspins the hands until they hit... HIGH NOON.
<b>t
</b>tGRONNNK! A WALL begins to GRIND open, straining against
trust, dirt, from years of idleness. Cobwebs are pulled
tapart and...DAYLIGHT APPEARS!
<b>t
</b>ttttCHRIS (cont.)
tttAlright. We made it.
<b>t
</b>tChris urges the OTHERS out through the opening. At the same
ttime he checks the detonator. The LED is down to SIX MINUTES

tspotted the incoming chopper, are waving at it. There's a
tsense of relief, of salvation. Only Chris notices...

</b>t...a bit of PLASTER falling away from one of the mansion's
tstone walls.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHRIS
</b>tttWatch it. WATCH IIIIT!
<b>t

tbarely escaping the WHISHING SWIPE of its iron claw.

taluminum LADDER unfurls.
<b>t

</b><b>tttGET UP!
</b><b>t
</b>tCHRIS pushes JILL toward the ladder. She pulls on Ada's arm
tand sends her up first. ADA begins to climb. Then REBECCA.
<b>t
</b>tThe Tyrant closes in, SWIPING at Chris, who just manages to
tavoid the SLICE of its mighty claw.
<b>t
</b>tThe RADIO MAN leans out of the door above, holding something.

</b>tttToss it to me!
<b>t
</b>tThe radio man drops the Stinger...a rocket with a shoulder-
tlauncher.. .down into Jill's hands.
<b>t
</b>tChris hits the dirt. The Tyrant tries to crush him by
tstepping on him. Chris rolls away.
<b>t
</b>tThe ladder is too wobbly. Jill can't be sure of launching
tan accurate shot.
<b>t
</b>ttttJILL (cont.)
<b>tttCHRIS!
</b><b>t
</b>tChris looks up. Sees Jill holding the rocket launcher. He
tRUNS past the Tyrant, okey-doking, left, right, then dodging
tleft again. The monster SWIPES at him with its elongated
tclaw. Chris' flack-jacket is caught. Protective fibers fly.
tBut Chris escapes without injury.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tPg-94
<b>t
</b>tJill pitches the weapon. Chris catches it. The Tyrant is
ton him, about to STOMP him with a bionic FOOT when...
<b>t
</b>t...Chris aims at the monster's rhinoceros heart and FIRES!
<b>t
</b>tThe rocket CONNECTS, on target. The casing around the animal
theart EXPLODES... and the Tyrant drops like a giant Redwood...
<b>t
</b>t...on top of Chris's legs.
<b>t
</b>tAs Chris tries to free himself, he checks the detonator.
<b>tTHREE MINUTES. TWO-FIFTY-NINE. EIGHT. SEVEN. SIX.
</b><b>t
</b>tLaGuardia drops his chopper a bit lower. The bottom of the
tladder hits the ground, coming within Chris' reach. He grabs
ton. The helicopter rises again. Chris is pulled out from
tunder the Tyrant's steel body and is LIFTED into the air.
tHe climbs frantically.
<b>t
</b>tAbove him, Jill is still on the ladder as well. Ada and
tRebecca pull her up. Chris DANGLES as the Huey banks away
tover the forest. The tops of TREES whip his legs, but he
thangs on, climbing up... up... until the others catch his
thands and hoist him into the chopper. Chris checks the LED.

<b>t
</b>tLaGuardia pushes his stick. The Huey LUNGES forward at

tinertia. Chris holds himself erect. Through the window,
tin the receding sky, he spots...
