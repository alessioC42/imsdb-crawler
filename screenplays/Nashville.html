tNashville Airport.

<b>2tEXT. NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
tTRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S 
told Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward 
tcoffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the 
tsame direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.

<b>3tINT. AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
tNORMAN is attracted to large x93CONNIE WHITEx94 display.

<b>4tINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
tAt the entrance is another &quot;CONNIE WHITE&quot; display and from the 
tjukebox we hear one of her songs.

tThe waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an 
toverflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.

tThere are several people at the counter with him, including 
tGREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT 
tREESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.

tA small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full 
tor dishes. This is WADE.

<b>tttttWADE
</b>tttt(to SUELEEN)
tttYou want a ride into town?

<b>tttttSUELEEN
</b>tttYou bet.

tREESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the 
tTRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and 
tcheckbook are still there, then he buries himself in his 
tnewspaper.

<b>tttttSUELEEN
</b>tttGot me an audition tonight.

<b>tttttWADE
</b>tttWell, you just remember, if you 
tttcan't kick front, kick back, 'cause 
tttat least you're kicking... Ten 
tttminutes, okay?

tShe nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking 
tlooks at her.

<b>tttttSUELEEN
</b>tttI've just been waiting for the 
tttright spot to sing in... I'm so 
tttnervous...

tShe laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.

<b>tttttSUELEEN
</b>tttI'm good, though. There ain't but 
tttone Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to 
tttbe conceited, but really it's true. 
tttI've been taking special coaching 
tttlessons from Zeke Willard -- he's 
tttjust wonderful. Teaches you how to 
tttphrase; that's really important. 
tttAnd breathing. Well, you know all 
tttabout that. Anyway, I wrote this 
tttsong.

tShe looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do 
tall of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some 
tglasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every 
ttime someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through 
tthe song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks 
taway from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished 
this meal.

<b>tttttSUELEEN
</b>tttOh, listen, I really do go on. 
tttHere's your check. Sure has been 
tttnice talking to you.

tAs she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the 
tjukebox, &quot;Keep on a goin'.&quot;  The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>5tINT. CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAY
</b>
tWe hear the last chorus or &quot;Keep on a goin'&quot; as sung by HAVEN, 
twho is recording.

tHe is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY 
tPEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is 
taccompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater. 
tHAVEN is not too happy with him. 

<b>6tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tOPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape 
trecorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and 
tthe piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming 
tinstructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.

<b>7tINT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tOPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.

<b>tttttBUD
</b>tttSorry. He sees a tape recorder and 
tttgets upset.

tShe looks at him.

<b>tttttBUD
</b>tttHe's my father.

<b>tttttOPAL
</b>tttHaven Hamilton is your father? Can 
tttyou arrange an interview?

<b>8tINT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY
</b>
tThey have entered a different control tooth. In the recording 
tportion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song. 
tOPAL asks BUD who this group is.

<b>9tINT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAY
</b>
tBUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and 
tstarts to leave, yelling at the producer.

<b>tttttHAVEN
</b>tttWho the hell is playing piano? Get 
tttthat hippie out of here... He's got 
ttta tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. 
tttI'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to 
tttthe airport. When you get my 
tttbackups straight, then we'll talk 
tttabout cutting this tune here.

tHe heads for the hallway.

<b>10tINT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tIt is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates 
tbeing crushed and moves through the congestion like a white 
tknight. OPAL moves near.

<b>tttttOPAL
</b>tttExcuse me, sir. I'm here putting 
ttttogether a film. I would like to 
tttask some questions.

tShe has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.

<b>tttttHAVEN
</b>tttForeigner?

<b>tttttOPAL
</b>tttI'm from BBC television.

<b>tttttHAVEN
</b>tttWhere the hell is that?

tHAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and 
tPEARL. He spots LINNEA.

<b>tttttHAVEN
</b>tttLinnea.

<b>tttttLINNEA
</b>tttHow you doing, Haven?

<b>tttttHAVEN
</b>tttoh, fine. Couldn't be better.

<b>15tEXT. LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
tGLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a 
tgathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. 
tEverybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps 
tclose to NORMAN.

<b>tttttGLENN
</b>tttAm I late?

<b>tttttNORMAN
</b>tttLate!  Oh, Jesus!

tHe runs off.

<b>16tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tAs NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep 
tarrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. 
tREESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT 
tis already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all 
tshake hands.

<b>tttttHAVEN
</b>tttDelbert, how are you?

<b>tttttREESE
</b>tttI'm fine. This here is John 
tttTriplette. Triplette, like you to 
tttmeet the Honorary Mayor, Haven

tttpictures and signing autographs. 
tttShe's got a new album cut again. 
tttShe'll be down in a minute. But 
tttshe'll be late for the Opera if she 
tttdoesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on 
tttthe walkie-talkie.

tBUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get 
tanything.

<b>tttttBUD
</b>tttThey don't seem to be answering. 
tttThe ambulance boys are here, though. 
tttBarnett always expects them to get 
tttthere like a shot. That thing only 
tttgoes a hundred fall bore with the 
tttsirens going.

<b>tttttHAVEN
</b>tttThank you, Bud.

tBUD nods like he has been complimented.

<b>17tANGLE TOWARD PLANE
</b>
tA wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes 
tand horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes 
tas BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, 
tespecially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of 
tapplause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been 
texposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in 
tawe of the situation.

tWhen the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN 
tdescends the stairs.

<b>tttttHAVEN
</b>tttBud, tell them to move the horses. 
tttPromised this strip would be spic 
tttand span.

tHe smiles and winks.

<b>tttttREESE
</b>tttListen, we'll go get the car and 
tttcome back. This'l1 be going on for 
ttta while.

<b>tttttHAVEN
</b>tttYou bet. She's probably talking to 
tttsomebody about their sick child. You 
tttknow how she is.

tThey wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone. 
tBehind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars 
tand horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.

tBARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL 
twhile BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.

<b>19tEXT. AIRPORT NEAR PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
tWhile the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN 
tfinds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath, 
ttrying to pretend he's on time.

<b>tttttNORMAN
</b>tttHi.

tBILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.

<b>tttttBILL
</b>tttHi, Norman.

tNORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.

<b>tttttNORMAN
</b>tttSure is nice to see you all again. 
tttI never thought I'd see you again 
tttafter the last time.

<b>tttttBILL
</b>tttOh, Norman, you worry too much.

tMARY takes NORMAN'S hand.

<b>tttttMARY
</b>tttNorman, how are you?

tShe kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to 
tsomeone else.

<b>tttttNORMAN
</b>tttFine. Just fine.

tAs they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top 
tof it and clearly written door signs that read: &quot;Replacement 
tParty&quot; in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking 
ttoward it, shaking hands with several people.

<b>tttttNORMAN
</b>tttSure have missed you all, though. 
tttOh, where's Tom?  Isn't he with you?

tTOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof.

tNearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the 
tReplacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape-
trecorded VOICE:

<b>tttttVOICE
</b>tttHave you thought about your future 
tttand what America needs to examine...

tBehind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with &quot;Connie 
tWhite&quot; posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He 
tcranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.

<b>21tEXT. PARKING LOT
</b>
tNORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the 
tTRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also 
tjoins the procession.

<b>22tANGLE TOWARD RUNWAY
</b>
tThe orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and 
tthere seems to be a great deal at activity.

tREESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into 
tHAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.

<b>23tNEW ANGLE
</b>
tTwo ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE 
tand REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN, 
twho has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia. 
tThey test her reflexes, etc..

<b>tttttATTENDANT
</b>tttHow long was she out?

<b>tttttBARNETT
</b>tttNot too long. But she keeps 
tttpassing out.

tShe comes to and looks at them all.

</b>tttt (oblivious)
tttJust give your manna that vitamin 
tttE. Makes a world of difference.

<b>tttttHAVEN
</b>tttHere she is again.

tShe resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.

<b>tttttATTENDANT
</b>tttOkay, let's get her to the wagon.

tA stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT 
tclimbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on 
tDELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people. 
tDELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance 
tspeeds off, siren wailing.

</b>tttt (hasn't heard) 
tttIt's hard to say. Doctors thought

tttJust like L.A.

tShe laughs.

<b>tttttSUELEEN
</b>tttNo -- That's exercises. My coach 
tttsays you have to do exercise because

<b>tttttBARNETT
</b>tttI said 'no!'

tBARNETT studies the angry crowd then TRIPLETTE, who is holding 
tback GLENN against them. The crowd is even more angry

<b>tttttBARNETT
</b>tttt (to crowd)
tttWe're very Sorry... Please... If 
tttyou'll listen.
tttt (he makes the 
tttt decision)
tttYou can see her tomorrow at Percy

tMoves closer.

</b>tttNo, you don't, so don't say you do. 
tttBunch of damn liars. What do you

<b>tttttTRIPLETTE
</b>tttNothing; Barnett. It's my job.

<b>tttttBARNETT
</b>tttYour job, huh.

tHe removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he 
tspeaks.

<b>tttttBARNETT
</b>tttShe will not appear on the stage or 
tttsupport that Walker guy and you 
tttcan't have any of his signs up while 
tttshe sings. She'll be on first and 
tttout of the park before he shows up. 
tttThere will be no pictures, no 
tttquestions, no answers or tying her 
tttname up with his now or in the 
tttfuture to come. Any money she makes 
tttwill go to the President of the 
tttUnited States.

tHe calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the 
tstatement. Then the secretary signs.

</b>tttWe'll see you tomorrow. I'll send 
ttther three songs over this afternoon. 
tttShe'll be done about ten minutes 
tttafter she starts and Walker better

tttget out of here.

tTRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores 
tit. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S 
tattention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary.

<b>tttttMAN
</b>tttBarnett?

<b>tttttBARNETT
</b>tttt (sharply)
tttWhat?

<b>tttttMAN
</b>tttWell, Barnett, I have this terrific

tttbe a natural for Barbara Jean. Like

tBARNETT looks at him suspiciously.

</b>tttI'm very busy right now.
tttt (to secretary) 
tttt Get me Haven.

<b>tttttMAN
</b>tttIt'll just take a minute. Here, 
tttI'll even hold it for you.

tBABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the 
tsame as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged.

<b>tttttBARNETT
</b>tttI don't know where you got this, 
tttbut something tells me you stole it 
tttand I hate thieves.

tThe MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him -- 
tBARNETT yells after him.

<b>tttttBARNETT
</b>tttAren't you an engineer...?  I know 
tttyou -- Don't you work at one of 
tttthose cut a record places...? 
tttTwenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it? 
tttUsually their last twenty-five...

tThe MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the 
tcrowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the 
tMAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and 
thits the windshield with it. The car MISFIRES but finally 
tstarts.. As the MAN drives off, BARNETT stands watching until 
the's out of sight.

tfrom another part or the field;

tAround the stage -we SEE a sign that says, &quot;Talent Show Tonight&quot; 
tand we see the contestants and the MC, and NORMAN doing a routine 
twith an accordion player. After NORMAN finishes, the NC takes 
tthe mike.

tShe starts to sing, &quot;You're an Old Smoothie,&quot; and as she does the 
tstock cars leave the pit and drive to the entrance of the track. 
tALEBUQUERQUE, disturbed at first, sings louder. The cars are 
twaiting for the talent show to set off the track.

<b>188tNEW ANGLE
</b>
tAlbuquerque starts to take off her clothes. The MC hasn't 
tnoticed, but the grandstand has. People shout, &quot;Take it off...&quot;  
tALBUQUERQUE loves it. Before ALBUQUERQUE can remove the last two 
tgarments, the MC rushes over and grabs the mike.

tA wave of applause and we SEE the talent show make its way across 
tthe rack. The platform is already torn down and the MC is 
thelping ALBUQUERQUE dress. As she passes the drivers, they cheer 
tand she blows them a kiss and loses her first garment as she 
tdoes. More cheers.

tShare. Their four kids will sure miss their daddy. Want to 
tannounce Bob Trilltree is out of the hospital now. Hope you'll

tThe people stand to a scratchy record of the National Anthem. A 
t'74 Pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium-sized 
tAmerican flag which flaps as the convertible drive.. At the end 
tof the song the Pontiac drives off the track.

<b>tAL
</b>tThis is for Billy Apple. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's pick 
tourselves a winner.

tThe drivers get into their cars and start up. The track man 
twaves a flag which starts them around the track in pairs. We 
tnotice the TRICYCLE MAN, who has been there all the time. The 
trace starts and the SOUND is deafening. ALBUQUERQUE is thrilled 
tto death. Suddenly, STAR sneaks up on her as she whistles with 
ther fingers in her mouth.
