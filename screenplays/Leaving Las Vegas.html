</b><b>tTITLE ON BLACK; '10 P.M. - LOS ANGELES'
</b><b>t
</b><b>tDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t1 INT. SMART BAR IN BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b><b>tt
</b>tIt is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of LA go 
tto pick up - or be picked up. Lesser-known actors, agents 
tand executives of all ages.
<b>t
</b>tInto this bar comes Ben.
<b>t
</b>tBen is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit 
tthat could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't 
tshaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has 
tany of the actors in the bar). He is a good-looking man 
tbut is clearly in trouble of some kind. Although still 
tin control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the 
tfollowing scene that he is much the worse for wear with 
tdrink. He looks around the room until he sees someone he
trecognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples
tare seated. The men are young execs, the girls, both blonde 
tand busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. 
tThe camera follows Ben over to the table. One of the execs
tlooks up as Ben gets close. He recognizes him but delays 
this recognition until the last moment in the hope that Ben 
tis not looking at him.
<b>t 
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttPeter
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPETER
</b>ttBen... how are you, man?
<b>t
</b>tThey shake hands. Ben is not invited to take a seat and 
tPeter waits for a while before being forced to introduce him 
tto the table.
<b>t
</b>tBen Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum, Sheila, Debbie.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttMARC
</b>ttNice to meet you. I think I t
ttspoke to you on the phone a t
ttcouple of years ago. Weren't t
ttyou both at MGM with Laddie?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThat's right. Are you still
ttat ICM?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARC
</b>ttNo, I'm at Tri-Star now.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThat's great. Say hello to t
ttMike for me. That's a t
ttbeautiful dress, Debbie, and t
ttthose are fabulous earrings, t
ttSheila.
<b>t
</b>tThere is an awkward silence. Ben does not make a move and 
tis not invited to join them. The girls smile.
<b>t 
</b><b>ttttMARC
</b>ttI gotta tell you, I'm a big t
ttfan of your writing. I loved t
ttBay of Pigs.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThanks a lot. I didn't t
ttactually write it, I just got 
ttthe credit. I was fired.
ttt(to Peter)
ttCan I talk to you for a t
ttmoment?
<b>t
</b>tPeter gets up and he and Ben walk to the door together. 
tPeter speaks very quietly.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPETER
</b>ttListen, Ben, I can't help you 
ttany more. Do you understand?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>tttThis is the last time. t
ttPromise. I just need some t
ttcash tonight. I lost my t
ttcredit cards. The money'll be 
tton your desk first thing t
tttomorrow morning, Scout's t
tthonor. How's the new one t
ttcoming along? I here you got t
ttRichard Gere.
<b>t
</b>tThe two men look at each other for a while. Peter's 
tfriends are looking at them, as are other people in 
tthe room. Peter takes out his wallet and extracts some 
tnotes.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPETER
</b>ttThis is all I have in cash. t
ttPlease don't drink it here.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes, that's fine. I'llt
ttmessenger it over to you t
tttomorrow.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPETER
</b>ttI don't want it. Ben... I
ttthink it would be best if you 
ttdidn't contact me again.
<b>t
</b>tAnd he turns and walks away, back to his table.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO BLACK:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tTITLE ON BLACK; 'LAS VEGAS - 1.20 A.M.'
</b><b>t
</b><b>tFADE UP ON:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t2 EXT. HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tLas Vegas. A blaze of color in the middle of a desert.
<b>t
</b>tCredit sequence begins.
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t3 INT. LOBBY OF EXPENSIVE HOTEL - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tA mixture of businessmen and gamblers creates a sense 
tof activity and superficial excitement. Music wafts 
tacross the soundtrack, almost drowned by the dense 
ttexture of thousands of slot machines, creating an 
tinsane New Age symphony.
<b>t
</b>tCredit sequence ends.
<b>tt
</b>tInto the lobby from the street comes Sera.
<b>t
</b>tIt's hard to tell how old Sera is - somewhere between 
ttwenty-five and thirty-five. She is a beautiful American 
tgirl. Her face has the freshness of a model in a Sears 
tcatalogue. She is dressed simply in a short black skirt 
tand matching jacket. High heels complete the picture. 
tHeads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's 
tclear they find her very sexy. She acknowledges their 
tglance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator. 
tShe could be a secretary, or a PA to one of the many 
texecs here in Las Vegas at a convention. The body language 
tis a bit different, though.
<b>t
</b><b>t4 INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE OF HOTEL - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tA view of night-time Las Vegas through a window. Traffic up 
tand down The Strip; bright, gaudy neon flashing and winking.
tWe hear the sound of men laughing and the camera pulls 
tfocus and we see reflected in the glass...
<b>t
</b>t...a group of people.
<b>t
</b>tOn the table are bowls of potato chips and dip and 
tsandwiches. The TV is on at a sports channel and two 
tboxers pound the shit out of each other.
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t5 INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tSera looks at herself in the gold-tinted mirror in 
tthe elevator. She takes out a lipstick and freshens 
ther lips. Some people get out and the elevator climbs 
thigher. We see from the indicator that she has punched 
tthe Penthouse button. Camera moves in tighter and we 
tsee that she is nervous but concealing it well. The 
televator stops, the doors open and she steps right 
tinto the Penthouse.
<b>t
</b><b>t6 INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tA bottle of Scotch is almost empty. The man talking is Yuri. 
tHe is Russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, 
ta big man wearing a blue silk suit. His thick black hair 
tis greased and combed back. He wears a lot of jewelry, 
tall gold. Rings, a bracelet and a Rolex. Two men in 
tbusiness suits and a weird stoned woman in her late 
tthirties listen to him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>tt...but please, my friends, t
ttcall me Yuri. It is my t
ttAmerican name... I picked it t
ttmyself.
<b>t
</b>tThe three people laugh. There is a hint of contempt in 
tthe way that they speak to Yuri.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttFIRST BUSINESSMAN
</b>ttWhere are you from, Yuri? I t
ttmean, you sure don't talk t
ttlike you're from this neck of 
ttthe woods. 
<b>t
</b>tYuri smiles at them.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttt(silky voice)
ttNo... you are right, my t
ttfriend. How very observant t
ttyou are. I am from Latvia.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttWEIRD WOMAN
</b>ttTough place.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttYes, I hear this too. But I t
ttam not a tough man. I am a t
ttsimple man who is here to t
ttlearn from my new American t
ttfriends.
<b>t
</b>tThe door opens and Sera comes in. Everybody stares at her.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttWEIRD WOMAN
</b>ttt(turned on)
ttIs this your friend, Yuri?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttAh, yes... Sera.
<b>t
</b>tThe second businessman takes out a small manila envelope from 
this inside pocket.
<b>t
</b>ttttYURI(cont'd)
ttSera is my gift to you, my t
ttfriends from New York City. t
ttYou may do with her as you t
ttwish in this beautiful room, t
ttwhich is also my gift for the 
ttnight to my friends. You will 
ttfind her a very willing girl, 
ttfor all of you...just as we t
ttarranged.
<b>t
</b>tYuri smiles again as the Second Businessman hands him the 
tenvelope. The rest of them just stare at Sera, aroused by the 
tidea of her.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttSECOND BUSINESSMAN
</b>ttOf course, Yuri. I think t
ttyou'll find this just as we t
ttdiscussed.
<b>tt
</b>tYuri gets up.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttSo, my friends... I have other 
ttbusiness to attend. Enjoy.
<b>tt
</b><b>tt
</b>tHe heads for the door, passing Sera. She holds out his arm as 
the passes.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttYuri... please! Can I talk to t
ttyou for a moment.
<b>tt
</b><b>tt
</b>tStill smiling, he takes Sera's arm and leads her into the 
tbedroom.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttMy friends... excuse me for t
ttjust one moment. 
<b>tt
</b><b>tt
</b><b>t7 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
</b>
tMirrors reflect mirrors.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI don't want this. Yuri, t
ttplease. I really don't want t
ttthis. You know I don't like t
ttto do groups.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttt(playful)
ttI want this, Sera. I need t
ttthis!   
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttSERA
</b>ttPlease, Yuri.
<b>tt
</b><b>tt
</b><b>tt
</b>tHe holds put his arms. Sera goes to him. He hugs her with one 
tarm. He pulls up her skirt so that her panties are exposed.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttt(seductive)
ttThese are pretty.
<b>t
</b>tSera watches in the mirror as he pulls her panties to reveal 
ther buttocks. He strokes her there gently with his other 
thand. We see that there are two fine scars there. He speaks 
tgently, like a father to a daughter.
<b>t
</b>ttttYURI(cont'd)
ttIs this how you would repay t
ttme for coming all this way to 
ttfind you again? Driving t
ttthrough the desert to protect 
ttmy little Sera.
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tFLASHBACK-SILENT-GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE
</b><b>t
</b><b>t8 INT. ROOM - NIGHT
</b>tYuri and Sera - different time, different place. Sera looking 
tfrightened, backing away from Yuri, who pulls a switchblade 
tfrom his jacket and opens it.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tCUT BACK TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t9 INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>tYuri enters from the bedroom. The weird woman is doing a line 
tof coke.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttt(cheerful)
ttSera wanted me to ask if she t
ttmight undress at once for t
ttyou. She has a very beautiful 
ttundergarment witch she would t
ttlike you to see.
<b>t
</b><b>tANGLE ON BEDROOM DOOR
</b><b>t
</b>tSera comes into the room. She smiles and begins unbuttoning 
ther jacket.
<b>t
</b>tShe takes it off and drops it on the floor, and then unzips 
ther skirt and steps out of it. Sera is now in control and 
tplaying the room. In the background. Yuri leaves the room.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttWEIRD WOMAN
</b>ttt(strange voice)
ttCome here.
<b>t
</b>tSera walks over and something strange takes place between 
tthem.
<b>ttt
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>tt
</b><b>t10 INT. BEN'S BAR. LA - MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tThe bar is dark but through a small window we see that it is 
ta very bright sunny day outside. The bartender reads the Los 
tAngeles Times. The bar surface is red vinyl. There are five 
tcustomers, all single men. One of them is Ben and he is 
tsitting at the bar watching TV. A game show is in progress 
tand the TV sound is loud. Ben finishes his drink and grimaces 
tbefore indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat. 
tBarman pours him a whiskey - Cranberry - and the camera moves 
tin closer to Ben, ending in a close-up. Ben takes a big hit 
tfrom the drink and concentrates on the TV. We hear from the 
tTV sound that it is a word game with a big prize. Ben smiles 
tto himself.
<b>t
</b><b>tBEN'S POV OF TV
</b><b>t
</b>tThe talk show hostess, an American TV beauty, is showing the 
taudience the prizes available in today's game show.
<b>t
</b><b>tANGLE ON BEN
</b><b>t
</b>tAs he finishes that drink and asks for another. The camera 
tmoves in close on his eyes. 
<b>t
</b><b>tBEN'S POV OF TV
</b><b>t
</b>tShe turns from the prizes and looks straight into the TV 
tcamera, which starts zooming into her. At first, what she is 
tsaying makes complete sense, but then things change...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttt(smoky, sexy voice)
ttJust look at this studio, t
ttBen, filled with glamorous t
ttmerchandise, including an t
ttextra special prize chosen t
ttjust for You! A big, bad, BMW 
ttmotorcycle, complete with t
ttsaddle bags stuffed with t
ttthousands of US dollars.
<b>t
</b>t"There are oohs" from the audience.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttSo, Ben,
ttt(tosses her hair)
ttLet's find a bar, get drunk t
ttand go for a ride.
<b>t
</b>tThe studio lights dim.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttThen we can get a suite t
ttsomewhere and order up a case 
ttof champagne while we fuck t
ttourselves silly.
<b>t
</b>tClose-up on males in the audience doing the grunt.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttThis is it, just for You,
ttBen. 
<b>t
</b>tShe unbuttons her top, licks her fingers and makes her 
tnipples hard.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttBecause You've been so 
ttpatient, and because I want 
ttto fuck you, take care of 
ttYou, and because there's 
ttnothing else in the world 
ttworth doing.
<b>t
</b>tSection of the audience clapping - some women dabbing their 
teyes.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttTell you what, Ben, let's go 
ttto Las Vegas. The bars stay 
ttopen twenty four hours night 
ttand day. Just you, just me, 
ttBen, think about it, all 
ttright? 
<b>t
</b><b>tANGLE ON BEN
</b><b>t
</b>tLost in his fantasy
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'll think about it.
<b>t
</b>tHe looks back at the screen, but the show has returned to 
twhat is known as "normal". He finishes his drink and then an 
tattack of nausea hit him. He takes a deep breath and rolls 
this neck and his head. The barman puts down a fresh drink. 
tBen looks at his own hands...which are steady.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBARMAN
</b>ttYou should go on that show.
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t11 INT. SMART BUSINESS SPACE - MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tBen sitting at a desk with a phone wedged on his ear, a cup 
tof black coffee on the desk. The walls are covered with 
ttframed film posters and one complete wall has shelves jammed 
twith scripts. He nods from time to time and sometimes says 
t'yes' or 'OK', but it becomes clear that there is no one on 
tthe other end. He drinks from the coffee cup. A woman comes 
tup to his desk, a business colleague. She puts a wad of 
tmessages down on the desk.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYeah, but what's the back end 
ttlike? By the time we're 
ttthrough with P and A, the 
ttabove-the line is going to 
tttake it to about fifteen and 
ttwith something like this... I 
ttdon't know if Disney will go 
ttfor it... can I call you back 
tton this? OK... chow for now.
ttt(to the woman)
ttGood morning.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(cautious)
ttBen... Mr. Simpson was looking 
ttfor you. I said that you had 
tta doctor's appointment. He 
ttsaid for you to go in as soon 
ttas... are you OK?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(pulling himself together)
ttI'm fantastic, but I gotta go 
ttout now... very important 
ttmeeting, could make a coupla 
ttmillion for the company.
<b>t
</b>tBen gets up and as he passes her he grabs her and dances a 
tfew steps. It is clear that she likes Ben, but when his face 
tgets close to hers she smells the alcohol on his breath and 
tshe turns away. Ben stops dancing and smiles sadly.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(tender)
ttBen?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttYou should go now.
<b>t
</b>tShe leaves the room and Ben goes through some routine at the 
tdesk. He opens a drawer of a filing cabinet and puts in his 
twhole arm, looking for something at the very back. He pulls 
tout a small vodka bottle and opens it and then pours the 
ttcontents into his coffee cup. With cup in hand he leaves the 
troom.
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t12 INT. SMART OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tBen is sitting opposite his boss, Mr. Simpson, who is very 
tupset. He hands Ben an envelope. Ben opens it and pulls out a 
tcheck. He looks at the amount.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(genuinely moved) 
ttThis is to generous Peter.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSIMPSON
</b>ttt(close to tears)
ttWell... we liked having you 
ttaround, Ben, but you know how 
ttit is.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(ashamed)
ttSure thing... and I'm sorry.
<b>t
</b>tBen takes a swig from his coffee cup.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSIMPSON
</b>ttt(trying to cheer things along)
ttWell... what are you going to 
ttdo now?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI thought I might move out to 
ttLas Vegas.
<b>t
</b>tSimpson looks puzzled.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThe bars never close.
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t13 INT. BEN'S BMW x97 DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tBen drives though Beverly Hills. He pours the content of a 
tsmall bottle of vodka into an empty Coke can, puts the empty 
tbottle under the seat and then drinks from the can.
<b>t
</b>tHe slips a tape into the player and we hear "Lonely 
tTeardrops", by Michael McDonald, one of Ben's favorite songs. 
tAt a traffic light a cop on a bike pulls up next to him and 
tBen takes a pull from the Coke can and smiles, mouths the 
tword "hot". The cop nods back at him, the light changes and 
tthey both pull away.
<b>tt
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t14 EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET x97 DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tBen carries a brown paper bag which clinks. Camera follows 
thim as he walks down the street. He looks at... 
<b>t
</b><b>tBEN'S POV
</b><b>t
</b>tA girl walking ahead of him in the same direction. She is 
twalking her dog. She is attractive from behind. We hear Ben's 
tthoughts.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(voice-over)
ttBeautiful, no just the shape 
ttwhich is nice, but the whole 
ttwalk, the feeling, the 
ttmovement. This girl is 
ttpleased with herself. Maybe 
ttthis is the only art I can 
ttappreciate... I don't know if 
ttthis is good or bad, but 
ttright now she is really 
ttbeautiful. When I was a boy 
ttit would have been really 
ttimportant that she have a 
ttpretty face, to go with this 
ttbody, I mean. I still would 
ttlike to see her face, but her 
ttbeauty is no dependent on her 
ttface.
<b>t
</b>tThe dog gets interested in something on the sidewalk and she 
tbends down to pull at its collar. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(voice-over)
ttI wonder what kind of panties 
ttshe's wearing. Shit, that's 
tttoo specific, but... on the 
ttother hand, you can never be 
tttoo specific... but then, the 
ttinfinitesimal must be, by 
ttdefinition, as infinite as 
ttthe infinite.
<b>t
</b>tSuddenly the girl stops. Ben catches up with her and cannot 
tresist looking into her face.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(voice-over)
ttGod, she's so young.
<b>tt
</b>tThe girl sees Ben and smiles an innocent smile,
<b>t
</b><b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttHi!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHi... 
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t15 EXT. BEN'S HOUSE IN SANT MONICA - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tBen walks up to his house still carrying the paper bag. A 
tyoung boy of about thirteen years of age is fixing a beat-up 
tbike. Ben greets him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHey, Brad... how's it going?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBRAD
</b>ttHey Ben. There were a couple 
ttof guys looking for you.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat did they look like?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBRAD
</b>ttSuits. I didn't tell them 
ttanything. You know anything 
ttabout gears?
<b>t
</b>tBen takes a look. The gear mechanism is all bent out of 
tshape. He bends down to have a look. It is clear from the way 
the deals with this mechanical problem that he's good with his 
thands. He doesn't try to force anything but he moves the 
tchain and gear mechanism to get to the problem.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHow'd this happen? 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBRAD
</b>ttI was going real fast down on 
ttthe beach and something 
ttslipped and everything got 
ttjammed up.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThe news is not good, kid. 
ttThis bit here... see 
ttthere... it's broken. You need 
tta new  one.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBRAD
</b>ttt(upset)
tttHow much, do you think?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI don't know. I'll find out 
ttthough.
<b>t
</b>tBen gets up, picks up his bottles and heads for his house. He 
tlooks back and Brad is sitting still by the bike, looking 
ttotally dejected. This really seems to upset Ben.
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t16 INT. BEN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</b><b>t
</b>tBen is naked and the shower can be heard in the background. 
tThe house is austere, only the minimum of furnishing. He 
tpours a large tumbler of vodka and takes a gulp, then tops up 
tthe glass. He turns on the stereo, selects a record - Miles 
tDavis, Kind of Blue - and puts it on the turntable. He turns 
ton the cassette recorder and inserts a new blank tape. He 
tputs the machine into the record mode. He kneels down next to 
tthe deck and with complete precision puts the needle on the 
tsecond track without any problem. The music starts and 
tcontinues through the next sequence. 
<b>t
</b><b>t17 INT. SHOVER - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tBen is in the shower with the glass in his hand.
<b>t
</b><b>t18 INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tBen shaving with the glass in his hand. He does the area 
taround his mouth first so that he can drink while he does the 
trest.
<b>t
</b><b>t19 INT. LIVING SPACE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tShowered and shaved and wearing a smart dark suit, Ben looks 
thandsome and normal. He selects another record and again sets 
tup the cassette machine to record. He turns the stereo up 
tfull and dances by himself while watching MTV silent. He 
ttries a turn which is a bit ambitious and loses hi balance. 
tIn slow motion we see him fall. Ben lies still on the floor. 
tHe smiles to himself and decides top stay there for a 
twhile... 
<b>t
</b><b>tFADE OUT:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tFADE IN:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t20 INT. SERA'S BEDROOM. LAS VEGAS - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tSera wakes up in bed next to Yuri. (The camera is high above 
tthe bed looking down.) She is completely drenched in sweat. A 
tthin shaft o light comes from the crack in the drapes and 
ttfalls across their bodies. Other than that, the room is in 
tdarkness. To get out of bed she would have to climb over him. 
tShe lies still. Yuri speaks without opening his eyes... 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttI missed you, Sera. You have 
ttbeen lonely?
<b>t
</b>tSera blinks and turns her head towards him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI'm older now, Yuri.
<b>t

trepeating the sane phrase over and over again. He looks at 
this gold Rolex and then fingers the wedding band on his 
tfinger.

</b><b>t

</b>tHe drinks this a little slower but still too quick, finishes

ta woman sitting by herself, thirtyish, pretty and receptive.

tnoise with her straw to indicate that her glass is empty.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'll get you another 
ttone... and me too. Mind if I 
ttjoin you?
<b>t
</b>tShe watches him walk to the bar. He gets the drink and walks 
tback to her. He sets the drinks down on the table and sits 
tdown. As he does so, his face gets close to hers and she 
tsmells the booze on him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPRETTY WOMAN
</b>ttWow... been drinking all day?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut of course.
<b>t
</b>tShe looks at him, a disappointed expression on her face. She 
tis no longer interested in being seduced by this man and this

<b>t

</b>ttWhy don't we finish these and 
ttgo to my apartment on the

</b>tHe stops and frowns as he stares into his empty glass.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo, OK.
<b>t
</b>tBen tries to stand and has to pull himself up by holding the 
tbar. It's a strange thing with drunks like Ben... when they're 
tup they have balance and timing, but when they're down it all 
tfalls apart. She starts to speak but then doesn't. A look of 
tgreat sadness comes over her.
<b>t 
</b><b>ttttPRETTY WOMAN
</b>ttI have to go now. Thanks 
ttanyway.
<b>t
</b>tShe stands to go.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPRETTY WOMAN

tBarman, who is a little concerned.

ttMaybe I shouldn't breathe so

ttTime to go, buddy... We're

ttries again, but to no avail.

<b>t
</b><b>tANGLE ON THE STAGE
</b><b>t
</b>tA tough black girl dances in a world of her own, impervious 
tto the men who stare at her. The trio grinds out a dirty 
tblues. A man opposite Ben places a dollar bill on the stage 
tand as the dancer squats down to pick it up he stares between 
ther legs an winks. The Waitress puts down a styrofoam cup and 
ta bottle of water in front of Ben but refuses to look at him.

twhen he slows down she ducks into a doorway.

</b>tHe looks in his rear-view mirror and sees a cop car coming up 
tfast. Ben panics for a second. There is a bottle between his 
tlegs. The cop car draws level and cruises alongside him for a 
twhile, but then puts its lights and siren on and speeds off, 
tdoing a U-turn.
<b>tt

twinds down the window. He is by now almost incoherent.

ta wave of nausea hits him. He shakes his head violently and

tand its light is what lights Ben. Inside the fridge are one

teffort Ben feels for his wallet and sees that it is still 
tthere, as are his car keys. He closes the fridge door and in 
tthe green light from the window he lies still. The first

tsome game show as before, and Ben watches carefully, looking 
tfor a sign from the girl, but the show proceeds in its 
t'normal' fashion. The only difference is that the hostess is 
tplayed by the girl in the bank. Ben grabs the Barman's

tcheerful way that the game-show Hostess dealt with her prize-
twinners. She notices Ben waiting and an irritated look 
tflashes over across her face. Ben studies her. She is pretty

</b>ttSera! It's... 
<b>t
</b>tHe looks around for a clock.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>tt... it's late.
<b>t
</b><b>t76 INT. YURI'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tSera comes into the room, takes her purse out and counts out 
tseven hundred dollars.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttSorry, Yuri... good 
ttnight... lots of tricks... I 
ttthink things are picking up.
<b>tt
</b>tYuri sits on the bed. He looks unwell and disoriented. His 
tface is covered with a thin film of sweat. He seems to be 
tlistening for something, because he stops her talking by 
tputting his fingers to his lips. He looks at her and then 
ttbeckons her to the bed. Sera is nervous. As she walks to the 
tbed, she begins unbuttoning her blouse. Yuri stops her with a 
twave of his hand. Sera is puzzled and frightened now. Yuri 
tseems to be deranged.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttHave you told anyone that I'm 
tthere?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttNo.
<b>t
</b>tYuri suddenly hears something. He grabs Sera's hand and takes 
ther to the wall. He presses her head to the wall.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttDo you here that?
<b>t
</b>tHe looks at her.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttThey're talking about me.
<b>t
</b>tHe pulls himself together.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttGo, Sera.
ttt(whispers)
ttGo. Stay at home. I will call 
ttyou tomorrow.
<b>ttttSERA
</b>ttYuri... are you... 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttt(patiently)
ttSera... please go.
<b>t
</b>tHe indicates the wall.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttThis is very important... and 
ttI must listen. Now go.
<b>t
</b>tThey face each other for a moment and then Yuri does an 
talmost comic gesture to tell her to go. He hustles her to the 
tdoor and shoves her out as she is still buttoning up her 
tblouse. He slams the door. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttYURI
</b>ttt(through the door)
ttGoodbye, Sera. Don't come 
ttback here. I will not see you 
ttagain.
<b>t
</b>tSera stands there for a while, almost in shock, and then she 
ttbegins to walk. The camera follows her as she makes her way 
tdown the endless corridor of doors. Ahead of her, three men 
tare walking towards her, checking the door numbers as they 
tmake their way. Sera doesn't take them in. They pass and turn 
ta corner. We recognize them as the men from the black 
tTown Car.
<b>t
</b><b>tANGLE
</b><b>t
</b>tThe men have stopped outside Yuri's room. The camera pans and 
twe see Sera down the other corridor getting into the 
televator.
<b>t
</b><b>tFADE OUT:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t77 INT. BEN'S ROOM AT THE MOTEL - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tBen is lying on the bed watching a game show, drinking.
<b>t
</b>tA coughing fit hits him. He is very short of breath. We see 
thow ill he really is.
<b>t
</b>tThere is a tap at the door.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo thanks... I'm fine.
<b>t
</b>tThe tapping persists and eventually Ben gets off the bed and 
tunlocks it, but keeps the chain on. It is Sera.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttStill want to have dinner?
<b>t
</b>tBen stares at her for a while.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI have to change and take a 
ttshower first. If you want to 
ttcome home and wait.
<b>t
</b>tBen opens the door.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWe should pick up a bottle of 
tttequila on the way. I owe you 
ttone.
<b>t 
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou do?
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t78 INT. SERA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tSera is finishing in the shower and Ben is sitting at the 
tkitchen table. He gets up and walks around the house, trying 
tto get a sense of her. The furniture is very plain and there 
tis spartan quality about the hose. He looks with interest at 
tthe bookshelf, which has a good selection of literature. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(to himself)
ttThis is the home of an angel.
<b>t
</b>ttttSERA (off-screen)
ttYou OK out there?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes. Take your time. I'm 
ttfine.
<b>t
</b>tHe pours himself another drink.
<b>t
</b>ttttSERA (off-screen)
ttPour yourself another drink.
<b>t
</b>tHe sots down and she comes in, toweling her hair.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttYou OK?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOf course. Wow... you look 
ttextremely beautiful.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttThank you. What time is it?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttDon't know. My watch went the 
ttway of the car.
<b>t
</b>tHe holds up his empty wrist for her to see. Then looks up and 
tsees her watching him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm rambling. I really like 
ttyou. You make me want to 
tttalk... I don't know what time 
ttit is.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI like hearing you talk.
ttt(businesslike)
ttIf you feel up to a short 
ttwalk, there's a place to eat 
ttaround the corner. All the 
ttfood in Vegas is terrible so 
ttthe place doesn't really 
ttmatter. How does that sound 
ttto you?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttDo they have drinks?
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t79 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tBen and Sera walk and talk.
<b>t
</b><b>t80 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tBen and Sera are eating. He plays with his food, eating very 
tlittle of it. Finally he pushes it away and orders another 
tdrink.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI'm from the East. I went to 
ttcollege, did an arts course. 
ttI now live in Vegas. I think 
ttof it as home. I came here 
ttdeliberately to carve out a 
ttlife. I was in LA before, but 
ttI'll come back to that later.
ttt(pause)
ttThe tough times are behind me 
ttnow. I can deal with the bad 
ttthings that happen. There 
ttwill always be dark 
ttcharacters. But my life is 
ttgood. It is as I would want 
ttit to be. So, why are you a 
ttdrunk? 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttIs that really what you want 
ttto ask me? 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttYes.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(worried)
ttWell, then I guess this is 
ttour first date... or our last. 
ttUntil now, I wasn't sure it 
ttwas either.
<b>tt 
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttVery clever.
<b>t
</b>ttSera thinks for a while and decides to give in to him on 
tthis.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttFirst. It's our first. I'm 
ttjust concerned. So... why are 
ttyou killing yourself?
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttInteresting choice of words. 
ttI don't remember. I just know 
ttthat I want to.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWant to kill yourself? Are 
ttyou saying  that you're 
ttdrinking as a way to kill 
ttyourself?
<b>t
</b>tAnd she leans across the table to be close to him, listening 
tintently. Ben becomes uncomfortable and tries to joke it off. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOr killing myself as a way to 
ttdrink.
<b>t
</b>tSera continues to stare at him, wanting to know the real 
tanswer. He takes a slug from his drink. She sits back.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWe'll talk about it some 
ttother time maybe. OK?
<b>t
</b>tSera relaxes and continues with her food. We hear her 
tthoughts for a moment.
<b>t
</b>ttttSERA (v.o)
ttIt wasn't so important to me. 
ttI mean, he never asked me why 
ttI was a hooker, sand that was 
ttimpressive. I really liked 
tthim. So I decided to just 
ttplay my part. I mean... it's 
ttgood to help someone once in 
tta while., it's a bonus to 
ttbeing alive, and that was my 
ttplan... to stay alive. I 
ttsuddenly came to a decision.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat are you thinking? Are 
ttyou angry with me?
<b>tt 
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>tttt(decides something)
ttBen, why don't you stay at my 
ttplace tonight? I mean... look, 
ttyou're so drunk. I like you. 
ttI trust you.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThat's astonishing. Sera, 
ttlook... 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI hate to think of you in 
ttthat cheesy motel. I mean... 
<b>t
</b>tAnd she folds her arms and grins at him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttLet's face it, what the fuck 
ttare you doing in Las Vegas?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(overwhelmed by her)
ttI'm going to move to a smart 
tthotel, tomorrow if it'll make 
ttyou feel better.
ttt(looks at her)
ttLet's talk about tomorrow. 
ttWanna do something?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttt(warmly)
ttSure... tonight. Then please 
ttstay at my place.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSera... you know I'm not much 
ttgood in the sack.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttIt's not about sex, Ben. I'll 
ttmake you up a bed on the 
ttsofa. Do it for me. We can 
tttalk till late and then sleep 
tttill late. As you know, I am 
ttmy own boss.
<b>tt
</b>tBen laughs loud, the most animated we've seen him, and his 
tlaugh as infectious, and Sera join in. Other diners turn to 
tstare at them. They seem like a couple.
<b>t 
</b><b>tCUT TO:

tLeft to right.
<b>t

</b>t83 INT. SERA'S house - day
<b>t
</b>tBen is asleep on the sofa. As he wakes up, he becomes aware 
tthat Sera is watching him from across the room. They smile at 
teach other.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHow long have I been her?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttThree nights, two days. When 
ttis your rent coming up at the 
ttmotel?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI don't know.
ttt(sits up)
ttI'll go and sort it out 
tttoday. Why don't you 
ttcome?... We'll find a real 
ttroom for me. You can pick it 
ttout, a tower on the strip.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttThere's no reason to blow all 
ttyour money on a hotel room.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBEN
</b>ttWhat do you mean?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWhat I mean is that you 
ttshould bring your stuff over 
tthere. We're spending all this 
tttime together... what the 
ttfuck!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSera... 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttLet's face it, Ben, we're 
tthaving fun here. I've never 
ttdone so much talking in my 
ttlife.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>tttMe neither.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttSo! Let's dispense with the 
ttformalities. I want you 
tthere... now!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSera you are crazy.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttSo... I'm not too concerned 
ttwith long term plans.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttDon't you think you'll get a 
ttlittle bored living with a 
ttdrunk?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttThat is what I want. Why 
ttdon't you go and get your 
ttstuff?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou haven't seen the worst of 
ttit. These last few days I've 
ttbeen very controlled. I knock 
ttthings over... I throw up all 
ttthe time.
ttt(looks at her)
ttNow I feel really 
ttgood... You're like some kind 
ttof antidote that mixes the 
ttliquor and keeps me in 
ttbalance, but that won't last 
ttforever. You'll get tired of 
ttit really quickly. Believe 
ttme.
<b>tt
</b>tThey sit in silence for a while.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttOK, you go back to your hotel 
ttand I'll go back to my 
ttglamorous life of being 
ttalone.
<b>tt
</b>tShe walks out of the room, and into the bathroom, where she 
tsits on the toilet to pee.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttt(to herself)
ttThe only thing I have to come 
tthome to is a bottle of 
ttListerine to wash the taste 
ttof come out of my mouth. I'm 
tttired of being alone... that's 
ttwhat I'm tired of.
<b>tt
</b>tShe finishes, wipes herself and flushes the toilet. Pulling 
tup her panties, she walks back into the bedroom, where Ben is 
tputting on his shoes. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttDon't you like me, Ben?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(devastated)
ttDon't be silly?
<b>t
</b>tBen is unable to deal with the fact that he is absolutely in 
tlove with her. He walks out of the room. She foolows.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWe gotta decide this... right 
ttnow. Before we go any 
ttfurther. You either stay here 
ttwith me or... 
<b>t
</b>tBen turns to look at her.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>tt... we can't see each other 
ttany more.
<b>tt
</b>tBen and Sera look at each other for a long time.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSera... what you don't 
ttunderstand is... 
<b>tt 
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWhat?
<b>t
</b>tBen is deeply troubled. He comes to a decision.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou can never... never... ask 
ttme to stop drinking. Do you 
ttunderstand?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttt(dead serious)
ttI do. I really do.
ttt(smiles)
ttOK. I have to do some 
ttshopping alone. You go out 
ttfor a few drinks and then 
ttpick up your things. Don't 
tthurry and I'll be back before 
ttyou to let you in.
<b>tt
</b>tSera grabs him in a big embrace that knocks him off balance 
tand into the wall. She kisses him all over his face and 
tsqueezes his skinny frame.
<b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t84 INT. BEN'S ROOM AT THE MOTEL - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tBen is packing his liquor into his suitcase. The almost-empty 
tbottles he pours into a large cup, which he drinks from. The 
tsuitcase is now full and Ben suddenly realizes that he hasn't 
tpacked any clothes. They are all in a pile on the bed. He 
ttalks to himself.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttMaybe this isn't a good idea 
ttafter all.
<b>tt
</b>tHe tries to put clothes in with the bottles, but the lid 
twon't close. He sits on the bed and has an imaginary 
tconversation with Sera.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttListen, angel... the thing is 
ttthat I'm nuts about you and 
ttthis is a bad thing... because 
ttmy real plan is to die here 
ttand you were never even part 
ttof my plan... but like I said, 
ttI'm nuts about you... wait a 
ttminute, I have an idea, 
ttangel.
<b>tt
</b>tAnd he opens the closet and finds some plastic laundry bags, 
twhich he puts his clothes in.
<b>t
</b><b>t85 SCENE CUT.
</b><b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:

</b><b>t86 EXT. SERA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tSera's neighbors, a husband and wife, are standing outside 
ther house. They stop her. They are also her landlord.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttHUSBAND
</b>ttWe didn't know whether to 
ttcall the police or not.
<b>t
</b>tAnd they indicate the sleeping figure of Ben, in the doorway, 
tclutching a bottle of bourbon, using hi suitcase as a pillow.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttWIFE
</b>ttHe's been there for about 
tthalf an hour. My husband 
ttthought he'd seen you two 
tttogether, but I thought it 
ttbest to wait until you got 
tthome.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttYes, he's my friend. I guess 
tthe just had a little too much 
ttto drink.
ttt(smiling uncomfortably)
ttI'll help him inside.
ttt(puts down her packages)
ttThanks for the concern. Sorry 
ttto trouble you.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttHUSBAND
</b>ttt(gallantly)
ttWell, call me if there's 
ttanything I can do.
<b>tt
</b>tThey go to their own house. Sera opens the front door, kneels 
tdown next to Ben and shakes him gently.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttCan you wake up?
<b>t
</b>tBen opens his eyes and looks around with a pleasant, cheerful 
texpression.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHi!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWhy don't you go in and sit 
ttdown. I have some gifts for 
ttyou.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttRight... OK... 
<b>t
</b>tBen stands and almost loses his balance. He picks up his 
tsuitcase and attempts to pick up her packages as well, but 
tshe stop him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttDon't worry... I got'em.
<b>t
</b>tBen staggers in with his case. As Sera enters, she looks 
taround and sees Husband and Wife at the window, still 
twatching.
<b>t
</b>ttttBEN (off-screen)
tttWant a drink? Great nap. 
ttWanna go out tonight?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttSeriously, Ben... I need to 
ttkeep pretty low-key around 
tthere. Maybe next time you 
ttcould nap this side of the 
ttdoor. That was the landlord.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOf course.
<b>t
</b>tShe reaches into her purse.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttGift number one.
<b>t
</b>tAnd she gives him a newly cut key. He takes it and tries it 
tin the lock, then drops it into his pocket.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI used to carry a lot of 
ttkeys, but one by one they all 
ttfell victim to the great 
ttcondensation. Now I have just 
ttthis one... which is... 
<b>tt
</b>tAnd he tails off and stares at the floor. She waits for him 
tto continue and then comes to him and touches him on the arm.
<b>t
</b><b>t87 INT. SERA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttBen?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSorry.
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI was miles away.
<b>t
</b>tHe sees the parcels.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttAh... more gifts. I have to 
ttsit down for this.
<b>t
</b>tHe strides into the living room and flops on to the sofa. She 
tfollows.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSera, I love that

ttproceed onwards, there is 
ttsomething I need to say. OK?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b><b>ttOK.
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI've come this far... here I 
ttam, in your house. I want you 
ttto let me pay the rent for 
ttthis month. All right?
<b>tt
</b>tAnd he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen 
tuntil this matter is resolved.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWhy?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBecause... it's better for me 
ttthat way. OK?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWell... OK... 
<b>t
</b>tShe is uncomfortable.
<b>t
</b>tThey sit in silence for a while.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSera... I hope that you 
ttunderstand how I feel about 
ttthis. First of all, you're 
ttwelcome to my money. We can 
ttbuy a couple of cases of 
ttliquor and you can have the 
ttrest. But I don't think 
ttyou're talking to me right 
ttnow about money.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttNo?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo. I think you're talking 
ttabout you. I'll tell you 
ttright now that I'm in love 
ttwith you... but, be that as it 
ttmay, I'm not here to force my 
tttwisted life into your soul.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI know that... 
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>tt... and I'm not here to demand 
ttyour attention to the point 
ttwhere it changes your life. 
ttWe know I'm a drunk... but 
ttthat seems to be all right 
ttwith you. And I know that 
ttyou're a hooker. I hope you 
ttunderstand that I'm a person 
ttwho is totally at ease with 
ttthis... which is not to say 
ttthat I'm indifferent or that 
ttI don't care... I do... it 
ttsimply means that I trust and 
ttaccept your judgement. What 
ttI'm saying is... that I hope 
ttyou understand that I 
ttunderstand.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttThanks, I do understand. I 
ttwas worried about how that 
ttwould be... but now I'm not. 
ttAnd you should know that 
ttincluded with the rent here 
ttis a complimentary blow job.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttAh, yes... I suppose sooner or 
ttlater we ought to fuck.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWhatever that means. Open 
ttyour presents.
<b>t
</b>tShe hands him the larger of the two parcels.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttOpen this one first.
<b>t
</b>tBen awkwardly unwraps the present, a large, colorful shirt. A 
tgenuine smile comes on to his face.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttVery nice.
<b>t
</b>tHe holds the shirt against himself.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThis should work very nicely 
ttwith my suit, which, by the 
ttway, is the only item of 
ttclothing I brought over from 
ttthe motel with me.
<b>ttt
</b>tSera raise an eyebrow.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttRight... the suitcase was 
ttclinking. So what did you do 
ttwith your clothes?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(laughing)
ttI threw them into the 
ttgarbage., which was perhaps 
ttimmoral, but I wanted to come 
ttto you clean, so to speak. I 
ttthought we could go shopping 
ttand pick up a pair of jeans 
ttand forty-five pairs of 
ttunderwear and just throw them 
ttout each day.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttNice talk, Ben. Keep 
ttdrinking. In between the 
tthundred and one proof breath 
ttand the occasional drool, 
ttsome interesting words fall 
ttfrom your mouth.
<b>tt
</b>tShe hands him the last present.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttNow, try this one.
<b>t
</b>tBen unwraps the smallest gift. It is a silver hip flask. He 
tis very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek.
<b>t 
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell... looks like I'm with 
ttthe right girl.
<b>tt
</b>tHe turns it in his hands.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI must say that I'm very 
ttimpressed that you would buy 
ttthis for me. I know you 
ttwouldn't do this without 
ttthinking about it. 
ttFunny... you did just what I 
ttwould have done.
<b>tt
</b>tBen stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit. It is 
tfine. He walks to the door.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEN
</b>ttI'm going to fill it right 
ttnow.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttDo you want to go gambling 
tttonight? We could go out and 
ttplay for a few hours.
<b>tt
</b>tBen comes back into the room, takes the flask out of his suit 
tpocket and has a drink.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI hadn't planned to 
ttgamble... but if you would 
ttkeep the bulk of my money 
tthere, then I could safely

ttt(pause)
ttI'm going to change. Watch

<b>t

tis not sure if he offended her or not. He watches through the

ttalk.

<b>t

</b>ttt(laughs)
ttWhat do you mean?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI expect some kind of loyalty 
tthere. Just because I fuck for

</b><b>t89 INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tThey walk around the huge space, which is full of people and 
tenergy, and suddenly Ben grabs Sera and pushes her against a 
tslot machine and kisses her deeply. At first she resists and 
tthen she gives in to him and responds. They knock over some 
tchange, which falls to the floor, and Ben pulls from her a 
tbeat to bend down and scoop up all the change and hand it to 
tthe bemused player, before returning to Sera's mouth or more. 
tThey break for air and then Ben leads her towards the bar. As 
the waves to attract the barman's attention, she squeezes his 
tarm.

ttI love you.

ttseems to fall asleep. Sera tries to wake him and then he goes

twith Sera.

ta soft glow. He rolls off the sofa, landing on all fours on 
tthe floor. He crawls to the kitchen , opens the fridge door 
tand takes out a vodka bottle and carton of orange juice. With 
tdifficulty he gets to his feet, finds a glass and pour s a

</b>ttVery well... umm... I never

ttthis again... but how did our

ttgetting to the casino... I 
ttremember kissing you... that 
ttwas really nice but 
tteverything after that is a 
ttblank.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWell - I was prepared for 
ttworse, but it wasn't so bad. 
ttWe were sitting at the bar, 
tttalking about blackjack. You 
ttseemed just fine, a little 
ttdrunker than usual, but 
ttnothing really strange, but 
ttthen your head started to 
ttdroop and I put my arm on 
ttyour shoulder and then, wham, 
ttyou swung you arm at me, and 
ttfell backwards off your stool 
ttinto a cocktail waitress. You 
ttsmashed everything on her 
tttray, it was a real mess. You 
ttkept yelling and yelling.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh, and what did you do?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI tried to shut you up and 
tthelp you to your feet but you 
ttkept swinging at me - not

ttbut more just waving me away. 
ttSecurity came and when you 
ttsaw them you stopped yelling. 
ttThey wanted to carry you out 
ttand dump you on the street, 
ttbut I talked them into 
ttletting me walk you out.
<b>tt

</b>ttThat's impressive. How did 
ttyou do that?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI told them you were an

ttWhat happened then?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttYou were OK for a while, so 
ttwe walked for about a block 
ttand then you said you wanted 
ttto go home and fuck, but I 
ttthink even you knew that 
ttwasn't going to happen. We 
ttgot a cab and you asked him 
ttto stop at a liquor store, 
tteven though I told you that 
ttwe had plenty at home. In the 
ttstore you gave the kid a 
tthundred and told him to keep 
ttthe change. I asked you if 
ttyou knew it was a hundred. 
ttYou said you did, so I let 
ttyou do it. We got here, you 
ttfell asleep on the couch and 
ttI covered you up and came to 
ttbed.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI warned you... 
ttt(kisses her hand)
tt... but I'm sorry.
<b>t

</b>ttHere's my speech... 
ttt(kisses his hand)
tt... I know this shouldn't be 
ttacceptable to m, but it is. 
ttDon't ask me why. I sense 
ttthat your trouble is very 
ttbig... and I'm scared for 
ttyou... and so I'm doing what I 
ttthink you need me to do. 
ttFalling down in casinos is 
ttlittle stuff. It doesn't 
ttbother me. It has nothing to 
ttdo with us.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThat's amazing. What are you? 
ttSome sort of angel visiting 
ttme from one of my drunk 
ttfantasies? How can you be so 
ttgood?
<b>tt
</b>tShe turns away to the wall and curls up like a small girl.
<b>t

</b>ttI don't know what you're 
ttsaying. I'm just using you. I 
ttneed you. Can we not talk 
ttabout it any more, please. 
ttNot another word.
<b>tt
</b>tHe thinks about this. He gently pushes her until she is lying 
ton her front and then he pulls up her nightdress and strokes 
ther naked back. He kisses her in the small of her back.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhy don't you go back to

tsees something and exits frame.

</b><b>t
</b>tBen enters and makes his way to the bar. This is a dirty, 
tdark place. An ageing blonde in leather hot pants is dancing 
tby herself at the jukebox. A very drunk Biker Couple argue 
tnoisily in a corner, slurring their words. There ins not much 
tgambling taking place at the eight slot machines. Ben sits at 
tthe bar and the Bartender slaps down a paper napkin.
<b>t

</b>ttA beer and a double kamikaze 
ttplease.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBARTENDER
</b>ttSure thing. Anything to eat?

<b>tt
</b>tThe Bartender walks away to get Ben's drinks, Ben continues 
tanyway.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>tt... then I'll go home with the 
ttgroceries and we'll have 
ttbreakfast together, and 
ttthat'll make her feel better 
ttabout my condition... 
<b>tt
</b>tBen is interrupted by the arrival of the Biker Girl. She is 
tyoung tough and pretty. She puts an arm around him and 
tpresses against him.
<b>tt

ttt(laughing)
ttWhy are you all dressed up,

</b>ttFuck you. Don't fuck with me,

<b>t
</b>tThe Biker walks over to the slot machine and begins dropping 
tin quarters, never taking his eyes off Ben and the Girl.
<b>t

</b>ttSee what an asshole he is.
ttt(big smile)
ttI'll have a rum and Coke.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBarman? A rum and Coke,

<b>t
</b>tThe Girl leans with her back to the bar, closer to Ben , who  
tis facing the bar on a stool. She brings her face closer to 
this.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBIKER GIRL
</b>ttCan I stay with you for a

<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou mean move in with me? 
ttIsn't this a bit sudden?

</b>ttOh, I don't have a lot of

ttI don't think my wife would 
ttdig it too much.
<b>t
</b>tShe moves to his ear to whisper.
<b>t

</b>ttMaybe we could just go find a 
ttroom and fuck all day. You 
ttwouldn't have to tell your 
ttwife about that, would you? I 
ttcould suck you like this.
<b>tt
</b>tAnd she begins sucking on his lobe. Behind them. At the slot 
tmachine the Biker is still watching. His face fills with a 
tdrunken rage.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSee, the thing is... fucking 
ttyou would be wonderful, but I 
ttam deeply in love with 
ttSera... 
<b>tt
</b>tThe Biker throws down his beer can and walks towards the bar.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>tt... and it's almost impossible 
ttfor me to imagine being with 
ttsomeone else... 
<b>tt
</b>tThe Biker arrives at the bar and grabs Ben.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBIKER
</b>ttNow listen, asshole, I'm not 
ttgonna just sit around and 
ttwatch her suck on your ear.

</b>tThe Biker is about to hit Ben then holds back. He leans in 
tand puts his face next to Ben's.
<b>t

</b>ttNow, I know that she came

ttGet lost, jerk.
<b>t
</b>tThe Biker slaps her and then grabs Ben by the collar.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBIKER
</b>ttWhat do you say?
<b>t
</b>tBen shakes his arm free from the Biker's grip. He thinks 
tabout it for a couple of beats and then decides.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm sorry... but she and I 
tthave decided to spend a few 
tthours together in a mo -
<b>tt
</b>tThe Biker headbutts Ben in the face, sending him crashing off 
this stool to the floor. His head cracks against the tiled 
tfloor. The Biker walks over to him, picks him up by his shirt 
tfront and punches him in the nose. Blood sprays on to his 
tface. The Biker walks out of the bar. The Girl follows him 
tquickly. The Bartender takes a wet towel and walks over to 
twhere Ben is struggling to get up, holding his face. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBARTENDER
</b>ttYou're quite a fighter.
<b>t
</b>tHe gives him the towel.
<b>t

tfrom poolside.

</b>ttOh, no! Oh, fuck, Ben, look 
ttat your face. You get in a

ttDid you stop at the bar?

</b>ttAbsolutely not... ow... I was 
ttdefending the honor of some

<b>tt
</b>tShe thinks about this for a moment and then kisses him on the 
tforehead.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWhy don't you go and finish 
ttthis in the bathroom. Take a

ttyou a black bow tie and you 
ttcan look like one of those

ttwear it because they have to. 
ttI wear it because I want to.

tMothers with children, old people and a Waitress with

tdoesn't bring it straight away. People begin staring. At the

tand holds up the empty glass to let the waitress know she 
tshould bring another.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOpen it.
<b>t

the is reacting. She smiles and Ben takes a deep swallow, 
tfinishing his drink. His mood suddenly changes.

</b>ttYears ago, in LA, I turned a 
tttrick on Sunset and Western. 
ttThe guy was polite and didn't 
ttargue about the price. He 
ttparked his car and I took him 
ttto a house that I had an 
ttarrangement with. A fat 
ttMexican woman was watching a 
ttTV and I told him to give her 
ttthe twenty for the room. 
ttThere were three or four 
ttsmall naked children playing 
tton the floor and we had to 
ttstep over them to get into 
ttthe room. The room had a bed 
ttand a dresser. He lay on his 
ttback on the bed and I put a 
ttrubber on him and sucked him 
ttfor a while until he was hard 
ttand then I eased on to him. 
ttAbout twenty minutes later 
ttthere was a knock on the door 
ttand it was the woman saying 
ttour time was up. I felt kind 
ttof guilty because he hadn't 
ttcome and I offered to reason 
ttwith the woman and get 
ttanother ten minutes, but he 
ttsaid it was all right and 
ttbegan dressing. When we were 
ttready to leave the room he 
ttstopped me and... hugged me 
ttand kissed me on the cheek. 
ttHe gave me an extra hundred 
ttas a tip and went back to his

ttrelieved that I wouldn't have 
ttto work again that evening.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttLast spring I happened to 
ttwalk past a house that I had 
ttonce patronized. There was a 
ttcool breeze blowing off the 
ttocean and through the window 
ttI could see a bare leg. The 
ttgirl must have been taking a 
ttbreak between customers. It 
ttwas a strange moment for me 
ttbecause it reminded me of my 
ttmother and despite the fact 
ttthat I was late for something 
ttalready I just stayed there, 
ttloving the atmosphere of it 
ttand my memory and... the 
ttreason I'm telling you  this 
ttepilogue is that I felt that 
ttI'd come full circle.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttWhere was that house? The one 
ttin LA, I mean.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttFifth and Mayflower. You know 
ttit?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttSERA
</b>ttYes. One of my friends was 
ttthere. I wonder if you ever 
ttclipped her.
<b>tt
</b>tThey watch the TV in silence for a while. Sera holds his 
thand.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI like it here with you.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttLet's stay for a while.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b><b>ttOK.
</b><b>t
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>t107 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tBen mixes a cocktail for himself, then one for Sera. The 
tcamera follows him as he goes...  
<b>t
</b><b>t108 EXT. POOL-SIDE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>t... to the side of the pool, where Sera is sunbathing. He 
tlowers himself unsteadily into the chair but avoids spilling 
ta drop of the drinks, which he puts down on to a glass-topped 
ttable. He is pretty loaded. Sera turns over and moves out of 
this shadow.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttI've missed the best sun. Why 
ttdid you have to pawn your 
ttwatch?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI didn't know I'd ever need 
ttit again.
<b>t
</b>tSera gets up, takes a drink and then walks to the diving 
tboard. As she takes a position at the end, she pulls the 
tbathing suit out from her bottom, does a very natural dive 
tinto the pool, swims a length under water and then comes out 
tnear Ben, pulls herself out of the pool in one move and bends 
tdown and kisses Ben for a long time. Ben responds and kisses 
tback. There is no one else around the pool.
<b>t
</b>tThe kiss becomes heated and urgent and Sera sits on Ben, 
tmaking him wet from her. He pushes the top of her suit down 
tand kisses her breasts. She picks up the glass and drinks, 
tletting the alcohol spill from her mouth, over her breasts. 
tBen drinks from her.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttBEN
</b>ttTake this off.
<b>t
</b>tHe tries to pull her swimsuit down.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttMaybe we should go inside. 
ttCome on.
<b>t
</b>tShe stands up, covering herself. Ben stands up, laughing, 
tloses his balance and slips on the wet concrete. He falls 
tbackwards, half on to the chair, which he breaks, and then on 
tto the glass table. The table goes over and it and the 
tglasses all shatter on the concrete. Ben falls on the broken 
tglass and cuts himself all over his back and his arms. Glass 
tgoes into the pool. Blood mingles with the water on the 
tsteaming cement.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhoops.
<b>t
</b>tSera picks up her towel and lays it down next to him. She 
tkneels and helps him up, trying to pullout the little bits of 
tglass sticking to him. Ben stands unsteadily.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'll go and clean up. Perhaps 
ttyou could take care of this. 
<b>t
</b>tHe indicates the mess, then walks to their room. Sera begins 
tcarefully picking up the broken glass. The desk clerc appears 
twith a broom and a dustpan.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDESK-CLERK
</b>ttt(cheerfully)
ttEverybody OK?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttYes, fine. Don't worry. We'll 
ttpay for the chair, and I'll 
ttclean all this up, the pool 
tttoo.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDESK-CLERK
</b>ttDon't worry.
<b>t
</b>tHe begins sweeping the broken glass into the pan, cheerfully 
tignoring Sera.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttYou seem prepared for 
ttaccidents.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDESK-CLERK
</b>ttt(still smiling)
ttYeah... we get a lot of screw-
ttups here.
<b>t
</b>tHe looks directly at Sera.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDESK-CLERK
</b>ttNow, you two keep you loud 
tttalk and your liquor to your 
ttroom. Check out first thing 
tttomorrow and after that I 
ttdon't want to see either of 
ttyou here again. I don't need 
ttyou paying for the chair or 
ttcutting your pretty hands on 
ttthe glass. Let's leave it at 
ttthat.
<b>tt
</b>tNodding firmly, he goes back to the mess, indicating that the 
tconversation is over.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDESK-CLERK
</b>ttSee ya in the morning.

<b>t
</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttBen?
<b>t
</b>tShe sees that he is already asleep on the bed, his half-naked 
tbody covered with countless bits of bloodstained tissue. The 
timage has an almost religious feel to it. The TV is on and a 
tsitcom is playing.
<b>t
</b>tSomething funny catches Sera's attention. She laughs and sits 
ton the bed next to Ben.
<b>t
</b>ttttSERA (voice-over)
ttI think we realized that we 
ttdidn't have long and accepted 
ttit. My charm, for him, was 
ttthat I accepted him exactly 
ttas he was and didn't expect 
tthim to change. I think we 
ttboth realized that about each 
ttother. Ben needed me and I 
ttliked his drama. I loved him.

ttright now, but I bought some 
ttplain rice. I thought it

</b><b>t
</b>tBen's hands are sweating and it's difficult for him to keep 
thold of the bottle as he drinks. He gets most of it down and 
tthen he hunches over the sink and immediately vomits. He 
ttakes the second bottle and tries again.
<b>t

tShe has a bowl of vegetables and rice. She sits, silently for 
ta while, and then puts down her chopsticks.

</b>tShe folds her arms.

tlook right into each other's eyes.

</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSera... I'm not going to see a 
ttdoctor.
<b>t
</b>tSera continues to look at him almost defiantly.
<b>t

</b><b>ttttSERA
</b>ttAnd do what... rot away in a

ttt(becoming angry)
ttWe're not going to talk about

tttOne thing... one thing... this

ttalive.
<b>t

</b><b>t

ttable... and wins. As he leans forward to collect his 
twinnings, he sees... 
<b>t
</b><b>tANGLE:
</b><b>t
</b>t... a Blonde in a very low-cut outfit. She smiles at Ben and 
twalks around the table to pick him up. Ben puts all of his 
twinnings on one bet and wins again. This pattern repeats a 
tfew times and drinks are on the house.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBLONDE
</b>ttHey... that was quite a play. 
ttYou in for the convention?
<b>t
</b>tBen gets to the point.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'd like to fuck you.
<b>t
</b>tA few people hear Ben and the Blonde is almost put off, but 
the does have about eight thousand dollars in winnings and so 
tshe leans in very close so that she can talk quietly.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBLONDE
</b>ttI'm very expensive.

</b>tIn one fluid movement the naked blonde gets off the semi-
tconscious Ben, pulls her dress over her head and walks past 
tSera. Moments later we hear the front door slam. Ben comes to 
tand looks at Sera. He is more or less unaware of what has 
tjust happened.

tbedside table and stands.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttPerhaps I could crash on the 
ttcouch for a few hours... and 
ttthen I'll leave.
<b>t
</b>tHe walks out of the room and closes his the door. Camera 
tmoves in on Sera. She covers her face with her hands. She 
tdrops her purse and slides down the wall to the floor, 
tweeping quietly.

thuddle before walking over to her.
<b>t

</b>ttHow much will it cost us to 
ttfuck you?

tmoment later the Tallest College Boy opens the door in his 
tjockey shorts.
<b>t
</b><b>t127 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tSera steps in. One boy is coming out of the bathroom wearing 
ta towel and the third is sitting in a chair smoking a 
tcigarette, which he passes to the boy in the towel. The other 
tboy is fooling around with a video camera. The atmosphere is 
tweird and Sera is suddenly alert.
<b>t
</b>tThe Tallest College Boy hands her the money. He is very well 
tbuilt, a football player. Sera hesitates, holding the money. 
tThe Tallest College Boy closes the door and then leans 
tagainst it. They are all staring at her now. No one says 
tanything. Sera smiles suddenly and puts the money in her 
tpurse. All business.

ttMaybe you'd like to fuck one

<b>t
</b><b>t137 INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tSera comes to an elevator and waits. She is wearing a thin 
tblack top without a bra. Her bruised face makes her suddenly 
tvery conspicuous and vulnerable. A big man in a white stetson 
tstands next to her. He looks at her and grins. She smiles, 
tcoldly. He takes from his pocket two black, hundred dollar 
tchips, places one in each hand and deliberately places each 
tone against her nipples. Other people see this and stop and 
twatch. Sera looks down at his hands and stares until the man 
tbecomes uncomfortable.

tsomewhat revealing. Opposite her a bum is sleeping on the 
tpavement. For a moment it looks like Ben. The camera comes in 
ttight on to her face. She looks more lost that we've ever 
tseen her. She drinks coffee from a styrofoam cup. The sun is
