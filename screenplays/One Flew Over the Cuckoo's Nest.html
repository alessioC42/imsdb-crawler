<b>EXT. WORK FARM - NIGHTFALL
</b>
All we SEE is an ELEVATED SHOT of the distant mountains,
rolling landscape and McMURPHY -- one cheek laid-open and
crusted over with dried blood, his face and prison work
clothes caked with dried sweat and dust -- as he sits on the
very top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight.

A long moment passes before McMurphy's attention is drawn
elsewhere and he looks down.

REVERSE SHOT - McMURPHY'S POV

Far below, in the prison yard a MAN is SEEN hurrying acrcss
the yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed
prison guards, officials, and medics -- a stretcher, an
ambulance, a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the
base of the water tower. The man is seen talking to the
officials, then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look
up at McMurphy.

McMURPHY

As he looks down at them, a searchlight is turned on him.

<b>tttMAN (V.O.)
</b>tt(through bullhorn)
tMcMurphy! This is Doctor Shankle,
tfrom the infirmary. Can you hear
tme?

McMurphy doesn't respond.

<b>tttSHANKLE (V.O.)
</b>tt(through bullhorn)
tCan you hear me, McMurphy?

McMurphy doesn't respond. Another searchlight goes on as a
SECOND VOICE is PICKED UP on the BULLHORN.

<b>tttSECOND VOICE
</b>tt(through bullhorn)
tWhy don't we blast 'im, for Christ
tsake, he ain't gonna come down...
tyou...

The BULLHORN is TURNED OFF. A long moment passes as McMurphy
continues to squat on the tower and wait. He shivers against
the coming night when...

<b>tttSHANKLE (V.O.)
</b>tt(through bullhorn)
tMcMurphy!
tI have the warden's promise. If you
tcome down, nobody will hurt you!
tYou'll be in my custody! I promise!

An imperceptible smile appears on McMurphy's face.

<b>INT. MEN'S DORM - OREGON STATE HOSPITAL - DAWN
</b>
Strange HUMMING SOUNDS, CLANKING PIPES and HISSING RADIATORS
as we see beds, with patients lying asleep, line two walls.
The third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill, with a door that
opens on to the day room. The door is open. On the far side
of the day room, a long hallway with other doors opening into
rooms: the latrine, washroom, tub room, mess hall, seclusion
room, psychiatrist's office, visitors' room, etc.

Across the day room, a glass enclosed nurses' station where
TURKLE, a Negro night attendant, is seen preparing to go off
duty.

The CAMERA PANS the beds in the men's dorm. One man turns,
another twists, a third lies as if dead.

CAMERA PAN ENDS on BROMDEN, who lies still, eyes wide open,
very alert. He reaches down, plucks a stale piece of gum from
under the bed frame, puts it in his mouth and starts chewing.

A beat, then Bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which
binds him to the bed. He slips out of bed and quietly makes
his way down the aisle, paying no attention to the other
patients, some of who are beginning to stir awake.

Ahead, at the end of the hallway, the door opens and three
Negro day attendants, WASHINGTON, WARREN and MILLER, dressed
in white uniforms, enter and move down the hallway and
disappear into a side room.

Bromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as
Turkle emerges from the side door to the nurses' lounge, goes
up the hallway as MISS PILBOW, the day nurse, comes in,
passing Turkle on the way out. She crosses to the nurses'
station and enters as Bromden reaches the day room.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
</b>
as Bromden makes his way across the day room, past the
nurses' station, unnoticed by Miss Pilbow who is busy
preparing the day's medication.

Bromden is sliding along the hallway wall, when he is
suddenly cut off by a mop which THUDS against one side of his
neck. A second mop yokes him on the other side. Bromden
freezes. Terrified.

<b>tttMILLER
</b>tWhere you goin', Chief?

<b>tttWARREN
</b>tYou goin' t'see the Big White
tFathuh?

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tHe goin' t'see the Big White
tMuthuh...

They cackle, legs jiving, as the ammonia stings Bromden's
eyes and burns his nose. He tries to twist his head, but
Washington jams the mop harder. Bromden freezes, panic
spreading across his face.

<b>tttWASHINGTON (CONT'D)
</b>tHaw, look at 'im, big 'nough to eat
tapples off my head an' he mine me
tlike a baby...

A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock in the main door. Washington
very adroitly releases Bromden, hands him the mop, and turns,
along with Warren and Miller, to their duties, as BIG NURSE
enters the ward.

<b>tttTHREE ATTENDANTS
</b>tt(simultaneously, as Big
ttNurse passes)
tMornin', Miss Ratched...

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tGood morning, boys.

She sweeps by and disappears into the nurses' station. The
three attendants put their mops and rags aside and start
towards the men's dorm, leaving Bromden pressed against the
wall, mop in hand.

<b>INT. NURSES' STATION
</b>
as Big Nurse enters to be greeted by Miss Pilbow, who wears
an enormous cross between her breasts.

<b>tttMISS PILBOW
</b>tGood morning, Miss Ratched. It's a
tbeautiful day, isn't it?

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tMean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean
told Monday...
tt(she flips on the
ttintercom)
tGood morning, boys. Rise and shine.
tRise and shine.

<b>INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY
</b>
as Washington, Warren and Miller roust the patients out of
bed.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (V.O.)
</b>tt(through loudspeaker)
tTime to get up! Come on now, it's a
tbeautiful day! Let's not straggle!
tEverybody up, up, up!

The Chronics are physically helped out of bed as the Acutes,
who can handle themselves, cross out into the Day Room,
rubbing the sleep out of their eyes. Big Nurse steps out of
the Nurses' Station. Washington and Warren are hustling the
patients toward the washroom.

Miller stays behind, stripping Blastic's bed and rolling up
his mattress.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
</b>
as the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tGood morning, Mister Sefelt... Good
tmorning, Mister Fredrickson. Good
tmorning, Billy, I spoke to your
tmother last night and she sends her
tlove... Good morning, Mister
tHarding... Good morning, Mister
tCheswick. Mister Scanlon...

Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction.
Big Nurse takes his hand and reaches up and pats his face.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tOh, Mister Bromden...
tt(calling out)
tMister Washington!

Washington comes running.

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tYes, Miss Ratched?

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tMister Washington, why don't we get
ta good head start on the day by
tshaving Mister Bromden and see if
twe can't avoid a disturbance.

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tt(taking Bromden by the
tthand)
tYes, Miss Ratched...

<b>INT. WASHROOM - DAY
</b>
The patients are busy washing and shaving.

Warren is assisting a vegetable wash himself as Washington
guides Bromden through a cage-like partition... where an
antique barber chair stands.

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tt(calling as he goes)
tWarren!

He sits Bromden down and straps his bands and legs in, then
plugs the electric shaver in and turns it on and brings the
BUZZING instrument towards Bromden's face. Bromden turns
away.

<b>tttWASHINGTON (CONT'D)
</b>tt(shouting out)
tGet your black ass in here!

Warren props the vegetable up against the sink.

<b>tttWARREN
</b>tTha's it... be right back!

Warren leaves; the old man starts sliding.

<b>tttttQUICK CUT TO:
</b>
<b>BROMDEN
</b>
as Warren enters and takes a firm grip on Bromden's head and
Washington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO
EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the
BUZZING SOUND of the electric razor INTENSIFIES until it is
<b>INSUPPORTABLE.
</b>
<b>tttttQUICK CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
</b>
No sound as we SEE Big Nurse watch the last few patients file
past the side door to the Nurses' Station where Miss Pilbow
hands out little cups with pills. Washington stands by,
checking to see each man takes his pills before filling their
cups with orange juice.
The last patient takes his pills and returns to his place in
the Day Room. Miss Pilbow closes the window.

Satisfied that all is well, Big Nurse turns on an old 45
record player with a stack of records, then she settles down
to her work as a SOFT, NOSTALGIC NUMBER from the '40's is
HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW PAN of the Day
Room.

The patients, under the influence of drugs, have settled down
for the day. HARDING is playing cards with MARTINI, CHESWICK
and BILLY. SEFELT and FREDRICKSON are putting a jigsaw puzzle
together in brotherly love. SORENSEN is off by himself,
rubbing his hands clean. TABER, pencil in hand, sits
pondering over a blank piece of paper. SCANLON paces back and
forth. On the Chronics' side of the room, RUCKLY is turning a
grimy photograph over in his hands. BANCINI sits wagging his
head, mumbling over and over, "Tired, awful tired..." ELLIS
stands against the wall, arms outstretched, hands nailed to
the wall by imaginary nails.

Bromden is pushing a mop around. 

Washington, Warren and Miller are in the men's dorm making up
the Chronics' beds when O.S. the TELEPHONE RINGS.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY
</b>
as Miss Pilbow picks up the phone.

<b>tttMISS PILBOW
</b>tEighty-two, Miss Pilbow speaking...
tYes...
tt(she makes a note and
tthangs it)
t... New admission, Miss Ratched...

Miss Pilbow goes to the mirror, quickly preens herself, then
turns and flips the intercom on.

<b>tttMISS PILBOW (CONT'D)
</b>tt(over loudspeaker)
tMister Washington! Mister Warren!

She exits.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. DAY ROOM
</b>
as Miss Pilbow exits nurses' station and heads down the
hallway, Washington and Warren on her heels. Miller looking
wistfully after them.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MAIN ENTRANCE - STATE HOSPITAL - DAY
</b>
Staff personnel are SEEN moving in and out of the main
entrance where a state penitentiary car is parked. A DEPUTY
SHERIFF leans on the fender smoking a cigarette as SECOND
DEPUTY SHERIFF comes out of the building and motions down to
First Deputy, who crushes his cigarette out, then opens the
rear door to the car.

<b>tttDEPUTY SHERIFF
</b>tt(to an unseen occupant)
tOkay, let's go.

A long beat, then McMurphy slowly emerges from the car. He's
wearing handcuffs and dressed in faded jeans, flannel work
shirt, leather jacket, black motorcycle cap, and heavy black
boots. He's been scrubbed clean and has a Band-Aid on his
cheek. McMurphy does a couple of knee bends to get the kinks
out of his legs as Deputy reaches in the car and takes out a
small gym bag containing McMurphy's belongings.

<b>tttDEPUTY SHERIFF (CONT'D)
</b>tLet's move it...

McMurphy goes up the stairs, followed by the Deputy, and
crosses into the building.

<b>INT. MAIN BUILDING - DAY
</b>
as McMurphy enters the building followed by the Deputies,
where Nurse Pilbow, McMurphy's folder in hand, and Washington
and Warren stand waiting -- all in a pleasant, receptive
mood. First Deputy hands McMurphy's gym bag to Washington,
who hands it to Warren.

<b>tttSECOND DEPUTY
</b>tOkay, this is it!

McMurphy turns and holds out his hands. As cuffs are removed,
McMurphy impulsively takes hold of the Deputy's head and
plants a kiss on his forehead.

<b>tttSECOND DEPUTY (CONT'D)
</b>tt(squirming out of
ttMcMurphy's grasp)
tJesus, you're crazy, McMurphy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYeah, ain't that the truth.

<b>tttDEPUTY SHERIFF
</b>tt(to Miss Pilbow)
tHe's all yours, Miss.

<b>tttMISS PILBOW
</b>tThank you, Officer...

The two Deputies start down the stairs.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tSo long, fellas...

The two Deputies merely shrug their backs at McMurphy who
takes a deep breath of fresh air.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (CONT'D)
</b>tYes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall
tday...

<b>tttMISS PILBOW
</b>tThis way, Mister McMurphy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYes, ma'am...

McMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow into the hallway as the door
closes behind them.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Other STAFF MEMBERS are administrative personnel are SEEN as
McMurphy walks alongside Nurse Pilbow, who is noticeably
nervous by his close proximity. Washington and Warren
casually bringing up the rear.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(as he peels the Band-Aid
ttoff, revealing a scar)
tI tell ya, these goons showered me
tat the courthouse this morning,
tlast night at the jail, and I swear
tthey'd have swabbed my ears out on
tthe way over if they could've found
tthe facilities...

A young Japanese nurse, named ITSU, passes by.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (CONT'D)
</b>tt(to Nurse Itsu)
tHey, how ya doin', cutie?

<b>tttNURSE ITSU
</b>tOkay. How you doing?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tJust great!
tt(calling after her)
tSee ya around!

Nurse Itsu laughs and disappears around the corner.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (CONT'D)
</b>tt(to Nurse Pilbow)
tYes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my
tstay here.

<b>tttMISS PILBOW
</b>tI'm sure you will.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Nurse Pilbow)
tYa know, I ain't never been in an
tinstitution of psychology before.

<b>tttMISS PILBOW
</b>tOh...

They arrive at the ward door. Nurse Pilbow unlocks the door
and opens it as...

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYeah, I'm here on a ninety-day
tobservation period. Short-timer,
tlike they say...

Soft nostalgic MUSIC is HEARD OVER.

<b>tttMISS PILBOW
</b>tOf course.
tt(indicating door)
tMister McMurphy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tAfter you, ma'am.

<b>tttMISS PILBOW
</b>tThank you.

Nurse Pilbow enters the ward and McMurphy watches her cross
the visitors' area to a heavy-gauge steel screen wall, with
security gate which she opens.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Washington and Warren
ttas they step into ward)
tMan, there sure is an awful lot of
tpoontang around here.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tt(calling)
tHold it!

McMurphy turns to see DOCTOR SPIVEY approaching.

<b>tttSPIVEY (CONT'D)
</b>tGood morning, boys.

<b>tttWASHINGTON AND WARREN
</b>tt(simultaneously as Spivey
ttpasses into the ward)
tMornin', Doctor Spivey.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tGreat day for fishing.

<b>tttWASHINGTON AND WARREN
</b>tt(simultaneously)
tYes, sir!

The door closes. CAMERA HOLDS on sign that READS: 

<b>SMILE AT THE NEXT FACE YOU SEE. IT MAY SAVE HIS LIFE.
</b>
<b>tttMCMURPHY (O.S.)
</b>tYeah, I was just thinking the same
tthing, Doc...

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. WARD - DAY
</b>
as McMurphy, Spivey, Washington and Warren cross the
visitors' area towards Nurse Pilbow, who stands holding the
security gate open. At the far end of the hallway, which
opens into the day room, patients can be seen.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tt(to McMurphy)
tOh, what's that?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWhy, I'll betcha there must be a
tmillion albacore and tuna running
tof the coast right this minute.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tOh, do you do much fishing?

As they pass through the security gate:

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tFish! Hell, Doc, I'd like to have a
tnickel for every fish I landed
tbetween Point Conception and the
tAlaska coast...

Washington and Warren continue down the hallway, passing
SEFELT, who shyly approaches and waits at a respectful
distance.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tt(to McMurphy)
tIs that so?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay
tfor just about every season since I
twas able to haul my own weight.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tMy, my... Ah, who are you?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tMcMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.

They shake hands.

<b>tttNURSE PILBOW
</b>tMister McMurphy is a new admission.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tAh, yes. Well, we must talk soon,
tMister McMurphy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYou bet, Doc.

Spivey turns to Sefelt.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tGood morning, Jim. How are you
tfeeling?

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tt(approaching and pointing
ttto his mouth)
tDoc, my gungs hurt me.

Spivey starts checking out Sefelt's mouth.

<b>tttNURSE PILBOW
</b>tThis way, Mister McMurphy.

As McMurphy follows Nurse Pilbow down the hall, Spivey's
voice trails after him.

<b>tttSPIVEY (O.S.)
</b>tHave you been taking your Dilantin,
tJim?

<b>tttSEFELT (O.S.)
</b>tUh-huh...

<b>tttSPIVEY (O.S.)
</b>tWell, we'll send you over to the

tOkay?

<b>tttSEFELT (O.S.)
</b>tOkay, Doc!

McMurphy and Nurse Pilbow reach the day room.

<b>tttMISS PILBOW
</b>tMake yourself at home, Mister
tMcMurphy...

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThank you, ma'am,

Nurse Pilbow enters the nurses' station, closing the door
behind her. Next to the door is a bulletin board which, among
other bits of information, READS: 

<b>TODAY IS MONDAY SEPTEMBER 30, 1963. THE NEXT MEAL IS LUNCH.
</b><b>THE NEXT HOLIDAY IS HALLOWEEN.
</b>
Another notice READS: 

<b>SIGN UP NOW! BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT STAFF VS PATIENTS.
</b>Washington, Warren, Miller

There are no other names listed. Sefelt passes by.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (CONT'D)
</b>tHi.

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tHi.

Sefelt crosses into the day room where he joins Fredrickson,
who is putting a jigsaw puzzle together.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
</b>
as McMurphy drifts into the room and looks around. The room
is as it was. The MUSIC ENDS. There is a CLICK. McMurphy's
attention is drawn to the nurses' station.

McMURPHY'S POV OF NURSES' STATION

where Miss Pilbow is SEEN through a large plate glass window,
busy typing a nameplate for McMurphy.

Big Nurse, her back to McMurphy, is turning over a stack of
records. She presses the phonograph button. A record falls on
the turntable and MUSIC BEGINS as she turns and sees
McMurphy.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
McMurphy smiles and tips his hat to Big Nurse. 

Big Nurse smiles back and takes her seat. 

McMurphy turns and drifts into the day room. 

Big Nurse looks up and studies him. 

McMurphy catches the eye of a PATIENT, sitting by himself.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHow ya doin', buddy?

<b>tttPATIENT
</b>tPoorly, thank you.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tOh, yeah? What's ailing ya?

<b>tttPATIENT
</b>tI got the fever.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWell, that's too bad...

Taber, pencil and paper in hand, crosses to McMurphy and taps
him on the shoulder.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (CONT'D)
</b>tYeah, buddy?

<b>tttTABER
</b>tAre you a doctor?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tNo, 'fraid not...

Taber walks away.

Martini tugs at McMurphy's sleeve.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (CONT'D)
</b>tYeah, buddy?

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tCan you borrow me a dime?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tSorry, buddy, I'm clean outta

Scanlon moves in.

<b>tttSCANLON
</b>tGot a cigarette?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tSure...

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tMe too! Me too!

As McMurphy hands out his cigarettes Bromden drifts by, mop
in hand.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHey, how's it look up there, big
tboy?

<b>tttSCANLON
</b>tHe can't hear you. He's just a deaf

<b>tttHARDING (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>tMartini!

</b>tt(to Martini)
tYour buddy is callin' ya.

Martini crosses back to the card game as Taber returns.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWhat's troubling ya, buddy?

<b>tttTABER
</b>tI want you to write me a letter to
tmy brother for a hundred dollars to

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHow do ya know that?

<b>tttTABER (CONT'D)
</b>tBecause I quit breathing.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYou're breathin' right now.

Taber walks away.

McMurphy watches him go.

Nearby, an OLD VEGETABLE squeaks.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(crossing to him)
tWhat's that, Pop?

The old man squeaks again.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(leaning in close)
tCan't hear ya, old-timer.

<b>tttOLD VEGETABLE
</b>tAin't this a pisser?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHell, compared to where I just come

McMurphy crosses to the card game and stands watching the
game.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWhatcha boys playin'?

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tH-H-Hearts.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tShoot! No wonder you don't care

tWhat for?

<b>tttHARDING

<b>tttCHESWICK
</b>tt(to McMurphy)
tHe's a busy man!

A beat; then:

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tI can wait...

McMurphy picks up a chair and sits down right next to Harding
and looks at him. Another beat; then:

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tt(to McMurphy)
tWhat are you doing?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tI'm seeing what a busy man does.

Harding, very nervous at McMurphy's proximity, turns back to
the game.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tYour turn, Martini!

Martini is lost in the clouds.

<b>tttHARDING (CONT'D)
</b>tMartini, throw a card!

Martini throws a diamond.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tt(slamming his cards)
tWell, if you gentlemen will excuse

Harding gets up and crosses to the hallway, gathering his
pride as he goes.

McMurphy slides into Harding's seat and rakes all the cards
in.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYessir, that's why I came to this
testablishment for, to bring you
tbirds fun and entertainment 'round
tthe gamin' table...

McMurphy fans the deck out and lays it on the table.
Everyone's eyes pop as he scoops the cards up in one movement
-- he's a card shark, a magician -- leaving the Acutes with
their mouths hanging open.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tEasy now, don't smudge 'em, we got

<b>tttBIG NURSE (O.S.)

McMurphy walks with her toward the men's dorm.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tMy name is Miss Ratched. I'm the
thead nurse here. You've already met
tMiss Pilbow and Aides Washington
tand Warren.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYes, ma'am.

Big Nurse and McMurphy stop at the security gate to the men's
dorm where Miller opens the gate.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tMister Miller, this is Mister
tMcMurphy, who'll be staying with

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tWe do appreciate the way you have
ttaken it upon yourself to meet the
tother patients.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThank you, ma'am...

Big Nurse stops at an empty bed where Warren is turning the
mattress down.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tThis is your bed. You may leave
tyour things in that cabinet.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYes, ma'am...

</b>tPlease use your time to familiarize

<b>tttBIG NURSE 
</b>tAll in good time, Mister McMurphy.
tAll in good time.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYes, ma'am.

<b>tttBIG NURSE 
</b>tGood. Now if you'll just go along
twith Mister Washington, he'll see
tthat you're properly oriented.

McMurphy doesn't move.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tIs there anything else?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tJust that I'm glad to be here, Miss
tRatched. I really am.

<b>tttBIG NURSE 
</b>tGood. I'm sure we'll be friends.

They smile, sizing up each other.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYeah, you ain't half so bad looking
tfor a head nurse.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tYes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy.
tGo along.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYes, ma'am.
tt(to Washington)

They cross out of the men's dorm.

Big Nurse watches them go.

<b>tttSPIVEY (V.O.)

<b>INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Doctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, on which are several
glass-framed photos of Spivey's family, plus a nameplate:
JOHN M. SPIVEY, M.D., and McMurphy's papers.

McMurphy, freshly showered and wearing hospital-issue
clothes, sits facing him.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHell, Doc, I've been everything
tfrom a hoopla man with a two-bit
tcarny show to a top mechanic and

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tPoker!

<b>tttSPIVEY

<b>tttSPIVEY (CONT'D)
</b>tIn what way?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThey say I'm a habitual hassler.
tLike I fight some. Sheeut. They
tdidn't mind so much when I was a

tThat's a hardworkin' feller blowing

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tI see...

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tTo tell the truth, ever since I
tfound my natural callin' I done

tcould write a brochure...

<b>tttSPIVEY 
</b>tYes... Ah, do you know why you're

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWell, ya know, Doc...
tt(indicating his papers)
tDoesn't it say so there?

<b>tttSPIVEY 
</b>tt(looking over papers)
tWell, according to the Warden at
tPendleton, you were a disturbing
tinfluence on others. 'It appears
tthat there is a potential in him
tfor instigating a revolt among the
tother inmates.'
tt(looking up at McMurphy)
tWhat do you think of that report?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tI don't, Doc...

<b>tttSPIVEY 
</b>tt(goes back to papers)
tArrested on an assault charge five

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThat's correct, Doc ...

tThe doctor at the prison states:
t'Don't overlook the possibility

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tAh, it seems you have no other

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
</b>
CAMERA is on Big Nurse as she stands, in front of a chair,
doing a deep breathing exercise.

The patients and staff, standing in front of chairs arranged
in a circle, follow suit as best they can. After a couple of
exercises Big Nurse sits. The others do the same except
Bancini, who remains standing, wagging his head back and
forth.

<b>tttBANCINI
</b>tI'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm
tawful tired...

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tt(busy with her papers)
tSomebody please see to Mister
tBancini, so we can start the
tmeeting.

Billy does... gently laying a hand on Bancini.

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tT-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P
tPete...

<b>tttBANCINI
</b>tAwful tired...

Billy gently eases Bancini into his chair and sits beside
him, patting his skinny knee.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tAt the close of Friday's meeting,
twe were discussing Mister Harding's
tproblem, concerning his wife...
tt(reading from logbook)
tMister Harding stated that his wife
tmade him uneasy because she drew
tstares from men on the street. Is
tthat correct, Mister Harding?

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tYes, that's perfectly correct.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tt(reading)
tHe also thinks he may have given
ther reason to seek sexual attention
telsewhere, but he didn't say how.
tHe has been heard to say to his
twife, 'I hate you, I don't ever
twant to see you again. You've
tbetrayed me.'
tt(she closes book)
tSo. Does anyone care to touch upon
tthis further?

Big Nurse waits. A long beat.

Harding sits, chewing his nails, tensely waiting, almost
wanting someone to begin.

The patients shift uncomfortably, looking in all directions.

McMurphy looks around to see what will follow, when he sees
Ellis, nailed to the wall; his pants leg darkens and a puddle
of piss forms at his feet. McMurphy looks to see if Big Nurse
or the Aides have noticed.

If they have, no one pays any attention.

McMurphy fidgets in his seat, then gets up, crosses to Ellis,
unhooks him from the wall, and moves him over a few feet.

The other patients are aghast at this move, look at each
other quizzically.

Big Nurse merely watches.

McMurphy crosses back to his chair and sits.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tMister McMurphy, this ward is a
tdemocratic community run by the
tpatients and their votes, so you
tshould feel at ease in your new
tsurroundings to the extent you can
tfreely discuss emotional problems
tin front of the patients and staff.
tHowever, the cardinal rule, and I
tmust emphasize this: Everyone keeps
ttheir seat during the meeting!

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYeah, well, it just pains me
tsomethin' awful to see a full
tgrowed man sloshing around in his
town water...

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tYes... We were discussing Mister
tHarding's problem with his wife.
tNow, who will start?
tt(no response)
tBilly.

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tM-m-m-ma'am?

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tWould you like to start?

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tN-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tMister Sefelt?

Sefelt shrugs and sinks into his seat.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tMister Fredrickson?

Fredrickson passes.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tMister Taber?

Taber passes.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tMister Martini?

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tNo!

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tMister Scanlon?

Scanlon looks at the floor.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tMister Cheswick?

Cheswick wags his head 'no.'

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tAm I to take it that there isn't a
tman among you who has an opinion
tconcerning this matter?
tt(no response; she focuses
ttin on Harding)
tMister Harding, you've stated on
tmore than one occasion that you
tsuspected your wife of seeing other
tmen.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tYes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tBut you have no proof.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tNo, Miss Ratched...

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tAnd yet you suspect her.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tYes, that is correct.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tWhy?

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tI can only speculate as to the
treasons why.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tHave you ever speculated, Mister
tHarding, that you are impatient
twith your wife because she does not
tmeet your mental requirements?

One of the Chronics laughs like a child.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tMiss Ratched. Given all the
tconditions of that sublime
trelationship, coupled with the
tsubsequent annihilation of all that
tI held to be sacred, mentally,
tphysically and emotionally, the
tonly thing that I can speculate on,
tat this late date, is how I will
tjustify the very existence of my
tlife, with or without my dear wife.

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tWhat's he talkin' about?

<b>tttTABER
</b>tYeah, Harding, why don't you
tknockoff the bullshit and get to
tthe point.

Several Acutes chime in, "Yeah, get to the point," AD LIB.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tThe point is, I will carry on until
tI fully understand what the
tfunction of that relationship is
tregardless of form or content.

Several hands go up.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tYes, Billy?

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tI-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how
tanyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man
twho t-t-t-talks the way he does.

<b>tttTABER
</b>tYeah, Harding, you're so fuckin'
tdumb I can't believe it.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tThat's a matter of opinion.

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tYeah, Harding, where do you breathe
tanyway?

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tThrough the ass.

Sefelt and Fredrickson snicker into their hands. A few of the
others laugh.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tt(smarting)
tIs that your sense of humor or are
tyou trying to say something?

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tt(innocence itself)
tNow what would I be trying to say?

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tI don't know. I don't know, but it
tmakes me feel very peculiar when
tyou throw in something like that.

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tPeculiar?

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tWhy?

<b>tttTABER
</b>tYeah, why?

<b>tttSCANLON
</b>tYeah, tell us why.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tI hesitate to go on.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tNo secrets, Mister Harding. Let's
tget it all out in the open...

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tI mean, the other day you made an
tallusion to my wife and the
tpossible sexual problems we might
tbe having. I know that to be the
tcase, but the way in which you
tbroached it, if that's your idea of
tteaching me something...

<b>tttHARDING (CONT'D)
</b>tt(his voice rising as he
ttgoes on)
t... or making me aware of a
tcondition in my life, then I say,
tcategorically speaking, the hell
twith you, Taber!
tI don't have to justify the
tcondition of my life to you or any
tof you. No matter what I will carry
ton until I fully understand what
tthat function is regardless of the
tform or content. Regardless of the
tfact we must try to understand the
tfunction of our capacity to obtain,
tto personify the condition, the
tcondition of our existence, our
texistence...

<b>tttTABER
</b>tYou know what, Harding? I think
tyou're some kind of morbid asshole
tor something. You've been talking
tabout your wife evere since I can
tremember. You know, she's on your

tand on and when are you going to
twise up and turn her loose!

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tYeah, wise up, Harding.

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tYeah, turn her loose!

<b>tttACUTES

tYeah, who do you think you are

<b>tttBANCINI
</b>tt(in a strong angry voice)
tI'm tired!

Everyone hushes.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tSomebody see to Mister Bancini.

Two or three Acutes get up and try to soothe Bancini, but he
isn't to be hushed.

<b>tttBANCINI
</b>tTired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired...

Big Nurse nods to Washington, who goes to Pete, and gives his
arm a jerk toward the door. Bancini is unmovable.

Big Nurse signals Nurse Pilbow, who heads for the nurses'
station.

Washington senses danger, lets go of Pete's arm, backs away.

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tYou a good boy, Mistah Bancini...

Nurse Pilbow returns, hypodermic needle in hand.

Pete turns to his fellow inmates.

<b>tttBANCINI
</b>tYou see... it's a lotta baloney...
tIt's all a lotta baloney...

<b>tttNURSE PILBOW
</b>tYes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if
tyou'll just be calm...

<b>tttBANCINI
</b>tThat's all it is, just a lotta
tbaloney. Ya see, I can't help it,
tcan't...

<b>tttNURSE PILBOW
</b>tt(working her way around
ttBancini)
tYes, I know, I know...

She gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back.

<b>tttBANCINI
</b>t... don't ya see. I was born dead.
tNot you. You wasn't born dead.
tAhhh, it's been so hard...
tt(starts going over,
ttslowly; sighing and
ttcrying)
tTired... I'm tired... aw-ful
ttired...

McMurphy looks around at the others.

Each patient is locked in his own world -- oblivious to
Bancini's state.

<b>EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
</b>
WIDE SHOT of entire court, surrounded by a high fence topped
off with barbed wire, as Washington and Warren escort the
Acutes -- including Bromden, Ellis, a lobotomy case and
several other Chronics -- through the gate onto the court,
which is run down, with cracks in its surface and leaves
scattered everywhere.

Martini, who is carrying the ball, runs ahead, followed by
Scanlon, where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic
circle, suddenly passes the ball to nothing.

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tt(as he throws ball)
tCatch it! Catch it!

The ball rolls to the corner.

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tMartini, there ain't nobody there,
tya dumb goon! Go get the ball!

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tNo!

Martini turns away, his feelings hurt. Washington goes after
the ball, when Martini goes running after it.

<b>tttMARTINI (CONT'D)
</b>tI get it! I get it!

But Washington gives Martini a body check and beats him to
the ball.

Martini tries to get the ball from Washington, who is quite
agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and
Warren start shooting baskets, freezing Martini and Scanlon
out.

The other patients just hang around or walk, as if in a
prison yard.

Cheswick stands in close proximity to McMurphy and Harding,
who stand watching the action. McMurphy finally offers a
cigarette to Harding, who accepts. They both light up.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWell, say, buddy, is that the usual
tpro-cedure for those Group Ther'py
tshindigs? Bunch of chickens at a
tpeckin' party?

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tA pecking party?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThat's right, buddy. And you want
tto know who pecks the first peck?

<b>tttHARDING AND CHESWICK
</b>tWho? Who?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tAh, come off it! It's that Big
tNurse, that's who...

The other Acutes have gathered around McMurphy and Harding.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tIt's as simple as that. You've been
ton our ward six hours and have
talready simplified the work of
tFreud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in
tone grand analogy: it's a pecking
tparty.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tI'm not talking about Fred Yoong or
tMaxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm
ttalkin' about is that crummy
tmeeting and what that nurse did to

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tDid to me?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tDid to you and all the rest of you

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWhat did I see 'cept a grown man

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tIt's the questions she asks.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tTell 'er to go straight to hell!

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tMiss Ratched is a competent
tpsychiatric nurse, not some, some
tkind of monster pecking out our
teyes!

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(as calm as blue waters)
tShe ain't peckin' at your eyes,
tbuddy.

McMurphy grabs Harding by his balls and Harding goes up on
his toes.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tShe's peckin' at your balls, buddy,
tat your ever-lovin' balls.

Harding is doubled over.

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tThat kind of behavior will get you
ta P.A. rating, my friend.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tP.A. What the hell is that?

<b>tttSEFELT 
</b>tPotential assaultive.

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tWhich gets you shipped up to
tDisturbed for a nice little zap
tjob.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHuh?

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tElectro-Shock Therapy, my friend.
tFive cents' worth of electricity
tand you are out of everybody's
thair.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tTell 'er to go to hell anyway!

<b>tttHARDING (CONT'D)
</b>tAnd if you persist in your ways,
tthey can always ship you over to
tMedical Surgery.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWhat for?

<b>tttHARDING (CONT'D)
</b>tLobotomy!

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tLobotomy?

<b>tttHARDING (CONT'D)

McMurphy looks.

<b>SHOT OF A LOBOTOMY CASE
</b>
A vegetable, complete with two half-dollar scars in his
forehead.

McMURPHY

As he absorbs this bit of information the basketball rolls to
his feet and he picks it up.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Harding)
tIs that your sense of humor or are
tyou tryin' to say somethin'?

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tNow, what would I be trying to say?

Martini and Scanlon rush over and try to get the ball.

<b>tttSCANLON
</b>tGimme the ball!

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tNo. Me! Me!

<b>tttWASHINGTON (O.S.)
</b>tPass the ball, McMurphy.

McMurphy crosses to the court, bouncing the ball as he goes.
When he reaches the court he holds the ball out to
Washington, who reaches for it, but McMurphy snaps it back
over his shoulder to Martini.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(turning to Martini)
tPass it to me, Martini.

Martini holds back.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tC'mon, I'll give it back!

Martini passes to McMurphy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tAtta boy, Martini.

He passes it back to Martini, who laughs and passes it back
to McMurphy, who passes it to Scanlon, who passes to
McMurphy, who passes to Billy, etc. Bromden just stands
watching.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(encouraging them)
tBack and forth, that's it. Shoot,
tman, we'll be takin' on the New
tYork Knicks before we're through...

McMurphy looks to see Big Nurse looking out a window at them.
He catches her eye. She turns away.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (V.O)
</b>tHey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on,
tI'm waitin' on you suckers, you hit

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The MUSIC is PLAYING. The TV is on the six o'clock news as
McMurphy, cards in hand, is dealing blackjack to Cheswick,
Harding, Sefelt, Billy and Martini. Fredrickson and Scanlon
are looking on as Bromden eases up to the game. Cheswick is
at the nurses' station talking to Big Nurse.

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tHit me!

<b>tttMCMURPHY

tthe hill and dropped his load.

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tBoogered!

McMurphy rakes in Sefelt's cigarettes, adding them to a pile
of loose cigarettes, packs of cigarettes, several cartons of
cigarettes.

As Cheswick sits down, depressed:

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>t'Kay, place your bets.

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tt(holding up a cigarette)
tWhat's this?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThat's a dime, Martini.

Martini breaks a cigarette in half.

</b>tThat okay. I'll take your marker.
tHow many ya want?

<b>tttCHESWICK (CONT'D)
</b>tLend me twenty.

McMurphy counts out twenty cigarettes, marks it down on a
piece of paper, and passes the cigarettes to Cheswick, who
bets all twenty.

The Sports have come on TV and McMurphy's attention is
divided.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(checking the board)
t'Kay, all bets are down, let's
twheel 'em an' deal 'em.

He deals the cards out, the first one face down, then the

who stands there waiting to dispense orange juice.

holding the cross in front of her.

him.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
as McMurphy goes around to the front of the nurses' station
and queues up behind the other Acutes who are getting their
medication. McMurphy reaches the window, takes the cup, but
doesn't take his pills.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Big Nurse)
tPardon me, ma'am, can I ask you
tsomethin'?

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tt(politely)
tYes, Mister McMurphy?

<b>tttBIG NURSE

tMister McMurphy, there are old men
there who couldn't hear the music at

McMurphy jerks his hand away.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tSorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that...

McMurphy breathes on the glass and wipes it clean with his
sleeve.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tSorry to have bothered you.

<b>tttBIG NURSE 
</b>tNot at all, Mister McMurphy...

McMurphy turns to walk away.

tWhat's the horse pill for, honey?

<b>tttNURSE PILBOW
</b>tIt's just medication, Mister

tgoes...

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tLook, miss, I don't like swallowing

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tNo, that's okay, ma'am. Down it
tgoes.

McMurphy makes a big show of popping the pill in his mouth,
holding his paper cup upside down, for all to see, then
moving on to Washington, who fills it with orange juice.

McMurphy gulps it down, not without some difficulty, then he
smiles at all the concerned faces and crosses the room to the
card table, where he sits to see the Acutes looking at him.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tWhy didn't you tell her to go to
thell, lover boy?

<b>tttTABER
</b>tYeah, whattsa matter, Mack, she too

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tI don't see you scoring any points,

<b>INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT
</b>
The patients are asleep except for Bromden, who stands by the
window looking out.

McMurphy is asleep in the bed next to his. A beat when
TURKLE, a fifty-year-old Negro night attendant, slightly
drunk, lays a gentle hand on Bromden's shoulder.

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tLe's get back to bed, Mistah
tBromden...

Bromden allows himself to be led back to bed. Turkle fumbles
around for the security belt, finds it, straps Bromden
loosely in bed, then goes off clucking to himself.

Bromden reaches under his bed and plucks a stale piece of gum
from under the bed frame. He starts chewing it when he sees
McMurphy looking at him.

Bromden goes right on chewing and looking McMurphy right in
the eye.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(whispering)
tChief? I wanna ask ya somethin'.
tt(sings)
tOh, does the spearmint lose its
tflavor on the bedpost overnight?
tWhen you chew it in the morning,
twill it be too hard to bite? This
tquestion's got me goin', won't
tsomebody set me right; does the
tspearmint lose its flavor on the
tbedpost overnight?

McMurphy holds the last note, reaches over and rustles
through his nightstand.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHere ya go, Chief...

A small object lands on Bromden's bed. It is a fresh package
of gum. Bromden picks it up. Examines it. Unwraps it.
Deposits his old piece of gum under the bed frame, then
inserts the fresh gum in his mouth and starts chewing.

as McMurphy enters to see Warren take a firm grip on

distorted face as the BUZZING SOUND of the ELECTRIC RAZOR

<b>INT. MESS HALL - DAY
</b>
We SEE the attendants spooning food into the sucking pink
mouths of the vegetables, a shade too fast for swallowing.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (O.S.)
</b>tWhat's wrong with you guys?

We SEE McMurphy seated with the Acutes, shoveling food down
his guillet. The others are barely touching their food.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWhy, if I'd have known how soft
tthis place was gonna be, I'd have

tAll this place lacks is a couple of

He gets up and carries his tray to the proper place, where he
notices Miller loading several other trays onto a dumbwaiter.
Miller pushes a button and the dumbwaiter goes down. McMurphy
crosses to the door to find it blocked by Washington.

</b>tStand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.

tNow, as I recall, we were making
tquite a bit of headway, last time,
twith Mister Harding's problem. So,

McMurphy's hand goes up. No one else's does.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tYes, Mister McMurphy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tRight... I've been givin' some

tbefore we get back to Harding's
tproblem.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tCertainly, Mister McMurphy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tRight!

McMurphy takes a folded sheet of paper out of his pocket,
unfolds it, studies it and begins.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>t'Kay... Item one... I've been
tthinkin' 'bout the age problem we
tgot on this ward. You know, the
tyoung an' old livin' together, an'
tI was thinkin' what a great thing
tit would be if the music was turned
tup louder. Louder so the old fellas
tcould hear better...

Doctor Spivey nods with approval.

Big Nurse doesn't.

The Acutes are bewildered.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tBut then I got to thinkin', the
tmusic is so loud already, it makes
tit difficult for the young fellas
tto hold a decent conversation...

Nods and murmurs of approval from the Acutes.

Big Nurse can only wait for McMurphy's next move.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWell, I was turnin' this dilemma
tover in my head, when I happened to
thit on that old tub room out there,
tan' I said to myself, McMurphy, I
tsaid, that place would make a great
tsecond day room. A sort of game
troom for the young fellas. Whadaya
tthink, Doc?

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tIt is worth considering... Miss
tRatched?

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tThe point is well taken, Doctor,
tbut do we have the necessary
tpersonnel to cover a second day
troom?

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tWell, since it will be largely the
tChronics who remain here, one aide
tand one nurse should easily be able
tto handle any situation that might
toccur.
tt(he turns to the patients)
tWhat do you think, men, is it
tworkable?

<b>tttCHESWICK
</b>tRight, Doc. It's workable.

Several other Acutes voice in the affirmative.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tFine!

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tGood. Good. Yes, yes, I think we
tshould give it a trial period. So!
tMay we get back to Mister Harding's

tt(she sees McMurphy's hand
ttup)
tYes, Mister McMurphy?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tI'm not finished yet.

<b>tttBIG NURSE

Only Cheswick's goes up.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tCome on', what is this crap? Who

Martini and Scanlon's hands go up.

Several Acutes look at them.

McMurphy can't believe his eyes.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)

</b>tYeah, you don't know how to get

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tPut your money where your mouth is,
tTaber.

<b>tttTABER (CONT'D)
</b>tYeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony,
tMcMurphy!

Bromden turns back to the room to see McMurphy slam his fist
down on the table; the monopoly game goes flying.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(rising and turning on the
ttothers, who back off)
tYou want me to show ya! You want me
tto show ya how!

<b>tttTABER (CONT'D)
</b>tYeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tAll right!

He looks wildly around the room, spots the machine, crosses
to it and smacks it with his hand.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWith this thing! I'm gonna put this
tthing right through the window,
tthat's how!

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tYou mean you're going to try to

<b>tttHARDING 
</b>tOkay, sucker.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYeah... Okay, stand aside, you
tguys! You're usin' up my oxygen!

The Acutes stand aside and McMurphy steps up to the machine.

He shifts his feet to get a good stance, wipes his hands on
his thighs, leans down and gets hold of the levers on each
side, and strains.

Bromden watches, in awe of McMurphy.

McMurphy turns loose, straightens up and shifts his feet for
a better position.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tGiving up?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tJust warmin' up.

He grabs the levers again. His whole body shakes with the
strain. For just a second we HEAR the cement GRIND. Then his
breath explodes and he falls back limp against the wall.
There's blood on his hands. No sound but his rasping breath.
He opens his eyes and looks around. Then pulls out a
pocketful of IOU's and tries to sort them out, but his hands
are frozen into red claws. He throws the whole bundle on the
floor and walks out. At the door, he turns back.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tBut I tried. Goddammit, I sure as
thell did that much. Didn't I?

McMurphy exits.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tTry, Billy, try...

Billy tries, but can't talk.

The other Acutes are bored, restive, waiting.

McMurphy has ants in his pants as Big Nurse speaks to Billy.

</b>tt(rubbing scars on his

tI was in luh-love with her.

twith it? This is an important event

<b>tttBIG NURSE 
</b>tEveryone in favor of changing the
tschedule raise his hand.

The first hand to come up is Cheswick's. Then McMurphy's.
Then Martini, Scanlon, Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber.

Harding doesn't vote.

Big Nurse starts counting the hands.

McMurphy, his face beaming, counts the hands.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThat's it! We made it!

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tI'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count

tYou mean you don't want their votes
tto count, Billy!

<b>tttBILLY
</b><b>tI-I-I...
</b>
<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWell, screw that noise!

McMurphy rises and, taking his chair, he crosses toward the
television set.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tSit down, Mister McMurphy!

McMurphy turns the TV on, flips the channel, then sits and
waits for a picture.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tI want you to turn the television
toff and return to your place!

A picture swirls onto the TV screen. The ballgame is in
progress (documentary footage to be used).

Martini rushes over and joins McMurphy. Scanlon follows hot
on his heels as --

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHoo-wee! Man, all I need me now is
ta can of beer and a red-hot.

Cheswick gets up and starts across when --

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tSit down, Mister Cheswick.

Cheswick stops and stands there, helpless to move.

<b>tttCHESWICK
</b>tMack...

McMurphy is deep into the game.

<b>INSERT - TV SCREEN
</b>
On the screen a great play is taking place, and at the
breathtaking moment the TV picture swirls into a little eye
of light -- then nothing.

<b>BACK TO SCENE

The Acutes are left with their mouths hanging open.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (V.O.)
</b>tt(over loudspeaker)
tI want you men to return to your

McMurphy continues looking at the blank TV screen as the
Acutes look from McMurphy to Big Nurse, not knowing what to
do next when --

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(jumping up and shouting
ttat the blank TV screen)
tA hit! It's a hit! He's rounding
tfirst, heading for second. Here
tcomes the throw. He's sliding...

tt(McMurphy whistles and
ttclaps his hands)
tHoo-wee! Whatta game! Whatta game!
tCome on, Koufax! Strike 'em out!

The Acutes are stunned at McMurphy's outburst.

tdeliberately violating the
trules!...

<b>tttMCMURPHY

Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber get up and cross toward
the TV. Harding is the only one who doesn't join them.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (V.O.)
</b>tt(over loudspeaker)
tYou men remain seated!

tHe's going back! Back! His back is

The Acutes are shouting, cheering, stomping and dancing in
each other's arms.

<b>tttBIG NURSE'S VOICE
</b>tt(over loudspeaker)
tYou men stop this! Mister
tWashington! Miller! Warren!

Big Nurse's last words overload the intercom and the system
peaks out. Big Nurse's mouth continues to work in frantic
circles as Washington, Miller and Warren rush to quell the
uproar.

<b>INT. SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Doctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, looking over
McMurphy's papers.

McMurphy sits facing him.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tHow are you feeling?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tJust fine, Doc... In fact, I think

</b>tYes, well, Miss Ratched feels that
tyou're a disturbing influence on
tthe other patients.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tShoot, Doc, the only one I'm
tdisturbing is that old nurse and
ther fixed ways. That's all.

<b>tttSPIVEY 
</b>tYes, that may be so, but in making
ta careful study of your past
trecord, along with your behavior
tsince you arrived here, my feeling
tis that you are not mentally ill
tand it is going to be my
trecommendation that you be returned
tto Pendleton where they are better
tequipped to handle your case.

This is the kiss of death to McMurphy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY

twe cannot offer you the guidance

treceive at Pendleton.

<b>EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

Washington and Warren are sitting on the grass watching
Martini, Scanlon, Harding and Billy, who are positioned on
the court waiting on McMurphy who is under the board with
Bromden.

Cheswick and the other patients hang around off court as:

<b>tttMCMURPHY

tOkay, Chief. This is your spot! I
tdon't want you to move from this

McMurphy raises his hands above his head. Bromden follows
suit.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThat's good! That's a good boy,
tChief! Now jump and put it in!

McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't. McMurphy does this a couple

tHey, Chief, come back!

Cheswick goes after Bromden, catches him, and McMurphy
latches onto him.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tNow, wheel me to the basket.

Cheswick, straining under the weight of McMurphy, turns
toward the basket.

out of bed and silently cross down the aisle, past the sleep

as McMurphy crosses the day room, past the nurses' station
where Turkle is asleep.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
as McMurphy crosses down the hallway and stops at the mess
hall door. He tries the handle. The door is locked. McMurphy
looks up at the open transom, ponders it, then jumps up and
grabs the door lintel. He tries to lift himself up, but can't
make it when suddenly he is lifted up to the level of the
transom by Bromden.

McMurphy worms his way through the transom and disappears
down the other side.

CAMERA HOLDS on Bromden who waits. A long beat. There is a
strange HUMMING SOUND HEARD O.S. Another beat, then the door
opens.

McMurphy smiles at Bromden.

</b>tCharlie, ya can't ever let those

<b>tttCHESWICK
</b>tRight, Mack!

Far down the tunnel Martini and Scanlon are briefly SEEN as
they skitter across the tunnel.

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tThere they are!

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya

McMurphy starts down the tunnel. The others don't move.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(calling back)
tCome on, you guys, let's stick
ttogether.

The Acutes follow McMurphy. They run down to the intersection
and turn the corner.

No sign of Martini or Scanlon.

Somewhere a DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING CLOSED and FOOTSTEPS are
HEARD coming their way.

<b>tttTABER
</b>tSomebody's coming!

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tShhh!
tt(he listens then)
tThis way!

McMurphy hustles the men round the corner as two aides
pushing a gurney come wheeling by.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWe'll go back just as soon as we

<b>tttACUTES
</b>tt(simultaneously)
t'Kay, Mack!

The band takes off down tbe tunnel, calling out in loud
whispers, "Martini! Scanlon! Psst! Where are you?"

Down one tunnel and up another -- till they turn a corner and
see an open door.

They go to the door and peer out. Steps lead up to the
outside world.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThey must be up there!

<b>tttCHESWICK
</b>tYeah!

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tL-L-Let-'s go b-back!

Several Acutes express the same desire.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tCome on, don't crap out on me now.

<b>tttBILLY (CONT'D)
</b>tI-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tFuck Miss Ratched!

McMurphy crosses out and up the stairs.

The Acutes look at each other. A beat, then:

<b>tttMCMURPHY (O.S.)
</b>tWow! Look at this!

The Acutes don't move.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (O.S.)
</b>tHey, you guys, come on up here and

The Acutes inch their way out the door and up the steps.

<b>EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - NIGHT
</b>
as the Acutes join McMurphy to see the moon low in the sky,
silhouetting the trees and buildings, and Martini chasing

Scanlon across the wet grounds.

The Acutes cast frightened looks at each other then go after
McMurphy. Martini and Scanlon join them.

<b>tttBILLY (CONT'D)
</b>tH-H-How d-d-do we g-g-get b-back?

McMurphy has reached the bus and begins checking it out.

<b>tttTABER
</b>tYeah, take us back to the
tdumbwaiter, Mac.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tI'm not going back in there. I told
tya this was a one way trip. Now
tstand aside.

McMurphy lifts the hood to the bus and begins jumping the
wire. The Acutes stand helplessly by as the engine turns over
and catches. McMurphy closes the hood and gets on the bus to
a chorus of, "Please, Mac, take us back... Please..."
McMurphy puts the bus in gear and the bus starts moving. The
Acutes start running alongside of the bus calling out for
McMurphy to take them back.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(shouting to them)
tGet on assholes!

They leap on.

Bromden boards the bus. McMurphy lets out a war whoop as he
closes the door and starts the bus moving.

<b>tttttDISSOLVE TO:

<b>EXT. DEPOE BAY - DAWN
</b>
The dawn is just cracking the horizon as the bus pulls up
behind a corroded tin sheet building. A sign reads: 

<b>DEPOE BAY, SEAMANIS SERVICE, SPORT FISHING, BOATS FOR CHARTER
</b>
Beyond the boathouse is the dock with several fishing
trawlers and beyond that -- the open sea.

The door to the bus opens and McMurphy gets out.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(as he steps out of the
ttbus)
tThis is it!

as McMurphy walks directly to the wall, alongside the door,
lifts the edge of the siding, comes up with a key, opens the
door and enters.

A beat, then the lights go on inside the building.

<b>SHOT OF BUS
</b>
The Acutes' faces pressed against the windows, looking out.

<b>INT. SEAMAN'S BUILDING - DAWN
</b>
as McMurphy lifts a cold bottle of beer out of a Coca-Cola
cooler, opens it, takes a long pull on the bottle, then
crosses to the heater and turns it on.

Nearby, a sign reads: ALL EQUIPMENT CAN BE RENTED

On the walls are old photographs of people with their prize
catches. Fishing equipment, tackle and wet weather gear crowd
the room.

There is a counter which McMurphy walks behind and takes a
bag of potato chips off a wall rack, full of beer nuts,
hostess cupcakes, etc.

McMurphy eyes the keyboard to the fishing boats. Several keys
are there.

<b>INSERT - KEYBOARD
</b>
with the names of the fishing boats: The Lark. Mary Ann.
Noel. Annabella. The Capri.

<b>INT. BUILDING DEPOE BAY - DAWN
</b>
McMurphy studying the board as the Acutes stick their heads
in the door. They're all miserable and cold.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tCome on in an' warm up. You can put
tsome of that gear on to keep warm.
tAn' there's beer an' Coke in the
tcooler an' some food over here...

They hesitate.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tCome on, don't be shy now, you're
tamong friends.

The Acutes come in, Bromden bringing up the rear.

Martini goes for the candy. Scanlon goes for the Coke. Sefelt
and Fredrickson go for the wet weather gear and boots. The
others go to the heater. Bromden stands in the middle of the
room.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWhy don't one of you boys help ol'
tChief there get warmed up?

Billy goes to Bromden's aid as McMurphy crosses to a window
and looks out.

McMurphy turns and looks out the window. A long beat.

<b>tttCHESWICK
</b>tWhen do you think we'll be going
tback, Mack?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(looking out the window)
tCome here a minute, Cheswick. You,

The Acutes cross to the window and look out, saying, "What?
What is it? Whadaya lookin' at? I don't see a thing."

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tOh, look at the pretty boat.

<b>ACUTES' POV
</b>
Nestled against the dock is a trim fishing trawler,
beautifully framed in the bay window.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (V.O.)
</b>tYeah, did you ever see a boat like
tthat? Why, I'll bet you could go
tall the way to Hawaii in that boat!
tTahiti... the Philippines...

CAMERA HOLDS on FULL SHOT of the boat.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
A long beat, then we SEE the Acutes, wearing wet weather
gear, complete with boots and squall hats, each man carrying
soda pop, food, fishing equipment, etc., being led onto the
boat by McMurphy who carries a case of beer.

<b>EXT. FISHING BOAT - DAWN
</b>
as a white gorge of smoke and water pours from the stern and
the boat pulls away from the dock, leaving a boiling foam of
water.

<b>INT. SHIP'S BRIDGE - DAWN
</b>
The entire crew is jammed into the bridge, McMurphy behind
the wheel.

McMURPHY'S POV

as the dock and other fishing boats slip by.

<b>EXT. HARBOR JETTY - DAWN
</b>
as the boat passes out of the harbor and heads for the open
sea.

<b>tttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. BOAT DECK - DAY
</b>
The sun is up. The engine is dead. The ballgame is HEARD OVER
ship's RADIO. The men are scattered over the boat. Taber and
McMurphy, beer in hand, are sunning themselves, listening to
the ballgame. On the stern Martini and Scanlon are trying to
rig up a pole. Fredrickson gives them a hand. Billy has a
line out. So does Bromden and Sefelt who is seated nearby,
fishing the ocean floor when he suddenly gets a bite and
looks over the side, surprised. His line goes straight down
into the depths. His glasses fall off into the water. Sefelt
sighs and slowly begins reeling his line in.

Billy gets a strike and starts fighting the fish.

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tH-H-Help!

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tEase up on the star drag, keep the
ttie up, up and work hell outta that
tfella.

Martini gets a strike and loses it. Scanlon comes up and
starts to take the pole from him.

<b>tttSCANLON
</b>tMy turn.

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tt(hanging onto the pole)
tNo.

They start a tug of war. Fredrickson tries to break it up,
when he gets a strike and his line spins out.

Billy's fish breaks into the sun in a shower of silver
scales, and he gets so excited he lets the end of the pole go
down and the line snaps.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tUp, I told you! Keep that tip up...
tup! You had you one big silver
tthere.

Fredrickson lands his salmon in a spray of scales and blood.

The fish is flopping all over the deck. Billy grabs the fish
and wrestles it down.

Bromden lands a fish when --

<b>tttSEFELT (O.S.)
</b>tOh, my God! I see something!

Everyone rushes over to Sefelt and looks down into the water.

<b>REVERSE SHOT
</b>
Deep down in the water a gigantic white form slowly rises out
of the depths, becoming solid, alive.

<b>tttSCANLON
</b>tJesus God...

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tWhat is it?

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tWe'll never get that on the boat.

The fish is now clearly SEEN.

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tt(calling)
tM-M-Mack! M-M-Mack!

McMurphy pulls himself up.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWhat is it, kid?

<b>tttBILLY 
</b>tC-C-Come here and l-look at th
tthis!

McMurphy crosses down and looks over the side.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHe's a big flounder. Could weigh
ttwo, three hundred. You got to lift
thim in with a winch.

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tDoes that mean we have to cut him
tloose?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tLike hell we will! We got the
tmuscle standing right here. All we
tneed is a couple gaffin' hooks and
tsome rope.

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tI-I-I'll get them.

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tMe, too.

<b>tttSCANLON
</b>tMe, too.

McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is sweating under the strain.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tSteady does it, Sefelt!

<b>SEFELT'S POV
</b>
The massive fish is closer to the surface.

<b>tttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
All the men are standing by as gaffing hooks and rope are
made ready. The fish is gaffed and slowly hauled out of the
water.

McMurphy and Bromden lean over, held by the others, grab the
big fish by its gills and, with a heave-ho, the fish is slid
in and flopped to the bottom of the boat. The men go
sprawling over the big fish. There's a lot of laughter,
handshakes and back-slapping going on when --

<b>tttVOICE
</b>tt(over bull horn)
tAll right! Stand to! Stand to!

The men look up.

<b>REVERSE SHOT - ACUTES' POV
</b>
Off the bow is a Coast Guard cutter, and on the deck stands
Doctor Spivey, Washington, Warren and several other aides
dressed in white.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - STATE HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
as the Acutes, sunburned and covered with dried brine and
fish scales, are escorted down the hallway by Washington,
Warren and Doctor Spivey.

It's a triumphant procession as they wheel the giant flounder
with a sheet over it on a gurney, holding up their catches
for all to see.

McMurphy is lagging a bit behind as they pass the mess hall
where workmen are busy installing a security screen over the
transom, while inside the mess hall another workman is SEEN
welding a lock on the dumbwaiter.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM

as Big Nurse steps out of the Nurses' Station.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tt(to Big Nurse)
tHere they are, Miss Ratched. Safe

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tGood. Well, boys, did you enjoy
tyourselves?

A burst of exuberance as the inmates hold up their fish.

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tt(to Sefelt)
tShow her the one you caught, Jim.

Sefelt whips the sheet off the big fish.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tMy, my...

No one can find superlatives or gestures big enough to
describe his catching of the big fish, "brought it in
himself" AD LIB.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYeah, ya should've come along with
tus, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a
tlittle sun on your cheeks and maybe
tcaught a fish or two.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tMr. McMurphy, you had no right to

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(loudly)
tYeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't
tit!

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tNo, it was irresponsible!

Big Nurse turns to the others, leaving McMurphy dangling.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tt(respectfully)
tThat's quite a catch, Jim. Whaat
tare you going to do with it?

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tt(crossing to McMurphy)
tGimme a cigarette!

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tI thought I might donate it to the
tmess hall.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(reaches in his pocket; he
tthas none)
tI don't have any.

AD LIBS: "They could use it." "Take a picture first."

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tThat's an excellent idea. Now, why
tdon't you boys place your fish on
tthe gurney and we'll see to it that
teveryone enjoys a fresh fish
tdinner.

The men toss their fish on the gurney as Martini joins the
group and starts hitting the others up for a cigarette. All
he gets for his troubles are a series of "No," "Get lost," "I
don't have any."

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tThank you, boys. Now if you'll just
tgo along with Mister Washington to
tthe showers, supper is in half an

The inmates start AD LIBBING and laughing, "We're not
hungry," as Martini sees Harding light up a cigarette and
crosses to him.

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tt(to Harding)
tGimme a cigarette!

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tNo!

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tWhy not?

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tI'm not running a charity ward...

Martini snaps the cigarette out of Harding's hand, and takes
off with Harding chasing him.

Martini dashes around the room, pulling chairs in Harding's
way, taking a drag on the cigarette whenever he can.

Harding corners Martini, but Martini tosses the cigarette
over Harding's head to Scanlon.

Scanlon takes off with Harding after him, absolutely livid.

Scanlon passes to Billy who passes to Martini. Everyone in
the room is getting wired.

Martini throws it away as Harding jumps him and nails him to
the floor.

<b>tttMARTINI
</b>tt(holding his hands up;
ttempty)
tAll gone! All gone! Don't hit!
tDon't hit!

Harding starts pounding Martini's head on the floor when
Billy and Scanlon jump Harding and start pounding him.

Fredrickson picks up the cigarette and stands there watching
the fight as he smokes the cigarette as Washington, Warren
and Miller move in and start separating the men.

McMurphy, watching the fight, sighs, then deliberately
crosses toward the Nurses' Station.

<b>INT. NURSES' STATION - MISS PILBOW'S POV - DAY
</b>
as McMurphy reaches the Nurses' Station and puts his hand
through the plate glass window, his fist stopping inches from
Miss Pilbow's startled face. Miss Pilbow's scream is added to
the SOUND OF THE SHATTERED WINDOW.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
</b>
McMurphy reaches in and picks up his carton of cigarettes.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tI'm sure sorry, ma'am. Gawd, but I
tam. That window glass was so clean
tI didn't even see it...

McMurphy turns and crosses back to the day room, opening the
carton of cigarettes as he goes.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYou guys want cigarettes! Here's
tthe goddamn cigarettes!

McMurphy starts tossing packages of cigarettes into the mass
of struggling bodies as Washington grabs McMurphy by the arm
and tries to wheel him away.

McMurphy shakes him off and throws a pack of cigarettes in
Washington's face.

Washington goes after McMurphy, grabs him, and drives him
against the wall, right next to Bromden, who watches as
McMurphy shoves Washington away, goes into a crouch and
starts circling Washington. Washington dances in and out,
chipping away at McMurphy's face until McMurphy drives his
fist square into Washington's white, starched chest, drawing
him against the wall.

McMurphy moves in for the kill.

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tWarren! Miller!

The Acutes have stopped fighting and are watching.

McMurphy tags Washington, then is grabbed from behind by
Warren, who pulls him back.

Washington moves in and goes to work on McMurphy, when
Bromden grabs Washington, from behind, in a bear hug.

Miller jumps on Bromden's back. Bromden, still holding
Washington, backs up into the wall, squashing Miller, who
screams out.

<b>EXT. HALLWAY TO DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
as McMurphy, bruised from the fight, and Bromden, handcuffed
to a special belt, wait while an aide unlocks the first of a
double set of heavy security doors.

The first door is locked, leaving McMurphy, Bromden, and the
three aides crammed in the small space between the two doors
while another aide opens the second door and McMurphy and
Bromden step through, followed by the aides.

<b>INT. DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
As the aide locks the door behind them, the other aides lead
Bromden and McMurphy toward a bench, where they unshackle
them.

<b>tttAIDE
</b>tt(pointing to a bench)
tWait over there...

The three aides go down the hall, leaving McMurphy and
Bromden who sit and look at their new surroundings. There is
a man sitting next to them.

McMURPHY'S POV

The architecture is the same as the ward we left below, but
it is the atmosphere that is different. A heaviness pervades
all. Heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other.
Others stand shifting from one foot to the other, while
others walk up and down the hallway, their locomotive powers
not unlike that of Parkinson's Disease (caused by too much
sedation).

Suddenly, one patient gets up, speaking very angrily,
shouting incoherently at no one; he crosses the hall and
enters a side room. An aide goes in after him. A long beat,
then the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him
back to his seat, talking softly to the man.

Further down the hallway, a gurney is wheeled out of the east
room with a patient lying on it, out cold; he is wheeled
further down the hall to the men's dorms, where he is left to
sleep it off.

Two aides come out of the EST room and head in McMurphy's
direction, where one of the aides motions to the patient
sitting next to McMurpby.

<b>tttAIDE (CONT'D)
</b>tt(approaching him very
ttgently)
tCome on, Joey... this isn't going
tto hurt you... good for you... make
tyou feel better...

The patient clings to the bench, terrified, weeping.

The aides peel him off the bench and escort him down the hall
to the EST room.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
As McMurphy watches the patient go, he takes out a package of
gum. Takes a stick for himself and gives Bromden one.
McMurphy turns back to his own thoughts.

<b>tttBROMDEN
</b>tThank you.

McMurphy looks up. A long beat.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tSay it again.

<b>tttBROMDEN
</b>tThank you.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tSay... God Bless America!

Bromden nods.

<b>tttNURSE ITSU (O.S.)
</b>tMister McMurphy.

McMurphy turns to see Nurse Itsu. The two aides are standing
behind her.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(recognizing a long-lost
ttfriend)
tHey, how ya doin'?

<b>tttNURSE ITSU
</b>tFine, thank you.

tHere, please take these.

<b>tttMCMURPHY

McMurphy takes the pills and downs them. Bromden takes his
pills.

<b>tttNURSE ITSU (CONT'D)

McMurphy takes off his shoes.

<b>tttNURSE ITSU (CONT'D)
</b>tPlease follow me.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(rising, thumbs up)
tYou an' me, Chief.

McMurphy, flanked by the two aides, follows Nurse Itsu to the
EST room.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Itsu)
tYou know, I never got your name.

<b>tttNURSE ITSU
</b>tt(stopping at the door)
tMiss Itsu.
tt(indicating the room)
tIn here, please.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYou comin' in to hold my hand?

<b>tttNURSE ITSU
</b>tNo...

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.

Itsu smiles at McMurphy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYeah...

McMurphy gives Bromden one last wave and goes in.

Bromden watches the door close behind McMurphy.

<b>INT. EST ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
There are four other aides in there, standing around an empty
gurney.

A DOCTOR is at the head of the gurney, a NURSE alongside of
him.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(as he enters)
tHi...

McMurphy looks around at the six aides.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tYou boys can take a cigarette break
tnow...

The Nurse smiles at him.

<b>tttDOCTOR
</b>tThat's all right, Mister McMurphy,
tjust climb on the bed and lie
tdown...

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWhatever you say, Doc...

McMurphy climbs on the bed and lies down.

The Doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes
McMurphy's pulse, while the Nurse dips her fingers into a jar
of salve.

<b>tttDOCTOR
</b>tt(to McMurphy)
tThis won't hurt you at all...

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tUh, uh...

The Nurse starts applying salve to McMurphy's temples.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tWhat's that for?

<b>tttNURSE
</b>tConductant.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(smiling up at her)
tSurely, goodness and mercy will
tfollow this, eh, honey?

<b>tttDOCTOR
</b>tt(holding a mouthpiece)
tPlease, put this in your mouth...

McMurphy takes the bit in his teeth. The Doctor moves back to
the head of the gurney and places the thongs on McMurphy's
temples.

The Doctor nods to the six aides, who move in and gently
place their hands, in a very professional manner, on
McMurphy's knees, hips and shoulders. Once set, the Doctor
turns to his controls.

SHOT OF McMURPHY

as he looks around, not nearly as scared as he is mystified
by the whole process, when suddenly, without warning,
McMurphy is hit by the shock. His face is a contorted mask of
surprise and pain. His whole body caught in a sudden spasm. A
moment of rigidity, then McMurphy passes out and his body
relaxes. Another moment, then a series of violent body spasms
begin flowing down his body. Now the aides' function is very
clear, as they press down, holding McMurphy firmly to the
gurney, until the last spasm subsides.

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tIt's the Dilantin that makes my
tgums soft!

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tNow, Jim, you must be honest with
tyourself.

At the end of the hall, the door opens and McMurphy and
Bromden enter the visitors' room, accompanied by Washington
and Warren. They cross to the security gate, open it and pass
into the hallway.

Washington and Warren disappear into a room, leaving McMurphy
and Bromden, who walk slowly towards the day room.

The Group Meeting continues over as Fredrickson raises his
hand.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tYes, Mister Fredrickson?

</b>tI wanna know why the dorm has to be

He sits.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tSo what? Is it a mortal sin? I

tlate on weekends...

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tWith few exceptions, time spent in

ttherapeutic, while every minute
tspent brooding alone only increases
tseparation.

<b>tttCHESWICK
</b>tt(jumping up as he sees
ttMcMurphy)
tMack!

Everyone looks at McMurphy and Bromden.

Bromden is as he always was, as McMurphy slowly drags himself
into the day room. He looks like a zombie as he takes the
room in. Then, suddenly, he slaps his thigh.
tMcMURPHY
tHey, hey, you ding-a-lings, you
tcreeps, you goons...

He enters the room doing a jig. The Acutes' faces light up.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tI got ten thousand watts and hot to
ttrot. First woman takes me on is
tgonna light up like a pinball
tmachine an' pay off in silver
tdollars...

McMurphy does a full circle of the room, greeting the
Chronics. But it's an effort for him. His voice is slower,
his footwork slightly out of sync.

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tH-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tJust fine, Billy boy, just fine.
tFull of piss an' vinegar! They

</b>tMa'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy

</b>tYeah, well, let me tell ya

A great sadness suddenly sweeps over McMurphy's face and he
breaks off.

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tWh-wh-what p-plan, M-Mack!

No response from McMurphy.

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tWhat's your plan, Mack?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(coming out of it)
tPlan?... Oh, yeah, the plan...
tYeah...

McMurphy gets up and crosses to the window, where he joins
Bromden who is looking out the window.

REACTION SHOT of the others as they look at McMurphy and each
other with quizzical looks.

<b>INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY
</b>
On the court both teams are lined up taking photographs for
the local newspaper. The bulb pops a few times.

<b>tttPHOTOGRAPHER
</b>tt(wrapping it up)
tThank you, boys.

The line breaks up. McMurphy crosses to Big Nurse, who sits
in the front row.

It's the big Saturday game between the Acutes and Aides, as
spectators enter the gymnasium already half-filled with male
and female patients, staff members and visitors.

Doctor Spivey stands nearby at the timers' table, basketball
in hand, whistle around his neck, talking to the timer.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tMiss Ratched, would you please save
ta space for my aunt? She's comin'
tdown from Portland.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tCertainly, Mister McMurphy, with

O.S. the WHISTLE BLOWS.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tGotta go now, ma'am...

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tYes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThank you, ma'am.

McMurphy crosses onto the court. Big Nurse watches him go.

<b>BASKETBALL COURT
</b>
Doctor Spivey is at half-court, basketball in hand as the
players take up their positions: Washington faces McMurphy
for the jump at center. Harding and Billy are playing guard
with Warren and Miller on them. Martini and Scanlon are in
the forward position, with the two white Aides covering them.
The other Acutes sit on the bench as substitutes.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Washington)
tHey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tShit, man, tha' ain't even worth

tYou're a witness, Doc!

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tMe? I didn't hear a thing! Let's
tplay ball!

Spivey checks the court, then blows the whistle as he tosses
the ball into the air.

Washington taps the ball to Warren, who passes to Miller, who
hands off to Washington, who goes up for a layup. Two points.
The Acutes haven't even moved from their spots. The
scoreboard reads: AIDES 2 PATIENTS 0.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(taking the ball out)
tCome on, wake up, you ding-a-lings.
tThe game is on.

The Acutes snap to and McMurphy passes the ball into Harding,
who fiercely dribbles down court, McMurphy running alongside
him.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tPass the ball, Harding...
tt(no pass)
tDon't hang onto it...
tt(no response)
tPass it, goddammit!

Harding dribbles into the corner and finds himself bottled in
by two Aides.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tHarding, here, over here!

The ball is snagged from Harding's hands by an Aide, who
passes it down court to another Aide, who turns and makes
another basket.

Scoreboard: AIDES 4 PATIENTS 0

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Harding)
tYa deaf! I said pass the ball!

<b>tttHARDING

the ball into Billy.

tGimme tha' ball!

Billy panics and hands the ball to Washington, who turns
around and makes another basket. Score: AIDES 6 PATIENTS 0.

McMurphy and Harding run down court, McMurphy taking the ball
away from Martini, who would like to bring it in.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Washington)
tWhat kind of crap is that???

<b>tttWASHINGTON (CONT'D)
</b>tJus' playin' the game, sucker...

Washington chuckles and trots on down court.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Martini)
tGet down there where ya belong,
tMartini. You, too, Scanlon.
tt(tosses ball to Harding)
tYou take it out, Harding!

Harding takes the ball and passes it in to McMurphy, who
turns and dribbles down court exactly like Harding did.

ttMcMurphy)

tt(no response)
tPass it! Pass it! I'm open,

McMurphy stops dead in his tracks and flings the ball at
Harding. The ball bounces off Harding's head and goes out of
bounds. The WHISTLE BLOWS. Harding spins a few times.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (O.S.)
</b>tHarding, get back here!

Harding turns to see the other team go by. They score another
basket. Score: AIDES 8 PATIENTS 0.

Billy takes the ball and passes into McMurphy, who turns to
see CANDY enter the gym, with her friend, ROSE.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(calling out)
tCandy. Candy, over here.
tt(to Doctor Spivey)
tHey, Doc, time out.

<b>tttSPIVEY
</b>tt(blowing his whistle)
tTime out!

McMurphy tosses the ball to Spivey, then crosses the court to
Candy and Rose, who have had a couple of drinks on the way
down.

Candy pokes her ass at McMurphy. He gives it a squeeze. O.S.
a WHISTLE BLOWS.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tCome on, girls, we're holding up
tthe game!

McMurphy leads the two ladies across the court.

The entire gymnasium is riveted on the three of them. As they
reach Big Nurse:

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tMiss Ratched, this is my Aunt Candy
tand her friend Rose...

Greetings are exchanged.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tMiss Ratched was kind enough to
tsave you ladies a seat...

The two ladies wedge themselves in next to Big Nurse. O.S.
the WHISTLE BLOWS.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tTalk to ya at half time!

McMurphy turns and crosses onto the court.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(holding the ball)
tOkay, Martini. That's okay. Now you
twatch me.

McMurphy dribbles the ball down the sideline. Stops.

Goes into his routine of ball tricks: faking one way, then
the other, over his head, under his legs, finally ending on a
pass behind his back which goes straight into Washington's
hands. Washington dribbles down court for an easy layup.

onto the court and under the Acutes' basket, where he
maneuvers him into the proper position. Then McMurphy raises
his hands above his head and Bromden follows suit.

bench is Billy, Big Nurse, Candy and Rose.

Spivey blows the whistle.

Under the Aides' basket, Harding passes the ball into
McMurphy, who dribbles to half court, takes his mark, and
lobs the ball over the outstretched arms of the Aides right
into Bromden's waiting hands. Bromden turns and slams the
ball into the basket.

The crowd goes bananas. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 2

Bromden walks in majestic dignity the full length of the
court and takes up his position under the Aides' basket,
while McMurphy and his teammates have been putting tremendous
pressure on the Aides, not allowing them to pass the ball in.

As soon as McMurphy sees that Bromden is firmly set, hands
held up, under the Aides' basket, McMurphy turns and runs
down court, followed by the other Acutes, where they take up
their defensive position.

Washington and the Aides easily bring the ball down court,
work themselves into position, and take a shot at the basket,
which Bromden swats aside.

Each Aide gets a shot at the basket, and each time Bromden
swats it aside; sending the last swat into McMurphy's waiting
hands.

On the court, McMurphy dribbles down to half court where he
is stopped by Washington and Warren, who put the squeeze on
him. McMurphy turns and gives them his ass to contend with,
then manages to throw the ball under his legs and
Washington's legs. The ball rolls to Martini, who scoops it
up and throwing it wildly away, the ball ricochets off the
backboard and goes in for two points.

The crowd goes bananas. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 6

Bromden starts striding down court when the Aides make a fast
break past him, but miss their shot.

McMurphy retrieves the ball as Bromden, not more than several
feet from his own basket, does an about-face and returns to
his basket where he turns to see McMurphy lob the ball full
court to Bromden, who catches the ball on one bounce, turns
and slams the ball in for another basket.

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tShhh...

Candy passes a heavy bag of bottles in. Then McMurphy and
Turkle help her in. Her dress is above her thighs, her ass
visible as she swings over the windowsill and into McMurphy's
arms.

<b>tttCANDY
</b>tWhew! Made it!

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(embracing Candy)
tMan, you look good 'nough to eat!

<b>tttCANDY
</b>tYeah, well you look like hell
twarmed over...

<b>tttROSE (O.S.)
</b>tHey, pssst! Whadda 'bout me?

Turkle turns to help Rose in, but she's not as easy to
handle, being a good deal heavier and twice as plastered as
Candy.

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tHey, Mac! Gimme a hand, will ya!

McMurphy disengages himself from Candy and lends Turkle a
hand. Rose is finally hauled into the room.

<b>tttROSE
</b>tt(giggling; loud)
tWhew! Hiya, boys!

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tShhh... let's move it away from the
twindow...

The group shifts a few feet as Turkle closes the window and
locks the screen. McMurphy turns back to Candy.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(arms open)
tCome here, sugar...

Candy moves into McMurphy's arms as Rose, straightening her
dress, turns to see Bromden looming. Rose SCREAMS.

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tWhat happened?

<b>tttROSE
</b>tt(backing into Turkle)
tWhat's that?

<b>tttTURKLE

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tThey're sleeping, Miss. They're

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tShhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...

Rose turns to McMurphy who has opened a bottle of booze and
is taking a long pull.

<b>tttROSE
</b>tt(to McMurphy)
tWho is he?

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(passing the bottle to
ttTurkle)
tHe's in charge.

<b>tttROSE

<b>tttTURKLE

tNot exactly, Miss. Not exactly.

<b>tttROSE
</b>tt(drinking and passing the

tYeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'.
tI'll tell ya somethin'. I had this

tYa know him, Mac. Ya remember,

tNow, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me!
tIs he crazy?

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tWell, Miss... I would say... I

<b>tttROSE

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tOh, I see. He was a very sick man.
tVery sick.

<b>tttROSE
</b>tThat's what I told his mother. And

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tI don't know anything about that,

</b>tYou ol' fucker!

<b>tttTURKLE

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tSure, she understands what you

McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE

as the two of them cross out of the day room toward the
hallway, Turkle suddenly turns and hurries back to McMurphy,
takes the bottle of booze and hurries off clucking to
himself.

BACK TO McMURPHY and CANDY.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>t'Kay, lets get under way.

McMurphy crosses to package of booze, selects another bottle,
unscrews the top and takes a long pull, then hands the bottle
to Bromden.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tDown the ol' hatch, Chief.

Bromden takes a long pull on the bottle, gags and passes the
bottle to McMurphy who crosses to the nurses' station and
peeks around the corner.

McMURPHY

as he peeks around the corner.

McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE

far down the hallway, as Turkle shows Rose one room, then
another, and then the seclusion room, into which Turkle
playfully lures Rose, who playfully resists, but finally
enters. A beat passes and they don't come out.

BACK TO McMURPHY

Satisfied, he crosses to the nurses' station, reaches in the
open side-door window, opens the door and enters.

<b>INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
</b>
as McMurphy enters the nurses' station and looks around.

<b>INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT
</b>
The patients are all asleep. A very long beat, then --

<b>tttMCMURPHY (V.O.)
</b>tt(through loudspeaker; very
ttlow, ominous, drawn out)
tWho knows what evil lurks in the
thearts of men...

Ominous LAUGHTER, then the lights go flashing on and off.

<b>tttMCMURPHY (V.O)
</b>tt(through loudspeaker)
tMedication time! Medication time!
tRise and shine! Rise and shine!
tTime to say goodbye... Everybody
tup, up, up!

Some of the patients immediately pop awake as Candy comes in
and starts hustling the patients out of bed.

<b>tttCANDY
</b>tUp and at 'em, boys.

<b>tttBILLY
</b>tt(waking up)
tH-H-Hi, Candy...

<b>tttCANDY
</b>tHi, Billy.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
MUSIC OVER as the patients are queued up at the nurses'
station where Candy is handing out cups full of whiskey,
McMurphy backing her up, pouring the booze into the cups.
Harding takes his cup and moves back into the day room as
Ellis automatically downs the booze, gags and goes spinning
off across the hallway and is nailed to the wall.

<b>tttttQUICK CUT TO:
</b>
<b>DOWN THE HALL - TURKLE
</b>
sticks his head out the door to check the scene out. Sees
what's happening and comes rushing down the hallway, without
his shirt, and zipping up his pants.

<b>INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
</b>
as Turkle shoves his way to the intercom system and switches
off the lights and music.

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tt(furiously pushing them
ttout)
tYou crazy goons... shut up an' get
toutta here... Out! Out! Out!

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Silence as the last man is driven out of the nurses' station.

Down the hallway, a light goes on in the visitors' room.

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tShit, it's the soo-per-visor come
tto fire my black ass.

A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock at the end of the hallway.
Without losing a beat, Turkle reverses his movement and
starts pushing everybody back into the nurses' station.

<b>tttTURKLE (CONT'D)
</b>tt(pushing)
tGet back in there! In! In! In!

As Turkle pushes the last man into the nurses' station, he
sees Rose stick her head out of the seclusion room.

<b>tttTURKLE (CONT'D)
</b>tt(motioning and shouting)
tStay in there! Stay in there!

Rose ducks back into the seclusion room as, simultaneously,
Turkle closes the door behind him to the nurses' station as
the door to the ward opens and the NIGHT SUPERVISOR, a middle
aged woman, enters the ward.

<b>INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
</b>
as Turkle, shushing the crowd, makes his way to the nurses'
lounge and opens the door.

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tt(harsh whisper)
tAlla ya goons, get in here!

The patients pile into the nurses' lounge, Turkle cramming
the last one through the door and closing it. He turns and
crosses to the side door and steps out.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
as Turkle steps out of the nurses' station, closing the door
behind him.

<b>tttNIGHT SUPERVISOR
</b>tOh, there you are, Mister Turkle.

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tEvenin', ma'am.

<b>tttNIGHT SUPERVISOR
</b>tIs everything all right?

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tt(blocking her way to the

tWhy, sure, ma'am...

<b>tttNIGHT SUPERVISOR
</b>tThe lights were flashing on and
toff, Mister Turkle.

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tJus' cleanin' up, ma'am.

<b>tttNIGHT SUPERVISOR
</b>tAt this hour?

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tCleanliness is a twenty-four-hour
tjob, ma'am...

Harding passes by and enters the latrine.

<b>tttNIGHT SUPERVISOR
</b>tWhat are these men doing up
twandering around?

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tt(leaning in)
tAh guess the natives are restless,
tma'am...

<b>tttNIGHT SUPERVISOR
</b>tt(getting a whiff of his
ttbreath)
tYou've been drinking on the job
tagain, haven't you, Mister Turkle!

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tAh, no, ma'am... well, yes,
tma'am...
tt(leaning in close)
tA man get awful lonely at night, if
tya know what Ah mean, ma'am...

Down the hall, Rose sticks her head out the door, sees what's
happening, and ducks back in as the Night Supervisor turns on
her heel and starts back down the hallway, Turkle at her
heels.

<b>tttNIGHT SUPERVISOR
</b>tI want those men put back to bed,
tMister Turkle!

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tYes, ma'am...

<b>tttNIGHT SUPERVISOR
</b>tAnd you haven't heard the last of
tthis!

<b>tttTURKLE
</b>tYes, ma'am...

She opens the gate, slams it behind her, crosses to the main
door, opers it and exits to:

<b>tttTURKLE (CONT'D)
</b>tt(calling after her)
tNight, night.

Turkle turns and the smile leaves his face as he hurries down
the hallway.

O.S. the TOILET FLUSHES as Turkle stops at the seclusion room
and sticks his head in.

<b>tttTURKLE (CONT'D)
</b>tBe right back, honey...

Turkle closes the door, crosses down to the nurses' station,
and enters as Harding comes out of the latrine.

<b>INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
</b>
as Turkle enters, crosses to the nurses' lounge and opens the
door to see the patients, silhouetted against the open
refrigerator light, moving around, pulling the room apart. It
smacks of Dante's Inferno as Turkle snaps on the light and
steps into the room.

<b>INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT
</b>
as Turkle steps into the room and sees the extent of the
plundering. The filing cabinet is open. So is the medicine
cabinet. Rolls of medical gauze are strewn around, cough
syrup and orange juice are flowing.

The patients start piling out of the room, carrying their
plunder.

Fredrickson and Sefelt are SEEN sitting on the floor, in
front of the open refrigerator, looking through their
dossiers.

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tChrist, they even got my first
tgrade report card here...

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tLemme see...

Sefelt leans in, unintentionally tipping a bottle of cough
syrup in his hand which goes "glug, glug, glug..." all over
the papers.

<b>tttSEFELT (CONT'D)
</b>tJesus, they're terrible grades,
tFred...

Turkle stoically takes in the shattered remains of his job,
unscrews the top to his bottle of whiskey, and takes the
biggest swig of his life as, O.S., Rose is HEARD SCREAMING.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
as Rose, naked as the day she was born, runs screaming down
the hall, Ellis loping after her, reaching out his hand.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
as the others, who are laying out food, drinking booze and
stringing up hospital gauze, turn to see Rose enter the room.
She runs behind McMurphy, pressing her body to his, as he
gently takes hold of Ellis' outstretched hands.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Rose)
tDon't scream, honey...

He gently guides Ellis to the wall, with Rose still clinging
to his back.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tEllis ain't gonna hurt you... Ellis
tis nice... Nice Ellis... see the
tnice lady...

He pins Ellis to the wall.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tThere, see, nice lady touch
tEllis...

Rose reaches out and touches Ellis.

The others stand agog, looking at this Holy Trinity.

<b>tttttDISSOLVE TO:

A SOFT NOSTALGIC NUMBER is HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER as Harding,
Billy and Cheswick watch McMurphy dance with Candy,

Taber.

Martini and Scanlon are busy draping hospital gauze around
the room.

Bromden sits by the window -- waiting.

grind dance, while Martini and Scanlon race around the room
in wheelchairs.

Billy sits, watching Candy and McMurphy, who sit across the
room.

Candy is tired and bored.

McMurphy is drunk and starting to fade.

tWhy don't ya go tell 'er...

Billy doesn't move.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tGo on, son, now's your chance...

Billy slowly crosses toward Candy, stopping halfway to look
back at McMurphy, who gives him an affirmative gesture. He
crosses to Candy, who just looks at him.

</b>tC-C-Candy, wu-wu-will y-y-you mu-mu

<b>tttCANDY
</b>tAh, Billy...

Candy rises, kisses Billy on the cheek, and dances with him.

McMurphy beams on the twosome, unscrews his whiskey bottle,
takes a long pull on the juice, and looks at Bromden.

Bromden sits by the window waiting.

<b>tttttDISSOLVE TO:

as McMurphy, who has nodded off, starts awake and looks
around.

McMURPHY'S POV

Bromden sits by the window waiting.

Cheswick is asleep on the table.

Martini and Scanlon are sitting in their wheelchairs filling
their cups from through the enema tube.

Harding sits, maintaining his aloofness, smoking a cigarette.

Sefelt is sitting on the floor, in a drunken stupor, while
Fredrickson dances around him.

Candy and Billy stand, locked in each other's arms, swaying
to the MUSIC.

McMURPHY

struggles to his feet, steadies himself, crosses to the
nurses' station.

<b>INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT
</b>
as McMurphy enters and goes to Turkle, who is dead asleep.
McMurphy lifts Turkle's keys and leaves.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as McMurphy crosses to Billy and Candy, and gently parting
them, he puts his arms around them -- as much for support as
affection.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tCome on, you lovers, it's gettin'

They move toward the hallway.

Bromden and Harding are the only two who watch them go.

Candy and Billy, hand in hand, enter the small room, which
has a bed in it.

McMurphy closes the door, looks at the keys, and pockets
them. CAMERA TRACKS with McMurphy, who is a very weary man,
back into the day room.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

Cheswick is asleep on the table.

Ellis stands nailed to the wall.

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tCome on, get over there!

McMurphy allows himself to be led to the heavy security
partition, by the men's dorm, where all the patients are
lined up.

It is morning and the day room is a mess:

A few chairs turned over. Paper cups and empty bottles.
Puddles of cough syrup, orange juice and apple juice worked
into sticky masses.

Rose sits by herself on the couch.

Bromden is the last one led to the lineup, where Big Nurse
waits.

Harding shrugs "no."

<b>tttBIG NURSE (CONT'D)

Big Nurse's question is cut off as all the patients and
attendants turn their heads toward the hallway and start
laughing. Big Nurse turns to see Turkle, without his shirt
on, walk into the seclusion room and close the door behind
him.

Big Nurse turns and starts down the hallway, the laughter
trailing after her when, suddenly, the laughter breaks off as
Big Nurse stops and in the silence, she opens the door.

Billy, who lies there, eyes closed, a smile on his face.

Billy pitches forward and collapses on the floor, screaming,
pounding his fists and feet against the floor.

</b>tYes, Miss Ratched!

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tt(to Washington)
tPut him in Doctor Spivey's office!

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tYes, Miss Ratched...

Washington nods to Warren and the two of them scoop Billy off
the floor and carry him screaming to Doctor Spivey's office
as Big Nurse crosses into the nurses' station and picks up
the phone as Candy eases her way into the day room and joins
McMurphy.

A beat, then Miller starts herding the patients toward the
washroom, staying clear of McMurphy and Bromden, who don't
move.

McMurphy pulls the keys out of his pocket.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Candy)
tLet's go!

McMurphy checks the nurses' station, sees Big Nurse is busy
on the telephone.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tt(to Bromden)
tLet's go, Chief...

McMurphy crosses to the window, followed by Bromden, Candy
and Rose, where he begins fumbling with the lock.

<b>MILLER
</b>
as he herds the patients out of the day room. He turns to see
McMurphy trying to open the screen. Miller crosses to
McMurphy.

<b>tttMILLER
</b>tHey, what's gone here?

McMurphy turns around and punches Miller.

<b>INT. NURSES' STATION - MORNING
</b>
as Big Nurse, still on the phone, sees Miller go sprawling
across the floor. She grabs the intercom.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (V.O.)
</b>tt(through loudspeaker)
tWashington! Warren! To the day
troom, immediately!

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - MORNING
</b>
McMurphy opens the screen, raises the window, and helps Candy
and Rose out as Washington and Warren converge on them.
McMurphy and Bromden wheel around.

Washington, Warren and Miller appear around the corner, take
one look, and head straight for McMurphy.

<b>tttWASHINGTON
</b>tt(stopping just short)
t'Kay, let's have the keys an'
tnobody get hurt!

Washington's words are cut off as, O.S., Nurse Pilbow
SCREAMS... a bloodcurdling scream. They turn to see Nurse
Pilbow enter the nurses' station, her uniform splattered with
blood, hysterically talking to Big Nurse (we can't hear her).

Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow rush out of the nurses' station
and head down the hallway.

McMurphy is glued to the spot.

<b>tttCANDY
</b>tt(calling from outside)
tCome on, come on, let's go!

McMurphy hesitates, then moves across the day room toward the
hallway.

<b>INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
CAMERA SHOOTING TOWARD the door, crammed full of patients,
who stare at the scene with curious detached looks, as Big
Nurse and Nurse Pilbow force their way through the patients.
The crowd parts and Big Nurse stops in the doorway, horrified
at what she sees. CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse's reaction. A
beat, then McMurphy appears alongside Big Nurse and is
stricken by what he sees.

McMURPHY AND BIG NURSE'S POV - REVERSE SHOT - DOCTOR SPIVEY'S
<b>OFFICE
</b>
The office is splattered with blood. Billy is lying face up,
hanging over Spivey's desk, dead. His throat and both wrists
are cut. A broken picture frame, containing a photograph of
Spivey's family, lies nearby.

<b>tttMCMURPHY
</b>tBilly, oh, Billy boy...

McMurphy crosses into the room and kneels alongside Billy's
body. He gently lays his hand on Billy's face.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tGet away from him! Don't you dare
ttouch him!

McMurphy turns and leaps at Big Nurse, grabbing her throat;
he drives her into the Acutes and Nurse Pilbow.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
</b>
as McMurphy, Big Nurse, Nurse Pilbow and several Acutes go
down, arms and legs intertwined, kicking, trying to get away
as McMurphy strangles Big Nurse.

Nurse Pilbow screaming, as Washington, Warren, Miller rush
in, trying to break his hold on Big Nurse's throat, her face
turning blue. McMurphy's face, twisted by his passion, when
Washington lands a rabbit punch and MeMurphy's face relaxes
as he passes out.

<b>tttttDISSOLVE TO:

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
</b>
MUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER. The day room is as it was in the
beginning. Harding is dealing out a game of blackjack to
Martini,

Scanlon, Cheswick and Fredrickson.

Taber, pencil in band, sits pondering over a blank sheet of
paper.

Ruckly is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands.

Bancini sits wagging his head, mumbling over and over,
"Tired... awful tired..." Ellis stands against the wall, arms
outstretched.

<b>tttHARDING (V.O.)
</b>tt(over last scene, in
ttMcMurphy's style)
tOkay, suckers, place your bets...

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Bromden is mopping the floor near the security gate to the
visitors' room, when a key hits the lock. Bromden looks up
expectantly.

<b>BROMDEN'S POV
</b>
as Sefelt and Miller enter the visitors' room, cross to the
security gate and pass into the hallway. Bromden goes back to
his mopping.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
</b>
as Sefelt jauntily enters the day room.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (V.O.)
</b>tt(through loudspeaker)
tDid everything go well, Mister
tSefelt?

Sefelt turns to the nurses' station where, inside, Big Nurse
sits very erect, wearing a back brace that reaches up around
her neck. Sefelt shows his teeth and gums to Big Nurse.

<b>tttBIG NURSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>tt(through loudspeaker)
tThat's very nice. Now, doesn't that
tmake you feel better, Mister
tSefelt?

<b>tttSEFELT
</b>tYes, ma'am...

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tGood...

She turns back to her work.

Sefelt crosses to the card game, where he sits and catches
Fredrickson's attention; showing him his teeth. Fredrickson
smiles at Sefelt and blows him a kiss.

<b>tttHARDING

tBig Ace... a lovely lady... another

<b>tttSCANLON

Harding slams his card down on the table, rises and crosses
to the nurses' station where he taps on the side window.

Big Nurse gets up, crosses to the window and slides it open.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tYes, Mister Harding?

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tIs it true McMurphy killed two
tattendants and escaped yesterday?

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tNo. Mister Harding, that is not
ttrue.

<b>tttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
Bromden is squatting, leaning against the wall near the
security gate to the visitors' room, when a KEY HITS THE
LOCK. He looks up expectantly. This time it is McMurphy. Or
what was McMurphy, for his head is bandaged, and his tongue
hangs out of his mouth as he is led across the visitors' room
by an ATTENDANT.

McMurphy shows Bromden no sign of recognition, which Bromden
pays no attention to, thinking McMurphy is putting on the
same act he did when he came back from Electro-Shock Therapy.

Bromden joyously turns and runs down the hallway to the day
room.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
as Bromden crosses into the day room, gets a seat, and sits
facing the hallway, bursting with expectation.

A long beat, then the Attendant appears with McMurphy and
taps at the side door to the nurses' station.

The Acutes break off their card game and look at McMurphy;
their faces hang open at his appearance.

Big Nurse crosses to the side door, opens it, and steps out
into the day room. To the Attendant as she takes McMurphy by
the arm:

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tThank you...

<b>tttATTENDANT
</b>tYes, ma'am...

The Attendant exits.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tt(to McMurphy)
tNow, let's find you a place to sit,
tshall we, Mister McMurphy?

Big Nurse gently guides McMurphy to a seat on the Chronics'
side of the room.

Bromden can hardly contain himself as he waits for McMurphy
to go into his act.

The Acutes have already absorbed the reality of McMurphy's
condition as they exchange looks with each other.

<b>tttFREDRICKSON
</b>tt(whispering)
tLobotomy...

<b>tttHARDING
</b>tYeah...

<b>tttSCANLON
</b>tYeah, that Gary Blinker is fulla
tshit...

The Acutes turn back to their card game as Harding shuffles
and deals the cards out.

Bromden keeps his eyes glued to Big Nurse and McMurphy.

<b>tttBIG NURSE
</b>tt(sitting McMurphy down)
tHere now, you sit here... That's
tit...

Big Nurse pats McMurphy's face and crosses back to the
nurses' station.

McMurphy just sits there, his head lolling to one side.

Bromden waits for McMurphy to go into his routine.

McMurphy just sits there.

Bromden snaps his fingers and slaps his thigh, then waits for
McMurphy to follow suit.

McMurphy just sits there slobbering.

Bromden slaps his thigh again.

No response from McMurphy.

The MUSIC PLAYS ON.

<b>tttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MEN'S DORM - DAYBREAK
</b>
as Bromden stands by the window looking out. A long beat,
then he turns into the room and looks around.

<b>BROMDEN'S POV
</b>
The patients are all asleep. The new night attendant is fast
asleep in the nurses' station.

Bromden quietly takes his pillow and goes to McMurphy's bed,
where he kneels and puts his head very close to McMurphy's. A
long beat as Bromden studies McMurphy's face.

<b>tttBROMDEN
</b>tt(whispering in McMurphy's
ttear)
tWhen I first came here I was so
tscared of being lost I had to
tholler so they could track me... I
tfigured anything was better than
tbeing lost...

On the last word, Bromden places his pillow over McMurphy's
face and begins to suffocate him. McMurphy starts thrashing
and Bromden lies full length on McMurphy. A long beat, then
the thrashing ends. Bromden gets off McMurphy, replaces his
pillow, and crosses down the aisle toward the day room.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAYBREAK
</b>
The night attendant continues to sleep as Bromden passes the
nurses' station, heading for the tub room.

<b>INT. TUB ROOM - DAWN
</b>
as Bromden crosses to the heavy machine which McMurphy had
once tried to lift, sizes it up, then bends over and takes
hold and heaves. The GRINDING WEIGHT is HEARD as Bromden
exerts all his strength, slowly lifts the machine off the
floor, balances it above his shoulders, then crosses out of
the tub room.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAWN
</b>
as Bromden comes around the corner and past the sleeping
night attendant in the nurses' station.

Bromden lines himself up with the window across the room,
then starts toward it, picking up speed as he goes. Then, at
the last moment, he stops and, with an enormous effort, he
hurls the machine through the security screen and the window.
<b>A LOUD CRASH.
</b>
In the nurses' station, the night attendant starts awake and
looks around. Too late as Bromden vaults through the window.
CAMERA HOLDS on window as Bromden runs across the grounds and
disappears into the pine trees.

<b>INT. DAY ROOM - DAWN
</b>
as the night attendant comes out of the nurses' station and
looks confusedly around. Then he spots the shattered window.

<b>EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - SUNRISE
</b>
Rolling hills, forests and distant mountains, bathed in
sunlight, as Bromden runs across a far-off meadow.
