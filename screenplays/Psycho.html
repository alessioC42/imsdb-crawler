</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. PHOENIX, ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT
</b>
tAbove Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a 
thot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and 
tits drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes. 
tWe fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over 
ttraffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business 
tbuildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we 
tapproach downtown section, the character of the city begins 
tto change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We 
tsee railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-
tvegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots.  
tvegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of 
tnefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret.

tWe fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific 
tlocation. A skinny, high old hotel comes into view. On its 
texposed brick side great painted letters advertise "Transients-
tLow Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room." We pause long enough 
tto establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open, 
tcurtainless windows, its silent resigned look so 
tcharacteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward 
twith purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is 
traised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to 
tthree or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants 
tof the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are 
tclose now, so that only the lower half of the window frame 
tis in shot. No sounds come from within the room.

tSuddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between 
tshade and sill, peep into the room.

tA young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears 
ta full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude 
tof physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of 
tthe room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome 
tconflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl 
tnearing the end of her twenties and her rope.

tA man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure 
tvisible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then 
tstart forward. As we pass under the window shade,

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)
</b>
tA small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow 
tbed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the 
tbureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open-
ttop handbag are on the bureau.

tOn the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco-
tCola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There 
tis no radio.

tThe man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt 
tand sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man 
twith warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting 
this neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at 
tMary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps 
ther face turned away from him.

tAfter a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans 
tover and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly, 
tholds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed 
tand finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an 
tinconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow 
tMary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns 
tat her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate, 
tplayful voice.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNever did eat your lunch, did you.

tMary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, 
tkisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings 
ther legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds 
ther shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally 
tpulls away and sits up.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI better get back to the office.  
ttThese extended lunch hours give my 
ttboss excess acid.

tShe rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings 
tout of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or 
tperhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam 
twatches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, 
thumorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they 
toccupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttCall your boss and tell him you're 
tttaking the rest of the afternoon 
ttoff. It's Friday anyway... and hot.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(soft sarcasm)
ttWhat do I do with my free afternoon, 
ttwalk you to the airport?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(meaningfully)
ttWe could laze around here a while 
ttlonger.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttChecking out time is three P.M. Hotels 
ttof this sort aren't interested in 
ttyou when you come in, but when your 
tttime's up...
ttt(a small anguish)
ttSam, I hate having to be with you in 
tta place like this.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI've heard of married couples who 
ttdeliberately spend occasional nights 
ttin cheap hotels. They say it...

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttWhen you're married you can do a lot 
ttof things deliberately.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou sure talk like a girl who's been 
ttmarried.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttSam!

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI'm sorry, Mary.
ttt(after a moment)
ttMy old Dad used to say 'when you 
ttcan't change a situation, laugh at 
ttit.' Nothing ridicules a thing like 
ttlaughing at it.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI've lost my girlish laughter.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(observing)
ttThe only girlish thing you have lost.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(a meaningful quiet, 
tttthen, with difficulty:)
ttSam. This is the last time.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttFor what?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttThis! Meeting you in secret so we 
ttcan be... secretive! You come down 
tthere on business trips and we steal 
ttlunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't 
tteven come.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttOkay. What do we do instead, write 
tteach other lurid love letters?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(about to argue, then 
tttturning away)
ttI haven't time to argue. I'm a working 
ttgirl.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttAnd I'm a working man! We're a regular 
ttworking-class tragedy!
ttt(he laughs)

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttIt is tragic! Or it will be... if we 
ttgo on meeting in shabby hotels 
ttwhenever you can find a tax-deductible 
ttexcuse for flying down deductible 
tthere...

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(interrupting, 
tttseriously)
ttYou can't laugh at it, huh?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttCan you?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttSure. It's like laughing through a 
ttbroken jaw, but...

tHe breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, 
ttries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it.

tIt comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, 
trevealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if 
tcorroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the 
tfallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor 
tagain.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttAnd besides, when you say I make tax-
ttdeductible excuses you make me out a 
ttcriminal.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(having to smile)
ttYou couldn't be a criminal if you 
ttcommitted a major crime.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI wish I were. Not an active criminal 
ttbut... a nice guy with the conscience 
ttof a criminal.
ttt(goes close to mary, 
ttttouches her)
ttNext best thing to no conscience at 
ttall.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(pulling away)
ttI have to go, Sam.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI can come down next week.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNot even just to see you, to have 
ttlunch... in public?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttWe can see each other, we can even 
tthave dinner... but respectably, in 
ttmy house with my mother's picture on 
ttthe mantel and my sister helping me 
ttbroil a big steak for three!

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttAnd after the steak... do we send 
ttSister to the movies and turn Mama's 
ttpicture to the wall?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttSam! No!

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(after a pause, simply)
ttAll right.

tShe stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue 
tthe affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised 
twhen they discover men will continue to want them even after 
tthe sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, 
tplaces his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and 
tsimple sincerity.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttMary, whenever it's possible, tax-
ttdeductible or not, I want to see 
ttdeductible you. And under any 
ttconditions.
ttt(a smile)
ttEven respectability.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttYou make respectability sound...  
ttdisrespectful.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(brightly)
ttI'm all for it! It requires patience 
ttand temperance and a lot of sweating-
ttout... otherwise, though, it's only 
tthard work.
ttt(a pause)
ttBut if I can see you, touch you even 
ttas simply as this... I won't mind.

tHe moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems 
tcrushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI'm fed up with sweating for people 
ttwho aren't there. I sweat to pay off 
ttmy father's debts... and he's in his 
ttgrave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife 
ttalimony, and she's living on the 
ttother side of the world somewhere.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(a smile)
ttI pay, too. They also pay who meet 
ttin hotel rooms.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttA couple of years and the debts will 
ttbe paid off. And if she ever re-
ttmarries, the alimony stops... and 
ttthen...

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI haven't even been married once 
ttyet!

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYeah, but when you do... you'll swing.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(smiling, then with a 
tttterrible urgency)
ttSam, let's go get married.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttAnd live with me in a storeroom behind 
tta hardware store in Fairvale. We'll 
tthave a lot of laughs. When I send my 
ttex-wife her money, you can lick the 
ttstamps.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(a deep desperation)
ttI'll lick the stamps.

tHe looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, 
tlooks out the window and stares at the wide sky.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou know what I'd like? A clear, 
ttempty sky... and a plane, and us in 
ttit... and somewhere a private island 
ttfor sale, where we can run around 
ttwithout our... shoes on.  And the 
ttwherewithal to buy what I'd like.
ttt(he moves away, 
tttsuddenly serious)
ttMary, you want to cut this off, go 
ttout and find yourself someone 
ttavailable.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI'm thinking of it.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(a cheerful shout)
ttHow can you even think a thing like 
ttthat!

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(picking up handbag, 
tttstarting for door)
ttDon't miss your plane.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHey, we can leave together can't we?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(at door)
ttI'm late... and you have to put your 
ttshoes on.

tMary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares 
tdown at his shoeless feet,

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - (DAY) - HIGH ANGLE
</b>
tShooting down at hotel entrance. Mary comes out, walks quickly 
tto a parked cab, gets in. The cab zooms up the awful street.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. LOWERY REAL ESTATE OFFICE - (DAY)
</b>
tA small, moderately successful office off the main street. A 
tcab pulls up at the curb. We see Mary get out of cab, pay 
tdriver, cross pavement to the office door.

<b>tINT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)
</b>
tMary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her 
ttemples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last 
tof her teens.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttIsn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?

<b>ttttCAROLINE
</b>ttt(a high, bright, eager-
tttto-talk voice laced 
tttto-with a vague Texan 
tttaccent)
ttHe's lunching with the man who's 
ttbuying the Harris Street property, 
ttyou know, that oil lease man...  so 
ttthat's why he's late.
ttt(a pause, then, as 
tttMary does not respond 
tttto the pointed thrust)
ttYou getting a headache?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttIt'll pass. Headaches are like 
ttresolutions... you forget them soon 
ttas they stop hurting.

<b>ttttCAROLINE
</b>ttYou got aspirins? I have something... 
ttnot aspirins, but
ttt(cheerfully takes 
tttbottle of pills out 
tttof desk drawer)
ttmy mother's doctor gave these to me 
ttthe day of my wedding.
ttt(laughs)
ttTeddy was furious when he found out 
ttI'd taken tranquilizers!

tShe rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttWere there any calls?

<b>ttttCAROLINE
</b>ttTeddy called.  Me... And my mother 
ttcalled to see if Teddy called. Oh, 
ttand your sister called to say she's 
ttgoing to Tucson to do some buying 
ttand she'll be gone the whole weekend 
ttand...

tShe breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening. 
tMR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the 
toffice. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a 
ttrifle pompous. Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch-
thour load on. He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful 
tvulgarity.

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttWow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls 
ttshould get your boss to air-condition 
ttyou up. He can afford it today.

tLowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead 
tCassidy toward the private office.

<b>ttttLOWERY
</b>ttMary, will you get those copies of 
ttthe deed ready for Mr. Cassidy.

tCassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the 
tdesktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary.

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttTomorrow's the day! My sweet little 
ttgirl...
ttt(laughs as Mary looks 
tttup at him)
ttNot you, my daughter!  A baby, and 
tttomorrow she stands up there and 
ttgets her sweet self married away 
ttfrom me!
ttt(pulling out wallet)
ttI want you to look at my baby.  
ttEighteen years old... and she's never 
tthad an unhappy day in any one of 
ttthose years!
ttt(flashes photo)

tMary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some 
tremark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore 
tthe man's hot-breath closeness.

<b>ttttLOWERY
</b>ttCome on, Tom, my office is air-
ttconditioned.

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttt(ignoring Lowery)
ttYou know what I do with unhappiness? 
ttI buy it off! You unhappy?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttNot inordinately.
ttt(puts deed copy into 
tttCassidy's too-close 
ttthand)

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttI'm buying this house for my baby's 
ttwedding present. Forty thousand 
ttdollars, cash! Now that ain't buying 
tthappiness, that's buying off 
ttunhappiness! That penniless punk 
ttshe's marryin'...
ttt(laughs)
ttProbably a good kid... it's just 
ttthat I hate him.
ttt(looks at deed)
ttYup! Forty thousand, says here...
ttt(to Lowery)
ttCasharoonie!

tHe takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of 
tnew $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under Mary's 
tnose. Caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious 
tgreen bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk. 
tCassidy leans terribly close to Mary, flicks through the 
tbills, laughs wickedly.

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttI never carry more than I can afford 
ttto lose!
ttt(closer to Mary)
ttCount 'em!

<b>ttttLOWERY
</b>ttt(shocked, worried)
ttTom... cash transactions of this 
ttsize! Most irregular...

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttSo what? It's my private money!
ttt(laughs, winks, elbows 
tttLowery)
ttAnd now it's yours.

<b>ttttCAROLINE
</b>ttt(staring at the money)
ttI declare!

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttI don't! That's how I'm able to keep 
ttit!
ttt(laughs)

<b>ttttLOWERY
</b>ttt(hastily interrupting)
ttSuppose we just put this in the safe 
ttand then Monday morning when you're 
ttfeeling good...

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttSpeakin' of feeling good, where's 
ttthat bottle you said you had in your 
ttdesk...
ttt(laughs, as if having 
tttgiven away Lowery's 
tttsecret)
ttOops!
ttt(to Mary, patting her 
tttarm)
ttUsually I can keep my mouth shut!

tHe rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks 
tto Mary, meaningfully.

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttHonest. I can keep any private 
tttransaction a secret... any pri....
ttt(stopped by Mary's 
tttcold gaze)
ttLowery! I'm dyin' of thirstaroonie!

tLowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has 
tgone into Lower's office.

<b>ttttLOWERY
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttI don't even want it in the office 
ttover the weekend. Put it in the safe 
ttdeposit box, at the bank, Mary. And 
ttwe'll get him to give us a check on 
ttMonday - instead.

tHe starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going 
tto come and pull him bodily into the office. When the men 
tare gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle, 
tsmiles at it.

<b>ttttCAROLINE
</b>ttHe was flirting with you. I guess he 
ttnoticed my wedding ring.

tMary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the 
tother from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the 
tfilled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed 
tcopies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office 
tdoor, knocks, starts to open door as:

<b>ttttLOWERY (O.S.)
</b>ttCome in.

<b>tINT. LOWERY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - (DAY)
</b>
tMary opens door, looks in. Cassidy is drinking from a large 
ttumbler, winks at her without pausing in his drinking. Mary 
tremains on threshold a moment, then crosses to the desk, 
ttalking as she goes.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttThe copies. Mr. Lowery, if you don't 
ttmind, I'd like to go right on home 
ttafter the bank. I have a slight...

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttYou go right home!  Me and your boss 
ttare going out to get ourselves a 
ttlittle drinkin' done!
ttt(to Lowery)
ttRight?

<b>ttttLOWERY
</b>ttt(to Mary)
ttOf course. You feeling ill?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttA headache.

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttYou need a week-end in Las Vegas... 
ttplayground of the world!

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI'm going to spend this week-end in 
ttbed.
ttt(starts out)

<b>ttttCASSIDY
</b>ttt(to Lowery)
ttOnly playground that beats Las Vegas!

tMary goes back out into the outer office, closes door.

<b>tINT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)
</b>
tMary goes to her desk, takes the handbag, checks to make 
tsure the money-filled envelope is tucked well down into it. 
tDuring this:

<b>ttttCAROLINE
</b>ttAren't you going to take the pills?
ttt(as Mary shakes her 
ttthead)
ttThey'll knock that headache out.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI don't need pills... just sleep.

tShe goes to the door.

<b>ttttttt DISSOLVE:
</b>
<b>tINT. MARY'S BEDROOM - (DAY)
</b>
tA double bed in the foreground. We just see the far side as 
tthe CAMERA SHOOTS across. Mary enters the scene, clad only 
tin her slip. Perhaps she is about to get into bed. Behind 
ther is an open closet, but too dark inside for us to see any 
tcontents. As Mary turns to the closet the CAMERA LOWERS to 
tshow a close view of the $40,000 in the envelope on our side 
tof the bed.

tMary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on 
tas the CAMERA RETREATS to reveal a packed but not yet closed 
tsuitcase also on the bed. Mary zips up her dress and then 
tbrings some final garments from the closet.

tShe comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top. 
tMary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an 
timpulse which might vanish as quickly as it came.

tThe suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then 
ttakes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money-filled 
tenvelope, and then slams the suitcase shut. Then filled she 
tlooks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small 
tfile-envelope from one of the drawers. It is one of those 
tbrown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and 
tpolicies and certificates. She checks its contents briefly, 
tputs it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her 
tbank book, tosses it on the bed. Then she packs both the 
tfile-envelope and the bank book, into her handbag, takes one 
tquick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and 
tthe suitcase and goes out of the room.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MARY'S GARAGE - (DAY)
</b>
tA two-car garage. One car is gone. Mary's car is parked in 
tthe driveway. The CAMERA is low enough so that we can easily 
tread the Arizona number plate in the foreground.

tMary comes out of house, starts for the trunk, intending to 
tput the suitcase in, changes her mind, places the suitcase 
tand her handbag on the front seat, gets in, starts the car, 
tbegins to back out of driveway.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
</b>
tWe are close on Mary's car, shooting in at her troubled, 
tguilty face. She seems to be driving with that excess care 
tof one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic 
tirregularity. She stops for a red light at a main 
tintersection.

<b>tFROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)
</b>
tWe see Lowery and Cassidy crossing the street, passing right 
tin front of Mary's car.

<b>tMARY'S CAR - (DAY)
</b>
tMary freezes.

<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
</b>
tCassidy, glancing into car, sees Mary, lets out a cheery 
texclamation, elbows Lowery. Lowery turns, sees Mary, smiles 
tpleasantly, pulls Cassidy on.

<b>tMARY'S CAR - (DAY)
</b>
tMary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror 
ton her face.

<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
</b>
tNow we look closely at Lowery. As he reaches the curb, a 
tsmall confusion brightens his face. He remembers that Mary 
tintended to "spend the weekend in bed." He considers, 
tcuriously, turns, looks back at her, a slight frown on his 
tface.

<b>tMARY'S CAR - (DAY)
</b>
tMary sees the pause and the look.

<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
</b>
tFor a moment it even looks as if Lowery might be meaning to 
tcross back to the car.

<b>tMARY'S CAR - (DAY)
</b>
tMary's tension is unbearable. And at that moment we hear the 
tshrill shriek of the traffic cop's whistle.

tMary zooms the car away.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. HIGHWAY - (DAY)
</b>
tMary in car, driving, safely away from town. Her look is 
tless tense now, and more purposeful. After a moment, she 
tchecks the fuel gauge, frowns, looks along highway for a gas 
tstation.

<b>tttttttt FAST DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tMARY'S CAR - (DAY)
</b>
tApproaching and leaving city limits.

<b>tMARY - (DAY)
</b>
tLooks at gas gauge.

<b>tC.U. GAS GAUGE - (DAY)
</b>
<b>tEXT. A GAS STATION - (DAY)
</b>
tWe see Mary's car drive in, come to a stop. There are no 
tother cars about, this being a gas station off the main 
thighway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack. Mary 
tlooks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face 
tturned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.

tNo one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as 
tif the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that 
tshe should listen to. But the gas registers almost empty. 
tShe has to blow her horn.

tA YOUNG MAN comes out of the shack, starts toward her car.

tAt that moment, we HEAR the RINGING of the TELEPHONE in the 
tshack. The Attendant walks a few steps further, toward Mary's 
tcar, then decides to go back and answer the phone. The phone's 
tinsistent ringing unnerves Mary.

tShe starts her car, zooms off.

tWe see the Attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack. 
tHe looks after the departing car with little or no expression.

<b>tCAR
</b>
tThe car grows smaller as it races up the road. The sun is 
tsetting. There is something vaguely ominous about the 
tdarkening sky into which the car seems to be disappearing.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tMARY IN CAR - (NIGHT)
</b>
tThe oncoming headlights hurt Mary's eyes. She is getting 
tsleepy and her vision is blurring. Her eyes close, 
tinvoluntarily, snap open again. She stretches than wide, as 
tif forcing them to stay open. The oncoming lights seem to 
tglare to a point beyond endurance. She murmurs "Sam - Sam."

<b>ttttttttLONG LAP DISSOLVE:
</b>
<b>tEXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)
</b>
tWe see Mary's car, dim in the early dawn, tilted on the soft 
tshoulder of the road, looking somehow sad and pathetic, like 
ta child's thrown-away toy. And from this angle it would appear 
tthat the car is empty.

tAfter a moment, during which there are no other vehicles 
tpassing, we see, coming from the far distance, a HIGHWAY 
tPATROLMAN in a patrol car. He passes Mary's car, notes its 
tapparent emptiness, U-turns, comes back up behind the car. 
tHe gets out and approaches the driver's side window.

tThe Patrolman looks down into the car.

tMary turns with a start, sits up, is startled and unnerved 
tby the sight of the Patrolman, and, as if by automatic reflex, 
tturns the ignition and presses down on the starter.

</b>
tThe Patrolman holds up his hand.

</b>ttt(startled)
ttHold it there!

tMary slams down on the brake, tries to pull herself together. 
tThe Patrolman raps again, less gently.

tReluctantly, Mary rolls down the window. The Patrolman studies 
ther for a moment.

<b>ttttPATROLMAN
</b>ttIn quite a hurry.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttYes.
ttt(because he seems to 
tttbe awaiting an 
tttexplanation)
ttI didn't mean to sleep so long. I 
ttwas afraid I'd have an accident last

ttto pull over...

<b>ttttPATROLMAN
</b>ttYou slept here all night?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(a faint edge of

ttYes. As I said, I couldn't keep my

ttIs anything wrong?

</b>ttOf course not! Am I acting as if...

</b>ttt(almost a smile)
ttFrankly, yes.

</b>ttIs there what?
ttt(not waiting for an

ttI've told you there's nothing wrong...

<b>ttttPATROLMAN
</b>ttt(interrupting, sternly)
ttNow wait just a moment! Turn your

tMary seems about to object, thinks better of it, turns off 
tthe ignition.

<b>ttttPATROLMAN
</b>ttIn the course of my duty, I never 
tt"take up" anyone's time, whether 
ttit's to give a warning, or a ticket, 
ttor help! Believe that, M'am.
ttt(a little softer)
ttNow if you woke up on the wrong side 
ttof... the car seat, that's one thing. 
ttBut when you act as if I've just 
ttplaced you under arrest...

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI'm sorry.

<b>ttttPATROLMAN
</b>ttNo need to apologize...

tMary starts the car, her face turned as if she wishes the 
tmatter were all settled and the Patrolman had already gone. 
tThe Patrolman isn't exactly one of those civil servants who 
tdemands a thank-you, but he does feel her manner is a bit 
ttoo abrupt. He calls:

<b>ttttPATROLMAN
</b>ttWait a minute!

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(jamming down the 
tttbrake)
ttNow what?

tThe Patrolman gazes at her a moment, then:

<b>ttttPATROLMAN
</b>ttMay I see your license?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttPATROLMAN
</b>ttPlease.

tMary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed 
tit when she stretched out for sleep. She puts her hand in 
tit, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it.

tThe Patrolman is staring at her. She glances at him nervously, 
tpokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to 
tremove some of its contents. Nervously, badly controlling 
ther fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then 
tthe important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other 
titems, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet, 
topens it, hands it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at 
tthe car.

<b>tEXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)
</b>
tThe Patrolman walks around to the front of the car, checks 
tthe license plate, and returns.

<b>tINT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)
</b>
tThe Patrolman peers in, checks the car registration on the 
tsteering wheel, returns Mary's wallet.

tShe takes it, looks at him for a flicker of a moment.

tHe says nothing. She starts ahead, fast.

<b>tEXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)
</b>
tThe Patrolman stares after Mary as she drives off, then starts 
tback to his automobile.

<b>tMARY IN CAR - (DAWN)
</b>
tShe is quite shaken, realizes she caused herself a great 
tdeal of trouble and placed herself in unnecessary danger. 
tShe is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability 
tto act normally under the pressure of guilt. As she drives, 
tshe glances into her rear-view mirror.

<b>tMARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)
</b>
tThe Patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind 
ther at a matched speed.

tShe glances out at her surroundings.

</b>
tThe Freeway ahead.

</b>
tShe suddenly turns off the highway.

</b>
tShe checks her mirror.

<b>tMARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)
</b>
tThe Patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off 
tafter her.

<b>tMARY IN CAR - (DAWN)
</b>
tShe breathes a sigh of relief, thinks a moment, makes a quick 
tdecision.

<b>ttttttt DISSOLVE:
</b>
<b>tEXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
</b>
tThe big sign reads "California Charlie - Automobile Paradise." 
tWe see Mary's car drive onto the lot and stop. Mary gets out 
tof the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention 
tto the line of cars, notice the California licence plates on 
tall of them. The CAR DEALER calls out from his office:

<b>ttttCAR DEALER
</b>ttWith you in a second!

tMary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making 
ta selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand 
ton the corner, just outside the lot.

tShe stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is 
tfearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy 
therself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, 
tpicks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car 
tlot as she glances worried at the front page. As she goes, 
twe see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same 
tPATROLMAN. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite 
tside of the street, stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in 
tthe newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see 
tthe Patrolman.

tThe car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting 
tfor Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles.

<b>ttttCAR DEALER
</b>ttI'm in no mood for trouble!

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(glancing up, thrown 
tttfor a moment)
ttWhat?

<b>ttttCAR DEALER
</b>ttt(cheerfully)
ttThere's an old saying, "First customer

</b>ttNo. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I

tShe stops suddenly, almost with a gasp. She has seen the 
tPatrolman.

<b>tTHE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
</b>
tHe is staring over at her, his face dispassionate.

<b>tEXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

tMary has to force herself to look away.

</b>ttOne thing people never ought to be 
ttwhen they're buying a used car is in

ttt(starting away toward 
ttther car)
ttBut like I said, too nice a day for 
ttarguing. I'll just shoot this into 
ttthe garage.

tHe starts into Mary's car. She looks at him, in near panic, 
twanting to skip the whole thing. Torn, wondering if the 
tpresence of the Patrolman doesn't negate the value of changing 
tcars, wondering how she can get away, wondering if she'll be 
tfollowed, or if the Patrolman will go away if she does stay 
there.

tAll these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing. 
tThe Car Dealer has driven her car into the garage. She stands 
tin the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target. 
tShe looks toward the garage.

<b>tTHE GARAGE - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
</b>
tMary's car is in it.

</b>
tMary decides she cannot back out now without arousing further 
tsuspicion, is compelled to look again at the Patrolman.

<b>tTHE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
</b>
tHe still watches. With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she 
tgoes to a close car, looks at it. The Car Dealer is returning.

<b>ttttCAR DEALER
</b>ttThat's the one I'd've picked for you 
ttmyself!

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttHow much?

<b>ttttCAR DEALER
</b>ttGo ahead! Spin it around the block. 
ttNow I know you don't know anything

</b>ttIt looks fine. How much will it be,

ttYou are in a hurry! Somebody chasin'

</b>ttWell... heck, this is the first time

ttt(laughs, sees she is

</b>ttFive hundred.

</b>ttAha! Always got time to argue money,

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttAll right.

tAs the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches 
tinto her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses.

</b>ttt(slowly)
ttI take it... you can prove that car's

</b>ttIn the building ...
ttt(indicates, continues 
tttto stare quietly)
ttMary starts for the building, glancing 
ttonce in the direction of the

</b>
tMary goes into the office building.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>

</b>
tMary enters, locks door, takes envelope out of her handbag, 
textracts one bundle of bills from the envelope, counts off 
tfive, puts the bundle back into the envelope and the envelope 
tback into the bag. Then she remembers, takes out the important 
tpapers envelope, goes through it, finds several papers having 
tto do with her car, takes them all out, puts back the 
tenvelope, starts out of the ladies Room.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:

tThe Car Dealer has moved the car of her choice out of the

</b>ttt(too cheerfully)
ttI think you'd better give it a trial

ttI'd like to be ready when he gets

<b>ttttCAR DEALER
</b>ttOkay. If you'll come along...

tHe starts toward the office building. Mary follows, closely, 
tanxiously. She glances, sees:

<b>tTHE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)
</b>
tHe is still at the far curb.

<b>tEXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)
</b>
tThe Car Dealer goes into his office. Mary follows.

<b>tTHE PATROLMAN - (DAY)
</b>
tA second later, he starts his automobile, checks traffic, 
tcomes across the street, slowly, and drives onto the lot. He 
tpauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the 
toffice, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's 
tcar is driven back onto the lot.

tThe MECHANIC stops Mary's car, hops out, waves to the 
tPatrolman. The Patrolman waves back, goes on a bit until he 
tis behind Mary's car, stops again, looks over at the office. 
tIn a moment, Mary comes out, hurries across to her new car, 
tgets in, starts the motor. The Mechanic yells:

<b>ttttMECHANIC
</b>ttHey! Miss?

tMary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic. 
tHer face goes white. She doesn't know which man called her. 
tThen the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(as Mechanic reaches 
tttcar)
ttJust put it right in here, please... 
ttbeside me.

tThe Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off. 
tAs she drives out of lot we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer 
tand the Patrolman all looking after her.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tMARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
</b>
tMary is driving tensely. She checks the rear-view mirror, is 
tmore shocked than pleased when she sees...

</b>
tNo sign of the Patrolman.

<b>tMARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
</b>
tShe turns her face, looks out at the highway.

<b>tROUTE 99 - MARY'S POV
</b>
tIt is heavy with traffic.

<b>tMARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
</b>
tAgain she checks the mirror and although...

<b>tMARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR
</b>
tThere is still no sign of the Patrolman.

<b>tMARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE
</b>
tShe cannot relax or feel safe, cannot convince herself that 
tnothing will come of the man's watching and suspicions.

tCAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, 
ther fears. Her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a 
tperson unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this 
trealistic a situation. Suddenly, we hear the SOUND of the 
tUsed Car Dealer's laugh, hear it as clearly as Mary hears it 
tin her imagination. The "imagined voice" we hear is actually 
tthe voice of the Car Dealer:

<b>ttttCAR DEALER'S VOICE
</b>ttHeck, Officer, that was the first 
tttime I ever saw the Customer high-
ttpressure the Salesman!  Somebody 
ttchasing her?

</b>ttI better have a look at those papers, 
ttCharlie.

<b>ttttCAR DEALER'S VOICE
</b>ttShe look like a wrong-one to you?

<b>ttttPATROLMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttActed like one.

tMary blinks, shakes her head, as if trying to shake away 
tthese voices of her imagination. She checks the rear-view 
tmirror.

<b>tMARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR
</b>
tStill no sight of the Patrolman.

<b>tMARY IN NEW CAR
</b>
tShe tries to force herself to relax, almost succeeds when 
tshe is sprung to tension again by....

<b>tEXT. HIGHWAY
</b>
tThe sight of a police car. As she drives past, we hear the 
tsqueaky, unintelligible voice coming over the car radio. 
tMary zooms down on the gas, whizzes ahead.

tHer eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought.

tWe can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk.

<b>tMARY IN NEW CAR

tWe HEAR the sound of an agitated BUZZ of an intercom system, 
ta sound emanating from Mary's imagination.

tAfter the second BUZZ, we HEAR the voice of Caroline.

</b>ttYes, Mr. Lowery.

</b>ttt(a worried tone)
ttCaroline...? Mary still isn't in?

</b>ttNo, Mr. Lowery... but then she's 
ttalways a bit late on Monday mornings.

<b>ttttLOWERY'S VOICE
</b>ttBuzz me the minute she comes in.

tAgain Mary shakes her head, forces herself to stop hearing 
tthese "invented" scenes of her imagination.

<b>tEXT. HIGHWAY
</b>
tNow we cut to the view of the road, from Mary's viewpoint. 
tDarkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight we see 
tthe neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations 
tbeginning to blaze on.

<b>tINT. MARY'S NEW CAR
</b>
tBack on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices 
tagain:

</b>ttCall her sister! If no one's answering 
ttat the house....

<b>ttttCAROLINE'S VOICE
</b>ttI called her sister, Mr. Lowery, 
ttwhere she works, the Music Makers

ttknow where Mary is any more than we

<b>ttttLOWERY'S VOICE
</b>ttYou better run out to the house.  
ttShe may be... unable to answer the

<b>ttttCAROLINE'S VOICE
</b>ttHer sister's going to do that.  She's 
ttas worried as we are.

tA flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face. 
tShe closes her eyes for one tight swift moment.

tWe cut again to the highway. The first oncoming headlights 
tslash at the windshield.

<b>tINT. MARY'S NEW CAR
</b>
tCutting back to Mary, we can sense by the tense muscles of 
ther face that she is driving faster. The oncoming headlights 
tblurt at her.

tSuddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as 
tif the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break 
tthrough Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her 
timagination blank.

<b>ttttLOWERY'S VOICE
</b>ttNo! I haven't the faintest idea.  As 
ttI said, I last saw your sister when

ttAh, I think you'd better come over

ttCaroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.

tIt is completely dark now, night.

tA look of revulsion makes Mary close her eyes.

tShe is becoming aware of the rain starting.

tAs we move closer, we see the neon sign more clearly and can 
tfaintly make out the large letters which read "Motel."  Mary 
tstops the car, lowers the window slightly, looks out. We see 
tthe sign clearly now: "BATES MOTEL." Mary opens the car door 
tand dashes out into the rain and up onto the porch of the 
tmotel office.

tFOLLOWS her into office. There is no one present. Mary goes 
tto the desk, rings a small pushbell. There is no response. 
tMary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration, goes 
tback out onto the porch. She looks off in another direction, 
tslightly behind the office, and sees...

tA path from the motel office leads directly up to this house. 
tThere is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms. A WOMAN 
tpasses the window, pauses, peers out.

tWe see her in clear silhouette. She quickly goes away from 
tthe window.

<b>tEXT. PORCH OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)
</b>
tMary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get 
tsome attention. She stands a few moments, waiting.

tNo one comes. Impatience and anger rise in Mary. She dashes 
tout into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window, 
tbegins to honk the horn. After a moment, a YOUNG MAN open 
tthe front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path. 
tAfter a few steps, he turns and runs back into the house. 
tMary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the 
tporch. As she runs, we see that the Young Man has gone back 
tonly to get an umbrella. Seeing that Mary is on her way to 
tthe porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his 
thand. He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached 
tit.

tHe stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging 
tuseless in his hand, then back to her.

tThere is something sadly touching in his manner, in his look. 
tMary's impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him 
talmost smile. He gestures her into the office, standing back 
tto indicate that he will go after her. She goes into the 
toffice.

<b>tINT. OFFICE OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)
</b>
tThe Young Man follows Mary in, closes the door. He is NORMAN 
tBATES, somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft-
tspoken and hesitant.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttDirty night.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(not really a question)
ttYou have a vacancy?

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttt(simply, almost 
tttcheerfully)
ttWe have twelve vacancies. Twelve 
ttcabins, twelve vacancies.
ttt(a pause)
ttThey moved away the highway.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI thought I'd gotten off the main...

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttI knew you must have. No one stops 
tthere anymore unless they do.

tHe is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration 
tbook.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttBut it's no good dwelling on our 
ttlosses, is it.  We go right ahead 
ttlighting signs and following the 
ttformalities...  Would you sign, 
ttplease.

tMary has placed her handbag on the counter. She takes the 
tregistration book, picks up the pen, is suddenly struck with 
tthe realization that she'd better use an alias. She writes 
tthe name Marie Samuels.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttYour home address. Oh, just the town 
ttwill do.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(glancing at newspaper 
tttsticking out of her 
ttthandbag)
ttLos Angeles.

tShe realizes he didn't ask her to tell him, merely to write 
tit down. She smiles, writes Los Angeles beside the false 
tname. Norman smiles, stops smiling out of embarrassment.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttCabin One. It's closer in case you 
ttwant anything... right next to the 
ttoffice.

<b>tCLOSEUP - NORMAN
</b>
tHe removes a key for Cabin One. We see that there is a 
tremaining key on the board.

<b>tTWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN
</b>
<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI want sleep more than anything.  
ttExcept maybe, food.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttThere's a big diner about ten miles 
tton up... just outside Fairvale.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttAm I that close to Fairvale?

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttFifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

tHe goes to door, opens it. The rain has slowed down 
tconsiderably. He smiles at this fact, as if to communicate 
tsome pleasure he finds in it. Mary follows him to the door, 
tgoes out on the porch, waits and watches as Norman runs to 
ther car, gets in, drives it to the parking space in front of 
tCabin One. Mary walks along the porch, waits before the door 
tof Cabin One.

tNorman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door, 
topens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches 
ton a light. Mary goes into the cabin. Norman follows her.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttThere's no name for it... But it's

ttat ease.

ttYou're not going to go out again and

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttThen will you do me a favor?
ttt(without waiting for 
ttther response)
ttWill you have supper here?  I was 
ttjust about to, myself... nothing 
ttmore than some sandwiches and a lot 
ttof milk, but I'd like it if you'd 
ttcome up to the house and... I don't

ttawful homey.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI'd like to.

</b>ttAll right, you get your dresses

ttshoes, and I'll come for you soon as

ttt(starts out)
tt...with my trusty umbrella.
ttt(he laughs a small 
tttlaugh, runs off)

tMary closes the door, goes to suitcase, opens it, starts to 
ttake out a dress. Her handbag is next to the suitcase. She 
tglances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into 
tthe handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at 
tit, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides 
tto, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks 
tabout, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such 
tplaces are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her 
tbag, she hits on a solution. She opens the newspaper, places 
tthe envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again and then 
tplaces it on the bedside table as if it were there for later 
treading. She considers this for a moment, accepts it, goes 
tto her suitcase to start unpacking.

tSuddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill, ugly sound of 
ta woman's voice, raised in anger.

<b>ttttWOMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttNo! I tell you no!

tMary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible 
tvoice is coming from the house behind the cabins. CAMERA 
tFOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is 
tstill on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming 
tfrom that room. The rain has stopped and the moon is out.

<b>ttttWOMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttI won't have you bringing strange

<b>ttttNORMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttt(blurted cut fury and

ttShut up! Shut up!

tThere is the SOUND of a door closing in that room up there. 
tMary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress 
tand concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes 
tsadly at the little empty room.

tIn a moment there is the SOUND of the house's front door 
tslamming shut. Mary turns, looks out the window.

<b>tFROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT)
</b>
tWe see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered 
ttray.

<b>tINT. CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)
</b>
tMary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to 
tthe door, opens it and goes out onto the porch.

<b>tEXT. THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)
</b>
tMary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when 
tNorman comes round the building and walks along the porch, 
tpast the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He 
tstares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her 
teye.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI've caused you some trouble.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttMother...
ttt(a hollow little laugh, 
tttan attempt at sardonic 
ttthumor)
tt...what is the phrase... "she isn't 
ttherself today"... I think that's it.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(looking at the tray)
ttYou shouldn't have bothered. I really 
ttdon't have that much of an appetite.

tNorman flinches, realizing she has heard his mother's 
treference to Mary's appetite.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttI'm sorry. I wish... people could 
ttapologize for other people.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttDon't worry about it.
ttt(a warm smile)
ttBut as long as you've made us supper, 
ttwe may as well eat it. Huh?

tShe begins to back into her room. Norman starts to follow, 
thesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young 
twoman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in 
tdefiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his 
tdefiance for one day. He cannot go into Mary's room.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttIt might be nicer... warmer in the 
ttoffice.

tWithout waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries 
tto the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused 
tsympathy, then follows.

<b>tINT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)
</b>
tNorman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable 
tplace to spread out a supper. He turns, sees Mary standing 
tin the doorway.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttEating in an office...
ttt(a rueful smile)
tt...to officious, even for me. I have 
ttthe parlor behind this... if you'd 
ttlike.

tMary nods. Norman walks on, behind the counter and into the 
tdarkened parlor. Mary follows.

<b>tINT. NORMAN'S PARLOR -(NIGHT)
</b>
tIn the darkened room, lit only by the light from the office 
tspilling in, we see Norman placing the tray on a table. Mary 
tcomes to the doorway, pauses. Norman straightens up, goes to 
tlamp, turns on the light.

tMary is startled by the room. Even in the dimness of one 
tlamp, the strange, extraordinary nature of the room rushes 
tup at one. It is a room of birds. Stuffed birds, all over 
tthe room, on every available surface, one even clinging to 
tthe old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp. The birds are 
tof many varieties, beautiful, grand, horrible, preying. Mary 
tstares in awe and a certain fascinated horror.

<b>tCLOSE UP - THE VARIOUS BIRDS TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN
</b>
<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttPlease sit down. On the sofa.

tAs Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and 
tpouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She studies 
tthe birds as she walks, briefly examines a bookcase stacked 
twith books on the subject of "Taxidermy."

<b>tCLOSE UP - THE BOOKS ON TAXIDERMY MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARY
</b>
tShe notices, too, the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, 
tand many with a vaguely religious overtone.

tFinally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttYou're very... kind.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttIt's all for you. I'm not hungry.  
ttPlease go ahead.

tMary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a 
tsmall slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in 
tthe manner of one disturbed and preoccupied.

tNorman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles 
tand then laughs.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttYou eat like a bird.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttYou'd know, of course.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttNot really. I hear that expression, 
ttthat one eats "like a bird," is really 
tta falsie, I mean a falsity, because 
ttbirds eat a tremendous lot.
ttt(A pause, then 
tttexplaining)
ttOh, I don't know anything about birds. 
ttMy hobby is stuffing things... 
tttaxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather 
ttstuff birds because...  well, I hate 
ttthe look of beasts when they're 
ttstuffed, foxes and chimps and all... 
ttsome people even stuff dogs and 
ttcats... but I can't... I think only 
ttbirds look well stuffed because 
ttthey're rather...  passive, to begin 
ttwith... most of them...

tHe trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return 
tof his natural hesitancy and discomfort. Mary looks at him, 
twith some compression, smiles.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttIt's a strange hobby. Curious, I 
ttmean.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttUncommon, too.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI imagine so.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttIt's not as expensive as you'd think. 
ttCheap, really. Needles, thread, 
ttsawdust .. the chemicals are all 
ttthat cost anything.
ttt(He goes quiet, looks 
tttdisturbed)

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttA man should have a hobby.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttIt's more than a hobby... sometimes... 
tta hobby is supposed to pass the time, 
ttnot fill it.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(after a pause, softly)
ttIs your time so empty?

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttOh, no!
ttt(forcing brightness 
tttagain)
ttI run the office, tend the cabins 
ttand grounds, do little chores for

ttbe capable of doing.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttYou go out... with friends?

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttFriends? Who needs friends.

tttgallows humor)
ttA boy's best friend is his mother.
ttt(Stops laughing)
ttYou've never had an empty moment in 
ttyour whole life. Have you?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttOnly my share.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttWhere are you going? I don't mean to

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(A wistful smile)
ttI'm looking for a private island.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttWhat are you running away from?

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(Alert)
ttWhy do you ask that?

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttNo. People never run away from 
ttanything.
ttt(A pause)
ttThe rain didn't last very long.
ttt(Turning suddenly)
ttYou know what I think? I think we're 
ttall in our private traps, clamped in 
ttthem, and none of us can ever climb 
ttout. We scratch and claw... but only 
ttat the air, only at each other, and 
ttfor all of it, we never budge an 
ttinch.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttSometimes we deliberately step into 
ttthose traps.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttI was born in mine. I don't mind it 
ttanymore.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttYou should... mind it.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttOh I do... but I say I don't.
ttt(Laughs boyishly)

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(Staring at him, 
tttshaking her head

ttIf anyone ever spoke to me, the way

ttI don't think I could ever laugh 
ttagain.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttt(Controlled resentment)
ttSometimes when she talks that way to

ttleave her forever!
ttt(A rueful smile)
ttOr at least, defy her.
ttt(A pause, a hopeless 
tttshrug)
ttBut I couldn't. She's ill.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttShe sounded strong...

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttI mean... ill.
ttt(A pause)
ttShe had to raise me all by herself

ttHe talked her into building this

ttIt was just too much for her when he 
ttdied, too... And the way he died... 
ttOh, it's nothing to talk about when

ttAnyway, it was too much of a loss

</b>ttTo a private island, like you?

</b>ttNo, not like me.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttIt's too late for me. And besides...

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttt(Slowly, carefully)
ttWouldn't it be better if you put her

tShe hesitates. Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a 
tstriking coldness.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttAn Institution? A madhouse?  People 
ttalways call a madhouse "someplace."
ttt(Mimicing coldly)
ttPut her in Someplace!

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttI'm sorry... I didn't mean it to

</b>ttt(The coldness turning 
tttto tight fury)
ttWhat do you mean about caring?  Have

ttWell? You meant well?  People always

tThe fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks 
tback into his chair. There is a brief silence.

tMary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained 
tby his anguish.

<b>ttttNORMAN

tttof the name in the

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttGood night.

tShe goes out of the parlor. We see her, from Norman's 
tviewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into 
tthe night. Norman turns and looks at the table, and we see 
this face now. It is bright with that drunken-like look of 
tdetermination and encouragement and like resolve. He starts 
tto clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of 
tMary's door in the cabin next door.

tHe holds still, listens. He goes into the office and looks 
tat the book.

<b>tC.U. - THE NAME "SAMUELS"
</b>
<b>tM.S. - NORMAN
</b>
tHe goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression. 
tThe sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft 
tSOUNDS, somehow intimate in the night quiet. Norman turns 
this ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting 
tan impulse to listen, or more than listen.

tBut slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and, 
tresisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of 
this head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too 
thad our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at a 
tpicture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning 
tagainst. Slowly he starts toward it.

tHe reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame 
toff the wall.

tA tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the 
thole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is 
tvery dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light 
tstriking Norman's face.

tWe move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile 
tfills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. See 
tthe small hole through which the light comes. Norman peeps 
tthrough.

<b>tNORMAN'S VIEWPOINT
</b>
tThrough the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary 
tundressing. She is in her bra and halfslip. She stoops over 
ta bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to 
tunhook her bra.

<b>tNORMAN - ECU
</b>
tHe watches as Mary removes her bra. We see his eye run up 
tand down the unseen figure of Mary.

<b>tNORMAN'S VIEWPOINT
</b>
tMary, just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity.

<b>tNORMAN
</b>
tHe turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues 
tturning until he can look out the small parlor window.

tWe see, as he sees...

<b>tTHE HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND
</b>
<b>tNORMAN
</b>
tHe turns his face away, quickly, resentfully. In his face we 
tsee anger and anguish. And then resolve.

tQuickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in 
tthe wall, turns, starts out of the parlor. We see him go 
tthrough the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering 
tto close the door behind him.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE MOTEL OFFICE PORCH - (NIGHT)
</b>
tNorman walking along the porch, in the direction of the big 
thouse. Once on the path he pauses, looks up at the light in 
tthe bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his 
tshoulders, strides manfully up the path.

tCAMERA follows behind him. He opens the door of the house, 
tenters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look 
tup at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He 
tholds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage 
tevaporates. His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully. He by-
tpasses the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen. 
tAt the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen, drops 
twearily into a chair. After a moment, he stretches out a leg 
tand gently pushes the kitchen door closed.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. MARY'S MOTEL ROOM - (NIGHT)
</b>
tMary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a 
tsmall notebook. We see from these figures a calculation which 
tindicates her intention to make a restitution of the money 
tshe has used of the forty thousand dollars. We see, too, her 
tbankbook. The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly 
tbeneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after 
tsubtraction, 39,500. In another spot we see a figure which 
tmatches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00.

tBeneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after 
tsubtraction, 124.00. She studies the figures, sighs, not 
twearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure 
tthat comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to 
tcontinue doing the right thing. After a moment she tears the 
tpage out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into 
tsmall pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces 
tinto the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. Then she drops her 
trobe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on.

<b>tINT. MARY IN SHOWER
</b>
tOver the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see 
tthe bathroom door, not entirely closed. For a moment we watch 
tMary as she washes and soaps herself.

tThere is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she 
tlooks somewhat relieved.

tNow we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open.

tThe noise of the shower drowns out any sound. The door is 
tthen slowly and carefully closed.

tAnd we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower 
tcurtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. The white 
tbrightness of the bathroom is almost blinding.

tSuddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain, 
trip it aside.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tMARY - ECU
</b>
tAs she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower 
tcurtain being torn aside. A look of pure horror erupts in 
ther face. A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her 
tthroat. A hand comes into the shot. The hand holds an enormous 
tbread knife. The flint of the blade shatters the screen to 
tan almost total, silver blankness.

<b>tTHE SLASHING
</b>
tAn impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very 
tscreen, ripping the film. Over it the brief gulps of 
tscreaming. And then silence. And then the dreadful thump as 
tMary's body falls in the tub.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE
</b>
tThe blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand 
tpulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a 
tglimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with 
tmadness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a 
tfright-wig.  And then we see only the curtain, closed across 
tthe tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the 
tshower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a 
tmoment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE DEAD BODY
</b>
tLying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over, 
ttouching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if 
tpopped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor.  
tComing down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along 
tthe porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA 
tFOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the 
tbathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As CAMERA 
tapproaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed 
tit on the bedside table.

<b>tCLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER
</b>
tbeside the bed. The CAMERA now moves away over to the window 
tand looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, 
tcoming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, 
tshocked voice.

<b>ttttNORMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttMother! Oh God, what... blood, 
ttblood... mother...!

tWe cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations.

tAfter a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the 
tfront door, dashes down the path toward the motel.

<b>ttttttQUICK CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE PATH - (NIGHT)
</b>
tNorman is coming AT CAMERA, running head-on. He dashes into 
tan extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in 
this face. CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman 
truns to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's 
troom.

<b>tINT. MARY'S CABIN - (NIGHT)
</b>
tNorman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the 
troom, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open. 
tHe goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body.

tSlowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face, 
tcovers his eyes, turns his face away. Then he crosses to the 
twindow, looks out at the house. Shot is so angled that we 
tsee the bedside table with the newspaper on it.

tAfter a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the 
tedge of the bed.

<b>tFRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN
</b>
tNorman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can 
tsee only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile 
tfloor. Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of 
this dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the 
tpeace that comes with decision.

tNorman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with 
tresolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across 
tit. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch, 
tand draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the 
tbedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from 
tthe bathroom. He opens the front door, goes out.

<b>tEXT. THE HOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)
</b>
tNorman comes out of Mary's cabin, closes the door carefully 
tbehind him, goes along the porch to his office, goes in. We 
tstay outside. Immediately, the "Vacancy" sign goes off, and 
tthen the motel sign goes off. As CAMERA GOES closer to the 
toffice, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door 
topening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up. Norman 
tcomes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about, 
tgoes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes into 
tMary's cabin, closing the door after him.

<b>tINT. MARY'S CABIN
</b>
tWith the paper in the foreground, Norman enters. We can see 
thim in the dim spill of light. He pauses by the door, then 
tgathers his strength and goes into the bathroom. We HEAR him 
tset the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower 
tbeing turned off. And there is total silence. CAMERA MOVES 
tFORWARD so that we can see into bathroom.

tCAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up. 
tQuickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges 
twith it into the bedroom. CAMERA PANS down and we see him 
tspread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside 
tthe bathroom door. He spreads the curtain so that one end of 
tit comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over 
tand onto the tile floor. Again he goes into the bathroom and 
tCAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman. 
tHe works carefully, with his arms extended away from his 
tbody, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it 
tacross the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain 
tin the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up, 
texamines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to 
tthe bathroom, goes to the hand-basin.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT
</b>
tWe see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being 
tdiluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water.

<b>tNORMAN
</b>
tWe see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn 
tto the job of cleaning the bathroom.

tHe places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the 
tmop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the 
twall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and 
teven the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel 
tand goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them.  
tFinally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail, 
tcleans out the tub, and goes out into the bedroom.

<b>tINT. MARY'S BEDROOM
</b>
tNorman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to 
tthe desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of 
ther car keys. He suddenly notices them lying on the desk, 
twhere he'd thrown them after parking her car. He picks up 
tthe keys, crosses the room, goes out.

<b>tEXT. THE PORCH
</b>
tWe see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then 
thurry across the porch and into Mary's car. He circle-turns 
tthe car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch, 
tdirectly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go.

tThen he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key 
tand, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back into the cabin.

<b>tINT. MARY'S ROOM
</b>
tFrom a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to 
twrap the shower curtain around the body. We see the edges of 
tthe curtain as they are raised and laid down again. Then he 
tpicks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his 
tfoot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind 
thim, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body 
tin the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it. 
tHe comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, 
tflicks on the light.

tAgain the newspaper is in the foreground. For a moment he 
tpauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he 
tis doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues 
twith his work. With the room lighted, he now proceeds to 
tgather up all Mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase. 
tHe checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks 
tunder bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that 
troom again, comes back into the bedroom, looks about 
tcarefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that into the 
tsuitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl 
tare gone from the room. Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks 
tit up.

tWith his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the 
tmop and the used towels. He crosses to the door, switches 
toff the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts 
tout.

<b>tEXT. THE PORCH
</b>
tAs Norman stands in the doorway, he is suddenly and blindingly 
tlit by the bright headlights of a passing car. The flash of 
tthe lights and the SOUND of the SPEEDING CAR are over in a 
tflicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman 
tto regain his former tense composure. Then he goes to the 
tcar trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and 
tthe pail into it, slams it shut. He pauses a moment, then 
trealizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin. 
tHe returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the 
tnewspaper on the bedside table. He goes to it, takes the 
tnewspaper, and looks once again into the bathroom. His glance 
tgoes right over the toilet bowl.

tHe turns out the lights, crosses the darkened cabin, goes 
tout onto the porch.

tHe reopens the trunk, tosses in the newspaper and closes it. 
tHe goes around and jumps into the car and starts away.

tWe HOLD on the trunk, follow it for a while, then

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)
</b>
tThe car pulls away from a CLOSE ANGLE on the trunk and as 
tCAMERA HOLDS we see that we are now in a swamp area.

tIt is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects. 
tNorman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns 
toff the lights, gets out, leaving door open. He looks at the 
tswamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car, 
trealizes he has no choice. He leans into the car, releases 
tthe emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car 
tbegins to roll into the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW, 
tTHROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens.

tThe SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane 
tflying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps 
taway, slams the door shut, stands tense. The SOUND of the 
tplane overhead grows louder.

tNorman looks up.

<b>tNORMAN'S VIEWPOINT - THE BLACK SKY
</b>
tWe see no plane. The SOUND of the motor is beginning to 
tdiminish.

<b>tttttt CUT BACK TO:
</b>
<b>tNORMAN
</b>
tWe see the relief in his face. He looks at the car.

tMore than two-thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp. 
tThe trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime, 
tas if refusing to go the rest of the way. Norman begins to 
tpanic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot. And 
tslowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear 
tonly the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only 
tthe small after-bubble, like a visual burp.

tNorman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire 
tmarks, so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp.

tHe stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we:

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tCLOSE UP NORMAN
</b>
tstanding on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post. 
tHe is staring out into the night, a look of guarded, casual 
tinnocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment 
tof peaceful night air before retiring. Then he glances down 
tand CAMERA follows his gaze. A hose is lying on the ground 
toutside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the 
ttire marks.

tAfter a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose, 
tplaces it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see 
tthat the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the 
troad markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a 
tcar had been parked here.

tAfter a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it 
toff, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away 
tfrom the spot, past the office, heading for the path that 
tleads to the house. He goes up the path, pauses at the steps 
tof the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up 
tthe steps and into the house. CAMERA FOLLOWS him in, PAUSES 
tas he pauses at the foot of the stairs. Norman goes up the 
tstairs.

tOn the landing he stops. The door to his mother's room is 
tclosed. Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained 
tdress and a pair of elderly-woman's shoes. From an EXTREMELY 
tHIGH ANGLE, we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up 
tthe stained dress and shoes.

tHe rolls the shoes into the dress, tucks the small, neat 
tbundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading 
tfor the basement.

<b>tEXT. A LONG SHOT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)
</b>
tIt stands silhouetted against the sky. There is a long wait. 
tThen, slowly, a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney.

<b>ttttttt FADE OUT:
</b>
<b>ttttttt FADE IN
</b>
<b>tINT. BACK ROOM OF SAM'S HARDWARE STORE IN FAIRVALE - (DAY)
</b>
tSam is seated at his desk, writing a letter. Sequence

tbegins with CAMERA IN CLOSE, over Sam's shoulder, and we can 
tread as mush as he has written of the letter. The letterhead 
treads "Sam Loomis - Hardware," and the letter reads: "Dearest 
tright-as-always Mary: I'm sitting in this tiny back room 
twhich isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks 
tbig enough for both of us. So what if we're poor and cramped 
tand miserable, at least we'll be happy! If you haven't come 
tto your senses, and still want to...

tCAMERA begins PULLING AWAY as Sam turns the sheet of paper 
tover, continues backing away out of the small back room and 
theads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk, 
tBOB SUMMERFIELD, Sam's assistant, standing behind the counter, 
ta look of handsome patience on his face. He is waiting on a 
tmeticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and 
texamining a large can of insecticide. As CAMERA PASSES:

<b>ttttWOMAN CUSTOMER
</b>tt...They tell you what its ingredients 
ttare and how it's guaranteed to 
ttexterminate any insect in the world, 
ttbut they do not tell you whether or 
ttnot it's painless. And I say insect 
ttor man, death should always be 
ttpainless.

tCAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware 
tstore and we now see a girl standing just inside the door. 
tShe is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a 
tlook of purposefulness. She carries a handbag and a small 
tovernight case. She is Mary's sister, LILA CRANE.

tBob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her, 
tgives her an I'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod.

tLila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her 
teyes off Bob. As she approaches, she asks quietly:

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttSam?

<b>ttttSUMMERFIELD
</b>ttYou want to see Sam?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttSam Loomis.

<b>ttttSUMMERFIELD
</b>ttt(yelling toward back 
tttroom)
ttSam! Lady wants to see you!

tLila looks to the back room. The woman customer goes on 
tworriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can. 
tSam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at Lila a 
tmoment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he 
tdoes not know her. Lila studies him with a quiet, worried 
texpression.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYes?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttMay I talk to you?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(a bit mystified)
ttSure...

tLila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts 
ttoward the front of the store. Sam holds a moment, then 
tfollows. As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him 
tintently as she says:

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI'm Mary's sister.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttLila.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(quickly)
ttIs Mary here?

tSam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile 
texpression on Lila's face. He studies her for a quiet moment. 
tBehind them is a display of various size carving knives.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttIs something wrong?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI want to know if my sister is here.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHere?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWith you.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhere?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI don't know where. In your store, 
ttsomewhere in your town... anywhere.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhat's the matter?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttDon't you know?

tAs Sam is about to speak, the Woman Customer comes sailing 
tpast, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile.

<b>ttttWOMAN CUSTOMER
</b>ttAll I can do is hope if it isn't 
ttpainless, it's quick!

tShe speaks "quick" with a kind of delicious bite, nods 
thappily, goes on out of the store. Sam is now staring 
tapprehensively at Lila.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhat should I know?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttTo begin with, where Mary is. Do 
ttyou?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNo. I take it you don't either?
ttt(As Lila shakes her 
ttthead)
ttHow long?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttLast Friday. She left work, and 
tthome... I was in Tucson over the 
ttweekend... I haven't heard from her, 
ttnot even a phone call.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttAnd you thought she'd come up here, 
ttto me? If she had, what reason would 
ttshe have for not calling you?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttA good reason, I suppose.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(Slightly exasperated)
ttWell what do you think, we eloped or 
ttsomething? Or we're living in sin 
ttand...

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttMr. Loomis, you're so busy being 
ttdefensive that you haven't even 
ttreacted to the most serious fact of 
ttall. Mary is missing.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI was getting to that!

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWhat do you know about it?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNothing! You're putting me on the

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttLook, if you two are in this thing 
tttogether, I don't care, it's none of

ttMary. I want her to tell me she's 
ttall right and it's none of my 
ttbusiness. Then I'll go back to Phoenix 
ttand...

tShe stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes 
tbeginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a 
tmoment, then turns and calls:

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttBob? Run out and get yourself some 
ttlunch.

<b>ttttSUMMERFIELD
</b>ttIt's okay, Sam, I brought it with 
ttme.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttRun out and eat it.

tBob gets the message, goes out through the back way.

tSam goes closer to Lila, speaks with soft seriousness.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhat thing?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhat thing could we be in together?

ttI hate tears.

</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWell why didn't she come to me...

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttNot that kind...
ttt(Almost a smile)
ttYou men and your egos.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(Seriously)
ttNever mind my ego. Let's talk about 
ttMary.

tTheir attention is distracted by a man who has strolled 
tquietly into the room. He ignores them, walks past them, 
tgoes behind the counter, takes down a sign reading "CLOSED 
tFOR LUNCH," walks back to the door, closes door, hangs the 
tsign across the door window, locks the door, turns to Sam 
tand Lila, folds his arms, smiles a particularly unfriendly 
tsmile.

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttLet's all talk about Mary.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWho are you, friend?

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttMilt Arbogast, Private Investigator.

ttWhere is she, Miss Crane?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI don't know.

</b>ttWouldn't have been able to tail you 
ttif you did.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhat's your interest?

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttMoney.

tThere is a moment's silence and then, unable to tolerate the 
tsudden frightening happenings, Sam explodes.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttSomebody better tell me what's going 
tton and tell me fast! I can take so 
ttmuch and then...

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttt(Interrupting calmly)
ttYour girl friend stole forty thousand

tSam looks at Arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks 
tone of those seemingly ridiculous questions.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttt(An almost amused 
tttsmile)
ttMust've needed it.

</b>ttShe was supposed to bank it, on

tAnd no one has seen her since.

</b>ttt(Looking at Sam)
ttSomeone has seen her. Someone always

ttdollars.
ttt(To Sam)
ttShe is your girl friend, isn't she?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttSam, they don't want to prosecute,

</b>ttt(Correcting with 
tttCassidy's word)
ttCasharoonie!

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttSam, if she's here...

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttShe isn't!

tA real look of anguish comes into Lila's face. And Arbogast 
tstudies it, then speaks.

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttYou came up here on a hunch, Miss 
ttCrane? Nothing more? No phone call... 
ttfrom him, or from your sister herself?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(wearily)
ttNot even a hunch. Just hope.

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttWith a little checking, I could get 
ttto believe you.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(anxiously)
ttI don't care if you do or... I want 
ttto see Mary... before she gets in 
ttany deeper...

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttDid you check in Phoenix...

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttShe was seen leaving town in her

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(after a moment)
ttI don't believe it.
ttt(to Lila, slowly)
ttDo you?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(a thoughtful pause)
ttYes... I just... did. The moment 
ttthey told me...

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou might have doubted for say five 
ttminutes or so, Sister.

tLila turns from Sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face. 
tArbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically.

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttWe're always quickest to doubt people 
ttwho have a record for being honest.  
ttI think she's here, Miss Crane. Where

tttencouragingly)
ttShe won't be back there among the

ttthis town... somewhere. I'll find 
tther.

tHe nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to 
tthe counter, opens door, goes out into the street.

tAfter a quiet moment:

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI just listened... and believed 
tteverything they told me. 'She stole 
ttthe money.' 'We don't want to get

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttIt was her boss' idea not to report

tWe now see Norman. He has brought out an old rocking chair 
tand has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched 
tin it. And he is darning one of his own socks. CAMERA HOLDS. 
tBeyond the porch, and Norman, we see the old house and can 
tbarely make out, in the twilight dimness, the figure of his 
tmother seated at the window. Here, too, there is that quality 
tof quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding.

tNow Norman looks up at the SOUND of the approaching car.

tAnd continues looking as the car comes to a stop and Arbogast 
tgets out. Arbogast gives the place a quick once-over, gazes 
tat Norman, starts forward. In his steps and manner there is 
tthat bored, routine-logged quality of a man who has seen too 
tmany motels and asked question of too many hotel managers 
tover too short a period of time.

tNorman rises as Arbogast comes forward.

tNorman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in.

tNorman follows.

</b>ttI'm not the police.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttOh.

tHe waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out 
tsheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to Arbogast.

tArbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he 
tcrosses to Norman.

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttWe have reason to believe she came

tNorman glances, briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillow

</b>ttNo. At least I don't recall.

tttwith a pleasant smile)

tHe goes to the wall, flips a light switch.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttThe vacancy sign. Just in case.

tWe had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't

</b>ttNow there's a couple even remarking

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttt(A pause, a study)
ttMaybe she even signed the register... 
ttbecause habits die hard. Let's check 
ttit, huh?

tNorman says nothing. Arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the 
tregistry book around, flips back a page or two.

tNorman simply stares at the man. Arbogast hums faintly, 
tpleasantly, as he examines the pages. Then:

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttYes sir! Marie Samuels.  Interesting 
ttalias.

tHe takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside 
tthe signature in the registry book, all the while nodding 
tand smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as 
thappy as it is making him.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttI didn't lie to you. I just have

tArbogast has reached him, the picture extended. Norman looks 
tdutifully at it.

</b>ttIt was raining and her hair didn't

</b>ttTell me all about her.

</b>ttVery early. Dawn.

</b>ttNo! Of all...

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttHow do you know she didn't make a

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttShe was tired. She said she had a

ttmorning... Yes, now I'm remembering 
ttvery clearly because I'm picturing. 
ttWhen you make a picture of the moment 
ttin your mind, you can remember every

ttno she was standing up, with some 
ttsandwich still in her hand, and she 
ttsaid she had to drive a long way.

</b>ttBack where?

</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttYou said she was sitting "back there,"

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttOh. My private parlor. She had an 
ttawful hunger... so I made her some 
ttsupper. And then she went to bed and 
ttleft in the morning. I didn't even 
ttsee her leave.

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttHow did she pay you?

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttARBOGAST
</b>ttCash or check? For the cabin...

tHe starts out. Arbogast pauses, momentarily confused by the 
tyoung man's openness.

tNorman walks down the porch, hesitates before Cabin One, 
twalks on a bit toward Cabin Two, stops, turns to see if 
tArbogast is following. Arbogast has come out onto the porch, 
tbut is not following. He has walked to the opposite end of 
tthe porch and is standing at its edge, looking up at the old 
thouse. The upstairs window is in darkness. The neon of the 
tVacancy and Motel signs splash strange light over the scene.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttChange your mind?

tArbogast does not reply. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts 
tto Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful.

</b>ttI guess I've got one of those faces 
ttyou can't help believing.

</b>ttI live there. Alone.

</b>ttMy mother.

tArbogast turns, gazes seriously at him.

</b>ttShe's... ill. Confined to her room. 
ttIt's practically living alone.

</b>ttt(after a pause)
ttIf this girl Mary Crane were here,

</b>ttOf course not.

</b>ttNow, look...!

</b>ttOr if she had you say... gallantly

</b>ttI'm not a fool! And I'm not capable

ttThat's all right. maybe she could

ttShe didn't fool my mother.

</b>ttNo. I told you, she's confined...

</b>ttSick old women are sharp. Come on, I

ttMight save me a lot of leg-work if I

ttI'd need a warrant for that, won't 
<b>ttI?
</b>
tNorman does not respond. Arbogast gets in his car, starts 
tthe motor. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own 
tface showing apprehension. Arbogast backs the car around 
tvery slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the 
tlighted window of Cabin Two. As he turns the car out, his 
theadlights light up the porch.

tNorman stands, watching him drive away.

tArbogast gets to the phone booth, enters. CAMERA STARTS

tA distant view of the House and Motel. There is a light on 
tin the house. There is also a light on in Norman's office. 
tWe see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch 
ttoward the distant cabins. He carries sheets on his arm. He 
tgoes into the last cabin and switches the light on. Into the 
tforeground the hood of the white Ford enters the scene and 
tstops. Arbogast gets out. He goes over to the Motel office.

tArbogast looks around the empty office and calls.

tHe goes over to the door to the parlor and enters. He looks 
taround the bird-ridden room. He stops short as he sees:

tCAMERA HOLDS as Arbogast goes up onto the porch. The house 
tis dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill 
tof light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs 
thall. Arbogast goes to the living room window, looks in, 
tsees only darkness. Then he goes to the door, listens for 
talong moment, hears nothing.

tVery slowly, almost painfully, he turns the knob of the door 
tand pushes gently with his arm and shoulder. The door begins 
tto open. He allows it to open just enough for him to slip 
tthrough and into the foyer.

tArbogast gradually eases the door closed, stands against it, 
twaiting. He looks up in the direction of the light, sees no 
tone. The door at the head of the stairs is closed. Arbogast 
tlistens, holds his breath, hears what could be human sounds 
tcoming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the 
tsounds of an old house after sunset. After a careful wait, 
the crosses to the stairs, starts up, slowly, guardedly, 
tplacing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks 
tor groans before placing his full weight on it. CAMERA 
tFOLLOWS, remaining on floor level but TRAVELLING ALONG the

tAs Arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens and the mother 
tsteps out, her hand raises high, the blade of an enormous 
tknife flashing.

<b>tC.U. - A BIG HEAD OF AN ASTONISHED ARBOGAST

tThe knife slashes across his cheek and neck. Blood spurts. 
tThe sudden attack throws him off balance. He stumbles back 
tand staggers down the whole of the staircase. He frantically 
tgropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the 
tstairs. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him all the way. A wicked knife 
tkeeps thrusting itself into the foreground. As he collapses 
tat the bottom, the black head and shoulders of Mrs. Bates 
tplunges into the foreground as the CAMERA MOVES IN to contain 
tthe raising and descending murder weapon.

</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThat wouldn't be a wise thing to do.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttPatience doesn't run in our family.
ttSam, I'm going out there!

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttArbogast said...

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttAn hour! Or less!

tSam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real 
tanxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttGot the number of the motel out on 
ttthe old highway? Bates, I think.
ttt(waits)

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttSam! Why call when we can go?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttAnd maybe pass Arbogast on the road?
ttt(into phone)
ttThanks.

tHe presses down the receiver, releases it, dials Bates'

tMotel. The faint other-end ringing tones can be heard, 
trepeatedly, annoyingly. He waits.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(to Lila)
ttProbably on his way back right now.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttSam, I'm going.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(hangs up and picks 
tttup his jacket)
ttYou'll never find it.

tHe starts for the door. Lila follows after him into the store.

<b>tINT. STORE
</b>
tHe pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttStay here.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWhy can't I go out there with you?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(looks at her)
ttI don't know...
ttt(he collects himself)
ttOne of us has to be here in case 
ttArbogast's on the way.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(nervously)
ttJust wait here?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(a warm smile)
ttContemplate your... panic button.

tHe hurries down to the street door and out. CAMERA HOLDS on 
tLila as she stares after Sam. As she stands alone in the 
tdarkened store, all the hardware seems to take on sinister 
tshapes.

<b>tC.U.
</b>
tAmong some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls 
tonto the floor.

<b>tMEDIUM SHOT
</b>
tLila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in 
tits place. She turns and again looks to the deserted street 
twith a touch of anxiety. She gives a slight unconscious 
tshiver.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)
</b>
tTall and lonely still against the moonlight, the figure of 
tNorman, silhouetted. He doesn't move, merely stands there at 
tthe edge of the swamp, staring down at the now calm and quiet 
tface of it.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)
</b>
tAll light are out, except the light in Norman's mother's 
troom. And her figure can be seen sitting in the window, 
trelaxed in a high-back chair, her face turned into the room.  
tAfter a second, we hear the SOUND OF A MOTOR, and then Sam's 
tsmall pick-up truck swings into the driveway.

tSam stops the motor, automatically switches off headlights, 
tpauses as he observes the silence and darkness of the area. 
tThen he hops out of the cab, goes quickly to the office, 
tknocks on the door. As he waits for a response, he looks 
tdown the long porch, studies the darkened cabins, knocks 
tagain, louder, looks in the other direction and sees the 
thouse and the figure at the one lit window. He stares a moment 
tthen calls loudly:

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttArbogast?

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE SWAMP
</b>
tThe silhouette of Norman. He is still. Over shot, very dimly, 
tcomes the SOUND OF SAM'S VOICE, calling again for Arbogast.

tNorman turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile, 
this chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in 
tthe direction of the house. There is silence for a moment, 
tand then again the SOUND of Sam POUNDING at the door.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)
</b>
tThe store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room 
tspilling in.

<b>tL.S.
</b>
tWith CAMERA placed with its back to the street door, we can 
tsee the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in 
tthe back room beyond. There is a SOUND of a car pulling up. 
tThe tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back 
troom down the aisle of hardware and comes into a BIG HEAD. 
tWe see Lila's desperate anxious look.

<b>tMEDIUM SHOT
</b>
tFrom her viewpoint we see Sam alighting from his truck and 
tcoming toward the door of the store. He enters. He and Lila 
texchange quiet glances.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHe didn't come back here?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(worriedly)
ttSam.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNo Arbogast. No Bates. And only the 
ttold lady at home...
ttt(frowning)
ttA sick old lady unable to answer the 
ttdoor... or unwilling.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWhere could he have gone?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttMaybe he got some definite lead.
ttMaybe he went right on...

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWithout calling me?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttIn a hurry.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttSam, he called me when he had nothing 
ttdefinite, nothing but a dissatisfied 
ttfeeling. Don't you think he'd have 
ttcalled if he had anything...

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttYes. I think he would have.

tLila goes quiet. Sam starts toward the back room, pauses at 
tthe doorway, turns. Lila has remained by the door, looking 
tout at the street. She feels his pause, turns, and for a 
tmoment they share at each other across the darkened room.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttLet's go see Al Chambers.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWho's he?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHe's the Deputy Sheriff around here.

tAs he starts forward.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. STREET THE SHERIFF LIVES ON - (NIGHT)
</b>
tA dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses 
tdim in the moonlight. Sam's pick-up truck comes down the 
tstreet, pulls up before the house of Sheriff Chambers. CAMERA 
tMOVES IN on Sam and Lila as they remain for a moment in the 
ttruck's cab, staring quietly at the sleeping house.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttOur Deputy sleeps.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWell?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNothing.  Just... all the lights 
ttout... must be asleep.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(a small exasperation)
ttDoes that mean we can't...

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNo. I'm just procrastinating.  People 
tthate when the doorbell rings in the 
ttmiddle of the night.
ttt(gives up, starts out)
ttCome on.

tHe gets out of cab, goes around to help Lila. She is already 
tout. CAMERA FOLLOWS them up the small path to the front door. 
tSam presses the bell button. Both he and Lila are almost 
tknocked over by the shocking, clanging, ear-splitting BLAST 
tOF THE BELL within the house, a ring which sounds more like 
ta fire alarm than a doorbell.

tHe tries to smile, fails. Lila doesn't even try. The 
tdownstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is 
tunhesitatingly opened by MRS. CHAMBERS, a small, lively stick 
tof a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of 
thospitality.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttOh?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttSorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering 
ttyou...

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttYou didn't!
ttt(a cross look up at 
tttthe bell)
ttIt's tinkerbell.
ttt(a quick smile at 
tttLila)
ttAl wants to be sure he'll hear it if 
ttanyone rings it in the middle of the 
ttnight.
ttt(to Sam)
ttWell come on in, at least!

tAs she opens the door wide,

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL OF SHERIFF'S HOUSE - (NIGHT)
</b>
tFat roses splatter the wallpaper. The stairs are carpeted. 
tThe lighting is bright.

tThere is a perfectly fitting wall phone by the parlor arch. 
tMrs. Chambers goes to the stairway, yells up.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttAlbert!
ttt(a tiny wait, a smile 
tttas Sam and Lila enter)
ttAl Chambers!

tSam is about to close the door behind him. Mrs. Chambers 
tmotions for him not to, scurries across the hall, leans 
toutside, presses the doorbell. The RING within the house is 
teven more shattering. She closes the door, starts to the 
tstairway, pauses as the SOUNDS of movement above COME OVER 
<b>tSHOT.
</b>
<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttCustomers!

tSHERIFF CHAMBERS comes down the stairs, in a bathrobe which 
tmatches his wife's. He is a tall, narrow man with a face 
toriginally destined for Mount Rushmore. He nods at Sam, looks 
tat him with wide-awake eyes and a no-nonsense concern.  

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWe have a problem.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttt(to Lila)
ttLet's go out back and have some coca 
ttwhile the men are talking.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttNo, thank you. It's my problem, too.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI don't know where to start...
ttt(a look at Lila)
ttExcept at the beginning.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(to Sheriff)
ttThis is Lila Crane, from Phoenix.
ttShe's been here for a few days, 
ttlooking for her sister. There's a 
ttprivate detective helping... and, 
ttwell, we got a call tonight, from 
ttthis detective, saying he'd traced 
ttMary...

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttMary is Lila's sister?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYes. He traced her to that motel, 
ttout on the old highway...

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttt(to the Sheriff)
ttBates' Motel.
ttt(to Lila)
ttHe has a mind like a mechanical brain 
ttand the more information you feed 
ttit... Go on, Sam.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHe traced her there and called us to 
ttsay he was going to question Mrs. 
ttBates...

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttt(a pleasant shock)
ttNorman took a wife?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNo. An old woman, his mother.
ttt(to Sheriff, quickly)
ttThat was early this evening. And we 
tthaven't seen or heard from him since.  
ttI went out to the motel, just got 
ttback. No one was in the office, and...

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(interrupting, 
tttanxiously)
ttWill you help us? I think something's 
ttwrong out there!

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttt(after a considerate 
tttpause)
ttNow. Your sister is missing how long?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttShe left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. 
ttAnd no trace until...

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttHow'd you and this detective come to 
tttrace her to Fairvale?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThey thought she'd be coming to me.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttLeft Phoenix under her own steam?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttt(a pause)
ttShe ain't missing so much as she's 
ttrun away.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttFrom what?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(a look at sam, then:)
ttShe stole some money.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttA lot?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttForty thousand dollars.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttAnd the police haven't been able 
ttto...

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttEveryone concerned thought... if 
ttthey could get her to give back the 
ttmoney... they could avoid involving 
tther with the police.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttExplains the private detective. He 
tttraced her to the Bates place.  What'd 
tthe exactly say when he called you?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttMary had been there, one night, and 
tthad left.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttWith the forty thousand dollars?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttHe didn't mention the money.
ttt(anxiously)
ttWhat he said on the phone isn't 
ttimportant, is it?  He was supposed 
ttto come back after he spoke to the 
ttmother, and he didn't! That's what I 
ttwant you to do something about!

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttLike what?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttGo out there! Find somebody, ask 
ttsome questions!
ttt(a pause)
ttI'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to 
ttyou. I keep thinking... something's 
ttwrong. I have to know what!

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttI think something's wrong, too, Miss. 
ttBut not the same thing. I think your 
ttprivate detective is what's wrong.
ttt(As Lila is about to 
tttobject)
ttI think he got himself a hot lead as 
ttto where your sister was going... 
ttprobably from Norman Bates...  and 
ttcalled you to keep you still while 
tthe took off after her and the money.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttHe said he was dissatisfied... and 
ttwas going back.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttt(to Sheriff)
ttWhy don't you call Norman and let 
tthim say just what happened, if he 
ttgive the man a hot lead and he did 
ttjust scooted off... it'll make the 
ttgirl feel better, Albert.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttAt this hour?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHe was out when I was there. If he's 
ttback he probably isn't even in bed 
ttyet.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttHe wasn't out when you were there.  
ttHe just wasn't answering the door in 
ttthe dead of night... like some people 
ttdo. This fellow lives like a hermit...

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttRecluse. Kinder word.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttt(to Sam)
ttYou must remember that bad business 
ttout there. About ten years ago...

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI've only been here five. Right now 
ttit feels like ten, but...

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttAll right! Then call! At least, call!

tMrs. Chambers goes to phone, dials operator.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttFlorrie, the Sheriff wants you to 
ttconnect him with the Bates Motel.

tShe hands the receiver to the Sheriff. He takes it, 
treluctantly, listens to the dim sound of RINGING on the other 
tend. After a moment:

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttNorman? Sheriff Chambers.
ttt(listens)
ttBeen just fine, thanks. Listen, we 
ttgot some worries here. Did you have 
tta man stop out there tonight...
ttt(listens)
ttWell, this one wouldn't be a customer, 
ttanyway. A private detective, name 
ttof...

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttArbogast.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttArbogast.
ttt(listens)
ttAnd after he left?
ttt(listens)
ttNo, it's okay, Norman. How's it been 
ttgoing out there?
ttt(listens)
ttWell, I think you oughta unload that 
ttplace and open up closer in to the

ttbut...

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttPlease!

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttSorry I got you up, boy. Go back to 
ttsleep. Yeah, be glad to.
ttt(hangs up, turns to 
tttMrs. Chambers)
ttSaid to give you his regards.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(faint irony)
ttWas that all?

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttThis detective was out there and 
ttNorman told him about the girl and 
ttthe detective thanked him and went 
ttaway.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttAnd he didn't go back? Didn't see 
ttthe mother?

tThe Sheriff looks long at Lila, shakes his head 
tsympathetically.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttYou should've called in the police 
ttthe second you found your sister has 
ttskipped. You go starting private 
ttinvestigations, using people you 
ttdon't even know...

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWhat difference does that...

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttYour Detective told you a nakedfaced 
ttlie.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttBarefaced.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttHe told you he wasn't coming right 
ttback cause he wanted to question 
ttNorman Bates' mother, right?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttt(a pause, then calmly)
ttNorman Bates' mother has been dead 
ttand buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for 
ttthe last ten years!

tThere is a long silence. Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttI helped Norman pick out the dress 
ttshe was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttIt ain't only local history, Sam, 
ttit's the only murder-and-suicide 
ttcase in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs.
ttBates poisoned this guy she was... 
ttinvolved with, when she found out he 
ttwas married, then took a helping of 
ttthe same stuff herself.  Strychnine. 
ttUgly way to die.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttNorman found them dead together.  In 
ttbed.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou mean that old woman I saw sittin' 
ttin the window wasn't Norman Bates' 
ttmother?

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttt(hopefully, happily)
ttMaybe you saw Mary!

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI'd know the difference between Mary 
ttand an old woman.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttNow wait a minute, Sam. You sure you 
ttsaw an old woman?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYes! In the house behind the motel. 
ttI pounded and called but she... just 
ttignored me.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttAnd you want to tell me you saw Norman 
ttBates' mother.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttIt must've been. Arbogast said so, 
tttoo... and he said the young man 
ttwouldn't let him see her because she 
ttwas ill!

tThe Sheriff stares at both of them, and when he finally speaks 
tthere is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttWell, if the woman up there is Mrs.
ttBates... who's that woman buried out 
ttat Greenlawn Cemetery?

<b>ttttttQUICK CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. NORMAN'S PARLOR BEHIND OFFICE - (NIGHT)
</b>
tNorman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to 
thim, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to 
tmove his hand after hanging up. He is staring at the shrike-
tlike bird which is perched on the lamp shade. Decision and 
tresolution are beginning to show in his face. Suddenly he 
trises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off 
tthe lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking 
tthe bird off the shade.

tHe watches it fall, does not try to catch it. It hits the 
tfloor with a thud and sawdust spills out. He stares sadly at 
tit, for a moment, then tends down, scoops up the sawdust, 
ttries to press it into the split seam, picks up the bird, 
tputs it in a drawer. Then he puts out the lamp, goes out, 
tcrosses the darkened office and goes outside.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)
</b>
tNorman comes off the porch, walks to the path and directly 
tup to the house, opens the door and goes in.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRWAY - (NIGHT)
</b>
<b>tSHOOTING UP THE STAIRS
</b>
tNorman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door, 
tthen opens it and goes in, leaving the door open.

tFor a moment we hear only Norman's low, quiet voice, his 
twords indistinguishable. Then we hear the cold shot of his 
tmother's derisive laughter.

<b>ttttMOTHER'S VOICE
</b>ttI am sorry, boy, but you do manage 
ttto look ludicrous when you give me 
ttorders!

<b>ttttNORMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttPlease, mother...

<b>ttttMOTHER'S VOICE
</b>ttt(Sharp, laughter all 
tttgone)
ttNo! I will not hide in the fruit 
ttcellar!
ttt(A shrill laugh)
ttThink I'm fruity, huh?
ttt(Hard, cold again)
ttI'm staying right here!  This is my 
ttroom and no one will drag me out of 
ttit... least of all my big bold son!

<b>ttttNORMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttt(Rising now, anxiously)
ttThey'll come now, Mother. He came 
ttafter the girl and now someone will 
ttcome after him! How long do you think 
ttyou can go on... Mother, please, 
ttjust for a few days, just so they 
ttwon't find you!

<b>ttttMOTHER'S VOICE
</b>ttt(Mimicking)
ttJust for a few days...
ttt(Furious)
ttIn that dank fruit cellar? No!  You 
tthid me there once, boy, and you won't 
ttdo it again! Not ever again!  Now 
ttget out!
ttt(A pause, quiet)
ttI told you to get out, boy!
ttt(A longer pause)
ttNorman! What do you think you're 
ttgoing to do? Don't you touch me!
ttDon't! Norman!
ttt(A pause, then 
tttcajolingly)
ttAll right, son, put me down and I'll 
ttgo. I'll go on my own two feet. I 
ttcan go on my own two feet, can't I?

tDuring all this the CAMERA has been slowly creeping up the 
tstairs. It does not stop at the top however, but continues 
ton the same high angle that we had in Scene 57.

tShe starts to laugh, a terrible sound like an obscene melody.

<b>ttttNORMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttI'll carry you, mother.

tNorman comes out of the room, his mother held in his arms, 
ther head leaning against his shoulder. He carries her down 
tthe stairs, along the lower landing to the cellar stairs, 
tand then down those stairs to the basement.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. FAIRVALE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - (MORNING)
</b>
tAn overcast morning, but a sunny-faced crowd. The service is 
tjust over, there is contentment, and peace, and just a little 
tI-went-to-church-smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as 
tthey come out of the chapel, and spread their separate ways 
taway.

tAmongst the crowd, waiting and searching the faces, are Sam 
tand Lila. In their expressions there is no peace, no 
tcontentment. CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE. They are not speaking. 
tLila looks as if she has had no sleep.

tSuddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward 
tthe church.

tCAMERA MOVES WITH THEM, stops as they approach Sheriff and 
tMrs. Chambers. The Sheriff stares rather sympathetically at 
tLila. Mrs. Chambers smiles nicely.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWe thought, if you didn't mind, we'd 
ttgo out to the motel with you.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttHe's already been.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttWent out before service.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttHave you two had breakfast?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(To Sheriff, not a

ttYou didn't find anything.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttNothing. Here, let's clear the path.

tHe moves away and the others follow. CAMERA PANS them to the 
tcurb.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(Interrupting)
ttDid he say anything about my sister?

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttJust what he told your detective.

tShe used a fake name, saw the register myself. Saw the whole 
tplace, as a matter of fact. That boy is alone there.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttNo mother.

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttYou must've seen an illusion, Sam.
ttNow, I know you're not the seeing-
ttillusion type... But no woman was 
ttillusion there and I don't believe 
ttin ghosts, so there it is!

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI still feel...

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttCan see you do. Sorry I couldn't 
ttmake you feel better. You want to 
ttcome to my office this afternoon and 
ttreport a missing person... And the

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAMBERS
</b>ttIt's Sunday. Come over and do the 
ttreporting at the house, 'round dinner 
tttime. Make it nicer. You too, Sam.

tShe smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss 
tthis year's charity fandango, takes the

tSheriff's arm, starts away. The Sheriff nods as he goes.

tSam and Lila are alone now, at the curb, before the deserted 
tchapel. For a long moment they just stand there, their faces 
tas gray and overcast as the sky.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttMaybe I am the seeing-illusions type.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttYou're not.

tSam takes her arm, starts walking her up the street toward 
tthe spot where his pick-up truck is parked.

tCAMERA FOLLOWS them.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWant me to drop you at the hotel?  
ttOr you want to come over to the store?

tLila does not answer. They reach the truck. Lila looks 
tdirectly at Sam as he helps her into the cab.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI won't feel satisfied unless I got

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

</b>
tFor a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if 
tthere were other cars on it, Lila staring at nothing in 
tparticular, except perhaps her own inner fear.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttOf course we will.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttAlive.

tSam looks as if he'd like to say something humorous, something 
tto cheer her. He cannot. He remains silent.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWe lived together all our lives.

tWhen we woke up one morning and found ourselves orphans, 
tMary quit college and got a job, so I could go to college.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhere'd you go to college?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI didn't. I got a job, too.
ttt(A pause)
ttI wonder if that hurt her, my not 
ttletting her sacrifice for me?  Some 
ttpeople are so willing to suffer for 
ttyou that they suffer more if you 
ttdon't let them.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(Almost to himself)
ttShe was willing to lick the stamps.

tLila looks quizzically at him, is too concerned to pursue 
tit.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI wonder so many things about her 
ttnow.  Why she never told me about 
ttyou...  Funny, when you think there's 
ttan answer to everything, you think 
ttyou know all the answers.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWe were going to get married. Are 
ttgoing to get married!

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttDo you know how I found out about 
ttyou? I found one of your letters... 
ttit was a nice letter, Sam.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThis is the old highway.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI suppose... when you were able to 
ttmarry her she'd have presented you, 
ttall shiny and proper... she always 
tttried to be proper.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWatch your tenses.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttShe always tries to be proper.

tSam slows the truck to a stop, sighs, starts to light up a 
tcigarette. Lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttYou going to wait here for me?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI'm going with you. But we'd better 
ttdecide what we're going to say and 
ttdo when we walk in...

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWe're going to register. As man and 
ttwife. And get shown to a cabin... 
ttand then search every inch of that 
ttplace, inside and... outside.

</b>ttYou won't believe it...
ttt(Starts motor)
ttBut this will be the first time
ttI've ever pulled one of those man-

tAs truck starts to drive on,

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE BATES MOTEL AND HOUSE - (DAY)
</b>
tThe place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep 
tgray of the cloudy sky. We see Sam's truck turning into the 
tdriveway and pulling to a stop. After a moment, Sam and Lila 
tget out of the truck.

<b>tFRESH ANGLE
</b>
tClose on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the 
ttruck. The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in 
tb.g. of shot. Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment, then 
tturn and gaze up at the house. There is no figure in the 
twindow and the shade is drawn. Same goes to the office door, 
tpeers in, knocks, opens door, enters. Lila remains on the 
tdriveway, beside the truck.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM - (DAY)
</b>
tCLOSE ANGLE on Norman standing by the window. He has pulled 
tthe curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at 
tthe motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is 
tstanding by the truck and looking up at the house.  Norman 
tstudies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he 
tcloses the curtains, turns away.

tWe see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic 
tand his struggle to contain it. Then he goes away. CAMERA 
tremains on window, shooting out and down, and through the 
tfrail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel 
toffice and joins Lila.

<b>tEXT. MOTEL OFFICE - CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA
</b>
<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(Unconsciously 
tttwhispering)
ttI wonder where Norman Bates does his 
tthermiting?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttSomeone was at that window. I saw 
ttthe curtain move.

tSam takes Lila's arm.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttCome on.

tHe starts with her toward the path which leads to the old 
thouse. CAMERA PANS with them, and as they turn around the 
toffice corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward 
tthem. They pause and Norman pauses. He does not smile, nor 
tspeak. His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone; 
tcontainment and impassivity lie in their place.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(Cheerfully)
ttJust coming up to ring for you.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttt(Coming forward)
ttI suppose you want a cabin.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWe'd hoped to make it straight to 
ttSan Francisco, but we don't like the 
ttlook of that sky. Looks like a bad 
ttday coming... doesn't it.

tNorman walks past Sam, giving him the sort of quick, 
tdisapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying, 
tgoes onto the porch and into the office. Sam and Lila follow 
tNorman.

<b>tINT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
</b>
tNorman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to 
tcabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have 
tentered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttI'll take you to...

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttBetter sign in first, hasn't we?

tSam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttIt isn't necessary.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(Interrupting with a 
tttfriendly cheerfulness)
ttUh, uh! My boss is paying for this 
tttrip... ninety percent business... 
ttand he wants practically notarized 
ttreceipts. I better sign in and get a 
ttreceipt.

tNorman stares at Sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, call 
thim "liar." Instead he reaches under the desk counter, brings 
tout the registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the 
tbook as Sam signs in. Sam signs "Joe and Mrs. Johnson."  The 
tsignature and city of "Marie Samuels" and after it, the 
tnotation "Cabin One," can be clearly seen three registrations 
tabove Sam's.

tWhen Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman. 
tNorman does not take it, starts out from behind counter.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttI'll get your bags.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHaven't any.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttt(after a stare)
ttI'll show you the cabin.

tAs he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns, 
tlooks at him.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttFirst time I've seen it happen.
ttt(to Lila)
ttCheck in any place in this country 
ttwithout bags, and you have to pay in 
ttadvance.

tSam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his 
tpocket.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttTen dollars...

tNorman returns to Sam, takes the extended bill, is about to 
tstart out again.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThat receipt...?

tNorman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to 
tcabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under 
tcounter, starts to write. Lila steps up to the desk, picks 
tup the key, quickly, starts out.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttI'll start ahead.

tNorman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door.

<b>tEXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)
</b>
tLila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries 
tthe door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam 
tand Norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down 
tthe porch.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(To Norman, who is 
tttfollowing)
ttDon't bother yourself... we'll find 
ttit.

tHe goes on down the porch, doesn't even glance at cabin one, 
twalks quickly and catches up to Lila just as she reaches 
tcabin twelve. CAMERA REMAINS with Norman, who is standing by 
tthe office door, looking after Sam and Lila, his face alert 
tand no longer impassive. He waits a moment, after they have 
tclosed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck.  
tCAMERA MOVES with him. He studies the truck, then leans in 
tthrough the driver's window, twists the registration card 
taround, reads it.

tIt gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis.

tNorman comes back out of the window, glances once more toward 
tcabin twelve, then at the old house. His suspicions are 
tconfirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in his 
tface. He takes on a purposeful air, turns, strides up the 
tpath, up onto the porch of the house, opens the door, goes 
tin.

<b>tINT. CABIN TWELVE - (DAY)
</b>
tLila is at the cabin's rear window, looking out, straining 
tfor a glimpse of the old house, which cannot be seen from 
tthe window of this cabin.

tShe turns, frustrated, anxious. Sam is standing at the foot 
tof the bed, staring at the smooth coverlet, his brow creased 
tin a sadness.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWe should have asked for Cabin One... 
ttThe one Mary was in.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI'm glad we didn't.

tHe pulls his eyes from the bed, crosses to the desk, sits 
twearily, lights a cigarette. Lila watches him for a moment, 
tfeels a real compassion, goes to the bed, sits on its edge, 
tturns again and looks at Sam's back.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWe have to go into that cabin and 
ttsearch it, Sam... no matter what 
ttwe're afraid of finding and no matter 
tthow much it may hurt.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI know.
ttt(A pause)
ttDo you think if something happened, 
ttit happened there?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(A pause, then:)
ttSam, if you owned a useless business 
ttlike this motel... one you probably 
ttcouldn't even sell...  what would 
ttyou need to get away, to start a new 
ttbusiness, somewhere else?
ttt(As Sam studies her)
ttForty thousand dollars?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHow could we prove...
ttt(An almost hopeless 
tttlaugh)
ttWell, if he opens a new motel on the 
ttnew highway... say, a year from now...

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttThere must be some proof that exists 
ttright now! Something that proves he 
ttgot that money away from Mary... 
ttSome way!

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhat makes you sound so certain?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttArbogast! Sam, he liked me... or 
ttfelt sorry for me... and he was 
ttstarting to feel the same about you. 
ttI heard it when he called... in his 
ttvoice, a caring. He wouldn't have 
ttgone anywhere or done anything without 
tttelling us.  Unless he was stopped. 
ttAnd he was stopped, so he must have 
ttfound out something!

tSam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWe'll start with Cabin One.

tHe goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then, 
tback to Lila:

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttIf he sees us... we're just taking 
ttthe air.

tLila goes to the door. He holds it open and she goes out.

<b>tEXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)
</b>
tSam closes the door, joins Lila, takes her hand.

tTogether they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin 
tOne. CAMERA FOLLOWS. They pause before the door of Cabin 
tOne. Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on 
tto the office, opens the door, calls in:

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttBates?

tHe waits, there is no response. He goes in and in a moment 
tcomes back out, closes the door, goes to Lila.

tShe has already opened the door of Cabin One and has started 
tto enter.

<b>tINT. CABIN ONE - (DAY)
</b>
tThe blinds are closed and the room is almost night-dark.

tSam comes in after Lila, closes the door behind him.

tFor a moment they just gaze at the room, as if willing it to 
ttell them some satisfactory story.

tNeither speaks. Then, in dark silence, they begin to search, 
tgoing methodically and thoroughly through all drawers, the 
tcloset, the desk, searching under the bed and in dark corners, 
tnot knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to 
tfind some thing. Lila opens the bathroom door, looks in. The 
twindowless room is very dark. She switches on the light, 
tgoes in. Sam moves toward the bathroom, is about to follow 
ther in when he notices which room it is and automatically 
tcatches himself up, backs out.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttSorry.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttHospital clean.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttThe bathroom. Look at how clean it 
ttis. The one in our cabin is clean... 
ttbut this is clean!

tSam goes in, glances around, nods. Lila goes through the 
tmedicine cabinet, finds nothing but a glass and two tiny 
ttabs of soap. Sam leans against the door-jamb, looks at the 
ttub, the shower pipe above it. He continues to stare, more 
tinterested suddenly, as if bothered by some off-key evidence 
the can't put his finger on. Then he looks at the shower 
tcurtain rod.

tAnd realizes there is no shower curtain. He frowns, is about 
tto say something when Lila, who has been momentarily out of 
tshot, interrupts.

tSam turns, CAMERA TURNS, and we see Lila is standing above 
tthe toilet bowl, a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip 
tof her right index finger.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhat is it?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttIt didn't get washed down. It's 
ttfiguring... the kind you tear up and 
ttget rid of.
ttt(Extending her finger 
ttttoward Sam)
ttSome figure has been added to or 
ttsubtracted from... forty thousand.

tSam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it, 
ttakes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's 
tlicense shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet 
taway.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttThat's proof Mary was here!  It would 
ttbe too wild a coincidence for somebody

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(Reminding)
ttBates never denied Mary was here.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(Reminded)
ttYes.
ttt(A thought)
ttBut maybe this proves that Bates 
ttfound out about the money.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttDo we simply ask him where he's hidden 
ttit?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttSam, that old woman, whoever she is. 
ttI think she told Arbogast something! 
ttAnd I want her to tell us the same 
ttthing!

tShe starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm, 
tstops her.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou can't go up there.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttWhy not?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttBates.

troom, very slowly.

<b>ttttLILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttLet's find him. One of us can keep

</b>ttYou won't be able to hold him still 
ttif he doesn't want to be held. And I

tCAMERA HAS PANNED clear across to the opposite wall now, and 
tis moving up closer and closer to the tiny-flowered wall 
tpaper, finally closing in on one small rosebud.

<b>ttttLILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttI can handle a sick old woman.

tNow we see that the rosebud has been cut out, that this is 
tthe reverse side of the hole Norman peeped through to watch 
tMary. And we see the pupil of Norman's eye now.

<b>ttttSAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttAll right. I'll find Bates and keep

tThe eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before 
tthe hole is covered, on the other side, by the wall-hung 
tpainting.

ttCan you find your way back to town?
ttt(As Lila nods yes)
ttIf you do get anything, don't stop

tLila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first, 
topens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough 
tfor Lila and Himself to pass through.

<b>tEXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)

</b>
tCAMERA ANGLES to include Lila and her point of view.

tleads off the hallway, to the dining room on the right and 
tthe parlor on the left. Down at the end of the hall is the

tby the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps. She 
tsteps more carefully. CAMERA remains at foot of stair, TILTING 
tUP as Lila climbs. She pauses at the head of the stair. The 
tdoor on her right, which opens into the mother's room, is 
tclosed. To her left is another door, half-open. Directly 
tbefore her is a third door, closed. She holds a long moment, 
ttrying to picture in her mind which room would look out on 
tthe front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door, 
tthe one on her right. She goes to it, knocks lightly.

</b>ttMrs. Bates?

tThere is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open, 
tand we see Lila. She stands on the threshold, looking in at 
tthe room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her 
texpression indicating an impulse to close the door and go 
taway from this room forever.

tAfter a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind 
ther. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as 
tLila sees it.

tIt is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe, 
tan olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of 
tthe last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the 
tdressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a 
tgreat chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full-
tlength pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite 
tthe door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the 
twindow, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled 
twith ashes.

tAnd there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if 
teven though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long 
tvacated by some musty presence.

tLila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over 
tit, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on 
tit, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb-
tlike position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes 
tto the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and 
tjars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an 
topened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of 
thair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of 
therself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to 
tthe chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high 
twardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, 
thesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed 
tdresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters 
tand dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage-
ttype bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes.  
tAlong the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished 
tshoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once 
tagain over the whole room, starts out,

<b>tINT. NORMAN'S ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
</b>
tLila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick 
tdismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy 
tof childhood held beyond the point of decency.

tIt is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping 
tsilhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and 
tfat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far 
ttoo short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled 
tcovers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps.  
tNext to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top 
tthere are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an 
tash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's 
tshirt hangs on a child's clothes tree.

tAgainst one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled 
twith thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white 
tchest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record 
ton the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be 
tBeethoven's Eroica Symphony.

tLila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances 
tat the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase 
tand pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens 
tit. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust. 
tShe slams the book closed, drops it.

<b>tINT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
</b>
tNorman, behind the counter, has moved back against the wall. 
tSam is still on the other side of the counter, but is leaning 
tforward, his eyes hard on Norman's face.

tNorman's face is no longer expressionless. It has the stark, 
thigh sheen of a cornered animal.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(Pressing)
ttYou look frightened. Have I been 
ttsaying something frightening?

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttI don't know what you've been saying.

</b>ttI've been talking about your mother... 
ttabout your motel. How are you going 
ttto do it?

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttDo what?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttBuy a new one! In a new town!
ttWhere you won't have to hide your

</b>ttShut up!

</b>ttWhere will you get the money to do

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttLeave me alone!

<b>ttttSAM
</b>tt...Forty thousand dollars!

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttLeave me alone!

tHe is close to panic now. He turns, swiftly, dashes back 
tinto his private parlor. Sam goes quickly around the counter, 
tfollows.

<b>tINT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)
</b>
tNorman hears Sam following, wants to run, to never be reached 
tby this man. He crosses the small room, drawn to the rear 
twindow, as if he might fly through it. Sam enters, pauses.  
tNorman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away 
tas are the many still, stuffed birds. Sam registers a brief 
tflicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to 
tgaze at Norman, hard.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI bet your mother knows where the 
ttmoney is. And what you did to get 
ttit. And I think she'll tell us.

tSomething self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives 
tNorman a new, more terrified alarm. He turns his head, glances 
tout the window at the old house. He looks back at Sam and 
tthere is terror in his voice.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttWhere's that girl? The girl you came 
ttwith! Where is she?

tSam does not respond, smiles a half-smile, turns to examine 
ta stuffed owl. Norman looks back at the house.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttt(A horrible groan)
ttOh, God!

<b>tINT. UPSTAIRS HALL OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
</b>
tLila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming out 
tof Norman's room. She has left the light on. She pauses in 
tthe middle of the landing, looks at the closed door opposite 
tthe stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the 
tbathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the stairs.

<b>tINT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)
</b>
tSam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving. A 
tcandlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still rocking 
tas if just dropped. OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Norman's 
tfootsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimpse 
tof him going out into the office, almost at a run.

<b>tINT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
</b>
tLila is on the top step, looking down toward CAMERA.

tShe is listening, hoping to hear some human sound, some sound 
tshe might follow, pursue. She hears nothing. She starts down 
tthe stairs. Just below the halfway step, she looks at the 
tfront door, sees out through the door window:

<b>tLILA'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)
</b>
tNorman coming.

<b>tINT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
</b>
tFor a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, 
tcannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the 
tstairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction. The 
tSOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard. 
tLila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the 
tbasement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching 
tthere.

tNorman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens. 
tHe glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. He 
tseems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes 
tfrom his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time 
tstate. He crosses to the stairway, goes up.

tLila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to 
tthe SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followed 
tby the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an 
tupstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstairs 
tfor her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up the 
tsteps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is 
tcaught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pauses, 
tlooks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the 
tnot entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift moving 
tSOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs.

tLila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while 
tshe has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check 
tthat hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she 
tdesperately believes, there must lie some answer to what 
thappened to Mary. She turns and goes softly and quickly down 
tthe stairs.

<b>tINT. THE BASEMENT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
</b>
tLila reaches the bottom, stops, listens, hears the stairboards 
tcreaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them. She 
tturns, pulls open the fruit cellar door, looks in. The woman 
tis sitting in a comfortable chair, the back of the chair, 
tand the woman, turned to the door. Lila calls a harsh, 
tfrightened whisper.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttMrs. Bates...?

tLila goes into the room.

<b>tINT. THE FRUIT CELLAR
</b>
tLila goes to the chair, touches it. The touch disturbs the 
tfigure. It starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock-wise 
tmovement. Lila looks at it in horror. It is the body of a 
twoman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the 
tmouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile.  
tThe eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose 
thas collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are 
tsunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and 
tflaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed 
tdress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed.

tThe movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning 
tas if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually 
tgraceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene.

tLila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins 
tto scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream.

tAnd Lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more 
tdreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind 
ther.

<b>ttttNORMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttt(screaming)
ttAyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma 
ttBates!

tLila turns.

<b>tNORMAN
</b>
tHis face is contorted. He wears a wild wig, a mockery of a 
twoman's hair. He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is 
tsimilar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. His hand 
tis raised high, poised to strike at Lila. There is a long 
tbreadknife in it.

<b>tLILA
</b>
tClose on her face. She is dumb-struck. Her eyes are screaming.

<b>tBACK TO NORMAN
</b>
tAs he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in 
tfrom the doorway behind, grabs Norman's wrist. Sam comes 
tthrough the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling 
tback the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman, 
tfootball tackle style.

<b>tSERIES OF CUTS - THE FIGHT
</b>
tNorman and Sam, struggling. The wild fury in Norman's face, 
tthe mad noise of his screams and vile curses. The terrified, 
tfight-to-the-death look of Sam. The still, staring Lila.

<b>tMRS. BATES
</b>
tA close of her face, She appears to be watching and enjoying 
tthe fight. Over the shot, the SOUNDS of the struggle, the 
tscreams of Norman.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. COURTHOUSE AT READING - (NIGHT)
</b>
tThere are many people gathered about the steps, the curious 
tand the concerned and the morbid. At the curb, a couple of 
tnewspaper cars, two or three police cars, and a mobile unit 
ttruck from the local television outlet. There is noise, and 
tchattering as questions are asked and answers given, and the 
tsounds of traffic, and of the television equipment being 
tmoved into the courthouse, for on-the-scene reporting, and 
tthe stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back. 
tThe scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden 
tlight thrown on a fearful darkness.

<b>tCLOSER ANGLE ON STEPS OF COURTHOUSE
</b>
tA POLICEMAN trying to make way for the television men, 
tmuttering "keep back," etc., to the spectators. A TELEVISION 
tMAN, carrying a piece of equipment goes through door, and 
tCAMERA FOLLOWS him into the courthouse vestibule.

tHere, too, there is a crowd, composed of Policemen, Reporters, 
tTelevision Men. The Television Men we have been following 
tstops beside a Policeman.

<b>ttttTELEVISION MAN
</b>ttt(Indicating the front

ttYou think they'll take him out that

ttProbably have to.
ttt(A rueful smile)
ttBesides, the taxpayers hate it when 
ttsomething gets slipped out the back

tOver this exchange, the buzz of other voices, the movement 
tof men. CAMERA MOVES ON, down the corridor, gets to the door 
tof the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow 
twith a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out-
tfor coffee reaches this door. CAMERA HOLDS as the COFFEE BOY 
tpauses a moment, then goes into the room.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - (NIGHT)
</b>
tLila is seated in a chair, Sam standing close by. A bit apart 
tfrom them, we see Sheriff Chambers, in quiet conference with 
tthe CHIEF OF POLICE, the COUNTY SHERIFF, the DISTRICT 
<b>tATTORNEY.
</b>
tThe Coffee Boy stands in the doorway. Sam goes to him, takes 
ta container of coffee from the box, carries it to Lila, 
tchecking the notation on the lid as he goes.

</b>

</b>ttt(quietly)
ttIt's regular. Okay?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(ruefully)
ttI could stand something regular.

tSam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee. Sheriff 
tChambers ENTERS SHOT, gives Sam a container of coffee he has 
tbrought for him. Sam takes it, nods a thank you.

tFor a moment no one speaks. Lila looks badly shaken, Sam 
tdisheveled, but contained.

</b>ttYou two can go on home if you like.

tttat Lila)

ttWant to?

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttNo. I'm all right. I'll feel better 
ttwhen all this is explained... if it

tSam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers. Chambers shrugs 
tdoubtfully.

</b>ttIf anybody gets any answers, it'll 
ttbe the fellow talking to him now... 
ttthe Psychiatrist. Even I couldn't

ttt(to Lila)
ttYou warm enough, Miss?

tLila is about to answer, when she sees someone come into the 
troom and rises anxiously. Sam and Sheriff Chambers turn, 
tfollow her gaze.

<b>tINT. OFFICE OF CHIEF OF POLICE - FULL SHOT
</b>
tA young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into 
tthe room. He is DR. SIMON, the Psychiatrist.

tHe goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has 
tbeen placed, takes up a container.

<b>ttttDISTRICT ATTORNEY
</b>ttDid he talk to you?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttNo. I got the whole story... but not 
ttfrom Norman. I got it from... his

tEveryone gazes at him, mystified. He speaks as he removes 
tlid from coffee container.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttNorman Bates no longer exists. He 
ttonly half-existed to begin with...  
ttnow, the other half has taken over.  
ttProbably for all time.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(With difficulty)
ttDid he kill my sister?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttYes... and no.

</b>ttLook, if you're trying to lay a lot

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttYes. I'm sorry.
ttt(to Chambers)
ttThe Private Investigator, too. If

ttt(To the Chief of Police)
ttHave you any unsolved missing persons 
ttcases on your books?

<b>ttttCHIEF OF POLICE
</b>ttYes. Two.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttYoung girls?

<b>ttttCHIEF OF POLICE
</b>ttt(nods, astounded, 
tttthen:)
ttDid he confess to...

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttAs I said, the mother...
ttt(Pauses, goes on afresh)
ttTo understand it, as I understood it 
tthearing it from the mother...  That 
ttis, from the mother-half of Norman's 
ttmind, you have to go back ten years... 
ttto the time when Norman murdered his 
ttmother and her lover.
ttt(A pause, then as no 
tttone interrupts)
ttHe was already dangerously disturbed, 
tthad been ever since his father died. 
ttHis mother was a clinging, demanding 
ttwoman... and for years the two of 
ttthem lived as if there was no one 
ttelse in the world. Then she met a 
ttman and it seemed to Norman she "threw 
tthim over" for this man. That pushed 
tthim over the thin line... and he 
ttkilled them both. Matricide is 
ttprobably the most unbearable crime 
ttof all... and most unbearable to the 
ttson who commit it. So he had to erase 
ttthe crime, at least in his own mind.
ttt(A pause)
ttHe stole her corpse... and a weighted 
ttcoffin was buried. He hid the body 
ttin the fruit cellar, even "treated" 
ttit to keep it as well as it would 
ttkeep. And that still wasn't enough. 
ttShe was there, but she was a corpse.  
ttSo he began to think and speak for 
tther, gave her half his life, so to 
ttspeak. At times he could be both 
ttpersonalities, carry on 
ttconversations... at other times, the 
ttmother-half took over completely. He 
ttwas never all Norman, but he was 
ttoften only mother. And because he 
ttwas so pathologically jealous of 
tther, he assumed she was as jealous 
ttof him. Therefore, if he felt a strong 
ttattraction to any other woman, the 
ttmother side of him would go wild.
ttt(To Lila)
ttWhen Norman met your sister, he was 
tttouched by her... and aroused by 
tther. He wanted her. And this set off 
tthis "jealous mother" and...  "mother 
ttkilled the girl." After the murder, 
ttNorman returned as if from a deep 
ttsleep... and like a dutiful son, 
ttcovered up all traces of the crime 
tthe was convinced his mother had 
ttcommitted.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttWhy was he... dressed like that?

<b>ttttDISTRICT ATTORNEY
</b>ttHe's a transvestite!

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttNot exactly. A man who dresses in 
ttwoman's clothing in order to achieve 
tta sexual change... or satisfaction... 
ttis a transvestite.  But in Norman's 
ttcase, he was simply doing everything 
ttpossible to keep alive the illusion 
ttof his mother being alive. And 
ttwhenever reality came too close, 
ttwhen danger or desire threatened 
ttthat illusion, he'd dress up, even 
ttto a cheap wig he brought, and he'd 
ttwalk about the house, sit in her 
ttchair, speak in her voice... He tried 
ttto be his mother.
ttt(A sad smile)
ttAnd now he is.
ttt(A pause)
ttThat's what I meant when I said I 
ttgot the story from the mother. She 
ttthinks Norman has been taken away... 
ttbecause of his crimes.  She insists 
ttshe did nothing, that Norman committed 
ttall the murders just to keep her 
ttfrom being discovered. She even smiled 
tta bit coquettishly as she said that. 
ttOf course, she feels badly about 
ttit... but also somewhat relieved to 
ttbe, as she put it, free of Norman, 
ttat last.
ttt(A pause)
ttWhen the mind houses two 
ttpersonalities, there is always a 
ttbattle. In Norman's case, the battle 
ttis over... and the dominant 
ttpersonality has won.

tLila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for 
tNorman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world. 
tSam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her.

<b>ttttCHAMBERS
</b>ttt(To Simon)
ttAnd the forty thousand dollars?  Who 
ttgot that?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttThe swamp. These were murders of 
ttpassion, not profit.

tA POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near-
twhisper, to the Chief of Police. The Guard is carrying a 
tfolded blanket over his arm.

<b>ttttPOLICE GUARD
</b>ttHe feels a little chill... can I 
ttbring him this blanket?

tThe Chief of Police nods. The Guard goes away, and CAMERA 
tFOLLOWS him out of the room and out into the hallway. Guard 
tmoves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor.

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR IN COURTHOUSE
</b>
tA narrower corridor in the rear of the building. In f.g. of 
tshot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered 
tglass. A GUARD in uniform is posted by the door, looking 
treprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance 
tinto the room.

tThe Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this 
tcorridor, goes to the door. CAMERA MOVES CLOSE. The uniformed 
tGuard opens the door, allows the man to go in.

tShot is RAKED so that we can not see into the room.

tAfter a moment, the Guard comes out and the uniformed Guard 
tcloses and locks the door and we

<b>ttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. NORMAN'S DETENTION ROOM - (NIGHT)
</b>
tThe walls are white and plain. There is no window.

tThere is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which 
tNorman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a quality 
tof no-whereness, of calm separation from the world.

tThe Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees. 
tNorman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding 
tit. His face, although without makeup and without the 
tsurrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity 
tabout it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch 
twomanliness about the brows.

tCalmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if 
tit were a cashmere shawl. CAMERA REMAINS in a position so 
tthat our view of Norman is a FULL ONE. When the shawl is in 
tposition, and Norman is settled, we HEAR, OVER SHOT, the 
tvoice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts.

<b>ttttMOTHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttIt's sad... when a mother has to 
ttspeak the words that condemn her own

ttThey'll put him away now... as I

ttintended to tell them I killed those

ttt(A pause)
ttWell, they know I can't even move a

tA fly buzzes close, and then continues buzzing and flying 
tabout Norman's face.
