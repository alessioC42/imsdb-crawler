</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>tOn complete darkness.
tA SMALL DOOR swings open.
tA circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the 
tlength of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a 
tgloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the 
tfrightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind 
tit. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to 
tpad down the tube s length.
tAfter several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit 
tcubicle. The rat hesitates and stops.
tThe SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s 
tears.
tThe rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a 
tdoor swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle.
tThe rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING.
tThe rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, 
tbut the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on 
tthe far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and 
tdashes toward it.
tBut an invisible force descends.
tThe rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its 
tbody, crushing it.
tA LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air, 
thalting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes, 
tstruggling against the unholy force.
tThen a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life 
tquickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes...
tThe creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white 
tfur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood.
tHUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked 
tape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into 
tthe rat.
<b>ttttttttt
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>tINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>tIn the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the 
tTonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer 
tscreen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with 
tthe shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry 
tframed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips 
tcoffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a 
tcomplex computer rendered molecule displayed on his 
tscreen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts 
tslightly, then falls apart.
tSebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the 
tcellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard 
twith renewed vigor.
tAnother molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s 
tfingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on 
tand off, it trembles and twists apart.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttDamnit.
tSebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a 
tlight comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a 
tBRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her 
tliving room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses 
tit and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to 
tthe window, getting interested. But when the brunette 
treaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window 
tand lowers her shades.
ttttSEBASTIAN (cont d)
tttDamnit.
tSebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. 
tHe s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at 
tthe ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big 
tred letters is a brief reminder -  You Should Be 
tWorking.  Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins 
tpecking away again.
<b>tttttttttt 
</b><b>LATER:
</b>tThe television is now only static. We pan by his alarm 
tclock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his 
tcomputer.
tHe gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away 
tagain. The molecule reforms on the computer screen.
tHe types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. 
tNothing happens.
tHe hits a few more keys and watches intently for a 
treaction.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttt (beat)
tttI am a goddamn genius.
tHe hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on 
tthe screen. He dials.
<b>ttttttttt
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b><b>tINT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>tDigital phone rings.
tIn the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a 
tdeep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her 
tdesk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her.
tThe ringing continues. She moves her computer mouse 
taround and her screen comes to life. She click on a 
ttelephone icon and the ringing stops. A beat later, 
tSebastian appears in a window on her screen.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttSebastian, do you know what time it 
tttis?
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN (SCREEN)
</b>tttYou know Da Vinci never slept. Said it 
tttwas waste of time.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWhat is it this time?
<b>tINTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM
</b>tSebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer 
twindow. He notices something behind her in the bed, the 
tyoung man sleeping face down.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWho s that?
tLinda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer 
tscreen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttNot your business. Not anymore.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttTouche.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttSo you calling about anything in 
tttparticular, or were you just hoping to 
tttcatch me sleeping in the nude?
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI cracked the reversion.
tUpon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttYou cracked it?
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttLook at this. 
tSebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the 
tmolecular structure appears on Linda s computer.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWatch this.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttYou sure?
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>ttt91% sure.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttt (astonished)
tttEleven months with no progress and you 
tttsuddenly come up with it out of the 
tttblue? How?
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttThe usual. Coffee and twinkies.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttI hate you.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI know. You think you could hunt down 
tttMatt and get to the lab early. I want 
tttIsabelle prepped for a live test.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttYeah, I think I can find him. What are 
tttyou going to do?
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWell y know. It s daylight in 
tttSwitzerland. I gotta call the Nobel
tttCommittee and tell them to get our
tttprizes ready. See you in a few.
tON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda 
tcrosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttHey... come on.
tDR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under 
tsheets.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttt (groggy)
tttWhat?
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttSebastian just called. We gotta get to 
tttthe lab.
tMatt bolts up.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttShit! You didn t tell him I was here, 
tttdid you?
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttGive me some credit, will ya.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttSo what s the rush?
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttHe cracked reversion.
tMatt pulls his jeans on.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWanna ride down?
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWe better take our own cars.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttYou re gonna have to tell him about us 
ttteventually.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttI know. It s just You re his best 
tttfriend. He ll feel betrayed.
<b>tEXT. WASHINGTON D.C. SKYLINE - DAY
</b>tFrom a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in 
tthe harsh light of morning.
tCAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security 
tfence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is 
tsurrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire.
tThe Porsche is waved through security and heads straight 
tinto the warehouse.
<b>tINT. WAREHOUSE -DAY
</b>tThe Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space 
tand Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, 
tand Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the 
tlot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the 
twarehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16.
<b>ttttMARINE GUARD
</b>tttMorning, sir.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttMorning, Ed.
<b>ttttMARINE GUARD
</b>tttYour team s in early. Something 
tttspecial going on?
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttSorry, Ed. You know the rules. 
tSebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A 
tlaser reads his print. 
tScan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN 
tClearance:    ALPHA ALPHA THREE 
tDivision:tCLASSIFIED 
tThe doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside.
<b>ttttMARINE GUARD
</b>tttHave a good day, sir.
<b>tINT. ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>tInside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian 
ttaps in his floor code.
<b>ttttELEVATOR (V.0.)
</b>tttAuthorization please.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttCaine zero zero two seven.
<b>ttttELEVATOR (V.0.)
</b>tttAuthorization verified. Good morning, 
tttDr. Caine. 
tThe elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes 
tbelow us and keeps descending into the belly of the 
tearth, the shaft goes down forever.
<b>tINT. HABITAT S CORRIDOR
</b>tWe slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas 
tchambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a 
tspecific animal, although no animals are visible.
tAs we pass one habitat, something slams into the 
tPlexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then 
tSCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen 
tanimal cries. THUMP.
<b>tTHUMP.
</b>tThe Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry 
tanimals were slamming against it. But still, no animals 
tare seen.
tAbove each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES 
trevealing heat signatures of the various animals, but 
tthey remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a 
tsheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly 
tempty cage.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttIsabelle ...
tThe woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the 
tPlexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The 
tPlexiglas begins to shake violently.
ttttMATT (cont d)
tttCalm down baby. Calm down. It s 
tttokay...
tMatt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and 
tpulls them down over his eyes. 
tTHERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in 
tshape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the 
tPlexiglas door and reaches inside.
ttttMATT (cont d)
tttIt s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not 
tttgoing to hurt you. Come here.
tTHERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs 
thold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt 
treaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature.
ttttMATT (cont d)
tttJust hold still. 
tSomething clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. 
tBlood erupts in a bite pattern.
ttttMATT (cont d)
ttt Ow, shit.
tMatt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies 
topen and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see 
tthe heat signature running down the hallway. He turns 
taround to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt 
tpulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the 
tCorridor.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttYou okay?
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttShe bit me.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttYeah. She s become a lot more 
tttaggressive in the last few days.
tLinda takes the goggles from Matt.
ttttLINDA (cont d)
tttGo take care of that bite. I ll get 
ttther.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttAnd give you a chance to pull ahead? 
tttNever.
tLinda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and 
tpulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt.
<b>tAROUND THE CORNER
</b>tA slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. 
tWe hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS.
tLooking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a 
thaunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed 
tthough and something large and angry is throwing itself 
tagainst it. We can t see anything.
tA few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, 
twearing goggles and leveling their pistols.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttt (ala Porky)
tttShh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting 
tttsimians.   heheheheh.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttKnock it off.
tttt (soothing voice)
tttIsabelle!
tTHERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering 
theat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda 
tfires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air. 
tThen falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it 
tstops inches above the ground. 
tTHERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at 
tLinda s feet.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttGood shootin , Tex.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWhat s that make it?
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttI m still ahead. 6 to 5.
tLike a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from 
tthe top of her tranquilizer gun.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttBut I m catching up.
<b>tINT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>tThe elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met 
tby SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttCan I have a word?
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttMost normal people say good morning.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttDon t you think you should test the 
tttprotocol on the liver samples before 
tttyou inject Isabelle?
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttHow many tissue samples have we 
tttsuccessfully regressed? Hundreds, 
tttright? How many have gone on to work 
ttton the full system? None.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttThat s beside the point.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttNo, that is the point. I m not going 
tttto waste six months of my life on an 
tttoutmoded testing procedure. This thing 
tttworks. I know it. I feel it.
tLinda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail 
tend of the conversation.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttFine. You can mop up afterward.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYou think I m going to kill Isabelle?
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttKill? More like liquefy.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttSarah, thank you for your opinion, but 
tttI m the project leader. Understand? 
tShe says ...
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttYes, Sir.
t... but somehow it feels like  Fuck you.  She storms off. 
tSebastian turns to Linda.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttHow did you ever convince me to hire 
ttther?
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttYou said you wanted the beat vet in 
tttthe country.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYeah, well she cares more about the 
tttanimals than the research.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttMaybe that s why she s so good.
<b>ttttttttt
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b>tCLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As 
tit s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and 
treaches in, removing...
<b>tA GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID.
</b>tSebastian peers at the vial.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWho da Man? You da Man.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttAs we pull out we see we are.
<b>tINT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>tAlmost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech 
tFrankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical 
treadouts, bizarre medical equipment.
tOn a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over 
ta humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. 
tThe straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the 
tbody to lots of machinery.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttProtocol is hot.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttVitals?
tSarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, 
tblood pressure, the rest.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttNormal.
tCARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in 
ta cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the table and 
tpushes aside the sheet.
<b>ttttBOOMING VOICE
</b><b>tttTHIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE
</b><b>tttNATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE
</b><b>tttSEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY.
</b><b>tttGOD HAS SPOKEN.
</b><b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttHow many times do I have to tell you, 
tttFrank you aren t God.
tttt (beat)
tttI am.
<b>ttttFRANK (LOUDSPEAKER)
</b>tttSorry, Boss. Forgot.
tSebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the 
tLaboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the booth.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYou guys ready to roll?
<b>tINT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
</b>tFRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE 
tWALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab. 
tThey re dressed more like band roadies than scientists.
tThe room is crammed with electronic and recording 
tequipment. A handful of monitors display different images 
tof the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen 
tmonitors vital signs.
<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttWe are live and in color. On your 
tttmark.
tFrank and Janice looks down on their colleagues. 
tSebastian nods their way.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttOkay. Roll  em.
<b>ttttJANICE
</b>tttOkay. We are rolling record on videos 
tttone through twelve.
tFrank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a 
tmicrophone. Recording.
<b>tINT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>tFrank s voice echoes through the chamber.
<b>ttttFRANK (V.O.)
</b>tttSubject Isabelle Two. Currently in 
tttphase shift... one hundred twenty six 
tttdays, eighteen hours.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttTesting De-Phase protocol. Injecting 
tttserial protein Caine One Two Five. 
tLinda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a 
tcentrifuge nearby.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttMaybe if you stopped naming them after 
tttyourself, you d have better luck.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWhy thank you, Dr. Kensington, for 
tttthat keen scientific observation. I ll 
tttbe sure to include it in my memoirs.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttA whole mention? And I thought I was 
tttjust gonna be a footnote.
tMatt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into 
tthe vial, drawing up the colored liquid.
<b>tINT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
</b><b>ttttMATT
</b>tttOkay.
tFrank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals.
<b>tINT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>tTension in the air.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttt (to Linda)
tttReady.
tShe wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it 
ttight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface 
tappears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in 
tthe light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the 
tsurface several times. A small bulge appears, like a 
tvein.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttPropped.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttLet s make some history.
tMatt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the 
thypo from Matt s hand.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttNice try, Sparky.
tMatt relinquishes the needle.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttCome on, Isabelle. You can do this. 
tSebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The 
tneedle remains in sight after it slips through the 
tvisible surface. Matt presses down on the hypo plunger, 
treleasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid 
ttwists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. 
tIt s the shape of a vein. The liquid begins to react. 
tSmall flashes of light blip up and down the strand of 
tcolor. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed 
tup.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttElevated heartbeat.
<b>tINT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
</b>tJanice analyzes the screens.
<b>ttttJANICE
</b>tttWe re still in the green.
<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttConfirmed. Vitals still in the normal 
tttrange.
<b>tINT. LABORATORY
</b>tThe glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex 
twebbing of a bloodstream appears.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttIt s reacting.
tSpreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes 
tvisible.. the shadow of a skeletal system.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttDo you see this?
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttIt s working. It s actually working. 
tMatt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to 
tappear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttHeart rate s up. She s scared.
tSarah soothes her.
ttttSARAH (cont d)
tttIt's okay, baby. It's okay.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttSubject began manifesting almost 
tttImmediately. Protocol is reacting 
tttquickly.
tIsabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She 
tbegins to howl.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttSubject may be in pain or extreme 
tttdiscomfort.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttGoddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. 
tttBrain activity going through the roof. 
tThe brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out. 
tThe shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the 
tinside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror.
ttttSARAH (cont d)
tttWe ve got a problem.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWhat? What problem!
tSarah checks her monitors.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttIt s her heart. We can see the heart 
tttbeating in the ape s
<b>ttttFRANK (V.0.)
</b>tttI got an erratic heart beat.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttShe s going into cardiac arrest.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttGot the crash cart.
tCarter charges the crash cart and rolls it in.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttWe re losing her.
tHer machine flatlines.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttNo! It s got to work.
tThe body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in 
tdecomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttClear!
tLinda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt 
tof electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief 
tmoment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttWe ve got something!
tThe heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its 
tmarch toward,visibility.
ttttSARAH (cont d)
tttStill. erratic.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttCome on Isabelle. Come on. You can do 
tttit. You can fucking do it.
tEverybody s pulling for her.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttCome on, monkey.
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttDo it. Do it. Come on.
tMuscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists 
tand turns, frightened. Then skin. The monkey howls. Skin 
tforms over the muscles reappearing like it was being 
tpainted on before our eyes.
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttStabilizing.
tThe entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as 
tif it was discharging some stored energy.
<b>ttttFRANK (V.0.)
</b>tttBrain activity returning to normal.
tThe monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda 
thovers over it stroking its fur.
<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWelcome back, Isabelle.
tSebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move 
tthat does not go unnoticed by Matt. We did it.
<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttt (beat)
tttHow is she?
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttt (surprised)
tttI think she s gonna be okay
<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. HABITAT
</b>
tFrank, Matt, Sarah, Janice and Linda watch Isabelle rise 
tand walk about the cage. She goes over to the other 
tmonkeys and joins in their grooming rituals.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttAmazing. She's normal, absolutely 
ttthealthy. If you didn't know any 
tttbetter, you'd think nothing had 
ttthappened to her.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttt (ribbing Sarah)
tttYeah. I can't wait to slice up her 
tttbrain and trace her neural pathways.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttScrew you, Matt.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWell maybe not right away.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWe should celebrate.

<b>tINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
tThe fanciest one in D.C.

tThe entire eight person team sits around a round table, 
tdrunk and laughing, as the last champagne flute is 
tfilled.

tSebastian raises his glass.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttTo the finest research team I've ever 
tttknown.

tA round of "Hear, hears" and they all clink glasses and 
tdrink.

<b>tEXT. RESTAURANT BALCONY - LATER
</b>
tThe din of the diners fades away as Linda slips out onto 
tthe restaurant's balcony. She find Sebastian leaning 
tagainst a railing, breathing in the night air.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttHey...

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttI thought you'd gone.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWhere would I go?

tHe looks out over the sweep of the city, the twinkling 
tlights of D.C. and darkness of the Potomac river.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttTwenty years ago there were no 
tttcomputers, no fax machines, no cell 
tttphones. I was just wondering what the 
tttworld will be like twenty years from 
tttnow... if what we're doing will change 
ttteverything.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttA little "I am become death... the 
tttshatterer of worlds"?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttSomething like that.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttSince the day I met, all you wanted to 
tttdo was change the world.

tShe puts her hand on his shoulder.

ttttLINDA (cont'd)
tttListen, I know we've... I mean... well 
ttt... I just want you to know how proud 
tttI am of you. I know it probably 
tttdoesn't mean a lot...

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttActually it does.
tttt (beat)
tttI guess since you were there from the 
tttbeginning, you know me better than 
tttanyone else on this godforsaken 
tttplanet.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttYou're positively maudlin. You should 
tttbe happy. Do you have any idea what 
tttyou've accomplished?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYeah... but I was working so hard, I 
tttdidn't realize I'd have no one to 
tttshare it with.

tSebastian heads back inside. But he stops and turns back.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttI don't suppose we could turn back the 
tttclock for a night and you could come 
ttthome with me?

tHer look says it all. Too much water under the bridge.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttRight. Sorry. Too much champagne.

tHe turns and heads back into the party. As he heads in he 
tpasses Matt heading out. He and Sebastian exchange 
t"Heys".

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWhat was that about?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttNothing. It's just... He is who he is. 
tttSometimes I just have to be reminded.

<b>ttttttttt
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
tSebastian wanders through the empty hallways of the 
tlaboratory.

<b>tINT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
</b>
tSebastian paces back and forth, examining the habitats.

</b>
tFlying over Washington D. C. , we cross the Potomac and

tgloomy on this grey day.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN (V.0.)
</b>tttSix years ago, this committee 
tttcommissioned me with a very specific 
ttttask...

<b>tINT. PENTAGON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
tAt the table are six men. A handful of senior military 
tbrass and top civilian advisors direct their attention to 
tthe front of the room, where Sebastian, flanked by Matt 
tand Linda, is in the middle of his presentation.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttTo successful phase-shift a human 
tttbeing out of quantum sync with the 
tttvisible universe and then return him 
tttsafely, with no after affects.

tNext to Sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting 
tfrom the visible spectrum. It's hair, skin, organs and 
tskeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttWell, we found out sending them to 
ttt"never-never-land" was easy, it's the 
tttgetting back that's hard.

tSebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video 
tscreen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone 
tthat used to be alive.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttEvery time we've tried to bring a test 
tttsubject back from phase-shift. 
tttCellular bonds would dissolve, the 
tttprimary DNA strands would decay. But 
tttnow...

tSebastian pauses. Something's bothering him.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttBut now...

tOne of the senior advisers, DR. HARRY KRAMER, 
tdistinguished 50s, finally breaks the silence.

<b>ttttKRAMER
</b>tttBut now?

tLinda and Matt look up at Sebastian expectantly.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
</b>tttBut now...
tttt (pause)
tttBut now, we feel we are closer than 
tttever to resolving this issue. We've 
tttbeen experimenting with a new 
tttregression formula that looks rather 
tttpromising.
tttA FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward.

<b>ttttGENERAL
</b>tttHow long?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttSir?

<b>ttttGENERAL
</b>tttSon, as you can imagine, we are very 
tttanxious to field test this tactical

tttissue?

tLinda starts to speak, but Sebastian cuts her off with a 
tlook.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttShouldn't be more than another year, 
tttSir.

tFrustrated sighs all around the room.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttMaybe sooner.

tAs Linda, Matt and Sebastian head to their cars.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttYo. Reality check! What the hell was 
tttthat about?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttKeep your voice down.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttThe protocol works. Why'd you tell 
tttthem it didn't?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI wasn't ready for them to know.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttBut they're the oversight committee. 
tttThey're supposed to know.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttI'm sure he had a reason.
tttt (firmly)
tttYou did have a reason, didn't you, 
tttSebastian?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI had more than a reason. I had a

tThey reach his Porsche.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttWhat do you think they'd do if they 
tttknow we could send a subject into 
tttphase shift and pull it back out 
tttagain? How many seconds would it take 
tttfor them to take over the whole 
tttproject, bringing in their soldiers to 
ttttest the formula on. We'd have lost 
tttcontrol of it by the end of the week.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttIt's their money, Sebastian. It's 
tttgoing to happen eventually.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI know. But not yet. There's too much 
tttfor us to learn. I don't want my hands 
ttttied by their political agenda when we 
tttgo to phase three.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWell, then... mind telling us how 
tttyou're gonna get a human test-subject 
tttfor phase three without the committee 
tttfinding out?

</b>ttt... on myself.

tThe team sits around the conference table. Their jaws 
tdrop and they stare at him with wide eyes.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttAre you nuts?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWas Jonas Salk nuts?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttYeah. Pretty sure he was.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttAnd remember, for every Jonas Salk, 
tttthere are a bunch of guys who aren't 
tttfamous cuz they died.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttIf we're that unsure, how can we 
tttmorally justify testing it on someone 
tttelse?

<b>ttttJANICE
</b>tttIsn't it a little soon to be moving 
tttinto phase three anyway?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttShe's right. We haven't even finished 
tttcollating the phase two research.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWe'll have plenty of time to collate 
tttand cross-reference later. Monkey data 
tttdoesn't matter anyway. The only real

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttYou don't even know if any of the

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttHow are we gonna find out? Besides, 
tttwe've succeeded with a gorilla and 
ttttheir DNA is 98% the same as humans. 
tttAnd the 2% is not that significant.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttSebastian ... humans can talk, build

tttGorilla's live in trees. That's a 
ttthelluva 2% if you ask me.

</b>tttWe're all concerned. I know that. But

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWhy you? Why not one of us?

</b>tttt (interrupting)
tttWhat if we volunteer?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWhat if you're too valuable to lose?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI'm Project Leader. It's my formula 
tttand my call. The best way to express 
tttyour concern is to make damn sure you 
tttdo your best work. I'll want about

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttTo put your affairs in order?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttTo run some more reversions and tissue

</b>
tA knock on the door.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttWhat?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttIn the past six years, I've never once

ttt... Sebastian. I don't think you

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYou don't understand.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttOh please. How long were we together? 
tttYou must've said it a million times 
ttt... Nobody knows who built the lunar

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttHe refuses to listen to reason.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttCan we talk about this later? I'm 
ttttrying to make love to you.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttSorry. I just can't let it go.

tMatt props himself up on the pillow.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttI know how you're feeling. Hell, he 
tttand I've been friends since freshman

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttSo how can we let him do this?

tttyou go?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttIn a heartbeat.

</b>tttWhat if they didn't know whether or

tLinda thinks about it. It's still tempting.

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttThis is his chance to be Chuck Yeager 
tttor Christopher Columbus. Well, if I 
tttwere him I'd do the same thing.

tMatt goes back to kissing Linda.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttLet me ask another question.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttIs about who gets to be on top?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttIs the human race really ready for 
tttwhat we're doing?

tMatt groans and rolls over.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWhy do you always get philosophical 
tttbefore we're about to get physical?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttNo really. Is it ready? We're 
tttbarrelling down a road that begs moral 
tttand ethical questions that I don't 
tttthink we can answer.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttThey said the same thing about the

tttnuclear age... but here we are.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttThis night is still young.
tttt (beat)
tttI mean, when you think about it, it's

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWe made our deal with the devil years

tSebastian stripped to his shorts paces nervously. A knock 
ton the door.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttt (his voice catches)
tttYes?

tMatt sticks his head in.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWe're ready.

tSebastian nervously shakes his limbs out. Then nods.

</b>tttOkay.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttIt's not too late to back out. I'm

</b>tttNervous?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttA little.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttEver tell you the one about Superman 
tttand Wonder Woman?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI don't think so.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttSo Superman's flying around the city, 
tttand he's horny as hell.  Lo and behold 
ttthe looks down and sees Wonder Woman, 
tttcompletely nude, sunning herself up on 
tttthe roof of the Justice League. I mean 
tttshe is lying there naked and spread 
ttteagle. So Superman starts thinking, 
ttt"man... this is too easy. I could go 
tttdown there, do a little fast pumping 
tttand be gone before she even sees me." 
tttAfter all he is faster than a speeding 
tttbullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down, 
ttttakes care of business so quick, you 
tttcan't even see him. Well ... I tell 
tttya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised 
tttas hell and says "What the hell was 
tttthat." And the Invisible Man replies 
ttt"I dunno know, but it sure hurt like 
ttthell."

<b>tINT. LABORATORY

tSebastian shoots Matt a look.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYou know, that could be the last joke 
tttI ever hear.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttC'mon, man. That's funny shit.

tThe buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified 
tHEARTBEAT, thumping its familiar rhythm. Bah-bump. 
tBah-bump. In the center of the room, Sebastian, dressed 
tonly in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table 
tinclined at a 45 degree angle. Electrodes are strapped to 
this body. An I.V. tube snakes from the needle in his vein 
tup to a bag of saline solution. Dripping slowly. Linda 
tmakes last minute checks of some of the equipment. She 
tpats Sebastian on the shoulder.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttO.K. How're you feeling?
<b>ttt
</b>tttSebastian takes a deep breath.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttFine.

tSarah checks his vitals.

</b>tttPulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit 
tttelevated.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttTo be expected.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttNo reason for concern. He's ready. 

tLinda takes a moment and studies Sebastian's face. She's 
talmost teary eyed.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttHey... it's gonna be okay.

tLinda nods. Back to business.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttStart recording.

tJanice hits record on the equipment decks.

<b>ttttJANICE
</b>tttWe're hot. All systems nominal,

</b>tttOkay, kids. Let's make some history.

<b>tINT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
tFrank's voice echoes through the chamber.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttSubject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs. 

tMatt jabs a hypodermic into small vial of colored liquid. 
tDraws up 20ccs.

tLinda takes the hypo from Matt.

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttIf the tests are any indication it 
tttshould work quickly.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI'll inject myself. If anything goes 
tttwrong, they can't blame you.

tShe hands the hypo Sebastian and steps away. Sebastian 
tstares at the golden formula silently for a moment.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWe can still shut down, Sebastian.

tHe shakes his head.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttAny last words?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said

tpound out a dulling rhythm.

tLinda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the

tShe's having real trouble staying awake. The buzzing 
tfluorescent light isn't helping either.

<b>tINT. RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tThe sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the

tThe door handle turns and the door pushes open.

tthe glass wall, revealing the empty hallway behind it.

tBut a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had

tttHmm.

tSarah's hair moves slightly, as if a hand were running 
tthrough it. And then we see her shirt move, like fingers 
twere tracing over it. Down from the shoulder to her 
tbreast. Around her nipple. Sarah moans slightly, as if 
tshe were dreaming, but she doesn't stir. And then her 
tbreasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched... 
tsoftly... gently. Her breathing becomes harder, more 
tlabored, erotic... and then she... BOLTS AWAKE. Bar eyes 
twide with fear. She jumps and cups her own breasts and 
tlooks around the room. It's empty, of course. She jumps 
tover to the monitor and checks on Sebastian's room. The 
theat signature isn't there.

<b>tINT. RESEARCH LAB - DAY
</b>
tSebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination 
tchair. Wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttSo, how was your first night?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttRestless. Hard to sleep when you can't

</b>tttYeah? What'd you do?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttGot up a couple of times. Knocked

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI didn't think it was a problem.

</b>tttIt isn't. I just don't want it to

</b>tttWe'll have to draw some more blood.

<b>ttttttttt
</b><b>tCUT TO:
</b>
tSarah rolls up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air. 
tShe wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it 
ttight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye. She 
tacts very self conscious.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttYou okay?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttYeah. Why?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYou just seem a little nervous.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttNo. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This 
tttmight hurt a bit.

tThe surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda 
tsearches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, 
tthen plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin. His skin 
tbends and gives. The needle remains in sight after it 
tslips through the visible surface. Sarah presses down on 
tthe hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttDr. Caine... this might sounds stupid, 
tttbut are you... are you looking at me. 

tThe red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and 
tdown his arm. His vein.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttNo. I was looking at the clock. Why? 

tSarah draws the plunger back, sucking Sebastian's blood 
tinto the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttJust felt like someone was staring at 
tttme.

tSarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a 
tgrease pencil. After a few beats the red dye in 
tSebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as 
tdoes the liquid in the vial.

tDim lights. Janice and Frank both don eye guards. Frank 
tswitches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots 
tacross the room. The beam distorts slightly in the center

tspectral rainbows, momentary illuminating Sebastian's 
tentire frame in a glowing tingle of light.

<b>tINT. MAIN LABORATORY

tLINDA pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood 
tsample slides. She slips them under the microscope. She 
ttakes a sip of her Diet Coke and puts it on the table. 
tShe pears into the microscope and analyses the blood 
tsample, squeezing more stain onto it. She looks up to 
tmake notations, but when she reaches for her Diet Coke IT 
tISN'T THERE. She looks around. It's on the other side of 
ther microscope. She shrugs it off, she takes a sip and 
tsets it down where it was before. She peers into the 
tmicroscope again and when she looks up... the Diet Coke 
tis gone. She looks around the room and sees it on another 
ttable completely.

tSebastian, in scrubs and make-up, paces back and forth.

tHe slams the wall in frustration. He crosses to a mirror

tBut as he does, he notices a light come on in the window 
tacross the courtyard. Sebastian turns off his bedroom 
tlight and moves toward the window. He peers across the 
tcourtyard into the Brunette's apartment.

tHe watches the Brunette as she comes into the living room 
tfrom her front hallway. She drops her keys on the table 
tand begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the 
twindow. Just as the blouse slips off her shoulder, she 
tpulls her blinds shut.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttShit.

tFrustrated, Sebastian steps away from the window and then 
tstops. Something has occurred to him.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttDon't even think it...

tHe looks down and notices his hand is trembling. His 
tbreathing is a little heavy. A little nervous. He catches 
ta glimpse at himself in the mirror.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttt (almost whispering)
tttOnce...just once.

tThe Brunette's living room light switches off and the

tof his hand and peels the latex skin off.

<b>tEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

tThe doorbell rings. With a frustrated sigh, the brunette 
trises.

</b>
tShe peers through the peep hole. No one's there. But as 
tshe turns she hears the doorbell again. She opens the

tPuzzled she heads back inside her apartment.

tWe follow her as she crosses to her bedroom, but a moment 
tlater, the bedroom door closes on its own.

tWe hear a SCREAM come from the other side. Then another. 
tThen a muffled struggled. And we...

tAnd then she tries the door. It's unlocked. She pushes 
tthe door open.

tAs she hangs up the phone, and heads out. The CAMERA 
tdoesn't follow, but instead pushes through the blinds and

tWe push over to the bathroom sink. The faucet turns on 
tand the water starts running.

tWe see the water cup under the faucet and splash against

tThen the water slips away.

tFor second it sounds like he's crying, but then we hear

</b>tttDon't make a mountain out of molehill.

</b>tttThat's not good enough. When you're

</b>tttCome on, Linda. You don't expect me to

</b>tttMatt?

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttSorry, man. You'd do the same if it

tA long beat. Sebastian slowly rises, acknowledges Linda 
twith a nod and leaves the room. Linda looks around at her

</b>tttt (contentious)
tttHow much blood do you think you've

tThe surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttDon't patronize me.

tttAnd for the record, you've got no idea

tSebastian holds his latex head on his lap, while EEG 
tleads hang suspended in mid-air, outlining his real head. 
tCarter analyzes the results.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttWhen you were a kid, you ever dream 
tttabout being invisible?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttSure... all the time.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttWhat did you imagine you'd do?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttThe usual.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttWhat's the usual?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttHanging out in the girl's locker room. 
tttKicking Jimmy Margiani's ass.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttJimmy Margiani?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttSchool asshole. Drove a red Trans Am. 
tttBack then, I was the size of a small 
tttplanet and made a rather large target.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttEver think up anything along the grand 
tttscale?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttSure. World domination. Manipulating 
tttstock markets, consolidating a 
tttpolitical power base. But those are 
tttmore recent fantasies.

tCarter pulls off the electrodes and Sebastian slides on 
this latex facemask.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttAnd what if it weren't fantasy? What 
tttif you were out there in the world and 
tttcould do whatever you wanted with no 
tttconsequences whatsoever. How far would 
tttgo? I mean... if it were real?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttI don't know, man. Out in the real 
tttworld... I mean, there's a 
tttresponsibility...

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttLet's say you saw a woman with amazing 
ttttits. Would you brush against them?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttHell, I try and do that now.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttHuman nature. So if you could get away 
tttwith more, would you do more?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttI read that in a survey at a major 
tttuniversity they asked college students 
ttt"Would you steal if you were 
tttguaranteed to get away with it?" 82% 
tttsaid yes.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttEighty two percent? Makes you wonder 
tttif the world's ready for what we're 
tttdoing.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttSo, Doc what did you do?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttWhen you were out.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI just walked around. Y'know.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttAw, you just walked around? Come on. 
tttThere's more, right?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttLike what?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttMan, I'd be walking up to people 
tttsaying shit like "This is God, go,get 
ttta haircut." Or hanging out in the 
tttchanging room at Victoria's Secret.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttKind of sophomoric, don't you think. 
tttBesides, it was late and I wasn't out 
tttthat long.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttWell, did you see anybody?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttThere was this one girl.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttYeah? And did you mess with her? 

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttNaw...

tSebastian gives Carter a sly grin.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttWell maybe a little.
tttt (beat)
tttI tell you though, a man could get 
tttused to it.

<b>tINT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
tAlone, Linda packs up her stuff for the evening.

tSlowly we push in on her and hear quiet breathing. We 
trealize we are in...

<b>tSEBASTIAN'S POV
</b>
tThen ...

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttGoodnight.

tLinda-jumps.

ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
tttSorry, didn't mean to frighten you.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttIt's fine. I just didn't know you were 
tttthere. Goodnight.

tAs she leaves the Lab, he follows her down the hallway.

<b>tEXT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
tLinda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment 
tbuilding. A few beats later, as if caught by a gust of 
twind, the revolving door slowly turns on its own.

<b>tINT. APARTMENT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tLinda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind 
ther. A moment later we see the doorknob turn back and 
tforth. It's locked.

<b>tEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
tOn a fire escape, we see the ladder shake and descend to 
tthe ground. The metal rattles back and forth as if 
tsomething were climbing it.

tWe slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window. 
tThrough the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see 
tLinda enter the room. The panel of glass fogs from 
tSebastian's breath. The fog wipes away, seemingly by 
titself.

tBut then through the window we see Matt walk into the 
tliving room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We 
thear a shocked intake of air.

tHe kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her 
tdress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat 
tand drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the 
tbuttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging 
tkisses.

tMatt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses 
this way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to 
ther.

tSuddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and 
tLinda jump back covering themselves.

tWe hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the 
tfire escape.

tA moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out. He 
tsees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down 
tbelow.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWhat was it?

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttI don't know. I don't see anything. 

tMatt picks up a piece of glass and examines it.

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttIt's like something hit it.

tLinda picks up the phone and dials.

<b>tINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tCarter picks up the phone.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttHello?

tCarter looks at the security monitor of the recovery 
troom. Sebastian's heat signature lies still on the bed.

ttttCARTER (cont'd)
tttNo. No. He's here No, I'm staring at 
ttthim. He's right there in his room.

<b>tINT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tLinda breathes a sigh of relief.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttThanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye.
tttt (hangs up phone)
tttPhew.

tMatt pulls her into him.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttRelax... it's nothing. Where were we?

<b>tINT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tBARKING can be heard in the background. That horrible 
trepetitive barking that grates the soul like Chinese 
twater torture.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttBe quiet!

tA photograph of Linda drifts through the air and settles 
tatop a flaming candle. It ignites into fire, twisting and 
tturning in mid-air, then falling on the floor as ash. A 
tbeat later water runs from the sink faucet. It forms in 
tthe shape of hands and splashes against his face, 
tdripping away.

ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
tttAnd the cyclops screamed out, "Who is 
tttit who blinds me?" and Odysseus 
tttreplied "Nobody is my name". And the 
tttCyclops raged to his friends "Nobody 
tttis killing me. Nobody".

tThe barking continues. A moment later the chamber door 
tslides open. We push down the...

<b>tHALLWAY OF THE HABITATS
</b>
t... until we are face-to-face with the unhappy barking 
tdog.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttShhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing.

tThe Plexiglas door to the doggie's cage swings open and 
tsome invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck. 
tThe force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the 
tbarking stops.

ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
tttNobody's gonna hurt you. 

tThe force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes 
tlimp. Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and 
tover until blood spills out its mouth. The Plexiglas door 
tswings closed again and moments later the door to 
tSebastian's cubicle closes as well. The water runs in 
tSebastian's sink washing the blood away from his now half 
tvisible hands.

<b>tttttttt
</b><b>tDISSOLVE TO:

</b>
tSarah sees the dead dog lying prone on its bedding. She 
teyes it curiously and opens the cage door.

<b>tINT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER
</b>
tSarah stares at the empty chamber.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttYou awake?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttI am now.

tThe sheets raise and drape off of him.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttNotice anything unusual last night. 

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttNo. Why?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttFranklin Three. He's dead.

tSebastian pulls a sheet around him. He moves across the 
tdimly lit room like a ghost.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttWhat of?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttHis neck was broken and his windpipe 
tttcollapsed.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttHow'd that happen?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttI thought maybe you could tell me.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttSarah... You saying I had something to 
tttdo with it?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttHe was alive last night when I left 
tttand he was dead this morning. And you 
tttwere the only one down here.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttI was in my room all night.

<b>tINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
tSarah sits with Carter as they run through the security 
tvideo tape. Matt and Linda look over their shoulder.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttThat's all twelve hours.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttHe never left the room.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttA windpipe doesn't just suddenly 
tttcollapse. Someone or something killed 
tttit.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttYou saw the tape. The man was in his 
tttchamber.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttThen we have a problem, because I the 
tttcage was locked from the outside. That 
tttmeans it was opened, the dog was 
tttkilled and the cage was closed and 
tttlocked again. Only a human could do 
tttthat.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttWell, it wasn't me.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttAnd it wasn't him.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttAre we sure?

<b>tINT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tLinda passes Sebastian's chamber. Sebastian's in latex.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttAny big plans for tonight?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttQuiet night at home. Maybe a book.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttReally? Whatever happened to that guy 
tttyour were seeing?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttHe's still in the picture. Why?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttBeing locked down here, I'm forced to 
tttlive vicariously. Someday you'll have 
tttto tell me what he's like.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttMaybe someday I will. See you in the 
tttmorning.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttAu domain.

tSebastian watches Linda walk away. He glances at the 
tcamera and starts to peel off his face.

<b>tINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe elevator door opens. It's empty.

tSEBASTIAN'S POV - as we push past the guard and down onto 
tthe street.

<b>tEXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tEmpty street. We hear whistling. Splashes of water splat 
tout from shallow puddles,,as Sebastian walks through 
tthem.

tSEBASTIAN'S POV - A car approaches. As it drives by we 
tsee Matt and Linda inside, heading back to the warehouse.

tThe footsteps stop.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttHmmm.

tWe see the footsteps start to head back toward the 
twarehouse.

<b>tINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tLinda and Matt exit their car and cross toward the 
televator.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttt (to Marine Guard)
tttForgot something.

<b>tINT. STREET IN FRONT OF WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tAs we watch the footsteps head back through the puddles 
ttoward the warehouse, we see Frank pass us in his car.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttWhat the hell?

tHe breaks into a run. Feet splash water and he races back 
ttoward the warehouse.

<b>tINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
tEmpty. The elevator door opens and we push out into the 
thallway. Sebastian's POV

<b>tINT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
</b>
tWe follow Sebastian down the hallway to his cubicle. But 
tas he rounds the corner, he quickly ducks back. The 
tentire research team is in his cubicle. Sebastian slowly 
tapproaches and watches as Frank takes down his video 
tboard.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttPretty clever really. All it does is 
tttrecycle the signal. He flips this 
tttswitch, it takes a snapshot and that's 
tttall we see.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttAsshole.

<b>ttttJANICE
</b>tttAnd you think he's violent?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttHe killed a dog with his bare hands.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttDogs aren't people. Are we in any 
tttdanger?

tLinda doesn't know.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttEither way, we aren't equipped to 
ttthandle this. We have to inform the 
tttcommittee.

tEverybody murmurs in agreement.

<b>ttttJANICE
</b>tttWhat if he doesn't come back?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttThey'll go after him.
tttt (beat)
tttWho has tonight's shift?

<b>ttttJANICE
</b>tttI do.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttPretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just 
tttdo what you're doing so he doesn't 
tttbecome suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll 
tttgo tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot

tSebastian's POV - He backs away and races down the hall.

<b>tEXT. DR. KRAMER'S HOUSE - POTOMAC MD - NIGHT
</b>
tThe stately stone house sits on a finely manicured lawn 
tin one of the nicest neighborhoods in town. Linda's car 
tis parked on the curb in front.

tWe break from a typical establishing shot and as the 
tCAMERA tracks closer to the house, we realize that we are

<b>tSEBASTIAN'S POV
</b>
tWe hear breathing and footsteps as we push through some 
tbushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the 
tKramer living room.

tThrough the glass we see LINDA and MATT seated across 
tfrom DR. KRAMER. We can't hear what they're saying but it 
tcertainly looks serious. Kramer puffs on a pipe and 
tstrokes his beard, shaking his head.

tKramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt, and 
tthe three of them head toward the front door.

tWe move away from the window and track toward the front 
tdoor. As the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of 
tthe conversation.

<b>ttttKRAMER
</b>tttI'll call General Caster right now and 
tttconvene the oversight committee 
ttttomorrow.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttThank you, sir.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWhat do we do in the meantime?

<b>ttttKRAMER
</b>tttJust sit tight and wait for my call. 

tMatt and Linda head down to her car. Kramer heads back 
tinside.

<b>tINT. KRAMER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tKramer heads back into the living room. His wife appears 
ta the upstairs railing.

<b>ttttMRS. KRAMER
</b>tttWhat was that about?

<b>ttttKRAMER
</b>tttJust a little trouble at work.

<b>ttttMRS. KRAMER
</b>tttYou coming up?

<b>ttttKRAMER
</b>tttIn a minute. I have to make a few 
tttcalls.

tMrs. Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr. Kramer 
tcrosses over to the telephone. He picks up the receiver 
tand starts dialing. In the middle of dialing, the phone 
tgoes dead. He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to 
tget a dial tone. Nothing. He checks the connections on 
tthe phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. The 
tline's plugged in. Weird. He hears a door creak open in 
tthe kitchen.

ttttKRAMER (cont'd)
tttHello? Hello?

tKramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. The kitchen door 
tleading to the backyard is open. Puzzled, he crosses to 
tit. A wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling 
tdead leaves in small twists of wind. The windchime rings 
tlightly. Kramer steps out.

<b>tEXT. POOL/PATIO, BACKYARD - NIGHT
</b>
tIn the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to 
tthe telephone- box against the back of the house. It Is 
topen and several of the wires have been pulled. He looks 
taround, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his 
tpipe. For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is 
tvisible in the smoke. Kramer jumps back in surprise and 
tthe pipe drops from his mouth. He gives a small sharp 
tcry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and 
this cries are stifled. In the darkness, we can make out 
this form writhing as if possessed. The struggle continues 
ta beat until Kramer manages to break free.

<b>ttttKRAMER
</b>tttHelp! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!

tAs Kramer runs, he looks behind him. But no one's there. 
tWHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling 
tinto the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one 
tsplash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped 
tAIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And 
tbecause of the water displacement, we can clearly see two 
tarms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface. 

tMARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at 
tthe pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his 
tflailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around 
thim. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails 
tfor a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A 
tmoment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR 
tPOCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the 
tpool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of 
twater. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall 
tuntil all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of 
ttiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the 
tlight like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape 
tdisappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha 
temerges from the house and sees her husband floating face 
tdown in the pool. She screams.

</b>tttHe's probably meeting with the

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWhat happened?

tLinda lowers the body to the floor.

</b>tttShe was strangled. Multiple blows to

tttWe got a big problem here.

tA lamp tumbles from the desk and smashes to the floor. 
tBoth Linda and Matt jump. Linda frantically dons the 
tthermal visor and scopes the room again. Nothing. Matt 
tnotices the lamp cord beneath Linda's leg. Points it out 
tto her. She sighs with relief... she pulled the lamp off 
tthe table.

ttttLINDA (cont'd)
tttGet everybody to the conference room.

tMatt and Linda head toward the lab.

tLinda suddenly stops.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWhat?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttShhh.

tLinda takes a few cautious steps. Senses something.

ttttLINDA (cont'd)
tttGive me the visor.

tMatt, suddenly concerned, hands her the visor. 

tTHERMAL POV - Linda checks out the corridor. Empty. Linda 
ttakes Matt's hand.

ttttLINDA (cont'd)
tttC'mon.

tThey move quickly up the corridor. See Frank, Sarah and

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttThe man has checked out of reality.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttWhat happened? I don't understand.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttIsn't it obvious? Right now, we're the

tttbecomes the most powerful man on

</b>tttHe wasn't. He is now.

</b>tttCan you fix the elevator? Restore our

</b>tttSo what do we do until then. Sit

tEveryone looks around for some leadership. Finally.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttNo. We find him, before he finds us.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR - DAY

tThe group moves quickly, passing under an air vent. As

<b>tINT. OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
tAs they enter...

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttYou sure this'll work.

tLinda sits down at a computer terminal, activates it.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWe designed it to help find the rats

tttwere too small for thermal scans.

tA map of the compound appears on the screen.

tMatt toggles a switch. Linda stares at a map of the

</b>tttI've got movement in Corridor Six.

<b>ttttMATT

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttLet's do it.

tttIf we split up, can we trap him on

</b>tttGoing Thermal.

tMatt pulls the visor down over his eyes.

<b>tINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
tLinda watches the two separate and come around Sebastian 
tin a pincer move.

tSuddenly, the blip that was Sebastian disappears. Linda 
tgrabs the walkie.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttI lost him. Matt, I lost him.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
tMatt makes his way forward.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttHe probably just stopped moving.

tBut Matt becomes more cautious with his footsteps. Slowly 
t... approaching a corner...

tHe rounds the corner and sees a heat signature at the far 
tend of the corridor. He levels his pistol, ready to fire.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttIt's me.

tMatt pulls off his goggles.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttDo you have anything?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttNothing.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttHow did he get by us?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttHe couldn't.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttSebastian! We're here to help. 
tttSebastian.

tNo response. They both don their visors and move forward 
tslightly. Carter holds up his hand.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttThere. Behind those pipes. He's not 
tttmoving.

tCarter points. Matt checks his thermal. A red heat

tttDoctor Caine?
tttt (beat)
tttCan you hear me?

tNo response.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttt (into walkie)
tttWe see him. But he's not responding. 
tttThe heat signature doesn't move.

tMatt looks through his visor and holds the tranquilizer 
tgun at the ready. He looks for a clear shot. The heat 
tsignature huddles behind pipes.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttC'mon... C'mon...

tThe two slowly move closer. Matt finally has a clear 
tshot. He signals Carter. Carter levels his pistol too.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttCovered.

tMatt fires the dart at the heat signature. It bounces off 
tthe wall ... Nothing there. 

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWhat the...

tHe crosses to the heat signature.

tttJust a vent. Just a goddamn vent

<b>ttttLINDA (V.0.)
</b>tttHe was there.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttLooks like... looks like we're pumping

tSuddenly behind him... CARTER JERKS THREE FEET in the

tgasps for air.

<b>ttttLINDA (V.0.)
</b>tttI got movement again! He's right on

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttNo fucking shit!

tMatt opens fire with the tranquilize, shooting at the

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttSebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>tttt (choking)
tttH...Help... MMmmphg

tCarter suffocates. He passes out. With a sudden crack, 
the's thrown against the side wall. A large cut opens up 
tacross his head and his body goes limp.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttt (into walkie)
tttWhere is he? Where the fuck is he?!?

<b>tINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
tLinda huddles over the display.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttRight on top of you.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
tMatt scrambles away. Running. Pipes burst and swing down 
tfrom the ceiling. Steam billows forth. Something moves 
tthrough the cloud of steam.

tAround the corner, Matt shoves more darts into his 
ttranquilizer.

<b>ttttLINDA (V.0.)
</b>tttWhat's going on? Are you okay?

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttCarter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from

tquickly.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttMatt, he's coming toward you.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
tMatt takes a few steps back.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttShit.

</b>tttGot outta there.

tMatt breaks into a run.

<b>tINT. OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
tLinda watches one dot chasing the other, down several 
tcorridors.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttHe's close!

<b>tINT. TUNNEL
</b>
tMatt running, checking over his shoulder. Sounds of 
tfootsteps behind him, but up ahead the heavy metal blast 
tdoors begin to close.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttGoddamnit. The doors are closing. He's 
tttshutting me in.

tMatt rushes the doors as they slide shut. He doesn't make 
tit in time. The doors close with a resounding clang. Matt 
tturns and pulls on his thermals.

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttWhere is he?

<b>tINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tLinda huddled over the screen. Tense.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttHe's coming right at you! 

tThen checks the Thermal goggles. Several heat signature 
tdot the tunnel.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWhere?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttTwenty, maybe thirty feet.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttGoddamnit, I got thermals all over the 
tttplace. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must 
tttbe ghosts.

<b>tINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tLinda gets a sense of forboding. She looks around the 
troom. Sees a heating vent in the corner.

tBeat.

tShe grabs the walkie.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttThose signatures ... they're coming 
tttfrom the heating vents. 

tThrough the goggles, Matt sees the tunnel turning red.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttI'm starting to lose resolution on my

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttGet out of there!

<b>tINT. OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttIf the room temperature is the same as

tLinda grabs a Tranq gun and heads for the door. 

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttI'm going!

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttLinda...it's not safe.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttThat's why I'm going.

tttCorridor eight is clear. Get Carter to

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttBut...

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttDo it.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR
</b>
tMatt turns to face the corridor. It's turning red. Matt 
tsees some movement in the thermal cloud. Opens fire. But 
tthe thermal signature disappears into the heat. Matt 
tcan't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore. 
tHe pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him 
tsweeping the hallway.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttMarco...Polo... Marco... Polo...

tHis voice keeps shifting. Matt fires.

ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
tttNot even close.

tMatt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind 
tman using a cane. But his foot isn't hitting anything. He 
tsees a FIRE EXTINGUISHER mounted on the wall. He rushes 
tit, turns it on the hallway and sprays. And SOMETHING 
tLUNGES through the foam. GRABS HIM, sending him tumbling 
tdown the tunnel. Matt is thrown against the wall. Blood 
tcoming from his brow. He scrambles away, spraying more 
tfoam. Sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and 
tFIRES. The shape leaps away. The DART FLIES. Doesn't hit. 
tMatt scrambles back into a corner. His pistol is empty.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttSo... just out of curiosity, how long 
ttthas my best friend been fucking my ex-

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttSebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttShe's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she?

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttCalm down, Sebastian... we can talk 
tttthis through. It's not too late.

tThe Shape parts the low hanging mist, the fine powder 
tswirling in clouds behind it. Coming toward him.

<b>ttttMATT (CONT'D)
</b>tttC'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttI'm sorry, but I just feel that our

tTHE DOOR OPENS. Linda reaches through, grabs Matt. She 
tpulls him to his feet and through the door.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL
</b>
tFrank and Sarah, holding their Tranq pistols, fly down 
tthe corridor.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttThis way.

tThey shear off the main corridor into the side corridor. 
tCarter lies crumpled up ahead. Sarah slides to his side. 
tCarter's head rests in a pool of blood. She checks his 
tpulse while Frank takes a protective position.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttPulse is weak. Breathing... shallow.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttHe'll be okay.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttIt's pretty severe. We have to get him 
tttto the lab.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttHe's got to be okay.

tFrank stands frozen.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttFor godsakes, help me.

tFrank snaps to. Grabs an arm. The pair hoist Carter up 
tand carry him down the hallway.

<b>tINT. OBSERVATION ROOM
</b>
tLinda pulls a handle and doors slide shut behind them.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttHe was going to kill me.

tLinda pulls him close.

</b>tttI know. He's gone.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWe've got to got out of here.

tLinda checks the screen -- see Sarah, Frank and Carter 
theaded toward the Laboratory.

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttWhere is he? Goddamnit, where is he? 

tIsolated in the Hallway of Habitats is a single blip.

</b>tttHabitats.

</b>tttOh god. That's right between us and 
tttthe lab.

<b>tINT. LABORATORY
</b>
tFrank and Sarah lift Carter onto a medical table.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttHe's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold 
tttthis.

tShe guides Frank's hands to the wound.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttKeep applying pressure.

tSarah pulls out a saline solution I.V. bag and slap it on 
tthe rack. She fumbles with the needle as she tries to 
tfind a vein.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttDon't move your hand until I got back. 

tSarah heads to the door.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tttWhere are you going?

</b>tttBut...

tSarah exits the lab. Checks the corridor. Down at the end 
tof the cramped tunnel is the supply room.

tShe swallows her fear and heads toward it, all the while 
tglancing side-to-side and behind her.

<b>tINT. SUPPLY ROOM
</b>
tSpooked, Sarah bursts into the room. She goes to the 
tsupply fridge/freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts 
tthrough blood bags.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL
</b>
tMatt and Linda push along the corridor; Matt spraying 
twith the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts, 
tLinda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando.

tA noise behind them. Footsteps.

tMatt turns to blast with the extinguisher. The white 
tchemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the 
ttunnel. But it isn't a human shape.

tMatt's uniform shreds. Something with fierce sharp claws 
tfells him. Tearing into his flesh. We see a angry, hungry 
tface... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttAhh!  Shit!

tLinda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke. 
tMatt trips and goes sprawling. Something yelps. A howl. 
tLinda shoots. Her dart jabs into something which 
tcollapses to the ground. A moment of calm. As the dusty 
tchemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape 
tappears, still twitching.

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttKarl Three. Nice shot.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttHe's let the animals out. It wasn't

tLinda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq 
tgun at the ready. The heat is getting to bar. Bar scrubs 
tare soaked, her hair's a mess. She wipes the sweat from 
ther brow.

ttttLINDA (cont'd)
tttYou okay?

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttIt won't kill me unless it gets 
tttinfected. You?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttMe .... Don't ask about me. If he 
tttfreed all the animals, we could have 
tttdozens running around the lab.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttSo he could be anywhere right now.

tMatt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud 
tmist. Nothing else appears.

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttWhat do we do?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttGet to the lab, lock the goddamn doors 
tttand pray to God Frank can reprogram 
tttthe elevator.

<b>tINT. SUPPLY ROOM
</b>
tSarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door 
tto the fridge/freezer.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttFrank?

tShe eyes the supply room, looking for a sign of movement.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttt (frightened whisper)
tttWho's there?

tShe listens. Is that breathing she hears? Now she's 
tstarting to panic.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttDr. Caine?

tShe starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. 
tShe clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to 
taim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an 
tidea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the 
tfloor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the 
tlinoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming 
tmore and more hysterical. Splattering more and more 
tblood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she 
tsearches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. 
tBut there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching 
tthe tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer.

tFinally she relaxes. It was just her imagination. She 
theads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper 
tin her ear.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttYou missed.

tHer hair flies up, and she swings against the wall. She 
ttries to move, but she's pinned there. Her hands 
tstruggling against the force.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttPlease no. Let me go. Oh god, let me 
tttgo. 

tThe arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttWhat are you doing? No!

tSarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttHelp me! Oh God. Somebody help me!
<b>tttFRANK!
</b>
tSlowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and 
taround, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her 
tstomach.

tSarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttNo... please. Don't do this to me.

tShe struggles, shaking back and forth. Writhing. In 
tanguish and in fear.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
tttWhat do you want?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYou.

tThe trigger pulls .... Pop!

tA dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's 
tstomach. She whimpers as her eyes glass over. Suddenly 
tshe's released. She stumbles backward and falls lifeless 
tto the floor. A moment of stillness, all we can hear is 
tthe sound of someone breathing.

tOn Sarah's face... a slight-indentation runs down her 
tcheek..

tAlmost sweet... almost tender. And slight indentation 
truns across her breast and strokes down her body. The 
tsense of violation and vulnerability is awful. Sebastian 
tsighs.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttI've always liked your feistiness. 

tSarah's head shifts slightly. Her head shifts violently, 
taccompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping. 
tSebastian exhales, his breath filled with the 
tintoxication of power.

tttGoddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you

tNo response. Frank doesn't know whether to stay or go

tThey identify the general area the voice is coming from:

tSebastian TOGGLES the intercom switch OFF. We pan over to

tstride down the hallway. The chair swivels and the

tLinda still holds his tranq gun toward the door. Nothing

tThen she sees it. The little red light on the intercom. 
tIts on.

</b>tttJesus!

tLinda rushes over and slams into Matt. They fall to the

tback and her lips erupt with blood.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN'S VOICE
</b>tttFigured it out? You were always so

tMatt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his

twatches him being pulled away.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttNo!

tShe clamors over to him. But Matt rises in the air and is 
ttossed against the lab table. Linda levels her dart

tfor cover. Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to 
ther.

tLinda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer. She 
tnavigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack 
tof light at the front door.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttHow can you be so brutal?

tLinda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place.

tLinda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor. She falls 
tto her knees beside Matt, lying on the ground.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttMatt... Matthew. Stay with me now.

</b>tttShhh. Don't talk.

taround the room and sees the storage freezer.

ttttLINDA (cont'd)
tttWe gotta move. Hang on.

tLinda helps Matt up and into the storage freezer.

<b>tINT. STORAGE FREEZER

tLinda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks

tnext to Matt.

</b>tttLin...

tHe entire shirt is stained with blood. He's having

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttI can't feel anything.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttYou feel that?

tMatt smiles.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttA little...

tShe rips his shirt open... and sees his wounds. She grabs 
ta vial of alcohol and dumps it on her hands and then

</b>tttYour losing blood, but he didn't hit

tShe looks around.

ttttLINDA (cont'd)
tttSutures and thread.

tShe rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room. 
tSuddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face. She 
tstumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda 
tscrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place. 
tSebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no 
tavail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The 
tdoor stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly.  Still. 
tThen she hears the click of the door locking.

tCLOSE ON THE REGULATOR as the dial turns from forty-five 
tdegrees, down to negative twenty.

<b>tINSIDE THE FREEZER
</b>
tThrough the porthole, Linda sees the bloody footprints 
theading toward the door. She removes the metal bar and 
tpushes on the door. It won't move.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttGoddamnit.

tLinda looks around the storage room. She grabs a roll of 
tduct tape and pulls off a length.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttWhat're you doing?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttThis is temporary.

tShe takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound. She 
ttapes it, using duct tape.

tttYou still with me?

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttBarely.

tA beat later, the compressor begins pumping Arctic air

tLinda returns to the door. Shakes it.

<b>tINT. CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
tWe hear WHISTLING as we see a sheet of flesh fill out

<b>tINT. STORAGE FREEZER

tLinda continues shaking the door. The lock holds. A tear 
trolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens. 
tThe tear drops freeze. Linda shivers as she pulls the icy 
ttears from her face.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttOh shit.

tThe inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees.

tLinda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against 
tthe porthole. The metal bar just bounces off the glass.

<b>tINT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

tA drawer opens, revealing a set of clothing neatly

</b>tttThey say freezing to death isn't so

tMatt's head rolls back.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttMatt! MATT!

tShe checks his pulse. Thank god he still has one, but 
the's not gonna last long. They're both already starting 
tto turn a little blue. Linda stares desperately up at the 
tshelves, trying to find some sort of advantage. Then she 
tsees something. She looks back at the door lock and then 
tshe rises ... and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the 
tshelf.

ttttLINDA (cont'd)
tttWe're not dying in here.


<b>tINT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
tSebastian, dressed in street clothes, stands before the 
tmirror applying make-up to his latex mask.

<b>tINT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
tLinda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric 
tcord. 

tShe grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold 
tfingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out 
tthe plastic tube.

tShe finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the 
tstripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil.

<b>tINT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
tSebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in 
tthe mirror. Pretty smooth. Even from relatively close up, 
the could pass as normal.

<b>tINT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
tLinda furiously winds wire into a coil.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR
</b>
tSebastian heads down the corridor. Lingering steam twists 
tin and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils. Sebastian 
tpauses for a moment, hearing A GROWL. Suddenly the 
thallway seems a lot scarier. From beneath his scrubs he 
tpulls his own tranq gun. He listens ... hearing scraping 
tand footsteps. Watching the water on the floor twitch. 
tWith machine like precision, he turns and fires. The 
ttranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing 
ttumbles over.

tSebastian continues down the hallway.

<b>tINT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
tLinda holds the plug end of the extension cord. The other 
tend is wrapped into a tight long coil. Linda looks for an 
toutlet, but can't find one. She looks at the overhead 
tlights.

tA moment later she's climbing up the shelving. She wrap* 
ta piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch 
tshe smashes one of the overhead light bulbs.

<b>tINT. LABORATORY
</b>
tSebastian enters, fully dressed. At a distance it'd be 
thard to tell his secret. He pulls several chemicals off 
tthe shelves. Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and 
tbegins mixing.

<b>tINT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
tLinda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to 
tthe lightbulb, socket. 
tSuddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies 
tagainst the nearest metal surface. She's made an 
telectromagnet.

<b>tINT. LABORATORY
</b>
tSebastian loads the filled test tubes into the 
tcentrifuge. Dozens of other vials are already slotted. He 
ttakes one of the left over vials, considers it a moment 
tand then flings it over to the other side of the lab. The 
tvial shatters and...

<b>tEXPLODES.
</b>
tA powerful explosion that rocks the room.

<b>tINT. STORAGE FREEZER
</b>
tLinda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up 
tagainst the door. The magnet attaches itself. Linda 
tshakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move.

<b>tOUTSIDE THE DOOR -
</b>
tWe see the lock twitching. Shaking...

<b>tINSIDE THE DOOR -
</b>
tLinda shivers as she plays with the coil. Her eyes glaze 
tand she stumbles backward. Her surgical scrubs, once 
tsoaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff. She composes 
therself and pushes back toward the door. Her heavy breath 
thangs as a low cloud of Mist.

<b>tINT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
tSebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes, 
tcalculating their combined power in his mind. Then he 
tcloses the top of the centrifuge. He taps a few commands 
tinto its timer.

<b>tINT. SUPPLY ROOM
</b>
tThe door lock twitches again and twists back. The door 
tswings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a 
tsupply shelf of oxygen canisters. The canisters tumble 
tevery which way as Linda tumbles to the ground.

tShe scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling 
this cold body out of the storage locker.

tShe pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a 
ttrashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the 
tpaper. She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire. As she 
tdoes, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR
</b>
tSebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him. He 
theads down the darkened tunnel. Something scampers in 
tfront of him. Small, not visible. Sebastian sends it 
treeling with a swift violent kick.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR, BY THE ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
tSebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up 
tthe tunnel. He taps a code into the elevator vault doors. 
tThe vault doors open revealing the elevator.

tThe doors slide open and Sebastian steps inside.

<b>ttttELEVATOR
</b>tttAuthorization please?

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttCaine. One One One One One.

tAnd there's Linda. Slicked with dirt and blood. She holds

ttttLINDA (cont'd)
tttI can't let you leave. Come on out and 
tttI'll give you one last chance.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYou said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't 
ttthold on to the past.

tThe door starts to shut.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttAaaaaaahhhh!

tShe hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose. A 
tline of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator. 
tWWHHHOOOOSSHHHH! Sebastian goes up in flame. Linda runs 
ttoward the elevator. Just as the door's about to close, 
tshe slides. Her foot jamming into it. 
tShe lets loose with the flame again. Sebastian, backed 
tinto the corner, has no where to go. He's yelling in 
tpain. His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns. The surgical 
tscrubs SINGE BLACK. With no other escape route, he dives 
ttoward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body 
tfly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the 
ttank as Sebastian continues to burn. The elevator lights 
tflickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of 
tsparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her 
tfeet and turns to see...

tHalf of Sebastian's head MELTED AWAY, his latex facade a 
tgruesome smoke-damaged mass. His clothes are half burned 
trevealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like 
tdeformed blackened bubble wrap.

tSebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with 
tanother shot of flame.

tSebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the 
tcorner.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttOh God!

tLinda stalks toward him.

<b>ttttLINDA 
</b>tttYou wanna see God? I'll show you God. 

tLinda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex 
tand clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian, 
tlooking like some ugly creature, pushes down the 
tcorridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering 
tand cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose 
tanother jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and 
tdoesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks 
tpressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the 
tblackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he 
tpushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb 
tthemselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet 
tmoment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable 
tshe is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing. 
tBut something on the ceiling catches her attention. She 
tblasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE 
tSPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water 
tsprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the 
tdownpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes 
ttoward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs 
tLinda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand 
tsmashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor, 
tshe looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She 
tcrawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to 
ther feet and slams her against the wall.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttI'm gonna find everyone in your family 
tttand kill them-. Your sister... she 
tttnever liked me. I think I'll go after 
ttther and her little boy first. 

tSebastian smashes her head against a metal post. Her head 
tcuts open, blood dripping down.

ttttSEBASTIAN (cont'd)
tttI just wanted you to know that before 
tttyou die.

tLinda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses 
tagainst her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath. 
tBut through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see 
tsomething also... a watery smudge.

<b>tBAM!
</b>
tMATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar. Sebastian 
tslams against the corridor wall and sinks down.

tMatt staggers. It's taken all his strength to got there. 
tHe drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he 
tsinks to his knees by Linda.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttThought I'd... thought I'd save you 
tttfor a change.

tHe gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttLet's got out of here.

tJust as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar. 
tHe swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the 
tway, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The 
tconduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The 
tVOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the 
tcurrent pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His 
tblood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his 
tskeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly 
telectrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and 
tmore visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in 
tand out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
tJust outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the 
tsealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't.

tThrough the doors porthole she sees a collection of

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttNitro...

tMatt peaks inside.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttHe said it himself... All they'll find

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttIn an enclosed space, he'll wipe out

<b>tINT. TUNNEL

tLinda and Matt move as fast as they can. They reach the 
tburned out elevator. What the hell are they gonna do? We 
tknow the damn thing doesn't work. She swings her crowbar 
tat the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttGrab on.

tLinda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls 
therself up. She reaches back down for Matt.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttForget about me. You go.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttFuck you. Give me your hands.

tLinda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth. 
tShe struggles, but they both manage to got him through

tLinda and Matt are on top of the elevator.

tLinda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the

tFrom the little light below she can see a maintenance 
tladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. 
tThey look up and see it disappear into the darkness.

<b>ttttLINDA

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttI can't. I'm going to pass out.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttKeep moving.

tHe does, through sheer force of will. Blood from his

tfurther they have to go in this darkness. Light leaks in 
tfrom the maintenance hatch below.

<b>tINT. LABORATORY
</b>
tThe centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch. The

tThen... one of the vials shatters.

tA FLASH OF LIGHT. A HUGE EXPLOSION rips through the 
tlaboratory.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL
</b>
tThe EXPLOSION rips through the lab doors. A MASSIVE

tSURROUNDED BY FLAMES flying up toward them, lifted by the 
texplosion's SHOCK WAVES.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttOh God!

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttDon't look.

tThe carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster. 
tIts loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the 
twalls around the pair. Its gonna hit them! Linda pulls 
therself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. She's 
tpressed against Matt. The elevator... 50 feet... 40 ... 
t30 ... W0000000SH! It flames RIGHT BY THEM. 
tWhen Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is HUNDREDS OF 
tFEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them, closing 
tin.

<b>ttttLINDA

tPanicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares 
tdown at the rising fire wall. But the fire dissipates 
tbefore it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames 
treaches up to lick the soles of her feet.

tThey hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the

<b>tBEGINS TO FALL.
</b>
<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttIt's coming down!

tFASTER AND FASTER. Coming back toward them in complete

ttracks, SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES. Linda 
tsees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as 
tit ping-pongs toward them... smashing into the access 
tladder, smashing into the wall. The elevator slows, but 
tcontinues slamming side-to-side. Linda cringes as the 
televator crashes into the wall above them. But it jams 
tthere, stopping. They pull their heads away from wall and 
tlook up. The elevator just hangs there, suspended. 
tThere's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the 
tladder.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttC'mon. Before it slips.

tThey begins to climb up again. Matt shimmies through the 
ttight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed 
tby Linda. She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs 
tthere a moment when ... Ah! Something grabs her. A singed 
tthrobbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her 
tleg.

ttttLINDA (cont'd)
tttIt's him.

tShe kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of 
tdirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the 
tladder.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttSebastian, you fuck.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttGet off me.

tSebastian pulls himself up Linda's body. Translucent 
tdirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. Linda 
ttries to climb with this thing on her. But Sebastian 
tgrabs her around the neck. She begins choking for breath. 
tLinda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... She looks 
tdown at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... She 
tlets go!

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttNo!

tShe and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam 
tagainst the top of the elevator. Linda seems to hover a 
tfew above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below 
ther. Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. But 
tmetal groans and the elevator drops another five feet. 
tLinda struggles to her feet. Sebastian rises. A menacing 
tdark figure stalking toward her. Linda pushes back from 
thim. Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over 
tto the ladder. The elevator strains and groans.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttLet go of me.

tSebastian presses her up against the ladder. Presses into 
ther from behind. He has her trapped. His dirty hand 
treaches out and strokes her hair.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttRemember the day we met? You were 
tttwearing a red dress and you were so 
tttpretty. Now... Now look at you.

<b>ttttMATT
</b>tttGet off of her!

tSebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with 
this filthy, dirt-smeared mouth and half-burned away face.

ttttMATT (cont'd)
tttSebastian, stop it.

tLinda and Sebastian struggle. Matt reaches down to try 
tand grab her, help her.

<b>ttttSEBASTIAN
</b>tttYou fucked it all up.

tLinda looks at her feet. The last elevator emergency 
tbrake grips its cable. She grits her tooth and grabs hold 
tof the ladder.

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttGo to hell. 

tLinda stamps on the brake release. The ELEVATOR TUMBLES 
t... along with Sebastian. It slams into the fiery abyss a 
thundred yards below. Linda hangs, one hand holding onto 
tthe ladder, the other holding onto Matt. Matt pulls her 
tback onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.

<b>tEXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
tLinda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine. 
tEmergency crews close from all directions, sirens 
troaring. A trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into 
tthe sky.

tAn ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop 
tout, immediately putting a blanket around her and 
ttreating Matt's wounds.

<b>ttttMARINE GUARD
</b>tttWhat happened?

<b>ttttLINDA
</b>tttWe lived.

tLinda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin 
tand she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground... 
talmost as if something was there.

<b>ttttttttt FADE 
</b><b>OUT:
</b>
