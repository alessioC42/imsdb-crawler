<b>                               THE BACHELOR PARTY
</b><b> 
</b>                               by Paddy Chayefsky



<b>tFADE IN.
</b><b> 
</b><b>tEXTERIOR. STUYVESANT TOWN HOUSING PROJECT -- DAY.
</b>tUnder the credits, the CAMERA PANS slowly across the project, 
tcapturing the sober monotony, the endless straight apartment 
thouses. Seven o'clock in the morning.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM
</b>tThe bedroom of a two-and-a-half-room apartment in the housing 
tproject. It is early morning, but the shades are drawn and 
tthe room is dark. CAMERA moves slowly across the room, over 
tthe large double bed on which Charlie and Helen Samson, a 
tyoung couple in their late twenties, are sleeping. They are 
tsleeping more or less on their sides, facing away from each 
tother. One of Helen's pajama-clad legs projects from under 
tthe light covers. We close in on Charlie's sleeping face.
<b> 
</b>tThe alarm clock at a distant end of the room suddenly bursts 
tinto a soft relentless buzz. Charlie's eyes open. There is a 
tmuffled movement at his side, and Helen gets up on one elbow. 
tThen she sits up, rises, and pads barefooted -- a rather 
tpretty girl in rumpled pajamas -- to the alarm clock and 
tturns it off. Charlie's head turns on the pillow so that he 
tcan watch her. She pads back to the bed now and stands at the 
tfoot, looking down at her husband. She produces a smile, then 
tturns and shuffles into the bathroom where she turns on the 
twall switch. A shaft of light now pours into the bedroom.
<b> 
</b>tCharlie sits up in bed. His shoes and socks are on the floor 
tby his feet. He reaches down and starts to put them on. 
tSuddenly, from the recesses of the bathroom, Helen's rather 
tvague soprano lifts into the first lines of a popular song. 
tThen it stops as abruptly as it began. Charlie's head slowly 
tturns to look at the bathroom, back again to the business of 
tputting on his socks. His face is expressionless, but there 
tis no mistaking the sodden distaste he has for the world 
ttoday.
<b> 
</b>tHe just sits on the bed, a young man of twenty-nine, clad 
tonly in his pajama trousers, one sock dangling from his hand, 
this head hanging, his shoulders slumped. Behind him, the 
tsudden noise of rushing tap water, then off. Then his wife 
tcomes back into the bedroom. She is carrying a bath towel 
twith which she is drying her face. Finished, she drops the 
ttowel on the bed and begins to dress. A moment later, she 
tpads around the corner of the bed to Charlie's front. She 
tis still barefooted and wears her pajama top, but she has 
texchanged the trousers for a half-slip. Charlie hasn't moved 
ta muscle since the effort required to lift one sock from the 
tfloor.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttYou think it's too early to call 
ttmy mother?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI don't know.
<b> 
</b>tCharlie shrugs without looking up. Helen goes out of the 
tbedroom, into the little square of foyer where there is a 
ttelephone table with a telephone on it. She dials, waits. In 
tthe bedroom, Charlie rubs his eyes with two fingers.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttHello, Ma, did I wake you up? This 
ttis Helen.... Well, I'll be going to 
ttwork, and I wanted to get ahold of 
ttyou before I left. I called you last 
ttnight. Where were you and Pop anyway? 
ttI kept calling you every half hour 
ttup till one o'clock.... Oh, yeah? Did 
ttyou have a nice time? ...
<b> 
</b><b>tCAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN FOR CLOSEUP
</b>tof Charlie in bedroom.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN'S VOICE
</b>ttWell, listen, Ma, I got something to 
tttell you. I'm pregnant.... Yeah, 
ttpregnant.... Of course I'm sure. 
ttI've got the report back from the 
ttlaboratory.... No, you wouldn't know 
tthim, Doctor Axelrod.... Second month. 
ttHe says I can expect the baby in 
ttFebruary.... Well, Grandma, act a 
ttlittle excited, will you? ... You 
ttbet I'm excited....
<b> 
</b><b>tCLOSEUP OF CHARLIE 
</b>tHe is not excited. If anything he is miserable. His bowed 
thead rises slowly. The eyes open. He stares abstractedly 
tahead for a moment. Then he sighs a profound sigh of 
tresignation. Then his eyes close again, and his head slowly 
tsinks back to its previous abjection. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>tINTERIOR. THE KITCHEN -- HALF HOUR LATER 
</b>tHelen, dressed in skirt and blouse now, is preparing two 
tcups of instant coffee, pouring hot water from the saucepan 
tinto the two cups. The toaster is ticking. A packaged loaf 
tof white bread is open on the cupboard shelf. Finished with 
tpouring the water, Helen sets the saucepan back on the stove 
tand comes out into the dining area. The dinette table is 
tcovered from end to end by open textbooks, several very large 
taccounting worksheets on which are scrawled meticulous 
tnumbers, a ruler, several pencils and a pen, an ash tray 
tglutted with cigarettes, a cup and saucer. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(calling to the bedroom)
ttDo you need any of this or can I 
tttake them off the table? 

tCharlie appears in the bedroom doorway, dressed and washed 
tnow, a neat, clean young man in a white shirt and neatly 
tknotted tie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll clean that up in a minute.
<b> 
</b>tHe disappears back into the bedroom. Helen picks up the ash 
ttray and the cup and saucer.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttHow late were you up last night?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE'S VOICE
</b>ttAbout two.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. THE BEDROOM 
</b>tCharlie standing by the window, is picking up his keys, a 
tfew dollar bills, a comb, etc., from a chair and putting 
tthem into his trouser pockets. The blinds of the bedroom 
twindow have been opened, and the high August sun streams in, 
twhitening Charlie's face. After he has pocketed his odds and 
tends, he moves to the chest of drawers on which, among all 
tsorts of other things, there are several textbooks and an 
topened notebook. He stands a moment looking down into the 
topen notebook, his lips moving ever so little, as he commits 
tsome of his notes to memory. He turns a page of the notebook 
tback to check something and then goes back to the previous 
tpage. Now he opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest 
tof drawers. The drawer contains wisps of his wife's stockings 
tand other feminine things. He finds a small roll of bills and 
ttakes one of them, putting the bill in his pocket and closing 
tthe dresser drawer. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm taking five bucks from your 
ttdrawer. 

tHe pauses now to affix a less frowning expression onto his 
tface and goes out into the little foyer and into the dining 
tarea.

<b>tINTERIOR. THE DINING AREA
</b>tHelen is seated at the dinette table, sipping coffee and 
treading yesterday's newspaper. There are two cups of coffee 
ton the table.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttA guy in my office is getting 
ttmarried, and I got clipped four 
ttbucks for his wedding present.
<b> 
</b>tHe begins assembling the mass of papers and textbooks on the 
ttable.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttWho's getting married?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttArnold. I told you about him. The 
ttguy with the sick mother.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttOh, yeah.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(trying to decide 
tttwhether he needs a 
tttcertain worksheet) 
ttThe rest of the guys are giving him 
tta bachelor party tonight.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttDo you want to go, Charlie?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI got class tonight.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttWhat have you got -- cost accounting?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI think you ought to take off a 
ttnight. You ought to go, have a little 
ttfun for yourself. I think you need 
ttthat. You go to work all day, you go 
ttto school all night. You can miss one 
ttnight, Charlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNo, these bachelor parties get kind 
ttof wild sometimes. The whole 
ttphilosophy is: it's the groom's last 
ttnight of freedom. So it gets kind of 
ttwild sometimes.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttThat's a good philosophy to start a 
ttmarriage with.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, a bunch of guys get together, 
ttthey like to tear up the town a 
ttlittle.
<b> 
</b>tHe has assembled his notes and notebooks and texts in a pile 
ton the table, ready to take with him. He sits down and 
tbegins sipping his coffee. Helen looks back to her newspaper, 
tfrowning a little, then looks up at Charlie again.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI think you oughta go, Charlie. I 
ttknow you're upset about the baby.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm not upset about the baby.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttCome on, Charlie. I know how you 
ttfeel. Listen, you don't have to 
ttpretend you're excited about the 
ttbaby. We weren't exactly planning 
tton a baby right now ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm not upset about the baby.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttIt's a shock. I had some bad days 
ttbefore I told you. I said: "Oh, boy, 
ttthat's all we need. A baby." Then I 
ttsaid to myself: "If I'm having a 
ttbaby, I'm having a baby. That's all 
ttthere is to it." And I like the idea. 
ttWe're going to have a family, 
ttCharlie. I like the idea.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, give me a couple of days to 
ttget used to the idea. I'll be all 
ttright.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI know you will, Charlie. That's why 
ttI think you ought to go to this 
ttbachelor party tonight.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(bursting out) 
ttI don't want to go to this bachelor 
ttparty.
<b> 
</b>tHe looks down at his coffee, embarrassed at the outburst.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm sorry I yelled.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttDon't be silly.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI better get going. Kenny's probably 
ttwaiting for me now. I'm sorry I 
ttyelled like that.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttWhat are you sorry about? Don't I 
ttyell at you all the time?
<b> 
</b>tWE STAY ON HELEN, as she reads her newspaper, but there is 
ta faint frown on her face.

<b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. LOCAL PLATFORM EASTSIDE IRT SUBWAY
</b>tAn express train hurtles southward. We see it flashing by 
tthrough the concrete pillars of the subway. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tIRT EXPRESS HURTLING SOUTHWARD
</b>tCharlie and another young man, named Kenneth, are seated in 
ta crowded subway car. People are standing tightly in the 
taisles. Kenneth is an amiable young man of thirty-odd. He 
thas his jacket off and his tie loosened as a concession to 
tthe August heat. Charlie is neatly and coolly dressed. He 
thas two notebooks and a battered text in his lap. He is 
treading the text. Two young white-collar workers on their 
tway to work. They ride along silently for a moment. Kenneth 
tis rather stealthily concerned with a full-busted young 
twoman who is standing directly in front of him, holding on 
tto a strap. It is summertime, and the girls all wear light 
tsummer frocks. There is a feeling of wistful sensuality to 
tthe scene.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYou going to Arnold's bachelor party?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI don't think so, Kennie. 

<b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI got two classes tonight.

<b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah, I was going to go, but I think 
ttI better not, because my kid, the 
ttyoung one, the girl, she's been 
ttacting up again lately. She's got 
ttsome kind of allergy, the doctors 
ttdon't know what.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThese bachelor parties get kind of 
ttwild sometimes. Eddie Watkins is 
ttmaking all the arrangements. He's 
ttprobably got us lined up with a 
ttbunch of chorus girls.

<b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah, do you think so?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou know Eddie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah, boy, he really lives it up, 
ttdon't he? Did you see that blonde 
ttwho picked him up for lunch last 
ttweek? Boy, sometimes I wish I was a 
ttbachelor. Well, you know what I mean. 
ttI never seem to get out of the house 
ttany more, you know what I mean? 
ttAbout once a week, I go to the 
ttmovies. We never even see the whole 
ttpicture. My wife starts worrying 
ttabout the kids. My youngest kid, the 
ttgirl, she's got some kind of rash. 
ttWe don't know what it is. I never 
ttseem to see anybody any more. Do you 
ttknow how long it is since I've seen 
ttWillie Duff? I haven't seen Willie 
ttin about six months. My wife can't 
ttstand his wife. You ever seen her, 
ttWillie's wife?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNo, I didn't know Willie too well. 

<b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttBoy, wait'll you have kids, boy. 
ttYou'll never get out of the house.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHelen's pregnant now.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttNo kidding.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttOh, that's wonderful, Charlie, 
ttthat's wonderful! 

tThe two young husbands look down again at their hands and 
tride along silently. Kenneth sneaks a quick look up at the 
tgirl standing in front of him, and then lets his attention 
tdrift down the length of the car.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttHey, there's a guy down there, 
tttrying to pick up a girl down there.
<b> 
</b>tHe is referring to a Young Fellow who elbowed his way down 
tthrough the crowded aisle but who stopped abruptly when he 
tnoticed an attractive girl, seated about three seats down 
tfrom Kenneth. The Girl is reading a newspaper. The Young 
tFellow stares at her. The Girl, aware of this sudden 
tattention, looks briefly up from her newspaper. The Young 
tFellow smiles pleasantly. The Girl, with a show of 
tannoyance, looks back to her newspaper.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttWere you with us about eight years 
ttago when I picked up that chick in 
ttfront of the bus stop in Paterson, 
ttNew Jersey?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhen was this?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah, you were there. You were with 
ttthat girl from Brooklyn. We just 
ttcame from Palisades Amusement Park, 
ttand we were driving Frankie Klein's 
ttgirl home, and the car broke down 
ttright in the middle of Route One.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(beginning to laugh) 
ttOh, yeah.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(laughing) 
ttAnd Frankie opened up the hood and 
ttthe water cap blew right up in the 
ttair.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAnd the cop came over ... 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttThat's right, the cop. He thought 
ttFrankie shot off a gun....
<b> 
</b>tThey are both laughing audibly now at the memory.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttHe was going to pull us all in. Oh, 
ttman!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttFrankie, he was funny.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttOh, that was a lot of fun, those 
ttdays.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah, they were.
<b> 
</b>tThe little spasm of laughter is over. A sort of ruefulness 
tsettles down on the two young husbands. Kenneth looks lazily 
tdown the aisle to see how the Young Fellow is making out 
twith The Girl. He seems to be making out all right. They are 
tlooking steadily at each other now. Kenneth turns back to 
tCharlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttHey, this guy's making out all right. 
ttShe's giving him the eye now.

tCharlie leans forward to see this progress.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(looking out the 
tttwindow at the passing 
tttlocal station) 
ttWhere are we now, Prince Street? I 
ttbet you he picks her up before we 
tthit Chambers Street.
<b> 
</b>tSomehow this has a sobering effect on the two young husbands. 
tAgain they sit silently as the train buckets along.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBoy, I'm bushed today. I was up till 
tttwo o'clock last night on this thing 
tthere. I'm getting to be a nervous 
ttwreck. I snarled at Helen this 
ttmorning. I think this whole night 
ttschool business is getting me down. 

<b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttI don't see how you do it.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNeither do I. I thought I was 
ttthrough with it. The plan was for me 
ttto quit work and go to college full 
tttime and cram through in a year or 
ttso. But now we got this kid coming, 
ttand Helen's going to have to quit 
tther job, and that sets me back where 
ttI started from. Another five years 
ttof this, summers included.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttI couldn't do it, man, I'll tell you 
ttthat. I wish I could, but I couldn't.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOh, what am I griping about? This is 
ttthe life I picked out for myself. 
ttBut it's a grind, boy, I tell you. 

tThey sit silently again. The train hurtles along and then 
tsuddenly slows as it approaches a stop. There is a rustle of 
tmovement among the passengers in the subway car. A few 
tpeople start edging toward the doors. The Girl reading the 
tnewspaper now folds her newspaper and stands almost directly 
tin the Young Fellow's face. They regard each other.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttYOUNG FELLOW
</b>ttt(to the girl)
ttExcuse me, can you tell me how to 
ttget to the Nassau Street exit?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttWell ... well, at the top of the 
ttstairs, you'll see all the signs.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttYOUNG FELLOW
</b>ttAre you getting off here?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttYes.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttYOUNG FELLOW
</b>ttWell, I'll follow you then. That'll 
ttbe easier, if you don't mind.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttNo, not at all.
<b> 
</b>tThey start to crowd down the aisle. The train is chugging 
tinto the Chambers Street station, and we can see the 
tyellowed lights of the platform and the quick blur of faces. 
tThe two young husbands, who had been following the byplay 
tbetween The Girl and the Young Fellow, now watch them slowly 
texit. There is an expression of poignant wistfulness on both 
ttheir faces.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>tEXTERIOR. THE OFFICE
</b>tWe look down on the bookkeeping department of a life 
tinsurance company in downtown Manhattan area around Pine 
tStreet. It is a fairly large room, large enough to hold 
televen desks. But you get the feeling that this is one of 
tthe smaller offices on the floor. You get the feeling that 
tthis company occupies three or four floors of this building. 
tDespite the size of the office, it has a cluttered look. 
tEach desk has piles of paper on it, and all the impedimenta 
tof the bookkeeper -- the pens and pencils, the adding 
tmachine, the telephone. Some of the desks have typewriters. 
tAlong the walls there are rows of filing cabinets and wall 
tbins stocked with large worksheets and thick ledgers. At 
tthe far end of the room, there is a row of windows, but it 
tis still necessary to keep the overhead fluorescent lights 
ton all day. They are on now. There are two middle-aged 
twomen standing, murmuring to each other, and a rather 
theavy-set balding man in his late forties, sitting at a 
tdesk in his shirt sleeves, already hard at work, although 
tit is still ten minutes shy of eight-thirty.
<b> 
</b>tKenneth and Charlie enter. Ad lib hellos between them and 
tthe two middle-aged women. Charlie moves to the coat rack to 
thang up his jacket, drops off his books on his desk, starts 
tfor the coat rack. Behind Charlie, we see Kenneth, carrying 
this jacket, moving to his desk, up where the middle-aged man 
tis working.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttHiya, Walter.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHiya, Walter.
<b> 
</b>tWalter, the middle-aged man, nods his good mornings.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(poking in his desk 
tttdrawer; amiably) 
ttWalter, what time do you come in in 
ttthe mornings? You're making us all 
ttlook lousy, you know that? I get 
ttthe feeling sometimes, you stay here 
ttovernight. 

tWalter merely nods, doesn't bother to look up from the work. 
tKenneth finds a stick of gum in his drawer, unwraps it. Two 
tmore women, gray-haired and bespectacled, come into the 
toffice. There is an ad lib mumble of hellos in background. 
tCharlie hangs up his jacket on the coat rack.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttArnold in yet?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHe starts his vacation today. He's 
ttgetting married Sunday, you know.
<b> 
</b>tCLOSEUP of Charlie looking out the window into the bright 
tAugust morning. His face is just a little ruffled by a 
tfrown, and there is a kind of pain in his eyes. Behind him, 
tWalter and Kenneth.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(a nervous, anxious man) 
ttWell, the doctor was over last night. 
ttBrought over the X rays; brought 
ttover the allergy tests. Brought over 
tta bill for sixty-eight dollars.  I 
ttsaid to him: "Doctor, you're a young 
ttman, professional, highly educated, 
ttfour years of college, two years of 
ttpremedical training, several years 
ttof interning, of residency. If 
ttyou're so smart, how can you charge 
ttme sixty-eight dollars? One thing 
ttthey apparently didn't teach you in 
ttmedical school. You can't get blood 
ttfrom a stone."
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttSo what's wrong with you, Walter?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat's wrong? I have to go to 
ttArizona, that's what's wrong. I have 
ttasthma. When I was a kid, they 
ttcalled it hay fever, and you carried
tta bag around your neck. Asafetida. 
ttNow, they call it asthma, and you 
tthave to go to Arizona. I said to him: 
tt"Doctor, you're a professional man, 
ttfour years of college, premedical 
ttschool, Bellevue, several diplomas. 
ttAnswer me a question. Who's going to 
ttpay for Arizona?" I said to him: 
tt"Doctor," I said, "perhaps you have 
ttthe illusion I am the Aga Khan. I 
tthave a bearing about me, perhaps, 
ttthat misleads you to believe I have 
ttblood ties with the Whitneys and the 
ttRockefellers. This isn't true." 
ttArizona. Did you ever hear of such 
ttnonsense?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttHow serious is it, Walter?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttSerious. Nothing serious. I have hay 
ttfever, I sneeze a couple of times. 
ttThe idiot told my wife I have to go 
ttto Arizona, and she wouldn't leave 
ttme alone all night. She's already 
ttpacking the bags. I said: "For 
ttheaven's sakes, you listen to 
ttdoctors, we'll all be dead." My son, 
ttHarold, believe me, he's going to be 
tta doctor. That's some racket, boy. 
ttSixty-eight dollars.
<b> 
</b>tCLOSEUP of Charlie, still at the window, when a bell 
tsuddenly clangs, indicating the start of the workday. The 
tsudden jangle makes him start, and he closes his eyes 
tbriefly against the noise.  Walter, in background, who had 
trisen and was bent over Kenneth's desk, darts nervously back 
tto his own desk.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYou better get to work. Hey, Charlie, 
ttthat was the bell. I think Flaherty 
ttis here this morning. We'll all be 
ttfired today. I have a feeling.
<b> 
</b>tHe hunches over his ledgers again, his anxious, harried face 
tdrawn into intense wrinkles of concentration. Several other 
twomen have come into the office by now, and there is a 
tgeneral movement to the desks. There is the click of a 
ttypewriter, and Walter runs his fingers glibly over the 
tadding machine on his desk. The day has started.
<b> 
</b>tAfter a moment, Charlie turns from the window and comes back 
tto his desk, sinks down onto his chair.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>tINTERIOR. THE OFFICE -- TWENTY MINUTES LATER
</b>tWe look down on the bookkeeping department. All the desks 
tare occupied but two. There are six women and our three men. 
tThe office is silent with industry, everybody's head bent 
tover his desk. There is the occasional punctuation of an 
tadding machine or a typewriter or a phone ringing.
<b> 
</b>tOur three men are bent over their tally sheets, worksheets, 
tand ledgers, occasionally reaching up to quickly tabulate 
tsomething on the adding machine. After a moment, Walter says:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(without looking 
tttup from his work) 
ttYou fellows going to Arnold's party 
tttonight? 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(without looking up) 
ttNo, I'm not going, are you?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttNo. Eddie already hooked me for four 
ttbucks for Arnold's present. This 
ttdinner is going to cost another 
ttcouple of good dollars.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt looks like nobody's going to 
ttArnold's bachelor party.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYou ain't going?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNo, I'm not going. 

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttEddie's going to be mad. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI told Eddie last week I couldn't 
ttmake it. I've got school. Eddie's a 
ttbachelor. It's all right for him to 
ttgo rooting around town, picking up 
ttgirls.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah, you get married you give that 
ttkind of thing up.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah, Charlie says Eddie has a whole 
ttbunch of chorus girls lined up for 
ttus tonight.
<b> 
</b>tWalter's head comes up for the first time.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttNo kidding. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI didn't say that. I just said that 
ttif I knew Eddie, we'd probably wind 
ttup with some of his crazy girl 
ttfriends. 

tWalter looks back down to his work again. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttI don't know where he gets all these 
ttgirls. He's a screwy looking jerk.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDid you see that blonde who was up 
tthere looking for him last week?

<b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah. He told me she was a 
tttelevision actress. I think I saw 
tther once on "Studio One." She was in 
tta coal mine with some stir-crazy 
ttcoalminer who was trying to strangle 
tther with a necktie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI'd like to strangle her with a 
ttnecktie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttNow, Walter, an old married man like 
ttyou, with asthma and everything.
<b> 
</b>tWalter looks up suddenly from his work, a strange sting of 
tpain crossing his face.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI get real jealous of Eddie 
ttsometimes. He's as free as a bird. 
ttDid you see that convertible he's 
ttgot?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah, he really banged it up I hear.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYou ought to see the old heap I've 
ttgot. He walks out of here on payday, 
tthe can spend the whole works on 
tthaving himself a good time. I walk 
ttout of here, and I got three kids 
ttand a wife, all of them with their 
ttpalms out. I lost two bucks playing 
ttpoker at my house last week. It was 
ttan economic catastrophe. My wife 
ttdidn't sleep all night.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHe's late again.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHe'll be twenty minutes late again. 
ttIf Flaherty walked in now, he'd fire 
tthim. If that ever happened to me, I 
ttthink I'd kill myself. What does 
ttEddie care? So he scrambles around 
ttfor another job. Flaherty told me 
ttlast week I had too many days off. 
ttI told him I was sick in bed. What 
ttdo you want me to do?
<b> 
</b>tHe turns back again to his work, his face creased with 
tanxiety. The three men work silently for a moment. Then the 
toffice door opens, and a man of about thirty-five, a little 
tstout, but rather casual in his dress, wearing steel-rimmed 
tglasses, enters. This is Eddie Watkins, the office bachelor. 
tHe seems to have had very little sleep the night before. His 
teyes, behind the wire-rimmed glasses, are heavy-lidded. A 
tcigarette dangles listlessly, from his mouth. There is 
tsomething of the bacchanalian libertine about Eddie. There 
tis a perfunctory exchange of hellos and good mornings, 
testablishing that this is Eddie. He shuffles with ineffable 
tweariness to his desk.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHi, Eddie, you're early today, only 
tttwenty minutes late, what happened?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(muttering through 
tttreluctant lips) 
ttFlaherty come in yet?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttNo.
<b> 
</b>tEddie sits down at his desk, pulls his cigarette 
tautomatically for a moment. Then he reaches over to a pile 
tof telephone directories on the floor beside his desk, pulls 
tup the Manhattan one, flips through the pages, finding the 
tnumber he wants. He picks up the phone. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttMary, give me an outside line....
ttt(he pauses, checks 
tttthe number in the 
tttphone book again, 
tttdials, waits) 
ttHello, is this Leathercraft on 
ttMadison Avenue? ... This is Mr. 
ttWatkins. I was in about a week ago. 
ttI ordered a military set and a 
ttwallet. They were supposed to be 
ttready yesterday.... Yes, please, 
ttwould you? ... 
ttt(he is searching 
ttthis pockets while 
ttthe waits, finds a 
tttpiece of paper, 
tttpulls it out) 
ttYeah, a military set and a wallet....
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttIs that what we bought poor Arnold?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttThat's right. The following 
ttinscriptions should be on them:
ttt(reads from the paper) 
ttOn the military set: "To Arnold: 
ttBest wishes on your marriage from 
ttAlice, Charlie, Eddie, Evelyn, 
ttJeanette with two t's, Kenneth, 
ttLucy, Mary, Olga, Walter, and 
ttFlaherty." Now on the wallet ... 
ttYeah, what? .... Yeah, that's right 
tt-- Flaherty. Now, on the wallet, 
ttthe following inscription: "To my 
ttBest Friend Arnold from his Best Man 
ttEddie." ... No, to my best friend 
ttArnold. ... That's right. "From his 
ttbest man Eddie" ... Now, can I come 
ttin at lunch and pick them up? ... 

tA young woman comes into the office, goes to Walter's desk 
tand drops some papers before him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat's this, Jeanette?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttIt's from finance, don't ask me.
<b> 
</b>tThis is the girl in the office who goes to the water cooler 
tthree times a morning and all the men covertly watch her. 
tShe is cute, but attractive more by comparison to the other 
twomen in the office. Nevertheless, all the men, including 
tEddie and Charlie, let their eyes cautiously watch her as 
tshe leaves, her sheath dress tight on her hips.
<b> 
</b>tEddie, who has hung up, now rubs his eyes with two fingers to 
tclear his head and picks up the phone again.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttMary, give me the Hotel Westmore. 
ttCircle 7-0598.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(hands Kennie paper) 
ttThis isn't for me -- it's for you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(to the others) 
ttNow who owes me on the presents? 
ttCharlie, you owe me?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI gave you four bucks yesterday....
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttI owe you, Eddie. I'll pay you 
tttomorrow, payday.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttMiss Frances Kelley, please. I 
ttthink it's room 417.... 

tThe three heads around him look slowly up from their 
trespective work, naked interest manifest on their faces.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(calling to one 
tttof the women in 
tttthe office) 
ttHey, Evelyn, you owe me four bucks. 

<b>ttttEVELYN
</b>ttt(calling back) 
ttAll right. I know.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttHello, Frances, this is Eddie.... 
ttAll right, wait a minute. Give me a 
ttchance to explain.... I know I woke 
ttyou up.... All right, let me tell 
ttyou. You know I'm supposed to be the 
ttbest man at this fellow Arnold's 
ttwedding. So I called him up last 
ttnight because I didn't know whether 
ttI was supposed to wear tuxedo or 
tttails. Well, he didn't know either, 
ttso he said: "Come on over to my 
ttgirl's house with me tonight. 
ttThey're making all the arrangements 
ttfor the wedding now." So I called 
ttyou and left a message at the desk 
ttsaying I couldn't get over till 
ttabout ten o'clock.... All right! 
ttThat's what I'm going to explain! 
tt... Thank you.
ttt(holds receiver 
tttagainst his chest 
tttand looks at his 
tttcolleagues with 
tttair of a man being 
ttttried just a little 
ttttoo much. Returns 
tttreceiver to his ear, 
tttlistens for a moment) 
ttAll right, so I had to go over to 
ttArnold's girl's house with Arnold 
ttlast night. Well, there was about 
ttthirty people there, and, man, you 
ttnever saw such a crazy mess. There 
ttwas this little bald-headed guy 
ttthere. He's the bride's uncle. He's 
ttcome all the way down from Boston 
ttwith his whole family to go to the 
ttwedding. The only trouble was, he 
ttwasn't invited. Well, this crazy 
ttuncle, he grabs ahold of me, he 
ttstarts shaking me by the lapels. So 
ttI said: "What do you want from me? 
ttI ain't the groom! I'm just trying 
ttto find out whether I'm supposed to 
ttwear tuxedo or tails." 
ttt(apparently this got 
ttta laugh. Eddie breaks 
tttinto a smile) 
ttFunny, huh? ... Look, Frances. I 
tthave to go to work now. I'm calling 
ttyou from the office. How about 
ttletting me make this up to you? I'll 
tttake you out to dinner Saturday 
ttnight.... I can't make it tonight. 
ttThe bachelor party's tonight.... 
ttAll right, Saturday night.... It's a 
ttdate.... S'help me.... I swear, right 
tton time. Eight-thirty, okay? ... 
ttOkay, we'll have a ball. Goodbye, go 
ttback to sleep.
<b> 
</b>tHe hangs up. The three married men look down again to their 
tledgers and tap away again on their adding machines. Eddie 
tsits slumped in his seat for a moment.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWhat did I just tell that girl, 
ttSaturday night?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(picks up phone)
ttMary, give me Columbus 5-1098.... 
ttWhat do you mean personal calls! 
ttThese are business calls! Well, stop 
ttlistening to other people's 
ttconversations.... What have you got, 
ttstock in the company? Columbus 
<b>tt5-1098. 
</b>ttt(waits)
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttListen, Eddie, I don't think I can 
ttgo tonight. My father-in-law's in 
ttfrom Akron, Ohio, and----
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(all sweetness) 
ttHello, who is this, Mrs. Stebbins? 
tt... This is Eddie, Mrs. Stebbins. I 
ttwonder if I can talk to Muriel.... 
ttCould I speak to her? ... Thank 
ttyou.... 

tThe three married men each look up slowly again, naked envy 
ton each face.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttMuriel, baby, listen, sweetie, I 
ttcan't make it Saturday night.... I'm 
ttall loused up with this wedding I'm 
ttsupposed to be the best man at.... 
ttWe have to rehearse the ceremony. 
ttYou'd think they were getting 
ttmarried on television.... Yes, 
ttsweetie, why don't I call you Monday. 
ttMaybe, we'll work out something 
ttbefore you go back to California.... 
ttAll right, sweetie, good-bye.

tHe hangs up, sits a moment, then finally removes the 
tcigarette from his mouth, crushes it in his ash tray, and 
tturns to the others.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWell, what do you say? I'm going to 
ttcall Louie and make a reservation 
ttfor a table for tonight. Who's 
ttcoming and who isn't? Walter, you're 
ttcoming, right? It won't cost you 
ttmore than three-fifty for the whole 
ttmeal. What do you say, Walter? You 
ttonly live once.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(strangely sad) 
ttThat's right. You only live once.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWell, yes or no?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAll right, I'll come.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttKennie?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah, I'll get out of the house for 
tta change.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHow about you, Charlie?
<b> 
</b>tCharlie is frowning down at a sheaf of adding machine totals 
tin front of him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI don't think so, Eddie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttAh, come on, Charlie, you got to 
ttbust loose every now and then. We'll 
tthave a couple of drinks.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(picks up phone) 
ttMary, give me an outside line and 
ttdon't give me no trouble.... 
ttChickering 4-5099. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttCome on, Charlie, it's a short life, 
ttbelieve me. 

tMove in for CLOSEUP of Charlie, frowning. Over this, Eddie's 
tvoice.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE'S VOICE
</b>ttHello, hello, Louie? Is this Louie? 
tt... Louie, this is Eddie Watkins. 
ttI'd like to reserve a table for 
ttfour for tonight.... For four ...

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHey, Eddie ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE'S VOICE
</b>ttWhat?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCount me in.
<b> 
</b>tHe immediately bends back to his work, takes his pencil up 
tagain. CAMERA PULLS QUICKLY UP AND AWAY until we have an 
tANGLE SHOT looking down at their desks in various positions 
tof work.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttLouie, make that five.... Five guys 
tt... Yeah, a bachelor party ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b> 
</b><b>tFADE IN 
</b>
<b>tEXTERIOR. DOWNTOWN NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>tFADE IN with a big loud blare on Eighth Street in Greenwich 
tVillage on a warm August night. Packed sidewalks, jammed 
ttraffic, taxis, trucks, buses, honking of horns, etc. 
tMan-we're-going-to-have-a-ball type feeling.

<b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tEXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT
</b>tThirteenth Street off Sixth Avenue not so blary and lit up 
tas the main drags, but traffic is heavy, and there are lots 
tof people on the sidewalks. There are a number of restaurants 
tdotting the street with their little striped awnings and 
tmodest neons. If we are on our toes, we notice one neon that 
treads: "LOUIE'S."
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. LOUIE'S RESTAURANT
</b>tThe entire interior isn't too much to show, really. It's a 
tsmall restaurant, but it is packed. Waiters scurry here and 
tthere. People jammer and jab. Hustle and bustle. In 
tbackground, we can pick out our bachelor party, five men now, 
tclustered around a table, yakking it up.
<b> 
</b>tWIDE SHOT of our bachelor party, showing all five. They all 
tseem to be in the best of spirits. The new member of the cast 
tis Arnold, the groom, a towheaded, pleasant-looking young man 
tof thirty, shy to the point of being noticeable. Of all the 
tmen at the party, he is the quietest. He sits, a smile nailed 
tonto his face, turning his head from one friend to another as 
tthey talk, enjoying the rare privilege of being liked. The 
tdinner is over. During the ensuing scene, a bus boy continues 
tto remove the used dishes. Several large bottles of beer and 
ttwo fifths of Scotch are on the table. There is a welter of 
tvariously assorted glasses. Eddie, Walter, and Kenneth are 
tsmoking cigars, Charlie a cigarette. The Groom is not 
tsmoking.  We have cut into the scene during a jumble of 
tconversation. Walter is talking to Charlie, whose head is 
tbent toward the older man. Kenneth is trying to tell the 
tGroom a joke, but the Groom's attention is being distracted
tby Eddie, who is leaning across the table trying to get 
tCharlie's attention. Ad libs.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(finishing story) 
ttThree hundred pounds! Isn't she kind 
ttof fat? No, man, tall! Hey, waiter! 
ttWaiter!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHey, Charlie ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(to Charlie) 
tt... so we were stationed right 
ttoutside Paris, about eight miles, a 
tttown called Chatou ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>tt... hey, Charlie ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(to Charlie) 
tt... so the first night, a whole 
ttbunch of us swiped a jeep out of the 
ttmotor court. We had a feller there 
ttwho was a tech sergeant in the motor 
ttcourt. Oh, what a character he was! 
ttHe used to get loaded every night on 
ttthat vanilla extract.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHey, Charlie ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat do you want, Eddie?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHey, Charlie, did I ever tell you 
ttabout the time I was stationed at 
ttBuckley Field in Denver, and I 
ttpicked up this girl in Lakeside 
ttAmusement Park?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHey, Eddie, listen to this story 
ttI'm telling Charlie. Hey, Arnold, 
ttI'm telling Charlie about the time 
ttme and that crazy tech sergeant 
ttfrom the motor court got loaded on 
ttvanilla extract and went to Paris 
tt... Hey, Kenneth ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttWhen do the Giants come back from 
tttheir road trip, does anybody know?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHey, let's give out the presents now.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHey, Kenneth, listen to this story. 
ttI was stationed outside of Paris, 
ttabout eight miles ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttOh, that Paris! I was there for two 
ttdays! Clubs! You had to beat the 
ttwomen off with clubs! ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(to people at 
tttanother table) 
ttWhat ...? Oh, it's a bachelor party 
tt-- this guy's getting married.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttListen, I want to give the 
ttpresents ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWell, let me tell you what 
tthappened ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHey, you know what was a great town 
ttfor women, Hamburg!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttHamburg! Clubs! Clubs! You had to 
ttbeat them off with clubs! Hey, 
ttwaiter -- who's our waiter?  
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHey, Arnold, enjoying yourself?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttThe first night I was in Hamburg, 
tttwo Frauleins come walking right in 
ttthe barracks. So I said to the 
ttlieutenant ...
<b> 
</b>tWalter, who is pretty lit, suddenly stands and bangs the 
ttable mightily with his fist.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(bellowing out) 
ttThe best fighting outfit in the 
ttwhole fighting army was the fighting 
ttHundred and Fourth Infantry Division, 
ttGeneral Terry Allen commanding!
<b> 
</b>tThis brings the jumbled conversation to a halt. Walter 
tsurveys the other four, looking for possible challenges, 
tthen sits heavily down.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(standing) 
ttWell, now that we got that settled....
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm with you, Walter.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttWe believe you, Walter.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttI'd like to make a little speech to 
ttour guest of honor and mutual friend, 
ttArnold Craig. Arnold, a bunch of us 
ttdown the office, the girls too, all 
ttchipped in, and we got you a couple 
ttof small gifts....
<b> 
</b>tEddie crosses to extra chair, picks up wrapped gifts, crosses 
tback to his place.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(whispering to Kenneth) 
ttThese are the gag gifts. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttLet's see, what's this one? Oh, yeah. 
ttArnold, we figured Louise might be 
ttvery sleepy on your wedding night, 
ttso we thought you might want 
ttsomething to keep you warm.
<b> 
</b>tWalter leans forward to see what the tissue-wrapped parcel 
tArnold is now unwrapping is.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat is it? What is it?
<b> 
</b>tArnold holds a hot-water bottle aloft. Walter is seized with 
ta paroxysm of laughter at this immensely Rabelaisian gift.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttIt's a hot-water bottle!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttOkay, Walter, okay.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHey, did you see that? Hey, he bought 
tthim a hot-water bottle for his 
ttwedding night. Hey, that's funny ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHey, Eddie, you should have bought 
tthim an ice pack for after tonight.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(holding a 
tttsecond parcel)
ttWalter, take it easy.... Now, this 
ttone, Arnold, this one is something 
ttto keep you busy on cold winter 
ttnights.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(crosses to Arnold; 
tttto the others) 
ttThis ought to be good.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttLook at Walter.
<b> 
</b>tWalter has come around behind Arnold's chair and can hardly 
twait to see what the next joke is.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHey, these are funny. Who bought 
ttthese? You buy these, Eddie? These 
ttare funny. You got a good sense of 
tthumor.
<b> 
</b>tArnold unwraps the parcel, holds out a miniature baby bottle. 
tThis is too much for Walter; how funny can you get? He 
tclutches his sides.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHey, did you guys see that? Hey, did 
ttyou guys see that?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCome on, Walter, sit down.
<b> 
</b>tCharlie and Kenneth are smiling appreciatively. Walter 
tcrosses with bottle, sits, starts pouring whisky into baby 
tbottle.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttEddie got a good sense of humor, you 
ttknow?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(to Charlie) 
ttBoy, old Walter is crocked.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttt(smiling, rising 
ttthalfway in his chair) 
ttListen, I want to thank you. Really. 
ttI really want to thank you fellows.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWe haven't got to the serious 
ttpresents yet, Arnold. 

tA hush falls over the assembled guests. Arnold composes his 
tface into a solemn expression and looks down at the 
tcluttered table.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(solemnly) 
ttWell, in all seriousness, Arnold, 
ttseriously, I don't know why you 
ttpicked me to be your best man, but I 
ttam deeply honored. I guess it's 
ttbecause we're both Dodger fans, and 
ttI'm going to miss you at next 
ttTuesday's night game when the 
ttPittsburgh Pirates invade Ebbets 
ttField. We always had a lot of fun 
tttogether, and, seriously, Arnold, 
ttin all seriousness, good luck on 
ttyour wedding, but see if you can't 
ttget out of the house occasionally, 
ttsee a night game or even a Sunday 
ttdoubleheader with your old buddy, 
ttEddie.
<b> 
</b>tThis touching address has brought a note of sadness to the 
tgathering. Indeed, there are tears in Walter's and Arnold's 
teyes.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(handing Arnold 
ttttwo neatly wrapped 
tttpackages) 
ttWell, anyway, in all seriousness, 
tthere are a couple of presents from 
ttall of us in the office and good 
ttluck. 

tArnold takes the presents, stands, head bowed. Eddie sits 
tand all faces turn to Arnold.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttWell, I just want to thank you 
ttfellows. I don't know what to say. 
ttI just want to thank you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttOpen the presents, Arnold.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI will. I just want to say, Eddie, 
ttthat when the Pirates invade Ebbets 
ttField next Tuesday night, I'm going 
ttto be sitting right there in Section 
tt37 there right with you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttYou'll be on your honeymoon next 
ttTuesday, Arnold. 

tThis interesting information gives Arnold pause.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttGee, that's right. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(smiling) 
ttArnold, you're getting married 
ttSunday, did you forget?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttLook at him blush.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttt(frowning fuzzily) 
ttNo, I didn't forget. It's just that 
tt... Gee, that's right. Sunday. 
ttWhat's today, Thursday? 

ttttKENNETH and EDDIE 
ttAll day!
<b>

<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tEXTERIOR. EIGHTH STREET -- NIGHT
</b>tWe look down on Eighth Street in Greenwich Village. It is 
teight thirty at night. It is a fairly active and well-lit 
tstreet, bright with neons and movie marquees and lit-up 
tshops. Our five carousers are marching down the sidewalk, 
tthat is four of them are on the sidewalk. Walter can't quite 
tdecide whether he wants to walk on the sidewalk or in the 
tstreet. He keeps hopping in and out between the parked cars, 
trunning to catch up when he falls behind. They are all 
tfeeling pretty good. Arnold is singing in a wavering 
tbaritone:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttDe-Witt C-l-i-n-t-o-n
ttBoom! 
ttClinton!
ttOh, Cli-inton!

<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tEXTERIOR. GREENWICH AVENUE AND TENTH STREET -- NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>tGROUP SHOT of our five carousers paused on the curb, waiting 
tfor the lights to change in their favor. Greenwich Avenue 
ttraffic is pretty heavy, going in both directions. The five 
tmen are kind of strung out along the curb with Charlie being 
tthe last in line. Standing beside him, also waiting for the 
tlight to change, is a good-looking, well-dressed, chic young 
twoman of twenty-four or five.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttWhere we going? Eddie's place to 
ttsee movies?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD

</b>ttt(indicating the

ttWho's your beautiful friend, Charlie?

</b>tCharlie turns and regards the pretty young woman.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(to the girl) 
ttExcuse me. My friend down there 
ttwants to know who you are.
<b> 
</b>tThe young woman, who for our own mysterious purposes we shall 
trefer to as The Existentialist, regards the five reasonably 
ttight young men all staring at her. Kenneth has already begun 
tto giggle.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttt(with a Mona Lisa smile) 
ttWhere are you all from, out-of-town?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIndiana.
ttt(turning to 
tttthe others) 
ttIsn't that right, fellers? We're 
ttfrom Indiana, right?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttIndiana! Indiana, man!

tKenneth and Arnold, to whom this incident is already 
tunbearably funny, have turned away and are clutching their 
tsides, trying to suppress a fit of giggles.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(to The Existentialist) 
ttWe're from the Hoosier State, ma'am...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttTerre Haute! We're from Terre Haute!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(to The Existentialist) 
ttWe're from Terre Haute, and we've 
ttcome to the big city looking for a 
ttgood time, and we just don't know 
ttwhat to do with ourselves, ma'am.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(to Walter) 
ttLook at that Charlie operate.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttMust be a convention in town.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWe've just come off the ranch there, 
tthoney, and we're just raring. Is 
ttthat right, men? Are we raring?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWe're raring, boy, we're raring!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(beside himself 
tttwith laughter) 
ttHey, Charlie, cut it out, will you?
<b> 
</b>tThe lights change and The Existentialist starts off across 
tGreenwich Avenue to the west side of the street. The five 
tcarousers follow right along after her.  That is, Charlie 
tdogs along behind The Existentialist as they cross the 
tstreet. Walter and Eddie are close behind him, listening to 
tCharlie's pitch. Kenneth and Arnold, embarrassed and 
tgiggling, stagger along behind. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(chugging along behind 
tttThe Existentialist) 
ttWe're down here in Greenwich Village 
ttlooking for some wild bohemians. Do 
ttyou happen to know any wild 
ttbohemians?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttAll right, fellows, enough's enough, 
tthuh?
<b> 
</b>tShe steps up to the sidewalk on the west side of Greenwich 
tAvenue and hurries along down Tenth Street to a little house 
tabout four doors down, the five carousers on her heels like 
ta pack of puppies.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(hurrying along after 
tttThe Existentialist) 
ttI'm something of a poet myself, 
ttma'am. Many's the long night in the
ttbunkhouse where I sat by myself and 
ttwrote by the flickering light of a 
ttkerosene lamp. Could I read you some 
ttof my poems, ma'am? I know they 
ttain't much, but they're from the 
ttheart, ma'am. 

tThe Existentialist pauses in her hurried walk down Tenth 
tStreet to examine Charlie with some interest.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttYou have a sense of humor, don't you?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(to Charlie) 
ttYou're going great, man, don't stop 
ttnow. 

tThe Existentialist goes up the two little steps to the front 
tdoor of the house and rings the bell.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(to The Existentialist) 
ttWhere are you going, honey? 

tThe Existentialist waits composed and patient for someone to 
tanswer her ring. Charlie has wandered back to Arnold and 
tKenneth, and the three of them are now suffused with 
tlaughter. Kenneth has been laughing so much, tears are 
tcoming out of his eyes. He walks around in little circles 
tclutching his sides. Several passersby hurry by, noting the 
tstrange little group on the sidewalk.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(to The Existentialist) 
ttWhat's going on in there, honey?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>tt t(patiently bored)
 ttThere's a party going on. I'm not sure 
ttI'm invited myself, so I can't really 
ttinvite you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttSure you can.
<b> 
</b>tThe door opens and a woman in a tea gown stands there 
tlooking at The Existentialist and then at the five men on 
tthe sidewalk. Behind her, there is evidence of a party going 
ton.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE HOSTESS
</b>ttHow nice to see you, darling. Who 
ttare your friends?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttI haven't the vaguest idea. I was 
ttambushed crossing Greenwich Avenue 
ttby a tribe of the Terre Haute 
ttKiwanis.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE HOSTESS
</b>ttt(she waves a vague 
ttthand in a sort of 
tttshooing motion at 
tttthe five men on 
tttthe sidewalk) 
ttGo away, you men. Go back to the 
ttBiltmore Hotel and put on your red 
ttcaps.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttI always thought you city people 
ttwere more hospitable to us poor 
ttfarm boys.
<b> 
</b>tThe other four carousers are laughing too much to even talk. 
tCharlie has ambled up to The Existentialist, who is peering 
tover her hostess into the room behind her. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(to The Existentialist,
tttsmiling amiably) 
ttI'm sorry, miss. A friend of ours is 
ttgetting married here, and we're just 
tthorsing around.
<b> 
</b>tThe Existentialist looks into the young man's smiling, 
trather winning face.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttWhy don't you come back after you 
ttget rid of your friends.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHe'll be back!
<b> 
</b>tShe turns abruptly and disappears past the hostess into the 
troom.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(to Charlie) 
ttMan, she likes you, man!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE HOSTESS
</b>ttNow, you boys go away.
<b> 
</b>tShe backs into her house and closes the door. Eddie starts 
tup the steps to the door. The other four just roar with 
tlaughter, clutch their sides, and giggle and snort.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWell, what do you say, men, are we 
ttgoing to this party, or aren't we?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(laughing) 
ttCome on, Eddie. I thought you had 
ttsome movies you want to show us.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWhat do you want to see movies for? 
ttYou got the real thing right here.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(laughing) 
ttEddie, we're married men here.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttCome on, let's crash this party. 
ttI've been to these Greenwich Village 
ttparties. Man, they're wild.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttCome on, Eddie, let's go up to your 
ttplace, see these movies.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(coming reluctantly 
tttback to the others,

ttMan, you were going strong with that 
ttgirl. You could have scored. She's 
ttjust waiting for you. Go in after 
tther.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttCome on, Eddie. Let's go see the 
ttmovies.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(to the others) 
ttAll right, I live about three blocks

ttall right, let's go see movies.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. THE BACHELOR'S APARTMENT
</b>tEddie is scowling over a home-style movie projector, 
tmuttering over the intricacies of fitting a reel into the 
tratchets. Arnold has suddenly become voluble and is gabbing 
taway at him. CAMERA DOLLIES AROUND THEM during the scene so 
tthat we can see into the living room of the apartment, 
tappointed in simple but neat masculine taste, where the 
tother three men move in and out of view. Right now, we are 
tconcerned only with Arnold and Eddie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>tt... we're moving in with her mother 
ttand father. I don't know if that's 
ttsuch a good idea. What do you think? 
ttWe haven't got an apartment yet, and 
ttwe figure we'll live a year with her 
ttfolks, save on the rent, see? 

tKenneth comes back from the kitchen with three open bottles 
tof beer.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttAnybody want a bottle of beer?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttt(to Eddie) 
ttShe's a widow, and that bothers me a 
ttlittle. I don't know why. She's two 
ttyears older than me. I don't know if 
ttyou know that. Her husband got killed 
ttin Korea. She's a cousin of mine, you 
ttknow.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(moving into 
tttthe living room) 
ttWho wants a bottle of beer?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll take a bottle.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah, give me one.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttA third cousin, something like that. 
ttIt's not good for cousins to marry, 
ttis it? What do you think of her? I 
ttknow she's not terribly pretty, but 
ttI mean ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(muttering imprecations 
tttat the projector) 
ttArnold, leave me alone a minute, 
ttwill you?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttSure.
ttt(turns to the others in 
tttliving room, plants a 
ttthuge smile on his face) 
ttWell, I'm getting married Sunday. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttHaving fun, Walter?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFun. A bunch of grown men sitting 
ttaround waiting to look at college 
ttboy pictures.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI swear, I never thought two months 
ttago I was ever going to get married. 
ttI still don't know how it happened....
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHey, somebody turn off the lights. 

tWalter is promptly up to turn off the lights.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHey, you know, you've got a nice 
ttplace here. 

tThe room is abruptly flooded in darkness. A beam of light 
tshoots out from the projector. It seems pointed at the 
twindow. Arnold stands up directly in the shaft of light.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI was just taking her out. I didn't 
ttknow it was so serious.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttArnold, get out of the way, will 
ttyou?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttOh, sure.
<b> 
</b>tArnold moves a step, still in the shaft of light, his shadow 
thuge on the wall. Eddie, muttering, jockeys the projector 
taround trying to focus it on the screen. The square of light 
tand some flickering images wander up and down a wall.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>tt... We're sitting in the car, so she 
ttsays: "Well, Arnold, we've been 
ttgoing together six months now. I 
ttthink it's time we decided whether 
ttwe were being serious." 

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHey, Eddie, you got it on the window.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI didn't know it was so serious. I 
ttdidn't even know we were going 
tttogether. I just took her out every 
ttnow and then.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttArnold, you're funny.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttTurn on the lights again, will you, 
ttWalter.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat's the matter?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttI forgot to loop it over this loop 
ttthing.
<b> 
</b>tWalter crosses to light switch. The room is flooded in light 
tagain.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOh, for crying out loud.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttt(small panic) 
ttI can't even remember what she looks 
ttlike! I just saw her this afternoon!

</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttArnold, have a bottle of beer. It's 
ttnot so terrible.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttBoy, I tell you. It's for the rest 
ttof your life when you get married. 
ttThis is a big decision to make.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDoes anybody seriously want to see 
ttthese movies? 

tEddie is furiously winding and unwinding spools. CAMERA HAS 
tDOLLIED AROUND so that we are looking back up the living 
troom toward the projector and the men.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI could be making a serious mistake.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttArnold, you're in the way again. 
ttCome on now. All right, put off the 
ttlights.
<b> 
</b>tThe room is flooded in darkness again. Walter hurries to a 
tchair. The square of light is reasonably focused, just an 
tedge trailing off onto the drapes of the window. Numbers 
tflicker quickly on on the screen. The rest of the scene we 
tsee looking into the whitened faces of the five men at their 
tvarious posts. Arnold crosses, stands back of Walter.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttHere we go.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHey, Arnold, if this is the one I 
ttthink it is, there's one part here I

</b>ttt(a picture of determined 
tttboredom, but putting on 
ttthis glasses) 
ttThis is for kids.

</b>ttSays he -- putting on his glasses.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>tt"The Baseball Game." That's a nice 
tttitle, don't you think?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttThis is the one, Arnold. There's a 
ttguy in here who looks just like 
ttArnold.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttHey, she's not bad. Usually, the 
ttgirls in these things look like 
ttdinosaurs.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(his eyes glued 
tttto the screen) 
ttA bunch of grown men ...
<b> 
</b>tHe breaks off as apparently some interesting action has 
tstarted on screen. An involuntary grunt of acknowledgment 
tescapes him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttI got these pictures off my dentist. 
ttI don't know where be got them. 
ttThere you are, Arnold, that's you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE  
</b>ttYeah, it does look like Arnold.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttDoesn't that look like Arnold?
<b>

</b>ttWho's looking at the guy?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttArnold, you've got a great career 
ttahead of you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttThat girl looks like the girl 
ttCharlie picked up just before.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttProbably is.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThat fellow there is not a bad actor.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttActor. You could play that part 
ttpretty easy yourself.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttI think the Daily News gave this one 
ttfour stars.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttI'd like to see this in Three-D.
<b> 
</b>tThe side comments drift off for a moment, and a sort of 
tfrozen attention settles on the white faces. Each face is 
tsort of set in a mold of determined disinterest, but the 
teyes are all watching.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWell, I'll just watch one of them. 
ttThen, I think I'll just go home.

</b>tHe wets his lips, lifts the bottle of beer to his mouth and 
ttakes a swallow. His eyes never leave the screen.

</b>tHelen standing in front of the laundry part of the sink, 
tdoing her private laundry. She has on a house smock and her 
tsleeves are rolled up. The doorbell rings. Helen takes a 
ttowel off the doorknob behind her and, wiping her hands, 
tcomes down across the dining area to the front door. She 
topens the door to admit a young woman, about eight years 
tolder than Helen.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttHiya, Julie. I was beginning to 
ttthink you weren't coming.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE

ttI was at my mother's house. Did they

ttto call you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttYeah, your mother was very sweet.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttYou should have seen my father. I 
ttsaid, "Pa, you have another 
ttgrandchild coming." So he said, 
tt"Who?" So I said, "Charlie." So he 
ttsaid, "That little Helen?" So I said, 
tt"If it isn't that little Helen, 
ttCharlie better leave town." So out 
ttcame the beer. Well, they've been 
ttafter Charlie to have a baby for a 
ttlong time now. I said, "Pa, leave 
tthim alone. Let him get established 
ttbefore he saddles himself with a

ttIs that what you're doing? 
ttt(she sits) 
ttWhen I had my first baby, Mike was 
ttashamed to be seen on the streets 
ttwith me. Well, listen, he was 
ttinterning at the time. We needed a 
ttbaby like a hole in the head. That's 
ttwhy he's a general practitioner now, 
ttbecause of that baby. He was 
ttstudying to be a surgeon. He 
ttabsolutely refused to admit I was 
ttpregnant. Even in my ninth month, 
ttand I was as big as a house. He 
ttused to walk ten paces in front of 
ttme in the street like he didn't 
ttknow who that woman with the belly 
ttwas. Where is Charlie anyway?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI told you he--

ttWhat are they going to do, get a 
ttlittle drunk?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttAre you kidding? What do you think 
ttthese bachelor parties are for, 
ttbachelors? This is for the married 
ttmen. It's a good excuse to get 
ttdrunk and find some girls. 

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttCan you picture Charlie getting 
ttdrunk and picking up a girl? 
ttCharlie's old sobersides. You 
ttshould have seen what I went through 
ttto get him to make a pass at me. 
ttHe's so sweet. Nobody knows how 
ttreally sweet he is, he's so quiet 
ttall the time. My brother died in 
ttSeptember, he used to stay up with 
ttme till three, four o'clock every 
ttnight. I used to cry all night, and 
tthe used to sit on the bed and talk 
ttwith me. I used to look at him 
tttalking there, and I used to think: 
tt"What would I do without this sweet

</b>ttWait'll you've been married eleven

</b>ttWait'll you've been married eleven

tShe looks down at her hands in her lap.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttListen, I will take a cup of tea if 
ttyou've got one. 

tShe stands, opens the pantry, looks around among the cans 
tand packages for a box of tea bags.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(quite shocked) 
ttYou're kidding, aren't you?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttt(finds the box 
tttof tea bags) 
ttWould I kid about something like 
ttthat?
<b> 
</b>tShe puts the box of tea bags an the workshelf, unhooks a 
tsaucepan hanging over the stove, turns to the sink and fills 
tit with water. Helen regards her, not quite knowing what to 
tsay. Julie sets the saucepan going on the stove, stares at 
tit.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttI don't know why I told you. Don't 
tttell anybody, not even Charlie. I 
ttdon't want the family to know. But 
ttthis woman isn't the first one. I 
ttknow that much. About three years 
ttago, the doorbell rings. I open the 
ttdoor. There's a man there. He says: 
tt"Tell your husband to stay away from 
ttmy sister." How would you like to 
ttopen the door and have somebody say 
ttthat to you? I cried for two weeks. 
ttI don't know what to do about it, 
ttHelen. Should I bring it out in the 
ttopen with Mike or should I just keep 
ttmy mouth shut like the other time? 
ttBecause he's not going to leave me. 
ttEven if he doesn't care about me, 
tthe has his kids to think about. We 
ttmarried too young. That was our big 
ttmistake. We married too young. 

tHer face, her whole body suddenly tightens to forestall any 
tpossibility of breaking into tears, and she sits down 
tabruptly on the kitchen stool, her eyes clenched tight and 
ther face rigidly impassive. Helen remains nervously silent.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttt(her voice rising just 
ttta little from the 
tttsuppressed emotion 
tttwithin her) 
ttWe should have waited till he 
ttfinished his internship. What kind 
ttof married life is that? Twenty-two 
ttdollars a month he was earning. 
ttEvery other day, he had to sleep in 
ttthe hospital. The first two years of 
ttour marriage, we didn't even see 
tteach other. And then I'm pregnant. 
ttHe had to quit, what do you think? 
ttHe wanted to be a surgeon, he wound 
ttup being a G.P. From that day he 
tthated me. I had two other children 
ttby him, but he hated me. He told me 
ttin just so many words. Why do you 
ttthink I kept telling you, Helen, why 
ttdo you think I kept telling you: 
tt"Don't have a baby till Charlie finds 
tthimself." 
ttt(suddenly cries out) 
ttIt hurts! Even after eleven years, 
ttit hurts!
<b> 
</b>tShe stands abruptly and moves quickly past Helen out the 
tkitchen doorway into the dark living room, leaving Helen 
tstanding troubled, concerned, in the kitchen. After a moment, 
tHelen moves to the kitchen doorway and a step out into the 
tdining area. She looks through the dark living room to the 
tgray silhouette of Julie standing by the living room window, 
ther form lightly outlined by a tracing of moonlight.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttAre you all right, Julie?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttt(muttering) 
ttI'm all right. I'm all right.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. BACHELOR'S APARTMENT (45 MINUTES LATER)
</b>tWe are looking back up the living room as we were at the 
tclose of the last scene in this apartment. The room is 
tabsolutely dark now, but a light pours in from the foyer. In 
tthis shaft of light, we can see Eddie moving from behind the 
tprojector to the wall switch and turning on the lights. The 
troom is abruptly bright with light, and our five men squint 
tagainst the sudden glare. They have all changed their 
tpositions and taken off their jackets and loosened their 
tties. They are lolling about. CAMERA LOOKS DOWN TO THE FLOOR 
tto take particular note of eight empty beer bottles, an 
topened fifth of bourbon, ash trays, crumpled packs of 
tcigarettes, a cup and saucer, somebody's shoes, somebody's 
tjacket that has fallen off the back of a chair. Over this 
twe hear Walter's voice:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttIs that the last one?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttYeah.
<b> 
</b>tA thick silence fills the room. There is a kind of sodden 
tfeeling to this scene. After a long moment, Walter's voice 
tagain:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAh, you've seen one, you've seen 
ttthem all. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah, they're all alike.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI don't know -- I think the first 
ttone was all right.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah, I was so bored by the rest of 
ttthem. I nearly fell asleep during 
ttthe last one.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYou in the habit of sleeping with 
ttyour eyes open? 

tWe look down on the room now, at all five of the men, Eddie 
trewinding the last reel, the little motor of the projector 
thumming. The others loll about, their legs dangling over the 
tarmrests of the soft chairs and sofas. There is a heavy, 
tdense mood that no one seems willing to break.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat time's it about, anybody know?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttt(glancing at his watch) 
ttI got a quarter to nine.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttNo, it's later than that, about a 
ttquarter after. 

tAgain the silence falls upon the five men. Only the humming 
tlittle motor interrupts the thick silence. Nobody moves.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(after a moment) 
ttAh, you see one, you've seen them 
ttall.
<b> 
</b>tAgain the silence. Charlie stretches over for his bottle of 
tbeer on the floor beside his chair. He pours what's left of 
tthe bottle into the glass standing beside it. Otherwise 
tnobody moves.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(after a moment) 
ttSo that's the last one you've got to 
ttshow us, Eddie?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttYeah. You want to run them backwards?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttI wonder where they get the girls to 
ttmake these movies?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttMight as well go home, I guess.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYeah.
<b> 
</b>tThe idea doesn't seem to propel anybody to any decisive 
tmovement. Walter shifts his position on the sofa, stretches 
tout his legs, regards his shoes with a sudden sadness.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(after a moment) 
ttLife is short.
<b> 
</b>tThis gives everybody something to think about for a moment.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(hunched over 
tttthe projector, 
tttdismantling it) 
ttYou guys feel like going down to 
tthave a drink for Arnold?
<b> 
</b>tThis brings a reaction. Walter stands.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah! What do you say? One last 
ttdrink for Arnold!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOkay with me.
<b> 
</b>tSuddenly life is back in the room, the men ad-lib: "Where's 
tmy coat?" "Let's get out of here," etc. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(unwinding himself 
tttfrom his slouched 
tttposition on a chair) 
ttYou can say what you want to about 
ttthese pictures -- they're really 
ttpretty bad -- but they get you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttDon't you think we ought to clean up 
ttthe place?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttNo, I got a woman comes in.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(grabbing up 
ttthis jacket) 
ttI almost fell asleep during the 
ttlast one. 
ttt(he looks at 
tttthe others) 
ttWell, what do you say, huh? Let's 
ttgo! One last drink! 

tAd libs on exit.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. LIVING ROOM CHARLIE AND HELEN'S APARTMENT
</b>tHelen and Julie. A corner lamp in the living room is lit, 
tlending a soft but not too effective light to the room. The 
ttwo young women are on the couch. Helen sits curled at one 
tend, head down listening to Julie, who has been talking and 
tprobably crying a little since we last saw them forty-five 
tminutes ago. Julie is seated with her legs stretched out in 
tfront of her, her head resting back on the back of the couch. 
tShe is talking more freely and easily now, the first hard 
toutburst over with.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>tt... He's a boy, my Mike. Till the 
ttday he dies, he'll never be more 
ttthan fifteen. Perpetual adolescence, 
ttthat's the curse of the professional 
ttman. He spends his whole youth trying 
ttto be a doctor, a lawyer, an 
ttaccountant. Then he spends the rest 
ttof his life looking for the fun he 
ttshould have had when he was a boy.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttOh, I know. Charlie and I hardly 
tteven see each other.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttIt's very hard on the wife, Helen. 
ttThese are the years when you should 
ttbe building your marriage. Instead, 
ttyou grow away from each other. I've 
ttseen it happen with my friends. In 
ttthe end, they have nice homes in New 
ttRochelle, and a maid, and their 
ttmaids are happier than they are. But 
ttsometimes it does work. It can be 
ttdone, Helen. Encourage Charlie to 
ttstay with his school because...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttOh, I will, Julie ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>tt... he's an ambitious boy ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>tt... oh, it's not just he's 
ttambitious ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>tt... and if he doesn't fulfill 
tthimself, he'll resent you and your 
ttbaby the rest of his life.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttOh, I don't want him to quit. He 
ttloves accounting, Julie. I see him 
ttsometimes, sitting over his homework. 
ttHe's got his ledgers out, and he's 
ttadding up columns of figures as long 
ttas his arm. And he's chuckling. 
ttYou'd think he was reading the 
ttcomics. He has a book there, 
ttBusiness Law. How he can read it I 
ttdon't know. But I'll be watching 
tttelevision or something, and he'll 
ttcome over, and he'll start telling 
ttme about some fine legal point. I 
ttdon't know what he's talking about, 
ttbut it's enough for me to see how 
ttexcited it makes him. He loves it,
ttJulie. You can't take something like 
ttthat away from him. It's just -- 
ttit's just I feel we're not really 
ttclose any more. I mean, he comes 
tthome from school, lots of times I'm 
ttasleep already. And, when I do see 
tthim, he seems all involved with 
tthimself. He looks at me sometimes as 
ttif I were a stranger to him, and I 
ttfeel sometimes I am. I'm afraid of 
ttthat, Julie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttThen get rid of the baby.
<b> 
</b>tIt is said simply, inevitably, even innocently. It brings 
tonly a frown to Helen's face and a short silence.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttIf I had it to do again, believe me, 
ttthat's what I would do.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(slowly becoming aware 
tttof the depth of what 
tttthey are talking about) 
ttYou don't mean that, Julie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttYes, I do. My children are the only 
ttthings in my life now, but I would 
ttrather have a husband.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI wouldn't even think about it.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttThat's what I said, too.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttLet's not even think about it. If I 
tteven mentioned it, he'd -- he'd hit 
ttme, I think.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttAll right.
<b> 
</b>tNow, the thick, tense silence falls between them. They both 
toccupy themselves with their own troubled thoughts. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI want this baby, Julie. I've wanted 
ttthis baby for a long time. It's the 
ttonly thing I've ever asked of 
ttCharlie. If I mentioned that to him 
tt-- I don't know what he'd do. 

tAgain, they sink into silence. Then in the thick silence, 
tthe telephone rings. The two young women are so deep within 
ttheir thoughts that neither of them moves. It rings again, 
tand Helen slides off the couch and goes to the phone. It 
trings again. She picks it up.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttHello.... Hello, Charlie, where are 
ttyou calling from? ... You sound like 
ttyou're having a nice time.... Oh, 
ttyou're having a ball, huh? ... Well, 
ttwhat time do you think you'll be 
ttcoming home?
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. PHONE BOOTH IN EIGHTH STREET BAR
</b>tCharlie in the phone booth, smiling broadly. He seems in 
twonderful spirits. Through the glass of the phone booth we 
tcan see part of the bar and some of the barflies.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttWell, that's what I wanted to call 
ttyou about, honey. I think a couple 
ttof the guys are cutting out now. I 
ttthink Kennie's going home. But I was

ttany special reason.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. THE FOYER
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttJust a minute, Charlie....
<b> 
</b>tShe rises, goes to kitchen door, still holding the phone. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(to Julie) 
ttExcuse me a minute, Julie. It's 
ttCharlie.... 

tShe goes into the kitchen. A little embarrassed, she closes 
tthe kitchen door.

</b><b>tINTERIOR. THE KITCHEN
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(on phone) 
ttCharlie? ... 
ttt(sits) 
ttCharlie, come on home now.... No, I

ttAh, come on.... 
ttt(frowns a little) 
ttWell, no, if you're having such a

tthaving a good time.... I'm not 
ttlonely. Julie's here. We're talking. 
ttI was washing some things.... I 
ttknow, that's what I told you this

ttt(she wets her 
tttlips nervously)

tttsink down onto the 
tttpalm of her free hand) 
ttCharlie, there's no girls at this 
ttparty, are there? ... I'm not

ttmiss you, that's all.... All right, 
ttCharlie, please, I don't want to

ttliving room. ... All right, have a 
ttgood time, stay out as long as you 
ttwant.... All right, Charlie, good-
ttbye.
<b> 
</b>tShe slowly hangs up the receiver, sits slumped and abject.
<b> 
</b>
<b>tINTERIOR. PHONE BOOTH IN EIGHTH STREET BAR
</b>tCharlie in booth. The broad grin has disappeared from his 
tface. As seen through the closed glass doors of the booth, 
the is a very sullen and despondent young man. He stands now, 
tpushes the doors open, and comes out. CAMERA PULLS BACK so 
tthat we can see the whole area of the bar near the phone 
tbooths. Next to the phone booth are two doors marked GUYS 
tand DOLLS. Kenneth is coming in from the deeper recesses of 
tthe bar where the other members of the bachelor party are 
tgrouped in a booth. He is headed for the door marked GUYS. 
tCharlie regards Kenneth bleakly as he approaches.

</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThe party breaking up?

</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(pushing into 
tttthe men's room) 
ttI don't know. I'm going home. You 
ttgoing home?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah, I think so.
<b>   
</b>tHe pushes into the men's room after Kenneth.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. THE MEN'S ROOM 
</b>tA small, white-tiled, yet somehow not too clean, men's room, 
ttwo-urinal size. There is one washbowl with a small mirror 
tover it, and two water closets with doors, separated from 
teach other by a steel partition. Charlie perches on the edge 
tof the washbowl; he apparently came in just to talk. Kenneth 
tmoves off camera for more practical use of the room. CAMERA 
tstays on Charlie who seems depressed, pensive, sad. Stay on 
thim for a long moment. Then ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(frowning) 
ttYou love your wife, Kennie?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH'S VOICE 
</b>ttt(off)
ttWell, I've been married six years. 
ttI've got two kids that keep me awake 
ttall night long. Every Sunday, we go 
ttout driving in Long Island looking 
ttfor a house that's going to take 
ttone, probably two mortgages. I better 
ttlove my wife.
<b> 
</b>tKenneth appears now, edges Charlie away from the wash basin, 
tso he can wash his hands.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI don't feel like going home. Are 
ttyou going? Hang around, Kennie. It's 
ttonly about nine thirty, ten.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttIt's after ten. It's about ten after 
ttten.
<b> 
</b>tKenneth rips off a paper towel. The only noise for a moment 
tis the soft crumpling of paper as Kenneth dries his hands.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttThe party's getting a little wild in 
ttthere anyway. Eddie and Walter got 
ttpoor Arnold nailed in there, they're 
tttrying to talk him into getting a 
ttgirl. This party's going to wind up 
ttin a joint, let me tell you. This is 
tta good time to blow.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(frowning)
ttYeah.... I should have gone to class 
tttonight. I'm paying twenty bucks a 
ttcredit. The least I can do is go to 
ttclass.
<b> 
</b>tHe breaks off abruptly, turning away with a sudden frown.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI take one night off, I can't even 
ttenjoy myself. Did you know Eddie 
ttwent back to Europe? 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttNo, I didn't know that.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHe was telling me he lived in Paris 
ttfor three months. I'd like to do 
ttthat! 

tHe ambles around the men's room, studying himself with 
tunseeing eyes in the little mirror, poking the trash can 
tinto which Kenneth is now dropping his wadded paper towel. 
tHe suddenly turns to Kenneth, stares at him. Kenneth looks 
tat him in mirror.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttWhat's the matter?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm going to quit. What am I 
ttkilling myself for?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttQuit what?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttQuit night school. Tonight was the 
ttfirst laughs I've had in years. I 
ttcan't remember the last time I had 
ttso much fun. Look what I'm missing. 
ttI'm making a pretty good living. I 
ttcan support a wife and baby on what 
ttI make. I'm going to quit! I mean 
ttit. I'm going to quit. Boy, what a 
tttime to have a baby.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYou don't have to quit school 
ttbecause you're having a baby, 
ttCharlie. There are lots of guys go 
ttto night school with two, three 
ttkids.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou ought to meet some of these guys. 
ttThey're just grinding their lives 
ttaway. It's an obsession with some of 
ttthese guys. I mean, what's the point? 
ttSo I'll go five more years to night 
ttschool. So I'll get my degree. So 
ttI'll get a job as a junior accountant 
ttfor three years at seventy-five bucks 
tta week. I'm making better than that 
ttnow. And then it just starts. The 
ttCPA exams. By the time I'm fifty, I 
ttcan start living. At this point, I 
ttget a heart attack and an ulcer, and 
ttthey bury me in the ground, and they 
ttsay: "That was Charlie Samson, the 
ttman who didn't see a movie in fifty 
ttyears." Why go through all that? 
ttI'll quit. I feel so mad right now, 
ttyou better keep an eye on me, Kennie, 
ttbecause I'm going to wind up punching 
ttsomebody.

tThe door opens. Man enters to clean a spot off his tie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttCome on, let's go home.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat do I want to go home for?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYou're in a lousy mood.
<b>   
</b>tThe man, finished with his tie, exits.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttt(after a moment) 
ttCharlie, go home. I can see you're 
ttgoing to get fried tonight and wind 
ttup picking up a tramp and you're 
ttgoing to wake up in the morning 
ttfeeling like two-bits.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt'd be a profit.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttCharlie, about five years ago, I 
ttwent without a job for seven months. 
ttAlice was carrying our first baby. 
ttWe were living on money I borrowed 
ttfrom my brother. I don't know if you 
ttremember me in those days, but it 
ttwas rough. I used to go out every 
ttnight, put a load on, and make a 
ttpass at any girl who looked at me. 
ttAnd I mean any. Big, tall, short, 
ttfat, anything. Well, one night I 
ttpicked up some tomato somewheres, 
ttand we were sitting in a bar or 
ttsomewheres, and I kept calling her 
ttAlice all night. So she says to me: 
tt"My name ain't Alice. Who's Alice?" 
ttSo I said: "Alice is my wife," and 
ttI got up and I went home.
<b> 
</b>tCharlie waits a moment for Kenneth to continue, but 
tapparently this is all Kenneth has to offer at the moment.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat does that mean?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttI don't know. I had a point when I 
ttstarted telling that story.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm not looking for another woman.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttYes, you are, Charlie. You may not 
ttknow it, but you are. So go on home, 
ttCharlie, before you get any drunker 
ttthan you are. Charlie, you start 
ttmessing with other women, something 
ttgoes. It'll kill your marriage. 
ttIt'll kill your wife. It'll just 
ttkill her. What my wife went through 
tt-- well, I don't even want to 
ttremember it. It's never the same 
ttwith your wife again, Charlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm not looking for any woman.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttI think what I was trying to say 
ttwas you stick with your night school. 
ttSome guys have to make peace with 
ttthemselves that they're never going 
ttto amount to too much. A guy like me. 
ttOnce I made that peace with myself, 
ttI found out it doesn't really matter 
ttwhat you amount to. I got a nice 
ttwife and two children I complain 
ttabout all the time, but if anything 
ttever happened to either one of them, 
ttI think I'd die. But you don't have 
ttto make that kind of peace, and 
ttyou'd be crazy to settle for less 
ttthan what you want. You want 
ttsomething, Charlie. I think that's 
ttwonderful.
ttt(Charlie's eyes go 
ttttoward Kenneth) 
ttYou're a little drunk now, and 
ttyou're fed up to the teeth. 
ttEverybody gets fed up, Charlie. You 
ttstick with it. You're going to be all 
ttright.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(touched) 
ttYou're a nice guy, Kennie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttSure. You're a nice guy too.
<b> 
</b>tThe door to the men's room opens, and a Young Man comes in, 
tlooks around quickly at Kenneth and Charlie -- bumps into 
tKennie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttWatch it -- will you, Mac?
<b> 
</b>tCharlie regards this statement a moment. Then advances to 
tthe Young Man.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWait a minute.... What are you, a 
ttwise guy? 

tHe is all set to bust the Young Man one in the nose, but 
tKenneth takes him by the arm.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKENNETH
</b>ttCome on, Charlie, let's go home. 

tCharlie allows himself to be led to the door.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm just about drunk enough right 
ttnow to bust somebody right in the 
ttnose.
<b> 
</b>tKenneth reaches for the knob of the door, opens it, and the 
ttwo men go out. They find themselves in the crowded, noisy 
tbar. A jagged kind of intensity to the atmosphere as if some 
tof the men at the bar might be gangsters. Booths filled with 
tmen and women and some mixed-up types. Kenneth and Charlie 
tmake their way through the bodies down to one of the booths 
twhere Eddie and Arnold are sitting and Walter is standing, 
theavily drunk. Eddie is expostulating to Walter:

tt... Come on, will you? Look Walter, 
ttit's just the shank of the evening! 
ttWhat's so special in your home? You

</b><b> 
</b><b>tEXTERIOR. THIRD STREET 
</b>tThe little stretch of strip-joints on Third Street. Bright 
tlittle cluster of honky-tonks.
<b> 
</b><b>tEXTERIOR. THIRD STREET
</b>tOur bachelor party, now down to four carousers, ambles along 
tthe rather filled sidewalk, looking at the cardboard cutouts 
tof the strippers in the windows of the night clubs.
<b> 
</b>tThe four men pause before one of the strip-joints, examining 
tthe cardboard cutout and billboard which promises first-rate 
tentertainment inside.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. THIRD STREET NIGHT CLUB 
</b>tWe look down on the whole night club, showing the dark, 
tdingy, crowded, smallness of it. There is a strip going on. 
tIt doesn't look very interesting. 

tOur four men are huddled over a very small table in one of 
tthose Third Street clip-joints. It is a dark little hovel, 
tbut a blue stage light drifts across the table, vaguely 
tilluminating our four celebrators. Behind them, a strip 
ttease is in progress. Every now and then, an almost stout 
twoman in her forties, garish in the blue spotlight, dressed 
tin a white satin ill-fitting gown, moves in and out of our 
tview. Half the tables and wall booths are occupied. There is 
ta horseshoe bar off in the recesses of the club. A three-
tpiece band is playing spiritlessly.
<b> 
</b>tWalter is gone, deep in some painful, drunken world of his 
town. Charlie rubs his eyes as if to keep his senses awake. 
tArnold, who is soggy, is leaning toward Eddie, who alone of 
tthe four men is giving any attention to the show.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttSo what do you think of my girl, 
ttEddie? You met her. Be honest with 
ttme. Tell me the truth. I had the 
ttfeeling you didn't like her.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttCome on, come on, Arnold. What do 
ttyou want from me. 

tArnold turns to Charlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttListen, Charlie, I'd like to ask you 
tta little advice. I mean, you're a 
ttmarried man. This girl, I'm supposed 
ttto marry, she's all right, but I'm 
ttnot really attracted to her, you 
ttknow what I mean? That's important,
ttisn't it? I kissed her a couple of 
tttimes, but I ... I don't know why 
ttI'm getting married, Charlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat did you say, Arnold?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI said, I don't know why I'm getting 
ttmarried. I did pretty good for 
ttthirty-two years without getting 
ttmarried. I get along fine at home. 
ttMy mother's a good cook. I have a 
ttnice life. What do I want to break 
ttit all up for?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, Arnold, everybody feels that 
ttway before they get married.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttYeah? Did I ever show you a picture 
ttof my girl?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNo, you didn't, Arnold.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttDo you want to see a picture?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttSure.
<b> 
</b>tArnold clumsily hauls out his wallet and extracts a picture. 
tHe gives it to Charlie who twists at an angle in order to 
tget some light on it.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI want you to give me your honest 
ttimpression, Charlie. She isn't much, 
ttis she?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI can't see much in this light, but 
ttshe looks like a nice pretty girl.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttWell, I wouldn't say that. We were 
ttmatched up, you know. The families 
ttkind of agreed on it. I was brought 
ttover to her by my mother and father. 
ttThat's how I met her. She's some 
ttkind of tenth cousin. She's all 
ttright. She's quiet. I kissed her a 
ttcouple of times. She just sat there 
ttand I kissed her. I think she 
ttexpected more. She even asked me 
ttthat. She said to me: "Are you 
ttafraid of me?" I really don't go out 
ttwith women much. You know. Don't 
tttell nobody this, Charlie, but you 
ttaren't going to believe this, but I 
ttnever ... I mean, you wouldn't 
ttbelieve that a guy of my age, I 
ttnever ... Don't tell anybody I ever 
tttold you this, but I never-- I mean, 
ttCharlie, she's a widow. She's been 
ttmarried already -- she's going to 
ttexpect a lot -- and I never ---- 
ttWhat do you think I ought to do?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat do you mean, Arnold?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI mean, you think I ought to marry 
tther?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, Arnold, even if I knew the 
ttgirl, I wouldn't answer that 
ttquestion. I may not like her, but 
ttshe may be fine for you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttBecause I'm thinking of calling the 
ttwhole thing off.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt's kind of late for that, isn't 
ttit?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI'm scared stiff, Charlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat are you scared about?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI'm not much of a talker, and she's 
ttone of those quiet ones. What are 
ttyou supposed to do with your wife? 
ttI mean, most of the time.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(has to think) 
ttMost of the time, Arnold, you don't 
tteven see her. You're away working. 
ttYou come home, she fixes you supper. 
ttThen one of you washes the dishes. 
ttThen if you're not tired, you can go 
ttto the movies or visit somebody. Or 
ttyou watch teevee.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI do that now with my mother. 

tThis gives Charlie pause.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(scowling) 
ttI don't know what there is to 
ttmarriage. I suppose it's to have 
ttkids.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttSo what do you think I ought to do? 
ttYou think I ought to go through with 
ttthis marriage?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(angry) 
ttArnold, I can't answer that! 

tHe stands abruptly.

<b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>  
</b><b>tEXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT
</b>tOur four amble along Washington Square North, headed west. 
tIn the background, the high apartment houses. It is about 
tmidnight now, and there are a number of people around, and 
tthere are lots of lights in the windows. There is still the 
tfeeling of life. However, some of the wind has gone out of 
tour bachelor party since we last saw them carousing on 
tLexington Avenue. Now, of course, there are only four of 
tthem, and there is somewhat a feeling of straggling about 
tthem.
<b> 
</b><b>tEXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT
</b>tThe four men straggle along Tenth Street east of Seventh 
tAvenue. This is a dark little street. Off at the 
tintersection, you can see Seventh Avenue and an occasional 
tcar moving downtown, but West Tenth Street right now seems 
tan empty, sleeping street of dark and old little apartment 
thouses. The houses sometimes have little stoops. On one of 
tthe stoops, there is a woman sitting. She is in her thirties, 
tnot attractive nor unattractive. She wears a light summer 
tfrock, and she has one shoe off, and she is toying with the 
tidea of pushing the other one off too. As the four men 
tapproach her, she looks up, half quizzically, half 
tquestioningly. The four men note her in passing and seem to 
tcontinue on, but then come to a dragging halt about ten 
tpaces down.
<b> 
</b><b>tCLOSE GROUP SHOT OF THE FOUR MEN.
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttI think we've got one for you, 
ttArnold.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttOne what?
<b> 
</b>tEddie looks back to the woman on the stoop. They all turn to 
tlook. Actually, Charlie has ambled a few paces even further 
tdown and doesn't know quite why they've stopped. They look 
tat the woman; the woman looks at them a little warily. Rest 
tof the scene from her point of view.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttAh, come on, Eddie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttShe ain't bad.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(calling from a 
tttfew paces down) 
ttWhat's the matter?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWe've got a live one.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttt(starting to walk) 
ttCome on, let's go.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttArnold, for Pete's sake.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAh, leave him alone! He doesn't want 
ttto.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttCome on. We've been walking around 
ttall night here -- are you a man, or 
ttain't you? 

tArnold frowns.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttAll right, all right.
<b> 
</b>tWith a scowl, he assumes the responsibility of being a man. 
tThe four men, Charlie bringing up the rear, move down toward 
tThe Woman, who now looks down at her feet and begins wiggling 
ther bare foot back into the unused shoe.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE WOMAN
</b>ttt(not looking up) 
ttI don't know who you fellows think 
ttI am, but you fellows have the 
ttwrong idea about me.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttYeah, I know. Arnold, see that bar 
ttdown the corner. That's where we'll 
ttbe.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE WOMAN 
</b>ttI'm afraid you fellows have the 
ttwrong idea about me.

<b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttShe says we have the wrong idea.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAh, leave him alone.

<b>ttttTHE WOMAN 
</b>ttYou fellows are working under a 
ttmisconception. 

tEddie and Walter have already started down the street to 
tthe bar.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWe'll be in the bar, Arnold.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou all right, Arnold?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttYeah, I'm all right, it's just ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE WOMAN 
</b>ttLook, I'm just sitting here, fellows. 
ttDid I say anything? I was just 
ttsitting here.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttYou want to come with me, Charlie?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNo, Arnold.
<b> 
</b>tCharlie scowls at the suggestion, but there is something 
tpleading in Arnold's face.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou want me to? All right. I'll go 
ttup with you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(from halfway down 
tttthe street) 
ttWhere you going, Charlie?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll go up with him. Moral support.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWhat the---- we'll all go with you. 

tCharlie waves him away.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(walks back to fellows) 
ttWe'll be down at the bar.
<b> 
</b>tCharlie nods. Arnold looks briefly at The Woman and then 
taway again.
<b> 
</b>tShe turns and goes up the steps into the building, her 
tleather heels clicking on the stone steps. Arnold, head 
tdown, and Charlie, a little sheepishly, follow her.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. THE HOUSE
</b>tA dark, ill-lit hallway. A flight of stairs going up, wooden 
trailings, worn carpeting. The Woman starts up the stairs, 
tthe two men following her.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE WOMAN 
</b>ttt(as she goes) 
ttSsshhh....
<b> 
</b>tArnold, wetting his lips, nods. The Woman reaches the first 
tlanding.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. LANDING
</b>tThe Woman has come around to one of the three doors on the 
tlanding and is inserting a key into a lock. Arnold and 
tCharlie appear now at the head of the stairway. The Woman 
tgoes into her room, leaving the door open. A moment later, 
ta shaft of light streams out into the landing. For a moment, 
tnothing happens. Then Arnold and Charlie amble slowly down 
tthe landing to the open doorway and shaft of light.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHey, Arnold, you don't have to go 
ttthrough with this.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI think I should.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll wait out here for you, okay?
<b> 
</b>tArnold nods and goes into the room. He closes the door. 
tCharlie takes out a cigarette and lights it and inhales 
tdeeply. He feels a little sordid. There is the sound of 
tsteps, muffled by the carpeting, coming down the stairs. A 
tman appears coming down from the floor above. He gives 
tCharlie a quick look and continues on down the landing to 
tthe stairs and down again. Charlie scowls at the floor. He 
tsmokes his cigarette.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. THE WOMAN'S ROOM
</b>tIt is a furnished room for which the woman pays eleven 
tdollars a week. It is not particularly unkempt or tarty. 
tThere is a print slipcover on the soft chair and flowers on 
tan end table. There is a studio couch with a neat spread and 
tthrow pillows on it. The Woman stands expressionlessly in 
tfront of the old chest of drawers. She has kicked off one 
tshoe and she is now kicking off the other. She starts to say 
tsomething:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE WOMAN
</b>ttListen, I don't want you to think I 
ttdon't have a job. I got a job. I 
ttwork.
<b> 
</b>tShe stops abruptly as Arnold, who is sitting, eyes averted, 
ton a straight-back wooden chair, suddenly stands up and 
tmoves toward the door.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE WOMAN
</b>ttWhat's the matter?
<b> 
</b>tArnold's lips open to form words, but nothing comes out, and 
the clamps his mouth tight and just stands, miserable and 
twretched. His hand makes a nervous, spasmodic, involuntary 
tgesture, and he quickly clenches his fist. Beads of sweat 
tare on his forehead. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE WOMAN
</b>ttAre you afraid of me?
<b> 
</b>tArnold's head has started to shake nervously, and he opens 
tthe door and steps out into the landing. The Woman, 
tbeginning to get angry, follows him.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. LANDING
</b>tCharlie looks up at the opening of the door and Arnold's 
tentrance. The Woman stands in the doorway. Arnold moves 
tquickly past Charlie about halfway down the landing, white-
tfaced and trembling.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE WOMAN
</b>ttt(getting a 
tttlittle shrill) 
ttWhat's the matter? Hey. Hey, you. 
ttHey, you, what's the matter?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttLet's go.
ttt(to The Woman) 
ttWhat's the trouble?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE WOMAN
</b>ttI don't know. Ask him. What's the 
ttmatter? Hey, you. You, what's the 
ttmatter?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttGo back inside.... All right, all 
ttright.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE WOMAN
</b>ttHow about that, huh?
<b> 
</b>tShe turns angrily, goes back into her room (ad libbing as 
tshe crosses) and slams the door. Charlie moves down the 
tlanding to Arnold, who looks at him wide-eyed, almost in 
tterror.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat happened, Arnold?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI don't know. I'm just scared.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah, I don't blame you, I'd be 
ttscared too like this. I don't know 
ttwhy we dragged you up here in the 
ttfirst place. It's a barbaric custom. 
ttCome on.
<b> 
</b>tHe has taken Arnold's arm and would lead him down the 
tstairs, but Arnold pauses again at the first step.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttDon't tell Eddie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNo I won't, Arnold.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttWhy don't we just sit here for ten
ttminutes or so? 

tCharlie frowns, then shrugs.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAll right, Arnold.
<b> 
</b>tThey both sit slowly on the steps. Arnold is still trembling 
tfrom the whole terrifying experience.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttDon't ever tell anybody.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt's nothing to be ashamed of.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttPlease, Charlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI won't tell anybody.
<b> 
</b>tA man's voice suddenly calls down from an upper floor.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttAnything wrong down there? 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(calling back) 
ttNo. No. Nothing wrong.
<b> 
</b>tCharlie sits. CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER to both men. The whole 
texperience has depressed Charlie, and it shows on his face.
<b> 
</b>tCAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK so that we get the small, sordid 
tfeeling of the two men, somewhat tight, sitting on a dirty 
till-lit staircase outside a whore's bedroom.
<b> 
</b>
<b>tINTERIOR. CORNER BAR
</b>tNeighborhood bar with about ten people in it. Eddie and 
tWalter are two of them. Eddie is playing on one of those 
tbowling machines. He seems surly, ill-tempered, restless.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHey Walter -- you know what we 
ttought to do, don't you? We ought to 
ttgo to that party. Remember that girl 
ttCharlie picked up on Tenth Street?
<b> 
</b>tWalter, who is so drunk he is sober, looks up at Eddie with 
tblurred eyes.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI'm going to die, do you know that?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttNot tonight, Walter. Tonight you're 
ttgoing to live. Ah, these things are 
ttfixed. 
ttt(crosses to bar) 
ttI'm down to my last buck. Got any 
ttmoney on you? 

tHe turns as the door to the bar opens and Charlie and Arnold 
tcome in.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(to Charlie) 
ttHey! 
ttt(to Arnold) 
ttHow'd it go, lover?
ttt(Arnold smiles a 
tttmysterious smile, 
tttpregnant with 
tttsensual meaning) 
ttHey, Charlie, let's go to this party. 
ttIt's only twelve o'clock. Oh, these 
ttparties are mad, man. All the women 
ttwear pajamas, and all the men wear 
ttbeards. Everybody sits on the floor. 
ttArnold, you got any money? I spent 
ttmy last buck on those drinks. How 
ttabout you, Charlie?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttt(assessing his assets) 
ttI got a little over a buck.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWhat are we, all out? So let's go to 
ttthis party then. 
ttt(punches Charlie's arm) 
ttHey, Charlie, come on.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(himself sullen and angry)
ttCut it out.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttYou can have that girl you picked up 
tton Tenth Street. Come on.... All 
ttright, you married men want to be so 
ttmarried that's all right with me. 
ttBut I'd like to see some women 
tttonight.
ttt(punching Charlie's 
tttarm with more hostility 
tttthan he knows) 
ttCome on.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttLay off.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttI'd like to see some women tonight, 
ttyou know. Do you mind?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCut it out, Eddie. You keep punching 
ttme, I swear I'm going to belt you 
ttone.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWhat's the matter with you?
<b> 
</b>tCharlie is off his seat and ready to belt Eddie one right on 
tthe spot. There is abruptly the imminent reality of a fist 
tfight. The two men are just sullen enough. Arnold hurriedly 
tintercedes.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttAll right, all right, fellows.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttLook, don't get so tough with me, 
ttCharlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttAll right, all right, come on.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(angry)
ttI don't want to see any other women!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(just as angry) 
ttAll right! Go on home! Who's holding 
ttyou?! You want to call it a night? 
ttBecause I'm tired of grousing from 
ttone bar to another. You guys go home, 
ttand I'll go about my merry way. All 
ttright? And don't get so tough with 
ttme.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, don't poke me.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttt(turning Charlie 
tttback to his seat) 
ttCome on, let's go ... gee ...
<b> 
</b>tFor a moment, the sudden, thick hostility fills the silence 
tin the room. Nobody says anything. Walter is soddenly 
tpreoccupied with his own thoughts. Arnold is shaken from his 
trecent experience with The Woman and from the flaring of 
ttempers. Charlie just sits bleakly examining a book of 
tmatches he is toying with, trying to bring his temper down. 
tAfter a moment, he mutters:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(mutters)
ttYou mess around with other women, it 
ttkills your wife and it kills your 
ttmarriage.
<b> 
</b>tEddie suddenly, sulkily strides for the door of the bar.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttAll right, you guys go home, and 
ttI'll go on my merry way. 
ttt(gets to the door, 
tttpauses, then turns, 
ttthis sudden hot temper 
tttgone as quickly as 
tttit had come) 
ttHey, you guys, you guys want to go

tArnold shrugs. Eddie has started for the door already.

</b>tLONG SHOT looking down through the length of one almost 
tempty car, through the open door at the end of the car, 
tdown into the next almost empty car. Just a few people 
triding the subway at this hour, half past eleven on a 
tweek-day. But down in the second car, we can see our four 
tcavaliers. Eddie, Arnold, and Charlie are sitting. Our 
tattention is most caught by Walter, who is heavily drunk and 
tweaves and lurches up and down the central aisle of the car. 
tWe cannot hear if he is saying anything.
<b> 
</b>tCLOSE SHOT Walter weaving up and down the aisle of the car. 
tHe stumbles on the toes of a man in a windbreaker, sitting 
tin the car.

ttExcuse me ... excuse me ...
ttt(turns his blurred 
tttattention to Charlie, 
tttwho, alone of the 
tttthree, seems painfully 
tttinterested in what 
tttWalter is talking 
tttabout) 
ttSo what'll I do? I mean, he says, 
ttI'm going to die. I mean, the man's 
tta specialist. He says: "Go to 
ttArizona, go to Colorado," he says. 
tt"You got to get out of New York or 
ttyou're going to die." He tells my 
ttwife, the stupid idiot. My wife 
ttcried all night. I'm going to die, 
ttyou know that? You understand that? 
ttI'm going to die? You know what an

ttout the last time!

ttWalter, why don't you just quit the 
ttjob and pack your bags and get out 
ttof here?
<b> 
</b>tWalter stands in front of Charlie, his lips moving, but no 
twords coming out for a moment. There are tears in his eyes, 
tand all the pain and anguish of the man's forty-eight years 
tare clear on his face.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(getting the words out) 
ttI can't quit. Don't you understand? 
ttYou don't understand. I can't quit! 
ttI got a fourteen-year-old girl, I

ttI worked hard to put that kid in

ttgoing to give me a job? What kind 
ttof a job am I going to get? I'm 
ttforty-eight years old. They don't

ttI make? Who needs me? So this is it. 
ttA man's life, nothing. Worry about

ttthe grave from the day you're born. 
ttThe days drag on, and the years fly

ttt(cries out to 
tttthe whole world) 
ttWhat is it all about? Will you tell

tThe train is slowing up for a station now.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttLife is nothing! It's a gag! It's a

ttto be the first Catholic to be 
ttPresident! Where did it all go?! 

tHe turns to look at the station they are edging into, the 
tyellow lights, the dark shadows, the few blurred faces. His 
tface is wet with the tiny rivulets left by tears. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(mumbling)
ttWhere did it all go? 

tThe train stops, the green doors slide open.

ttI'm going home.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(looking up) 
ttWhat did you say, Walter?

tthe doors are beginning to slide closed again.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(standing) 
ttWalter, where are you going? Come

tOn the platform, Walter has started to weave slowly up the 
tplatform toward the stairway.

ttWhat, did Walter get out?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(calling through 
tttthe open window) 
ttWalter, stay there, we'll come back 
tton the next train. Stay there.
<b> 
</b>tBut Walter has already reached the stairway and, clinging to 
tthe handrail, has started slowly climbing the steps. The 
ttrain starts slowly up. Arnold has stood now too. He is 
tpretty soggy himself.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttPoor Walter, huh?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(bellowing through 
tttthe window) 
ttWalter! ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE

ttHe'll be all right, Charlie. God

<b> 
</b>tThe train is sweeping by the stairway now. Charlie bellows 
tout:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWalter! Grab a cab if you're going 
tthome! 

tThe train has swept by, and in a moment they have been 
tplunged into the tunnel of the subway, the bleak dirty white 
twalls, and the small yellow lights flashing by. Charlie sits 
tdown, somehow greatly shaken and disturbed.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(sits)
ttPoor Walter, I didn't know he was so 
ttsick. I thought there was something 
ttwrong with him, though. He's been 
ttout so much.

ttI didn't know he was so sick. 

tCLOSE IN on Charlie.

<b>ttttCHARLIE

</b>tCLOSEUP of Charlie. Hold for a moment.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tEXTERIOR. FOURTEENTH STREET AND FIRST AVENUE
</b>tWe look down at the subway kiosk as our sad little party of 
tthree comes up the stairs to the sidewalk. It is midnight, 
tand the street is occasionally patrolled by a taxicab. The 
tsidewalks are pretty empty, just a few people walking. 
tPerhaps a drugstore is still open, and its lonely lit store 
tfront catches the eye.
<b> 
</b>tOur three men stand at the head of the stairs at the subway 
tkiosk, drained, tired, a little despondent. Charlie looks up 
tat the dim silhouettes of the endless apartment houses of 
tStuyvesant Town.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThat's where I live.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWhich one?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIn the back there. You can't see it 
ttfrom here. 

tLONG SHOT of Stuyvesant Town as seen from their point of 
tview. PAN SLOWLY ACROSS, capturing the silent monotony of 
tthe dark buildings. Only a few of the windows are still lit.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttIt looks like a state hospital.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt looks like a prison.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttYeah, it does look a little like a 
ttprison. 

tThe three men just stand, worn out, tired.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(suddenly) 
ttI'm going home.
<b> 
</b>tHe starts to walk to the buildings, across the little street 
tthat separates the corner of Fourteenth Street and First 
tAvenue from the parallel corner of the housing project.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(calling after him) 
ttHey, Charlie ... 

tCharlie turns.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHey, Charlie! What about the money? 
ttHave you got ten bucks?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(after a moment) 
ttAll right, if you want to walk me to 
ttthe house, I'll get you ten bucks.
<b> 
</b>tEddie has to take a moment to consider this. Then he 
tshuffles across the little street toward Charlie. Charlie 
tdoesn't quite wait for him to catch up when he turns and 
tleads the way between two cars and up the sidewalk toward 
tthe promenade that leads to the heart of the project. 
tArnold, after a moment, follows Eddie. The three men 
tdisappear single-file into the darkness of Stuyvesant Town.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. LANDING OUTSIDE CHARLIE'S APARTMENT
</b>tWe are looking at the twin elevator doors. The light of an 
televator climbs into the little square window of one of the 
televator doors. The door opens, and Charlie, Eddie, and 
tArnold shuffle out into the landing. They are all a little 
tsoggy.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(mutters) 
ttI'll be right out.
<b> 
</b>tHe moves around the turn of the wall, fishes in his pocket 
tfor the key to his apartment. He finds it, brings it out, 
topens the door carefully, goes into his apartment.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. CHARLIE AND HELEN'S APARTMENT
</b>tCharlie comes in. The dining area is lit, and there is the 
tlamp lit in the living room. As Charlie moves to the living 
troom, we can see that Helen is seated on the couch, 
twatching television. The gray-white light of the television 
tset drifts out into the room. Helen is in her pajamas and 
tshe has washed for bed; her face is devoid of make-up. She 
tis half-watching television; the rest of her attention is 
tdevoted to cutting her fingernails and other aspects of 
tmanicure. She looks up as Charlie comes into the living 
troom, smiles.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttHiya, have a nice time?
<b> 
</b>tCharlie shrugs. He is depressed and can't conceal it.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm taking ten bucks. A couple of 
ttthe guys are waiting outside. I 
ttpromised them I'd loan them ten 
ttbucks.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttSure.
<b> 
</b>tHe stands by the couch now, without interest, automatically 
twatching the television set.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(looking at the set)
ttTomorrow's payday. I'll get it back 
tttomorrow. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttIt's in the drawer.
<b> 
</b>tA kind of ennui has engulfed him. He stands, watching the 
ttelevision set out of which is now pouring the end of an 
tanimated cartoon commercial. Then the familiar tinkling 
tmusic sets in, the inscription, "The Late Show" appears on 
tthe screen, and the announcer's voice informs us that we are 
tnow going back to the late show, starring Rex Harrison in 
t"Strictly Dishonorable." The whole thing brings a wince of 
tpain to Charlie's face, and he turns and moves wearily 
tthrough the little foyer into the darkened bedroom. Enough 
tlight flows in from the other rooms to show Charlie going to 
tthe drawer in the chest of drawers and taking out a 
tten-dollar bill. He returns the other bills, closes the 
tdrawer and just stands there, suddenly so weak and exhausted 
tthat he has to steady himself with one hand on the chest of 
tdrawers.
<b> 
</b>tBack in the living room, Helen still sits, a slight frown 
tnow indicating she is sensitive to the deeply depressed mood 
ther husband is in. She continues with her nails for a moment. 
tThen, wondering what is keeping her husband, she stands and 
tgoes to the bedroom doorway and looks in.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. THE BEDROOM
</b>tCharlie is seated on the bed, hunched, in deep depression. 
tHe is holding the ten-dollar bill. His eyes are open, but 
tthere is a feeling of hurt and pain on his face. Helen moves 
tquietly into the bedroom and sits down on the bed beside him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttWhat's the matter, Charlie? 


tHe shrugs, even smiles briefly. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI don't know.
<b> 
</b>tShe puts out her hand as if to take his head and press it 
tagainst her, but he takes her in his arms almost desperately, 
tand they lie back on the bed, clutching each other, their 
tfaces pressed against each other, seeking some kind of
tstrength just from the sheer physical closeness of each 
tother.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttIt's not so bad, Charlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI know. I know.
<b> 
</b>tThey lie quietly, even stiffly, holding each other.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(eyes wide open 
tttbut unseeing) 
ttI don't know what's the matter with 
ttme, I keep getting so depressed. I'm 
ttgoing to quit night school, Helen. 
ttMy nerves are shot.
<b> 
</b>tHe releases himself from his wife's embrace and sits up.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThose guys are waiting outside. I 
ttbetter give them their money.
<b> 
</b>tHe stands and starts out the bedroom.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttCharlie ... Maybe I shouldn't have 
ttthe baby?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat do you mean? ...
<b> 
</b>tShe doesn't answer. She doesn't have to. They both know what 
tshe means.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIsn't that dangerous? ... Well, I 
ttdon't know ... maybe ... Well, you 
ttbrought it up. 

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(shocked -- after 
ttta moment) 
ttYou really don't want this baby....
<b> 
</b>tShe turns away on the bed to hide the sudden flush of tears.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttYou're my husband, Charlie. This is 
ttyour baby too. That doesn't mean 
ttanything to you. For the first time 
ttin our marriage I feel I can't 
ttdepend on you, Charlie -- I'm not 
ttimportant to you.
ttt(she has to stop 
tttbecause she can no 
tttlonger trust her 
tttvoice. After a 
tttmoment she continues) 
ttI could make my life sound hard, too, 
ttCharlie. I work all day, I rush home, 
ttI make you dinner. I sit home alone 
ttfour nights a week, I'm even alone 
ttwhen you're here because when do I 
ttsee you? But it was easy for me 
ttbecause I loved you. Do you think I 
ttcare whether you're an accountant or 
tta ditch digger, or even out of work? 
ttAll I ever wanted was you. And this 
ttbaby because it's you, too.
<b> 
</b>tShe closes her eyes again to hide the warm flow of tears in 
ther eyes and stops talking rather than cry. Charlie sits, 
tunmoved and wretched, his shoulders hunched, his head 
tslumped forward. After a moment, he turns and reaches 
tforward, quite frightened, to touch her arm.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(dully) 
ttLeave me alone, Charlie.
<b> 
</b>tHe stands and goes to the bedroom window and looks out. 
tHelen turns on her side so that her back is to him. At the 
tsound of her moving, Charlie turns his head, but sensing the 
trejection in her back, he turns back and looks out the 
twindow again. The silence is thick between them.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(looking out 
tttthe window) 
ttI decided I'd quit school and ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI don't care ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI decided I'd quit school and come 
tthome in the evenings like everybody 
ttelse and live a normal life.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(staring at the 
tttwall ahead of her) 
ttI don't care what you do, Charlie. 

tHe stands another moment.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI don't care what I do either.
<b> 
</b>tHelen neither moves nor makes a response. Charlie goes on 
tinto the living room and shuffles to the front door, his 
tlong body heavy with pain and guilt and dense, unknown 
tterrors. He opens the door and goes out onto the landing.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. LANDING
</b>tEddie and Arnold, looking up as the door opens and Charlie 
tcomes out.

ttI'll give it to you tomorrow. I'll

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll see you.
<b> 
</b>tEddie takes Arnold's arm and guides him back around the turn 
tof the wall to the elevators. Charlie follows a few paces 
tbehind. Eddie pushes both elevator buttons. Charlie nods, 
tlooks down at the tiling at his feet, fairly sick within 
thimself, oppressed and guilty. The light in the elevator 
twindow shows, and Eddie opens the door.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWait a minute. I'll go with you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttLet's go to that party -- we'll 
tthave a ball!
<b> 
</b>tCharlie shuffles the few paces forward and follows Eddie and 
tArnold into the elevator. The door closes, and, a moment 
tlater, the light of the elevator cage disappears downward.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. GREENWICH VILLAGE DUPLEX APARTMENT
</b>tThis is one of those duplex apartments on West Tenth Street 
twhich consists of one huge living room that is two stories 
thigh and you need a little rolling stepladder to reach the 
tbooks on the upper shelves of the built-in bookcases. There 
tis a little wrought-iron stairway that leads to the second 
tfloor, which consists of two tiny little bedrooms. 

tApartments like these, as is the case in this one, are 
tusually lived in by two girls, one of whom is a secretary in 
tan advertising agency and the other a model for a garment 
tmanufacturing firm. Both girls are in their early thirties 
tand are milling about somewhere in the mass of people in the 
tliving room, carrying drinks, laughing up a storm, pausing 
tat the little knots of discussion groups with an apt phrase. 
tThey rather think of themselves as Madame de Staxebls with 
ttheir own salon of bright young people, for most of the men 
tand women at the party are in some way connected with the 
tarts, probably in an avant garde way. It is a little 
tdifficult to tell this by looking at them because avant 
tgarde artists have become obsessed with dressing like 
tbusinessmen, but if you can hear the talk as we can, you get 
tthe point fast enough. We pick up phrases like: "I really 
tfind it difficult to think of Tennessee Williams as a 
tserious artist," or "My teacher thinks all tenors are frogs 
texcept Gigli," or "I don't see how you can say that; his 
tdesigns fairly throb with sex." There are, as Eddie 
tpredicted, a number of people sitting on the floor, mostly 
tgirls, circled in the swirl of their Ann Fogarty dresses, 
tand there is one obvious ballerina, with her black hair 
tpulled tightly back into a severe pony tail, using the 
twrought-iron railing that separates the dropped living room 
tfrom the small entrance foyer to demonstrate something about 
tpositions at the dancing bar. There is someone at the piano 
tbanging away, shouting his songs, but he is completely 
tinaudible five feet away. A few people lean over the piano, 
tapparently exhilarated by the songs. Thin blankets of smoke 
twreathe their way up to the two-story-high ceiling. We catch 
tsome more phrases: "I thought Truman Capote was supposed to 
tbe here." -- "Truman's in Russia, I think." -- "Good 
theavens, what can the Russians want with Truman Capote?" -- 
t"Oh, I never read anything published in this country." "Oh, 
tI mean, the paper-bound Paris edition." In short, this is a 
treal chi-chi wingding where all the furniture is too low, 
tand the hostess is very proud of the fact that her end table 
tis made out of an orange crate.

tSomewhere, through the jumble of the party, we can hear the 
tdoorbell chime. A young woman, at one of the little knots of 
tpeople, perks her ears and says: 

<b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttI'm sure that's the police again.
<b> 
</b>tShe's very proud of this. She turns and weaves her way 
tthrough the crowded room, carrying her drink. She goes up 
tthe step to the entrance foyer, turns to her left, picks her 
tway over two middle-aged men who are both throwing a pitch 
tat a fairly tight girl of eighteen, past the kitchen, which 
tis a bedlam of ice cubes and kitchen towels and which is 
toccupied at the moment by two intense women in their late 
tthirties wrapped in deep discussion, up past two young men 
twho have no immediate use for girls, to the front door of 
tthe apartment. She opens the door.
<b> 
</b>tGROUP SHOT of Eddie, Arnold, and Charlie from the Hostess's 
tpoint of view. Not exactly a heartening sight to most 
thostesses, three fairly loaded young men with their collars 
tunbuttoned and their ties limp and dangling.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttt(beaming) 
ttAre you coming to complain about the 
ttnoise?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttDo we look like complainers?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHOSTESS 
</b>ttI don't know who you are, but come 
ttin, come in. I don't know half the 
ttpeople who are here tonight. 

tThey enter a little warily and ill-at-ease, peering into the 
tjammed room.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttThe police have been here twice. The 
ttfirst fellow was just adorable. We 
ttgave him a drink, and he's upstairs 
ttin a bedroom now, for all I know.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttIs that right?

<b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttIf you want something to drink, 
ttyou'll just have to go into the 
ttkitchen and get it yourself. The 
ttplace is just mad. Do you write, 
ttpaint or sing?
<b> 
</b>tEddie spreads his arms in all-inclusive expansiveness.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttEverything.
<b> 
</b>tBut the hostess has already bent to chat with two women, one 
told, one young, sitting on the floor. Our three cavaliers 
tlook at each other and then look out over the wild, jumbled 
troom.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBoy, do you get invited to a party 
ttlike this or do you get committed?
<b> 
</b>tA passing young man who overhears this, pokes his head into 
tthe group and says to Charlie with a flashing smile:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttYOUNG CHAP
</b>ttI heard that. It's awfully funny. 

tCharlie regards the smiling young chap.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttBeat it.
<b> 
</b>tThe chap's smile flashes off and he scurries away. Eddie 
trubs his palms and surveys the women in the crowded room 
twith a measuring eye.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttThis is going to be like shooting 
ttducks. Pick out your duck, men.

tthe party, an occasional shrill laugh.

tdrinks. He picks his way through the people to the living 
troom with the general intention of getting to the 
tarrangement of divans around the coffee table, when he spots 
tCharlie and moves across to him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHey, what's the matter, Charlie? 
ttt(squats down 
tttbeside Charlie)
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(without looking up) 
ttLet's get out of here, Eddie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttThe last time I saw you, you was 
ttwith that girl you picked up. What 
tthappened?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttShe's over there talking to that 
ttold guy with the glasses. 

tTheir point of view, The Existentialist on steps with 
tlandlord.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI didn't like her. She's one of 
ttthese real Greenwich Village phonies. 
ttIf I added up all the guys she told 
ttme about, she must have had her 
ttfirst boy friend when she was two 
ttyears old. Where are you going, 
ttEddie. Stick around a minute.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(who has stood) 
ttI'm with that one over there -- not 
ttbad, huh? I think she's a Communist. 
ttI think she's trying to talk me into 
ttjoining the Party.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHow are you making out?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttNot so hot. I may have to join.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHang around. Let's talk a bit.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttI better get back. She's liable to 
ttrecruit somebody else.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhere's Arnold?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHe's in the kitchen. I think he's 
ttout cold. I'll see you. 

tCharlie nods as Eddie moves off. He returns his morose 
tattention back to his glass of liquor. Then his eyes close, 
tand his face, though impassive, shows pain. After a moment, 
the opens his eyes and slowly clambers to his feet and makes 
this way, a little unsteadily, through the living room in the 
tdirection of the kitchen. In the background we can hear the 
tpiano and somebody singing indistinguishable lyrics. Charlie 
tgets to the kitchen door and looks in. Arnold is at the tiny 
tkitchen table, head on the table, out cold. The kitchen is 
tin a state of havoc.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHey Arnold-- You okay, Arnold? 

tArnold makes no answer. Charlie regards his prostrated 
tfriend expressionlessly for a moment. Then turns and 
tshuffles aimlessly back to the group around the piano in the 
tliving room. He looks over to the stairway again. The 
tExistentialist is alone now, The Landlord having gone for 
tthe moment. She is looking at Charlie, and he drops his eyes. 
tHe turns away from the piano and moves out a few steps into 
tthe middle of the living room. He moves to the stairway. 
tThe Existentialist looks up at him as he approaches, Charlie 
tkind of nods to her, and, for a moment, she just sits and he 
tjust stands. Then ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttThat old man I was talking to before? 
ttThat's my landlord. About ten thirty 
ttlast night, someone began pounding on 
ttmy door. So I got up and opened the 
ttdoor, and there was this white-haired 
ttman with  a pince-nez standing there. 
ttI said: "What do you want?" So he 
ttsaid: "I'm the landlord, and I want 
ttthe rent." Well, I just looked at him 
ttbecause the landlord I knew was a 
ttHungarian man named Frank, who was 
ttcrazy about me, and the issue of rent 
ttnever came up, you see. Well, it 
ttturned out that this man with the 
ttpince-nez had just bought the 
ttbuilding the day before and he kept 
ttgrabbing my arm and saying he wanted 
ttthe rent. Well, then I got the point, 
ttof course. Well, meanwhile, a boy 
ttnamed Bob I knew had come over. He's 
ttengaged to a Javanese girl with 
ttwonderful planes in her face who 
ttlives at the International House. 
ttBut he's crazy about me and he drops 
ttin about twice a week. Well, 
ttmeanwhile, my new landlord was 
ttgrabbing my arm and kept quoting 
ttpoetry to me which he was trying to 
ttpass off as his own. He was an 
ttabsolute fraud. He scotched the 
ttwhole thing from Baudelaire. "Tu 
ttmettrais." You know that one. Well, 
tthe kept screaming about the rent -- 
ttI didn't like him, you know -- and I 
ttcalled this boy named George who 
ttused to live in Poughkeepsie when I 
ttwas going to Vassar, and he's crazy 
ttabout me. He lives in St. Luke's 
ttplace now, but he goes to 
ttPoughkeepsie every Wednesday to see 
tthis mother, he's got an Oedipus, so 
ttthat was out. Well, my new landlord 
ttkept telling me how much he was in 
ttlove with me. I said: "How 
ttexistentialist can you get? You just 
ttmet me five minutes ago." He was 
ttabsolutely crazy about me.
<b> 
</b>tCharlie has been sort of half-listening to all this. His 
tattention, if any at all, has been vaguely given to the 
tgirl's bare arms, the lines of her body. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(resigned) 
ttYou have an apartment around here 
ttsomewheres? 
ttt(looks up to 
tttsecond floor) 
ttWhat's up there? What kind of rooms 
ttare up there?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttSo, I finally got to sleep around 
ttsix thirty.... 

tCharlie bends down to her, takes her arm.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCome on, let's go. 

<b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttt(wrenching her 
tttarm away) 
ttNo! Oh, stop trying to be so 
ttprimitive. 

tCharlie straightens with an irritated sigh.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttI find you very unpleasant. 

tHe stands, she sits in sullen silence.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttThere's nothing upstairs. 
ttt(suddenly rises, 
tttmumbles) 
ttOh, I don't care.
<b> 
</b>tShe starts up the stairs, Charlie following close behind her. 
tThey pick their way past the other people sitting on the 
tstairs to the second-floor landing. They walk in hostile 
tsilence down the landing to the bedroom door, which she 
topens.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. THE BEDROOM
</b>tIt is a tiny bedroom. The bed is covered with purses and 
tsummer stoles and other guest things. An uncovered, 
timprovised closet, really a rack of hanging dresses and 
tthings, gives the room an overburdened look. Charlie comes 
tinto the room after her, closes the door, looks for the 
tlatch. She pushes some of the things on the bed aside and 
tsits down and waits while Charlie latches the door, a matter 
tof turning a bent nail into locking position. She begins to 
tprattle again.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttSo I finally got to sleep around six 
ttthirty this morning. At nine thirty, 
ttsomeone began pounding on my door 
ttagain. I got out of bed and opened 
ttthe door, and there was my landlord 
ttwith the pince-nez wearing a blue 
ttsilk kimono. "Oh, for heaven's 
ttsakes," I said, "what do you want 
ttnow?" He said: "I'm the landlord, 
ttand I want the rent." I said: 
tt"You're an old man, go to sleep." 
ttThen the phone rang. It was a boy 
ttnamed Andrew I know who teaches 
ttphysics at Columbia University, and 
tthe's insanely jealous. He's married 
ttand has four children, but he keeps 
ttbadgering me to run away with him to 
ttNicaragua, throw up his professorship 
ttand all that. Well, my landlord began 
ttshouting some garbled Baudelaire at 
ttthe top of his lungs, and a little 
ttVerlaine, and a little Huysmans. He 
ttapparently has some kind of fetish 
ttabout French decadents. And 
ttnaturally, Andrew heard him, and he 
ttgot furious, and he said: "Who's that 
ttI hear?" I said, "That's the 
ttlandlord." He said: "What does he 
ttwant?" I said: "He wants the rent." 
ttWell, at this point, I felt like 
ttchucking the whole business and 
ttgoing back to Bessemer City and 
ttgoing to work in my father's 
tthardware store.
<b> 
</b>tCharlie has stood a moment, listening to this bizarre story. 
tThen he has busied himself cleaning a place beside The 
tExistentialist on the bed. He brings an end to the rococo 
tnarration by putting his arms around The Existentialist and 
tin a moment, she responds hungrily.
<b> 
</b>tCLOSEUP of Charlie and The Existentialist in a desperate 
tembrace.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttt(muttering) 
ttJust say you love me.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttJust say you love me. You don't have 
ttto mean it. 

tHe tries to kiss her again, himself charged high at the 
tmoment, but she turns her face away from him. The dialogue 
tis intense, whispered, hungry.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttNo, don't. ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat's the matter?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttSay you love me....
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCome on.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttSay you love me....
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE

</b>ttNo ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI love you! I love you!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHE EXISTENTIALIST
</b>ttt(content)
ttLook, maybe we ought to go someplace
ttelse? I'm having a very tricky thing 
ttgoing with my landlord and I don't 
ttwant him to see us leaving together. 
ttSo you know what you do? There's a 
ttbar down the street. You go out the

ttknow the one I mean?  
<b>

ttas fast as I can. Now, wait for me 
ttnow, because I can't stand being 
ttalone at night. You'll like me. I'm 
ttsupposed to be very amusing. All 
ttright?
<b> 
</b>tShe turns abruptly and goes out the door. He stands for a 
tmoment and then follows. He stands on the upper landing, 
twatching her pick her way down the stairs into the living 
troom.
<b> 
</b>tShe looks quickly around the room, apparently finds whom she 
tis looking for, and moves quickly to a little group of men, 
tone of whom is about sixty years old with a thin elegance 
tand a cruel face, the landlord. He has several young men 
taround him, all rather frail, Ivy-Leagueish. She joins the 
tgroup, to the distaste of the young men, and is immediately 
tvoluble and gesticulatory. After a moment, Charlie lets his 
teyes wander over the room, apparently sees Eddie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(calling down) 
ttHey, Eddie ...
<b> 
</b>tApparently, Eddie doesn't hear him. Charlie frowns and 
tbegins making his own way down the stairs to the living room.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. LIVING ROOM -- GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT
</b>tCharlie moves down the stairs into the living room proper. 
tHe makes his way to Eddie, who is still sitting in the back 
tof the room, throwing an intense pitch at his girl, talking 
tquickly, smiling, gesturing. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(muttering) 
ttEddie, I'm cutting out.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(standing, low voice) 
ttWait a minute, I'll go with you.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI don't want to take you away from 
ttyour girl, Eddie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttAah, this one lives out in Long 
ttIsland with her mother. What kind of 
ttCommunist is that? It'll take me a 
tthalf hour on the subway there and a 
tthalf hour back.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(shrugs) 
ttWhere's Arnold? Still in the kitchen?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttI guess so. 
ttt(to the girl) 
ttI'll see you, next time I get to 
ttLong Island. 

tHe starts off after Charlie who is already wandering through 
tthe living room in the general direction of the kitchen, 
tlooking about for Arnold. They pass The Existentialist en 
troute. She is saying: "... this boy named Charlie, I never 
tsaw him before in my life, has been clutching at me all 
tevening. He's absolutely insane about me." Charlie leans 
tinto the kitchen where Arnold is awake now, seated at the 
tsmall kitchen table, staring gauntly, unseeingly at his 
tfingers on the white porcelain-topped table. There are two 
tmen, one middle-aged, one young, having a whispered chat 
tover the sink.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(over Charlie's 
tttshoulder) 
ttHey, Arnold, come on.
<b> 
</b>tArnold stands obediently, almost dumbly. He squeezes around 
tthe table, his face soddenly expressionless, to join Eddie 
tand Charlie in the kitchen doorway. Eddie is saying to 
tCharlie:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWell, it wasn't a bad party. We 
ttkilled a couple of hours anyway.
<b> 
</b>tThe three men push their way past three women in their 
tthirties, who are standing in the little hallway before the 
tfront door, in earnest brow-furrowed conversation with each 
tother. Charlie opens the door, and the three morose 
tcarousers go out into the dark street.

</b>tThe three carousers come out into the street. The door 
tcloses behind them. The night air is hot and muggy. They 
twalk down the street toward the corner where only the light 
tof the corner bar gives any indication of life. There is a 
tnewspaper on the sidewalk which Eddie bends down to pick up, 
tand the three men straggle to a halt. Eddie opens the paper 
tto the sports pages and starts to read by the light of the 
tstreet lamp. Arnold moves a step to the lamp and leans 
tagainst it. Charlie stands in the middle of the sidewalk, a 
tmelancholy, pondering young man. The evening seems to have 
tcome to a dead halt. After a moment, Eddie starts walking 
tagain, reading the paper as he does. The others slowly 
tgather themselves and follow him.

tPANS DOWN the wall. We are in the bar on the corner of Tenth 
tand Sixth, almost entirely empty except for Charlie, Eddie,

twearily on the bar over their beers; the only other person 
tin the bar is a worn, battered old veteran of the streets, a 
twoman in her forties, bespectacled, who is perched on a bar 
tstool at the far end of the bar, gloomily reading a 
tnewspaper. CAMERA MOVES DOWN and IN on Charlie, Eddie, and

ttthe whole deal. 
ttt(back to Charlie) 
ttAll right Hodges is having a bad

tthit over .300. He only hit thirty-

</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttSo, Eddie...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttArnold! Get rid of her! You're

tArnold lowers his head, and he rises, loses his precarious 
tbalance and moves backward a few lurching steps.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttt(continuing) 
ttAll right, who's on second? We got 
ttCharlie Neal or Gilliam, for that

tdown the length of the bar to the door. They exit. The door 
tshuts behind them. For a moment, Eddie regards the closed 
tdoor. Then he shuffles to the bar, back to his schooner of 
tbeer and looks at it without taking it up. He is profoundly 
tweary. His shoulders slump, his face sags. He runs his hand 
tdown his face and shakes his head as if to clear it. He 
tturns and looks down to the other end of the bar where the

toutside the bar Arnold and Charlie have just come out of. 
tThere is a house with a small stoop, and Arnold is standing 
tslumped by the stoop, holding himself up by the iron railing. 
tHe is being sick, quietly retching. Charlie is standing a few 
tpaces away from him in the middle of the sidewalk, a deeply 
tunhappy figure in his own right. From our angle, we may or 
tmay not be able to tell that Charlie is crying.
<b> 
</b>tCLOSE SHOT of Charlie standing in the middle of the sidewalk 
tof Sixth Avenue and Tenth Street, the whole dark world around 
thim, silent and empty. He is crying quietly, unashamedly, his 
tshoulders shaking ever so little.  Behind him, Arnold is bent 
tover the railing of the stoop, weak and spent.

</b>tANOTHER SHOT of the two men. Charlie stops crying, sighs, and 
tstarts toward Arnold.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(gently) 
ttAre you all right, Arnold?

</b>tArnold nods weakly. Charlie gets out a handkerchief and 
tgives it to Arnold who begins to weakly clean his chin and 
tspots on his suit.

tArnold shakes his head weakly "no."
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat subway do you take, Arnold,

</b>tArnold nods weakly. Charlie puts his arm supportively around 
this friend's back, but Arnold makes no move yet, being 
tthoroughly drained.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCome on, Arnold, I'll take you home.
<b> 
</b>tThere is a clicking of high heels on concrete pavement, and 
tCharlie looks up. The Existentialist has just come out of 
tthe party several houses down and has come up a few steps 
tand is standing watching them. She has her bag and her light 
tsummer stole. She nods to Charlie, sort of smiles, moves a 
tfew steps closer to them.

<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(nods) 
ttYeah, he's all right. Look, I've got 
ttto take my friend home...
<b> 
</b>tThe two men start slowly down the street to the corner. 
tArnold leaning heavily on his friend. The Existentialist 
tstands, watching them a moment.

</b>ttt(calling lightly) 
ttAre you coming back? Where does he 
ttlive? How long will you be?

tcorner. Charlie hasn't heard her.

tshe hurries back to the house where the party is.
<b> 
</b><b>tINTERIOR. BMT SUBWAY -- HURTLING NORTHWARD
</b>tHalf past three, and the car is absolutely empty except for 
tCharlie and Arnold. Arnold is sprawled across the straw seat, 
tone leg buckled beneath him, the other on the floor. He is 
tsleeping heavily. Charlie sits expressionlessly, obviously 
tinvolved in deep introspection. The car buckets along into 
tthe night.

</b>tArnold and Charlie coming up to a landing. It is the third 
tfloor; we can see enough of the corridor to see two 
tapartment doors, lettered "3D" and "3C." A small overhead 
tbulb provides a thin sketchy light. Charlie and Arnold 
tshuffle down the landing to apartment 3D. They pause outside 
tthe door. The scene is played in low mutters and whispers.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttWell, thanks a lot, Charlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou all right?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttYeah, I'm all right. I'm a little 
ttgroggy, but I'm awake anyway. You 
ttdon't want to come in, do you?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNo, I don't think so.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI think my father and mother are up. 
ttI hear voices. My girl must have 
ttcalled them because they wouldn't 
ttbe up at this hour.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, you just go in and explain to 
ttthem that you were drunk, and you're 
ttsorry, and you'll call your girl the 
ttfirst thing in the morning because 
ttshe must really be upset about this.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttt(who has been 
tttlistening at 
ttthis door) 
ttI think she's here.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWho?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttMy girl. I think I hear her voice in 
ttthere.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, be nice to her, Arnold. 
ttRemember, you woke her up in the 
ttmiddle of the night and probably 
ttscared her to death.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttWhat'll I say to her, Charlie?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI don't know, Arnold. What do you 
ttfeel like saying to her? Do you 
ttreally love this girl? Do you want 
ttto marry her? Are you marrying this 
ttgirl because your family wants you 
ttto marry her, or why?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI think I like her, Charlie. It's 
ttjust that I'm afraid I won't make a 
ttgood husband.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, tell her what you told me, 
ttArnold. Tell her you're scared, and 
ttthat you don't think you'll make a 
ttgood husband. If she's a halfway 
ttdecent girl, she'll try to understand 
tthow you feel, and, if she loves you, 
ttshe's going to make it her job to 
ttmake you happy. That's what love is, 
ttArnold, when you have somebody else 
ttin the world you want to be happy. 
ttMy wife, Arnold, I don't know what 
ttI'd do without her. Arnold, I've got 
tta tough grind ahead of me. Work all 
ttday, I'll go to night school at night. 
ttBut my wife knows that I need this to 
ttbe happy, and she does everything she 
ttknows to help me. And we've got a 
ttbaby coming. But if you love that 
ttbaby and you love your wife, then 
ttit's easy. Everything seems so easy 
ttto me now -- I don't know why I even 
ttthought of quitting.
ttt(tears have welled 
tttin his eyes, and he 
ttthurriedly puts his 
ttthand to his face 
tttshading his reddening 
ttteyes) 
ttArnold, I want my wife so much right 
ttnow. I want her to be happy. I want
ttto just go home and hold her and tell 
tther how much she means to me. I mean, 
tteven Walter, he's going to die, but 
ttdon't you think he'll be in tomorrow 
ttmorning, same old Walter, jokes and 
ttlaughs? He's got somebody to live 
ttfor. He's even got somebody to die 
ttfor. I mean, how rich can a man be? 
ttAnd poor Eddie -- I used to be so 
ttjealous of him. I used to think he 
ttwas so free. Free from what? From 
ttloving a woman, from really wanting
tta woman. Arnold, what I'm trying to 
tttell you is life is nothing if you 
ttdon't love somebody but life is 
ttwonderful if you do love somebody. 
ttArnold, I want my wife so much right 
ttnow ...
<b> 
</b>tArnold is a little embarrassed by his friend's display of 
temotion and, frankly, hasn't understood a word Charlie was 
ttalking about.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI'm going to tell her about that 
ttwoman tonight and everything. I'll 
tttell her about that woman.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttArnold, I want to get home so much 
ttto my wife right now I'm going to 
ttbust.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI'll see you, Charlie.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttGood-bye, Arnold, have a nice 
tthoneymoon. I'll see you when you get 
ttback.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttI'll see you, Charlie.
<b> 
</b>tBut he is talking to an empty staircase. Charlie has plunged 
tdown into the darkness of the floor below. Arnold turns and 
tsighs and shuffles back to the door of his apartment. He 
trings the bell lightly, takes a deep breath. A moment, and 
tthe door opens. A girl of about thirty-five, bespectacled, 
trather plain, with a sensitive face, stands in the doorway. 
tArnold stands, his head down in shame.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNOLD
</b>ttHello, Louise. I'm very sorry, 
tthonest.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>ttSure, Arnold, I know.
<b> 
</b>tShe looks anxiously over Arnold's shoulder to see if anyone 
telse is there. Arnold lumbers past her into the apartment. 
tVoices, both male and female, pop out at him. "What's the 
tmatter with you, are you crazy?" "What's the matter with 
tyou?" "For heaven's sakes, where have you been?" ... The 
tdoor closes.

tits endless little pathways winding from the various 
tapartment house doors to the central pathway which leads to 
ta stairway to the street. It is half past five in the morning. 
tThe sky is gray and desolate. The courtyard and any other 
tstreet we see is absolutely empty. THE CAMERA PANS OVER this 
tempty expanse to the stairway where Charlie appears now, 
tcoming quickly up the steps. He moves down the central 
tsidewalk, a little faster than he would usually walk; you have 
tthe feeling he is exerting an effort to keep from running.

tThe door opens and Charlie comes in. He closes the door 
tquietly after himself and moves a few steps into the 
tapartment. He stops when he sees Helen seated on the couch, 
twearing a kimono over her pajamas. She stands; she has been
tcrying.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI love you, Helen.

</b>tShe moves slowly to him and puts her head on his chest and 
tcries quietly. He holds her tightly.
