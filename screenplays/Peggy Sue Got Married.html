tCLOSE VIEW INTO THE KITCHEN - First we see a woman's hand, on
tthe floor. It is partially covered with flour.

tMOVING VIEW reveals PEGGY BODELL, in her early 40's, fainted
tfrom heartbreak while baking a cake. Flour is scattered on
tthe floor. She recovers from her faint. Confused, she
tsteadies herself and brushes the flour from her dress.

<b>tINT. GARAGE -- DAY
</b>
tPeggy's son, SCOTT, 16, is playing an old reel to reel tape
trecorder. There are stacks of boxes filled with personal

tCHARLIE BODELL, early 40's, singing the same song. He can't
thit a high note, turns off the water and steps out of the

</b>ttGoddamnit, I just can't hit those
tthigh notes anymore.

</b>ttDid I hear 70 dollars? What do you 
ttneed 50 dollars for? How's your

tPeggy comes out of the kitchen. Charlie has stopped
tconspicuously at the threshold. A workman comes from behind
tPeggy.

</b>ttWell, today's Saturday and it's
ttstill not here.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttJesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not
ttused to that stuff. You always did
ttthe bills. Blame the damn post
ttoffice.

tA workman approaches carrying an old mono record player:
tblack and white, a real fifties artifact. For a moment their
tmutual resentment melts, as they look at each other.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttThat stays.

tThe workman looks to Charlie for approval. Charlie nods. The
tworkman shrugs, and heads back to the basement.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou got a Tab?

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI don't buy them anymore. You were
ttthe only one who drank them.

tPeggy leads the way. At the far end, she flips a light switch
tthat turns on a wall sculpture of lava lamps.

</b>ttYou don't want them? They're going
ttto make a big comeback any minute.
ttMark my words, these lamps are
ttgoing to...

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI know. Put Scott through college.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll think of a way to sell, them.
ttt(beat)
ttOne day.

tPeggy opens a box filled with records. She closes it and
tmoves to another. Charlie checks the contents of another box
ton the other side of the room.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttAre you taking Janet to the reunion
tttonight?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm not going.

tScott calls from the top of the stairs.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttCome on Dad!

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBe right there. I'll go through the
ttrest of this stuff next weekend.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttBye Mom.

</b>ttBye sweetheart.

tPeggy and Charlie look at each other as Scott leaves.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(with real, regret)
ttI never thought it would go
ttthis far.

tCharlie exits. Peggy looks around. She slaps the flap of a
tbox down, to close it, but it jumps back up.

tjumps out and opens the door of the shop. Peggy stacks the
tboxes in Beth's arms and opens the door for her.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttIf the pastries aren't here by nine
ttthirty, call Monica and threaten
tther life.

tPeggy gets into the car, and blows a kiss to Beth.

</b>ttShe's almost a juvenile delinquent.

tMr. Kelcher gives Nancy a look and points to the door.
tWithout her father noticing, Nancy creeps up behind him and
tmakes rabbit ears behind his head. Charlie tries hard not to
tlaugh. Nancy continues to clown.

tPeggy picks it up, excited.

tINSERT: MATCHBOOK which reads: FINISH HIGH SCHOOL IN YOUR

tWith all the aplomb of a divorcee, Peggy takes a quarter and

tPeggy approaches him, holding up a joint, smiling

ttakes the joint and inhales.

tPeggy takes off her sweater, kicks off her shoes and begins
tto dance. Her eyes are closed, her body silhouetted by the

tA breeze blows through the open window Peggy sleeps fitfully,
ttossing off the covers. We HEAR NOISES from outside her

tbedroom. Peggy mumbles Charlie's name. The man walks over to
ther bed as Peggy reaches out for him, tenderly, as if they
twere still married.

tCharlie exits. Peggy slumps back, drained. Getting up, she
tcrosses to the mounted swordfish. Standing on a chair she
treaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a package of
tPall Malls. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and picks up a

tPeggy starts to shift in the chair. Her shorts hike up, her

</b>ttIn the future, will you have to
ttmarry a girl before you have sex

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI'd forgotten how much music meant
ttto you.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThat's real big of you.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttStop being defensive. I want to
tthelp you. I wrote a song for you.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou're kidding. You wrote a song?
ttIs it about a guilty girl and a
tttrusting guy... she wants to hurt
tthim, and he wonders why?

tPeggy takes a piece of paper from her purse.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttNot exactly, but with your great
ttvoice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttFat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins
ttcame to hear me last night. He told
ttme to forget it. You told me to
ttforget it. My parents tell me to
ttforget it.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttJust take a look at it.
ttt(hands him the lyric)

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIf you took the trouble to write
ttit, then sure, I'll take a look at
ttit. But I'm beginning to think that
ttmaybe there's more to life than
ttmusic. I wonder if people would
ttstill like me if I stopped being
ttMr. Excitement?

<b>tINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY
</b>
tPeggy and Charlie stand by their open locker.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDoes this mean you like me again?

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttIt means I care about you and what
tthappens to you.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThat's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause
ttI'm never going to give up on us.
ttIt's easy to fall apart in a
ttcrisis. It's easy to be selfish and
ttsay goodbye and good luck. But this
ttis more than love. This is a mental
ttdecision. Just wait till tomorrow,
ttwhen you see your birthday present.
ttThen you'll understand.

tCharlie walks away as Peggy reaches into the locker for her
tbooks.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttPeggy, I have to talk to you.

tPeggy turns to Carol. They walk down the hallway together.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttWhat's the matter?

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttIt's that jerk Walter.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttWhat happened?

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttAfter Charlie told Walter that he
ttbroke up with you because he wanted
ttto play the field, Walter decided
tthe should do the same thing.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttWelcome to the singles' scene.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttWhat a I going to do for the rest
ttof my life? I don't have a
ttboyfriend anymore.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttLook, Carol, maybe Walter's done
ttyou a big favor. You always said
ttyou wanted to get out of town. Go
ttfor it. And be happy, goddamnit,
ttI'm rooting for you.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tWalter walks up to Charlie.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHey Charlie, what do you think of
ttthis?

tWalter does a totally demented dance step, finishing by
tstrumming his leg like a guitar. He stands there grinning.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWalter, maybe you should be a
ttdentist.

<b>tINT. CLASSROOM
</b>
tPeggy sits at her desk, organizing her books. We hear the end
tof the ANNOUNCEMENTS over the P.A. SYSTEM.

<b>ttttMR. MOSEY (V.0.)
</b>ttAnd finally, our heartiest
ttcongratulations to our girls diving
ttteam for placing second in the
ttcounty finals last Friday. And a
ttspecial accolade to Rosalie Testa
ttwho placed first in every one of
tther events. We're proud of you,
ttRosalie.

tEverybody turns toward Rosalie and applauds. Peggy turns to
tRosalie, trembling. The BELL RINGS as the class starts to
tleave, still crowded around Rosalie. Peggy stares after her,
tfrozen in her seat Dolores approaches.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttWhat's the matter, princess? Lost
ttyour prince?

tPeggy looks up at Dolores and starts to seethe. She stands up
tslowly and faces Dolores.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttYou know Dolores, there's a lot of
ttthings I could say to you, but
ttyou're not worth the effort.

tPeggy reaches down totup her books. On the top of the pile is
tan open fountain pen, which she picks up, pul1ing the release
tlever, squirting ink all over Dolores's dress. Dolores drops
ther books, looks down at her dress, horrified.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttSorry. These fountain pens are so
tttricky.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttt(screams)
ttOh! You did that on purpose! I hate
ttyou. Go gargle with razor blades!

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI beg your pardon?

</b>ttTake a long walk on a short pier.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttHave a nice day.

<b>tINT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM
</b>
tPeggy sits disconsolate on a bench, watching the other girls
tchanging into their swim suits. Rosalie is in the shower
troom, wetting down her suit. She accepts congratulations from
ta number of the girls. The BELL RINGS as the girls begin to
texit to the pool.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttRosalie! Wait!

tRosalie turns at the door, smiling. They are alone.

<b>ttttROSALIE
</b>ttWhat's up?

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI think you should give up diving.
ttIt's dangerous.

<b>ttttROSALIE
</b>ttDon't be silly, I'm the best in
ttthe county.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI know you are, but you have to
ttstop. I couldn't tell you before,
ttI didn't know if I should. But you
tthave to stop before you hurt
ttyourself.

<b>ttttROSALIE
</b>ttI spend three hours a day
ttpracticing. I have trainers, I know
ttwhat I'm doing.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttBut accidents can happen.

<b>ttttROSALIE
</b>ttNot to me they don't. I'm going to
ttwin the State, then the. Nationals,
ttand then I'm going to the Olympics.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttRosalie, please, listen to me! You
tthave to stop.

<b>ttttROSALIE
</b>ttYou're sick. You should go to the
ttnurse. I'm going to tell Miss
ttDennis.

tRosalie exits into the pool area. Peggy feels helpless.

<b>tINT. HALLWAY
</b>
tPeggy walks down the hall, a set of double doors, leading to
tthe pool, just ahead of her through them she sees Rosalie
tdiving through the air with the careless innocence of youth.

tBurdened with the inevitability of it all, she rushes through
tthe hall, and is stopped by Richard.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttWhat's the matter?

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttIt's all, gone wrong, nothing's
ttworking out.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttNot true.  I think I'm making real
ttprogress on the microchip.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttYou were meant to. You're one of
ttthose fortunate people that good
ttthings happen to. I have to get out
ttof here.

tShe starts to walk away.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttPeggy, I believe you. I believe
tteverything you told me. It's
ttwonderful. You're the exception
ttthat proves the rule.

tShe kisses him on the forehead.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI love you too, Richard. Thanks for
tttrying.

tShe continues down the hallway.

<b>tEXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
tPeggy heads out the door, sees Charlie.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHey, Peggy. Wait a minute.

tPeggy stops on the landing. Charlie joins her, so eager. He
tdoesn't notice how distraught she is.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI cut shop and did some work on
ttyour song. You know, it's not half
ttbad for your first try. Of course,
ttI changed all the "yeahs" to
tt"oohs". Listen to this.

tCharlie begins to sing an R&B version of SHE LOVES YOU.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttForget it, it'll never work.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOkay. Listen, I cancelled the
tttickets for Fabian. I thought it
ttwould be better for your birthday
ttto eat at a nice restaurant, Chez

tWalter, Arthur, Maddy and Carol watch as Peggy runs away.

tPeggy sees her grandparents waiting for her.  She grips the
twindow rail tightly, trying to hold herself together.

<b>ttttBUS DRIVER
</b>ttEverybody gettin' off at Dumont.
ttHere we are.

tPeggy stands and reaches above to take down her suitcase.
tNervous, she drops it. A MAN, getting off the bus, helps her,
tpicking it up.

</b>ttThank you.

</b>ttNo trouble at all. 

tThe man gets off the bus.

</b>ttHello, Lilla!

</b>ttPeggy Sue!

tPeggy slowly walks down the steps, moved to tears. She
tapproaches her grandparents and drops her suitcases. She hugs
tthem tightly. The bus door closes and the bus pulls away
tbehind them.

tBarney is behind the wheel of a 1951 Plymouth. Elizabeth is

<b>ttttBARNEY
</b>ttQuite a bit more rain than usual
ttthis year. I hope it doesn't spoil
ttthe rhubarb.

</b>
tA fire blazes in the fireplace. A grandfather clock stands
tprominently in the room. The clock from Peggy's house.
tPeggy sits with Elizabeth, learning how to knit. Barney
tlaughs at "The Burns and Allen Show" on TV.

tSuddenly, Peggy places her hand over her heart and shivers
twith fear.

<b>ttttBARNEY
</b>ttWhat's the matter, Lilla? Somebody

tPeggy shivers again and shakes her head.

<b>tINT. LODGE - NIGHT
</b>
tA onex97story, pitchx97roof building. The sign over the entrance
treads.: THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN. Underneath the sign is
ta logo of a spreading sunrise. Peggy and Barney pull up to
tthe front, exit the car and enter the building.

<b>tINT. LODGE x97 ANTEROOM

tThirty old men are congregating around the cloak room. Most
tare already dressed in long, purple robes with the sunrise

tPeggy nervously clings to Barney' s arm.

</b>ttWelcome, Peggy Sue. It's nice to

</b>ttThank you.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttt(nervous)
ttDo you have to wear that hat?

<b>ttttBARNEY
</b>ttIt wouldn't be a lodge without

</b>ttDon't you worry. I'll be watching

<b>tINT. LODGE x97 MAIN ROOM
</b>
tA large meeting hall. The room is draped, and brightly lit
twith fluorescent lights. At one end sits a large, goldx97
tpainted wood throne. On either side are large candle holders,
twith lit candles. A small table serves as an altar in front
tof the platform. On a footstool is a potted plane with an
tartificial bird perched on its top. The throne and altar look
tlike a set left over from a summer stock "Macbeth".

tPeggy and Barney enter. Several men lead Peggy away from
tBarney to the throne. One man places a go1den cape around her
tshoulders. They lead her up the platform to the throne.

<b>ttttHENRY
</b>ttHey, George. Get the lights.

tThe LIGHTS are DIMMED. The room is lit by the candles.

tThe men form a semix97circle around Peggy. Old men at the end
tof their lives, they are serious and passionate about the
tpossibilities of life beyond this world. One by one, four men
tfrom either end of the line approach the altar with
tofferings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose.
tThe men rejoin the line.

tLEO COOPER, a tall, whitex97haired man, takes two steps
tforward. The other men begin to sing a Gregorian chant.

<b>ttttLEO
</b>ttt(to Peggy)
ttAre you ready, dear?

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttYes, sir.

tLeo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttFasten your seat belts. Here we go.

<b>ttttLEO
</b>ttLord of the Universe, Vast and
ttMighty One. Ruler of Light, King

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttt(sotto)
ttThis is never going to work.

tThe old men form a circle in front of Peggy. They begin to
tcircumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads
tbowed. As Barney passes in front of Peggy, he winks at her.
tShe smiles back.

<b>ttttMEN
</b>ttFount of life, Chariot of the
ttSpirit, Womb of the Mother, reclaim
ttthy child of light.

tWe HEAR a clap of distant THUNDER. Peggy trembles. The
tartificial bird falls off the plant. Peggy is struck with
tamazement. She begins to glow, poised to take off. The men
tcontinue to chant while:

<b>ttttLEO (O.S.)
</b>ttThe name of your love is sacrifice.
ttWe offer up this girl, that her
ttsoul may find its home.

tSuddenly a door is opened, a gust of wind pours in and
textinguishes the candles, plunging the hall into darkness.

<b>ttttLEO (0.S.)
</b>ttNothing to worry about. Somebody
ttget the lights.

tThe LIGHTS are TURNED ON. All the men look to the throne.

tPeggy is gone. They are speechless for a couple of beats.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttt(chipper)
ttWell, the girl's gone. Let's play
ttsome poker.

tCLOSE ON BARNEY x97 He smiles, happy that she made it. George
tcrosses to the wall, reaches behind the drapes and presses a
tbutton. The wall slides open to reveal a fullyx97equipped card
troom. The men shuffle in.

<b>tEXT. BEHIND THE LODGE

tCharlie carries Peggy off towards his car, one hand covering
ther mouth. Peggy struggles. When they reach the car, he puts

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI'm not getting in that blue

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttLet me got! Where are you taking

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttRight here. Now sit down.

</b>ttLook. I wanna tell you. I forgive

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttYou betrayed me, Charlie. You were
ttnever there for me or the children.
ttAnd now you come and tell me,

ttI'm scared. If you knew what I knew
ttyou'd be scared shitless.

</b>ttYou're crazy! You're really out of

ttt(tears start)
ttI don't want to be bitter. I'm a

tand strokes her hair.

</b>ttOh, Peggy. My poor Peggy. It's all

</b>ttWill you take me back to my

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt's almost your birthday. I wasn't

<b>tEXT. ON THE HILL - LATER
</b>
tCharlie and Peggy are lying on the ground, gazing up. A flash
tof lightning streaks across the sky.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI think we should get out of here.
ttIt's going to rain.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttt(musing)
ttDo you think anybody in the Fifties
ttever made love on a bed?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat the hell is that?

tFlying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon
tkite. The center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing
tlike a marquee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEGGY SUE.

tThe kite begins to descend towards them. Peggy jumps to her
tfeet and races towards it. She grabs the tail and starts to
tsail away with the kite. Charlie chases after her.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttPeggy! Where're you going? Come
ttback!

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI've got to go now.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBut I love you. I'll love you
ttforever.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll
ttlove you for twenty years.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCome back to me.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttI'm trying.

tAs Charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning
tstrikes his car. Peggy smiles. The men from the lodge run
toutside. They look up and above the blazing car and see Peggy
tfloating away. Peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and
tblows him a kiss. Charlie begins to run, following the kite
tcord to its source. He finds Richard, struggling to restrain
tthe runaway kite.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttRichard, do something!

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttI can't! It's out of control!

tSuddenly the cord breaks. Peggy floats away.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttPeggy!

tCharlie, Richard and the old men behold Peggy, bobbing and
tdipping playfully in the sky. We begin to HEAR Charlie's
tVOICE singing "Peggy Sue" O.S. Peggy looks down with wonder
tat the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the
tblackness. In an instant she becomes a star.

<b>tFINAL SCENE
</b>
<b>tttttDISSOLVE/OPTICAL
</b>
<b>tHOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
tMoving from two to C.U. Peggy, fragments of the reunion, the
tcake coming towards her, fragments of words in echo effect:
t'Your heart stopped for a while..." Father's voice:
t'You're a very lucky young lady...' Doctor: 'A (explain) of
tthe head...' Mom's voice: 'But you're going to be all right
tnow, the paramedics got there...' Mom, 'We were so
tworried..."

tEchoing of, until once voice is left. Charlie. Sitting
topposite her bed, as he has been every minute of her illness.
tHe looks wan and old, worried sick, but trying to sing 'Peggy
tSue' for her.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt(singing softly).
ttPeggy Sue, I love you, and I need
ttyou Peggy Sue...

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttCharlie? Was I dead?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI thought you were...for a while.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttt(affectionately)
ttYou look awful, like you haven't
ttslept in days. And so old.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBut happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttCharlie, I thought I knew
tteverything about you.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI wanted to apologize. I can't live
ttwithout you.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttWhat about Janet?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThat's over. I got tired of
tttranslating everything. She thought
ttthe Big Hopper was a hamburger.

tCharlie laughs uncomfortably and Peggy Sue looks around her
thospital room.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttWho are all the flowers from?

tCharlie pushes himself out of his chair and moves toward the
tdresser.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttEveryone.  Maddie and Arthur, Carol
ttand Walter. Richard Norvick.  And
tthere's a book, by that guy from
tthigh school, Michael Fitzsimmons. 
ttHe dedicated it to you.

tCharlie returns to Peggy's bedside and opens the front cover
tof the book.

tANGLE ON BOOK: the front page bears the title "The Pilgrim
tSoul" and the dedication reads "<b>to Peggy Sue and a Starry
tNight</b>".

tPeggy smiles but shakes her head.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttIt couldn't be me.  I hardly knew
tthim.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll just set it right here.

tHe places the book on her bedside table as he sits back down.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttCharlie, I had a strange
ttexperience.  I went back to high
ttschool. And I spent a lot of time
ttwith you.  And you and Walter and
ttLeon were singing "I Wonder Why".

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOh, God, Dion.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttYou were terrific.  And I kept
tttrying to push you away but you
ttwouldn't give up.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll never give up.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttThen hold me.

tHe holds her hand.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI loved you since the day I met
ttyou, and I haven't stopped.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttDon't try to charm me, Charlie
ttBodell.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttListen, I don't expect all the
tttroubles between us can just vanish
ttaway. But I would do what I can...

<b>ttttPIGGY
</b>ttCharlie, please, I need some time.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, I'll let you get some
ttrest...so long.

tThe VIEW PULLS BACK past the flowers. Charlie starts to exit.
tChecks himself in the mirror.

<b>ttttPEGGY
</b>ttCharlie, I would like to invite you
ttto dinner at home, on Sunday, with
ttyour kids. I will make a strudel.

tHe hurries back to her, kisses her again.

tThey hang on to each other as Beth enters the room.
