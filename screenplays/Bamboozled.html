</b>
The tenement building is boarded up, condemned, bombed out,
but a home, a shelter nonetheless.

<b>INT. TENEMENT - MORNING
</b>
People to our surprise live in here.  It is a commune.  The
homeless, people who have been left out, forgot about,
written off, and don't matter.  The fringes of society.

CHEEBA, a skinny Puerto Rican male, tries to wake a
slumbering body under a mass of old newspapers.

</b>tttThat's right.  We slow.  We blow.

<b>INT. CNS TOWER - MORNING
</b>
MANRAY, a young African-American dread-lock male, and Cheeba
are getting set up in front of the entrance to the
CONTINENTAL NETWORK SYSTEM building.  CNS is one of the
fledgling, upstart new networks, trying to battle with ABC,
NBC, CBS, FOX, WB, and UPN.

<b>ANGLE ON
</b>
Entrance.  Cheeba is putting the portable floor down on the
sidewalk.  Manray sits on the curb, taking the sneakers off
and putting on his tap shoes; bottle caps are on the soles
of the shoes instead of real taps.

<b>ttttCHEEBA
</b>tttGood morning, ladies and gentlemen.
tttI know everybody is in a hurry to
tttwork, ready to begin another day in
tttthis rat race.  But don't sleep us.
tttI'm Cheeba and I introduce to you
tttthe world renown MANRAY, the man

stopped to look.

and holds it out in front of them.

<b>ttttCHEEBA (CONT'D)
</b>tttThank you very much but please

</b>tttI would like to add that both of us
tttare homeless.  Not that it means
tttanything.

A WOMAN is about to dump some change in the brown paper bag.

<b>ttttCHEEBA (CONT'D)
</b>tttI said homeless.  Ladies and
tttgentlemen.  Senorita, do you know
tttwhat that means?

Cheeba looks at her and she quickly pulls out a 5-spot from
her purse and drops it into the bag.

</b>tttMuchos gracias.

Cheeba works his way over to Delacroix.

</b>tttIt's not gonna be a good morning

</b>tttWhat staff meeting?

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>tttThe staff meeting that started 30
tttminutes ago.

<b>INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Delacroix walks, or better yet, slithers into the staff
meeting that is already in progress.  TWENTY WRITERS sit
around an oval table, all are Caucasian except Delacroix,
again he's the lone person of color, the "fly in the
buttermilk."

DUNWITTY, Senior V.P. of the Entertainment Division of CNS
looks at Delacroix and waits for him to sit down before he
continues.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI didn't find out about this very

Delacroix looks at his Jaeger-LeCoultre.

<b>ttttDELACROIX (CONT'D)
</b>tttFour minutes ago.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttSo are you telling me everyone knew
tttabout this get-together except you?

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI wasn't told about this until
tttMarie informed me as soon as I got

All eyes are on Delacroix and he feels it.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttPeople, you can attempt to pull a
tttRodman like our friend Delacroix,
tttbut I guarantee you'll be sent
tttpacking just like him.

Dunwitty via remote turns off the lights and turns on an
overhead projector.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY (CONT'D)
</b>tttThese are the standings.  Read 'em
tttand weep.  As you can plainly see
tttthe Continental Network System is

Dunwitty turns on the lights.  JOAN, one of the writers,
raises her hand.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY (CONT'D)
</b>tttQuestion?

<b>ttttJOAN
</b>tttSo what do you want us to do?

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttWhat I want everyone to do is write

</b>

<b>INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
</b>
The writers, beat down, come out of the conference room and
move past SLOAN HOPKINS, a highly attractive African-
American "sistuh."

Delacroix sees Sloan and holds her arm as they walk.  He
talks under his breath.

<b>ttttSLOAN
</b>tttHow was it?

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttWhy didn't you tell me about this

<b>ttttSLOAN

<b>ttttSLOAN
</b>tttIt wasn't my fault.  If I would

<b>INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
Delacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action
photos of ALI, JORDAN, GRIFFEY, TYSON, AARON and JABBAR on
his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout.

<b>ANGLE ON
</b>
Office.  Dunwitty looks at the floor-to-ceiling windows
overlooking mid-town Manhattan.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttDo you know what C.P. Time is?

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttC.P. Time is Colored People's Time.
tttThe stereotypical belief that
tttNegroes are always late.  That
tttNegroes have no sense of time -
ttttime except when it comes to music
tttor dance.

They both laugh.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttLet's sit down over there.

<b>tttttttttt9.
</b>

Dunwitty and Delacroix sit on the sofa.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY (CONT'D)
</b>tttI'm sorry about my blowup but I
ttthave to have a whipping boy every
tttmeeting.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI understand.  But again, in all
ttthonesty I was not informed.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttForget it.  I believe you're my
tttmost creative person I've got on
tttstaff.  You're hip.  You know
tttwhat's happening.  I got some corny
tttwhite boys and girls writing for me.

Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he
doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is
headed with it.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY (CONT'D)
</b>tttI understand Black culture.  I grew
tttup around black people all my life.
tttIf the truth be told I probably
tttknow "niggers" better than you,
tttMonsieur Delacroix.  Please don't
tttget offended by my use of the
tttquote-unquote N word.  I got a
tttblack wife and three bi-racial
tttchildren, so I feel I have a right
tttto use that word.  I don't give a
tttdamn what Spike says, Tarantino is
tttright.  Nigger is just a word.  If
tttDirty Ole Bastard can use it every
tttother word so can I.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI would prefer you not use that
tttword in my presence.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b><b>tttNIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
</b>
Delacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse
and gives him a quick BROOKLYN BEAT DOWN.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttSay it again.  C'mon, say it again.

<b>CLOSE ON
</b>

</b>

</b>
Delacroix.

He straightens his tie.

<b>ttttDELACROIX (CONT'D)
</b>tttWho's a nigger now?

POW.  This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind.  We go BACK TO
REALITY.  Everything's how we left it.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttThe material you've been creating
tttis too white bread.  White people
tttwith black faces.  The Huxtable's,
tttCosby, revolutionary.  But that's
tttdead.  We can't go down that road
tttagain.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI don't agree.  The Negro middle
tttclass does exist, and it's rich
tttmaterial for a dramatic series or
tttsitcom.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttI'm telling you it's not.

He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts
throwing them one by one against the window.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY (CONT'D)
</b>tttThe middle class black family moves
tttinto a white suburban enclave.  The
tttmiddle class black family moves
tttinto a small Southern town that is
tttrun by the KKK.  The middle class
tttsingle black father raises his
tttteenage daughter.  The middle class
tttsingle black father raises his
tttteenage daughter.  The middle class
tttsingle black mother raises her
tttteenage son.  And so on and so
tttforth.  It's too clean, too
tttantiseptic...

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>ttt...to white?  I still feel all of
tttmy scripts would make good shows.

<b>tttttttttt  11.
</b>

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttDelacroix, wake up, brother man.
tttThe reason why they didn't get
tttpicked up was because nobody - and
tttI mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers
tttalike wants to see that junk.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI've never been given a fair shot.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttYou got your head stuck up your ass

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I
tttdon't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM
<b>tttOUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF
</b>tttDESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as
tttyou might put it, some "nigger"
tttshow?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than
tttwhite and you're blacker than black?
tttIs that what you think?

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttThat's exactly what I think.  I
tttwant you to create something that
tttpeople want to see.  Let's be
ttthonest, the majority of the people
tttin the country are deaf, dumb and
tttblind and I'm including 35 million
tttAfrican-Americans.  You know and I
tttknow "niggers" set the trend, set
tttthe styles.  This is a golden

</b>tttYou will or you'll be back at BET

<b>ttttCHEEBA
</b>tttAre you crazy?  The joint is

Manray looks at his friend, he knows he is right, at least
this time.

</b>tttWhat point is that?

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttThe point being that him, the

She notices the vehicle and starts to walk faster.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI've done a lot of soul searching

tttmy previous work it's been all
tttsurface, superficial.  I have never
tttreally dug deep.  Not anymore.  As
tttMark Twain fully understood satire
tttis the way.  Race has always been a
ttthot button in this country's
ttthistory and it needs to be pushed
tttharder.  If we are ever to live
tttside by side in peace and harmony.
tttIt's about promoting racial healing.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttGo on.  Good so far.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI know you're familiar with minstrel
tttshows.  They came about at the turn
tttof the 19th century.  It was a
tttvariety show in which the talent
tttwas in blackface - singing, dancing,
ttttelling jokes, doing skits.
tttDunwitty, I ask you when was the
tttlast time there was a good variety
tttshow on the air.  Carol Burnett?
tttHeeHaw?

<b>tttttttttt  29.
</b>

<b>ttttDUNWITTY

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttSo let's take this great form, this

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttThe name of the show?

<b>ttttDELACROIX

<b>tttMILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
</b>
<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttI'm lovin' it.  You know how I know?
tttBecause I'm getting a boner, my

<b>ttttDUNWITTY (CONT'D)
</b>tttI'm feelin' dis'!

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttIt will take a lot of courage and

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttDon't worry about that, that's my

</b>tttEvery week we follow the trials and

</b>tttIgnorant, dullwitted, lazy, and

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttMantan is an uneducated Negro who

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttAnd Sleep 'n Eat is his comical

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttYep, you guessed it.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttThis could be bigger than "Amos and
tttAndy."

<b>tttttttttt  31.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttProtest finally forced "Amos and

</b>tttLet'em try.  I will kill to make

Delacroix looks at Sloan.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttNegroes would be in an uproar.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttSo what.  We would just give the

<b>ttttDUNWITTY

<b>ttttDELACROIX

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttYa first bad move.  Projects been

<b>ttttSLOAN

</b>tttAs long as the hoofing is real,

</b>tttRhythms, rhythms, rhythms.  Beats,
tttbeats, beats.  No Fred Astaire
ttthere, baby.  Just rawness.

Dunwitty clears his desk of everything, just knocks stuff
flying onto the floor.  And Mantan taking the cue, jumps up
on his desk and really starts hitting it.

<b>CLOSE ON
</b>
Delacroix, as he watches his creation, it's not a happy face.

<b>CLOSE ON
</b>
Mantan, he's bringing it home.  With the final move, he
leaps off the desk into the middle of the office, and FREEZES.

<b>ttttCHEEBA
</b>tttI play the straight man.  I do some

</b>tttI guess he's still on the road.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttTo answer your question, there are

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttNow I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because
tttI didn't grow up on food stamps and

tttthat living in poverty earns you

tttlied to you.

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttThe point I'm trying to make is
tttthat this is a blessing.  It's

Delacroix gets up from the table and leaves.

<b>ttttCHEEBA
</b>tttWhat's wrong with him?

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttMust be the pressure.

Cheeba and Mantan laugh, give each other some dap.  A highly
attractive PUERTO RICAN female walks over to their table.
This is JESSICA GRILLO.

<b>ttttJESSICA
</b>tttSorry I'm late.

Cheeba and Mantan are in awe.

</b>tttI propose a toast.

She grabs an empty glass and pours herself some champagne.

<b>ttttJESSICA (CONT'D)
</b>tttTo the success of your show.  Good

Everyone raises their glasses.  CLINK!

<b>ttttSLOAN
</b>tttExcuse me.

Sloan gets up from the table and takes after Delacroix.

Steps. Sloan catches up with Delacroix at the rest room area.

<b>ttttSLOAN (CONT'D)
</b>tttWait here.

<b>tttttttttt  43.
</b>

She goes to the ladies' cubicle.

Bathroom door.  Sloan comes out, grabs him inside.

Sloan locks the door.

</b>tttWhat is your problem?

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttMy problem is MANTAN THE NEW

</b>
<b>ttttSLOAN
</b>tttWhy did you even come up with that
tttshit if you didn't want it made?

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttIt was the principle.  Dunwitty had
tttto be enlightened.  I was making a
tttpoint.  I take pride in my work.
tttPlus, I already told you I wasn't
tttgonna walk away from my money.

<b>ttttSLOAN
</b>tttFuck da money.  Why do through all

tttfor love from Dunwitty?  For

tttnow what are you gonna do?

Someone begins to pound on the bathroom door.

<b>ttttWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

tttto use the toilet.

<b>ttttSLOAN
</b>tttYou're gonna have to hold it in

</b>

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttEven if money wasn't an issue,

<b>ttttSLOAN
</b>tttWhat's the chances of MANTAN being
tttpicked up?

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI wouldn't bet against it.  My
tttNegroidal ass is stuck between the
tttproverbial rock and a hard place.

<b>ttttSLOAN
</b>tttLike I said, all this for some
ttttwisted, distorted sense of
tttprincipal.  Dunwitty, he just
ttttolerates your Negroidal ass, he
tttdoesn't respect it.

The banging starts again.

<b>ttttMANAGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>tttPlease open this bathroom door

tttinconsiderate.

Sloan unlocks the door and they exit.

Ladies' bathroom.  Sloan and Delacroix file past the strange
looks of the manager and FIVE WOMEN waiting to use the
bathroom as they rush in.

<b>INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI strongly feel that a Negro should
tttdirect this.  This kind of satire
tttis a high wire act in a gale storm.
tttOne misstep and we're doing "Amos
tttand Andy."  Only a Negro will have
tttthe sensitivity and cultural
tttawareness to navigate this dangerous
tttterrain.

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttTo hire someone solely on their

tttwill hire someone who is most

<b>tttttttttt  45.
</b>

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI was hoping to perhaps direct some

</b>tttI want a hot, young white director.
tttMaybe the kid, that pheenom who

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttBesides, what does he know about
tttNegroes?

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttProbably nuthin', but that's why
tttit's such a sexy way to go.
tttSometimes an outsider has a fresh

tttpossibilities are endless.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttWhat are his qualifications besides
tttbeing a white male and directing a
ttthot new sexy freaky Madonna video?

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttIf Spielburg can direct "The Color
tttPurple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid
tttcan direct the Mantan pilot.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttThat's exactly my point.  Has he
ttteven directed actors before in
tttanything?

<b>ttttDUNWITTY
</b>tttNo!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's

WE SEE singers, magicians, dancers, acrobats, comedians,
rappers.  Some good, most are terrible.  Many come out on

<b>EXT. PARK - NIGHT
</b>
Mantan and Sloan are sitting on a park bench, nothing is
being said.  He sits up and starts to do a dance for her.
To her.

<b>ON BENCH
</b>
Mantan is doing that "Mating" tap dance.

<b>ttttSLOAN
</b>tttAre you trying to seduce me?

He puts his index finger over his mouth - "Quiet."

<b>ttttSLOAN (CONT'D)
</b>tttYou think that's gonna work, huh?

He quickly jumps up on the bench, does some intricate steps
then pulls Sloan up from her sitting position.

<b>ON MANTAN AND SLOAN
</b>
They kiss.

<b>tttttttttt  69.

<b>EXT. I-95 SOUTH - MORNING
</b>
Delacroix is driving "down south."

<b>INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Delacroix adjusts the mirror so he can see himself.  HE
SPEAKS TO US through the MIRROR

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI figured this was a good time to
tttget away.  Just jump in my ride and
tttgo.  I always did my best thinking
tttwhen I was driving alone.  I needed
tttto think out clearly what I was
tttgoing to do with this MANTAN - THE
<b>tttNEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
</b>
<b>EXT. I-95 SOUTH
</b>
Delacroix is driving on his way to "Ole Virginny."

<b>EXT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK - NIGHT
</b>
Delacroix pulls up in the parking lot of a rinky-kink,
funky, greasy BAR/CLUB/BAR-B-Q joint.

<b>CLOSE ON NEON SIGN
</b>
"MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK" - most the letters do not light up,
underneath it, "2-NITE - JUNEBUG."

<b>INT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK
</b>
It's loud as hell as Delacroix enters this smoky, dark
establishment.

<b>P.O.V. DELACROIX
</b>
This must be a big night in here because the PATRONS are
dressed to the nines.  What's in style down here is a lot
different from what's happening en Nueva York.  Many of the
men are dressed like PIMPS from 70's BLAXPLOITATION FILM,
the ladies like HOOTCHIE MAMAS from "Luke" video.

<b>ON SUGAR SHAK
</b>
Delacroix works himself through the crowded BAR/DISCO into
another small room.

<b>ON COMEDY ROOM
</b>
He walks into a small space where his father JUNEBUG is on
the stage.

<b>tttttttttt  70.
</b>

<b>ON JUNEBUG
</b>
He is a good-looking man, the only speckle of gray in his
hair betrays his age.  As he walks around the small stage
doing his comedy stylings, he keeps a drink in one hand and
sips it often.

<b>ON COMEDY ROOM
</b>
Delacroix sits in the back so his father can't see him.

<b>ON DELACROIX
</b>
He looks around.

<b>P.O.V. DELACROIX
</b>
It's dead in here.  The room is nearly empty.

<b>ON TABLE
</b>
A couple gets loud, arguing over something.

<b>ON JUNEBUG
</b>
<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>ttt'Cuse me.  Please.  Can you please
tttshow me some respect.  I'm up here
ttttrying to make a living.

</b>tttMind yo' business.

</b>tttDon't make me have to come over

The sparse AUDIENCE laughs.

<b>ttttJUNEBUG (CONT'D)
</b>tttJust messin' with ya.  But please
tttif you and your lady need to
tttdiscuss something, take it outside.
tttThank you.

He continues on with his show.

<b>ON TABLE
</b>
Delacroix walks over to the fighting couple.

<b>tttttttttt  71.
</b>

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttBrother man, that's my father up
tttthere and I drove a long way to see
ttthim perform.  Please take this
tttfifty, go buy you and the young

The guy looks him up and down.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>tttThat's yo' Daddy?

Delacroix nods.

<b>ttttMAN (CONT'D)
</b>tttDon't need yo money for drinks.
tttBesides, she's drunk already.
tttC'mon, let's go.

The guy grabs his friend by the wrist and drags her kicking
and screaming out the room.

<b>CLOSE ON JUNEBUG
</b>
<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttDon't bring your woman out if you
tttcan't keep her in deep check.  If
tttmy woman ever did something crazy
tttlike that I'd put my size 12 dead
tttup in her ass.

This gets the biggest laugh of the night.

<b>EXT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Delacroix knocks.

<b>ttttJUNEBUG (O.S.)
</b>tttWhat do you want?

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI want to speak with you.

<b>ttttJUNEBUG (O.S.)
</b>tttGo away, unless you got my money.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttIt's me, Peerless.

<b>INT. DRESSING ROOM
</b>
He enters into a closet, it's a makeshift dressing room.  A
younger lady, much younger than Junebug - DOT - stands
behind him as she massages his neck.

<b>tttttttttt  72.
</b>

Junebug gets up from his chair, rushes to his son and they
embrace.

<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttSon.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttIt's been a long time.

</b>tttPull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me,

<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttHoney, pour me and my son a drink.

They both sit down as drinks are poured.

<b>ttttDOT
</b>tttI'll leave you two alone.

She kisses Junebug on the forehead before leaving.

<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttGood woman.  I trained her right.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttDaddy, she's younger than me.

<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttMy game is still strong.  No Viagra
tttfor me, don't need no chemicals.
tttJust my tonic.

He holds up his drink and kills it in one gulp.

<b>ttttJUNEBUG (CONT'D)
</b>tttPurely for medicinal purposes.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI thought you had promised Mommy
tttyou stopped.

<b>tttttttttt  73.
</b>

<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttI did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I
tttjust like to drink.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttHow did you end up here?

<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttHow did I end up at the third rate
tttchittlin' circuit greasy hole in
tttthe wall in West Hell, Virginny?
tttIs that what you're asking ya Daddy?

Delacroix takes a sip of his drink.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttThat's what I'm askin'.

<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttBecause I had too much pride.  Too
tttmuch integrity.  I wouldn't lick
tttnobody's butt.  Some material I
tttrefused to do.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttDaddy, it can't be just because of
tttthat.  There had to be other factors.

Junebug pours himself another stiff one.

<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttThat's the only reason, period.
tttThey only want one certain kind of
tttblack comic.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttAnother one of your conspiracies to
ttthold ya career back?

<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttAll I know is what happened to me.
tttAll that other mess I just file
tttinto the "life's too short" category.

He downs another one.  Junebug drinks like a fish.

<b>ttttJUNEBUG (CONT'D)
</b>tttEnough about me, what's happening
tttwith you?

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttThe same old, same old.  Trying to

</b>tttWhere do you go from here?

<b>ttttJUNEBUG
</b>tttThree nights Charleston, South
tttCarolina.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttI didn't mean that, in life.

<b>INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Delacroix and Dot are on either side of Junebug as they hold
him up.

<b>ON DOOR
</b>
Delacroix struggles to put the key in the door.

The door is kicked open as the trio comes in.  Junebug is
drunk as a skunk.

They lay him down on the bed.

Dot takes off his shoes.  He's out like a light.  Gone.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttHow long has my father been like
tttthis?

<b>ttttDOT
</b>tttNot that often.  He was excited to
tttsee you.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttSo he drank himself into a stuper?

<b>ttttDOT
</b>tttThe drinking is for the pain.  It
tttdoesn't kill it, just dulls it.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttSo what's up with you?

<b>ttttDOT
</b>tttI was a hostess at this club, your
tttDaddy was performing and I had
tttnever laughed so hard in my life.
tttHe asked me to come with him.  I
tttquit my job and we've been together

Delacroix pulls out his billfold and gives Dot five crisp
new model hundred dollar bills.

</b>tttDon't tell him it's from me or he
tttwon't take it.

<b>CLOSE ON DELACROIX
</b>
<b>ttttDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>tttMantan was being hailed as
tttgroundbreaking, barrier breaking,
tttalso earth shaking.  I looked
tttforward to my awards.  Just

</b>tttThe winner is... Pierre Delacroix
tttfor Mantan - The New Millennium
tttMinstrel Show!

Delacroix jumps out og his chair and starts sobbing.  Two
ushers have to help him to the stage.  He is overcome with
emotion.  The audience is on their feet with a standing
ovation.  He hugs Alec Baldwin.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttAlec Baldwin, this is the very
tttfirst time we've ever met, you
tttdon't know this, I'm your biggest
tttfan and I want you to have my Emmy.
tttIt's for you, out of the deep
tttbowels of my heart - I don't
tttdeserve this.  You take it.

Alec Baldwin is shocked.  He grabs Delacroix in a bear hug
and they both cry like babies.

<b>ttttDELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>tttIf I did that I'd be assured to
tttwork forever.  Delacroix the

<b>ttttWOODY HARRELSON (CONT'D)
</b>ttt...Pierre Delacroix for Mantan.
tttCome on up and get your Golden Globe.

Delacroix jumps out of his seat and sprints.  He gets down
on the stage and starts to breakdance, even spinning on his
head.

<b>ttttDELACROIX (V.O.)
</b>tttThat routine would go over like

tttfool, Hollywood's new favorite

Mantan is running rigorous rehearsal of The Pikaninnies.
Over and over, repetition after repetition, Snowflake,
Rastus, Sambo, Nigger Jim, Jungle Bunny and Aunt Jemima try
to do an intricate dance step.

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttI'm tired of you pickaninnies

</b>tttBetter.

Cheeba walks in.  Mantan checks him out.

<b>ttttMANTAN (CONT'D)
</b>tttLet's take a ten minute break.

It's an unruly, fired up crowd that can be heard all the way

</b>tttYou're sure this is a good idea.

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttMy people love me.

He kisses her, she doesn't resist.

<b>ttttSLOAN

After a long, deep kiss she gently pulls back.

<b>ttttSLOAN (CONT'D)
</b>tttI'll be down front.  You better

</b>tttY'know what?

</b>
Sloan takes a seat down front.

<b>tttttttttt 106.
</b>

<b>INT. DRESSING ROOM
</b>
Mantan, face already done, puts on the firetruck red lipstick.

<b>INT. APOLLO THEATRE
</b>
Sloan is looking around this boisterous crowd when she sees

<b>ON THE MAU-MAU'S
</b>
In one of the side boxes.

<b>ON BIG BLACK
</b>
He waves to his sister.

<b>ON SLOAN
</b>
She knows her brother and his clan are up to no good as the
house lights go black.

<b>ANGLE ON STAGE
</b>
Honeycutt walks out on stage.  The audience goes crazy.

<b>ttttHONEYCUTT
</b>tttThank you so very much.  Show me
tttsome love.

He laughs.

<b>ttttHONEYCUTT (CONT'D)
</b>tttThank you.  My name is Honeycutt
tttand I want to welcome you to a very
tttspecial evening.  It's always great
tttcoming back to the World Famous

The audience applauds.

<b>ttttHONEYCUTT (CONT'D)
</b>tttAs everybody knows if you can make
tttit here on this stage in front of
tttthe most discriminating audience in
tttthe world you can make it anywhere.
tttLadies and gentlemen, let's show
tttsome real Uptown love for Mantan
tttThe Marvelous!

The curtain goes up and Mantan the Marvelous stands there,
arms raised.  He starts to do his thing.

<b>tttttttttt 107.
</b>

<b>ON MAU-MAU BOX
</b>
Led by Big Black, they start shouting insults at Mantan.

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
Mantan is a pro, he doesn't stop.  In fact, this makes him
dance harder and harder.

<b>ON SLOAN
</b>
She leaves her seat and goes to stop her brother.

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
Mantan is moving and grooving.  The unrest in the audience
has picked up.

<b>ON AUDIENCE
</b>
They start to "boo."  The tide has turned.  Encouraged, the
Mau-Mau's pick it up another notch.

<b>ON MANTAN
</b>
He's human after all, and he does hear the boos.  Don't let
those athletes in the papers fool you.  You hear the boos
and nobody, nobody except Dennis Rodman likes to be booed.
Mantan is getting rattled.

<b>ON MAU-MAU'S BOX
</b>
Sloan rushes into the box and they are quiet.  They don't
have to say or shout a thing.  The rough Apollo crowd is
doing it all themselves.

<b>TWO SHOT ON SLOAN AND BIG BLACK
</b>
The sister and big brother look at each other.  There is no
love between them.

<b>ttttSLOAN
</b>tttThis doesn't change a thing.  I
tttwill still love him.

Big Black can't believe what he has just heard.

<b>ON STAGE
</b>
Now projectiles are raining down upon Mantan.  This has
turned into a RUCKUS, a BROUHAHA, a DONNYBROOK.  Honeycutt
races onto the stage to pull off the still tap dancing
Mantan as the Harlem natives BUMRUSH the stage.  THE WORM
<b>HAS TURNED.
</b>
<b>tttttttttt 108.
</b>

<b>ON MAU-MAU'S BOX
</b>
Mantan, led by Honeycutt, runs for his life.

<b>ON MOB
</b>
They chase him.

<b>ON BACKSTAGE DOOR
</b>
Mantan is hauling ass.

<b>EXT. BACKSTAGE
</b>
The door crashes open, Mantan rockets out into an open car
door.

<b>ON CAR DOOR
</b>
The door slams.

<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
The car spins away.

<b>INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Delacroix is behind the wheel.  This is the most shaken
we've seen Mantan to date.

<b>ttttDELACROIX
</b>tttPull ya self together.

Mantan is distraught.

<b>ttttDELACROIX (CONT'D)
</b>tttWhat are you?  A man or a mouse?
tttAre you a punk?  Punking out on me?

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttNo.

Mantan is on the BET show with host TAVIS SMILEY.

<b>ttttTAVIS SMILEY
</b>tttOur guest tonight is the

tttMantan.  Thanks for coming in.

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttTavis, thank you for having me.

<b>ttttTAVIS SMILEY
</b>tttBefore we begin, I want to thank

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttI'm more comfortable around my
tttpeople.

<b>ttttTAVIS SMILEY
</b>tttLet's jump right into it.  Your
tttshow has sparked a world of
tttcontroversy, provoked a tone of
tttdialogue.  How do you see all of
tttthis?

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttYo, Tavis, check it out.  This is
tttthe two-one, the 21st century and
tttit's all about the money.  Like my

tttBenjamins."

<b>tttttttttt 110.
</b>

<b>ttttTAVIS SMILEY
</b>tttMoney and nothing else?

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttMoney makes the world go round.  It
tttain't no joke being poor.  I know
tttwhatI'mtalkin''bout.
tttY'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on
tttthe street.  I've been homeless.
tttI've learned how to play the game,
tttwork the game, be in the game.

<b>ttttTAVIS SMILEY
</b>tttIs it inevitable that the game
tttplays you?

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttNo if you go with the flow, Tavis.
tttThat's what a lot of Negroes don't
tttunderstand.  Protesting isn't gonna
tttdo a damn thing.  If people don't
tttlike our satire in our number one
ttthit show then don't watch it.  Or
tttbetter yet write your own show.  Do
tttit better.

<b>ttttTAVIS SMILEY
</b>tttDon't you feel that is a simplistic
tttretort?

<b>ttttMANTAN
</b>tttI don't know what a retort is, but
tttit's simple.  Mantan - The New
tttMillennium Minstrel Show is
tttUNIVERSAL.  It's not just for
