<b>tEXT. MCCALL HOUSE - LATE MORNING
</b>
tAn upper middle-class neighborhood, known as the Black
tBeverly Hills.  Big houses, green grass and Caddies in every
tother driveway.  The street is quiet, until --

<b>ttttYOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttYou wanna be Kareem?

tCAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a
tbasketball in front of KELVIN and JAMAL, also eleven.  He
tsports a fro, a "Clippers" jersey, and a serious swagger.

<b>ttttQUINCY (CONT'D)
</b>ttAll his big butt do is stand by the
ttbasket.

<b>ttttJAMAL
</b>ttShoot, I'll be blocking your stuff.

<b>ttttKELVIN
</b>ttI'm gonna be like Dr. J.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttI'ma be like my Dad.

<b>ttttJAMAL
</b>ttHe ain't a star or nothing.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttI don't see none of your sorry daddies in
ttthe NBA.

<b>ttttKELVIN
</b>ttHey, look, Q.

tQuincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse
tAll-Stars approaching from next door.  Walking in the kicks
tis a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap
tpulled low.  A moving van is parked in the driveway.

ttttKELVIN (cont'd)
ttThought only girls were moving in.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttThat's what my Moms said.

<b>ttttKELVIN
</b>ttI hope he can ball.

<b>ttttJAMAL
</b>ttBet he's a scrub.

tThe Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway.

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttHey.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttHey.

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttCan I play?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttYou nice?

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttYeah, I'm nice.

tQuincy looks the Kid up and down, then --

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttYou and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.

tQuincy tosses the Kid the ball.  The Kid pulls off the
tbaseball cap.  Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown
tface and bright eyes.  She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years
told.

<b>ttttJAMAL
</b>ttAh man, he is a girl.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttGirls can't play no ball.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttBall better than you.

tQuincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the
tdriveway.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttWhat a dog.

tMonica shoots him a glare.

<b>ttttJAMAL
</b>ttShe heard you.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttNuh uh, they could only hear dog
ttwhistles.

tMonica starts to dribble.  Jamal whistles as he walks
tbackwards, guarding her.  She throws up a shot.  IT'S AN
tAIRBALL.  Quincy and Jamal crack up.  Kelvin rolls his eyes.

tQuincy grabs the rebound and shoots.  Swish.

ttttQUINCY (cont'd)
ttOne, zip.

tHe rolls the ball to Monica.  She starts dribbling and again,
tJamal just backs up with her.  She passes to Kelvin.  Jamal
tand Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the
tbasket.  Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back.

tMonica catches the ball and throws up a shot.  It banks off
tthe backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET.  The boys look at
ther in shock.  Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttOne, up.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttLucky.

tQuincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball.  He
tthrows the ball back to Monica.

ttttQUINCY (cont'd)
ttTwo, one.

tMonica dribbles.  Jamal plays her a little tighter.  Monica
tbounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttTwo, up.

tQuincy can't believe it.  Kelvin cracks up.

<b>ttttKELVIN
</b>ttAaah, she dogged you.

<b>ttttJAMAL
</b>ttShut up.

tThe game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets
tfor their teams.  Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is
tunable to stop her.  The score hits nine, nine.

tQuincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttPoint.

tQuincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot.
tThe ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off.

tQuincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the
tball.  Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off.

ttttQUINCY (cont'd)
ttI got her.

tQuincy defends.  Monica smiles back at him.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttTold you I was nice.  I'm going to be
ttthe first girl in the NBA.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttI'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my
ttcheerleader.

tMonica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket.
tQuincy stumbles, giving her a step.  Kelvin throws it back.

tQuincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up.
tIn desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving
ther off balance.

<b>tTHE BALL FLIES FROM HER HAND AS SHE CRASHES TO THE GROUND,
</b><b>tFACE-FIRST.  SHE GRABS HER CHEEK.  BLOOD SLIPS THROUGH HER
</b><b>tFINGERS.
</b>
tThe boys stand frozen.  Quincy stares down at her, his eyes
twide with fear...and regret.

<b>tINT. WRIGHT HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATE MORNING
</b>
tMonica leans over the sink as her mother, CAMILLE, 36, wipes
tthe blood from her face with a washcloth.

<b>ttttGIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttEeew.

tHer sister, LENA, 14, leans in the doorway, making a face.
tShe is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and
tpainted nails.

tHer father, NATHAN, 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttHow are you feeling, munchkin?

tMonica nods.  He smiles.

ttttNATHAN (cont'd)
ttYeah, you're through.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttShe needs to stop running around like a
ttlittle boy.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttShe's alright.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttHow is she alright looking the way she
ttdoes?

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttCamille, she'll be fine.

tHe gives Monica a wink, crosses away.  Monica pulls the
twashcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood
therself.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttI'll get some ice.

tShe exits.  Lena shakes her head, follows.

tMonica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the
tmirror.  TORN SKIN SURROUNDS A SMALL DEEP GASH IN HER CHEEK.
tSeeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left
tfor this little girl to do.  She smiles.

<b>tINT. MCCALL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
tQuincy sits at the kitchen table, writing "I AM SORRY" in
tblock letters across a homemade card.  His face is tight with
tconcentration as he tries to write in a straight line.

tAt the counter, his mom, NONA, moves a cake from its store
tbox to a cake dish.  She is 30, beautiful, with effort.  She
tsmooths the frosting with a spoon.

tZEKE, 32, with the height and ego of an NBA ballplayer,
tenters.  He laughs.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttGirl, who you trying to fool?

tQuincy looks up, smiles.  He quickly grabs a piece of
tcrumpled paper, and tosses it to Zeke.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttAlley-oop, Dad.

tNona intercepts his pass.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttBoy...

tShe points him back to his card.  Quincy scowls, starts
twriting again.  Nona scoops some frosting on her finger,
tholds it up.

ttttNONA (cont'd)
ttNew neighbors.

tZeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting
toff.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttSee, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught
ttme, with the old fake and bake.  Had me
ttthinking I was getting a sister who could
ttburn.

tNona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss.  Quincy suddenly
tthrows down his pencil in frustration.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttI can't do this shit.

tZeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttBoy, what'd I tell you about using that
ttword?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttt(sighs, then)
tt"Can't" should never be in a man's
ttvocabulary.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttWhy not?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttCause when you say can't, you ain't a
ttman.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttThat's right.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttZeke.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttWhat?
ttt(then)
ttOh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

tNona just shakes her head.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttWe should head over.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttJust you and Quincy, baby.  I got a
ttmeeting.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttWith who?

</b>ttBusiness folks.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttYou just got back from a four game road
tttrip.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttNona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe
tttwo years left to play.  I'm just trying
ttto put some things together for us.

tZeke grabs his keys.

ttttZEKE (cont'd)
ttLater, Quincy.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttLater, Dad.

tZeke exits.  Nona leans against the counter, concerned.

ttttQUINCY (cont'd)
ttMom?

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttWe still have to go?

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttt(beat)
ttYeah.

<b>t  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>


tCamille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes.  Monica and
tQuincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at
teach other.  A large bandage covers Monica's cheek.  Monica
tholds her card, Camille holds the cake.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>tt...we moved back here when Quincy was
ttabout five, after Zeke was traded.
ttNeighborhood was a little more mixed
ttback then...

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttUntil the Black family down the street
ttbecame the Black family next door.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttt(nods)
ttOkay?

tCamille tries to smooth down Monica's unruly hair.  Monica
tmoves her head.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttWell, thanks again.  This was really nice
ttof you.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttIt was the least we could do.  And I love
ttto cook.

tQuincy looks up at his Mom, surprised.  She quickly hugs his
tface into her stomach.  Camille lights up.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttOh, me too.  I used to cook for my
ttfriends' parties and things back in
ttAtlanta.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttYou're a caterer?

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttWell, no, but once Nathan gets settled
ttand the girls get a little older, it's
ttdefinitely something I want to do.
ttt(then)
ttSince you love to cook, maybe it's
ttsomething we can talk about.

tQuincy snickers.  Nona quickly changes the subject.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttYou know, girl, long as I've lived next
ttdoor, I've never seen the inside of this
tthouse.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttReally?  Well, come on, then.

tCamille hands Monica the cake.

ttttCAMILLE (cont'd)
ttHoney, put this in the kitchen.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttHelp her, Quincy.

tCamille and Nona head down the hall, leaving Monica and
tQuincy alone.  The two just stand there.

tQuincy reaches out, scoops a finger of frosting, and pops it
tin his mouth.  Beat, then Monica takes a bigger scoop.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttSo...does it hurt?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttIt's this big hole.  You could almost see
ttbone.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttFor real?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttUh huh.

tQuincy is impressed.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttSo how come you could play basketball?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttI just can.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttI never knew a girl that could play.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttMy Mom says she doesn't know where I come
ttfrom 'cause I act different.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttYour Dad play?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttHe works at a bank.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttMy Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says
ttI'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma
ttplay for them, too.  Same number and
tteverything.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttI'm going to be number thirty-two, like
ttMagic.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttHe's alright, but my Dad can take him.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttWhat was the most points your Daddy ever
ttgot in Junior High?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttI don't know.  A lot.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttOne time Magic scored forty-eight points,
ttand they only had six minute quarters and
tthe sat out the whole fourth.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttYou do act different.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttI don't care.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttWell, if anybody bothers you, you could
ttjust tell me cause I run this street.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttI'd just tell my sister, Lena.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttShe don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad
ttshowed me how to fight like Ali.

tHe shows off a flurry of punches.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttSo, I know karate from "Almighty Isis."

tMonica puts the cake down on a box, does a couple of kicks
tand hand movements.  Quincy is impressed.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttBet you can't do this though.

tQuincy does a jump kick.  Monica does the same.

ttttQUINCY (cont'd)
ttOkay, how bout this?

tQuincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel.  It
tlooks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake.
tThe cake falls onto his head and shoulder.

tMonica doubles over, laughing.  Quincy is embarrassed.
tCamille and Nona rush back into the living room.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttMonica, what did you do?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttNothing.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttt(to Nona)
ttOh, all that work.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttIt's...it's okay.  Can I get a towel?

tCamille quickly crosses into the kitchen.  Quincy stares at
tthe floor.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttSorry.

tNona bends down, whispers in his ear.

<b>ttttNONA
</b>ttNo.  Good boy.

<b>tINT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT

tMonica sits between Lena's legs, grimacing, as Lena works a
tcomb through her freshly washed, kinky hair.  Monica's head
tflops like a rag doll.  Her eyes are wet.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttOw!

tLena keeps tugging.

ttttMONICA (cont'd)
ttOw, Lena!!!

tMonica punches her in the leg.

<b>ttttLENA
</b>ttOw!

tLena yanks Monica's head back as Camille enters, carrying a
tyellow dress on a hanger.  Monica sees it and her face falls.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttAh, Mom.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttI'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your

tlaugh.

ttttCAMILLE (cont'd)
ttChild, pick up your lip.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttI hate it.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttFine, you don't like this one, which one

tCamille rubs her temples, then hangs the dress on the door.

ttWhen you're done can you make sure she

<b>ttttLENA
</b>ttAre you okay?

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttI just need to lay down.  I've been

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttWhich one for tomorrow?

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttThe blue.

<b>ttttNATHAN

ttCan you iron both tonight just in case?

ttOkay.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttThanks, sweetheart.

</b>ttThe boy next door is riding with you to

tQuincy lays tucked in bed, eyes wide open, listening to his
tparents MAKING LOVE.  The sounds bring a smile to his face.

tQuincy climbs out of bed, wearing underwear.  He moves to his
twindow, sees Monica through her window directly across from
this.  Her eyes are closed as Lena braids her hair.  Quincy
tkneels down, rests his arms on the window sill, and watches.

tMonica emerges, walking her banana-seater.  She is looking
tcute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons.  A
tbasketball sits in her back basket.

tQuincy is taken aback, stares at her.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttYou wanna be my girl?

tMonica blinks in surprise.  She thinks for a moment.

</b>ttWhat do I have to do?

</b>ttI guess, you know, we play ball and we

tQuincy counts to five with his fingers.  They pull away,

ttwill you respond?  Well, your answer
ttbetter be hard work and sacrifice because
ttthat's the only way you're gonna make it
ttthrough.  Vince Lombardi preached it and
ttI teach it, "There is only one way to
ttsucceed at anything and that is to give

tMonica is clearly an outsider.

tThey move into position.  The ball is tossed up.  Italy winds
tthe tip and the ball is passed to Sidra.

tMonica hounds her as she brings up the ball.  Sidra shoves
ther off and to the floor, and scores.  No whistle.  Women's
tpro ball is at a whole other level.  Bigger, better, tougher.

tThe ball is passed in to Monica.  She drives down court, goes
tup for a lay up.  An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air,
ttaking out her legs.  Monica crashes on the hardwood.

tA whistle.  Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes
therself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word.
tWithout emotion.

</b>ttCan you take that damn thing off the

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttYou mean my championship trophy?  My bad.

tMonica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm

tMonica laughs.  She downs her drink, motions to the waiter.

</b>ttUno mas, por favor.

tThe waiter nods.

ttttMONICA (cont'd)
ttLast I heard, you were playing in Sweden.

<b>ttttSIDRA
</b>ttYeah, four years ago.  They had me
ttstaying in this tiny-ass town with like
ttfifty people.  I'm not playing, there was
ttabout a thousand goats running around,
ttand it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then
ttthe whack club I'm on loses three games
ttin a row and I get blamed.  So they fire
ttme.

</b>ttYup.  So I've been playing with this
ttItalian club the last three years.

</b>ttIt's better.  Even though the whole first

ttcause they were mad "The American" was
ttmaking more money.

ttI led the team in rebounds cause it was
ttthe only way I could touch the damn ball.

tMonica laughs as the waiter brings her drink.  She tries to
tpay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away.

ttttSIDRA (cont'd)
ttMost of us don't win championships our

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttPlease, I went through the same drama as
tteverybody else.  I mean, the first four
ttmonths, only person I could talk to was
ttthis chick Luisa, who knew like ten words
ttof English from watching old "Dif'rent
ttStrokes" reruns.  Swear to God, I had to
tttell her if she said, "What you talking
ttbout, Willis?" one more time, I was
ttgonna kick her ass.

tSidra laughs.  They watch the madness out on the dance floor.

<b>ttttSIDRA
</b>ttSo what are these Spanish guys like?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttI wouldn't know.

<b>ttttSIDRA
</b>ttWhat?  You've been over here seven months
ttand you ain't tapped anything?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttJust not my type, I guess.

<b>ttttSIDRA
</b>ttShoot, Italian boys love them some black
ttwomen.  They can't get enough of me.

tMonica smiles.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttYou ever think about going back?

<b>ttttSIDRA
</b>ttSometimes.  But what's the alternative,
ttnot playing?  You remember big Toni?
ttt(off Monica's nod)
ttShe quit last year, now she's working at

ttThey treat us like we're Hollywood stars
ttover here.  We just played in the

ttsweeter than this.

tMonica takes this in.  Her eyes do not reflect someone on top

tKyra packs up a suitcase.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttSo how long is this trip?

<b>ttttKYRA
</b>ttFour days.

tQuincy nods.

ttttKYRA (cont'd)
ttSo are you going to be the kind of
tthusband who won't let his wife work?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttNah.

<b>ttttKYRA
</b>ttt(playfully)
ttWhy not?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttYou might be the only one with a job.

<b>ttttKYRA
</b>ttBaby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's
ttgoing well.  You'll be back before you
ttknow it.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttSometimes I wonder if it's worth it.
ttBusting my ass, for what?

<b>ttttKYRA
</b>ttTo do what you love.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttI don't know sometimes.

<b>ttttKYRA
</b>ttYou're just scared.  I know rehab is
tthard, and you have to worry about whether
ttyou'll be as good as you were but you
ttwill be.  I believe in you.  You just
tthave to get back on the court.  Like
ttyou'd get back on a horse.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttt(beat)
ttA horse?

<b>ttttKYRA
</b>ttDon't make fun of me when I'm being
ttwonderful and supportive.
ttt(then)
ttYou belong on the court.  Just like I
ttbelong in the stands, looking cute and
ttcheering you on.

tShe smiles, gives him a kiss, moves back to her packing.  Off
tQuincy:

<b>tINT. BANK - DAY
</b>
tMonica sits at her desk in a blouse and skirt, punching
tnumbers into the computer.  A man sits down in the chair
topposite her.  Monica glances up.  It's her father.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttHey, munchkin.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttDad.  What are you doing here?

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttI was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been
tthearing good things about you.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttThat tends to happen when you're the
ttboss's daughter.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttSo how's the job going?

tMonica forces a smile.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttYou know.

tNathan looks at her, nods.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttI think I know what the problem is.

tHe pulls a GARBAGE CAN HOOP from a plastic shopping bag.
tMonica smiles.  He attaches it to her garbage can.

ttttNATHAN (cont'd)
ttThere.

tHe shoots an ugly, imaginary shot.  She laughs.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttYou shoot like a girl.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttI'll take that as a compliment.

tHe gives her a smile, and exits.  Monica looks at the hoop,
tthen crumples a piece of paper.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttAnd she gets the steal.  Monica goes one-
tton-one against Jordan, she stops, pops...

tMonica shoots.  The paper drops through the net.

ttttMONICA (cont'd)
ttt(still whispering)
ttIt's good!  It's good!

tShe glances up, notices a few patrons watching her.  Monica
tquickly composes herself and goes back to her work.

<b>tEXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - DUSK
</b>
tMonica exits her car, after a long day at work.  She wears
tvery low heels.  But she still stumbles.  She curses, then
thears a laugh.

tShe looks up - Quincy sits on the grassy hill above her
thouse.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttI remember when your mom had to beat you
ttinto a dress.

tMonica smiles.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttYou visiting?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttt(nods)
ttKyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured
ttI'd keep Mom company.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttWho's this guy I always see her around?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttDarryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttSo...how's the knee?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttGetting there.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttStrong enough to get you down the aisle?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttYeah.  Two weeks.
ttt(then)
ttI didn't get to send you an invitation,
ttbut if you...

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttThat's okay.  I'm probably, you know,
ttbusy.

tQuincy nods.  Awkward beat.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttCan I ask you something?

tMonica looks at him.

ttttQUINCY (cont'd)
ttYou never told me why ball isn't fun
ttanymore.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttIt just isn't.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttBecause I'm kinda feeling that way, too.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttYou had a rough couple years, that's all.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttThat a nice way of saying I rode the
ttbench?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttAnd you tore up your knee.  Rehab is
tttough.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttNah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four
ttand a half months.  Maybe I miss some of
ttthe attention, but besides that...

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttYou're serious.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttSeems like I needed a ball when I was
tttrying to be like my pops...or trying to
ttbe better than him.  Now, I kinda think I
ttneed to try something else.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttLike what?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttMaybe go back to school.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttWow.

tMonica stares at him, seeing a man in the boy she grew up
twith.  Quincy looks away, self-conscious.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttI mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school
ttthing yet.
ttt(then)
ttShe'll probably say it's the painkillers
tttalking.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttIt's a trip, you know?  When you're a
ttkid, you see the life you want, and it
ttnever crosses your mind that it's not
ttgonna turn out that way.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttSo why'd you give up ball?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttWhy do you keep asking me that?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttCause I don't get it.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttSomething was just missing.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttWhat?

tMonica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttIt doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave
ttit alone.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttFind.

tMonica turns, crosses to her house.  She stumbles on her
theels, kicks them off in frustration, and exits inside.
tQuincy walks back to his curb.

</b>
tCamille watches from the kitchen window

<b>tttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:

tLena sits next to Camille.  Her one year old son, L.P., sits
ton the ground at her feet.  Monica sits quietly nearby,
twatching.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttSo you're still breast-feeding?

<b>ttttLENA
</b>ttThe doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm

tShe quickly looks over at Monica.

ttttLENA (cont'd)
ttShut up.

tMonica gives her a small smile.  Camille looks down at L.P.

</b>ttYou might want to put a jacket on him,

<b>ttttLENA
</b>ttHe's fine.

ttOkay.

tLena sighs, rolls her eyes.  She picks up her son.

<b>ttttLENA
</b>ttCome on, L.P.  Grandma says it's too
ttcold.

tShe exits inside.  Camille makes a face.

<b>ttttCAMILLE
</b>ttGod.  "Grandma."

tMonica smiles.  And then silence.  There is still so much
tdistance between them, so many misunderstanding.  Camille
tstares at her daughter.  And then...

ttttCAMILLE (cont'd)
ttYou know, I'd probably be a lot more
tt"prissy" in the situation than you'd
ttlike, but the thing I always admired that
ttdrove me crazy, was the fight you had in
ttyou.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

</b>ttWhen I said Quincy could do better, I was
ttthinking about you.

tMonica stares at her mom.  Camille stands and leaves.

tMonica lies in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to

tsleep.  Her mind races with thoughts of her past, her

tchoices, her future...



tSuddenly, she climbs out of bed.  She wears a tank-top and
tpajama bottoms.  She crosses to her window, pulls it open and
tclimbs out.

</b>
tMonica drops down.  She moves to Quincy's window and knocks
tquietly.  Beat, then Quincy appears.  Bare-chested and in a
tpair of shorts.  He looks at her, then pulls open the window.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttt(half-asleep)
ttWhat's going on?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttWe need to talk.

tQuincy just looks at her.

ttttMONICA (cont'd)
ttPlease.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttHold on.

tQuincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T-
tshirt.  He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground.

tQuincy looks at her.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttYou asked me what was missing.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttFrom basketball.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttyou woke me up to tell me that?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttIt's not fun for me anymore because

tQuincy stares at her.

ttttMONICA (cont'd)
ttWhat I'm trying to say is --

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttI heard enough.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttWhat I'm trying to say is, I've loved you

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttWe haven't talked since college and now
ttyou wait two weeks before my wedding to
ttsay something like this?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttI know, I probably should have said it
tttwo weeks ago.

tQuincy doesn't even crack a smile.  In fact, he glares.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttYou haven't changed.  You still think the
ttsun rises and sets on your ass.  Well,
ttguess what, it doesn't.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttThen why are you so upset?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttBecause you don't pull this on someone
ttwho's about to get married.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttBetter late than never, right?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttWrong.

tQuincy starts back toward the window.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttI'll play you.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttOne game.  One-on-one.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttFor what?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttYour heart.

tQuincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the
tabsurdity.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttYou're out of your mind.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttSo you're gonna bitch up?

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttWhat's that supposed to be, psychology?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttI know why you broke up with me in
ttcollege.  And not that what you did
ttwasn't messed up, but what I did was,
tttoo.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive
ttyou.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttMonica, after that stuff with my dad, I
ttcouldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I
ttwas lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that
ttwas five years ago.  I moved on.

tMonica moves past him, reaches through his window.  She drops
tback down, holding his basketball.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttProve it.

tShe throws him the ball.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttWhat will this prove?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttYou once said the reason I beat you was
ttbecause you wanted me to.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttSo?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttSo, if I win it's because deep down you
ttknow you're about to make the biggest

ttwant me to stop you.

tbasketball gear.



tThey stare at each other, ready to go to war. Monica tosses
thim the ball.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttCheck.

tQuincy tosses the ball back.  Monica drives.  Quincy's knee
tis maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up.  She scores
teasily.

tShe walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball.

ttttMONICA (cont'd)
ttOne, zip.  Check.

tQuincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back.

tThe game continues.  Monica owns the first five points easily
tby exploiting Quincy's injury.

tMonica drives for another lay-up.  Quincy suddenly lets go of
this fear, leaps and swats her shot.

tHe grabs the rebound and lays it up.  He nods intensely, as
the grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key.

<b>ttttQUINCY
</b>ttOne, five.  Check.

tThe game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using
this size and strength.  He scores seven straight points.

tThe score stays close.  It is a sexually-charged battle of
twills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt.  Their
tbodies collide as they wrestle for the ball.  Monica yanks
toff her jersey in frustration.  Her ass bumps into his hips
tas she backs him in.  Her hands slide across his chest as she
tguards him...

tFinally, the score hits nine, nine.  Monica slowly walks to
tthe top of the key.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttNine, up.  Point.

tShe tosses Quincy the ball.

ttttMONICA (cont'd)
ttCheck.

tQuincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense.  Monica
tfakes an outside shot and Quincy bites.  Monica drives around
thim.  SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP.  SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT
tROLLS OFF THE RIM.  Monica can't believe it.

tQuincy grabs the loose ball and clears it.  He stares at
tMonica as he dribbles in front of her.  She stares back.

tHe breaks for the basket.  Monica stays with him.  He goes
tup.  Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot.
tQuincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground.  He lets go
tof the rim, and tumbles to the ground also.  GAME OVER.

tSilence.  Quincy stares at her.  Monica looks back.  Then:

ttAll's fair in love and basketball, right?

tMonica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up.
tShe slowly walks back toward her house.  And then:

ttHey.

tMonica slowly stops, turns.

ttttQUINCY (cont'd)
ttDouble or nothing.

tMonica stares at him, wonders if she heard right.  Quincy
tlimps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her.

tMonica slowly walks back to him.  They stare at each other.
tNo more egos, no more bullshit.  Just love.
