<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. TOWNHOUSE GARDEN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
</b>
tAn afternoon in late November, the leaves have left the
ttrees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches.
tThe garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a
thigh brick wall. At one end stands the rear of a three-story
tbrick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building.
tCLASSICAL MUSIC is heard in the distance. A MAN, handsomely
tdressed in a well-tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the
tgarden. A gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth
tas he turns the loam along one of the walkways. He works
tslowly,-precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings.
tThis man is called CHANCE.

tChance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from
tinside his coat, checks the time. He looks to the darkening
tskies, returns the watch to his pocket. As Chance starts
ttoward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag
tfrom his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of
this pitchfork.

<b>tINT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON
</b>
tThe sound of the music increases as Chance enters the garage
tfrom the garden. A gleaming 1921 TOURING CAR is revealed as
the walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a
twall. Chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf,
tcarefully puts it over the car. When he finishes covering the
tcar for the night, Chance picks up the pitchfork, leaves the
tgarage through a side entry.

<b>tINT. POTTING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
tThe Potting Room is filled with the tools of the gardener,
teverything arranged in an orderly fashion. Rows of small pots
tare on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them. A
tsmall, 1940's table model black-and-white TV rests on a
tshelf. It is playing, tuned to the BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA.
tAttached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing
tcolored gels. The wheels spins, creates an early form of
tcolor TV. As Chance enters, his attention is on the
ttelevision set. He watches it as he oils the tines of the
tpitchfork and puts it away. Chance turns off the TV and
tleaves the room, but the sound of the Boston Pops continues.

<b>tINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
tA room adjacent to the Potting Room. A large screen remote
tcontrol color television set dominates the room. It is on,
ttuned to the Boston Pops. In contrast to the new TV, the rest
tof the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with
texpensive furniture of the twenties. There are no books,
tmagazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be
tseen. Chance comes in, watches the TV with a detached gaze as
the removes his apron. He changes the channel with the remote
tcontrol as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a
tlaundry bag. He takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the
tcloset where it is accompanied by several others, all of like
tquality. Chance changes the channel once again.

<b>tEXT. GARDEN - NIGHT
</b>
tChance, wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry
tbag, crosses from the rear building to the main house.

<b>tINT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tThe interior of the main house has the mustiness of age, the
twarmth of oak. White dropcloths and sheets cover all of the
tfurniture. Chance enters, walks through the hallway.

<b>tINT. MAIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tA large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs.
tIt is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and
tplace setting uncovered. A small portable color TV is next to
tthe place setting.

tChance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near
tthe doorway. He sits at the dining room table, turns on the
tTV, and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as
the watches the screen. LOUISE, an elderly black maid, enters
twith a tray of food and Chance's clean laundry.

<b>ttttLOUISE
</b>ttt(sets dinner before
ttttChance)
tt... Evening, Chance.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(slowly, perfect diction,
ttttno accent of any kind)
tt... Good evening, Louise.

tLouise sets Chance's clean clothes on the small table, picks
tup his laundry bag.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>tt... The Old Man is getting weaker,
ttChance.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(begins to eat)
ttI see.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>ttI'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with
ttevery hour that goes by...

tChance, his manners impeccable, concentrates on the TV as he
teats. A buzzer SOUNDS, Louise looks upstairs.

<b>ttttLOUISE (CONT'D)
</b>tt... Back up those stairs - damn...
ttThat Man's needin' me more and more
ttjust before he never needs me
ttagain...

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(still watches TV)
ttIs his back feeling better?

tLouise gives Chance a look.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>tt... Gobbledegook... You and your
ttgobbledegook. You're gonna be the
ttdeath of me yet, Chance...
ttt(she turns to leave)
tt... Unless those stairs are... The
ttGood Lord's liable to snatch up two
ttunwillin' souls at the same time if
ttI keep on trampin' up those
ttstairs... I don't want none of
ttthat...

tLouise disappears through the doorway. Chance continues to
teat and watch TV.

<b>tINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN
</b>
tChance is asleep, lying on his back. His eyes slowly open,
tand, with no change of expression, he sits up and turns on
tthe TV with the remote control. Chance gets out of bed, goes
tto the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer,
tchecks the time. He crosses to the closet, his eyes never
tstraying from an early morning show on television. He puts on
ta bathrobe and leaves the room.

<b>tINT. POTTING ROOM - DAWN
</b>
tChance enters, turns on the TV with the spinning color wheel,
tthen waters a few of the pots with a sprinkling can. He turns
toff the TV and exits.

<b>tINT. GARAGE - DAWN
</b>
tChance comes into the garage, takes the cover off of the
ttouring car, folds it and puts it on a shelf. He leaves the
tgarage.

<b>tINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN
</b>
tChance returns to his room, changes channels on the
ttelevision, takes off his robe and hangs it back up in the
tcloset, then goes into the bathroom.

<b>tEXT. GARDEN - MORNING
</b>
tA light snow is falling. The door to the small building
topens, Chance peeks out, then goes back inside. A few seconds
tpass and Chance reappears, this time with an umbrella.
tSmartly dressed in suit and tie, he crosses to the main
thouse.

<b>tINT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - MORNING
</b>
tChance opens the door, shakes off and closes the umbrella
tbefore entering. He hangs the umbrella on a doorknob, then
theads for the dining room.

<b>tINT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
tRepeating his ritual, Chance enters the dining room, sits,
tturns on the TV, carefully spreads his napkin on his lap. He
twatches the screen for a moment, then turns, expecting
tLouise. She doesn't appear, so he turns back, watches TV.
tAfter a few beats, Chance hears Louise's footsteps hurrying
tdown the stairs. She comes into the dining room, visibly
tdistraught. Chance looks up, smiles.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttGood morning, Louise.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>ttt(out of breath)
ttHe's dead, Chance! The Old Man's
ttdead!

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(flatly, turns back to TV)
tt... I see.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>ttMust of happened durin' the night,
ttI don't know... Lord, he wasn't
ttbreathin' and as cold as a fish. I
tttouched him, just to see, and you
ttbelieve me, Chance - that's doin'
ttmore than I get paid to do... Then
ttI just covered him up, pulled the
ttsheet over his head...

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(nodding)
ttYes. I've seen that done.

<b>ttttLOUISE
</b>ttThen I got the hell out of that
ttroom and called the doctor and I
ttthink I woke him probably, he
ttwasn't any too alert. He just said,
tt'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and
ttsaid he'd send somebody over...'
ttLord, what a mornin'!

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(watches news, flashes of
ttttseason's first snowfall)
tt... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in
ttthe garden today. Have you looked
ttoutside and seen the snow? It's
ttvery white.

tA beat of silence from Louise, then anger.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>ttDammit, Boy! Is that all you got to
ttsay? More gobbledegook? 
ttt(Chance smiles, is silent)
ttThat Old Man's layin' up there dead
ttas hell and it just don't make any
ttdifference to you!

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(with a smile, accepting
ttttdeath)
ttYes, Louise. I have seen it often.
ttIt happens to old people.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>ttWell, ain't that the truth...

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. It is.

tLouise throws back the cover from a chair next to Chance and
tsits, softening a bit toward him.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>ttOh, Lord, Chance - I don't know
ttwhat I was expectin' from you...
ttI'm sorry for yellin' like I did...
ttNo sir, I just don't know what I
ttwas expectin' ... 
ttt(Chance doesn't react,
ttttwatches TV)
tt... I 'spose I'd better gather up
ttsome breakfast for you...

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(a turn to her)
ttYes, I'm very hungry.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>ttt(rises, looks upstairs)
ttWell, no more stewin' those prunes
ttevery mornin', that's somethin', I
ttguess... 
ttt(she starts out, stops by
ttttthe door)
tt... what are you goin' to do now,
ttChance?

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(gazing at TV)
ttI'm going to work in the garden.

tLouise gives Chance a long look, then turns to leave.

<b>ttttLOUISE
</b>ttt(as she goes)
tt... I'll get you some eggs.

tChance nods in approval, then changes the channel on the TV.

<b>tINT. MAIN HOUSE - SERVANT'S STAIRWAY - MORNING
</b>
tAn enclosed stairway. Chance enters, proceeds up the stairs.

<b>tINT. MAIN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING
</b>
tChance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase.
tHe moves off down the hall.

<b>tINT. MAIN HOUSE - OLD MAN'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>
tThe furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the
tOld Man is. There is a polite knock at the door, then Chance
tenters the room. As Chance moves slowly to the Old Man's bed,
twe sense a feeling of respect from Chance, as well as a bit
tof curiosity. Chance stands by the side of the bed for a
tmoment, then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back
tfrom the Old Man's face. He touches the man's forehead,
tlightly, briefly, then replaces the sheet. Chance moves to
tthe TV (like the one in his own room) and turns it on. He
tsits in an easy chair next to the Old man's bed and watches a
tmovie from the early forties. Chance puts an arm out, rests
tit on the Old Man's covered body. With the other, he changes
tthe channels with the remote control.
tHe returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to
tbecome absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat
tto a lady. The scene seems to have 'sunk into' his mind.

<b>tEXT. GARDEN - MORNING
</b>
tIt has stopped snowing. Chance, wearing a hat, the gardening
tapron over his suit and boots, putters in the garden. Louise
tcomes out of the main house. She is dressed warmly, a scarf
tover her head, a heavy coat. Chance sees her, tips his hat to
tLouise exactly like the man he saw on television.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>tt... Well, ain't you the gentleman
ttthis mornin'...
ttt(a pause)
tt... gotta go now, Chance...

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(resumes working)
ttYes.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>ttYou're gonna need somebody,
ttsomeone's gotta be around for you,
ttboy... 
ttt(he keeps working)
tt... You oughta find yourself a
ttlady, Chance... 
ttt(she smiles slightly, with
ttttcaring)
ttBut I guess it oughta be an old
ttlady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a
ttyoung one any good, not with that
ttlittle thing of yours... 
ttt(she reaches out, puts a
tttthand on his shoulder)
tt... You're always gonna be a little
ttboy, ain't you? 
ttt(he smiles, keeps working)
tt... Goodbye, Chance...

tLouise gives his shoulder a squeeze, turns and moves toward
tthe house.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(as she goes)
ttGoodbye, Louise.

tLouise waves as she enters the townhouse. Chance tips his hat
tonce again as she disappears.

<b>tINT. MAIN HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - MORNING
</b>
tLouise enters the hallway, picks up a couple of suit cases
twaiting by the door. She stops as she sees TWO MEN in white
tcarrying a stretcher down the main staircase. She notices the
tease with which they bring the Old Man's body down the
tstairs.

<b>ttttLOUISE 
</b>tt... He used to be a big man...
tt'Spose he wasted away to about
ttnothin'... 
ttt(a beat - then she talks
ttttto the body of the old
ttttMan)
tt... I guess I'll be goin' off to
ttfind me some folks, Old Man... I'm
ttnot batty enough to stay around
ttthis neighborhood any longer...

tThe stretcher bearers move to the front door. Louise steps in
tfront of them.

<b>ttttLOUISE (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(to stretcher bearers)
ttWait up! I'm goin' out that door
ttfirst.

tLouise takes one more look at the covered body, then opens
tthe front door, leaves.

<b>tINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe TV plays offstage as Chance washes up in the bathroom. He
tfinishes, comes into the bedroom, takes a pair of house
tslippers from his closet, turns off the television and leaves
tthe room.

<b>tEXT. GARDEN - DAY
</b>
tChance, carrying his slippers, crosses through the layer of
tfresh snow to the townhouse.

<b>tINT. DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tChance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place.
tHe turns on the TV, puts the napkin on his lap. He watches TV
tfor a moment, then turns, looks for Louise. She does not
tappear so he resumes watching TV. He changes channels, views
ta wildly exciting FOOTBALL game. At a peak in the excitement,
the again switches channels. Chance watches TV News coverage
tof the PRESIDENT of the United States greeting foreign
tdignitaries at the White House.
tCLOSE SHOTS on television reveal that the President uses a
ttwo-handed handshake when meeting his guests. Unconsciously,
tChance grips one hand with the other, the scene on TV seeming
tto have 'sunk into' his mind.

<b>tINT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tA key is heard in the lock. The door opens and THOMAS
tFRANKLIN and SALLY HAYES enter. Franklin, an attorney, is in
this late thirties, carries a large briefcase. Hayes is
tyounger, attractive, also an attorney. She totes a briefcase,
thas the look of a modern, liberated woman. Hayes appears to
tbe surprised at the interior of the house.

<b>ttttHAYES
</b>ttt(looks around)
tt... This is another world, Tom - I
ttnever would have believed it...

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttYeah... He and my father used to
ttride together back in the
ttthirties... Fox hunting... Before I
ttwas born...

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>tt... Would you take me on a tour?

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttGladly... 
ttt(he smiles)
tt... The safe is in Mr. Jennings'
ttbedroom, that'll be stop number
ttone.

tFranklin puts a hand on Hayes' shoulder as they,go off down
tthe hall.

<b>tINT. DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tChance still watches TV, waits for Louise to serve him.
tFranklin and Hayes appear in the doorway of the dining room.
tThey are both surprised to see Chance.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>tt... Why... Hello, we thought we
ttheard something... 
ttt(moves to Chance, hand
ttttoutstretched)
ttI'm Thomas Franklin.

tChance remains seated, takes Franklin's hand warmly in both
tof his like the President did on TV.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttHello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the
ttgardener.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttt(a beat)
tt... The gardener? 
ttt(thinks it's a joke,
ttttlaughs)
tt... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance,
ttthis is Ms. Hayes.

tHayes moves to shake Chance's hand.

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>ttMr. Chance, I'm very pleased to
ttmeet you.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(doesn't rise, again
ttttshakes with both hands)
ttYes.

tChance turns back to the TV and Hayes and Franklin exchange
tlooks.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttt(after an uneasy pause)
tt... We're with Franklin, Jennings
ttand Roberts, the law firm handling
ttthe estate.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(a smile, totally at ease)
ttYes, Thomas - I understand.

tAnother period of silence. Franklin and Hayes seem perplexed.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>tt... Are you waiting for someone? An
ttappointment?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. I'm waiting for my lunch.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttYour lunch? You have a luncheon
ttappointment here?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. Louise will bring me lunch.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttLouise?... The maid?...
ttt(a look to Hayes)
ttBut she should have left earlier
tttoday...

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(smiles at Hayes)
ttI see...

<b>ttttFRANKLIN
</b>ttt(a beat)
tt... You've quite a sense of humor,
ttMr. Chance - but all kidding aside,
ttmay I ask just what you are doing
tthere?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI live here.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttYou live here?
ttt(a look to Hayes)
tt... We don't have any record of
ttthat.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. It's very cold outside today,
ttisn't it, Thomas?

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttt(a beat)
tt... How long have you been living
tthere?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttEver since I can remember, since I
ttwas a child.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttt(doubting)
ttSince you were a child?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, Thomas. I have always been
tthere. I have always worked in the
ttgarden.

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>tt... Then you really are a gardener?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>ttYour appearance doesn't suggest
ttthat at all, Mr. Chance.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttOh. Thank you.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttDo you have any proof of your
ttemployment, Mr. Chance - any checks
ttfrom the deceased, any contracts or
ttdocuments?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttHow were you compensated for these
ttduties you say you performed?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttCompensated...?

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttHow were you paid?

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttI was given meals, and a home...

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>ttWhat about money?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI never needed money.

tFranklin steps to the TV, turns it off.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttMr. Chance, perhaps you could show
ttus some identification with your
ttaddress -- a Driver's License, a
ttcredit card, checkbook?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo, I do not have any of those.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttThen how about medical records?
ttCould you give us the name of your
ttdoctor, or your dentist?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI have no need for a doctor or
ttdentist. I have never been ill. I
tthave never been allowed outside of
ttthis house, and, except for Joe, I
tthave never had any visitors.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>tt... Joe? Who's Joe?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(turns TV back on)
ttJoe Saracini. He was a mason that
ttdid some repairs on the brickwork
ttat the rear of the house. That was
ttin 1952.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b><b>tt1952...?
</b>
<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(changes channels)
ttYes. I remember when he came. He
ttwas very fat and had short hair and
ttshowed me some pictures from a
ttfunny little book.

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>ttSome pictures...?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. Of men and women.

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>tt... Oh.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttMr. Chance, that was twenty-seven
ttyears ago.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes and the Old Man used to come to
ttmy garden. He would read and rest
ttthere.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttCome now, Mr. Jennings had been
ttbedridden for thirty-five years,
ttsince he fractured his spine.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, Thomas, that is correct. Then
tthe stopped visiting my garden.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttt(a beat)
tt... We shall need some proof of
ttyour having resided here, Mr.
ttChance.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYou have me, I am here. What more
ttproof do you need?

tFranklin and Hayes exchange looks.

<b>tINT. TOWNHOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
</b>
tChance puts on his snow-boots as Franklin and Hayes continue
ttheir questioning.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttHave you served in the Army?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo, Thomas. But I have seen the
ttArmy on television.

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>ttHow about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely
ttyou must have paid taxes?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo.

tChance picks up his slippers and leads the attorneys outside.

<b>tEXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON
</b>
tChance describes his garden with pride as they walk toward
tthe rear building.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(points)
ttThose trees were very young when I
ttfirst arrived.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttAre you related to the deceased,
ttMr. Chance?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo, I don't think so. And I have
ttplanted and shaped all the hedges,
ttand in the springtime you will be
ttable to see my flowers.

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>ttMight you have a birth certificate,
ttMr. Chance?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo.
ttt(points to wall)
ttThat's where Joe fixed the bricks.

tThey arrive at the rear building and Chance opens the door to
tthe garage. Franklin and Hayes follow him inside.

<b>tINT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON
</b>
tFranklin and Hayes are taken aback by the touring car.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN
</b>ttt(admires car)
tt... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo, Thomas. I have never been in an
ttautomobile.

<b>ttttHAYES
</b>ttt(amazed)
ttYou never been in a car?

tChance is silent for a moment, he blushes slightly.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>tt... Well... From time to time I did
ttsit in it... Just in here... It
tthasn't been outside since the Old
ttMan hurt himself.
ttt(he turns)
ttI live in here.

tChance moves toward his room, Franklin and Hayes follow.

<b>tINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
tChance sits on the bed to remove his boots as Hayes and
tFranklin inspect the room.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttThe Old Man gave me nice television
ttsets, this one has remote control.
ttt(he turns it on with the
ttttremote)
ttHe has one just like it.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttMr. Chance, the fact remains that
ttwe have no information of your
tthaving any connection with the
ttdeceased.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, I understand.

tChance puts on his slippers, crosses to the closet, opens the
tdoor. It is filled with men's wear.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI am allowed to go to the attic and
ttselect any of the Old Man's suits.
ttThey all fit me very well. I can
ttalso take his shirts, shoes and
ttcoats.

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>ttIt is quite amazing how those
ttclothes have come back into style.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. I have seen styles on
tttelevision.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN
</b>ttt(getting back to business)
ttWhat are your plans now, Mr.
ttChance?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI would like to stay and work in my
ttgarden.

tChance turns to watch TV. Franklin takes Hayes to a side of
tthe room.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttt(quietly)
tt... What do you make of all this?

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>ttI really don't know, Tom - he seems
ttso honest and simple... In a way,
tthe's quite charming...

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttt(looks at Chance)
tt... Yeah...

<b>ttttHAYES 
</b>tt... It's very bizarre - I don't
ttknow what to think...

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttWell... He's either very, very
ttbright or very, very dense - he's
tthard to figure...
ttt(he unzips briefcase)
tt... Let's just keep everything
ttlegal.

tFranklin takes out some papers, approaches Chance.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttMr. Chance, assuming what you say
ttis the truth, I would like to know
ttwhat sort of claim you are planning
ttto make against the deceased's
ttestate.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(does not understand)
ttI'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a
tthealthy one. There is no need for a
ttclaim.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttGood. That's good. Then if you
ttwould please sign a paper to that
tteffect.

tFranklin hands the release to Chance but Chance does not take
tit.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo, Thomas. I don't know how to
ttsign.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttCome now, Mr. Chance.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(smiles)
ttI have no claim, Thomas.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttBut you won't sign, correct?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttCorrect.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttVery well, Mr. Chance - if you
ttinsist on dragging this matter
tton... But I must inform you this
tthouse will be closed tomorrow at
ttnoon. If indeed, you do reside
tthere, you will have to move out.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttMove out? I don't understand,
ttThomas.

<b>ttttFRANKLIN 
</b>ttI think you do, Mr. Chance.
ttHowever, I will reiterate, this
tthouse is closed and you must
ttleave...
ttt(he gives Chance his
ttttbusiness card)
ttCall me if you change your mind
ttabout signing.
ttt(turns to Hayes)
ttC'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...

<b>ttttHAYES
</b>ttt(a smile to Chance)
ttGood day, Mr. Chance.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(returns smile)
ttGood day, Sally.

tChance watches as they leave, then puts Franklin's card on a
tdesk without ever looking at it and turns to stare at
ttelevision.

<b>tINT. TOWNHOUSE - ATTIC - AFTERNOON
</b>
tA large attic filled with the Old Man's possessions of the
tpast. Chance enters, turns on an old black-and-white TV with
ta magnifying lens attached to the front. As it plays, he
tselects a fine leather suitcase from several, takes a hand
tmade suit from a long rack.

<b>tINT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
tThe TV is on as Chance packs his belongings.

<b>tEXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON
</b>
tChance, very nicely dressed, comes out of the rear building
tcarrying his suitcase. He stops on occasion to inspect his
tgarden as he walks toward the townhouse.

<b>tINT. TOWNHOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
</b>
tChance is reluctant to open the front door. After some
thesitation, he gathers up his courage, opens it and steps
toutside, closing the door behind him.

<b>tEXT. FRONT OF TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON
</b>
tChance stops short on the front steps; the townhouse is
tsituated in a decaying ghetto.
tThe snow is a dirty grey, houses adjoining have their windows
tshattered, are smeared with grafitti. Chance tries to return
tto the safety of the townhouse, but the door is locked. He
tstands on the steps for a moment, then moves to the trash
tladen sidewalk. He stops, ponders which way to go, finally
tmakes up his mind and moves off to his left.

<b>tEXT. GHETTO STREET - AFTERNOON
</b>
tThe buildings are crumbling, rusted out cars line the street.
tA group of Black people huddle together in threadbare stuffed
tfurniture on the sidewalk, a fire burning between them for
twarmth. Chance rounds the corner, walks up to them. He stands
tby them, smiles. They stare back, no sign of friendship in
ttheir faces. Chance nods politely to them, then walks away
tdown the sidewalk.

<b>tEXT. GHETTO STREET - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
</b>
tA group of eight to ten hard-core ghetto youths hang out on a
tcorner. Other passersby give them a wide berth, they are
tunapproachable. Chance nears the group, approaches.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(friendly)
tt... Excuse me, would you please
tttell me where I could find a garden
ttto work in?

tThey turn to him as one, silent, amazed that this White
ttrespasser would intrude on their jiving.

<b>ttttCHANCE (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(after a beat)
tt... There is much to be done during
ttthe winter, I must start the seeds
ttfor the spring, I must work the
ttsoil...

tOne of the Black youths, LOLO, interrupts Chance.

<b>ttttLOLO 
</b>ttWhat you growin', man?

tThe leader of the gang, ABBAZ, shuts up Lolo with an elbow
tand moves menacingly forward.

<b>ttttABBAZ 
</b>ttt(nose to nose with Chance)
tt... What you doin' here, boy?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI had to leave my garden. I want to
ttfind another.

<b>ttttABBAZ 
</b>ttBullshit. Who sent you here, boy?
ttDid that chickenshit asshole
ttRaphael send you here, boy?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo. Thomas Franklin told me that I
tthad to leave the Old Man's house,
tthe's dead now, you know...

<b>ttttABBAZ 
</b>ttDead, my ass! Now get this, honkie -
ttyou go tell Raphael that I ain't
tttakin' no jive from no Western
ttUnion messenger! You tell that
ttasshole, if he got somethin' to
tttell me to get his ass here
tthimself! 
ttt(edges closer to Chance)
ttYou got that, boy?

tChance smiles at Abbaz and reaches into his pocket.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. I understand. 
ttt(he takes out his remote
ttttcontrol TV changer)
ttIf I see Raphael I will tell him.

tChance points the changer at Abbaz and clicks it three times,
ttries to change the picture. Abbaz immediately pulls out a
tswitchblade, whips the blade open.

<b>ttttABBAZ
</b>ttt(holds knife at Chance)
ttNow, move, honkie! Before I cut
ttyour white ass!

tChance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns
tit to his pocket.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. Of course.
ttt(as he leaves)
ttGood day.

tAbbaz, Lolo and the gang watch him go, then begin to buzz
twith excitement: "Who the fuck died?" "Why'd he pull that
tchanger on us, man?" "The Old Man died, must be Papa Joe!"
t"He's some weird honkie, man."

<b>tEXT. CHINATOWN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
</b>
tA Bulletin board affixed to a storefront in Chinatown. Chance
tgazes at the notes pinned to it, written in Chinese. Smiling,
the turns from it, walks on through the area.

<b>tEXT. PORNO AREA - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
</b>
tA street lined with adult book stores, X-rated movies and
tstrip joints. An elderly Black woman approaches carrying a
tbag of groceries. Chance steps in front of the woman, stops
ther.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI'm very hungry now. Would you
ttplease bring me my lunch?

tThe woman looks up to Chance, becomes very frightened. She
tturns and half-runs into a sleazy bar for safety. Chance
twatches after her for a moment, then continues along.

<b>tEXT. PARK - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
</b>
tChance stands looking through a chain-link fence watching
tsome teenage boys playing basketball. He bangs on the fence,
tcalls to them.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI have seen your game! I have
ttwatched Elvin Hayes play it many
tttimes! They call him "Big E!"

tThe boys ignore him, Chance walks away.

<b>tEXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
tChance walks down the center meridian of a divided street. He
tseems oblivious to the automobiles passing on either side. In
tthe background can be seen the Washington Monument.

<b>tEXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
tChance seems stumped on which way to go. He looks up one
tstreet, then the other, has no idea where they lead. He
tturns, looks behind him and sees a large statue of Benito
tJuarez pointing. Chance smiles and goes off in the direction
tthat Benito points.

<b>tEXT. REAR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DUSK
</b>
tTourists are gathered around gaping through the fence at the
tWhite House.
tChance is turned the other way, inspecting the branches of a
tdying tree. Chance moves to a POLICEMAN standing nearby.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttExcuse me...
ttt(points to tree)
tt... That tree is very sick. It
ttshould be cared for.

tThe Policeman looks at the tree, then at Chance, figures a
tman dressed that well must be important.

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN 
</b>ttYes sir. I'll report it right away.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. That would be a good thing to
ttdo. Good day.

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttGood day.

tThe Policeman takes out his walkie-talkie as Chance walks
taway.

<b>tEXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - EVENING
</b>
tA fashionable area. Expensive shops, well-kept streets and
tsidewalks. A television store has caught Chance's eye. He
tstands by the display window, looks in at a dozen or so color
tTVs, all turned on, playing various channels. A video camera
tpoints outward from a corner of the window and is focused on
tthe sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves
tlive on an Advent TV. Chance is intrigued by his own image.
tHe poses, lifts one arm, then the other to make sure that it
tis really him on television. He moves forward, smiles, then
tmoves slowly backward, notices himself become smaller on the
tscreen. He steps back off the curb, frowns as his likeness
tdisappears from frame on the Advent. Standing between two
tparked cars, Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it
tat the Advent. Four or five other sets in the window change
tchannels, but he does not reappear on the giant screen. As he
tdoes this, the car to his,left, a large, American-made
tlimousine, backs up. The car bumps Chance, pins him against
tthe car to his right. Chance cries out in pain, drops his
tsuitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the
tlimo. The chauffeur, DAVID, and the liveryman, JEFFREY,
timmediately jump from the car, run back to Chance.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI'm very sorry, sir... I...

tDavid and Jeffrey reach out to help, but Chance is wedged
tsolidly between the two cars.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(in pain)
tt... I can't move... My leg...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(rushes back to limo)
tt... My Lord...

<b>ttttJEFFREY
</b>ttThis is terrible, sir -  I hope
ttyou're not badly injured...

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo. I'm not badly injured. But my
ttleg is very sore.

tDavid pulls the car forward, freeing Chance. A few bystanders
tbegin to gather as Jeffrey helps Chance to the sidewalk.

<b>ttttJEFFREY 
</b>ttCan you walk? It's not broken, is
ttit?

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(leans against limo, holds
ttttleg)
ttIt's very sore.

tDavid gets out of the car, comes back.

<b>ttttDAVID 
</b>ttPerhaps I should call an ambulance.

tA BYSTANDER interrupts.

<b>ttttBYSTANDER 
</b>ttSomebody ought to call the police!

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(looks over, smiles)
ttThere's no need for police, it's
ttjust my leg.

tDuring this, the rear door of the limo opens and EVE RAND
tsteps out. Eve is in her late thirties, has the look of a
ttraditional New England lady. She watches as Jeffrey tends to
tChance.

<b>ttttJEFFREY 
</b>ttI don't think we should call anyone
ttjust yet, it may not even be all
ttthat serious.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(obviously hurting)
ttI agree.

<b>ttttJEFFREY 
</b>ttLet's have a look, do you mind?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttOf course. I would like to look.

tChance bends, raises his trouser leg. A red-bluish swollen
tbruise, three inches in diameter, is forming on his calf.

<b>ttttJEFFREY 
</b>ttIt's starting to swell, is it
ttpainful?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes.

tEve moves closer to Chance, looks at the bruise.

<b>ttttEVE
</b>ttt(to Chance)
tt... Won't you let us do something
ttfor you? Your leg should be
ttexamined, we could take you to a
tthospital.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(smiles at Eve)
ttThere's no need for a hospital.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttWhy, there certainly is. You must
ttsee a doctor, I insist on it.
ttPlease, let us take you.

tEve turns to get back into the limo. David goes with her to
thold the door.

<b>ttttDAVID 
</b>ttI'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Rand, I
ttnever saw the man.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttOh, I don't think it was anyone's
ttfault, David. 

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttThank you, ma'am.

tChance is hesitant about getting in the car. Jeffrey offers a
thelping hand.

<b>ttttJEFFREY
</b>ttPlease, sir.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI've never ridden in an automobile.

<b>ttttJEFFREY 
</b>ttt(a beat)
ttI assure you, sir, David is a very
ttcareful driver. Please, won't you
ttlet us take you?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(looks at the car, then
ttttdecides)
tt... Yes. You can take me.

<b>ttttJEFFREY 
</b>ttVery good.

tJeffrey assists Chance into the rear seat of the limo.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(as he gets in)
tt... My suitcase.

<b>ttttJEFFREY 
</b>ttYes sir. I'll take care of that.

tJeffrey closes the door, goes back to pick up Chance's
tsuitcase, does not notice the remote control. As Jeffrey puts
tChance's bag into the trunk, we see the personalized license
tplate "RAND l."

<b>tINT. LIMOUSINE - EVENING
</b>
tChance and Eve settle in the back seat. As they talk, David
tstarts up the limo, Jeffrey joins him in front and the limo
tpulls out into traffic.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttI hope you're comfortable.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. I am.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttThese can be such trying situations
tteveryone seems to make such a to-do
ttover a simple little accident. Of
ttcourse, they can be very
ttfrightening, and I must apologize
ttfor David, he's never had an
ttaccident before.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. He's a very careful driver.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>tt... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg
ttfeeling any better?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttIt's feeling better, but it's still
ttvery sore.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttI see.
ttt(a thought)
tt... Say, would you mind seeing our
ttfamily doctor?

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(doesn't understand)
ttYour family doctor?

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttYes. My husband has been very ill.
ttHis doctor and nurses are staying
ttwith us. Those hospitals can be so
ttimpersonal - why, it might be hours
ttbefore you are treated...

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttI agree.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttFine, it will save a lot of
ttunnecessary fuss and it will be so
ttmuch more pleasant for you...
ttt(leans forward)
ttDavid, we'll just go on home.
ttJeffrey, would you call and let
ttthem know?

<b>ttttJEFFREY 
</b>ttYes ma'am.

tEve presses a button, the glass partition closes. As the
twindow rolls up behind him, Jeffrey dials the limo telephone.

tThere is a moment of silence. Eve, still a bit on edge from
tthe accident and feeling a bit uncomfortable with a stranger
tin the car, presses another button. The limo's bar moves out,
trevealing a row of decanters and glasses.

<b>ttttEVE
</b>ttWould you care for a drink?

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttYes. Thank you.

tAs Eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass, Chance
tnotices the limo's TV set.

<b>ttttCHANCE (CONT'D)
</b>ttI would like to watch television.

<b>ttttEVE
</b>ttt(a bit surprised)
ttOh? Certainly...

tShe hands Chance the cognac, turns on the TV.

<b>ttttEVE (CONT'D)
</b>ttOh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttHello, Eve. 

tChance takes a sip of the cognac, is not accustomed to
talcohol, coughs. There is another moment of silence.

<b>ttttEVE
</b>ttMay I ask your name?

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(with a slight cough)
ttMy name is Chance.

<b>ttttEVE
</b>ttPardon me, was that Mr. Chance?

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(still indistinct)
ttNo. I'm a gardener.

<b>ttttEVE
</b>ttOh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey
ttGardiner... You're not related to
ttBasil and Perdita Gardiner are you?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo, Eve. I'm not related to Basil
ttand Perdita.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttOh. Well, they're just a wonderful
ttcouple, we've been friends for
ttyears. We visit their island quite
ttoften.

tChance reaches out to change the channel on the TV, suddenly
trealizes he doesn't have his remote control. He starts going
tthrough his pockets, searches for it.

<b>ttttEVE (CONT'D)
</b>ttDid you lose something?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. I lost my remote control.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttOh... Well, I'm very sorry...

tAnother pause, Chance reaches out, changes channels on TV.

<b>ttttEVE (CONT'D)
</b>tt... I'll feel so relieved after Dr.
ttAllenby examines your leg. After
ttthat, David can run you on home, or
ttto your office or wherever you'd
ttprefer... 
ttt(Chance still watches TV)
tt... Is there anything special you
ttwould like to watch?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI like to watch. This is fine.

tChance watches the news. Eve sips on her cognac as David
teases the limo out of the city of Washington.

<b>tEXT. HIGHWAY - WOODED AREA - NIGHT
</b>
tThe limo approaches, then turns into the entrance-way of the
tRand Estate. Two guards stand on either side of the open
tgate, salute as the car passes through.

<b>tEXT. RAND DRIVE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe drive runs alongside a stream, then turns and crosses a
tlarge meadow. The limousine passes, still no sign of the
thouse. It is a very, very long driveway.

<b>tINT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
</b>
tChance is glued to the TV, switches channels, again watches
tthe news. Eve takes his fascination with television as a sign
tof intelligence.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttI can see that it must be very
ttimportant for you to stay informed
ttof all the latest events.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttI admire that in a person. As for
ttmyself, I find there is so much to
ttassimilate that it can become quite
ttmuddling at times...

tChance nods, changes the channel, watches a Mighty Mouse
tcartoon. Eve looks at him perplexed, then takes it for a joke
tand smiles.

<b>tEXT. RAND MANSION - NIGHT
</b>
tTwo uniformed valets, WILSON and PERKINS, await the
tlimousines by the front door of the Rand mansion. Wilson
tstands behind a wheelchair. As the limo parks, Perkins and
tJeffrey assist Chance into the chair. Wilson turns to Eve as
tshe gets out of the limo.

<b>ttttWILSON 
</b>ttGood evening, Mrs. Rand.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttGood evening, Wilson.

<b>ttttWILSON 
</b>ttI shall take the gentleman to the

ttAllenby is standing by.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttThank you, Wilson. That will be

tPerkins and Jeffrey carry Chance in the chair up the steps
tand into the house. Eve and Wilson follow.

<b>tINT. RAND MANSION - FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT

tOnce inside the house, Wilson takes over wheeling Chance. A
tlady, GRETA, is waiting to take Eve's coat.

<b>ttttEVE

ttI'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm

ttYes, I think he should examine my

tEve watches as Wilson wheels Chance around a corner.

<b>tINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
tThe doors open, Wilson pushes Chance into the elevator. As
tWilson pushes a button and the doors close on them, a strange
tlook comes over Chance's face.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(looks to Wilson)
tt... I've never been in one of
ttthese.

tWilson thinks that Chance is talking about the wheelchair.

<b>ttttWILSON
</b>ttIt's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's
ttbeen ill...

tChance looks around the elevator.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttDoes it have a television?

<b>ttttWILSON 
</b>ttt(laughs)
ttNo - but Mr. Rand does have one
ttwith an electric motor, that way he
ttcan get around by himself.

<b>ttttCHANCE

tChance again checks out the elevator.

<b>ttttCHANCE (CONT'D)
</b>ttHow long do we stay in here?

<b>ttttWILSON 
</b>ttHow long? I don't know, see what

tThe elevator stops on the third floor.

tA hallway adjoining a large, glass-enclosed room. Eve passes
tthrough the hall, enters the room.

<b>tINT. BENJAMIN RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tEve enters into a hermetically sealed area, set up with all
tthe latest hospital emergency gear; oxygen, EKG machine, X
tray machine, transfusion equipment, sterilizers, etc.
tBENJAMIN RAND, wearing a silk bathrobe, lies in a king-sized
tbed in the center of the room. A nurse, CONSTANCE, is
tattending to her duties in the room, looks up as Eve comes
tin.

<b>ttttCONSTANCE 
</b>ttGood evening, Mrs. Rand.

<b>tEVE 
</b>
tGood evening, Constance.

tBen Rand perks up as he sees Eve crossing to him. He is in
this sixties, maintains an inner strength and dignity despite
tthe sapping effects of his illness.

<b>ttttRAND
</b>tt(with weakness) 
tt... Eve...

tEve kisses him, holds his hand.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttOh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttTired... And I'm getting tired of

ttgo through all that.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttOh, it wasn't all that bad,

ttreasonable.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttReasonable? Good, I'd like to meet

ttDo you feel well enough for that?

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttt(smiles)
ttHah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if

tThere is silence from Eve. Rand squeezes her hand, turns to
tConstance.

<b>tINT. EAST WING GUEST SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
tAn enormous bedroom, filled with 18th Century antique
tfurniture. DR. ROBERT ALLENBY dabs Chance's ass with a piece
tof cotton soaked in alcohol, prior to an injection. Chance
tstands with his pants to the floor, looks to the television
twhich is not turned on.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttThe injection will ease the pain
ttand swelling, Mr. Gardiner.

<b>ttttCHANCE

</b>ttYou were wrong, it did hurt.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttt(a chuckle)
ttBut not for long...

tAs Allenby puts a band-aid on Chance's ass, Chance spots a

tout, picks it up.

<b>ttttALLENBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt's good that there was no

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. I think so, too.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttHowever, with injuries such as

ttlooked after.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI see.

tChance turns on the TV.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttt(a look to the TV, then to
ttttChance)
ttYou can pull your trousers up, now.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttOh, fine. 

<b>ttttALLENBY
</b>ttt(as Chance pulls up pants)
ttJust to take the proper
ttprecautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd
ttrecommend we take you downstairs
ttand X-ray your leg.
ttt(no reaction from Chance,
ttttAllenby takes a long look
ttttat him)
tt... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I
ttwould like to ask you something
ttstraight out.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(doesn't understand)
tt... Straight out?

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttYes. Are you planning on making any
ttsort of claim against the Rand's?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(after a beat)
ttClaim...? ... Oh, claim, that's
ttwhat Thomas asked me.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttThomas? Who's Thomas?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttThomas Franklin, an attorney.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttAn attorney?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(turns back to TV)
ttYes.

<b>ttttALLENBY
</b>ttt(suddenly very cold)
ttThen you wish to handle this matter
ttthrough your attorneys?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttThere's no need for a claim, the
ttgarden is a healthy one.

<b>ttttALLENBY
</b>ttt(gives Chance a look)
ttOh, I see...
ttt(warms up)
tt... Well, then... You're a very
ttfunny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught
ttme off guard, I must admit...

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(changes channels, sits on
ttttbed)
ttThank you.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttGood, keep your weight off that
ttleg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it
ttwould be best if you could stay
tthere for a day or two, if that
ttwould be would be possible. Since
ttBenjamin became ill we have our own
tthospital downstairs. I can promise
ttyou the finest in care, unless, of
ttcourse, you would prefer to go
ttelsewhere.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, I could stay here. Thank you.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttFine. Would you like me to speak to
ttyour personal physician?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo.

tAllenby waits for Chance to say more, he does not. Finally,
tAllenby picks up his bag, heads for the door.

<b>ttttALLENBY
</b>ttt(stops by door)
ttI'll send Wilson up to take you for
ttX-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to
ttuse the telephone, and please let
ttme know if you have any discomfort.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(clicking changer)
ttYes, I will.

tAllenby gives him a look, then leaves. Chance watches an old
tmovie of a man lighting a cigar. The man enjoys the cigar,
tblows out smoke. The scene seems to 'sink into' Chance's
tmind.

<b>tEXT. MANSION - PATIO - NIGHT
</b>
tEve sits next to a roaring patio fireplace with a steaming
tcup of tea. Allenby comes outside, joins her.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttGood God, Eve - you'll freeze out
tthere.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttI wanted some fresh air, Robert.
ttHow is Mr. Gardiner?

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttA rather large contusion, but I
ttdon't feel there is any serious
ttdamage. I'd like to keep an eye on
tthim, though - I suggested that he
ttstay here for a couple of days.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttStay here? Is that necessary?

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttNot necessary, but preferable. I
ttdon't think he'll be a bother, he
ttseems like a most refreshing sort
ttof man.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttYes, he is different... Not the
ttkind of person one usually meets in
ttWashington.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttHow true. Mr. Gardiner may be a
ttwelcome change of pace.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttHe's very intense, and internal,
ttdon't you think?

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttAt times, yes. But that's not an
ttuncommon reaction to such an
ttaccident. Actually, I found him to
tthave quite a sense of humor.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttGood. It might be pleasant for a
ttcouple of days. 
ttt(Eve puts down her tea)
tt... Robert... Is there any
ttimprovement...?

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttNo, Eve... I'm sorry.

tEve is silent for a moment, looks out to the darkness.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>tt... Sometimes when I see Ben I
ttcould swear that he's getting
ttstronger... Something that he might
ttsay, the way he moves, or a look in
tthis eyes - makes me feel that this
ttis all a nightmare and that he'll
ttbe better soon... It's just so hard
ttto believe what's really
tthappening...

tAllenby reaches out, holds Eve's hand.

<b>tINT. RAND MANSION - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tThe elevator door opens, Wilson guides Chance in the
twheelchair into the hallway.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(looks back to elevator)
tt... That is a very small room.

<b>ttttWILSON 
</b>ttt(laughs)
ttYes sir, I guess that's true
ttsmallest room in the house.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(glancing around)
ttYes. It seems to be.

tWilson takes this as another joke, chuckles as he wheels
tChance toward Rand's hospital room.

<b>tINT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tCONSTANCE and another nurse, TERESA, stand by as Rand is
tbeing given a transfusion. Rand lifts his head as Wilson
twheels Chance into the room.

<b>ttttRAND
</b>ttWelcome to Rand Memorial Hospital,
ttMr. Gardiner.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(looks around room)
tt... I see.

tWilson pushes Chance to the X-Ray machine, where the
ttechnician, BILLINGS, a Black man, waits. As Wilson and
tBillings help Chance onto the X-Ray table, Chance's face
tbrightens up.

<b>ttttCHANCE (CONT'D)
</b>ttI feel very good in here.

<b>ttttRAND
</b>ttSure you do. This ward is air
tttight, I have a little extra oxygen
ttpumped in, keeps my spirits up.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttYes. I like that very much.

<b>ttttBILLINGS
</b>ttt(lining up Chance's leg)
ttThis won't take long, Mr. Gardiner.
ttPlease hold still when I ask.

tChance stares at Billings, reacts to him being Black.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(to Billings)
ttDo you know Raphael?

<b>ttttBILLINGS
</b>ttNo sir, I don't believe I do.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttOh. I have a message for him.

<b>ttttBILLINGS
</b>ttYes, sir.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttA Black man gave me the message.

<b>ttttBILLINGS 
</b>ttWell, I still don't believe I know
ttthe man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold
ttstill.

tRand looks over as Billings takes the X-Ray.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttAplastic anemia, Mr. Gardiner -
ttaplastic anemia.

tChance smiles to Rand.

<b>ttttRAND (CONT'D)
</b>ttFailure of the bone marrow to
ttproduce red blood cells... Not a
ttdamn thing they can do about it.
ttOh, they can make me comfortable,
ttprolong my life with steroid
tttherapy and transfusions... And
ttwhat makes my blood boil, what
ttlittle I have left, that is, Mr.
ttGardiner - is that it's generally a
ttyoung person's disease... Here I
ttam, getting on in years and about
ttto die of a young person's
ttdisease...

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(still smiles at Rand)
ttYes. You look very sick.

<b>ttttBILLINGS 
</b>ttHold still, please, Mr. Gardiner.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttt(a laugh)
ttI am very sick, and, as you can see
ttby all this paraphernalia, I am
ttvery wealthy. I think I would
ttrather be wealthy and sick than
ttpoor and sick.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(looks around the room)
ttI understand. I've never seen
ttanything like this on television.

<b>ttttBILLINGS 
</b>ttPlease, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.

<b>ttttCONSTANCE 
</b>ttYou too, Mr. Rand, you must stay
ttquiet.

tRand lays his head back.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>tt... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner -
ttwe're prisoners of tubes and
tttechnology.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI agree.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttt(flat on his back)
tt... You will join us for dinner,
ttwon't you, Mr. Gardiner?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(also flat on his back)
ttYes. I am very hungry.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>tt... So am I, my boy - so am I.

<b>tINT. RAND DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tTHURMAND, a waiter, and MARIANNE, a waitress, enter into the
tRand dining room carrying trays of food. The dining room is
timmense, a 70-foot ceiling, huge fireplace. Allenby, Eve,
tRand, and Chance (both in wheelchairs) sit around the table.
tRand speaks slowly, with obvious weakness.

<b>ttttRAND
</b>ttI know exactly what you mean. Today
ttthe businessman is at the mercy of
ttkid-lawyers from the SEC. All they
ttwant to do is regulate our natural
ttgrowth! It's happening across the
ttcountry!

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttTo everyone, I'm afraid. The
ttGovernment controls are so
ttrestricting that the Medical
ttProfession, as we know it, is being
ttlegislated out of existence.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttOf course! By kid-lawyers!

tEve turns to Chance.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttWon't your injury prevent you from
ttattending to business, Mr.
ttGardiner?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo. It won't do that.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>tt... Would you like us to notify
ttanyone for you?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo. The Old Man died and Louise
ttleft.

tThere is a moment of silence.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttOh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you
tthave any need for any of our
ttfacilities, please do not hesitate
ttto ask.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttDo you need a secretary?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo, thank you. My house has been
ttclosed.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttOh. When you say 'Your house has
ttbeen closed', you mean to say that
ttyour business was shut down?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. Shut down and locked by the
ttattorneys.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttWhat'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The
ttS.E.C.! Damn them!

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttI hope that staying here won't be
ttan inconvenience for you.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo. I like it here.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttThat's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I
ttcall you Chauncey?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(agreeable to being called
ttttChauncey)
ttYes. Chauncey is fine.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttAnd I'm Ben.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttt(smiles to Chance)
tt... And please call me Robert.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, Robert. I will.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttSo tell me, Chauncey, what are your
ttplans now?

tChance looks around the room. 

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttDoes this house have a garden?

tAllenby gives Chance a look.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttDo we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow,
ttChauncey, you will see our gardens.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI see. I would like to work in your
ttgarden.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttt(laughs)
ttOh, I know exactly what you mean. I
ttsometimes enjoy puttering around
ttmyself, such a pleasant way to
ttforget one's troubles.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI am a very good gardener.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttA gardener! Well put, Chauncey
ttexcellent! Isn't that what a
ttbusinessman is? A gardener? A
ttperson that makes flinty soil
ttproductive with the labor of his
ttown hands, who waters it with the
ttsweat from his own brow, and who
ttcreates a place of value for his
ttfamily and community? Yes,
ttChauncey, what a brilliant metaphor
tt-- yes, indeed, a productive
ttbusinessman is a laborer in his own
ttvineyard.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttThank you, Ben. The garden that I
ttleft was such a place. Everything
ttwhich grew there was with the labor
ttof my own hands. I planted seeds
ttand watered them and watched
tteverything grow.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttt(weakly)
ttBravo!

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttBut I don't have that any more...
ttt(points to ceiling)
tt... All that's left for me now is
ttthe room upstairs.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttNow, wait a minute, Chauncey you
ttare young, you are healthy, for
ttGod's sake don't give up on
ttyourself! You have to fight! You
ttcan't let those bastards keep you
ttdown! I don't want to hear any more
ttfrom you about the 'Room Upstairs'.
ttThat's where I'm going soon.

tThere is a long pause. Chance looks up, then smiles at Rand.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttIt's a very pleasant room, Ben.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttt(laughs)
ttYes, I'm sure it is. That's what
ttthey say, anyway.

tAnother period of silence. The servants bustle around the
troom as Allenby studies Chance.

<b>tINT. RAND'S POOL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tAllenby opens the door. Rand enters in his electric
twheelchair followed by Chance being pushed by Wilson.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>tt... I don't know what you've heard
ttabout me, Chauncey, but I'm sure
ttyou know everything there is to
ttknow. Cigar?

tRand holds out humidor to Chance.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, thank you.
ttt(takes cigar)
ttNo Ben. I don't know everything
ttabout you.

tRand smiles as he takes a cigar for himself.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>tt... No, of course you don't. Excuse
ttme for being so presumptuous. No
ttman knows everything about another
ttman - however, very few are honest
ttenough to admit it.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttThat is so true. You're different,
ttChauncey... Quite different than
ttmost men.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttThank you, Robert.

tRand lights his own cigar, then hands an ornate lighter to
tChance.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttt(picks up pool cue, weakly
ttttstrokes the balls)
tt... You know, Chauncey, there are
ttthousands of American businessmen,
ttlarge and small, that share your
ttplight. I've been concerned with
ttthe situation for some time now.

tChance, not knowing to bite off the tip, tries to light the
tcigar like the man on TV. It will not light.

<b>ttttRAND (CONT'D)
</b>ttSo I've been thinking about
ttbeginning a financial assistance
ttprogram, Chauncey, to help out
ttAmerican businessmen that have been
ttharassed by inflation, excessive
tttaxation, unions and other
ttindecencies...

tAllenby watches Chance trying to light the cigar as Rand
tspeaks on, shooting pool as he talks.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>tt... I'd like to offer the decent
tt'Gardeners' of the business
ttcommunity a helping hand. After
ttall, they are our strongest defense
ttagainst the pollutants who so
ttthreaten our basic freedoms and the
ttwell-being of our middle class.
ttTell me, would you have any
ttthoughts on such a program?

tChance puts the unlit cigar in the ashtray, smiles at
tAllenby, then answers Rand.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo, Ben.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttt(a smile)
ttReluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey?
ttWell, I can understand that. When a
ttman loses everything, anger has a
tttendency to block out reason for a
tttime. Just give it some thought,
ttwork with the idea, I'm sure you'll
tthave plenty to say in a few days.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI could give it some thought, Ben,
ttbut my leg is very sore.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>tt... Oh?
ttt(looks to Allenby)
ttRobert, take a look, would you?

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttSome pain is to be expected... 
ttt(bends to Chance, looks at
ttttleg)
tt... And I think what would be best
ttfor the two of you is a good
ttnight's rest. 
ttt(checks watch)
tt... It's late, I'm afraid it's time
ttfor my patients to prepare for bed.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttt(puts down pool cue)
ttWe have common foes, Chauncey - kid
ttlawyers and our physician!

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI agree.

tAllenby laughs as he takes Rand's cigar from him, snuffs it
tin the ashtray.

<b>tINT. MANSION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
tWilson stands behind Chance in the wheelchair. Chance glances
tslowly and inquisitively around the elevator. When his eyes
tmeet Wilson's, the valet breaks out in laughter.

<b>ttttWILSON
</b>ttt(laughing, trying to
ttttapologize) 
tt... Sorry, sir - I just couldn't
ttcontain myself... I knew you were
ttgoing to come out with another one
ttof your jests about the elevator...
ttExcuse me, sir...

tThe elevator stops, the door opens.

<b>tINT. MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

tWilson wheels Chance out of the elevator.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(looks back as the door
ttttcloses)
tt... Hmmm... Elevator.

<b>ttttWILSON
</b>ttt(laughs again)
tt... Yes sir - elevator!

tWilson stops laughing, becomes the stone-faced servant once
tagain as he notices Eve coming out of her bedroom. Wilson
tstops wheeling Chance, stands stiffly at attention as Eve and
tChance talk.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttChauncey, I wanted to tell you how
ttdreadful I feel about the accident
tttoday, but that I'm delighted that
ttyou are staying with us.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttThank you, Eve - I like this house
ttvery much.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>tt... And Ben is just mad about you -
ttyou've lifted his spirits so - it's
ttjust... Well, it's just a real
ttpleasure having you with us.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttBen is very ill, Eve - I've seen
ttthat before.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttYes... I know, Chauncey.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI like Ben very much... He reminds
ttme of the Old Man...

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttHe does...?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. Are you going to leave and
ttclose the house when he dies?

tEve is not prepared for such a question.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>tt... Why... No, I don't think so...

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttThat's good.

tChance smiles at Eve and there is a moment of silence before
tEve steps back into her bedroom.

<b>ttttEVE
</b>tt... Good night, Chauncey.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttGood night, Eve.

tEve closes the door. Wilson wheels Chance down the hallway
ttoward the guest room.

<b>tEXT. FRONT OF RAND MANSION - MORNING
</b>
tEve comes out of the house, Jeffrey holds the door for her as
tshe gets into "RAND l." Jeffrey gets in and the limo pulls
taway. Chance comes out of the front door, walking with a
tlimp. His first view of the Rand grounds in the daylight, he
tis taken by the extent of the greenery. An attendant, LEWIS,
thurries to Chance.

<b>ttttLEWIS 
</b>ttDid you want a car, sir?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. I would like a car.

<b>ttttLEWIS 
</b>ttYes, sir.

tLewis goes to his post, picks up a phone. As Chance looks at
tthe surroundings, Allenby and Wilson, with Chance's
twheelchair, come out of the house.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttt(frowns as he sees Chance
ttttwalking)
ttChauncey, there you are. What are
ttyou doing on that leg?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttIt's fine today, Robert.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttShame on you, Chauncey - you should
ttlet me be the judge of that.
ttt(motions to Wilson)
ttPlease, sit in the chair.

tWilson pushes the wheelchair to Chance, he sits.

<b>ttttALLENBY (CONT'D)

ttI swear, Chauncey, between you and
ttBenjamin, I've got my hands full...

ttconsiderably...
ttt(pokes a spot)
tt... Any pain here?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, Robert. But it's not bad.

tA limousine pulls up to the front of the mansion, waits for
tChance.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttt(continues examining)
tt... Benjamin has been hounding me
ttto allow him to address the annual
ttmeeting of his Financial Institute
tttoday, but obviously, the strain
ttwould be impossible... How about
tthere, Chauncey, any soreness?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttHardly any, Robert.

tLewis, the attendant, interrupts.

<b>ttttLEWIS 
</b>ttYour limousine, sir.

</b>ttNo, Robert.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, Robert. I know about the
ttPresident.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttt(mildly surprised)
tt... Oh? You've heard?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. Ben called me. He wants me to
ttmeet the President.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttt(stands)
ttHe does, does he?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, Ben told me to be in his room
ttat ten o'clock.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttWhy, that's terrific, Chauncey.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttHow do I know when it's ten
tto'clock?

tA long look from Allenby, then he looks at his watch.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>tt... It's five of, you'd best get on
ttin there.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttThank you, Robert.

tWilson begins to push Chance.

</b>ttHell yes - walk. You're meeting the
ttPresident, aren't you?

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(gets out of chair)
ttOh, really?

tAllenby, a bit puzzled, watches as Chance goes into the
thouse.

<b>tINT. RAND MANSION - HALLWAY - MORNING
</b>
tChance limps aimlessly through a hallway. He stops, admires a
tlarge tapestry on the wall. A servant, SMYTHE, notices Chance
tappears confused, approaches him.

<b>ttttSMYTHE
</b>ttMay I help you, Mr. Gardiner?

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(with a smile)
ttYes. I would like to go to Rand
ttMemorial Hospital.

<b>ttttSMYTHE
</b>ttt(a pause)
tt... Sir?

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttYes.

tThere is another long pause.

<b>ttttSMYTHE
</b>tt... Did you wish to see someone,

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttYes, I would like to see Ben.

<b>ttttSMYTHE
</b>ttOh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this
ttway, sir.

tChance follows Smythe down the hall.

<b>tINT. RAND'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
</b>
tRand is in an easy chair, dressed for his meeting with the
tPresident. The two nurses are working at the disinfecting
ttable. Rand smiles as Chance is shown into the room by
tSmythe.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttChauncey, up and around this
ttmorning, are you?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.

</b>ttYou're looking much better today,
ttBen.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttHah! It's all make-up, Chauncey...
ttI asked nurse Teresa to fix me up,
ttI didn't want the President to
ttthink I was going to die during our
tttalk.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttI understand.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttNo one likes a dying man, my boy -

</b>ttYes, when I was younger I had
ttthoughts about public office... But
ttI found, Chauncey - that I was able
ttto contribute more as a private
ttcitizen... of course, my wealth
ttprovided me with considerable
ttinfluence, but I've tried, believe
ttme, not to misuse that power...
ttIt's extremely important, Chauncey,
ttwhen one is in a position of
tteminence, that he does not allow
tthimself to become blinded to the
ttneeds of the country... The
tttemptations are strong, and I've

tThere is a beat as the President looks at Chance quizzically,
tthen he continues.

</b>ttI just wondered if you had gone
ttover my speech, Ben.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttYes, I did.

</b>tt... Well?

</b>ttOverall - pretty good. But, Mr.

</b>ttWell, Ben... I...

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttI sympathize with your position,
ttMr. President, I know how difficult

tthen moves in.

</b>
tAllenby is searching through Chancels clothes looking for
tsome sort of identification. There is a knock at the door,

</b>ttOh... Hello.

tPerkins watches curiously as Riff passes the metal detector
tover Allenby's clothing.

<b>tINT. LIBRARY - MORNING
</b>
tThe President is worried about what Rand is telling him. He
tpaces, smokes a cigarette. Chance smiles through it all.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>tt... There is no longer any margin
ttfor inflation, it has gone as far
ttas it can, you've reached your
ttlimits on taxation, dependence on
ttforeign energy has reached a
ttcrisis, and, from where I see it,
ttMr. President, the Free Enterprise
ttSystem has reached the breaking
ttpoint. We are on the brink of
ttanother crash from which recovery
ttmight not be possible.

<b>ttttPRESIDENT 
</b>ttIt's that serious, huh?

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttI'm afraid so.

tThe President now looks nearly as bad as Rand. He sits, turns
tto Chance.

</b>ttDo you agree with Ben, Mr.
ttGardiner? Are we finished? Or do
ttyou think we can stimulate growth
ttthrough temporary incentives?

ttAs long as the roots are not
ttsevered, all is well and all will
ttbe well in the garden.

</b>ttt(a pause)
tt... In the garden?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttThat is correct. In a garden,
ttgrowth has its season. There is

ttalso fall and winter. And then
ttspring and summer again...

<b>ttttPRESIDENT 
</b>ttt(staring at Chance)
tt... Spring and summer...
ttt(confused)
ttYes, I see... Fall and winter.
ttt(smiles at Chance)
ttYes, indeed...
ttt(a beat)
ttCould you go through that one more
tttime, please, Mr. Gardiner?

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttI think what my most insightful
ttfriend is saying, Mr. President, is
ttthat we welcome the inevitable
ttseasons of nature, yet we are upset
ttby the seasons of our economy.

</b>ttYes. That is correct.

<b>ttttPRESIDENT 
</b>ttt(pleased)
tt...Well, Mr. Gardiner, I must
ttadmit, that is one of the most
ttrefreshing and optimistic
ttstatements I've heard in a very,

tThe President puts out his cigarette, rises.

<b>ttttPRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>tt... Many of us forget that nature
ttand society are one! Yes, though we
tthave tried to cut ourselves off
ttfrom nature, we are still a part of
ttit! Like nature, our economic
ttsystem remains, in the long run,

ttt(he smiles at Chance, who

ttI must be going. 
ttt(holds out hand to Chance)
ttMr. Gardiner, this visit has been
ttenlightening...

tChance rises and shakes the President's hand.

</b>ttNow, Ben, I won't have any of that.
ttWhy don't you listen to your good

ttHe's a decent fellow, the
ttPresident, isn't he?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, Ben - he is.

</b>ttHe was quite impressed with your

ttAnd, please, Chauncey - don't rush

tChance, with a limp, walks down a pathway in the garden,
tadmires the greenery. In the background, coming from the

</b>ttFine. He's very nice.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttYes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get

tt... Mentor...?

tEve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the Old
tMan.

</b>ttForgive me, Chauncey - I didn't
ttmean to pry. You must have been
ttvery close to him.

<b>ttttCHANCE

ttt(getting more to the
ttttpoint)
tt... And what about Louise? YOU

ttOh, his maid!... Stupid me, I
ttthought perhaps she was someone
ttthat you may have been romantically
ttinvolved with.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttOh, no. She brought me my meals.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttt(pleased)
ttOf course.

tEve edges slightly closer to Chance. Chance edges slightly
tcloser to the greenhouse, is fascinated by it.

</b>ttWhat is that?

</b>ttOur greenhouse.

tRand is in bed. Eve, Chance and Allenby are seated around
thim, the two nurses standing to one side. They all watch the
tPresident's address to the Financial Institute on TV. Chance
tinhales deeply, enjoys the oxygen in the room. Rand is
tlooking weaker. Every so often, Allenby casts a concerned
tglance his way.

<b>ttttPRESIDENT'S VOICE 
</b>tt... And there are so many of you

ttthe brink of the worst financial
ttcrisis in this nation's history.
ttAnd there are so many of you
ttdemanding that we put into effect
ttdrastic measures to alter its

tRand perks up a bit at this mention. Allenby manages a smile,
tonce again looks at Rand, checking his condition. Eve looks
tproudly at Chance, who continues to enjoy the oxygen.

tCourtney doesn't understand but continues his questioning.

</b>ttI see. Then one more quick
ttquestion, Mr. Gardiner; since we at

ttis your business?

</b>ttI have nothing more to say.

tChance hangs up the phone, watches the TVs.

tCourtney listens to the dial tone, then puts the receiver
tdown.

ttTypical - no wonder he's so close

</b>ttt(surprised to see him)
ttWhy, hello, Mr. Gardiner - are you

</b>
tMrs. Aubrey is at her desk, buzzing her inter-house phone. As

</b>ttI can't find Mr. Gardiner anywhere.

</b>ttHe's in the basement.

tKINNEY, a research assistant, sits behind a stack of
tpaperwork, has a downcast expression as he listens to
tCourtney.

<b>ttttCOURTNEY 
</b>tt... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of

tta strong candidate for one of the

<b>tINT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
tChance is intrigued by the surroundings as Hull guides him
tthrough the corridor.

<b>ttttHULL 
</b>ttOf course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact

tHull takes Chance into the MAKE-UP room.

<b>tINT. RAND MANSION - CHANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tConstance is in the closet, searching through Chance's
tpockets, finding nothing. She takes out a small knife, cuts a
tlabel from one of the jackets. Quickly, she examines one of
tChance's shoes, copies the name of the shoemaker in a
tnotebook. Constance hurries to the dresser, continues her
tsearch.

<b>tINT. TV STATION - CORRIDOR/MAKEUP ROOM  NIGHT

tCOLSON, the makeup man, comes through the corridor carrying a
tglass of water. He turns into the makeup room, goes to Chance
twho sits in front of the lights. Hull sits next to Chance,
tbriefs him on the show. Chance has his eyes on a TV monitor,
twatches the guest preceding him on "This Evening."

ttHere you go, Mr. Gardiner.

ttOkay, Mr. Gardiner, you're all set.

tThe BAND plays as Chance comes onto the stage. An audience of

tcameras move with him as he walks, with a smile and a limp,
tto center stage. Dupont shakes Chance's hand, Chance holds
tDupont's hand with both of his own.

</b>ttt(also sitting)
ttI always find it surprising, Mr.

ttI hope so.

</b>ttNo. I don't object.

<b>ttttDUPONT

ttwould like to know if you agree
ttwith the President's view of the
tteconomy?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttWhich view?

tApplause and laughter from the audience. Dupont accustomed to
tparrying with his guests, asks again.

<b>ttttDUPONT 
</b>ttCome now, Mr. Gardiner, before his
ttspeech at the Financial Institute
ttthe President consulted with you
ttand Benjamin Rand, did he not?

<b>ttttCHANCE

<b>ttttDUPONT 
</b>ttI know that, Mr. Gardiner.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttDUPONT
</b>ttt(a beat)
ttWell, let me rephrase the question;
ttthe President compared the economy
ttof this country to a garden, and
ttstated that after a period of
ttdecline a time of growth would
ttnaturally follow. Do you go along
ttwith this belief?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, I know the garden very well. I
tthave worked in it all my life. It
ttis a good garden and a healthy one;
ttits trees are healthy and so are
ttits shrubs and flowers, as long as
ttthey are trimmed and watered in the
ttright seasons. The garden needs a
ttlot of care. I do agree with the
ttPresident; everything in it will
ttgrow strong, and there is plenty of
ttroom in it for new trees and new
ttflowers of all kinds.

tThe audience applauds Chance's apparent metaphor. Dupont
twaits for it all to subside, then asks another question.

tRand's hand in excitement as they both watch Chance on
ttelevision. Teresa, the nurse, watches in the background.

</b>ttt(over TV)
tt...Well, Mr. Gardiner, that was

tAt the end of the question, Dupont glances over Chance's
tshoulder to look at the monitor.

</b>ttt(a beat)
ttI understand.

tChance turns to see what Dupont is looking at, sees the back
tof his own head on the TV screen.

<b>ttttDUPONT 
</b>ttI realize that might be a difficult
ttquestion for you, Mr. Gardiner -
ttbut there are a lot of us around

ttand the other side to be dry...

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(over TV)
tt... It is the gardener's
ttresponsibility to take water from
ttthe flooded area and run it to the
ttarea that is dry. It is the

tFranklin's voice fades into the background hubbub. The voice

ttthat, my boy, is a rare talent, the

ttGood morning, sir.

tThe President leads the way into the Oval Office.

tA quick "Yes sir" from Miss Davis over the intercom. The

</b>
tChance is in bed, a bed tray on his lap, eating breakfast. A
tpile of the morning's newspapers lies at the foot of the bed,
tuntouched. The TV is playing, Chance watches as he eats.
tThere is a knock at the door. 

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(without turning from TV)
ttCome in!

tEve enters, wearing a robe over her nightgown.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttChauncey! Have you seen the papers?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttNo, Eve. I don't read the papers.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttt(moving to bed)
ttWell, it seems you've been
ttdescribed as one of the architects
ttof the President's speech. And your
ttown comments from the 'This

ttside with the President's.

</b>ttI like the President. He is a very
ttnice man.

ttt(with difficulty)
ttI want us... You and I to become...
ttclose... I want us to become very
ttclose, you know...?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, Eve. I know that.

tEve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first, then
tlosing control, the tears flowing freely. To comfort her,
tChance puts his arm around her shoulder, nearly tipping his
tbreakfast tray. Eve responds to his touch, draws closer,
tholds Chance tightly. Chance does his best to avoid spilling
this breakfast, keep an eye on the TV, and to comfort Eve. She
tgives in to her desires, begins to caress Chance, running her
thand over his body. She kisses him, his eyes, his neck, his
tlips, his ears. Chance does not return the lovemaking, and
tEve eventually catches hold of herself, stops. She lies
tquietly beside Chance for a time, regains her demeanor, then
tspeaks.

<b>ttttEVE
</b>tt... I'm grateful to you,
ttChauncey... I would have opened to
ttyou with a touch, and you know
ttthat...

tEve cannot bring herself to finish the sentence. She rises,
tstraightens her robe and moves toward the door.

<b>ttttEVE (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(stopping by door)
tt... I do love you, Chauncey.

tA knock at the door startles Eve. She turns, opens it to
tMAGGIE, the seam tress. Maggie carries one of Rand's tuxedos.

<b>ttttEVE (CONT'D)
</b>ttOh, come in, Maggie.

ttYes, ma'am.

</b>ttBut... Where was this man Gardiner
ttbefore last week?

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttt(reaches out to him)
ttLet me feel the strength in your
tthand, Chauncey... Let me feel your
ttstrength...
ttt(holds Chance's hand)
ttYes, that's good... I hope,
ttChauncey - I hope that you'll stay
ttwith Eve... Take care of her, watch
ttover her, she's a delicate flower,
ttChauncey...

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttA flower...

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>ttShe cares for you and she needs
ttyour help, Chauncey... there's much
ttto be looked after...

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. I would like to do that.

<b>ttttRAND 
</b>tt... I've worked very hard and
ttenjoyed my life... I've known
ttsuccess... and I've felt love... My
ttassociates, Chauncey - I've talked
ttwith them about you... They're
tteager to meet you... very eager to
ttmeet you... I'm very fond of you,
ttChauncey... And I understand Eve...
ttTell her that... tell her I'm madly
ttin love with her...

tRand slumps down, dead. Allenby checks his pulse, turns to
tChance.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>tt... He's gone, Chauncey.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes, Robert. I have seen it before.
ttIt happens to old people.

<b>ttttALLENBY
</b>ttt(covers Rand's face)
ttYes, I suppose that's true.

tChance reaches out, uncovers Rand's face, gently touches the
tman's forehead, feels the coldness. Allenby eyes him as
tChance stays with Rand for a moment, then replaces the sheet.

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(turns to Allenby)
ttWill you be leaving now, Robert?

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttIn a day or two, yes.

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttEve is going to stay. The house
ttwill not be closed.

<b>ttttALLENBY
</b>ttt(a moment, a look)
tt... You've become quite a close
ttfriend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...
ttt(a beat)
tt... Chance...?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. I love Eve very much.

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttI see...
ttt(another beat)
tt... And you are really a gardener,
ttaren't you?

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttt(brightens)
ttYes, Robert - I am.
ttt(a smile at Allenby)
ttI'll go tell Eve about Ben now,
ttRobert.

tChance leaves the bedroom. Allenby watches him go, then sits
tback in a chair, his head spinning.

<b>tEXT. RAND MANSION - DAY
</b>
tA cloudy, cold day patches of snow are on the ground. The
tRand servants are lined up in front of the mansion, listen to
tfuneral services for Rand on a pair of loudspeakers. PAN
tAROUND, reveal the services being held on a hill overlooking
tthe mansion. Fifty mourners are gathered around the Rand
tfamily mausoleum. Chance stands with Eve and Allenby. The
tPresident of the United States stands before a microphone.

<b>ttttPRESIDENT 
</b>tt... Millions of people across the
ttworld have heard of the passing of
ttBenjamin Rand; but, unfortunately,
ttonly relatively few will feel the
ttpain and sadness at such a loss. To
ttmost, Benjamin Rand was a legend;
ttto those of us gathered here today,
ttBenjamin was a beloved friend. My
ttpersonal association with Benjamin
ttdates back many years, and my
ttmemories of our friendship will
ttstay with me forever.

tAs the President speaks, Chance turns and walks away. Eve and
tAllenby watch as he goes into the trees surrounding the area.

<b>ttttPRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttI initially came in contact with
ttthe Rand name in 1943. 1 was a
ttyoung lieutenant in the Air Corps,
tta navigator flying missions over
ttEurope. That plane that I learned
ttto know so well was manufactured by
ttthe Rand Aeronautics Corporation.
ttt(a beat)
ttBenjamin Rand was an industrial
ttgiant, known to be powerful and
ttuncompromising, and yet, on a
ttpersonal level, we have all felt
tthis warmth and humor...
ttt(a beat)
tt... I would like to share with you
tta few quotes, and a few feelings
ttfrom our dear friend.
ttt(holds up paper, reads)
tt... 'I do not regret having
ttpolitical differences with men that
ttI respect; I do regret, however,
ttthat our philosophies kept us
ttapart.'
tt... 'I have no use for those on
ttwelfare, no patience whatsoever...
ttBut, if I am to be honest with
ttmyself, I must admit that they have
ttno use for me, either.'
tt... 'I was born into a position of
ttextreme wealth, I have spent many
ttsleepless nights thinking about
ttextreme poverty -  I do not know
ttthe feelings of being poor, and
ttthat is not to know the feelings of
ttthe majority of people in this
ttworld. For a man in my position,
ttthat is inexcusable.' 
tt'Life is a state of mind.'
tt... 'When I was a boy, I was told
ttthat the Lord fashioned us from his
ttown image. That's when I decided to
ttmanufacture mirrors.'

<b>tINT. LARGE AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
tAh auditorium with row upon row of empty seats. Huddled
ttogether at one end of the hall are six important
tbusinessmen, speaking in hushed tones. JAMES DUDLEY, a
tpowerful industrialist, speaks.

<b>ttttDUDLEY 
</b>ttBut what do we know of the man?
ttNothing! We have no inkling of his
ttpast!

tSEWELL NELSON, a corporation chairman, joins in.

<b>ttttNELSON 
</b>ttCorrect, and that is an asset. A
ttman's past can cripple him, his
ttbackground turns into a swamp and
ttinvites scrutiny.

tAnother executive, PETER CALDWELL, agrees.

<b>ttttCALDWELL 
</b>ttTo this time, he hasn't said
ttanything that could be used against
tthim.

tCHARLIE BOB BENNET, a Texas oil millionaire;

<b>ttttBENNET 
</b>ttWell, I'm certainly open to the
ttthought - it would be sheer lunacy
ttto support the President for
ttanother term.

<b>ttttNELSON 
</b>ttNo one will go along with that...
ttLook at the facts, gentlemen, the
ttresponse from his appearance on
tt'This Evening' was overwhelming; he
tthas excited and awakened the people
ttof this country at a time of
ttdespair.

tLYMAN MURRAY, a banker;

<b>ttttMURRAY 
</b>ttHe's personable, elusive, yet
ttseemingly honest. He's riding a
ttcrest of popularity that builds
ttwith every statement. As far as his
ttthinking goes, he appears to be one
ttof us. I firmly believe, gentlemen,
ttthat he is our only chance - Mr.
ttChauncey Gardiner!

<b>tEXT. WOODS - DAY
</b>
tChance, his umbrella under his arm, walks through the woods.

<b>tEXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY
</b>
tThe services are over. Eve, Allenby talk with the President
tand the First Lady.

<b>ttttEVE
</b>ttIt was very moving, Bobby - thank
ttyou so much...

<b>ttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttWe're all going to miss him, Eve... 
ttt(glances around)
tt... Where's Mr. Gardiner?

<b>ttttALLENBY
</b>tt... He walked off...

<b>ttttEVE
</b>ttChauncey is so sensitive... He was
ttovercome with grief...

<b>ttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttI can certainly understand that...

<b>ttttFIRST LADY
</b>ttOf course... I'm so sorry for you,
ttEve...

<b>ttttEVE
</b>ttThank you, Nancy.

<b>ttttFIRST LADY
</b>ttI'll call you soon.

tThe President and First Lady head toward their limousine.

<b>tEXT. WOODS - DAY
</b>
tChance walks deeper into the woods, absorbed in the greenery.
tHe stops by a tree, brushes some snow from a branch, moves
ton.

<b>tEXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY
</b>
tThe majority of mourners have left. Eve and Allenby walk
tslowly to the RAND 1 limousine, look around for Chance.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>tt... Do you think we should look for
tthim?

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttI don't think so, he should be
ttalong soon...

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttI wish he were here...

tEve keeps looking as they walk to the limousine.

<b>tEXT. WOODS - DAY
</b>
tChance happens on a tree with a cracked limb, hanging to the
tground. He stops, inspects the break, runs his fingers along
tthe split in the bark. He looks to the ground, notices that
tan end of the limb has fallen on a seedling, bending it
tdouble. Chance pulls the limb away, then kneels beside the
tseedling. He removes an expensive paid of suede gloves, and,
twith gentle fingers, brushes the dirt and snow away from the
tseedling. Chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the
tlarger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree.
tHe unfolds his umbrella, places it over the seedling in a way
tto give it protection, yet to still allow it to receive light
tfrom the winter sun. Chance stands, puts his gloves back on
tand continues his walk, disappearing into a remote section of
tthe woods.

<b>tEXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY
</b>
tJeffrey stands holding the door for Eve and Allenby, all the
tother cars have gone. Eve is worried, gets into the car.

<b>tEXT. WOODS - DAY
</b>
tChance walks through the woods, his pace faster than before.

<b>tEXT. RAND'S FUNERAL - DAY
</b>
tThe limousine still waits for Chance.

<b>tINT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
</b>
tEve is deeply concerned for Chance.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttWe have to find him, Robert - he
ttcould be lost, something may have
tthappened, we can't leave him!

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttYou really care for him, don't you,
ttEve?

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttI do - we do - both of us, Ben and
ttI feel so much for Chauncey...

<b>ttttALLENBY 
</b>ttI think we'd better go look for
tthim. 
ttt(he taps on the glass
ttttpartition)
ttDavid!

tDavid starts up the limousine.

<b>tEXT. WOODS - DAY
</b>
tChance walks with determination through the woods.

<b>tINT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
</b>
tAllenby and Eve search for Chance as David drives along a
tnarrow road through the woods. Jeffrey, sitting in front,
tsuddenly calls out.

<b>ttttJEFFREY 
</b>ttLook!

tAbout 100 yards ahead of them, Chance crosses the road,
tcontinues on down a hill.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttThere he is! Chauncey!

tDavid stops the limousine at the point where Chance crossed.
tEve hurries out of the car.

<b>tEXT. SIDE OF ROAD - DAY
</b>
tChance is about twenty yards down the side of a hill. Eve
tcalls to him.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttChauncey! Chauncey!

<b>ttttCHANCE
</b>ttt(stops, looks up)
ttHello, Eve.

tEve runs, half falls as she goes down the hill.

<b>ttttEVE 
</b>ttOh, Chauncey...!

tShe gets to him, holds him tightly.

<b>ttttEVE (CONT'D)
</b>ttOh, Chauncey, darling... Where have
ttyou been? We thought we'd lost you -
ttwe've been looking all over!

<b>ttttCHANCE 
</b>ttYes. I've been looking for you,
tttoo, Eve.

tShe hugs him one more time, then she leads him back up the
thill to the waiting limousine. Allenby gets out of the car,
tgreets Chance with a handshake and an arm around the
tshoulder. Then the three get into the limousine.
