<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT
</b>
It is not a large room and jammed with tables, mostly for
four but some for six and eight. A long table of honor, for
about thirty people, has been placed upon a dais. 

Diner is over. Demi-tasses, cigars and brandy. The overall
effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility. It is
June.

The CAMERA, as it has been throughout the CREDIT TITLES, is
on the SARAH SIDDONS AWARD. It is a gold statuette, about a
foot high, of Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse. Exquisitely
framed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature altar in
the center of the table of honor. 

Over this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise VOICE of
ADDISON deWITT:

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t The Sarah Siddons Award for
t Distinguished Achievement is
t perhaps unknown to you. It has been
t spared the sensational and
t commercial publicity that attends
t such questionable "honors" as the
t Pulitzer Prize and those awards
t presented annually by the film
t society...

The CAMERA has EASED BACK to include some of the table of
honor and a distinguished gentleman with snow-white hair who
is speaking. We do not hear what he says. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t The distinguished looking gentleman
t is an extremely old actor. Being an
t actor - he will go on speaking for
t some time. It is not important what
t you hear what he says. 

The CAMERA EASES BACK some more, and CONTINUES until it
discloses a fairly COMPREHENSIVE SHOT of the room

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t However it is important that you
t know where you are, and why you are
t here. This is the dining room of
t the Sarah Siddons Society.
t The occasion is its annual banquet
t and presentation of the highest
t honor our Theater knows - the Sarah
t Siddons Award for Distinguished
t Achievement. 

A GROUP OF WAITERS are clustered near the screen masking the
entrances of the kitchen. The screens are papered with old
theatrical programs. The waiters are all aged and venerable.
They look respectfully toward the speaker. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t These hollowed walls, indeed many
t of these faces, have looked upon
t Modjeska, Ada Rehan and Minnie
t Fiske; Mansfield's voice filled the
t room, Booth breathed this air. It
t is unlikely that the windows have
t been opened since his death. 

CLOSE - THE AWARD on its altar, it shines proudly above five
or six smaller altars which surround it and which are now
empty. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t The minor awards, as you can see,
t have already been presented. Minor
t awards are for such as the writer
t and director - since their function
t is merely to construct a tower so
t that the world can applaud a light
t which flashes on top of it and no
t brighter light has ever dazzled the
t eye than Eve Harrington. Eve... but
t more of Eve, later. All about Eve,
t in fact.  

THE CAMERA MOVES TO: CLOSE - ADDISON deWITT, not young, not
unattractive, a fastidious dresser, sharp of eye and
merciless of tongue. An omnipresent cigarette holder projects
from his mouth like the sward of D'Artagnan. 

He sits back in his chair, musingly, his fingers making
little cannonballs out of bread crumbs. His narration covers
the MOVE of the CAMERA to him:

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t To those of you who do not read,
t attend the Theater, listen to
t uncensored radio programs or know
t anything of the world in which we
t live - it is perhaps necessary to
t introduce myself. My name is
t Addison deWitt.
t My native habitat is the Theater -
t in it I toil not, neither do I
t spin. I am a critic and
t commentator. I am essential to the
t Theater - as ants are to a picnic,
t as the ball weevil to a cotton
t field... 

He looks to his left. KAREN RICHARDS is lovely and thirtyish
in an unprofessional way. She is scraping bread crumbs,
spilled sugar, etc., into a pile with a spoon. Addison takes
one of her bread crumbs. She smiles absently. Addison rolls
the bread crumb into a cannonball. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t This is Karen Richards. She is the
t wife of a playwright, therefore of
t the Theater by marriage. Nothing in
t her background or breeding should
t have brought her any closer the
t stage than row E, center...

Karen continues her doodling. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t ... however, during her senior year
t in Radcliffe, Lloyd Richards
t lectured on drama. The following
t year Karen became Mrs. Lloyd
t Richards. Lloyd is the author of
t 'Footsteps on the Ceiling' - the
t play which has won for Eve
t Harrington the Sarah Siddons
t Award...

Karen absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse. A
hand reaches in to take the spoon away. Karen looks as the
CAMERA PANS with IT to MAX FABIAN. He sits at her left. He's
a sad-faced man with glasses and a look of constant
apprehension. He smiles apologetically and indicated a white
powder with he unwraps. He pantomimes that his ulcer is
snapping.   

Karen smiles back, returns to her doodling. Addison mashes a
cigarette stub, pops it out of his holder. He eyes Max. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t There are two types of theatrical
t producers. One has a great many
t wealthy friends who will risk a tax
t deductible loss. This type is
t interested in Art. 

Max drops the powder into some water, stirs it, drinks, burps
delicately and close his eyes. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t The other is one to whom each
t production mean potential ruin or
t fortune. This type is out to make a
t buck. Meet Max Fabian. He is the
t producer of the play which has won
t Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons
t Award...

Max rests fitfully. He twitches. A hand reaches into the
SCENE, removes a bottle of Scotch from before him. The CAMERA
follows the bottle to MARGO CHANNING. She sits at Max's left,
at deWitt's right. An attractive, strong face. She is
childish, adult, reasonable, unreasonable - usually one when
she should be the other, but always positive. She pours a
stiff drink.   

Addison hold out the soda bottle to her. She looks at it, and
at him, as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad. He
smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t Margo Channing is the Star of the
t Theater. She made her first stage
t appearance, at the age of four, in
t 'Midsummer Night's Dream'. She
t played a fairy and entered - quite
t unexpectedly - stark naked. She has
t been a Star ever since. 

Margo sloshes her drink around moodily, pulls at it.

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t Margo is a great Star. A true Star.
t She never was or will be anything
t less or anything less... 
tt(slight pause)
t ... the part for which Eve
t Harrington is receiving the Sarah
t Siddons Award was intended
t originally for Margo Channing...

Addison, having sipped his soda water, puts a new cigarette
in his holder, leans back, lights it, looks and exhales in
the general direction of the table of honor. As he speaks the
CAMERA MOVES in the direction of his glance...

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t Having covered in tedious detail
t not only the history of the Sarah
t Siddons Society, but also the
t history of acting since Thespis
t first stepped out of the chorus
t line - our distinguished chairman
t has finally arrived at our reason
t for being here...  

At this point Addison's voice FADES OUT and the voice of the
aged actor FADES IN. CAMERA is in MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT of him
and the podium. 

<b>tttAGED ACTOR
</b>t I have been proud and privileged to
t have spent my life in the Theater -
t "a poor player ... that struts and
t frets his hour upon the stage" -
t and I have been honored to be, for
t forty years, Chief Promoter of the
t Sarah Siddons Society...
tt(he lifts the Sarah
tt Siddons Award from its
tt altar)
t Thirty-nine times have I placed in
t deserving hands this highest honor
t the Theater knows...
tt(he grows a bit arch, he
tt uses his eyebrows)
t Surely no actor is older than I - I
t have earned my place out of the
t sun...
tt(indulgent laughter)
t ... and never before has this Award
t gone to anyone younger than its
t recipient tonight. How fitting that
t it should pass from my hands to
t hers...

EVE HANDS: Lovely, beautifully groomed. In serene repose,
they rest between a demi-tasse cup and an exquisite small
evening cup.  

<b>tttAGED ACTOR
</b>t Such young hands. Such a young
t lady. Young in years, but whose
t heart is as old as the Theater...

Addison's eyes narrow quizzically as he listens. Then,
slowly, he turns to look at Karen...

<b>tttAGED ACTOR
</b>t Some of us a privileged to know
t her. We have seen beyond the beauty
t and artistry- 

Karen never ceases her thoughtful pat-a-cake with the crumbs. 

<b>tttAGED ACTOR
</b>t -that have made her name resound
t through the nation. We know her
t humility. Her devotion, her loyalty
t to her art. 

Addison's glance moves from Karen to Margo. 

<b>tttAGED ACTOR
</b>t Her love, her deep and abiding love
t for us-

Margo's face is a mask. She looks down at the drink which she
cradles with both hands. 

<b>tttAGED ACTOR
</b>t -for what we are and what we do.
t The Theater. She has had one wish,
t one prayer, one dream. To belong to
t us. 
tt(he's nearing his curtain
tt line)
t Tonight her dream has come true.
t And henceforth we shall dream the
t same of her. 
tt(a slight pause)
t Honored members, ladies and
t gentlemen - for distinguished
t achievement in the Theater - the
t Sarah Siddons Award to Miss Eve
t Harrington. 

The entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous
applause. Some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet...
Flash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the
Aged Actor's left... 

Eve rises - beautiful, radiant, poised, exquisitely gowned.
She stands in simple and dignified response to the ovation. 

A dozen photographers skip, squat, and dart about like water
bugs. Flash bulbs pop and pop and pop...

THE WAITERS applaud enthusiastically...

AGED ACTOR, Award in hand, he beams at her...

EVE smiles sweetly to her left, then to her right...

MAX has come to. He applauds lustily.

ADDISON's applauding too, more discreetly. 

MARGO, not applauding. But you sense no deliberate slight,
merely an impression that as she looks at Eve her mind is on
something else...

KAREN, nor is she applauding. But her gaze is similarly fixed
on Eve in a strange, faraway fashion. 

ADDISON, still applauding, his eyes flash first at Margo and
then at Karen. Then he directs them back to Eve. He smiles
ever so slightly.  

The applause has continued unabated. EVE turns now, and moves
gracefully toward the Aged Actor. She moves through
applauding ladies and gentlemen; from below the flash bulbs
keep popping... 

As she nears her goal, the Ages Actor turns to her. He holds
out the award. Her hand reaches out for it. At that precise
moment - with the award just beyond her fingertips - THE
PICTURE HOLDS, THE ACTION STOPS. The SOUND STOPS. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t Eve. Eve, the Golden Girl. The
t cover girl, the girl next door, the
t girl on the moon... Time has been
t good to Eve, Life goes where she
t goes - she's been profiled,
t covered, revealed, reported, what
t she eats and when and where, whom
t she knows and where she was and
t when and where she's going...   

ADDISON has stopped applauding, he's sitting forward, staring
intently at Eve... his narration continues unbroken.

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t ... Eve. You all know all about
t Eve... what can there be to know
t that you don't know...?

As he leans back, the APPLAUSE FADES IN as tumultuous as
before. Addison's look moves slowly from Eve to Karen.  

KAREN, she leans forward now, her eyes intently on Eve. Her
lovely face FILLS THE SCREEN as the APPLAUSE FADES ONCE MORE -
as she thinks back:

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t When was it? How long? It seems a
t lifetime ago. Lloyd always said
t that in the Theater a lifetime was
t a season, and a season a lifetime.
t It's June now. That was - early
t October... only last October. It
t was a drizzly night, I remember I
t asked the taxi to wait...

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. NEW YORK THEATER STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Traffic is not heavy, the shows have broken some half-hour
before. The rain is just a drizzle. 

There are other theaters on the street; display lights are
being extinguished. Going out just as Karen's taxi pulls up
is: MARGO CHANNING in 'AGED IN WOOD'. The marquis display
below includes "Max Fabian Presents" and "By Lloyd Richards."

The taxi comes to a stop at the alley. Karen can be seen
through the closed windows telling the driver to wait. Then
she gets out. She takes a step, hesitates, then looks about
curiously:

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t Where was she? Strange... I had
t become so accustomed to seeing her
t there night after night - I found
t myself looking for a girl I'd never
t spoken to, wondering where she
t was...

She smiles a little at her own romanticism, puts her head
down and makes her way into the alley. 

<b>EXT. ALLEY - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
Karen moves toward the stage door. She passes a recess in the
wall - perhaps an exit - about halfway. 

<b>tttEVE'S VOICE
</b>tt(softly)
t Mrs. Richards...

Karen hesitates, looks. Eve is barely distinguishable in the
shadow of the recess. Karen smiles, waits. Eve comes out. A
gooseneck light above them reveals her... 

She wears a cheap trench coat, low-heeled shoes, a rain hat
stuck on the back of her head... Her large, luminous eyes
seem to glow up at Karen in the strange half-light. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t So there you are. It seemed odd,
t suddenly, your not being there...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Why should you think I wouldn't be?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Why should you be? After all, six
t nights a week - for weeks - of
t watching even Margo Channing enter
t and leave a theater-

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I hope you don't mind my speaking
t to you...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Not at all. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I've seen you so often - it took
t every bit of courage I could raise-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(smiles)
t To speak to just a playwright's
t wife? I'm the lowest form of
t celebrity...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You're Margo Channing's best
t friend. You and your husband are
t always with her - and Mr.
t Sampson... what's he like?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(grins)
t Bill Sampson? He's - he's a
t director.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t He's the best. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t He'll agree with you. Tell me, what
t do you between the time Margo goes
t in and comes out? Just huddle in
t that doorway and wait? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Oh, no. I see the play. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(incredulous)
t You see the play? You've seen the
t play every performance?
tt(Eve nods)
t But, don't you find it - I mean
t apart from everything else - don't
t you find it expensive? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Standing room doesn't cost much. I
t manage. 

Karen contemplates Eve. Then she takes her arm. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I'm going to take you to Margo...

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(hanging back)
t Oh, no...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t She's got to meet you-

<b>tttEVE
</b>t No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be
t just another tongue-tied gushing
t fan...

Karen practically propels her toward the stage door. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(insisting)
t There isn't another like you, there
t couldn't be- 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t But if I'd known... maybe some
t other time... I mean, looking like
t this. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t You look just fine...
tt(they're at the stage
tt door)
t ... by the way. What's your name?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Eve. Eve Harrington. 

Karen opens the door. They go in. 

<b>INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
Everything, including the doorman, looks fireproof. 

Eve enters like a novitiate's first visit to the Vatican.
Karen, with a "Good evening, Gus -" to the doorman, leads the
way toward Margo's stage dressing room. Eve, drinking in the
wonderment of all the surveys, lags behind. Karen waits for
her to catch up... 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You can breathe it - can't you?
t Like some magic perfume...

Karen smiles, takes Eve's arm. They proceed to Margo's
dressing room. 

<b>EXT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
No star on the closed door; the paint is peeling. A type
written chit, thumbtacked, says MISS CHANNING.

As Karen and Eve approach it, an uninhibited guffaw from
Margo makes them pause. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(whispers)
t You wait a minute...
tt(smiles)
t ... now don't run away-

Eve smiles shakily. At the same moment:

<b>tttMARGO'S VOICE
</b>tt(loudly; through the door)
t "Honey chile," I said, "if the
t South had won the war, you could
t write the same plays about the
t North!"

Karen enters during the line. 

<b>INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
It is a medium-sized box, lined with hot water pipes and
cracked plaster. It is furnished in beat-up wicker. A door
leads to an old-fashioned bathroom. 

Margo is at the dressing table. She wears an old wrapper, her
hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies
before her like a dead poodle. Also before her is an almost
finished drink. 

LLOYD RICHARDS is stretched out on the wicker chaise. He's in
his late thirties, sensitive, literate. 

Between them, by the dressing table, is BIRDIE - Margo's
maid. Her age is unimportant. She was conceived during a
split week in Walla Walla and born in a carnival riot. She is
fiercely loyal to Margo. 

Karen enters during the line Margo started while she was
outside. Lloyd chuckles, Birdie cackles. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Hi.
tt(she goes to kiss Lloyd)
t Hello, darling-

<b>tttMARGO 
</b>t Hi. 
tt(she goes right on - in a
tt think "Suth'n" accent)
t "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't
t think you can rightly say we lost
t the wah, we was mo' stahved out,
t you might say - an' that's what ah
t don' unnerstand about all these
t plays about love-stahved Suth'n
t women - love is one thing we was
t nevah stahved for the South!"

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t How was the concert?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Loud.

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Lemme fix you a drink. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t No thanks, Birdie. 

Karen laughs with them. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Margo's interview with a lady
t reporter from the South-

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t The minute it gets printed they're
t gonna fire on Gettysburg all over
t again...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It was Fort Sumter they fired on-

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t I never played Fort Sumter.

She takes the wig into the bathroom. Margo starts creaming
the make-up off her face. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Honey chili had a point. You know,
t I can remember plays about women -
t even from the South - where it
t never even occurred to them whether
t they wanted to marry their fathers
t more than their brothers...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t That was way back...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Within your time, buster. Lloyd,
t honey, be a playwright with guts.
t Write me one about a nice, normal
t woman who shoots her husband. 

Birdie comes out of the bathroom without the wig. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t You need new girdles. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Buy some. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t The same size? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Of course!

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Well. I guess a real tight girdle
t help when you're playin' a lunatic.  

She picks up Lloud empty glass, asks "more"? He shakes his
head. She pours herself a quick one. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(firmly)
t Margo does not play a lunatic,
t Birdie. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t I know. She just keeps hearin' her
t dead father play the banjo. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It's the tight girdle that does it. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I find these wisecracks
t increasingly less funny! 'Aged in
t Wood' happens to be a fine and
t distinguished play-

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t - 'at's my loyal little woman. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t The critics thought so, the
t audiences certainly think so -
t packed houses, tickets for months
t in advance - I can't see that
t either of Lloyd's last two plays
t have hurt you any!

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Easy, now...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(grins)
t Relax, kid. It's only me and my big
t mouth...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(mollified)
t It's just that you get me so mad
t sometimes... of all the women in
t the world with nothing to complain
t about-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(dryly)
t Ain't it the truth?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Yes, it is! You're talented,
t famous, wealthy - people waiting
t around night after night just to
t see you, even in the wind and
t rain...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Autograph fiends! They're not
t people - those little beast who run
t in packs like coyotes-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t They're your fans, your audience-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t They're nobody's fans! They're
t juvenile delinquents, mental
t detectives, they're nobody's
t audience, they never see a play or
t a movie, even - they're never
t indoors long enough!

There is a pause. Lloyd applauds lightly. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Well... there's one indoors now.
t I've brought her back to see you. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You've what? 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(in a whisper)
t She's just outside the door. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(to Birdie; also a
tt whisper)
t The heave-ho. 

Birdie starts. Karen stops her. It's all in whisper, now,
until Eve comes in. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t You can't put her out, I
t promised... Margo, you've got to
t see her, she worships you, it's
t like something out of a book-

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t That book is out of print, Karen,
t those days are gone.
t Fans no longer pull the carriage
t through the streets - they tear off
t clothes and steal wrist watches...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t If you'd only see her, you're her
t whole life - you must have spotted
t her by now, she's always there...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Kind of mousy trench coat and funny
t hat?
tt(Karen nods)
t How could I miss her? Every night
t and matinee - well...

She looks to Birdie. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Once George Jessel played my
t hometown. For a girl, gettin' in to
t see him was easy. Gettin' out was
t the problem...

They all laugh. Karen goes to the door, opens it. Eve comes
in. Karen closes the door behind her. A moment. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(simply)
t I thought you'd forgotten about me. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Not at all. 
tt(her arm through Eve's)
t Margo, this is Eve Harrington. 

Margo changes swiftly into a first-lady-of-the-theater
manner. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(musically)
t How do you do, my dear. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>tt(mutters)
t Oh, brother. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Hello, Miss Channing. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t My husband...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(nicely)
t Hello, Miss Harrington. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t How do you do, Mr. Richards. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(graciously)
t And this is my good friend and
t companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Oh, brother. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Miss Coonan...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(to Birdie)
t Oh brother what? 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t When she gets like this... all of a
t sudden she's playin' Hamlet's
t mother...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(quiet menace)
t I'm sure you must have things to do
t in the bathroom, Birdie dear. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t If I haven't, I'll find something
t till you're normal.

She goes into the bathroom. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down,
t Miss Worthington? 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Harrington. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't
t you sit down? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Thank you. 

She sits. A short lull.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Would you like a drink? It's right
t beside you... 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I was telling Margo and Lloyd about
t how often you'd seen the play...

They start together, and stop in deference to each other.
They're a little flustered. But not Eve. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(to Margo)
t No, thank you.
tt(to Lloyd)
t Yes. I've seen every performance. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(delighted)
t Every performance? Then - am I safe
t in assuming you like it? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'd like anything Miss Channing
t played...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(beams)
t Would you, really? How sweet-

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(flatly)
t I doubt very much that you'd like
t her in 'The Hairy Ape'.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr.
t Richards. I think that part of Miss
t Channing's greatness lies in her
t ability to choose the best plays...
t your new play is for Miss Channing,
t isn't it, Mr. Richards?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Of course it is.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t How'd hear about it?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t There was an item in the Times. i
t like the title. 'Footsteps on the
t Ceiling'.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Let's get back to this one. Have
t you really seen every performance? 
tt(Eve nods)
t Why? I'm curious...

Eve looks at Margo, then drops her eyes. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Well. If I didn't come to see the
t play, I wouldn't have anywhere else
t to go. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t There are other plays...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Not with you in them. Not by Mr.
t Richards...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t But you must have friends, a
t family, a home-

Eve pauses. Then shakes her head. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Tell us about it - Eve...

Eve looks at her - grateful because Karen called her "Eve."
Then away, again...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t If I only knew how...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Try...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Well...

Birdie comes out of the bathroom. Everybody looks at her
sharply. She realizes she's in on something important. She
closes the door quietly, leans against it.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Well... it started with the play
t before this one...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t 'Remembrance'.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Did you see it here in New York?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t San Francisco. It was the last
t week. I went one night... the most
t important night in my life - until
t this one. Anyway... I found myself
t going the next night - and the next
t and the next. Every performance.
t Then, when the show went East - I
t went East. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t I'll never forget that blizzard the
t night we played Cheyenne. A cold
t night. First time I ever saw a
t brassiere break like a piece of
t matzos... 

Eve looks at her unsmilingly, then back to her hands. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Eve... why don't you start at the
t beginning? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t It couldn't possibly interest you. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Please...

Eve speaks simply and without self-pity. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I guess it started back home.
t Wisconsin, that is. There was just
t mum, and dad - and me. I was the
t only child, and I made believe a
t lot when I was a kid - I acted out
t all sorts of things... what they
t were isn't important. But somehow
t acting and make-believe began to
t fill up my life more and more, it
t got so that I couldn't tell the
t real from the unreal except that
t the unreal seemed more real to
t me... I'm talking a lot of
t gibberish, aren't I? 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Not at all...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Farmers were poor in those days,
t that's what dad was - a farmer. I
t had to help out. So I quit school
t and I went to Milwaukee. I became a
t secretary. In a brewery.
tt(she smiles)
t When you're a secretary in a
t brewery - it's pretty hard to make
t believe you're anything else.
t Everything is beer. It wasn't much
t fun, but it helped at home -  and
t there was a Little Theater Group...
t like a drop of rain in the desert.
t That's where I met Eddie. He was a
t radio technician. We played
t 'Liliom' for three performances, I
t was awful - then the war came, and
t we got married. Eddie was in the
t air force - and they sent him to
t the South Pacific. You were with
t the O.W.I., weren't you Mr.
t Richards?
tt(Lloyd nods)
t That's what 'Who's Who' says...
t well, with Eddie gone, my life went
t back to beer. Except for a letter a
t week. One week Eddie wrote he had a
t leave coming up. I'd saved my money
t and vacation time. I went to San
t Francisco to meet him. 
tt(a slight pause)
t Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded
t the telegram from Milwaukee - the
t one that came from Washington to
t say that Eddie wasn't coming at
t all. That Eddie was dead...
tt(Karen puts her hand on
tt Lloyd's)
t ... so I figured I'd stay in San
t Francisco. i was alone, but
t couldn't go back without Eddie. I
t found a job. And his insurance
t helped... and there were theaters
t in San Francisco. And one night
t Margo Channing came to play in
t 'Remembrance'... and I went to see
t it. And - well - here I am...

She finishes dry-eyes and self-composed. Margo squeezes the
bridge of her nose, dabs at her eyes. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>tt(finally)
t What a story. Everything but the
t bloodhounds snappin' at her rear
t end...

That breaks the spell. Margo turns to her-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t There are some human experiences,
t Birdie, that do not take place in a
t vaudeville house - and that even a
t fifth-rate vaudevillian should
t understand and respect!
tt(to Eve)
t I want to apologize for Birdie's-

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>tt(snaps in)
t You don't have to apologize for me!
tt(to Eve)
t I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
t It's just my way of talkin'...

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(nicely)
t You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss
t Coonan...

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Call me Birdie. 
tt(to Margo)
t As for bein' fifth-rate - i closed
t the first half for eleven years an'
t you know it!

She slams into the bathroom again. At that precise instant
BILL SAMPSON flings open the door to the dressing room. He's
youngish, vital, undisciplined. He lugs a beat-up suitcase
which he drops as he crosses to Margo-

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Forty-five minutes from now my
t plane takes off and how do I find
t you? Not ready yet, looking like a
t junk yard-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Thank you so much. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Is it sabotage, does my career mean
t nothing to you? Have you no human
t consideration? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Show me a human and I might have!

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(conscious of Eve)
t Bill...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t The air lines have clocks, even if
t you haven't! I start shooting a
t week from Monday - Zanuck is
t impatient, he wants me, he needs
t me!

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(louder)
t Bill-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Zanuck, Zanuck, Zanuck! What are
t you two - lovers? 

Bill grins suddenly, drops to one knee beside her.

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(smiling)
t Only in some ways. You're
t prettier...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I'm a junk yard. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(yells)
t Bill!

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(vaguely; to Karen)
t Huh?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t This is Eve Harrington.

Bill flashes a fleeting look at Eve. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Hi.
tt(to Margo)
t My wonderful junk yard. The mystery
t and dreams you find in a junk yard-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(kisses him)
t Heaven help me, I love a psychotic. 

Bill grins, rises, sees Eve as if for the first time. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Hello, what's your name? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Eve. Eve Harrington. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t You've already met. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Where? 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Right here. A minute ago. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t That's nice. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t She, too, is a great admirer of
t yours. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Imagine. All this admiration in
t just one room. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Take your mistress into the
t bathroom and dress her.
tt(Birdie opens her mouth)
t Without comment. 

Birdie shuts it and goes into the bathroom. In a moment we
hear a shower start to run. Eve gets up. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t You're not going, are you?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I think I'd better. It's been -
t well, I can hardly find the words
t to say how it's been...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(rises)
t No, don't go...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t The four of you must have so much
t to say to each other - with Mr.
t Sampson leaving...

Margo, impulsively crosses to Eve. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Stick around. Please. Tell you what
t - we'll put Stanislavsky on his
t plane, you and I, then go somewhere
t and talk. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Well - if I'm not in the way...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I won't be a minute. 

She darts into the bathroom. Eve sits down again. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Lloyd, we've got to go-

Lloyd gets up. Karen crosses to pound on the bathroom door.
She yells - the shower is going...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Margo, good night! I'll call you
t tomorrow!

Margo's answer is lost in the shower noise. Karen crosses to
kiss Bill. She's joined by Lloyd. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Good luck, genius...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Geniuses don't need good luck.
tt(he grins)
t I do. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t I'm not worried about you. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Keep the thought. 

They shake hands warmly. Karen and Lloyd move to Eve. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Good night, Eve. I hope I see you
t again soon-

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow
t matinee-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Not just that way. As a friend...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'd like that. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t It's been a real pleasure, Eve. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good
t night...

Lloyd shakes her hand, crosses to join Karen who waits at the
open dressing room door. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Mrs. Richards.
tt(Karen and Lloyd look
tt back)
t ... I'll never forget this night as
t long as I live. And I'll never
t forget you for making it possible. 

Karen smiles warmly. She closes the door. They leave. 

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t - and I'll never forget you, Eve.
t Where were we going that night,
t Lloyd and I? Funny the things you
t remember - and the things you
t don't...

<b>INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Eve sits on the same chair. Bill keeps moving around. Eve
never takes her eyes off him. He offers her a cigarette. She
shakes her head. He looks at his watch. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You said forty-seven minutes.
t You'll never make it. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(grins)
t I told you a lie. We'll make it
t easily. Margo's got no more
t conception of time than a halibut. 

He goes to the dressing table, picks up Margo's pocketbook,
opens it. He finds a letter. He glances at it, puts it back.

<b>tttBILL
</b>t She's been carrying that letter
t around for weeks. I've read it
t three times...

There's a sudden sharp yelp from the bathroom. 

<b>tttMARGO'S VOICE
</b>t You're supposed to zip the zipper -
t not me. 

<b>tttBIRDIE'S VOICE
</b>t Like tryin' to zip a pretzel -
t stand still!

Bill grins. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t What a documentary those two would
t make... like the mongoose and the
t cobra-

He sprawls on the chaise, closes his eyes. A pause.

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(finally)
t So you're going to Hollywood.

Bill grunts in the affirmative. Silence. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Why?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I just wondered.

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Just wondered what?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Why.

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Why what?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Why you have to go out there.

<b>tttBILL
</b>t I don't have to. I want to.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Is it the money?

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Eighty percent of it will go for
t taxes. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Then why? Why, if you're the best
t and most successful young director
t in the Theater-

<b>tttBILL
</b>t The Theatuh, the Theatuh-
tt(he sits up)
t - what book of rules says the
t Theater exists only within some
t ugly buildings crowded into one
t square mile of New York City? Or
t London, Paris or Vienna?
tt(he gets up)
t Listen, junior. And learn. Want to
t know what the Theater is? A flea
t circus. Also opera. Also rodeos,
t carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal
t dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man
t band - all Theater. Wherever
t there's magic and make-believe and
t an audience - there's Theater.
t Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone
t Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles
t Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty
t Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora
t Duse. You don't understand them
t all, you don't like them all, why
t should you? The Theater's for
t everybody - you included, but not
t exclusively - so don't approve or
t disapprove. It may not be your
t Theater, but it's Theater of
t somebody, somewhere. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I just asked a simple question. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(grins)
t And I shot my mouth off. Nothing
t personal, junior, no offense...
tt(he sits back down)
t ... it's just that there's so much
t bushwah in this Ivory Green Room
t they call the Theatuh - sometimes
t it gets up around my chin...

He lies down again. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t But Hollywood. You mustn't stay
t there. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(he closes his eyes)
t It's only one picture deal. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t So few come back...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Yeah. They keep you under drugs out
t there with armed guards...

A pause.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I read George Jean Nathan every
t week.

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Also Addison deWitt. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Every day. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t You didn't have to tell me. 

Margo, putting on an earring, buzzes out of the bathroom
followed by Birdie. Bill sits up. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(en route)
t I understand it's the latest thing -
t just one earring. If it isn't, it's
t going to be - I can't find the
t other...

She grabs her pocketbook, starts rummaging. Out comes the
letter...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Throw that dreary thing away, it
t bores me-

Margo drops it in the wastebasket, keeps rummaging. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(concerned)
t Where do you suppose it could be?

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t It'll show up.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(gives up)
t Oh well...
tt(to Birdie)
t ... look through the wigs, maybe it
t got caught-

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Real diamonds in a wig. The world
t we live in...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(she's been looking)
t Where's my coat?

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Right where you left it...

She goes behind the chaise. She comes up with a magnificent
mink. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(to Margo)
t The seams. 

Margo starts to straighten them. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(to Eve)
t Can't keep his eyes off my legs. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Like a nylon lemon peel-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(straightens up)
t Byron couldn't have said it more
t graciously... here we go-

By now she's in the coat and has Eve's arm, heading for the
door. Bill puts his arms around Birdie. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Got any messages? What do you want
t me to tell Tyrone Power?

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Just give him my phone number, I'll
t tell him myself. 

Bill kisses her cheek. She kisses Bill. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Kill the people. 
tt(to Margo)
t Got your key?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(nods)
t See you home...

Margo and Eve precede Bill out of the door...

<b>EXT. LAGUARDIA FIELD - NIGHT
</b>
American Airlines baggage counter. The rain has stopped, but
it's wet. 

Margo, Eve, and Bill are stymied behind two or three couples
waiting to be checked in. Margo's arm is through Bill's. They
become increasingly aware of their imminent separation. Eve
senses her superfluity. 

A lull. Bill cranes at the passenger heading the line, in
earnest conversation with the dispatcher. He sighs. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t They have to time it so everybody
t gets on at the last minute. So they
t can close the doors and let you
t sit. 

The man up ahead moves on.

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Ah...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I have a suggestion.
tt(they look at her)
t There's really not much time left -
t I mean, you haven't had a minute
t alone yet, and - well, I could take
t care of everything here and meet
t you at the gate with the ticket...
t if you'd like. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t I think we'd like very much. Sure
t you won't mind?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Of course not. 

Bill hands Eve the ticket. Margo smiles gratefully at her.
Eve smiles back. 

<b>EXT. PASSAGE AND GATE - LAGUARDIA - NIGHT
</b>
It's covered, with glass windows. Margo's arm is in Bill's. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t She's quite a girl, that what's-her
t name...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that
t way...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t The lack of pretense, that sort of
t strange directness and
t understanding-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Did she tell you about the Theater
t and what it meant? 

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(grins)
t I told her. I sounded off. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t All the religions in the world
t rolled into one, and we're Gods and
t Goddesses... isn't it silly,
t suddenly I've developed a big
t protective feeling for her - a lamb
t loose in our big stone jungle...

Bill pauses and pulls her to one side. Some passengers go by.
A pause. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Take care of yourself out there...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t I understand they've got the
t Indians pretty well in hand...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Bill...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Huh?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Don't get stuck on some glamour
t puss-

<b>tttBILL
</b>t I'll try.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You're not such a bargain, you
t know, conceited and thoughtless and
t messy-

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t - you're a setup for some gorgeous
t wide-eyed young babe.

<b>tttBILL
</b>t How childish are you going to get
t before you quit it? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I don't want to be childish, I'd
t settle for just a few years-

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(firmly)
t And cut that out right now. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

<b>tttBILL
</b>t As of this moment you're six years
t old...

He starts to kiss her, stops when he becomes aware of Eve
standing near them. She has his ticket in her hand. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t All ready.

She hands Bill his ticket, they start toward the gate. 

<b>INT. BOARDING GATE - LAGUARDIA - NIGHT
</b>
The D.C. 6 in the b.g. A few visitors. Bill hands his ticket
to the guard, turns to Eve. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Thanks for your help... good luck. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.

Bill puts his arms around Margo. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Knit me a muffler. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Call me when you get in...

They kiss. Margo's arms tighten desperately. Bill pulls away,
kisses her again lightly, starts for the plane. Margo turns
away. Eve puts her arms through Margo's. 

Bill pauses en route to the plane. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Hey - junior...

Margo turns to look at him with Eve. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Keep your eyes on her. Don't let
t her get lonely. She's a loose lamb
t in a jungle...

Eve looks at Margo. Margo smiles. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Don't worry...

Bill waves, climbs aboard. The door is closed behind him, the
departure routine starts...

Margo and eve turn to go. They walk down the passage. As they
walk, Eve gently disengages her arm from Margo's and puts it
comfortingly about her...

<b>tttMARGO'S VOICE
</b>t That same night we sent for Eve's
t things, her few pitiful
t possessions... she moved into the
t little guest room on the top
t floor...

<b>INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT
</b>
MARGO slides her fingers reflectively up and down the sides
of the almost empty highball glass. 

<b>tttMARGO'S VOICE
</b>t ... she cried when she saw it - it
t was so like her little room back
t home in Wisconsin.

ADDISON eyeing her quizzically. He offers her the whiskey. 

MARGO shakes her head, absently. She looks down at her glass
again. Then, she raises her eyes to look at Eve. 

<b>tttMARGO'S VOICE
</b>t ... the next three weeks were out
t of a fairy tale - and I was
t Cinderella in the last act. Eve
t became my sister, lawyer, mother,
t friend, psychiatrist and cop - the
t honeymoon was on...

<b>INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
It's one floor above street level. A long narrow room,
smartly furnished - including a Sarah Siddons Award. 

MARGO'S NARRATIVE overlaps into the scene which is a SILENT
<b>ONE. 
</b>
Eve sits at a smart desk. She is just arranging a stack of
letters which she carries to Margo with a pen. Margo sits
comfortably by the fire with a play script. She hands the
scrips up to Eve, shakes her head and holds her nose. Eve
smiles, takes the script, hands Margo the letters to sign.

Birdie comes in with a tea tray which she sets on a low table
before the fire. 

The phone rings.

Birdie and Eve both go for it. Eve gets there first. By her
polite but negative attitude, we know she is giving someone a
skillful brush-off.

Birdie glares first at her, then at Margo. 

Margo leans her head back, closes her eyes blissfully...

Birdie slams the double door to the landing on her way out...

<b>INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - DAY
</b>
From the wings. The audience is never visible. Eve in the
f.g. Margo and company taking a curtain call. Tumultuous
applause... the curtain falls. The cast, except for Margo and
two male leads, walk off. The curtain rises again...

EVE, watching and listening to the storm of applause. Her
eyes shine, she clasps and unclasps her hands...

THE STAGE, Eve again in the f.g., but closer. Again the
curtain falls. This time the two men go off. Curtain rises on
Margo alone. If anything, the applause builds...

EVE, that same hypnotic look... there are tears in her eyes.
The curtain falls offscene, then rises again - 

MARGO, the curtain falls again between her and CAMERA...

BACKSTAGE, the curtain just settling on the floor. Margo
starts off. 

<b>tttSTAGE MANAGER
</b>t One more?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(shakes her head)
t From now on it's not applause -
t just something to do till the
t aisles get less crowded...

She walks as she talks and winds up at Eve - still in the
wings. Eve's eyes are wet, she dabs at her nose. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t What - again?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I could watch you play that last
t scene a thousand times and cry
t every time-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(grins)
t Performance number one thousand of
t this one - if I play it that long -
t will take place in a well-padded
t booby hatch...

She takes Eve's arm, they stroll toward her dressing room. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I must say you can certainly tell
t Mr. Sampson's been gone a month. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You certainly can. Especially if
t you're me between now and tomorrow
t morning...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I mean the performance. Except for
t you, you'd think he'd never even
t directed it - it's disgraceful the
t way they change everything
t around...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(smiles)
t Well, teacher's away and actors
t will be actors...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t During your second act scene with
t your father, Roger Ferraday's
t supposed to stay way upstage at the
t arch. He's been coming closer down
t every night...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t When he gets too close, I'll spit
t in his eye.

They're at her dressing room by now. Margo's been unhooking
her gown, with Eve's help. They go in. 

<b>INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It's undergone quite a change. A new carpet, chintz covers
for the furniture, new lampshades, dainty curtains across the
filthy barred window. 

Birdie waits within. She's listening to a fight; she shuts it
off as they enter.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(entering)
t You bought the new girdles a size
t smaller. I can feel it. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Something maybe grew a size bigger.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t When we get home you're going to
t get into one of those girdles and
t act for two and half hours. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t I couldn't get into the girdle in
t two an' a half hours...

Margo's out of her wig and dress by now. She gets into her
robe, sits at the dressing table. Eve's on the chaise, by the
discarded costume.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You haven't noticed my latest bit
t of interior decorating...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(turns, looks)
t Well, you've done so much... what's
t new? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t The curtains. I made them myself. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t They are lovely. Aren't they
t lovely, Birdie? 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Adorable. We now got everything a
t dressing room needs except a
t basketball hoop. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Just because you can't even work a
t zipper. It was very thoughtful,
t Eve, and I appreciate it- 

A pause. Eve rises, picking up Margo's costume.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t While you're cleaning up, I'll take
t this to the wardrobe mistress-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be
t along for it in a minute. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t No trouble at all. 

And she goes out with the costume. Birdie opens her mouth,
shuts it, then opens it again. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t If I may so bold as to say
t something - did you ever hear the
t word "union"?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Behind in your dues? How much?

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t I haven't got a union. I'm slave
t labor. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Well?

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t But the wardrobe women have got
t one. And next to a tenor, a
t wardrobe woman is the touchiest
t thing in show business-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(catching on)
t Oh-oh.

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t She's got two things to do - carry
t clothes an' press 'em wrong - an'
t just let anybody else muscle in...

As she talks, Margo hurries to the door and out after Eve. 

<b>INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
Margo pops out, looks for Eve, then stares in amazement. 

EVE, near the wings. She stands before a couple of cheval
mirrors set up for cast members. She has Margo's dress held
up against her body. She turns this way and that, bows as if
to applause - mimicking Margo exactly...

MARGO watches her curiously. Then she smiles. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(calling)
t Eve-

EVE, startled, whips the gown away, turns to Margo. 

MARGO smiles understandingly. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(quietly)
t I think we'd better let Mrs. Brown
t pick up the wardrobe...

Wordlessly, Eve brings it toward her...

<b>INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Margo's asleep. A bedside clock with a luminous dial reads 3
A.M. exactly. The phone rings. Her head comes up out of the
pillow, she shakes it. She fumbles, switches on a lamp, then
picks up the phone. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Hello..

<b>tttOPERATOR'S VOICE
</b>t We are ready with your call to
t Beverly Hills...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Call, what call?

<b>tttOPERATOR'S VOICE
</b>t It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo
t Channing? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t That's right, but I don't
t understand-

<b>tttOPERATOR'S VOICE
</b>t We are ready with the call you
t placed for 12 midnight, California
t time, to Mr. William Sampson in
t Beverly Hills...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I placed...?

<b>tttOPERATOR'S VOICE
</b>t Go ahead, please...

<b>tttBILL'S VOICE
</b>tt(a loud, happy squawk)
t Margo! What a wonderful surprise!

Margo jumps at his vehemence. As she does so, the SCREEN
WIPES DOWN DIAGONALLY LEFT TO RIGHT, so that Margo remains in
the lower right-hand diagonal of the screen and Bill is
disclosed in the upper left. He, too, is in bed, reading. His
clock says midnight. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(continuing)
t What a thoughtful, ever-lovin'
t thing to do-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(dazed)
t Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?

<b>tttBILL
</b>t You're my girl, aren't you?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t That I am...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Then you're crazy. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(nods in agreement)
t When - when are you coming back? 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I leave in a week - the picture's
t all wrapped up, we previewed last
t night... those previews. Like
t opening out of town, but
t terrifying. There's nothing you can
t do, you're trapped, you're in a tin
t can-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t - in a tin can, cellophane or
t wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want
t you home...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t You in a hurry?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t A big hurry, be quick about it - so
t good night, darling, and sleep
t tight...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Wait a minute! You can't hang up,
t you haven't even said it-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Bill, you know how much I do - but
t over the phone, now really, that's
t kid stuff...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen
t every day, I want to heat it - and
t if you won't say it, you can sing
t it...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(convinced she's gone mad)
t Sing it?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Sure! Like the Western Union boys
t used to do...

Margo's eyes pop. Her jaw and the phone sag. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Bill... Bill, it's your birthday. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t And who remembered it? Who was
t there on the dot, at twelve
t midnight...?

Margo knows damn well it wasn't she. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(miserably)
t Happy birthday, darling...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t The reading could have been better,
t but you said it - now "many happy
t returns of the day..."

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(the same)
t Many happy returns of the day...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I get a party, don't I?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Of course, birthday and welcome
t home... who'll I ask?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(laughs)
t It's no secret, I know all about
t the party - Eve wrote me...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t She did...?

<b>ttt BILL 
</b>t She hasn't missed a week since I
t left - but you know all that, you
t probably tell her what to write...
t anyway, I sent her a list of people
t to ask - check with her. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Yeah... I will.

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t How is Eve? Okay?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Okay. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I love you...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(mutters)
t I'll check with Eve...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t What? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I love you too. Good night, darling-

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t See you...

Margo hangs up. Bill hangs up. He replaces the phone, picks
up his book... SLOW WIPE until ONLY MARGO is on screen. She
puts her phone away. She gets a cigarette. She lights it. She
rolls over on her back...

<b>INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Margo is propped up in bed, still reflective. Birdie comes in
with her breakfast tray and a "hi" which gets a "hi" from
Margo. She starts on some petty chores. Margo takes a sip of
orange juice...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Birdie-

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Hmm?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You don't like Eve, do you?

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Do you want an argument or an
t answer?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t An answer. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t No. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Why not?

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Now you want an argument. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t She works hard. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Night an' day. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t She's loyal and efficient-

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Like an agent with one client.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t She thinks only for me...
tt(no answer from Birdie)
t ... doesn't she? 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>tt(finally)
t Well... let's say she thinks only
t about you, anyway...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t How do you mean that?

Birdie stops whatever it is she's doing.

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t I'll tell you how. Like - let's see
t - like she was studyin' you, like
t you were a play or a book or a set
t of blueprints. How you walk, talk,
t think, eat, sleep-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(breaks in; sharply)
t I'm sure that's very flattering,
t Birdie, and I'm sure there's
t nothing wrong with that!

There is a sharp, brisk knock. Eve comes in. She's dressed in
a smart suit. She carries a leather portfolio.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Good morning!

Margo says "good morning," Birdie says nothing. Eve shows off
the suit, proudly. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Well - what do you think of my
t elegant new suit? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Very becoming. It looks better on
t you than it did on me. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(scoffs)
t I can imagine... you know, all it
t needed was some taking in here and
t letting out there - are you sure
t you won't want it yourself? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Quite sure. I find it just a bit
t too - too "Seventeenish" for me...

<b>tttEVE 
</b>tt(laughs)
t Oh, come now, as though you were an
t old lady... I'm on my way. Is there
t anything more you've thought of-?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t There's the script to go back to
t the Guild-

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I've got it. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t - and those checks or whatever it
t is for the income tax man. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Right here. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It seems I can't think of a thing
t you haven't thought of...

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(smile)
t That's my job.
tt(she turns to go)
t See you at tea time...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Eve...
tt(Eve turns at the door)
t ... by any chance, did you place a
t call from me to Bill for midnight
t California time? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(gasps)
t Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Yes, dear. You forgot all about it. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Well, I was sure you'd want to, of
t course, being his birthday, and
t you've been so busy these past few
t days, and last night I meant to
t tell you before you went out with
t the Richards - and I guess I was
t asleep when you got home...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Yes, I guess you were. It - it was
t very thoughtful of you, Eve. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly
t wouldn't forget that. You'd never
t forgive me. 
tt(she smiles shyly)
t As a matter of fact, I sent him a
t telegram myself...

And she's gone. Margo stares at the closed door. Then at
Birdie. Birdie, without comment, goes out. Margo, alone,
looks down at her orange juice. Absently, she twirls it in
its bed of shaved ice...

<b>INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT
</b>
MARGO, reflectively twirling her highball glass. The applause
continues. She lifts her glass to drink. Her glance meets
Karen's. She raises the glass in a silent toast.   

KAREN smiles wanly at Margo's toast. Then the smile fades as
she looks reflectively back to Eve...

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t I saw Eve quite often after our
t first meeting, but we never really
t talked again - until the party
t Margo gave for Bill when he
t returned from Hollywood...

<b>INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It's January. The bed is littered with fur coats. Through the
open door, from the floor below, the murmur of a party at a
late hour. No hilarity. 

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t It's always convenient at a party
t to know the hostess well enough to
t use her bedroom rather than go
t where all the others have to go...

Karen is making repairs at Margo's dressing table. Eve
enters, carrying a magnificent sable coat which she drops on
the bed. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Now who's show up at this hour?
t It's time people went home - hold
t that coat up...
tt(Eve holds it up; Karen
tt whistles)
t ... whose is it? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Some Hollywood movie star, her
t plane got in late. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Discouraging, isn't it? Women with
t furs like that where it never gets
t cold...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Hollywood. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Tell me, Eve - how are things with
t you? Happy? 

Eve melts into warmth. She beams, sits on the bed. Karen has
spun around on the dressing table stool. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t There should be a new word for
t happiness. Being here with Miss
t Channing has been - I just can't
t say, she's been so wonderful, done
t so much for me-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(smiles)
t Lloyd says Margo compensates for
t underplaying on the stage by
t overplaying reality...
tt(she gets up, gets her
tt coat)
t ... next to that sable, my new mink
t seems like an old bedjacket... 
tt(throws it over her
tt shoulder)
t ... you've done your share, Eve.
t You've worked wonders with Margo...

She starts out. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(hesitantly)
t Mrs. Richards. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(pauses, smiles)
t Karen.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Karen...
tt(she picks at the
tt coverlet)
t ... isn't it awful, I'm about to
t ask you for another favor - after
t all you've already done. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(crosses to her)
t Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've
t got to stop thinking of yourself as
t one of the Hundred Neediest
t Cases... what is it? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Well... Miss Channing's affairs are
t in such good shape... there isn't
t enough to keep me as busy as I
t should be, really - not that I've
t ever considered anything that would
t take me away from her... but the
t other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian
t tell Miss Channing that her
t understudy was going to have a
t baby, and they'd have to replace
t her... 

She looks down at the coverlet once more. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t ... you want to be Margo's new
t understudy. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I don't let myself think about it,
t even- 
tt(she looks up, rises as
tt she speaks)
t - but I do know the part so well,
t and every bit of the staging,
t there'd be no need to break in a
t new girl-
tt(suddenly afraid, she
tt sits)
t - but suppose I had to go on one
t night? To an audience that came to
t see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't
t possibly...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(laughs)
t Don't worry too much about that.
t Margo just doesn't miss
t performances. If she can walk,
t crawl or roll - she plays. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(nods proudly)
t The show must go on. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t No, dear. Margo must go on. 
tt(she sits beside Eve)
t As a matter of fact, I see no
t reason why you shouldn't be Margo's
t understudy...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Do you think Miss Channing would
t approve?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I think she would cheer. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t They'll do as they're told.

Eve smiles a little. A pause. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian
t about it? 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Of course. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You won't forget it?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I won't forget. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I seem to be forever thanking you
t for something, don't I?

She hugs Karen, leaves. She nearly collides with Birdie on
her way in. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t The bed looks like a dead animal
t act. Which one is sables?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(pointing)
t But she just got here...

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t She's on her way. With half the men
t in the joint. 
tt(she hold up the coat)
t It's only a fur coat...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t What did you expect - live sables?

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t A diamond collar, gold sleeves -
t you know, picture people...

They start out. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Bill says actors out there eat just
t as infrequently as here-

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t They can always grab oranges off
t trees. This you can't do in Times
t Square...

Through the open door, we see them go down the stairs and out
of sight. 

<b>INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING AND STAIRS - NIGHT
</b>
Karen and Birdie come down the stairs to Bill, Max, Addison,
a blonde young lady named MISS CASWELL (Addison's protegee-of
the-moment) - and, at the feet of Bill and Addison... Eve.
They are all seated on the steps.

Birdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floor.
Karen remains with the others. 

Addison is holding forth:

<b>tttADDISON 
</b>t Every now and then, some elder
t statesman of the Theater or cinema
t assures the public that actors and
t actresses are just plain folk.
t Ignoring the fact that their
t greatest attraction to the public
t is their complete lack of
t resemblance to normal human beings.

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>tt(as Birdie and the sables
tt pass)
t Now there's something a girl could
t make sacrifices for. 

<b>tttBILL'S VOICE
</b>t And probably has. 

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t Sable. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>tt(to Miss Caswell)
t Did you say sable - or Gable?

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t Either one. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t It is senseless to insist that
t theatrical folk in New York,
t Hollywood and London are no
t different from the good people of
t Des Moines, Chillicothe and
t Liverpool. By and large, we are
t concentrated gatherings of
t neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional
t misfits, and precocious children-

<b>tttMAX
</b>tt(to Bill)
t Gable. Why a feller like that don't
t come East to do a play...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(nods)
t He must be miserable, the life he
t lives out there-

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t These so-called abnormalities -
t they're our stock in trade, they
t make us actors, writers, directors,
t et cetera in the first place-

<b>tttMAX
</b>t Answer me this. What makes a man
t become a producer?

<b>tttADDISON 
</b>t What makes a man walk into a lion
t cage with nothing but a chair?

<b>tttMAX
</b>t This answer satisfies me a hundred
t percent. 

<b>tttADDISON 
</b>t We all have abnormality in common.
t We are a breed apart from the rest
t of the humanity, we Theater folk.
t We are the original displaced
t personalities...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(laughs; to Eve)
t You don't have to read his column
t tomorrow - you just heard it. I
t don't agree, Addison...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t That happens to be your particular
t abnormality. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Oh, I admit there's a screwball
t element in the Theater. It sticks
t out, it's got spotlights on it and
t a brass band. But it isn't basic,
t it isn't standard - if it were, the
t Theater couldn't survive...

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>tt(to a passing butler)
t Oh, waiter...

The butler goes right by.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t That isn't a waiter, my dear.
t That's a butler. 

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler,"
t can I? Maybe somebody's name is
t Butler...

<b>tttADDISON 
</b>t You have a point. An idiotic one,
t but a point. 

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t I don't want to make trouble. All I
t want is a drink. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>tt(getting up)
t Leave me get you one...

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>tt(pitching)
t Oh, thank you, Mr. Fabian.

Max leaves with her empty glass. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Well done. I see your career rising
t in the East like the sun...
tt(to Bill)
t ... you were saying?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I was saying that the Theater is
t nine-tenths hard work. Work done
t the hard way - by sweat,
t application and craftsmanship. I'll
t agree to this - that to be a good
t actor, actress, or anything else in
t the Theater, means wanting to be
t that more than anything else in the
t world...

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(abruptly)
t Yes. Yes, it does. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(goes on)
t It means concentration of ambition,
t desire, and sacrifice such as no
t other profession demands... And
t I'll agree that the man or woman
t who accepts those terms can't be
t ordinary, can't be - just someone.
t To give so much for almost always
t so little...

Eve speaks almost unaware of what she says. She looks at no
one in particular, just off...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t So little. So little, did you say?
t Why, if there's nothing else -
t there's applause. It's like - like
t waves of love coming over the
t footlights and wrapping you up.
t Imagine...
t To know, every night, that
t different hundreds of people love
t you... they smile, their eyes shine
t - you've pleased them, they want
t you, you belong. Just that alone is
t worth anything...

She becomes aware of Addison's strange smile, of Bill's looks
of warm interest. She's embarrassed, she turns away - then
scrambles to her feet as Margo approaches with Lloyd from the
direction of the pantry. 

Margo's had too much to drink. Her fake smile fades as Eve
gets up. She's unpleasant and depressed. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Don't get up. And please stop
t acting as if I were the queen
t mother. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(hurt)
t I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(sharply)
t Outside of a beehive, Margo, your
t behavior would hardly be considered
t either queenly or motherly!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You're in a beehive, pal, didn't
t you know? We're all busy little
t bees, full of stings, making honey
t day and night-
tt(to Eve)
t - aren't we, honey?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Margo, really...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Please don't play governess, Karen,
t I haven't your unyielding good
t taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe
t too but father wouldn't hear of it -
t he needed help at the notions
t counter...
tt(to Addison)
t I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR
t should I say "ain't I"?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t You're maudlin and full of self
t pity. You're magnificent. 

Max has come up with Miss Caswell's drink. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t How about calling it a night?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t And you pose as a playwright. A
t situation pregnant with
t possibilities - and all you can
t think of is everybody to go to
t sleep...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t It's a good thought. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It won't play. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t As a nonprofessional, I think it's
t an excellent idea. Undramatic, but
t practical...

As she speaks, she makes her way to Lloyd's side. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Happy little housewife...

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Cut it out.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t This is my house, not a theater! In
t my house you're a guest, not a
t director-!

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Then stop being a star - start
t treating your guests as your
t supporting cast!

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Hear, hear...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Now let's not get into a big hassle-

<b>tttKAREN 
</b>t It's about time we did! It's about
t time Margo realized that what's
t attractive on stage need not
t necessarily be attractive off.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(suddenly)
t All right! I'm going to bed.
tt(to Bill)
t You be the host. It's your party.
t Happy Birthday, welcome home, and
t we-who-are-about-to-die-salute-you.

She starts upstairs.

<b>tttBILL
</b>t Need any help?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(pauses, smiles)
t To put me to bed? Take my clothes
t off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn
t off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve
t would. Wouldn't you, Eve?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t If you'd like. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I wouldn't like. 

She goes up, exits out of sight. A pause. Miss Caswell
reaches up to take the drink out of Max's hand. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>t I forgot I had it. 

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t I didn't. 

Bill gets up and goes after Margo...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Too bad! We'll miss the third act.
t They're going to play it off stage. 

Eve turns away abruptly, in sudden tears. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Coming?

<b>tttKAREN 
</b>t In a minute...

She crosses to Eve, puts an arm around her. 

<b>tttKAREN 
</b>t You mustn't mind Margo too much,
t even if I do...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t But there must be some reason,
t something I've done without
t knowing...

<b>tttKAREN 
</b>t The reason is Margo and don't try
t to figure it out. Einstein
t couldn't. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t If I thought I'd offended her, of
t all people-

<b>tttKAREN 
</b>t Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I
t know Margo. And every now and then
t there is nothing I want to do so
t much as to kick her right square in
t the pants.

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(smiles)
t Well - if she's got to pick on
t someone, I'd just as soon it was
t me.

Karen smiles back. She joins Lloyd and Max. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Max is going to drop us...

<b>tttADDISON 
</b>t I've often wondered, Max, why you
t bother with a chauffeur and
t limousine in New York City.

<b>tttMAX
</b>t In my case it's necessary. Too many
t taxi drivers write plays. 

<b>tttADDISON 
</b>t And too many of them are produced. 

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t Let's go sit by the piano. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t You have me confused with Dan
t Dailey. You go sit by the piano.
tt(to Eve)
t And you come sit by me.
tt(to the others)
t Good night. 

They laugh, say "good night," and start downstairs. As Eve
crosses to Addison:

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Karen...
tt(Karen pauses)
t ... you won't forget, will you?
t What we talked about before?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(smiles)
t No, Eve, I won't forget...

She follows the men downstairs. CLOSE UP of an old engraving
of Mrs. Siddons as 'The Tragic Muse' which hangs among other
theatrical mementos on the stair wall...

<b>INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT
</b>
The applause continues. Margo sits back in her chair now,
picking at a bit of fingernail polish...

<b>tttMARGO'S VOICE
</b>t Bill's welcoming-home-birthday
t party... a night to go down in
t history. Like the Chicago Fire - or
t the Massacre of the Huguenots. Even
t before the party started, I could
t smell disaster in the air...

<b>INT. MARGO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The same night as the previous sequence, but before the party
has started. Margo is all dressed except for jewelry. She
stands before her dressing table putting it on. She sips at
an enormous Martini...

<b>tttMARGO'S VOICE
</b>t I knew it, I sensed it even as I
t finished dressing for that blasted
t party...

Birdie comes in. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t You all put together? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t My back's open.
tt(Birdie goes to work on
tt it)
t Did the extra help get here?

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t There's some loose characters
t dressed like maids and butlers.
t Who'd you call - the William Morris
t Agency?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You're not being funny, I could get
t actors for less. What about the
t food? 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t The caterer had to back for hors
t d'oeuvres-
tt(she zips Margo)
t Voila. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(laughs)
t That French ventriloquist taught
t you a lot, didn't he?

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t There was nothing he didn't know.
tt(she starts tidying the
tt room)
t There's a message from the
t bartender. Does Miss Channing know
t we ordered domestic gin by mistake?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t The only thing I ordered by mistake
t is the guests.
tt(Birdie cackles)
t They're domestic, too, and they
t don't care what they drink as long
t as it burns... where's Bill? He's
t late. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t Late for what?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Don't be dense. The party. 

<b>tttBIRDIE
</b>t I ain't dense. And he's been here
t twenty minutes. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Well, I certainly think it's odd he
t hasn't even come up...

Her glance meets Birdie's. She turns and strolls out. 

<b>INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
</b>
Margo speeds up going down the stairs. 

<b>INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
</b>
Margo shows up again deliberately as she reaches the landing.
Sound of Bill and Eve laughing together from the living room.
Margo strolls toward it casually. 

We see Eve seated, looking up fascinated at Bill as he talks -
out of the laughter...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t "Don't let it worry you," said the
t cameraman, "Even DeMille couldn't
t see anything looking through the
t wrong end-"
tt(Eve chuckles)
t So that was the first and last time-

Eve sees Margo approach. She gets up. Bill turns. 

<b>INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
As Margo strolls up, very off-hand.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Don't let me kill the point. Or
t isn't it a story for grownups?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t You've heard it. About when I
t looked through the wrong end of a
t camera finder. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(to Eve)
t Remind me to tell you about when I
t looked into the heart of an
t artichoke. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'd like to hear it. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Some snowy night in front of the
t fire... in the meantime, while
t we're on the subject, will you
t check about the hors d'oeuvres? The
t caterer forgot them, the varnish
t wasn't dry or something...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Of course.

She leaves. A short lull. Margo looks into cigarette boxes.
Bill eyes her curiosity, crosses to the fire. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Looks like I'm going to have a very
t fancy party...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I thought you were going to be late-

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t When I'm guest of honor?

<b>tttMARGO 
</b>t I had no idea you were even here. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I ran into Eve on my way upstairs;
t she told me you were dressing. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t That never stopped you before. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Well, we started talking, she
t wanted to know all about Hollywood,
t she seemed so interested...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t She's a girl of so many interests. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t It's a pretty rare quality these
t days. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t She's a girl of so many rare
t qualities. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t So she seems. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(the steel begins to
tt flash)
t So you've pointed out, so often. So
t many qualities, so often. Her
t loyalty, efficiency, devotion,
t warmth, affection - and so young.
t So young and so fair...

Bill catches the drift. Incredulously. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I can't believe you're making this
t up - it sounds like something out
t of an old Clyde Fitch play...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Clyde Fitch, thought you may not
t think so, was well before my time!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(laughs)
t I've always denied the legend that
t you were in 'Our American Cousin'
t the night Lincoln was shot...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I don't think that's funny!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Of course it's funny - this is all
t too laughable to be anything else.
t You know what I think about this -
t this age obsession of yours - and
t now this ridiculous attempt to whip
t yourself up into a jealous froth
t because I spent ten minutes with a
t stage-struck kid-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Twenty minutes!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What
t of it?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Stage-struck kid... she's a young
t lady - of qualities. And I'll have
t you know I'm fed up with both the
t young lady and her qualities!
t Studying me as if - as if I were a
t play or a set of blueprints! How I
t walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Now how can you take offense at a
t kid trying in every way to be as
t much like her ideal as possible! 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Stop calling her a kid! It so
t happens there are particular
t aspects of my life to which I would
t like to maintain sole and exclusive
t rights and privileges!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t For instance what?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t For instance - you!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t This is my cue to take you in my
t arms and reassure you - but I'm not
t going to. I'm too mad-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t - guilty.

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Mad! Darling, there are certain
t characteristics for which you are
t famous - on stage and off. I love
t you for some of them - and in spite
t of others. I haven't let those
t become too important to me. They're
t part of your equipment for getting
t along in what is laughably called
t out environment - you've got to
t keep your teeth sharp. All right.
t But you will not sharpen them on me
t - or on Eve...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t What about her teeth? What about
t her fangs? 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t She hasn't cut them yet, and you
t know it! So when you start judging
t an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by
t the barroom, Benzedrine standards
t of this megalomaniac society - I
t won't have it! Eve Harrington has
t never by word, look, thought or
t suggestion indicated anything to me
t but her adoration for you and her
t happiness at our being in love! And
t to intimate anything else doesn't
t spell jealousy to me - it spells a
t paranoic insecurity that you should
t be ashamed of!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Cut! Print it! What happens in the
t next reel? Do I get dragged off
t screaming to the snake pit? 

<b>tttEVE'S VOICE
</b>tt(quietly)
t Miss Channing?

Bill and Margo look off. Eve is in the room. They have no way
of knowing how long she's been there. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is
t there anything else I can do? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini -
t very dry. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I'll get it.
tt(he crosses to Eve)
t What'll you have? 

Eve, involuntarily, looks to Margo.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t A milkshake?

Eve smiles, turns to Bill. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t A Martini. Very dry, please...

Bill smiles back and starts across the landing toward the
pantry. As he crosses the stairs, Karen, Lloyd and Max come
up from the street level below. General greetings. Bill
continues up to pantry. Eve and then Margo come up to add
their welcome...

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(to Karen)
t May I have your coat?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Don't bother, I can take it up
t myself...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Please...

Karen yields with a "thank you, Eve-." Eve goes up with the
coat. Lloyd looks after her approvingly.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t I like that girl. That quality of
t quiet graciousness...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t ... Among so many quiet qualities.

They start for the living room.

<b>tttKAREN 
</b>t Margo, nothing you've ever done has
t made me as happy as your taking Eve
t in...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I'm so happy you're happy. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>t Look, you haven't been running a
t settlement house exactly - the
t kid's earned her way. You had a
t pretty mixed-up inventory when she
t took over - merchandise laying all
t over the shop...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t You've got Margo mixed up with a
t five-and-ten-cent store...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now
t everything is on its proper shelf,
t eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons.
t I could die right now and nobody'd
t be confused. How about you, Max?

<b>tttMAX
</b>t How about me what? 

They've come to a halt near the fireplace. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Supposed you dropped dead. What
t about your inventory?

<b>tttMAX
</b>t I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit. 

<b>tttKAREN 
</b>t This is the most ghoulish
t conversation...

Bill brings two Martinis. He hands one to Margo. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(it drips ice)
t Thank you. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Nothing, really...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t The kid - junior, that is - will be
t right down. Unless you'd like to
t take her drink up to her...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(smiles)
t I can always get a fresh one. Karen
t - you're a Gibson girl...

He hands Eve's drink to Karen. Max has wandered off. Other
guests are arriving. Margo gulps her drink, hands Bill the
empty glass. He puts it on a passing tray. Margo takes a
fresh one at the same time. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t The general atmosphere is very
t Macbethish. What has or is about to
t happen? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(to Bill)
t What is he talking about? 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Macbeth. 

<b>tttKAREN 
</b>tt(to Margo)
t We know you, we've seen you before
t like this. Is it over - or just
t beginning? 

Margo surveys them all. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Fasten your seat belts. It's going
t to be a bumpy night. 

She downs the drink, hands the empty glass to Bill, and
leaves them. She passes two women, gabbing by the piano. As
they see her:

<b>tttWOMAN #1
</b>t Margo, darling!

<b>tttWOMAN #2
</b>t Darling!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(passing)
t Darlings...

She arrives at the landing just as Addison comes up with Miss
Caswell. Margo takes a drink from a passing tray. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(to Addison)
t I distinctly remember striking your
t name from the guest list. What are
t you doing here?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Dear Margo. You were an
t unforgettable Peter Pan - you must
t play it again, soon. You remember
t Miss Caswell?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I do not. How do you do?

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t We never met. That's why. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Miss Caswell is an actress. A
t graduate of Copacabana School of
t Dramatic Arts. 
tt(his glance is attracted
tt by Eve coming downstairs)
t Ah... Eve.

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(deferentially)
t Good evening, Mr. deWitt.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I had no idea you knew each other.

<b>tttADDISON 
</b>t This must be, at long last, our
t formal introduction. Until now we
t have met only in passing...

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t That's how you met me. In passing. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(smiles)
t Eve, this is an old friend of Mr.
t deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell,
t Miss Harrington...
tt(the two girls say hello)
t Addison, I've been wanting you to
t meet Eve for the longest time-

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(murmurs)
t It could only have been your
t natural timidity that kept you from
t mentioning it...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You've heard of her great interest
t in the Theater-

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t We have that in common. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Then you two must have a long talk-

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'm afraid Mr. deWitt would find me
t boring before too long. 

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t You won't bore him, honey. You
t won't even get to talk. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(icily)
t Claudia dear, come closer.
tt(she does, and he points)
t This is Max Fabian. He is a
t producer. Go do yourself some good. 

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>tt(sighs)
t Why do they always look like
t unhappy rabbits? 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Because that is what they are. Go
t make him happy. 

Miss Caswell drapes her coat over the rail, heads for Max.
Addison puts Eve's arm in his. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(to Margo)
t You mustn't worry about your little
t charge. She is in safe hands. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Amen.

Eve smiles uncertainly at Margo as he leads her away. Margo
looks after them. She downs her drink...

<b>INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It's many Martinis later. Most of the guests have gone. The
party has reached that static state - everyone's assumed more
or less permanent places. 

Birdie passes, carrying a cup of coffee. CAMERA FOLLOWS her
to the piano where Margo sits on the bench beside the
pianist. He is just finishing "Liebestraum" and she stares
moodily into a Martini. Birdie halts beside her with the
coffee. Margo looks up. Birdie holds out the coffee. Margo
takes the onion out of the Martini, drops it into the coffee
and waves Birdie away. Birdie goes. "Liebestraum" comes to an
end. The pianist tries to ease into a more sophisticated
rhythm. Margo stops him. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(quietly)
t "Liebestraum."

<b>tttPIANIST
</b>t I just played it. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Play it again. 

<b>tttPIANIST
</b>t But that was the fourth straight
t time. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Then this will be five. I suppose
t you think I'm too drunk to count. 

<b>tttPIANIST
</b>t No. You're just crazy about
t "Liebestraum."

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t "Liebestraum."

<b>tttPIANIST
</b>t Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of
t depressing. If you don't mind my
t saying so, everybody's kind of
t dying on the vine...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t My dear Horowitz. In the first
t place, I'm paying you union scale.
t Second, it's my piano. Third, if
t everybody doesn't like kind of
t dying on the vine, they can get off
t the vine and go home.
t "Liebestraum."

Unhappily, he plays "Liebestraum." Margo sips her Martini,
stares down into it again. Bill tiptoes up. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>tt(whispers)
t Many of your guests have been
t wondering when they may be
t permitted to view the body. Where
t has it been laid out? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(somberly)
t It hasn't been laid out, we haven't
t finished with the embalming. As a
t matter of fact, you're looking at
t it. The remains of Margo Channing.
t Sitting up. It is my last wish to
t be buried sitting up. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(trying to kid her out of
tt it)
t Wouldn't you feel more natural
t taking a bow?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You know nothing about feelings,
t natural or unnatural. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Then without feeling, your guests
t were also wondering whether the
t music couldn't be a shade more on
t the - shall we say, happier side?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t If my guests do not like it here, I
t suggest they accompany you to the
t nursery where I'm sure you will all
t feel more at home. 

Bill is about to get mad - when Max bustles up. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>t Margo. You by any chance got
t bicarbonate of soda in the house?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(sympathetic)
t Poor Max. Heartburn?
tt(Max nods)
t It's that Miss Caswell. I don't
t know why she doesn't give Addison
t heartburn. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t No heart to burn. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Everybody has a heart - except some
t people.
tt(she finishes her drink,
tt stands up)
t Of course I've got bicarb. There's
t a box in the pantry. We'll put your
t name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say
t there. Always. Just for you. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>tt(touched)
t Let the rest of the world beat
t their brains out for a buck. It's
t friends that count. And I got
t friends. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I love you, Max. I really mean it.
t I love you. Come to the pantry. 

She takes off. Max waits to set Bill straight. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>t She loves me like a father. Also,
t she's loaded. 

He starts off after Margo. As the CAMERA PANS with Bill we
see Margo going into the pantry with Max following her. Bill
joins Addison and Miss Caswell on the stairs. 

<b>INT. PANTRY - NIGHT
</b>
It's a good sized one. In the b.g., the caterers are packing
dishes, glassware, etc. Margo crosses to a cupboard. She
finds the bicarb. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Here you are, Maxie dear. One good
t burp and you'll be rid of that Miss
t Caswell...

<b>tttMAX
</b>t The situation I'm in ain't the kind
t you can belch your way out. I made
t a promise...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Miss Caswell?
tt(Max nods)
t What?

<b>tttMAX
</b>t An audition for the part we're
t replacing. What's-her-name, your
t sister...

He adds water to the bicarb. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Well, if she can act, she might not
t be bad. She looks like she might
t burn down a plantation...

<b>tttMAX
</b>tt(mixing)
t I feel right now like there's one
t burning in me. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t When's the audition?

<b>tttMAX
</b>t A couple of weeks. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I tell you what. Why don't I read
t with her? 

<b>tttMAX
</b>t Would you?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Anything to help you out, Max. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>t This is real cooperation. I
t appreciate it. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Not at all. And you could do me a
t big favor, if you would-

<b>tttMAX
</b>t All you got to do is name it. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Give Eve Harrington job in you
t office.

Max burps. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You get quick action, don't you?

<b>tttMAX
</b>t Margo, I wouldn't think of taking
t that girl away from you...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You said yourself my inventory was
t in good shape - all of my
t merchandise put away. To keep her
t here with nothing to do - I'd be
t standing in her way... and you need
t her, Max. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>t But what could she do?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t She'd be a great help - read
t scripts, interview people you have
t to see, get rid of the ones you
t don't have to... you'd be a man of
t leisure-

<b>tttMAX
</b>t Well...

<b>tttMARGO 
</b>t Think of your health, Max - more
t time to relax out in the fresh air
t at a race track...

<b>tttMAX
</b>t I don't know if this would be a
t wise move...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Promise. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>t I promise. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(happily)
t That's my Max. 

Lloyd enters, looking for her. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t There you are, both of you. Max,
t Karen has decided it's time to go.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Where is she?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Up in the room. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>t If you'll excuse me-
tt(to Margo)
t I'll tell Miss Caswell...

He goes out. A pause. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Who's left out there?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Too many. And you've got a new
t guest. A movie star from Hollywood. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Shucks. And my autograph book is at
t the cleaners.

Another pause. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You disapprove of me when I'm like
t this, don't you?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I
t wish I understood you better.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t When you do, let me in on it. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t I will. 

Another pause. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t How's the new one coming?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t The play? All right, I guess...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t "Cora." She's - still a girl of
t twenty?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Twentyish. It isn't important. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Don't you think it's about time it
t became important?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t How do you mean? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Don't be evasive. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Margo, you haven't got any age. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken
t like a press agent.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t I know what I'm talking about,
t after all they're my plays...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Spoken like an author.
tt(abruptly)
t Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not
t thirtyish. Three months ago, I was
t forty years old. Forty. Four oh.
tt(smiles)
t That slipped out, I hadn't quite
t made up my mind to admit it. Now I
t feel as if I'd suddenly taken all
t my clothes off...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Week after week, to thousands of
t people, you're as young as you
t want...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t ... as young as they want, you
t mean. And I'm not interested in
t whether thousands of people think
t I'm six or six hundred-

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Just one person. Isn't that so?
tt(Margo doesn't answer)
t You know what this is all about,
t don't you? It has very little to do
t with whether you should play "Cora"
t - it has everything to do with the
t fact that you've had another fight
t with Bill. 

A pause. Margo closes the box of bicarb. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Bill's thirty-two. He looks thirty
t two. He looked it five years ago,
t he'll look it twenty years from
t now. I hate men. 
tt(she puts the box down)
t Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your
t play. I'll wear rompers and come in
t rolling a hoop if you like... let's
t go say good night. 

They exit into the dining room. As they open the swinging
door, the CAMERA REMAINS in the doorway. Margo and Lloyd walk
toward the stairs. In the b.g., Eve is talking to the group.
How much she says is dependent on how long it takes Margo and
Lloyd to reach her. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(in the b.g.)
t Imagine... to know, every night,
t that different hundreds of people
t love you... They smile, their eyes
t shine - you've pleased them, they
t want you, you belong. Anything's
t worth that. 

Just as before, she becomes aware of Margo's approach with
Lloyd. She scrambles to her feet...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Don't get up. And please stop
t acting as if I were the queen
t mother. 

And as Margo speaks - or before - we 

<b>FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. N.Y. THEATER STREET - DAY
</b>
Margo gets out of a cab in front of the theater and goes in.
It's Friday afternoon - no performance. 

<b>tttMARGO'S VOICE
</b>t What was it the wise man said -
t "This, too, will pass away"? Two
t weeks later - the day of the
t audition - all was well with Bill
t and me, the world and me-

<b>INT. LOBBY AND FOYER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY
</b>
Margo comes from the street through the lobby ( a few people
buying tickets) and into the deserted foyer. She spots
Addison sprawled on one of the sofas. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Why so remote, Addison? I should
t think you'd be at the side of your
t protegee, lending her moral
t support...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Miss Caswell, at the moment, is
t where I can lend no support - moral
t or otherwise.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t The ladies' - shall we say -
t lounge?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Being violently ill to her tummy. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It's good luck before an audition.
t She'll be all right once it starts.

She heads for the auditorium.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Miss Caswell got lucky too late.
t The audition is over. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(stops)
t Over? It can't be. I've come to
t read with her. I promised Max. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t The audition was called for 2:30.
t It is now nearly four. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(lightly)
t Is it really? I must start wearing
t a watch, I never do, you know...
t who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?
tt(he shakes his head)
t Lloyd?
tt(he shakes his head)
t Well, it couldn't have been Max!
t Who?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Naturally enough, your understudy. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I consider it highly unnatural to
t allow a girl in an advanced state
t of pregnancy-

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t I refer to your new and unpregnant
t understudy. Eve Harrington. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Eve! My understudy...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(keenly)
t Didn't you know?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(quickly)
t Of course I knew. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t It just slipped your mind. 

A moment of silence. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t How... how was Miss Caswell?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Frankly, I don't remember.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Just slipped your mind. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Completely. Nor, I am sure, could
t anyone else present tell you how
t Miss Caswell read or whether Miss
t Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Was she that bad?

As Addison speaks, he rises with excitement.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Margo, as you know, i have lived in
t the Theater as a Trappist monk
t lives in his faith. I have no other
t world, no other life - and once in
t a great while I experience that
t moment of Revelation for which all
t true believers wait and pray. You
t were one. Jeanne Eagels another...
t Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are
t others, three or four. Eve
t Harrington will be among them...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(flatly)
t I take it she read well.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t It wasn't reading, it was a
t performance. Brilliant, vivid,
t something made of music and fire...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t How nice. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t In time she'll be what you are. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t A mass of music and fire. That's
t me. An old kazoo and some sparkles.
t Tell me - was Bill swept away, too,
t or were you too full of Revelation
t to notice?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was
t beside himself. He listened to his
t play as if someone else had written
t it, he said, it sounded so fresh,
t so new, so full of meaning...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t How nice for Lloyd. And how nice
t for Eve. How nice for everybody.

Addison, of course, knows exactly what she's doing. He senses
the approaching typhoon, he whips it up...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Eve was incredibly modest. She
t insisted that no credit was due
t her, that Lloyd felt as he did only
t because she read lines exactly as
t he had written them. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t The implication being that I have
t not been reading them as written.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t To the best of my recollection,
t neither your name nor your
t performance entered the
t conversation. 

Miss Caswell appears, uncertain, in the b.g.

<b>tttADDISON 
</b>t Feeling better, my dear?

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t Like I just swam the English
t Channel. Now what?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t You next move, it seems to me,
t should be toward television. 

Margo, abruptly, starts for the auditorium. Addison smiles.
He takes Miss Caswell's arm. 

<b>tttMISS CASWELL
</b>t Tell me this. Do they have
t auditions for television?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t That's all television is, my dear.
t Nothing but auditions. 

He takes her toward the street. 

<b>INT. THEATER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY
</b>
The curtain is up; the set, covered, is a bedroom in a
deteriorating Southern mansion. 

There is no one in the theater but Max, seated on the aisle
about two-thirds down, and Eve with Lloyd and Bill on the
stage. She is seated; they stand between her and auditorium.
There is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot
make out. Margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace. 

She passes Max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile. She ignores
him as if he were a used paper cup. She disappears through
the door which leads backstage. 

Max whistles. Lloyd turns. Max indicated the door and puts
his hands to his head in despair. 

Margo walks out of the wings on stage. Bill and Lloyd turn to
her. Eve rises. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(cheerily)
t Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was
t long and I couldn't find a cab -
t where's Miss Caswell, shall we
t start? Oh, hello, Eve...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Hello, Miss Channing. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t How are you making out in Mr.
t Fabian's office?
tt(over the footlights to
tt Max)
t I don't want you working the child
t too hard, Max - just because you
t promised. As you see, I kept my
t promise, too...

Max slumps in his seat. By the time Margo turns back to them,
the others have exchanged swift looks. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t It's all over. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t What's all over?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t The audition. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(pleased astonishment)
t Eve?
tt(she turns to her)
t How enchanting...
tt(to Lloyd and Bill)
t Wherever did you get the idea of
t having Eve read with Miss Caswell?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t She's your understudy.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had
t no idea...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t I thought you knew... She was put
t on over a week ago-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It seems almost inconceivable that
t I haven't seen her backstage, but
t with so many people loitering
t around... well, well. So Eve is not
t working for Max after all-
tt(out to Max again)
t - Max you sly puss.

Max submerges further in his seat. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Miss Channing, I can't tell you how
t glad I am that you arrived so late.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Really, Eve? Why?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Well, if you'd been here to begin
t with, I wouldn't have dared to read
t at all...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Why not?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t ... and if you'd come in the
t middle, I'd have stopped, I
t couldn't have gone on-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(murmurs)
t What a pity, all that fire and
t music being turned off...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t What fire and music?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You wouldn't understand. 
tt(to Lloyd)
t How was Miss Caswell?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo,
t let me tell you about Eve-

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(breaking in)
t I was dreadful, Miss Channing,
t believe me - I have no right to be
t anyone's understudy, much less
t yours...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I'm sure you underestimate
t yourself, Eve. You always do.
tt(to Lloyd)
t You were about to tell me about
t Eve...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t You'd have been proud of her.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I'm sure. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t She was a revelation...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t To you, too?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t What do you mean?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(the ice begins to form)
t I mean, among other things, that it
t must have been a revelation to have
t your twenty-four-year-old character
t played by twenty-four-year-old
t actress...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t That's beside the point. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It's right to the point. Also that
t it must have sounded so new and
t fresh to you - so exciting to have
t the lines read as you wrote them!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Addison-!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t So full of meaning, fire and music!

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t You've been talking to that
t venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t - in this case, apparently, as
t trustworthy as the World Almanac!

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t You knew when you came in that the
t audition was over, that Eve was
t your understudy! Playing that
t childish game of cat and mouse...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Not mouse, never mouse! If anything
t - rat!

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t You have a genius for making
t barroom brawl out of a perfectly
t innocent misunderstanding at most! 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Perfectly innocent! Man have been
t hanged for less! I'm lied to,
t attacked behind my back, accused of
t reading your silly dialogue
t inaccurately - as if it were Holy
t Gospel!

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t I never said it was!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Then you listened as if someone
t else had written you play - whom
t did you have in mind? Sherwood?
t Arthur Miller? Beaumont and
t Fletcher? 

Max has edged his way to the stage. 

<b>tttMAX
</b>tt(from below)
t May I say a word?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t No!
tt(to Margo)
t What makes you think that either
t Miller or Sherwood would stand for
t the nonsense I take from you -
t you'd better stick to Beaumont and
t Fletcher! They've been dead for
t three hundred years! 

He stalks into the wings. Bill's reaction to the fight is
typical. He lights a cigarette, stretches out on the covered
bed. Eve stands frozen with fear. Margo yells after Lloyd
into the wings. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t And they're getting better
t performances today than they ever
t got! All playwrights should be dead
t for three hundred years!

Lloyd comes out of the door leading to the auditorium. The
battle goes on without a pause. As he yells back, he crosses
to Max at row A, center. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t That would solve none of their
t problems - because actresses never
t die! The stars never die and never
t change!

He starts up the aisle with Max. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You can change this star any time
t you want! For a new, fresh,
t exciting one fully equipped with
t fire and music! Any time you want -
t starting with tonight's
t performance!

Now it's Max who stops and shouts back at her.

<b>tttMAX
</b>t This is for lawyers to talk about,
t this concerns a run-of-the-play
t contract, and this you can't
t rewrite or ad lib!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(from the stage)
t Are you threatening me with legal
t action, Mr. Fabian?

<b>tttMAX
</b>t Are you breaking the contract?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Answer my question!

<b>tttMAX
</b>t Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying
t man. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I didn't hear you. 

<b>tttMAX 
</b>tt(yelling)
t I said I'm a dying man!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Not until the last drugstore has
t sold its last pill!

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(from the top of the
tt aisle)
t I shall never understand the weird
t process by which a body with a
t voice suddenly fancies itself a
t mind! Just when exactly does an
t actress decide they're her words
t she's saying and her thoughts she's
t expressing? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Usually at the point when she's got
t to rewrite and rethink them to keep
t the audience from leaving the
t theater!

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t It's about time the piano realized
t it has not written the concerto!

Max has already walked out unhappily. Lloyd now slams out.
Margo glares after him, then turns to Bill who smokes his
cigarette peacefully on the bed. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(quiet menace)
t And you, I take it, are the
t Paderewski who plays his concerto
t on me, the piano? 
tt(Bill waves his cigarette;
tt he's noncommittal)
t Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Who?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t The kid. Junior. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(looks lazily)
t Gone.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I must have frightened her away. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes
t you frighten me. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(paces up and down)
t Poor little flower. Just dropped
t her petals and folded her tent...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Don't mix your metaphors. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I mix what I like. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Okay. Mix. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I'm nothing but a body with a
t voice. No mind. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t What a body, what a voice. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t The ex-ship news' reporter. No
t body, no voice, all mind!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t The gong rang. The fight's over.
t Calm down. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I will not calm down!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Don't calm down. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You're being terribly tolerant,
t aren't you?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I'm trying terribly hard. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Well, you needn't. I will not be
t tolerated. And I will not be
t plotted against!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Here we go...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Such nonsense, what do you all take
t me for - little Nell from the
t country? Been my understudy for
t over a week without my knowing,
t carefully hidden no doubt-

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(sits up)
t Now don't get carried away-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(going right on)
t - shows up for an audition when
t everyone knew I'd be here... and
t gives a performance! Out of nowhere
t - gives a performance!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t You've been all through that with
t Lloyd-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t The playwright doesn't make the
t performance - and it doesn't just
t happen! And this one didn't - full
t of fire and music and whatnot, it
t was carefully rehearsed I have no
t doubt, over and over, full of those
t Bill Sampson touches!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I am sick and tired of these
t paranoiac outbursts!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Paranoiac!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I didn't know Eve Harrington was
t your understudy until half past two
t this afternoon!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with
t the rest of it...

She turns away. Bill grabs her, pulls her down on the bed. He
holds her down. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t No, I'll tell it to you! For the
t last time, I'll tell it to you.
t Because you've got to stop hurting
t yourself, and me, and the two of us
t by these paranoiac tantrums!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(struggling)
t That word again! I don't even know
t what it means...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(firmly)
t It's time you found out. I love
t you.
tt(Margo says "Ha!")
t I love you. You're a beautiful and
t intelligent woman-tt
tt(Margo says "A body with a
tt voice")
t - a beautiful and intelligent woman
t and a great actress-
tt(he waits; Margo says
tt nothing)
t - at the peak of her career. You
t have every reason for happiness-
tt(Margo says "Except
tt happiness")
t - every reason, but due to some
t strange, uncontrollable,
t unconscious drive you permit the
t slightest action of a kid-
tt(Margo sneers "Kid!")
t - kid like Eve to turn you into a
t hysterical, screaming harpy! Now
t once and for all, stop it!  

Margo seems quiet. He gets up. She sits up. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It's obvious you're not a woman.

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I've been aware of that for some
t time. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Well, I am. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I'll say. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Don't be condescending. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Come on, get up. I'll buy you a
t drink. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(with dignity)
t I admit I may have seen better
t days, but I am still not to be had
t for the price of a cocktail - like
t a salted peanut.

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(laughs)
t Margo, let's make peace.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t The terms are too high.
t Unconditional surrender. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Just being happy? Just stopping all
t this nonsense about Eve - and Eve
t and me?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It's not nonsense. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t But if I tell you it is - as I just
t did. Were you listening to me? 
tt(Margo nods)
t Isn't that enough?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I wish it were. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Then what would be enough?
tt(Margo doesn't answer)
t If we were married?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I wouldn't want you to marry me
t just to prove something. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t You've had so many reasons for not
t wanting to marry me... Margo, tell
t me what's behind all this.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I - I don't know, Bill. Just a
t feeling, I don't know...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I think you do know but you won't
t or can't tell me. 
tt(Margo doesn't say)
t I said before it was going to be my
t last try, and I meant it. I can't
t think of anything else to do. I
t wish I could. 
tt(a pause)
t We usually wind up screaming and
t throwing things as the curtain
t comes down. Then it comes up again
t and everything's fine. But not this
t time.
tt(he takes a breath)
t You know there isn't a playwright
t in the world who could make me
t believe this would happen between
t two adult people. Goodbye, Margo. 

No word from her. He starts away. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Bill...
tt(he stops)
t ... where are you going? To find
t Eve? 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(smiles grimly)
t That suddenly makes the whole thing
t believable.

He goes out. Margo, alone, sit for a moment sadly. Then she
begins to cry...

<b>INT. RICHARDS' STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
One large room, a small foyer with a door to the corridor. A
stair up one wall to a narrow balcony from which a couple of
bedroom open.

Karen is painting. Earnestly but badly. A still life of an
orange, an avocado, an eggplant and three bananas. 

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t On the day of the audition, my
t biggest worry was to keep a banana
t looking part of an eggplant... then
t Lloyd came home.
tt(in the b.g., Lloyd lets
tt himself in)
t It was right after his brawl with
t Margo...

Lloyd slams the door, flings his hat away, strides in,
peeling off muffler and overcoat. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Lloyd, what happened...?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Up to here! That's where I've got
t it - up to here! Of all the star
t ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Margo, again...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t And again and again! Two hours late
t for the audition, to begin with-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t That's on time for Margo. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Then a childish, heavy-handed
t routine about not knowing Eve was
t her understudy-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t It's just possible she didn't...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Of course she knew! For one thing,
t Addison told her how superbly Eve
t had read the part-!
tt(suddenly softening)
t Karen, let me tell you about Eve.
t She's got everything - a born
t actress. Sensitive, understanding,
t young, exciting, vibrant-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t - don't run out of adjectives,
t dear. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t - everything a playwright first
t thinks of wanting to write about...
t until his play becomes a vehicle
t for Miss Channing...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Margo hasn't done badly by it.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Margo. Margo's great. She knows it.
t That's the trouble.
t She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she
t wants, and who's to stop her? Who's
t to give her that boot in the rear
t she needs and deserves? 

He starts up the stairs to the bedroom. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(murmurs)
t It's going to be a cozy weekend.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(pauses)
t What is?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t We're driving out to the country
t tomorrow night. Just the four of
t us. Bill, Margo, you and I...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Well. We've spent weekends before
t with nobody talking...
tt(continues up stairs)
t ... just be sure to lock up all
t blunt instruments and throwable
t objects...

As he goes into one of the bedrooms, Karen sits thoughtfully
on a couch. She muses...

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t Newton - they say, thought of
t gravity by getting hit on the head
t by an apple. And the man who
t invented the steam engine, he was
t watching a tea-kettle... but not
t me. My Big Idea came to me just
t sitting on a couch...

She lies down, folds her hands behind her head. 

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t That boot in the rear to Margo.
t Heaven knows she had one coming.
t From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,
t Bill, Max, and so on - we'd all
t felt those size fives of hers often
t enough... but how? The answer was
t buzzing around me like a fly...

She sits up. She smiles. The smile fades...

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t I had it. But I let it go.
t Screaming and calling names is one
t thing - but this could mean...

She shakes her head, crosses to her easel, resumes work on
the bananas. She slows down, then stops. 

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t Why not? Why, I said to myself,
t not? It would all seem perfectly
t legitimate. And there were only two
t people in the world who would know.
t Also, the boot would land where it
t would do the most good for all
t concerned-

She puts the brush away and crosses to the phone which is by
Lloyd's work chair. As she crosses:

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t And after all, it was not more than
t a perfectly harmless joke which
t Margo, herself, would be the first
t to enjoy...

She looks in a leather phone book, pick up the phone and
dials. 

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t ... and no reason why she shouldn't
t be told about it - in time. 

There's an answer at the other end. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(into phone)
t Hello... will you call Miss Eve
t Harrington to the phone, please?
t Not at all... thank you.  

And as she waits we...

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
</b>
Open country. Preferably no houses in sight. Plenty of snow.
Lloyd's car drives along. 

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t It was a cold weekend - outside and
t in. Bill didn't come at all.
t Margo didn't know where he was and
t didn't care - she kept saying.
t Somehow we staggered through Sunday
t - and by the time we drive Margo to
t the station late Monday afternoon,
t she and Lloyd had thawed out to the
t extent of being civil to each
t other...

<b>INT. COUPE - NIGHT
</b>
Lloyd driving. All three in the front seat. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t What time is it?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t When you asked a minute ago it was
t five-forty-two. It is now five
t forty-three. When you ask a minute
t from no, it will be-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I just don't want Margo to miss her
t train. As it is, she'll barely make
t the theater...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the
t station in plenty of time...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t That little place just two hours
t form New York. It's on my list of
t things-I'll-never-understand. Like
t collecting shrunken Indian heads...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Of all people you should know what
t it means to want some peace and
t quiet-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Peace and quit is for libraries. 

The car swerves - suddenly and slightly. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Lloyd, be careful...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Just a little skid, that's all.
t This road's like glass. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Karen and I just don't want an
t accident-

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t I have no intention of having an
t accident!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It's not important whether you do.
t We are wearing long underwear. 

They all laugh. Suddenly the car slows and stops - with that
hissing sound that can mean only one thing - no gas. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Now what's this...?

He tries to start it again. No luck. He turns on the
dashboard lights. The gas gauge reads empty. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t But it can't be! We can't be out of
t gas! I filled it myself yesterday!
tt(to Karen)
t Wasn't it full when you drove to
t Brewster this morning?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(very low)
t I guess I didn't look. You know I
t don't pay attention to those
t things...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Incredible. 

Futilely, he runs the started again. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(crisply)
t How much time have we? 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Roughly ten minutes. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t How far to the station?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Three or four miles...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Any houses or farms around where we
t can borrow gas?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(looking)
t None in sight, there aren't many
t along this back road...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Not many car either, not much
t chance of a lift...

A moment of silence. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Well. No sense my just sitting
t here. I'm going to walk up about
t half a mile, just in case.

He starts out of the car. The cold comes in like a knife, the
women react. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t You'll break your neck on that ice. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(grins)
t What a way to die - trying to get
t an actress to the theater in time.
t Tell Max I want to be buried with
t royalties...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Don't joke about such things.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(quietly)
t How fortunate that I have an
t understudy so ready, so willing and
t so able to go on. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t The audience will want its money
t refunded, believe me. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed. 

Lloyd starts down the road. He slips once, recovers, waves
and keeps going. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t He always looks so pathetic
t whenever he does anything physical-

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It seems to me that walking, for
t most people, is not very dangerous. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(smiles)
t I just never think of Lloyd as
t anywhere but indoors and anything
t but sitting down. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Be brave. He'll come back - with or
t without gas. 

They tuck the fur car robe around them. A pause. Margo turns
on the radio... it's "Liebestraum."

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Do you want it on?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t It doesn't matter. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I detest cheap sentiment. 

She turns it off. Another pause. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Karen.
tt(Karen says "hm?")
t I haven't been pleasant this
t weekend. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t We've all seemed a little tense
t lately...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Come to think of it, I haven't been
t very pleasant for weeks. For that,
t I'm truly sorry. More than any two
t people I know, I don't want you and
t Lloyd to be angry with me...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t We're never deeply angry, we just
t get sore. The way you do. We know
t you too well...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t So many people - know me. I wish I
t did. I wish someone would tell be
t about me...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t You're Margo. Just - Margo. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t And what is that? Besides something
t spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.
t Besides something called
t temperament, which consists mostly
t of swooping about on a broomstick
t creaming at the top of my voice...
t infants behave the way I do, you
t know. They carry on and misbehave -
t they'd get drunk if they knew how -
t when they can't have what they
t want. When they feel unwanted and
t insecure - or unloved.   

There's a pause. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t What about Bill?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t What about Bill?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t He's in love with you. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t More than anything in this world, I
t love Bill. And I want Bill. I want
t him to want me. But me. Not Margo
t Channing. And if I can't tell they
t apart - how can he? 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Why should he - and why should you? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Bill's in love with Margo Channing.
t He's fought with her, worked with
t her, loved her... but ten years
t from now - Margo Channing will have
t ceased to exist. And what's left
t will be... what?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Margo. Bill is all of eight years
t younger than you. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Those years stretch as the years go
t on. I've seen it happen too often. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Not to you. Not to Bill.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Isn't that what they always say? 

She turns the radio on again. A piano nocturne...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I don't suppose the heater runs
t when the motor doesn't?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd
t fix it so people could just sit in
t a car and keep warm...

Margo nods, get some cigarettes out of her bag. She offers
one to Karen. They light up. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t About Eve. I've acted pretty
t disgracefully toward her, too. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Well...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Let's not fumble for excuses, not
t here and now with my hair down. At
t best, let's say I've been
t oversensitive to... well, to the
t fact that she's so young - so
t feminine and helpless. To so many
t things I want to be for Bill...
t funny business, a woman's career.
t The things you drop on your way up
t the ladder, so you can move faster.
t You forget you'll need them again
t when you go back to being a woman.
t That's one career all females have
t in common - whether we like it or
t not - being a woman.
t Sooner or later we've all got to
t work at it, no matter what other
t careers we've had or wanted... and,
t in the last analysis, nothing is
t any good unless you can look up
t just before dinner or turns around
t in bed - and there he is. Without
t that, you're not woman. You're
t something with a French provincial
t office or a book full of clippings -
t but you're not a woman...t
tt(she smiles at Karen)
t ... slow curtain. The end. 

A pause. There are tears in Karen's eyes. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Margo.
tt(she hesitates)
t Margo, I want you to know how sorry
t I am about this...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t About what? 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(indicating their
tt predicament)
t This. I can't tell you how sorry I
t am!

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Don't give it another thought, one
t of destiny's many pranks. After
t all, you didn't personally drain
t the gasoline out of the tank...

She snuggles down into her furs. Karen flashes an unhappy
look at her. She, too, snuggles down...

<b>EXT. THEATER ALLEY - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
The snow has been shoveled to either side of the alley,
making a lane. The performance is just over. 

Addison, his back to us, stands looking toward the stage
door. A few actors, on their way out. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t Eve, of course, was superb. Many of
t the audience understandably
t preferred to return another time to
t see Margo.
t But those who remained cheered
t loudly, lustily and long for Eve...
t how thoughtful of her to call and
t invite me - that afternoon...

He starts to walk toward the stage door. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t ... and what a happy coincidence
t that several representatives of
t other newspapers happened to be
t present. All of us - invited that
t afternoon to attend an understudy's
t performance...

He goes in the stage door. 

<b>INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
More activity than last time, the performance being just
over. Addison comes through the door, picks his way toward
Margo's dressing room. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t ... about which the management knew
t nothing until they were forced to
t ring up the curtain at nine
t o'clock. Coincidence. Also every
t indication of intrigue, skulduggery
t and fraud...  

The door tot he dressing room is open just a bit. Addison
pauses beside the door to listen. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(from within)
t ... you were better than all right,
t kid, you gave a performance, you
t rang a bell-

Addison uses his cane to swing the door open farther, so that
both he and WE can see as well as hear. 

<b>INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Bill faces Eve, who wears Margo's costume. She is a ravishing
sight. Her eyes shine up to his radiantly:

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(continuing)
t - little things here and there, it
t doesn't matter. You can be proud of
t yourself, you've got a right to be. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(quietly)
t Are you proud of me, Bill?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I'll admit I was worried when Max
t called. I had my doubts.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You shouldn't have had any doubts.

<b>tttBILL
</b>t - after all, the other day was one
t scene, the woods are full of one
t scene sensations. But you did it.
t With work and patience, you'll be a
t fine actress. If that's what you
t want to be. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Is that what you want me to be? 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I'm talking about you. And what you
t want. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t So am I. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t What have I got to do with it?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Everything. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(lightly)
t The names I've been called. But

t Good luck. 

He starts out. Addison ducks. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Don't run away, Bill. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(stops)
t From what would I be running?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You're always after truth - on the

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(curiously)
t I'm for it. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Then face it. I have. Since that
t first night - here - in the
t dressing room. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(smiles)
t When I told you what every young
t actress should know. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t When you told me that whatever I
t became, it would be because of you-

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Your make-up's a little heavy. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t - and for you. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(slowly)
t You're quite a girl. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You think?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you
t heard? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You hear all kinds of things. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I'm only human, rumors to the

</b>t Find out. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(deliberately)
t Only thing, what I go after, I want
t to go after. I don't want it to
t come after me.  

Tears come to Eve's eyes. She turns away slowly. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Don't cry. Just score it as an
t incomplete forward pass. 

He walks out. Addison ducks to avoid being seen. Eve glares
after Bill, tears the wig from her head, throws it on the
dressing table. Her glance is caught by a pair of scissors.
Swiftly, she snatches them up and in a sharp, vicious gesture
she slashes the wig. Addison knocks politely at the door. Eve
turns. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t May I come in?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Certainly, Mr. deWitt...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(entering)
t I expected to find this little room
t overcrowded, with a theater full of
t people at your feet...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I consider myself lucky they didn't
t throw things. 

She starts creaming her face, removing make-up.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Of course your performance was no
t surprise to me. After the other day
t I regarded it as no more than - a
t promised fulfilled.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You're more than kind. But it's
t still Miss Channing's performance.
t I'm just a carbon copy you read
t when you can't find the original...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t You're more than modest.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t It's not modesty. I just don't try
t to kid myself. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t A revolutionary approach to the
t Theater. However, if I may a
t suggestion...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Please do.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t I think the time has come for you
t to shed some of your humility. It
t is just as false not to blow your
t horn at all as it is to blow it too
t loudly... 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I don't think I've done anything to
t sound off about. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t We all come into this world with
t our little egos equipped with
t individual horns. If we don't blow
t them - who will?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Even so. One isolated pretty good
t performance by an understudy. It'll
t be forgotten tomorrow. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t It needn't be. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Even if I wanted to - as you say -
t be less humble, blow my own horn...
t how would I do it? I'm less than
t nobody. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t I am somebody. 

Eve rises. She eyes him steadily. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You certainly are. 

She goes into the bathroom. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Leave the door open a bit, so we
t can talk. 

Eve does so. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t After you change, if you're not
t busy elsewhere, we can have supper.

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(from the bathroom)
t I'd love to! Or should I pretend
t I'm busy?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(smiling)
t Let's have a minimum of pretending.
t I'll want to do a column about you-

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'm not enough for a paragraph. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t - perhaps more than one. There's so
t much I want to know. I've heard
t your story in bits and pieces...
t your home in Wisconsin, your tragic
t marriage, your financial attachment
t to Margo - it started in San
t Francisco, didn't it? 
tt(no answer; Addison
tt smiles)
t I say - your idolatry of Margo
t started in San Francisco, didn't
t it?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t That's right. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t San Francisco. An oasis of
t civilization in the California
t desert. Tell me, do you share my
t high opinion of San Francisco? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Yes. I do. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t And that memorable night when Margo
t first dazzled you from the stage -
t which theater was it in San
t Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(a slight pause)
t Yes. The Shubert. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(grins happily)
t A fine old theater, the Shubert.
t Full of tradition, untouched by the
t earthquake - so sorry - fire... by
t the way, what was your husband's
t name? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Eddie...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Eddie what?

Eve sticks her head and naked shoulder around the door. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'm about to go into the shower, I
t won't be able to hear you...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t I can wait. Where would you like to

</b>tt(staggered)
t You were there? At the play - last
t night?

<b>tttADDISON 
</b>tt(smiles)
t A happy coincidence.

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(quickly)
t We're having lunch with a movie
t talent scout. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t They certainly don't waste much
t time. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Nothing definite yet - it's just to
t have lunch. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t They'll be wasting this much of
t their time at any rate. Eve has no
t intention of going to Hollywood. 

He turns to Karen, changing the subject. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t From the smartness of your dress, I
t take it your luncheon companion is
t a lady?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(smiles)
t Margo. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Margo? Lunching in public?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t It's new Margo. But she's just as
t late as the old one. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t She may be later than you think...

As he speaks, he crosses to pick up an evening paper, opens
it as he comes back. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(handing it to her)
t Why not read my column to pass the
t time? The minutes will fly like
t hours...
tt(he takes Eve's arm)
t ... and now we must join our
t sunburned eager beaver. 

He goes up the stairs with Eve. Karen glances after them
curiously, then at the column.
It is headed: "Things I Promised Not To Tell" by Addison
deWitt. He expression becomes increasingly horrified. She
drops the paper and rushes out...

<b>INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Addison's column quivers in Margo's hand as she strides about
reading it. Karen sits miserably. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(declaiming)
t "... my hat which has, lo, these
t many seasons become more firmly
t rooted about my ears, is lifted to
t Miss Harrington. I am once more
t available for dancing in the
t streets and shouting from the
t housetops." ... I thought that one
t went out with Woollcott... 
tt(she skips part of the
tt column)
t Down here... here, listen to this-
t "... Miss Harrington had much to
t tell - and these columns shall
t report her faithfully - about the
t lamentable practice in our Theater
t of permitting, shall we say -
t mature - actresses to continue
t playing roles requiring a youth and
t vigor of which they retain but a
t dim memory-"

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I just can't believe it. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It get better! "- About the
t understandable reluctance on the
t part of our entrenched First Ladies
t of the Stage to encourage, shall we
t say - younger - actresses; about
t Miss Harrington's own long and
t unsupported struggle for
t opportunity-"

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I can't believe Eve said those
t things!

Margo crumples the paper as if it were Eve's neck. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(pacing)
t In this rat race, everybody's
t guilty till they're proved
t innocent! One of the differences
t between the Theater and
t civilization... 
tt(she hurls the paper away)
t ... what gets me is how all of
t those papers in town happened to
t catch that particular performance!

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(weakly)
t Lloyd says it's a publicity
t release...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t The little witch must have had
t Indians runners out snatching
t critics out of bars, steam rooms
t and museums or wherever they hole
t up... well, she won't get away with
t it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his
t poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer
t can't or won't do anything about
t it, I will personally stuff that
t pathetic little lost lamb down Mr.
t deWitt's ugly throat...

She pauses in midair to look at... Bill. He has come up the
stairs tow at a time, stands at the landing. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(quietly)
t I came as soon as I read that piece
t of filth. I ran all the way...

Margo suddenly starts to cry. She turns from him. Bill takes
her in his arms. He holds her...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Bill's here, baby. Everything's all
t right, now...

Margo says nothing, just hides in his embrace. He soothes
her, pets her... he looks over at Karen. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I guess at this point I'm what the
t French call 'de trop'...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(smiles)
t Maybe just a little around the
t edges.

Karen smiles back, waves, and goes out. 

<b>INT. RICHARDS' APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Karen's having some lunch. Lloyd, still in his robe, sits
opposite her having some coffee and a cigarette. A copy of
the interview before him. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(is saying)
t - it's Addison, from start to
t finish, it drips with his brand of
t venom... taking advantage of a kid
t like that, twisting her words,
t making her say what he wanted her
t to say-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Where'd you get all that
t information?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(put out his cigarette)
t Eve. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Eve?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t She's been to see me, as a matter
t of fact she left just before you
t came in - you just missed her...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t That was a pity...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(gets up)
t She wanted to explain about her
t interview, wanted to apologize to
t someone - and didn't dare face
t Margo...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I wonder why.

Lloyd wanders about - he seems to be searching for words, for
a position to maintain...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t She started to tell me all about it
t - and she couldn't finish, she
t cried so...

He's over by a window, his back to her. Karen eyes him
curiously, waiting for the payoff...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(finally)
t You know, I've been going over our
t financial condition - if you'll
t pardon the expression...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t That's quite a change of subject. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(walks again)
t What with taxes coming up - and
t since I'm a playwright and not an
t oil well operator - well, I've been
t thinking...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I'm trying hard to follow you.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t If - instead of waiting until next
t season to do 'Footsteps on the
t Ceiling', which is in pretty good
t shape - and if Margo can be talked
t into going on tour with 'Aged in
t Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...'
t into production right away...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I'm beginning to catch up. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t If we could cast it properly, that
t is...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(carefully)
t Maybe get some younger actress for
t the part? Someone who'd look the
t part as well as play it? 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(smiles)
t You've got to admit it would be a
t novelty. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve. 

A pause. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Eve did mention the play, you know.
t But just in passing - she's never
t ask to play a part like "Cora,"
t she'd never have the nerve...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Eve would ask Abbott to give her
t Costello. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t No, I got the idea myself - while
t she was talking to me...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t With gestures, of course. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(wistfully)
t For once, to write something and
t have it realized completely. For
t once, not to compromise-

Now Karen explodes. She rises.

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Lloyd Richards, you are not to
t consider giving that contemptible
t little worm the part of "Cora."

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Now just a minute-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Margo Channing has not been exactly
t a compromise all these years, half
t the playwrights in the world would
t give their shirts for that
t particular compromise!

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(angry)
t Now just a minute!

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty
t and ingratitude must be contagious!

Lloyd's full of anger and guilt. He snaps back.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t All this fuss and hysteria because
t an impulsive kid got carried away
t by excitement and the conniving of
t a professional manure slinger named
t deWitt! She apologized, didn't she? 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t On her knees, I have no doubt! Very
t touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic
t Arts!

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t That bitter cynicism of yours is
t something you've acquired since you
t left Radcliffe!

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t The cynicism you refer to, I
t acquired the day I discovered I was
t different from little boys!

The phone has been ringing. Lloyd snarls into it.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Hello!
tt(he quiets down)
t ... hi, Margo... no, not at all,
t Karen and I were just chatting...
t hmm?... why - why, yes, I'm sure we
t can and I'm sure we'd love to...
t right... 11:45ish. See you then...

He hangs up. He smiles - suddenly, there's peace.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Margo - and Bill - want us to meet
t them at the Cub Room tonight, after
t theater. For a bottle of wine. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(smiles)
t Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't
t be more surprised if she'd said
t Grant's Tomb. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t I'm glad Bill's back. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t They'd die without each other. 

A pause. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Darling, I didn't promise Eve
t anything. Just said I thought she'd
t be fine for the part, but there
t were some practical difficulties...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Such as?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(grins)
t You - for one. I told her you were
t set on Margo playing the part - and
t I certainly wouldn't make a change
t without your approval. 

Karen smiles happily.

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t That's fine. Fine and dandy. I'd
t enjoy nothing more. Just refer all
t of Miss Harrington's future
t requests to me...

<b>INT. CUB ROOM - STORK CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
Margo, Karen, Bill and Lloyd are ensconced happily at a table
in the rear of the room. A bottle of fine wine is being
poured. Their mood is equally bubbly. 

<b>tttBILL
</b>t The so-called art of acting is not
t one for which I have a particularly
t high regard...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Hear, hear...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t But you may quote me as follows.
t Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing
t gave a performance in your
t cockamamie play, the like of which
t I have never seen before and expect
t rarely to see again. Unquote. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t He does not exaggerate. I was good. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t You were great. 

As they look at each other, they reflect the understanding
that has hit them both at last. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t It's been quite a night. I
t understand that your understudy -
t Miss Harrington - has given her
t notice. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(eyes still on Bill)
t Too bad. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(eyes still on Margo)
t I'm broken up about it...

The wine has been poured by now. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t For some reason you can't just pick
t up champagne and drink it.
t Somebody's got to be very witty
t about a toast.t
tt(he lifts his glass)
t For instance...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(abruptly)
t I'm going to propose the toast.
t Without wit. With all my heart. 

Lloyd lowers his glass. There's a little pause. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t To Margo. To my bride-to-be.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Glory Hallelujah.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Well of all-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Margo!

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Drink.

They drink, then burst into a flurry of questions. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t When? When are you going to do it?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at
t ten-
tt(to Margo)
t - and you're going to be on time. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Yes, sir. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t City Hall, that's for prize
t fighters, and reporters - I see a
t cathedral, a bishop, banks of
t flowers...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t It's only for the license. There's
t a three-day wait - blood tests,
t things like that...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I'll marry you if it turns out you
t have no blood at all. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Three days, that's for the
t bourgeois - I see a midnight
t elopement, waking up a village
t person...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(to Margo)
t What are you going to wear?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Something simple. A fur coat over a
t nightgown...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t The point is - in the cathedral, a
t ball park or a penny arcade - we
t want to have you two beside us our
t nearest and dearest friends.

Lloyd fills all the glasses. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t There are very few moments in life
t as good as this. Let's remember it.
tt(he lifts his glass)
t To each of us and all of us...
t never have we been more close - may
t we never be farther apart.

They drink. A waiter approaches with a note. 

<b>tttWAITER
</b>t Mrs. Richards?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Yes?

<b>tttWAITER
</b>t For you. 

Karen stares at it curiously, then opens it. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Very discreet. A note right out in
t the open like that. Next time tell
t your lover to blow smoke rings - or
t tap a glass...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Lloyd, I want you to be big about
t this... the world is full of love
t tonight, no woman is safe...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(angrily)
t This beats all world's records for
t running, standing and jumping gall!

She whips the note to Margo, who reads it aloud. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(reading)
t "Please forgive me for butting into
t what seems such a happy occasion -
t but it's most important that I
t speak with you. Please" - it's
t underlined - "meet me in the
t Ladies' Room. Eve."

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t I understand she is now the
t understudy in there. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(looking about)
t Pass me the empty bottle. I may
t find her... why, look. There's
t Rasputin. 

Addison sits near the entrance, at a banquette table for two.
A crumpled napkin and a wine glass indicate Eve's place. He
nibbles daintily at some blini. 

Margo hails a passing captain.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Encore du champagne.

<b>tttCAPTAIN
</b>t More champagne, Miss Channing?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t That's what I said, bub.

<b>tttLLOYD 
</b>tt(to Karen)
t After all, maybe she just wants to
t apologize...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I have no possible interest in
t anything she'd have to say.

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t But what could she say? That's what
t fascinates me...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Go on - find out...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Karen, in all the years of our
t friendship, I have never let you go
t to the Ladies' Room alone. But now
t I must. I am busting to know what
t goes on in that feverish little
t brain waiting there...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Well... all right.

She gets up and goes. The CAMERA takes her past Addison's
table. He rises in polite surprise. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Karen! How nice...

She walks past him without a word. He smiles, looks toward
the group. He raises his glass in a toast. 

Margo responds to the toast by waving an onion with a grand
flourish, then eating it. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Very effective. But why take it out
t on me? 

He eats one in self-defense. 

<b>INT. LADIES' ROOM - STORK CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
Never having been, I can't say what it looks like. It is to
be hoped that there is an outer and inner room. We are
concerned with the outer. 

There is an attendant in charge, and a constantly changing
flow of ladies who pause to make various repairs. All cafe
society - including one young drunk stretched out under a
mink coat and a wet towel.

There are two chairs - or a banquette - in a corner. Eve
waits there. She rises as Karen approaches. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I was wondering whether you'd come
t at all..

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Don't get up.
tt(she smiles grimly)
t And don't act as if I were the
t queen mother. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I don't expect you to be pleasant. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I don't intend to be. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Can't we sit down? Just for a
t minute...

She sits down. Karen remains standing.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I've got a lot to say. And none of
t it is easy. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t There can't be very much-

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Oh, but there is-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t - and easy or not, I won't believe
t a word. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Why shouldn't you?
tt(a pause)
t Please sit down. 

Karen sits, reluctantly and rigidly.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You know, I've always considered
t myself a very clever girl. Smart.
t Good head on my shoulders, that
t sort of thing, never the wrong word
t at the wrong time... but then, I'd
t never met Addison deWitt.
tt(another pause)
t I remember once I had a tooth
t pulled. They gave me some
t anaesthetic - I don't remember the
t name - and it affected me in a
t strange way. I heard myself saying
t things I wasn't even thinking... as
t if my mind were someplace outside
t of my body, and couldn't control
t what I did or said-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(leading her on)
t - and you felt just like that
t talking to Addison. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(nods)
t In a way. You find yourself trying
t to say what you mean, but somehow
t the words change - and they become
t his words - and suddenly you're not
t saying what you mean, but what he
t means-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(sharply)
t Do you expect me to believe that
t you didn't say any of those things -
t that they were all Addison?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t No! I don't expect you to believe
t anything. Except that the
t responsibility is mine. And the
t disgrace. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Let's not get over-dramatic. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(smiles grimly)
t You've really got a low opinion of
t me, haven't you? We'll I'll give
t you some pleasant news. I've been
t told off in no uncertain terms all
t over town. Miss Channing should be
t happy to hear that. To know how
t loyal her friends are - how much
t more loyal they are than she had a
t right to expect me to be...

She turns away from Karen. Karen's embarrassed. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Eve... don't cry. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(turned away)
t I'm not crying.

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Tell me. How did your lunch turn
t out - with the man from Hollywood? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Some vague promises of a test,
t that's all - if a particular part
t should come along, one of those
t things-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t But the raves about your
t performance-

<b>tttEVE
</b>t - an understudy's performance. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Well. I think you're painting the
t picture a little darker than it is,
t really. If nothing else - and don't
t underestimate him - you have a
t powerful friend in Addison. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t He's not my friend. You were my
t friends...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t He can help you. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I wish I'd never met him, I'd like
t him to be dead... I want my friends
t back. 

This time she does cry. Softly, miserably. Karen looks about.
A pause. She puts an arm around Eve. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Eve. I - I don't think you meant to
t cause unhappiness. But you did.
t More to yourself, perhaps - as it
t turned out - than to anyone else...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'll never get over it. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(smiles)
t Yes, you will. You Theater people
t always do. Nothing is forever in
t the Theater. Love or hate, success
t or failure - whatever it is, it's
t here, it flares up and burns hot -
t and then it's gone. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I wish I could believe that. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Give yourself time. Don't worry too
t much about what people think,
t you're very young and very
t talented... 
tt(she gets up, her hand
tt still on Eve's shoulder)
t ... and, believe it or not, if
t there's anything I can do-

Eve has reached up to take Karen's hand. She holds it now, as
she turns slowly to face her. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t There is something. 

Karen stares down at her. Eve's eyes burn into tears. Karen
is caught, fascinated by them. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I think I know...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Something most important you can
t do. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t You want to play "Cora." You want
t me to tell Lloyd I think you should
t play it. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t If you told him so, he'd give me
t the part. He said he would. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t After all you've said... don't you
t know the part was written for
t Margo? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t It could have been - fifteen years
t ago. It's my part now. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t You talk just as Addison said you
t did. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t "Cora" is my part. You've got to
t tell Lloyd it's for me. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I don't think anything in the world
t could make me say that. 

She turns away again, but Eve's grip is like a vise. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Addison wants me to play it. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Over my dead body...

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(cold, relentless)
t That won't be necessary. Addison
t knows how Margo happen to miss that
t performance - how I happened to
t know she'd miss it in time to call
t him and notify every paper in
t town...
tt(Karen stops struggling)
t ... it's quite a story.
t Addison could make quite a thing of
t it - imagine how snide and vicious
t he could get and still write
t nothing but the truth. I had a time
t persuading him...
tt(she smiles, now)
t ... you'd better sit down. You look
t a bit wobbly. 
tt(Karen sits)
t If I play "Cora," Addison will
t never tell what happened - in or
t out of print. A simple exchange of
t favors. And I'm so happy I can do
t something for you - at long last...
tt(Karen covers her face
tt with her hands)
t Your friendship with Margo - your
t deep, close friendship - what would
t happen to it, do you think, if she
t knew the chap trick you'd played on
t her - for my benefit? And you and
t Lloyd - how long, even in the
t Theater, before people forgot what
t happened - and trusted you again?
tt(now Eve gets up)
t No... it would be so much easier on
t everyone concerned, if I were to
t play "Cora." And so much better
t theater, too...

Karen looks up slowly.

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t A part in a play. You'd do all that
t - just for a part in a play. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(smiles)
t I'd do much more - for a part that
t good.

She leaves. Karen is alone. 

<b>INT. CUB ROOM - NIGHT

Eve enters and slides in beside Addison. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Hungry?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Just some coffee. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(pours)
t I'm not surprised. After all that
t humble pie...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Nothing of the kind. Karen and I
t had a nice talk. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Heart to heart? Woman to woman?
t Including a casual reference to the
t part of "Cora" - and your hopes of
t playing it. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I discussed it very openly. I told
t her that I had spoken to Lloyd -
t and that he was interested. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t She mentioned, of course, that
t Margo expects to play the part?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Oddly enough - she didn't say a
t word about Margo. Just that she'll
t be happy to do what she can to see
t that I play the part.   

Addison puffs at his cigarette, bemused. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Just like that, eh?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Just like that. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(thoughtfully)
t Do you know, Eve - sometimes I
t think you keep things from me. 

Eve's feelings are hurt. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I don't think that's funny. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t It wasn't meant to be. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I confide in you and rely on you
t more than anyone I've ever known!
t To say a thing like that now -
t without any reason - when I need
t you more than ever...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(breaks in)
t I hope you mean what you say, Eve.
t I intend to hold you to it. 

Their eyes meet. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t We have a great deal in common, it
t seems to me...

They both look as Karen passes them on her way back to her
table. 

GROUP, as Karen joins them. Another bottle of champagne has
come and almost gone - there's a fine, cheery feeling among
them. Margo, in particular, is cheery. A pause. Karen downs a
glass of champagne.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t - well? What happened?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Nothing much. She apologized. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t With tears?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t With tears. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t But not right away? First the
t business of fighting them off, chin
t up, stout fella...

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Check. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Very classy stuff, lots of
t technique-

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t You mean - all this time - she'd
t done nothing but apologize? What'd
t you say? 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Not much.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Groom-
tt(Bill says "huh?")
t - may I have a wedding present? 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t What would you like? Texas?

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I want everybody to shut up about
t Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's
t all I want. Give Karen more wine...
tt(blissfully)
t ... never have I been so happy.
t Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub
t Room. What a lovely, clever name.
t Where the elite meet. Never have I
t seen so much elite - and all with
t their eyes on me. Waiting for me to
t crack that little gnome over the
t noggin with a bottle. But not
t tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve...
t there they go.  

They all look. 

ADDISON AND EVE, they get up and go without looking back.

GROUP, they watch for an instant. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little
t Miss Evil. But the evil that men do
t - how does it go, groom? Something
t about the good they leave behind -
t I played it once in rep in Wilkes
t Barre...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t You've got it backwards. Even for
t Wilkes-Barre.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You know why I forgive Eve? Because
t she's left good behind - the four
t of us, together like this, it's
t Eve's fault - I forgive her...

Karen's reactions are, of course, most important. Knowing
what she's done to Margo - wondering how to do what she must. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t ... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve
t did that, too. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t You know, she probably means well,
t after all...

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t She is a louse. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(to Lloyd)
t Never try to outguess Margo. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Groom.

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Yes, dear. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t You know what I'm going to be?

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t A cowboy. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t A married lady. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t With the paper to prove it. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I'm going to have a home. Not just
t a house I'm afraid to stay in...
t and a man to go with it. I'll look
t up at six o'clock - and there he'll
t be... remember, Karen? 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(quietly)
t I remember. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(to Bill)
t You'll be there, won't you. 

<b>tttBILL 
</b>tt(grins)
t Often enough to keep the franchise. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t A foursquare, upright, downright,
t forthright married lady... that's
t for me. And no more make believe!
t Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.
tt(Lloyd nods)
t I mean it, now. Grown-up women
t only, I might even play a mother -
t only one child, of course, not over
t eight...t
tt(they all smile)
t Lloyd, will you promise not to be
t angry with me? 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(smiles)
t That depends. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t I mean really, deeply angry...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t I don't think I could be.

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t Well. I don't want to play "Cora."

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(explodes)
t What?

Margo misinterprets her vehemence. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>tt(hastily)
t Now wait a minute, you're always so
t touchy about his plays, it isn't
t the part - it's a great part. And a
t fine play. But not for me anymore -
t not a foursquare, upright,
t downright, forthright married lady.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t What's your being married got to do
t with it? 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t It means I've finally got a life to
t live! I don't have to play parts
t I'm too old for - just because I've
t got nothing to do with my nights!
tt(then quietly)
t I know you've made plans. I'll make
t it up to you, believe me. I'll tour
t a year with this one, anything -
t only you do understand - don't you,
t Lloyd?

Lloyd never gets to answer. Because Karen, before anyone can
stop her, bursts into hysterical laughter...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t What's so funny?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Nothing...

<b>tttBILL 
</b>t Nothing?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Everything... everything's so
t funny... 

Margo removes the champagne glass from in front of Karen...

<b>FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT. THEATER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY
</b>
Karen is seated unobtrusively in a rear lower box. Lloyd sits
beside Max up front.

On stage, the play is "on its feet." Eve plays a dramatic
scene with a young man. They carry "sides" but do not consult
them.

As she speaks, Eve moves upstage, turns to face the young man
who is forced to turn his back to the auditorium. 

Bill calls a halt. He indicates to Eve that she was to have
remained downstage. 

Eve seems to be at a loss. She looks at Lloyd. 

Lloyd rises, says that he told her to make the change. 

Bill comes down to the footlights to tell him to stick to
writing, he'll do the directing. It mounts swiftly to a
screaming fight. Bill throws the script out into the
auditorium, takes his coat and stalks off.

Eve runs after him. Max retrieves the script. Lloyd remains
adamant. Karen has risen in dismay. 

Eve drags Bill back. Without looking at Lloyd, he takes the
script from Max, tells the actors to pick up where they left
off. 

Eve whispers to Lloyd from the stage. Lloyd smiles,
mollified, sits down again with Max. 

Karen walks up the side aisle, out of the theater...

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t Lloyd never got around, somehow -
t to asking me whether it was all
t right with me for Eve to play
t "Cora"... Bill, oddly enough,
t refused to direct the play at first
t - with Eve in it. Lloyd and Max
t finally won him over... Margo never
t came to a rehearsal, too much to do
t around the house, she said. I'd
t never known Bill and Lloyd to fight
t as bitterly and as often... and
t always over some business for Eve,
t or a move or the way she read a
t speech... but then I'd never known
t Lloyd to meddle as much with Bill's
t directing - as far as it affected
t Eve, that is... somehow, Eve kept
t them going. Bill stuck it out - and
t Lloyd seemed happy - and I thought
t it might be best if I skipped
t rehearsals from then on... 

<b>INT. RICHARDS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It is a lovely, large room. Two double beds, not alongside
each other and each with an extension phone beside it. In
addition to the door to the living room, there are two more -
to separate dressing rooms and baths. Lloyd is asleep. But
not Karen. She turns restlessly, finally sits up, lights a
cigarette. 

<b>tttKAREN'S VOICE
</b>t It seemed to me I had known always
t that it would happen - and here it
t was.
t It felt helpless, that helplessness
t you feel when you have no talent to
t offer - outside of loving your
t husband. How could I compete?
t Everything Lloyd loved about me, he
t had gotten used to long ago... 

The phone jangles suddenly, startling her. It wakes Lloyd up.
Karen answers. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Hello... who?... who's calling Mr.
t Richards?

<b>INT. ROOMING HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A girl, in a wrapper, at a wall phone. Her hair's in curlers.
She's frightened. 

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t My name wouldn't mean anything. I
t room across the hall from Eve
t Harrington, and she isn't well.
t She's been crying all night and
t hysterical, and she doesn't want a
t doctor...

RICHARDS' BEDROOM, Lloyd is sitting on the edge of the bed,
looking over...

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Who is it? What's it all about?

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(into phone)
t Did Miss Harrington tell you to
t call Mr. Richards?

Lloyd picks up his phone. 

<b>ROOMING HOUSE
</b>
<b>tttGIRL
</b>t No, Eve didn't say to call him, but
t I remembered I saw Mr. Richards
t with her a couple of times - and I
t thought they being such good
t friends...

<b>RICHARDS' BEDROOM
</b>
<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(into phone)
t Hello...hello, this is Lloyd
t Richards. Where is Eve? Let me talk
t to her-

<b>ROOMING HOUSE
</b>
<b>tttGIRL
</b>t She's up in her room, Mr. Richards.
t I really hate to bother you like
t this, but the way Eve's been
t feeling - I'm just worried sick
t what with her leaving for New Haven
t tomorrow, and everything...

<b>RICHARDS' BEDROOM
</b>
<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Tell her not to worry - tell her
t I'll be right over. 

<b>ROOMING HOUSE
</b>
<b>tttGIRL
</b>t I'll tell her, Mr. Richards.

She hangs up. As she moves from the phone, the ANGLE WIDENS
to disclose Eve at the foot of the stairs. The girls smile at
each other. They go upstairs, arm in arm. 

RICHARDS' BEDROOM, Karen is still in bed, phone still in her
hand. She hangs up, swings her legs out, puts out her
cigarette, gets into a robe. The open door and light of the
dressing room tell us where Lloyd is.

Karen walks to the door, starts to say something, changes her
mind. She crosses to a table, lights a fresh cigarette, comes
back to the door. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>tt(finally)
t Aren't you... broadening the duties
t of a playwright just a bit? Rushing
t off in the middle of the night 
t like a country doctor?

No answer except the opening and closing of drawers. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t What would you do if, instead of
t Eve, the leading man had called up
t to say her was hysterical?

Still no answer. Her tension increasing, Karen goes back to
the table, snubs out the fresh cigarette, then strides
swiftly back to the open door. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Lloyd, I don't want you to go!

Now Lloyd appears. He's in flannels, and a sport shirt with
no tie. He's confused and guilty and tortured.

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t I didn't think you would! It seems
t to me, Karen, that for some tine,
t now, you've been developing a deep
t unconcern for the feeling of human
t being in general-

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t I'm a human being, I've got some!

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>tt(goes right on)
t - and for my feelings in
t particular! For my play, my career -
t and now for a frightened,
t hysterical girl on the eve of her
t first night in the Theater!

He goes back into his room. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Have you forgotten about Eve? What
t she is, what she's done?

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t Old wives' tales, born of envy and
t jealousy! And a phobia against
t truth!

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Then tell me this isn't true! That
t your concern for your play and
t career is one thing - and that poor
t frightened hysterical girl another -
t and that your concern for her has
t nothing to do with either your play
t or your career!

Lloyd comes out wearing a jacket. He crosses to the door,
Karen after him.

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t That first, last, and foremost -
t your reason for going now is that
t you want to be with Eve! Three in
t the morning or high noon - play or
t no play - wife or no wife!
tt(Lloyd stops at the door)
t Isn't it true, Lloyd?

Lloyd goes out. Karen looks after him, despairing.

<b>EXT. SHUBERT THEATER - NEW HAVEN - DAY
</b>
The theater is but a few doors from the TAFT HOTEL. The
marquee announces a new play by Lloyd Richards, presented by
Max Fabian, opening tonight. 

Addison and Eve stand before the theater admiring her photo
on a lobby display. None of the actors are starred. 

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t To the Theater world - New Haven,
t Connecticut, is a short stretch of
t sidewalk between the Shubert
t Theater and the Taft Hotel,
t surrounded by what looks very much
t like a small city. It is here that
t managers have what are called out
t of-town openings - which are
t openings for New Yorkers who want
t to go out of town...

They start for the hotel - Eve's arm through Addison's.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t What a day - what a heavenly day...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t D-day.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Just like it. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t And tomorrow morning you will have
t won your beachhead on the shores of
t Immortality...

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(grins)
t Stop rehearsing your column...
t Isn't it strange, Addison?
t I thought I'd be panic-stricken,
t want to run away or something.
t Instead, I can't wait for tonight
t to come. To come and go...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Are you that sure of tomorrow?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Aren't you?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Frankly - yes.

They've arrived in front of the hotel. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t It'll be a night to remember. It'll
t bring to me everything I've ever
t wanted. The end of an old road -
t and the beginning of a new one...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t All paved with diamonds and gold?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You know me better than that. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Paved with what, then?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Stars.

She goes in. Addison follows her. 

<b>INT. CORRIDOR - TAFT HOTEL - DAY
</b>
Addison accompanies Eve along the corridor to her door.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t What time?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Almost four.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Plenty of time for a nice long nap -
t we rehearsed most of last night...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t You could sleep, too, couldn't you?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Why not?

They've arrived at her door. She opens it. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t The mark of a true killer.
tt(he holds out his hand)
t Sleep tight, rest easy - and come
t out fighting...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Why'd call me a killer?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Did I say killer? I meant champion.
t I get my boxing terms mixed. 

He turns to go. After a few steps-

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(calling)
t Addison-
tt(he pauses)
t - come on in for just a minute,
t won't you? There's... I've got
t something to tell you. 

Addison turns curiously, and enters behind her. 

<b>INT. EVE'S SUITE - TAFT HOTEL - DAY
</b>
Old-fashioned, dreary and small. The action starts in the
living room and continues to the bedroom. 

Addison closes the door, crosses to a comfortable chair. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Suites are for expense accounts.
t Aren't you being extravagant? 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd
t had a terrific row but Lloyd
t insisted... well. Can I fix you a
t drink?

She indicates a table elaborately stocked with liquor,
glasses, etc. Addison's eyebrows lift.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Also with the reluctant compliments
t of Max Fabian. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Lloyd. I never have any, and he
t likes a couple of drinks after we
t finish - so he sent it up...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Some plain soda.
tt(Eve starts to fix it)
t Lloyd must be expecting a record
t run in New Haven...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t That's for tonight. You're invited.
t We're having everyone up after the
t performance. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t We're?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Lloyd and I.

She carries the soda to him, sits on an ottoman at his feet. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t I find it odd that Karen isn't here
t for the opening, don't you?

He sips his soda and puts away, carefully avoiding a look at
Eve. As he looks back-

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Addison...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(blandly)
t She's always been so fantastically
t devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine
t that only death or destruction
t could keep her-

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(breaks in)
t Addison, just a few minutes ago.
t When I told you this would be a
t night to remember - that it would
t bring me everything I wanted-

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(nods)
t - something about an old road
t ending and a new one starting -
t paved with stars...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I didn't mean just the Theater.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t What else?

Eve gets up, crosses to look out over the Common.

<b>tttEVE 
</b>tt(her back to him)
t Lloyd Richards. He's going to leave
t Karen. We're going to be married.

For just a flash, Addison's eyes narrow coldly, viciously.
Then they crinkle into a bland smile. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the
t Theater, after all...

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(turns; shocked)
t It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd
t loves me, I love him!

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t I know nothing about Lloyd and his
t loves - I leave those to Louisa May
t Alcott. But I do know you.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'm in love with Lloyd!

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Lloyd Richards is commercially the
t most successful playwright in
t America-

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You have no right to say such
t things!

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t - and artistically, the most
t promising! Eve dear, this is
t Addison.

Eve drops her shocked manner like a cape. Her face lights up -
she crosses back to the ottoman. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Addison, won't it be just perfect?
t Lloyd and I - there's no telling
t how far we can go... he'll write
t great plays for me, I'll make them
t be great!
tt(as she sits)
t You're the only one I've told, the
t only one that knows except Lloyd
t and me...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t ... and Karen.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t She doesn't know. 

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t She knows enough not to be here.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t But not all of it - not that Lloyd
t and I are going to be married.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(thoughtfully)
t I see. And when was this unholy
t alliance joined?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t We decided the night before last,
t before we came up here...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(increasingly tense)
t Was the setting properly romantic -
t the lights on dimmers, gypsy
t violins off stage?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t The setting wasn't romantic, but
t Lloyd was. He woke me up at three
t in the morning, banging on my door -
t he couldn't sleep, he told me -
t he's left Karen, he couldn't go on
t with the play or anything else
t until I promised to marry him... we
t sat and talked until it was light.
t He never went home...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t You sat and talked until it was
t light...

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(meaningly)
t We sat and talked, Addison. I want
t a run of the play contract. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(quietly)
t There never was, there'll never be
t another like you. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(happily)
t Well, say something - anything!
t Congratulations, skol - good work,
t Eve!

Addison rises slowly, to his full height. As Eve watches him,
as her eyes go up to his, her smile fades-

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t What do you take me for?

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(cautiously)
t I don't know what I take you for
t anything...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(moving away)
t It is possible - even conceivable -
t that you've confused me with that
t gang of backward children you've
t been playing tricks on - that you
t have the same contempt for me that
t you have for them?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'm sure you mean something by
t that, Addison, but I don't know
t what...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Look closely, Eve, it's time you
t did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm
t nobody's fool. Least of all -
t yours.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I never intended you to be.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Yes, you did. You still do. 

Eve gets up, now. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I still don't know what you're
t getting at. Right now I want to
t take my nap. It's important that I-

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(breaks in)
t - it's important right now that we
t talk. Killer to killer.

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(wisely)
t Champion to champion. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Not with me, you're no champion.
t You're stepping way up in class. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Addison, will you please say what
t you have to say plainly and
t distinctly - and then get out so I
t can take my nap!

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Very well, plainly and distinctly.
t Although I consider it unnecessary -
t because you know as well as I, what
t I am about to say.
tt(they are now facing each
tt other)
t Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will
t not leave Karen for you. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t What do you mean by that?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t More plainly and more distinctly? I
t Have not come to New Haven to see
t the play, discuss your dreams, or
t to pull the ivy from the walls of
t Yale! I have come to tell you that
t you will not marry Lloyd - or
t anyone else - because I will not
t permit it. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t What have you got to do with it?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Everything. Because after tonight,
t you will belong to me. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I can't believe my ears...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t A dull cliche.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Belong - to you? That sound
t medieval - something out of an old
t melodrama...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t So does the history of the world
t for the past twenty years. I don't
t enjoy putting it as bluntly as
t this, frankly I had hoped that you
t would, somehow, have known - have
t taken it for granted that you and
<b>t I...
</b>
<b>tttEVE
</b>t ... taken it for granted? That you
t and I...

She smiles. Then she chuckles, then laughs. A mistake.
Addison slaps her sharply across the face. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(quietly)
t Remember as long as you live, never
t to laugh at me. At anything or
t anyone else - but never at me.

Eve eyes him coldly, goes to the door, throws it open.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Get out!

Addison walks to the door, closes it. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t You're too short for that gesture.
t Besides, it went out with Mrs.
t Fiske.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Then if you won't get out, I'll
t have you thrown out.

She goes to the phone. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Don't pick it up! Don't even put
t your hand on it...

She doesn't. Her back is to him. Addison smiles. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Something told you to do as I say,
t didn't it? That instinct is worth
t millions, you can't buy it, cherish
t it, Eve. When that alarm goes off,
t go to your battle stations...

He comes up behind her. Eve is tense and wary.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Your name is not Eve Harrington. It
t is Gertrude Slescynski.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t What of it?

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t It is true that your parents were
t poor. They still are. And they
t would like to know how you are -
t and where. They haven't heard from
t you for three years...

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(curtly)
t What of it?

She walks away. Addison eyes her keenly. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t A matter of opinion. Granted. It is
t also true that you worked in a
t brewery. But life in the brewery
t was apparently not as dull as you
t pictured it. As a matter of fact,
t it got less and less dull - until
t you boss's wife had your boss
t followed by detectives!

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(whirls on him)
t She never proved anything, not a
t thing!

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t But the $500 you got to get out of
t town brought you straight to New
t York - didn't it?

Eve turns and runs into the bedroom, slamming the door.
Addison opens it, follows close after her... he can be seen
in the bedroom, shouting at Eve who is offscene.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t That $500 brought you straight to
t New York - didn't it?

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Eve, trapped, in a corner of the room. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t She was a liar, she was a liar!

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Answer my question! Weren't you
t paid to get out of town?

Eve throws herself on the bed, face down, bursts in tears.
Addison, merciless, moves closer. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Fourth. There was no Eddie - no
t pilot - and you've never been
t married! That was not only a lie,
t but an insult to dead heroes and to
t the women who loved them...
tt(Eve, sobbing, puts her
tt hands over her ears;
tt Addison, closer, pulls
tt them away)
t ... Fifth. San Francisco has no
t Shubert Theater and North Shore,
t you've never been to San Francisco!
t That was a stupid lie, easy to
t expose, not worthy of you...

Eve twists to look up at him, her eyes streaming.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I had to get in, to meet Margo! I
t had to say something, be somebody,
t make her like me!

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t She did like you, she helped and
t trusted you! You paid her back by
t trying to take Bill away!

<b>tttEVE
</b>t That's not true!

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t I was there, I saw you and heard
t you through the dressing room door!

Eve turns face down again, sobbing miserably.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t You used my name and my column to
t blackmail Karen into getting you
t the part of "Cora" - and you lied
t to me about it!

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(into the bed)
t No-no-no...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t I had lunch with Karen not three
t hours ago. As always with women who
t want to find out things, she told
t more than she learned...
tt(he lets go of her hands)
t ... do you want to change your
t story about Lloyd beating at your
t door the other night?

Eve covers her face with her hands. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Please... please...

Addison get off the bed, looks down at her. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t That I should want you at all
t suddenly strikes me as the height
t of improbability. But that, in
t itself, is probably the reason.
t You're an improbable person, Eve,
t and so am I. We have that in
t common. Also a contempt for
t humanity, an inability to love or
t be loved, insatiable ambition - and
t talent. We deserve each other. Are
t you listening to me?

Eve lies listlessly now, her tear-stained cheek against the
coverlet. She nods.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Then say so. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Yes, Addison.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t And you realize - you agree how
t completely you belong to me?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Yes, Addison.

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Take your nap, now. And good luck
t for tonight.

He starts out. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(tonelessly)
t I won't play tonight.
tt(Addison pauses)
t I couldn't. Not possibly. I
t couldn't go on...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(smiles)
t Couldn't go on? You'll give the
t performance of your life.

He goes out. The CAMERA REMAINS on Eve's forlorn, tear
stained face. Her eyes close... she goes to sleep.

<b>INT. DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT
</b>
THE STOPPED ACTION of Eve reaching out for the award. The
applause and bulb-popping still going on.

<b>tttADDISON'S VOICE
</b>t And she gave the performance of her
t life. And it was a night to
t remember, that night...

THE ACTION picks up where it left off. Eve accepts the award
from the Aged Actor, kisses him tenderly, folds the award to
her bosom and waits for quiet.

She speaks with assurance, yet modestly and humbly.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Honored members of Sarah Siddons
t Society, distinguished guests,
t ladies and gentlemen: What is there
t for me to say? Everything wise and
t witty has long since been said - by
t minds more mature and talents far
t greater than mine. For me to thank
t you as equals would be presumptuous
t - I am an apprentice in the Theater
t and have much to learn from you
t all. I can say only that I am proud
t and happy and that I regard this
t great honor not so much as an award
t for what I have achieved, but as a
t standard to hold against what I
t have yet to accomplish.
tt(applause)
t And further, I regard it as
t bestowed upon me only in part. The
t larger share belongs to my friends
t in the Theater - and to the Theater
t itself, which has given me all I
t have. In good conscience, I must
t give credit where credit is due. To
t Max Fabian-

MAX sits erect, beaming proudly.

<b>tttEVE'S VOICE
</b>t - dear Max. Dear, sentimental,
t generous, courageous Max Fabian -
t who took a chance on an unknown,
t untried, amateur...

EVE, after applause greets Max. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t And to my first friend in the
t Theater - whose kindness and
t graciousness I shall never
t forget... Karen - Mrs. Lloyd
t Richards...

KAREN resumes her doodling as applause breaks out for her...

<b>tttEVE'S VOICE
</b>t ... and it was Karen who first
t brought me to one whom I had always
t idolized - and who was to become my
t benefactor and champion. A great
t actress and a great woman - Margo
t Channing.

MARGO, part of Eve's tribute has been over her CLOSE-UP. She
smiles grimly in reaction to the applause.

EVE looks to her right, waits for the applause to die. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t My director - who demanded always a
t little more than my talent could
t provide-

BILL, seated at the speakers' table. He has his award before
him - a smaller one. He puts out a cigarette expressionlessly
as the applause breaks out. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t - but who taught me patiently and
t well... Bill Sampson.

LLOYD sits beside Bill. He, too, has a smaller award. As Eve
speaks, he throws her a brief glance. 

<b>tttEVE'S VOICE
</b>t And one, without whose great play
t and faith in me, this night would
t never have been. How can I repay
t Lloyd Richards?

EVE waits for the applause to die. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Hoe can I repay the many others? So
t many, that I couldn't possibly name
t them all...

ADDISON smiles approvingly. 

<b>tttEVE'S VOICE
</b>t ... whose help, guidance and advice
t have made this, the happiest night
t of my life, possible. 

EVE stares at the award for an instant, as if fighting for
self-control.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Although I am going to Hollywood
t next week to make a film - do not
t think for a moment that I am
t leaving you. How could I? For my
t heart is here in the Theater - and
t three thousand miles are too far to
t be away from one's heart.
t I'll be back to claim it - and
t soon. That is, if you want me back.

Another storm of applause. Much ad lib shouting as Bill and
Lloyd are summoned to pose beside her for more pictures.
People are thronging out. The Aged Actor shouts above the
hubbub...

<b>tttAGED ACTOR
</b>t A good night to all - and to all a
t good night!

Eve disengages herself from the photographers, makes her way
toward Addison's table... Bill and Lloyd follow. CAMERA
FOLLOWS Lloyd to Karen. They kiss. He gives her the award. 

<b>tttLLOYD
</b>t For services rendered - beyond the
t whatever-it-is-of-duty, darling.

Max bustles into the SHOT.

<b>tttMAX
</b>t Come on! I'm the host, I gotta get
t home before the guests start
t stealing the liquor...

She and Lloyd follow Max. Addison and Eve are on their way.
Lloyd goes right by. Karen pauses at Eve.

<b>tttKAREN
</b>t Congratulations, Eve. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Thank you, Karen.

Karen goes. Eve is being constantly congratulated. Some ad
lib about seeing her at Max's party...

<b>tttMAX
</b>tt(to Addison)
t I'm giving her a very high-class
t party. It ain't like a rehearsal,
t she don't have to be late. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t As soon as the peasants stop pawing
t her. 

Max hurries out. Margo and Bill step into the SHOT. Eve turns
from a well-wisher to face her. 

<b>tttMARGO
</b>t ... nice speech, Eve. But I
t wouldn't worry too much about your
t heart. You can always put that
t award where your heart ought to be. 

Eve looks at her wordlessly. Margo and Bill leave. Addison
and Eve are alone. The tables about them are empty. Suddenly,
her face becomes expressionless, her eyes dull... she glances
at the table.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I don't suppose there's a drink
t left...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t You can have one at Max's. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(sits)
t I don't think I'm going. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(sighs)
t Why not?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Because I don't want to. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(patiently)
t Max has gone to a great deal of
t trouble, it's going to be an
t elaborate party, and it's for you. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t No, it's not.
tt(she holds up the award)
t It's for this. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t It's the same thing, isn't it?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Exactly.
tt(she gives him the award)
t Here. Take it to the party instead
t of me. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t You're being childish.

A well-wisher rushes up to Eve with an "Eve, darling, I'm so
happy!" Eve rises, thanks her graciously. Then she pulls her
wrap over her shoulder.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I'm tired. I want to go home. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>tt(curtly)
t Very well. I shall drop you and go
t on to the party. I have no
t intention of missing it...

They exit from the room, now empty of everything but tables,
waiters, and the usual banquet debris. 

<b>EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT
</b>
Eve gets out of taxi in front of a fashionable apartment
hotel. She doesn't say good night to Addison, she enters the
hotel as the cab drives off. She hasn't the award with her. 

<b>INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Smart, but not gaudy. Eve crosses from the elevator to her
apartment. She lets herself in. 

<b>INT. EVE'S HOTEL APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
A small foyer, from which one door leads to the leaving room,
another to the bedroom. The bedroom and living room do not
connect except through the foyer. 

All the lights are out. Eve turns them on in the foyer, the
same as she enters the bedroom. There are some new trunks, in
various stages of being packed. Eve tosses her wrap on the
bed, goes through the foyer to the living room.

She turns on the light in the living room. CAMERA FOLLOWS her
to a smart small bar where she fixes a stiff drink. As she
turns from the bar, she stares - starts in fright - and drops
the drink. 

A young girl, asleep in a chair, wakes with a jump. She
stares at Eve, horror-stricken. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Who are you?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t Miss Harrington...

<b>tttEVE
</b>t What are you doing here?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t I - I guess I fell asleep.

Eve starts for the phone. The girl rises in panic. 

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t Please don't have me arrested,
t please! I didn't steal anything -
t you can search me!

<b>tttEVE
</b>tt(pauses)
t How did you get in here?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t I hid outside in the hall till the
t maid came to turn down your bed.
t She must've forgot something and
t when she went to get it, she left
t the door open. I sneaked in and hid
t till she finished. Then I just
t looked around - and pretty soon I
t was afraid somebody'd notice the
t lights were on so I turned them off
t - and then I guess, I fell asleep.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t You were just looking around...

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t That's all. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t What for?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t You probably won't believe me. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Probably not. 

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t It was for my report. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t What report? To whom?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t About how you live, what kind of
t clothes you wear - what kind of
t perfume and books - things like
t that. You know the Eve Harrington
t clubs - that they've got in most of
t the girls' high schools?

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I've heard of them.

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t Ours was one of the first. Erasmus
t Hall. I'm the president. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn,
t isn't it?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t Lots of actresses come from
t Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan
t Hayward - of course, they're just
t movie stars. 

Eve makes no comment. She lies wearily on the couch. 

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t You're going to Hollywood - aren't
t you?
tt(Eve murmurs "uh-huh")
t From the trunks you're packing, you
t must be going to stay a long time.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t I might. 

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t That spilled drink is going to ruin
t your carper. 

She crosses to it. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t The maid'll fix it in the morning. 

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t I'll just pick up the broken glass.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t Don't bother. 

The girl puts the broken glass on the bar. She starts to mix
Eve a fresh drink. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t How'd you get all the way up here
t from Brooklyn?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t Subway.

<b>tttEVE
</b>t How long does it take?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t With changing and everything, a
t little over an hour.

She carries the drink over to Eve. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t It's after one now. You won't get
t home till all hours.

<b>tttGIRL
</b>tt(smiles)
t I don't care if I never get home. 

The door buzzer sounds. 

<b>tttEVE
</b>t That's the door. 

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t You rest. I'll get it...

She goes to the door, opens it. Addison stands there, the
Sarah Siddons Award in his hands. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Hello, there. Who are you?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>tt(shyly)
t Miss Harrington's resting, Mr.
t deWitt. She asked me to see who it
t is...

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t We won't disturb her rest. It seems
t she left her award in the taxicab.
t Will you give it to her?

She holds it as if it were the Promised Land. Addison smiles
faintly. He knows the look. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t How do you know my name?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t It's a very famous name, Mr.
t deWitt. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t And what is your name?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>t Phoebe. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Phoebe?

<b>tttGIRL
</b>tt(stubbornly)
t I call myself Phoebe. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you
t want some day to have an award like
t that of your own? 

Phoebe lifts her eyes to him. 

<b>tttPHOEBE
</b>t More than anything else in the
t world. 

Addison pats her shoulder lightly. 

<b>tttADDISON
</b>t Then you must Miss Harrington how
t to get one. Miss Harrington knows
t all about it...

Phoebe smiles shyly. Addison closes the door. Phoebe stares
down at the award for an instant. 

<b>tttEVE'S VOICE
</b>tt(sleepy; from the living
tt room)
t Who was it?

<b>tttPHOEBE
</b>t Just a taxi driver, Miss
t Harrington. You left the award in
t his cab and he brought it back...

<b>tttEVE'S VOICE
</b>t Oh. Put it on one of the trunks,
t will you? I want to pack it...

<b>tttPHOEBE
</b>t Sure, Miss Harrington...

She takes the award into the bedroom, sets it on a trunk. As
she starts out, she sees Eve's fabulous wrap on the bed. She
listens. Then, quietly, she puts on the wrap and picks up the
award. 

Slowly, she walks to a large three-mirrored cheval. With
grace and infinite dignity she holds the award to her, and
bows again and again... as if to the applause of a multitude.
