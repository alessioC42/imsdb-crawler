<b>ALIEN III
</b>

<b>THE SCREEN IS BLACK
</b>
A pinpoint of light appears.
Red.  An ember. 
Unseen BELLOWS blow.

<b>GLASS FURNACE
</b>
The embers glow.  Flame.
The fire GROWS.

<b>A RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS
</b>
Heated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. 
White Hot.

<b>GLASS FACTORY
</b>
Flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls.  
Coarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of
intense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood,
it too now old and dry.

<b>SMOKE
</b>
Billows up the walls.
Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of
the vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures --

<b>A MAN
</b>
On a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. 
His clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. 
He is a MONK.

LOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open.
The smoke begins to escape.

The Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch --
Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX --
a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope.
He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by --

<b>MORE MONKS
</b>
By their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil.
They blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished
pieces.  The old way.

<b>ONE PARTICULAR MONK
</b>
Black skinned, early fifties.
Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but
he is watching something else.  It moves him to song.
Lilting tenor lifts high into the air.
This is BROTHER KYLE.

<b>tttBROTHER KYLE
</b>tWell would he guess the ascending of the star,
tWherein his patient's fortunes settled were.
tHe knew the course of every malady,
tWere it of cold or heat or moist or dry.
tBrother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.

We see the object of his song:

<b>BROTHER JOHN
</b>
Not yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.
The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.
A good face, nonetheless.
He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar.
Next to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of
him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.

<b>tt       BROTHER KYLE
</b>ttTend you quickly he will,
ttwith bottles from a shelf.
ttBut heals not, so easily,
ttThe ills which plague himself.

Brother John stops stirring.

<b>tt      BROTHER JOHN
</b>tt   (to Kyle)
ttEnough.

He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the
Burned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool
mixture contacts the injured area.  

<b>tt     BROTHER JOHN
</b>tt  (to the burned Monk)
ttRelax.
tt  (to Kyle)
ttPut those lungs of yours to better
ttuse.

<b>tt     BROTHER KYLE
</b>ttYes, Doc Tor.

Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass --
a BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end.

He rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of 
iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. 

John wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn.

<b>ttt     JOHN
</b>ttKeep this from getting wet.  Go home at
ttlate afternoon mealtime and don't come
ttback to work today --

<b>tt     BURNED MONK
</b>ttBut John --

<b>ttt     JOHN
</b>ttI'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today.
ttYou're lucky you only burned yourself on
ttthe side of the furnace.  If some of that
ttglass had gotten on your arm --

He points to the top of his forearm.

<b>t   t            JOHN
</b>tt-- it would've burned clean through to
ttthe other side.

He mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm.
The Burned Monk shudders at the thought.  

BELLS toll.
<b> 
</b><b>tt            JOHN
</b>ttThat's late afternoon.  Now get on.

<b>tttBURNED MONK
</b>ttThank you, John.  I --

<b>ttt   JOHN
</b>ttYou're welcome.  Go!

The Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest.
John gathers his mortar, pestle, and extra bandages into a
burlap sack.  Kyle comes over.

<b>ttt  KYLE
</b>ttGood work.

<b>ttt  JOHN
</b>ttAll right, but I'm no Father Anselm.

<b>  ttt  KYLE
</b>ttYou're yourself, that's better...

Kyle pushes him through the door...

<b>INTO THE HALLWAY
</b>
The Hallway is alive with cassocked monks.
Their LOW CHANTING reverberates throughout the building.
The wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights.
This is obviously a MEDIEVAL MONASTERY...

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttThe Abbot will be pleased.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttDon't.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttDon't what?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttPlease don't tell him.  At least until
ttI know if there's an infection.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttYou want to be the Abbey's Physician,
ttand you haven't learned the first rule:
ttDon't worry about the patient.

John's face drops.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttI shouldn't have. Sorry.  Look, I know
tthow you must --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou don't, but thanks anyway.

<b>AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY
</b>
A wide stairwell.  A constant stream of monks all moving down
the stairs.  Coming from floors above.  Headed for lunch.
Kyle starts down.  John starts up --

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttNot coming down?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI have someone waiting for me.

Kyle disappears into the crowd.
John moves up...

<b>THE STAIRWAY
</b>
A river of brown cassocks running downstream.
John is the only one moving against the flow.
He exits the stairwell --

<b>ONE FLOOR UP
</b>
A narrow corridor lined with doorways.
John moves to one in particular.
He doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob.
This is his room.
He opens the door --

<b>IN BROTHER JOHN'S ROOM
</b>
An old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock
which is now serving as its bed.
At the sight of John it stands.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttCome on, Mattias.

The dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall.
Monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. 
Past another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down.

<b>INT. LIBRARY
</b>
A vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches
between aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves
jammed to capacity with BOOKS of all shapes and sizes.  Millions
of books, from the looks of it.
From each book hangs a long CHAIN, long enough to allow the 
book to be carried only as far as the nearest table.

<b>A CORPULENT MONK - BROTHER PHILIP
</b>
In his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his
position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large
KEY hanging from his belt.  He watches the few stragglers return
their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door,
then rises and joins them...

<b>IN THE CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY
</b>
John leans against the wall as Philip exits.
Mattias is nowhere to be seen. 

<b>tttPHILIP
</b>ttBrother John.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBrother Philip.

<b>tttPHILIP
</b>ttFeeding the mind instead of the body
ttagain?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttMy training has taught me to feed what's
tthungry.

Philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.

<b>tttPHILIP
</b>ttAs did mine.  As long as you're alone.
ttEnjoy yourself -- and remember, no book
ttleaves the library.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHow could I forget?  Have a good meal...

John watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs.
When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock
to reveal Mattias.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttPerfect.

They move into the library...

<b>THE MEDIEVAL SECTION
</b>
The oldest books.
John moves to the stacks.
Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits.
This is his regular place.

<b>AT THE SHELVES
</b>
John stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome.
He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding.
A smile plays across his lips.

He carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so
there is slack in the chain.
Sits on the bench next to the dog.
Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...

tttJohn
t    t    (reading)
ttIn the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
ttGerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
ttthe Abbot and my sixty fellow monks --

<b>tttVOICE O/S
</b>ttSometimes, I think you'd like that.

John turns to find --

<b>THE ABBOT
</b>
Leader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger.
His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden
CHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table.

John closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.

tttJohn
ttAbbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttMind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed
tthim on the way up.  He said you'd come 
ttin alone.  I knew better.

He scratches the back of Mattias' neck.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttHello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?

The dog snuffles in response.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYou know what Philip says about Mattias'
tthair and his breathing.  You'll have to 
tttake him out of here.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHe likes when I read to him and -- I 
ttcan't --

John looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels
almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot.  
The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>tt    (smiles)
ttSomeone must have left this one unlocked.
ttTake the book with you.

He hands the key to John, who is shocked --
this is a great honor.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttFather, I --?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttKyle tells me you did a good job at
ttthe glassworks today.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI'll reserve judgement until the patient
ttlives.

John crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book.
He returns the key.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttIt will get easier.  Father Anselm was...
ttan unexpected loss.  You'll do fine.

The Abbot walks towards the door...

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttJust have it back before the end of lunch.
ttOh -- And I didn't see you in here.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThank you.
tt      (to Mattias)
ttLet's go upstairs, boy.

John takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase.
Mattias at his heels.
Goes UP --

<b>INTO THE BELL TOWER
</b>
The mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs
cast scary shadows.
A doorway leads to --

<b>THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY
</b>
Thick with sandy dust.  The wood shows through thin patches.  
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey
is actually --

<b>THE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT
</b>
The door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID!
The curving horizon broken only by the very top of the
Abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below.  
SMOKE curls from vents set into the surface.
Sunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS.

This is ARCEON.
An manmade orbiter.
A shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter.
Constructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable
level within finished in whatever material suits its end user.

This orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been
sheathed in wood.

<b>JOHN
</b>
Walks to the shore of an inland SEA.
Sits on a bare patch of wood.  Looks up.
His eyes grow accustomed to --

<b>THE NIGHT SKY - JOHN POV
</b>
Freckled with tiny dots of light.
Stars.  Spread across the inky void.
Bathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow.

John smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. 
The atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. 
He opens the book.
Reads aloud --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttIn the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
ttGerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
ttthe Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day
ttby day, one by one, until I am the only 
ttone left.  I stayed as long as I could bear 
ttit, then with my dog -- 

Mattias lifts his ears at this part.  His favorite part.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>tt- fled.  I have put this to parchment lest
ttthis pestilence - this Black Death - 
ttstay my hand.
ttt(beat)
ttThis was finished by another hand...

John closes the book.  Something catches his eye --
Something among the myriad points of light in the sky.
Millions of miles away:

<b>ONE OF THE STARS
</b>
Brighter than the rest.  MOVING.
Fast enough to leave a faint trail.
Across the stars.  And down...
A comet.

John stands.  Watches --

<b>THE STAR
</b>
Growing brighter.
Drawing nearer.

<b>JOHN
</b>
Joined by three other MONKS.
They are older than he.
The Four men watch the sky...

<b>THE STAR
</b>
Brighter still.  Closer.

<b>MORE MONKS
</b>
Two dozen.  A hundred.
They come up through the planet's surface.
Out of wooden trap doors.  Join the others.
Days pass.
Now three hundred.
Necks bowed back.
Mouths agape.
A SUBTITLE identifies...

<b>tttRELIGIOUS COLONY ARCEON
</b><b>ttt-----------------------
</b>tttPOPULATION: 350 Exiles
tttCRIME:  Political Heresy

<b>THE STAR
</b>
Fills the sky.
Burns brighter still as it hits the planetoid's atmosphere.

<b>ON THE SURFACE OF ARCEON
</b>
Hundreds of Monks shield their eyes as the ship -- the star --
ROARS over their heads.  Trailing FIRE --

John holds up his hands - to touch a star --
Skin BLISTERS as it passes over him,
He turns and watches as it --
Arcs downward --

<b>INTO THE SEA
</b>
<b>WHOMP- SSSSSSSSSS --!!
</b>PLUMES of steam rise into the air.
The water boils.  Fish bob to the surface.  Bloated.  Dead.

<b>JOHN
</b>
Is the first to hit the shore.
Small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake.
His coracle is the first into the water.
The others running up behind him.
He cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning.

<b>ON THE SEA - DAWN
</b>
The sun cracks over the black water.
John's hands move the rough wooden oars.
Blistered palm opens.
BLOOD flows.
He tears off a piece of his cassock --
Rips it with his teeth --
Wraps the bloody hand.
Rows.

<b>THE STAR
</b>
Ship.  Star Ship.
Sulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water.
White metal skin blackened by the heat.

<b>JOHN
</b>
Rows right into it.
His coracle pitches in the choppy surf.  
He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface.
Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH.
Looks around for a knob, a handle --

<b>NEXT TO THE HATCH
</b>
A small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote
urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny
metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat.
Then quickly pulls it down...
<b>WUORRRSH -!
</b>Hull door OPENS.

The doorway is a black maw.
John crosses himself.
Begins to lower his foot into the hatch --

<b>tttKYLE O/S
</b>ttWatch it!

He almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back --

<b>THE OTHER MONKS
</b>
Are rapidly approaching.
Kyle gestulates wildly --

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttJohn!  Wait -- !  Don't go in!

John turns back to the open hatch.
Machine recirculated air flows out.
He feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool.
Cool, and artificial.  It calls to him.
He steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness --

<b>WHOOSH-CLANG -!
</b>The door closes behind him.

<b>INT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY
</b>
Dark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to
the darkness.  He sees:

<b>NEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE
</b>
A glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its
base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the
head of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt
warning -- is audible...

<b>tttCOMPUTER VOICE
</b>ttt(sotto)
ttSeal broken...seal broken...

John finds himself moving towards the tube...
Looks through the broken lid:

<b>IN THE TUBE
</b>
There is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white
interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown.
Whatever happened here happened a while ago.
Rust colored drips trail down to --

<b>THE FLOOR
</b>
Drag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of
Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn.
Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found.

<b>JOHN
</b>
Looks back towards the door.
Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights
back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone
in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- 
Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and
glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- 

<b>LIGHTS
</b>
Pressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights.
Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky.

It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and
never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear
now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....

<b>ON A PALE GREEN SCREEN
</b>
LED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07
A legand identifies "Elapsed since separation."
He moves on...

<b>A VIDEO MONITOR
</b>
Through scanning bars of snow, an image:
A WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her.
The Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl.
Protective. Maternal.

The Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself.
A tape loop, although John has no idea what that is.

<b>tttWOMAN
</b>tt...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS
ttSulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead.
ttShip's sensors have interrupted the hyper
ttsleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has
tthatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed.
ttXenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt 
ttand I are taking pod four.  The Crew of...

The WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear.
He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship,
following the trail of blinking instruments --
Drawn to touch a button.  Click...

<b>SOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER!
</b>Just an oxygen mask.

John feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the
plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. 
His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and --

<b>HSSSSSSSSS -!
</b>A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe --
John SHOUTS and back up into --

<b>ANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!!
</b>
Next to Newt's now empty tube.
Humming gently.  Still operational.
John approaches it cautiously.
He can make out the occupant through the lid...

<b>A WOMAN
</b>
The woman from the screen.  This is RIPLEY.
In hypersleep.  Wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer-type
shorts.  Christ, she looks beautiful.  

John looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back.
Sinks to his knees, reverent.  Fascination has replaced fear
again.  Moves his face closer to the lid.  
Closer to hers...

DAYLIGHT spills in --
John's head WHIPS towards the source of the light --

<b>THE DOOR
</b>
Open.  Kyle and the other monks.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttJohn - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNo.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone
ttin here --

The Second Monk looks at Kyle.

<b>tttSECOND MONK
</b>ttThis is forbidden.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttJohn.  Just get the hell out of there --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI don't want to stay.  I have to get her
ttout before this sinks.  You come in, give
ttme a hand --

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttHer?  Look, this is not the supply ship,
ttso this is technology forbidden to us.
ttGet out of there now!

John looks down at Ripely.
A KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube.
A red button:  "EMERG-OPEN"
That's plain enough.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttAll right --

He presses it.
The Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air.
The Monks at the door recoil at the sound.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. SPACE SHIP - ON THE SEA - DAY
</b>
Ripley has been lowered into a large coracle.  John holds her in
front of him.  Unconscious.  
Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves. 
The monks start to row back to short.

<b>tttFIRST MONK
</b>tt     (reverent)
ttA space ship...

<b>tttSECOND MONK
</b>                    (even more reverent)
ttA woman...

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttYou shouldn't have gone in --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI'm supposed to be a doctor.

He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttShe could've been lost.

<b>tttFIRST MONK
</b>ttBeen a long time since I saw either.

<b>tttSECOND MONK
</b>ttIt isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we
ttsupposed to do with it?

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttWhat was it like in there --?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttLights.  So many lights --

<b>tttTHIRD MONK
</b>ttTow it in.  Bring it in.

<b>tttSECOND MONK
</b>ttIt's evil.

<b>tttFIRST MONK
</b>ttIt's just technology.

<b>tttSECOND MONK
</b>ttEvil technology.  Look at these fish --

<b>tttTHIRD MONK
</b>ttThe Abbot will know what we should do
ttwith it --

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttJust lights?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttMachines.  Buttons.  Metal.

<b>tttSECOND MONK
</b>ttSee?  Just look at the fish.

<b>tttTHIRD MONK
</b>ttThe Abbot will know.

<b>tttSECOND MONK
</b>ttThey're boiled.  These fish are boiled. 

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThousands of lights.  Like the stars.
ttLike Heaven on Earth.

Ripley stirs in John's arms.  Groans.
Fights to come out of her fugue state...
Looks around through half-lidded eyes --
She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks.
MONKS?  She closes her eyes.
Tries to clear the imagine.  Opens:
They're still there.
She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist --
realizes she's sitting on someone's lap.
Looks back over her shoulder --

<b>JOHN
</b>
He smiles at her.
Friendly, not sexual.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Shakes her head.  Tries to speak --
Her lips form soundless words.
She looks over her other shoulder, sees --

<b>THE SHIP - RIPLEY POV
</b>
Bobbing on the surface.  
Growing small with each stroke of the oars.

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Brows knit.  Fights the cobwebs in her brain.
Tries to focus on the ship --
Remembers. 
Turns to John, tries to speak --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWait.  New...

She loses consciousness.  

<b>ttttttGO TO BLACK...
</b>
<b>INT. THE ABBEY - RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
Streaks of light move across the darkness.
Form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls.
There is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are
the muted, far off SOUNDS of the Abbey --
The SAWING of wood.  HAMMERING.
WHISPERED prayers.
LILTING song.

We move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed.
Ripley in restless sleep.

<b>EXT. ARCEON SEA - DUSK
</b>
The waters grown rough with the approach of night.  Wind whips across
white wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their 
boats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes --
Start to tow it to shore...

<b>INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe --
She tries to sit up -- can't.  Tries to shake off the effects of
the suspended animation...looks up through half-lidded eyes:

<b>JOHN
</b>
Sits next to her.  Quite asleep.
Hands swathed in white bandages.  Book resting on his lap.

She squints to make the figure standing in the shadows
behind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of
flickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves --

<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Big, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light.
It moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side --
moving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - 
to cry out -- She can't.

She can only move her eyes.  She looks over at John, sleeping
peacefully.  He doesn't notice the Alien --

The Alien moves closer.  
She can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her
forehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move --

The Alien stands alongside her bed.
Extends a six-fingered hand...
Gently rests it on her stomach.
Cocks its head -- like it's listening to something.
The implication is clear.

Ripley finds her voice --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b><b>ttAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
</b>
Her eyes open wide --
She sits bolt upright.

A hand moves to her forehead.  Gently pushes her head back to
the pillow.  John's.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou're out of it.  Out of it...

Ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared.
John sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder:
Nothing.
Ripley's eyes roll back into her head.
She tries to speak -- It was there.
Her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist --

John's hand covers hers.
Eases the fingers open again.
She feels the coarse bandages against her palm.

He starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions.
She begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her
like waves lapping against the shore...

<b>EXT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DAY
</b>
A HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.  The monks wear small round
goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a 
huge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement --

Hundreds of ropes grow TAUT.
Timbers GROAN.
They LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal --

<b>INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
Ripley lays with eyes closed.
Muffled VOICES outside her door:

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttHow is the woman, John?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI don't think she's here yet.

At the sound of John's voice the SLIGHTEST smile plays 
across Ripley's sleeping lips.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttShe is close, though.

As they continue talking, Ripley wakes.  Opens her eyes.
Rolls over onto her side --
There is a window right next to the bed.
Ripley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out:

<b>HER POV
</b>
Garden of Earthly delights...
Monks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky --
picking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes.
Working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages.  Lyrical.
It makes her feel good.  She scans the countryside...

Sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet
up to the -- Ripley does a take --

<b>WORKERS ON A SCAFFOLDING
</b>
With crude brushes at the end of poles -- PAINT the sky blue.
The Abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are all
on one level - INSIDE THE PLANET.

The vaulted CEILING, painted to look like the sky with huge
glass "windows" to allow the sunlight in, is actually the
UNDERSIDE of the planetoid's outer shell.

Ripley looks back at the Monks on the ground:
Instead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stacking
the wood onto push carts --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat the hell --?

<b>SUDDENLY --
</b>The Sulaco Escape ship APPEARS in front of her.
SWINGS past her window suspended by ropes.
Then disappears up, out of sight.
Ripley checks her pulse.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThis must be a dream.  A bad one.

She rolls back onto the bed.
Stares up at the ceiling.

<b>ABOVE HER - ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY
</b>
Monks scurry around the Ship as it is lowered into place on
a flat area of the roof above the libaray.
It seats with a deeply resounding THUD...

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Hears the SOUND and then another - her door OPENING.
She turns to find the Abbot and John standing in the doorway.
John waits in the doorway as the Abbot crosses to the chair by
the bed and sits.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWho are you?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttI am the Abbot.  Leader of this Colony.
ttAnd you?

He smiles.  Open.  Friendly.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttRipley.  How did I get here?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYour vehicle crash landed.
tt     (indicates John)
ttBrother John found you and brought
ttyou here.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhere is here?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttThis is the Minorite Abbey within the
ttmanmade orbiter Arceon.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttCan I use a radio to --
<b>t
</b><b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWe have no radio here.  We are a monastic
ttorder that has renounced all modern
tttechnology.  We live the old way.  The pure
ttway.

She shakes her head.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttUh, I - I still don't feel 100%.  Whoever
tttook me out of the stasis tube must not 
tthave run the full D-F program...
ttWhere's Newt?

The Abbot looks at her blankly.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThere was a little girl with me --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYou were alone.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNo.  She was with me.  I put her in her
ttstasis tube -- We launched when the --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYou were the only living thing found
ttaboard that vessel.

The Abbot watches Ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>tt     (slowly)
ttOh, God.  Newt.

She stops -- gets that chill up her spine --
She realizes that she MUST have brought the Alien with her.

<b>tttRIPLEYt
</b>ttIt came with us.

The Abbot leans in.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWhat came with you?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttListen -- there is a danger here.  It
ttcame with me.  How long have I been here?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttAlmost two days --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>tt     (calculates)
ttLoose for two days.  This planet could be
ttoverrun within the week.

Ripley grabs the Abbot by his cassock --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttLook, there's a xenomorph --
tt    (sees his confusion)
ttAn Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster.
ttAnd now it's here.

The Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner
of Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day.  The
guy with his pants down around his kness.

She sees this, releases her hold on him...
<b>t
</b><b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttCalm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a
ttplatoon of Colonial Marines on a mission
ttto planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six
ttmonths ago - maybe a year --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>tt     (interrupts)
ttWait a moment --

The Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway.
Turns over his shoulder at him.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttLeave us.

John waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttContinue.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWe launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from 
ttGateway sub-orbital space station --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttNot possible.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWhen we left Earth seventy years ago, it
ttwas on the brink of a New Dark Age.
ttTechnology was on the verge of destroying
ttthe planet's environment.  A computer virus
ttwas threatening to wipe away all recorded
ttknowledge.  There didn't seem to be any
ttway it could be averted.  In the almost
ttforty years since we were towed out here
ttin hypersleep, the news that came with 
ttoccasional supply ships only got worse.
ttFinally, the ships stopped coming.  We 
tthad to resign ourselves to the fact that
ttworst had come to pass, and the Earth
ttno longer existed.

Now she gives him that look.
<b>t
</b><b>tttRIPLEY
</b>tt    (slowly)
ttUh...All right... Forget the Earth - How
ttmany people do you have here?  Let's worry
ttabout them.  Warn them --

A new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear.  
Now she's getting to him - or is she?
He abruptly stands. 

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYour mind is troubled.  You need to rest
ttsome more.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI don't need rest - I need to get to 
ttyour people.  You've got to get to them --
tttell them about the alien --

He heads for the door --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttI have had enough for now.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttEnough?  Didn't you hear what I said?
ttIt could wipe out the entire population
ttof this planet.  It may have started 
ttalready - Have there been any unusual 
ttdeaths since I got here?

The Abbot stops in the door -

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttNo.  And there won't be.

The Abbot SLAMS the door behind him.

<b>THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
John stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two BURLY MONKS

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttBolt it.

The guards move to bolt the door.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWhat is it -- What's wrong?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYour patient is in a dangerous mental
ttstate.  Nobody gets in or out until I
ttsay so.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBut I.  Her meals --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttNobody.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttFather, I don't understand --

The Abbot turns and disappears down the hall.
John looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks.


<b>THE LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
John has his head buried in his hands.  His back rises and falls
with the rhythmic breathing of sleep.
Mattias curled up on his feet.  Asleep as well.
<b>WHAM!
</b>The Library door FLIES open --!
John sits bolt upright -- 

A HYSTERICAL MONK bursts in.
Rushes to John's table.

<b>tttHYSTERICAL MONK
</b>ttBrother John!  You're here!  The Abbot
ttsaid you'd -- I need -- you're the
ttmedic --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWhat?!

<b>tttHYSTERICAL MONK
</b>ttMy Sandy -- she's ill --

John tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHuh?  A woman?

<b>tttHYSTERICAL MONK
</b>ttSandy.  My ewe.

John returns his head to the table.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttOne of your sheep?  Jesus Christ.
ttCall a vet.

<b>tttHYSTERICAL MONK
</b>ttFather Anselm was the vet.

John looks under his arms at Mattias --
The dog just stares at him.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou're no help.  Okay, let me get my bag.
ttAll creatures great and small...

<b>INT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT
</b>
A small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens
in wire cages.  The wooden walss are full of gaps where boards
have been ripped off.

The Hysterical Monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene.  One of
his sheep is laying on its side...

<b>tttHYSTERICAL MONK
</b>ttI just gave her dinner and she
ttkeeled over.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttSo would I.  It's freezing in here.

<b>tttHYSTERICAL MONK
</b>ttBeen using the wood from the walls
ttfor the fire in my cabin.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHaven't we all...

John kneels at the ewe.

She's breathing heavy.  Rapidly.

John puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he
checks the animal's neck pulse with his right hand.  
She gives a weak "Baa-ah."

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttMay be pneumonia.  Pitch some of that hay
ttaround her.  Stop this damn cold breeze.

The Hysterical Monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and
retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall.
Starts to pile hay around the fallen animal.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttFirst, I'll --

He sits up to reach for his back, then stops when he sees what's
on his left hand --

<b>A SLIMY MUCOUS-LIKE SUBSTANCE
</b>
<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWait a minute...

The Hysterical Monk stops on mid-pitch.
John rubs the material between his fingers.
Brings it close to his nose.  Sniffs.

<b>tttHYSTERICAL MONK
</b>ttWhat is it?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI don't know.  It's all over the ground.
ttSome sort of --

<b>BAAA-AAAH!!!
</b>The ewe starts to SHAKE - QUIVER --
John tries to hold it down --
The Hysterical Monk, at this juncture, goes completely apeshit.

<b>tttHYSTERICAL MONK
</b>ttWhat?!  WHAT?!

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttJesus!  Help m --

The ewe is shaking so violently that John is thrown back --
He knocks over the bucket -- the torch falls into the hay --
The light is cut off as the torch almost smothers.
Then the hay starts to burn --
Weak fire light revealing:

BAAaa-Aha-SCLORTCH-H-!!
<b>THE EWE EXPLODES ---!
</b>
Stomach BURSTS --
SPRAYING the two Monks with entrails and blood --
They start SCREAMING.

The flickering FIRE LIGHT grows as...

<b>A TERRIBLE ALIEN CHEST-BURSTER
</b>
BURSTS out of the jerking and twitching carcass.

It shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has
gestated.  Tiny razor sharp teeth and black, glass-like eyes
peer from a enlongated head covered with downy, but gore-matted
WOOL.  A quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to free
itself from the cooling morass of intestines.

John can only SCREAM as the most horrible nightmare he can
imagine tries to slough off the animal's mortal coil.

The Hysterical Monk, fear overcome with ANGER at the loss of
his beloved Sandy,  steps in front of the near catatonic Medic
and instinctively THRUSTS his pitchfork into the creature --
The sharp prongs PIERCE its still forming body --

The CREATURE

WAILS a high pitched SHRIEK - half alien, half sheep as it is
roughly TORN from it's nesting place --
The Monk lifts --

It TWISTS at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the
wood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of FIRE.

The Hysterical Monk turns to the now raging hay fire --
The entire corner of the barn is ablaze --
SHOVES the abomination in --

The Sheep/Alien POPS and SIZZLES as tongues of flame leap up to
lap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about --

The creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound
heard within the barn.  The Hysterical Monk holds his fork in
the flame as he looks back to check on --

<b>JOHN
</b>
Face contorted, eyes glued to the burning creature.  Heaving
lungs push air through his diaphram, but no sound comes from
his open mouth -- The Doctor in training has seen the devil.

<b>EXT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT
</b>
Wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre.
Acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out
across the rafters...

We pull back from the sight INTO a window. Into

<b>INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley, watches the burning barn.  Frustrated, she climbs out of
the bed on unsteady legs, wearing her tank top and shorts.
Pulls on a coarse wollen cassock, ties the rope belt --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIdiots...I'll --

<b>WHAM!
</b>The door BURSTS OPEN --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat the -?

Four BURLY MONKS rush in and grab her.
TEAR her out of bed --

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley is dragged down the darkened hallway.

<b>tttABBOT V.O.
</b>ttAn evil has come to Arceon...

<b>IN THE TRIBUNAL ROOM - NIGHT

As he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, ending
at the Abbots...

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYou heard Brother Graham tell of the
ttdevil inside sheep's wool --

He motions towards the Hysterical Monk, sitting in the crowd.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttAn evil brought by this woman in her
ttvessel of technology.

<b>PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
A large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet
high.  Light creeps in through stained glass windows.

Hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over
the floor of the Tribunal.  On the floor:

The Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facing
the witness stand.  On the stand:

<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Considers the faces that surround her.  Fear.  Hate.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThis can't be happening.

<b>tttBALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>ttYou have no voice in this tribunal.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou must listen to me!  You're all in
ttterrible danger!  It came with me on

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWe know that.  At first we believed its
ttarrival was a good omen.  But it has only
ttbrought pestilence.  Dead sheep.  Dead fish.

<b>tttBALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>ttEvil.

Ripley turns to the Abbot.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYes, the ship brought it.  Not evil. It
ttbrought the Alien.  I told you, it's here.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWe know the name of the evil it brought.
ttIt brought technology.  Technology to
ttdestroy our planet, as surely as it
ttdestroyed the Earth.

<b>tttMONK IN AUDIENCE
</b>ttDestruction!

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI was on the Earth less than a year ago.
ttIt's still there.  People, cities, all 
ttstill there!

A murmur through the crowd.  Some are listening to her.
The Abbot looks around.  He must be in command.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>tt    (matter of fact)
ttAll dead.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>tt    (screams)
ttIt's still there!

The Abbot smiles to himself for making her crack.
He stands and begins to pace.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYou could not have been on the Earth a
ttyear ago, because there is no Earth to
ttbe on -- for at least twenty years.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI haven't been floating in space for

ttand I'll prove it.

<b>tttBALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>ttNo.  Who knows what new evils she'll
ttrelease if allowed back into that

<b>tttMONK IN AUDIENCE
</b>ttNo!  Don't let her!!

<b>tttTRIBUNAL MEMBER
</b>ttThis woman is a danger.  She denies The

ttan egg - grows -
ttt(mimes)
ttExplodes out of you - keeps growing into
ttsome sort of monster.  Kills you --
ttKills all of you...

She looks at the Medieval people around her.
They stare at her in complete confusion.
To them, she does sound like a madwoman.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWho are you people?  Look at you -- all
ttof you -- the way you're dressed.  This
ttisn't the Middle Ages.  You're in space --

There, in the upper tier -- John.  They make eye contact. 
She looks to him pleadingly.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIsn't there anyone here who will
ttlisten?

John looks from Ripley to the Abbot.
The Abbot stares him down.
John turns away.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>tt    (defeated)
ttI guess not.  I can't believe this...

The gavel BANGS.
The Abbot sits in a moment of contemplation.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttThen there is no choice.

The Four Monks grab Ripley roughly --
Bind her arms.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>tt   (to Ripley)
ttThe evil is inside you.  I cast you down.
ttTo be sealed away.  And God have mercy on
ttyour soul.

<b>ttttttSLAM CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE SHAFT ROOM - DAY
</b>
A Medieval elevator shaft.  The "elevator" is a wooden cage
lowered on thick, rough hewn ropes.
Ripley, bound, is led to it.

She looks back at the monks who have gathered at the door --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou won't be able to fight it...
ttYou don't know what it is --!

She's put into the cage.  The door is secured.
Two monks begins to pull the ropes.  The cage is lifted out over
the abyss -- a vast cavernesque space.

The other Monks move closer.  Crowd around the edge --
John pushes through them - right to the edge --
Watches as the cage is slowly lowered down...

Ripley looks directly at John --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou've sentenced yourselves to 
ttdeath!

John watches as she disappears down into the darkness...
Then turns and pushes his way through the crowd --
Down the hall --

<b>THE TRIBUNAL ROOM
</b>
Empty now except for the Abbot and the Tribunal Members.
They speak in hushed tones.
John appears in the doorway, but pauses -
strains to hear what they are saying:

<b>tttBALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>tt...they'll have started before she gets
ttdown to the Hermitage level.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttNo trouble?

<b>tttBALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>ttOnly finding the wood for the ship.  But
ttAnderson's hut was about that big, and
tthe's dead three months now.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttI had that wood earmaked for the Cloister 
ttnext winter.  Well, we might not get to
ttthe winter if we don't take care of this.
ttBy winter time we can start taking the 
ttpenitent cells apart.  No one in them.

<b>tttANOTHER TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>ttThe wood isn't going to last forever.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttNeither are we --

He becomes aware of John's presence, and motions the other
Tribunal members out of the room.  John moves to the Abbot.
The Abbot knows what's coming...

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttGo ahead.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThis woman.  Ripley.  I tended her --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYes, and you did a good job.  You
ttshouldn't feel responsible.  You
ttcouldn't have known --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttPlease, sir, let me finish.  I feel that
ttthere may be something to what she says.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttThere isn't.

The Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel,
notebook.  John follows him --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI don't understand what you are doing.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttThis colony is my responsibility.  I am
ttprotecting the colony.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttFrom what?  This woman?  You never gave

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttA better question is what makes you
ttthink I'm wrong?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou didn't see this thing -- this demon --
ttBrother Graham and I -- we both saw it.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>tt      (realizes)
ttThat's right.  You both did.
tt      (beat)
ttAnd what was it?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI -- I don't know what it was.  But I
ttdon't think Ripley was a party to it.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttShe admits she brought it.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBut she tried to warn us --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYou know that's how the devil works.
ttDeception.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBut I believe her.  I don't know how to
ttdescribe it -- A feeling.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYou haven't seen a woman in thirty years.
ttWhere does this feeling originate, John?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>tt     (points to his head)
ttHere.

Pause.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttI believe you.  But your feelings are
ttfooling you.  

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttIt's - It's her conviction.  I just think --

The Abbot snaps at him --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttDon't think.

John takes a step back at the Abbot's tone.  A tone he's never
heard before.  The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair.
Forces a smile.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttIt's been a long night.  For all of us.
ttYou really don't understand what you're
ttdealing with here.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThat's what she said.

The Abbot chafes.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttThese are ideas which threaten the very
ttsystem we live under.  The creature is
ttdead and the woman is gone.  Forget them.
ttBoth.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere,
ttbut leave this alone.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBut I --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttAlone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias
ttinto the Library, all right?  For your

John looks like he's going to protest.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttI mean it.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>tt     (slowly)
ttYes, Father.

John turns and leaves the room.  
The Abbot stares after him.


<b>INT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

Dark. Dank. Dreary.
A NAIL is hammered into a board.  Then another.
The board is old, twisted.  The grain is pronounced, splintered.

Another board is lifted into place, a nail held -- BAM-BAM-BAM -
HAMMERED in tight.


<b>TWO ANCIENT WORKERS

Drab, torn gray clothing.
Hammer the boards over the opening in the wall.

Planks are rising around the ship.
Covering it.  Locking away the good omen turned evil.

<b>IN THE LIBRARY

John and Mattias sit before an open book.
He doesn't read.  He can hear the POUNDING of the hammers.
It seems to reverberate THROUGH the planet.
Through his SKULL.
He closes his eyes in pain.

Only her face is visible.
Another board.

</b>ttHere you go, woman.  Something from your
ttship.  Something to keep you company --

He tosses it into the cell.  Ripley catches it.
Watches as the last of the light is covered over.
<b>BAM-BAM...BAM.
</b>
She continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow
accustomed to the darkness.  The little light creeping between
the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see
what it is she has caught --

<b>NEWT'S DOLL'S HEAD.
</b>
Ripley looks around her cell -- actually a narrow space behind
other cells, one wall curved out -- like a narrow slice
crossways towards the edge of the pie. 
Looks at the Doll's head in her hand.
A beat.

She FREAKS OUT --!

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou fucking idiots!  You're dead!
ttYou're all dead!

BEATS the walls.  KICKS.
SMASHES her HEAD against the wall.
Again.
Her nose starts to bleed.
Her hand goes to her nose.
She squints in the darkenss.
Sees the BLOOD.
Tastes the iron taste in her mouth.
Death is with her again.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>tt     (sotto)
ttDead...

The "widest" part of her cell, the middle, allows her to slide
down into a sitting position.  She does.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttChrist.  Jesus Christ.  It's here.  Here.
ttShit.  Here.  I can't get rid of it...

Looks at the Doll's head --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNewt.  This isn't what I wanted...

She throws the doll's head away --
It bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright position
so that it is staring at her.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>tt     (snaps)
ttDon't stare at me!

Beat.

<b>tttVOICE O/S
</b>ttSorry.

Ripley looks down at the base of the wall facing her --
Where it meets the floor, in the rotting timbers:
A HOLE.  In it:

<b>A MAN'S FACE
</b>
Bright, wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut.
He's looking back at her.


<b>ON THE ROOF OF THE MONASTERY - NIGHT
</b>
The Sulaco escape pod #4 is now a memory as the Monks have
finished walling it up.  Now just another part of the Abbey.

As the Monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow --
Pass them -- down to an open window and into...


<b>INT. LIBRARY - THE MEDIEVAL SECTION - NIGHT INTO DAWN
</b>
John is here, Mattias asleep at his feet.
The tables, the benches, the floor are COVERED with hundreds of
books he's pulled off the shelves, their chains all TANGLED.
All open to --

<b>PICTURES OF DEVILS
</b>
Different representations of Evil through the ages --
Lucifer, Shaitan, Ahriman, Asmodeus -- Satan.
"The Temptation of Christ" from the Master of Schloss
Lichtenstein.  Satan roasting on an enormous grill from
"Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry."

The devil as a serpent.  As a semi-humanoid.
Gruenwald's "Temptation of St. Anthony."
Pacher's "Saint Wolfgang and the Devil."
A miasma of Medieval Monsters.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Picks his way through the mess.  Like a man possessed he fumbles
through book after book.

The first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge
stained glass windows.  John rapidly flips through the Medieval
tome in front of him - past an illustration of Satan depicted
as having a FACE on his ASS -- further still -- then stops.
This is it.

We can't see what the illustration is, but we see his REACTION:

His eyes open wide as saucers.  SLAMS the book closed as if the
image would strike blind.  He turns to Mattias as if to say
something -- Decides not to wake the sleeping dog.

John wraps the book's chain around his hand and puts one foot
up against the shelf.  Pulls -- SPANKT!
The old chain gives way.

Face set, he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag
over his shoulder.  Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets
his sleeping dog and goes...


<b>INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ABBOT'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
John strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and
flattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's 
office opens suddenly --

BROTHER GRAHAM, The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the 
room by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other
direction.  He is gagged.  A third Burly Monk moves out of the
doorway with the Abbot.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNow find John and have him brought to 
ttme immediately.

<b>tttTHIRD BURLY MONK
</b>ttYes, Father.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttStart in the library.  And keep it quiet. 

The Third Burly Monk nods and moves off.
The Abbot watches him leave, then goes back into the room and
closes the door.  John stares at the closed door a beat and then
makes up his mind.  He turns and runs back down the hallway...


<b>INT. GLASS FACTORY - DAY
</b>
The first Monks straggle in for the morning shift.
Kyle is among them.  He lifts his blowing iron from a wall
mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two
other Monks begin to stoke the fire.

John enters.
Looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find --


<b>KYLE
</b>
At the glass furnace.  About to dip his blowing iron into the 
MOLTEN GLASS.  John runs over to him.
Almost knocks him over --

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttHey!  Watch it!

He sees that John is agitated --

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttWhat?  What is it?

The other monks begin to notice the commotion, start moving in
for a look...

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI -- Abbot.  Must --

John tries to catch his breath.  He gestulates wildly.
Kyle puts down his blowing iron.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttJohn - relax.  Take a deep breath -
ttChrist, now I sound like you --

He sees the book clutched in John's white knuckled hands.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttIs that it, John?  Is it the book --?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>tt     (panting)
ttYes.  Devil.

Kyle moves closer to him.  Cautiously.
John sees the other monks gathering around --
Closing in on him - whispering --

<b>tttWHISPERING MONKS
</b>ttHe's got it...

<b>tttSECOND WHISPERING MONK
</b>ttLike the Comet Woman...

<b>tttTHIRD WHISPERING MONK
</b>ttHe found her...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttWHISPERING MONK
</b>ttHe's infected...

John sees one of the Monks run out -- undoubtedly going to tell
the Abbot.  John looks into his friend Kyle's face -- Fear.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttEverything's gonna be fine.  Now, let's
ttsee the --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttDon't humor me -- I'm --
<b>t
</b><b>tttKYLE
</b>ttSure.  Everything's gonna be fine...

If only he could explain - he can't.
John YANKS the book away -- spins --
Bursts through the crowd...

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttWait -- JOHN!


<b>INT. SHAFT ROOM - DAY
</b>
The cage is still down, the ropes stretching into the abyss.
John runs in.  Moves to the ropes.  Places the book on the floor.
Tightens his scarred hands on the rope -- Mind racing:  
The woman will know.  Know what it is.  How to combat it.
He PULLS --

There's no tension against the ropes.
John FALLS back on his ass.

The ropes WHIZ through the rusty pulley overhead.
Pile on the floor in front of John. 
He lifts the end of the rope.  Stares:
<b>BITTEN THROUGH.
</b>
<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>THROUGH THE MONASTERY - SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
John RUNS through the building.
Through the upper half of the planet.
DOWN through the many levels, past dozens of Monks oblivious to
the previous night's events and the danger they face:

Monks working at Looms.
Monks in the Tanning Room.
Monks in Morning Prayer.
Past them all, to --


<b>INT. ABBEY BASEMENT WORKROOM - DAY
</b>
Mops and brooms.
John enters.  His hair is wild, breathing heavy.
He shoves the book into his medical bag.
Pushes aside a box of kindling wood to reveal a
WOODEN DOOR set into the timbers of the floor.
He opens the door:


<b>LADDERS
</b>
Extending down through huge open areas beneath the upper level.
Past vast underground viaducts that held up by wooden rafters.
Beyond that - a great underground sea that marks the center of
the planet - below that, the cells.
And Ripley.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Can smell the dank air from the lower tunnels.
He MUST go down -- The hard way.
He climbs into the darkness...


<b>INT. ABBEY LAVATORY - NIGHT
</b>
An enormous room, over a football field in length, consisting
of at least a hundred open toilet STALLS facing a hundred wall
mounted SINKS.  Their condition, though, bespeaks the awful
truth -
The stalls furthest away from us are COBWEBBED.
Some have had the side walls stripped for fire wood.
Of the original hundred sinks, maybe twenty are still
functional - A facility created for a much larger number of
colonists than are left.

A SKINNY MONK washes his hands.


<b>IN THE STALLS
</b>
Moving down the row of stalls (chest high, thank you) past a
few empty stalls and several grimacing faces, the second to
last being The Abbot --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttCold tonight --

-- continuing to the last, Bald Tribunal Member.

<b>tttBALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
</b>ttGets colder every night.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttAnd every day.  Never this bad.  Taken
ttso much wood out of the structure the
ttsurface wind blows right through the
ttcolony.  Right under the floor --

The Bald Tribunal Member SHIVERS as a cold breeze runs along the
waste trough under the floor and chills the air in his bowl. 

<b>tttBALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
</b>ttRight up your bloody backside.  Nights
ttlike this make me miss plumbing -- 
ttAck --!

He feels a TUGGING at his bowels - it's not piles. 
A beat.

<b>tttABBOT O/S
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttBALD TRIBUNAL MONK
</b>ttI don't -- AAH --

The Bald Tribunal Monk SCREAMS as something GRABS him from
below --

(note: the left half of the following 5 pages is cut off.
I have completed the text to the best of my ability.)

Something SNAKES up his rectum and hooks into his lower intestine!
He convulses in spasms of agony.

There is a terrible RIPPING SOUND as the Bald Tribunal Monk is 
PULLED VIOLENTLY down -- out of frame --

We PAN BACK down the row of stalls tight on each sitting Monk
and see their HORRIFIED REACTION as they feel the ALIEN drag the
Bald Tribunal Monk's body away under them...

THE ABBOT in his stall

He pounds on the wall --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttMatthew?  Matthew?  Jesus, what's wrong?

SKINNY MONK washing his hands, sees all this.  Looses control
of his bodily functions as blood sprays from the faucet --


<b>OTHER MONKS
</b>
In their stalls as the toilets reject a torrent of gore!  
Blood and viscera spraying the walls -- converting the Abbey
into an abattoir.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

Angle on the Orbitor Arceon:

An orb of wood hands peacefully against a tapestry of celestial
seas.

<b>INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - NIGHT
</b>
Darkness.  Somewhere water drips into a puddle.
Ripley lays on her side on the floor with her head resting
near the hole in the floor.  Her eyes are closed.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWherever I go.

A HAND pushes a crust of bread through the hole. 
She opens her eyes to look at the food.  The White-Haired Man's
head appears --

<b>tttWHITE-HAIRED MAN
</b>ttTake it.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThanks, but no thanks, Anthony.

She knows his name.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttYou waiting for meat?  They don't bring
ttme meat because they know I'm an android.
ttReally don't need it.  Bread's better
ttfor you anyway.  Harder to digest, so 
ttit makes you feel fuller than you are.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNot hungry.

Anthony takes a bite.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttMmmm.  Just a little crunchy.

Ripley twists onto her back until she's staring up at the
ceiling.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWaste of time.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttYou don't eat, you'll starve to death,
ttgirl.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThat was the plan when they put me down
tthere.  And why should you care?

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttBecause I'm a synthetic person you don't
ttthink I can care?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttBelieve me, that's a discussion you don't
ttwant to have with me.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttYou told me you had a bad experience and
tta good one with androids --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThat's one of each.  That means you could
ttgo either way.  I'm tired of talking about
ttthis.

He pushes the bread towards her again.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttYou've still gotta eat.  You gotta fight
ttthe bastards --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI'm tired of fighting.  Maybe I'll be
ttdead before he finds me.  Maybe he won't
ttget the satisfaction.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttHe?  You make it sound like this Alien
tthas a personal score to settle with you.
ttThe biology you describe:  Queen laying
tteggs, larvae, drone -- that's very
ttinsectoid.  Insects usually don't bear
ttgrudges.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAnd Androids usually aren't the prisoners
ttof lunatics that believe they're ancient 
ttGreeks.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttMedieval Monks.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhatever.t

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttAnd they've only chose to live the life
ttstyle, they don't believe they're --
tt     (hears something)
ttWhat's that?

Ripley strains to listen.  In the distance:
KNOCKING.  Someone is knocking on the walls.
A VOICE calls out --


<b>INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttJOHN
</b>tt     (hoarse)
ttRipley!

He moves down the hallway.
BANGS his fist against the walls every few feet --
Waits a moment for a reply, then moves on.


<b>INT. ANTHONY'S CELL
</b>
Anthony gets off the floor - Moves so she can see into his cell:

The walls of Anthony's cell are covered with charcoal sketches -
Different versions of demons and the devil.  She rolls her eyes -
This guy is an Android!

Anthony crosses to his cell door, peers through eye level.


<b>INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR HALLWAY - ANTHONY POV
</b>
John coming towards him, knocking on the doors of boarded up cells.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttHey -- you knocking -- cut it out --
ttYou're going to wake everybody up.

John moves to Anthony's door.  Looks at him through the slot.
Anthony recognizes him.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttBrother John?

John unbolts Anthony's door.
Picks him up by his cassock --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttAnthony?  Thought you dead fifteen years.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttMade too good for that.  What're
ttyou doing?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI -- I'm looking -- the Abbot --

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttWhat?  You look like you've seen the
ttdevil.

<b>tttRIPLEY O/S
</b>ttHe has.

Anthony turns to look back at Ripley -- moves aside so John can 
see her face at the hole --

<b>tttANTHONY 
</b>ttYou mean he --

Anthony turns back - John is gone.

<b>INT. THE CORRIDOR
</b>
As John begins to PULL the outermosk planks off.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI was right, wasn't I?  You've seen it,
ttyou've seen the Alien?

John pauses at that.  
His eyes tighten at the memory.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI can tell you have.  I was right.
ttIt came with me.
ttt(to the wall, sharp)
ttGo away.

John stops.  Looks at the wall.
Ripley's voice comes clearly through the wood...

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttListen, priest, or whatever you are, I
ttknow what you want.  I can't help you.
ttI couldn't help any of the others.  
ttJust stop what you're doing.  Go away.
ttDo you understand?

John has opened a crack that exposes Ripley's eyes.  
He stares at her a beat, tries to think of what to reply --
He goes back to work as she continues her confession...

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou going to stay, Father?  But you're 
ttnot going to talk.  Okay.  Then you can
ttlisten.  You should listen.  Your Abbot
ttwas right.  I am guilty.  But not of 
ttheresy.  Of murder.

John stops again.
Just stares at her eyes.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThe murder of the crew of the Nostromo.
ttThat was when I first met the Alien.

That reminds him of why he's here.
He doubles his efforts at the boards...

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNo, not the same one that's here now.
ttOr maybe it is.  Maybe they're all the 
ttsame one.  I couldn't save my crew then.
ttI should have been able to.  But I couldn't.
ttWhen I went the second time --

Her eyes soften.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThen I met Newt.  Newt.  I fought --
ttstayed alive to keep Newt alive.
ttHoped maybe that would make up for...

She trails off.  Slides down the wall.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNow he got her too.  What's the point?
tt     (hard again)
ttJust go away.  Leave me in here.  If you
ttlet me out you'll want me to help you
ttand it will start all over again.
ttLet it end.

John breaks through, flickering torch light streams in the mote
filled air around him.  Ripley looks up at him.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI can't help you.

John, heaving and panting from the excertion.
Swallows...

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttPuh. (pant) Please.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIt never ends.


<b>INT. CORRIDOR - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
A long, twisted-plank-floored corridor with a torch every 
twenty feet.  There is MOVEMENT at the far end.  Something is
coming towards us - FLICKERING in and out of the light and 
shadow --

<b>tttRIPLEY O/S
</b>ttSheep?

<b>RIPLEY, JOHN AND ANTHONY
</b>
Running together.  Anthony carries a long wooden staff like a 
spear.  John has his bag.  Ripley a torch. 
We move with them.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttIt must be able to take on some of the
ttcharacteristics of the animal it grows in.
ttMaybe they are from some sort of aggressive
ttsoldier race -- warring parties drop the
tteggs on opposing planets --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAnd the alien takes on the form of the
ttcreature that finds it, assuming that
ttanimal is the dominant life form on the
ttplanet.  So when it gestates in a man --

Ripley shudders at the memory.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttIt's a biped.  In a sheep or cow, a quadroped.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttShit.  I just didn't think it could do that
ttto animals.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWait a minute - I thought you were the
ttexpert on this monster.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIs that the only reason you came to get
ttme out?  Because I knew about this thing?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYes.  I mean no.  I mean, that was part of
ttit.  Look.  I never thought you were wrong.
ttI was wrong not to say anything.  I was
ttafraid to speak up.  It's hard to be a 
ttmonk, you know?

Ripley stops.  Looks at him.
A long beat.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThank you.  If anything, you're honest.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe all are.  Took vows.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI don't know about the Abbot.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI'm sure he thinks what he did was right.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIs that speaking up for someone?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNo.  Charity.

She smiles.  They turn a corner...


<b>INT. SLOPING CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
This hallway slopes downwards a few degrees.  The three find 
themselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAll right, let's forget about the past
ttand get on to our survival.  No more
ttprisoners behind us?

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttNot for years.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttOkay -- If the Alien's had a few days
ttto lay his eggs our only hope is to get
ttoff this - What is this?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttArceon.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttSatellite.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttGet to my ship and get off this Satellite.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe can't.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWe can't what?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttLeave Arceon.  Can't leave the library --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttA Tape Library?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBooks.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttSo?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThe reason we are out here.  Like the
ttMonks who guarded Monastery Libraries 
tton remote islands off England during
ttthe First Plague --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThere must be books on other colonies --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttSome of these books survived the burning
ttof the Libraries of Alexandria.  They
ttcontain knowledge that exists in no 
ttother record.  Their value is unestimable.

He runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe're supposed to protect them.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>tt    (to Anthony)
ttAnd what does an android have to do 
ttwith all this?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHe's a spy.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThe Company planted me here.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThe Company?  What does the Company have
ttto do with this?

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThey built this prison.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttPrison?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttColony.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttPrison.  They are all political heretics.  

Ripley looks at John.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou left that part out.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThe order was more of a counter culture,
tta reaction to the Technology that was
ttbeginning to take over everyone's lives.
ttIt was a simple enough idea - Read, don't 
ttwatch disk.  Walk, don't pump more carbons
ttinto the air.  The earliest members
ttrenounced technology.  Started to collect
ttthe remaining books.  Nobody would have
ttnoticed if it hadn't been for the Virus.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYour Abbot talked about that.  The
ttNew Plague.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttA computer virus.  A bad program.  By
ttthis time the Corporate structure was
tttransglobal, all the world's data storage
ttsystems were linked.  It spread through
tttwo countries before it was stopped.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttAfter a scare like that, thousands flocked
ttto our retreat.  People started clamoring
ttfor written information.  For our books.
ttThey abandoned the modern ways --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI think I can see how this comes out.t
ttThey gave up their possessions.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThis was a threat --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttTo the Company.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThey sold the technology.  A movement 
ttto live simply was quickly twisted by 
ttFederal agents into a political movement
ttagainst the Company-controlled World
ttGovernment.  Too much was at stake.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttToo much profit.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe were sentenced as political dissidents.
ttThis orbiter is our gulag.  All the men
ttwere packed up with all our books, and
tttowed into space.  Ten thousand men.  The
tteldest died very quickly.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThe Company had such a sense of irony.  
ttSending you out on this wooden tub.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttI was placed among them as a sensor.
ttKeeps tabs on the movement.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttSo how'd they find out about you?

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttI told them.  After the supply ship's
ttstopped coming I saw no point in keeping
ttup the charade.  Since I was a sort of
ttwalking reminder of technology, they cast
ttme down.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttJoin the club.
tt     (to John)
ttI figured this wasn't planned.  You don't
tthave to be a genius to see it wouldn't be
ttprudent to try to preserve man's written
ttworks for generations -- without women.

John looks embarrassed.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAnd I don't know about your New Plague,
ttbut I was just on Earth and everything's 
ttfine.

John has a doubtful look.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI was right about the Alien, wasn't I?
ttMeans I must be right about the Earth.

The logic behind her argument is uncomfortable.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>tt     (beat)
ttPerhaps.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThat's better than nothing.  Come on.

They reach the end of the corridor.
It opens into --


<b>INT. TRANSOM SPACE - PRISON LEVEL
</b>
An enormous open space between "cell blocks."
The Wall behind them is honey-combed with corridor openings
going up four stories, connected by aged, warped wooden ladders
reminiscent of Indian cave dwellings.  Only wooden.

The room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them
-- falling off into gloom.

They stand silent for a moment, dwarfed by the size of the room
and the task ahead of them.  Finally --


<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAt any rate, let's forget about the
ttEarth completely - whether you're right
ttor I'm right what's important is getting
ttthe hell out of here.  From here my ship
ttis...?

John points up at the ceiling.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttIn Heaven.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttRight.  And this is...

Anthony and John nod.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThis orbiter was patterned after a 
ttmedieval concept of the universe --
ttt (makes a circle in the air)
ttThey call the top half "Heaven - "

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThe Abbey, the fields --

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThe bottom half is "Hell."  Where we are.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAptly named.  What's in the middle?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThe sea.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttReally.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWork with me here.  How far is it back
ttto the surface of the planet?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttAs a stone falls --- Five miles through
ttthe center.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAnd the elevator -- the thing they
ttlowered me down in?

<b>tttJOHNt
</b>ttRopes cut.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttIt's smart.  First he cuts their escape
ttoff, then works his way down through the 
ttmonastery level by level until there
ttisn't a thing left alive.  Interesting...

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWell, you start appreciating him more
ttthan me and I'll find a way to shut
ttyou down, capisce, Andy?  How do we
ttget up?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThere are ladders.

She stops.  John and Anthony continue on a few steps and then
stop and walk back to her.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttFive miles with the Alien between us
ttand there?  Good luck, boys.

She turns and heads back towards her cell --
John catches her shoulder --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou can't --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttCan't what?  Not help you go to your
ttdeaths?  I've had my fill of that.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI need you.  I can't do it alone.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI've fought these creatures twice
ttbefore.  It take a lot to kill
ttthese things.  Heavy artillery.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttWe don't have weapons here.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHow about something we can make weapons
ttfrom?  Do you have anything like that --
ttany modern things here?

John SHAKES his head vehemently --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe renounced technology.  It was those
ttthings that caused the Plague.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThis is a man-made planet.  Something has
ttto be recirculating your air, your water.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttGod?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttPlease.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI don't know.  I just took it for granted.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttMost people do.  Without some sort of
tttechnology we haven't got a chance.

From behind them:

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThere is technology.

John and Ripley turn to look at him.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttA room.  A Technology room.  Fresh air
ttand water come out.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAn atmosphere processing plant --

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThe heart and lungs of Arceon.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhere is it?

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttOne level beneath the underground sea.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThat's five levels up --

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>tt     (points into the gloom)
ttOn the other side of the orbiter.

John looks at Ripley --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttA chance.

Ripley looks from John's earnest face to the darkness and back.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAll right.  You've got me - so far.
ttBut here's the deal:  I don't know
tthow many of your brethren are going
ttto be alive when we get up there,
ttbut if we make it to my ship, you're
ttall coming with me.  We'll take as
ttmany of your precious books as we
ttcan carry, but we're going.  I'm not
ttgoing to fight this thing again to 
ttend up alone again.  Understand?

John nods his head.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWe're all dead anyway.  We might as
ttwell go fi --

She feels a TWINGE in her midsection --
Doubles over.  Anthony and John each take an arm --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttUgh - I'm all right.

She takes a deep breath.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttStill thawing out.  I hate hyper sleep...
ttCome on.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>INT. ARCEON - MONASTERY LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
The formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorched
battlefield.  Wooden huts leveled.  Small fires dot the land.
The air thick with ash and greasy smoke.

DOZENS OF MONKS swarm across the countryside like ants on a 
mound of spilt sugar.  In one hand a taper or torch held high,
in the other hand their WEAPON: scythe, pitchfork, hoe,
whatever they could get ahold of, seem pitifully out of place.
Some pound sharpened stakes into the ground, others push carts
into rough barricades.

A "Platoon" of Monks huddle around trap doors open on the
wooden "ground."  More ladders.
They climb down to --


<b>AN UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT
</b>
Just beneath the Monastery level of the satellite: an 
Underground Wheatfield.  Tall golden grass stretches out for
miles, swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support
the Abbey fifty feet above --

<b>THE CEILING
</b>
A lattice-work of suspended troughs and wooden pipes --
the "plumbing," the understructure, of the Monastery.


<b>THE MONKS
</b>
Descend the ladders single file.  Fear is in all of their faces
though most have only heard the stories.  They move cautiously
into the wheat.  Spread out through the field in the jaggedly
drawn skirmish line.


<b>THE ABBOT
</b>
The Bald Tribunal Monk's dried blood splattered on his cassock,
stands atop an empty wooden wagon.  From this vantage point he
watches


<b>THE MONKS IN THE FIELD
</b>
THRASH and POKE their way forward leaving trails through the
high grass.  Their attempt at an orderly progression quickly
falls apart as they get strung out all over the field.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>tt     (sotto)
ttStay together.  Together...

Then another movement catches the Abbot's eye --
AHEAD of the Monks - the wheat waves against the wind.
Begins to ripple -- the wheat flattens.
a TRAIL forms.
SomeTHING is MOVING in the long grass.
Moving towards the Lead Monk -- FAST.

The Abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning - even
though the Monk closest to the moving trail is too far away to
hear him - before he can make a sound The Alien closes the gap -
Feeling horribly helpless he can only watch as

AARGH-Aa -!
The Lead Monk gives one strangled CRY before he disappears
beneath the surface of the long grass.  His taper falls
among the long, dry stalks -- begins to SMOKE...

The Abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before they
can.  He finds his voice:

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttRun!  RUN!

The Monks in the field turn from the spot where the Monk
screamed towards the Abbot -- TURN THEIR BACKS to the now
moving again trail --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttNo - NO.  The --

The Alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle --
RAKING through five Monks like a scythe through wheat.
His tail, arms WHIP out --
SNAP their spines like kindling.
Lost torches ignite the wheat...

The field BURSTS INTO FLAME.
Smoke fills the air.

In the smoky commotion the Monks break rank and start running.
Weapons in front of them -- SWINGING wildly --
Screaming.  Crying.  DYING.

One Frightened Monk runs through another with his pitchfork.
Another hears something crashing through the grass towards
him and buries his scythe in his best friend's chest.

And through it all the Alien seems to be everywhere.
Using the chalky smoke for cover as it SLASHES and TEARS its way
across the field --


<b>THE ABBOT
</b>
Frozen in terror to the spot.   Squints through the smoke to see
what has happened to his flock.  Hears the WAILS of defeat
rising up from the wounded.

The waving grass is flattened as The Alien moves towards him --

He can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon.
He climbs down.  As his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a
shadow fall over him.  The little hairs on the back of his neck
stand up.  He slowly turns...

<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Rises out of the grass in front of the Holy Man.
Slowly rises up to its height of almost three meters.
It's long, smooth head is no longer black and slimy.

It is golden.
It's cable-like arms are sheathed in a straw-like covering.
It has adapted to the environment of the wheat field.  Its now
grass-like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile.

The Abbot SCREAMS and RUNS.


<b>tttJOHN O/S
</b>ttIt isn't your fault, you know.


<b>INT. TRANSOM SPACE - SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
They move across the huge room...Anthony a few paces ahead.
Their candles throwing only enough light to see several yards.
Wind whistles through the huge room, timbers creaking like some
gigantic old house settling.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThose things you said before --

Ripley remembers her "confession."

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI read about it in psychology books.
ttSometimes when people outlive someone
ttthey cared for, they transfer some of
ttthe guilt for that person's death to
ttthemselves.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI got a belly full of that from the
ttPsychtechs when I was on Earth.  Yeah.
tt"Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something
ttlike that.  But that's not what I was
ttthinking about.  I was thinking about
ttmy "friend" up there.

She looks up.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHe was on the pod.  He killed Newt but
ttnot me.  Why not me?  It's almost like
tthe's playing with me.  Maybe they have
ttsome sort of race memory.  Maybe he
ttknows what I did to his "mother."
ttThat's why he didn't just kill me.
ttThat would be too easy.  He has to
tttorment me.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou make it sound human.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHell, I don't know what it is.

John unconsiously fingers his book.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI think I do.


<b>INT. LADDER-WELL - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
At the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to 
another block of cell corridors four stories up.
Years of damp air have warped the ladder.
Ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand.
They climb...


<b>INT. END OF PRISON CORRIDOR - FOURTH LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>
Dark.  Ripley is the first one up.
She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone.
The cells here have no doors.
She holds her torch in one --
An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation.


<b>AT THE LADDER
</b>
John is just climbing off, Anthony right behind him.  
Anthony is winded.  He reaches up for a helping hand.
John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without
them, then reaches down to help Anthony.
Their hands clasp --


<b>ANTHONY HAS A "VISION"
</b>
He is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing
peacefully at his side.
SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons.

Fish faced demons.  Man-headed bird demons.
They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs.
The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of
razor sharp fangs, SINKS THEM INTO HIS ANKLE --

Anthony SCREAMS -!


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Down the corridor HEARS the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony
fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp -


<b>ANTHONY
</b>
Balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real 
world as he fights against the demons in his android mind --
He JERKS --
Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the DEMON SHEEP --
OFF the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him...


<b>JOHN
</b>
Struggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand.
It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttJesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -!

He PULLS with all his might...


<b>ANTHONY
</b>
SEES a horrible BIRD-DEMON grasping his hand in its beak --
BITING through his wrist.  He waves his staff in the air --
He aims for its head:
<b>CRACK -!
</b>WHACKS John's hand with his staff --

John HOWLS in pain - LETS GO --

Anthony TEETERS BACK ON ONE FOOT, arms waving in the air --

Ripley's hands SHOOT OUT --
GRAB Anthony's cassock --
STOP his fall.

Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror --
A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched
itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head.
Ripley has become the Alien.

<b>WHACK!
</b>Anthony HITS the Creature with his staff --
HITS Ripley on the head.
<b>WHACK!
</b>Again.  In the face.

John tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm --
<b>WHACK!
</b>The cane WHIPS against the side of his head, knocking him back.
Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock --
Opens her mouth - GRUNTS --

ANTHONY sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him.

<b>WHACK! 
</b>His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose.
She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance --
Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony --

<b>JOHN GRABS THEM!
</b>
Wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo
wrestler LIFTS and FALLS backwards - carrying the three of them
into the corridor -- WHUMPH!

They land on the floor in a heap.
Anthony continues to FLAIL ABOUT --

Ripley and John pin him to the floor between them.
Finally, the vision leaves him.
He loses consciousness.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Breathing heavy - opens his eyes --
He's staring right into Ripley's face.
Less than an inch away.
He's laying on top of her.
She's breathing heavy too.
A long, uncomfortable moment.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThanks.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou're welcome.

They roll off each other.
Her hand goes up to her nose.
Blood.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI'm all right.

John reaches into his bag, withdraws a small cotton bag.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHold this against your nose.  It'll
ttstop the flow.

She looks over at him questioningly.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI'm a doctor.

She holds the small bag against her nose.  The bleeding stops.
They move over to Anthony - try to help him to his feet.
He shakes them off.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttNo - please.  Just let me sit.
ttAwhile.

He rubs his temples.  White, milk-like sweat runs down his
cheek.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttDamn it.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat was that?

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThe reason I'm down here.

John points to his own eyes.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttVisions.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttDreams.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAndroids can't dream...

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThat's probably what they thought when
ttthey built me.  But my brain is cyber-
ttorganic - patterned after the human
ttbrain - it functions the same way a
tthuman brain does.  It accumulates random
ttimages and sensations during waking 
tthours, but unlike the human brain that
ttsloughs them off during sleep --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAndroids don't sleep.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttRight.  Maybe they've fixed this on later
ttmodels, but I don't.  Do you know what 
tthappens to the human brain when it is
ttdeprived of sleep?  It starts to run off
ttthe dreams while you're awake, as 
tthallucinations.  Same thing with me.
ttFor twenty years I absorbed data on this
ttplanetoid.  A little after we lost contact
ttwith Earth the visions started.  They
ttthought I was insane.  I had to explain 
ttthat it was because I was an android.
ttThey liked that even less.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat did you see?

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttWhat I always see.  Images of Monsters.
ttDemons.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThey're portents.  They stand for an
ttevil yet to come.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttJust images I've absorbed from those old
ttbooks and have no way to get rid of.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI saw the inside of your cell.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>tt     (shrugs)
ttMy head is full of them.  I try to get
ttthem out any way I can.

His eyelids droop.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou need sleep.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttI know that.  I'll settle for rest.

He closes his eyes.  Ripley recovers the torch.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttStay with him.

Ripley tried to stand - John takes her arm, pulls her down.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNo.  We all need rest.  You especially.

Ripley considers him.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttDoctor's orders.

She smiles and sits.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBesides, you see what happens when you
ttget ahead of us.  We should stay together.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAll right.  He's still above us, anyway.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI've faced this evil twice before - I
ttguess I've gotten sensitive to it --
tt     (beat)
ttYou're really a Doctor?

John pats his canvas bag.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttSee my bag?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat's that book?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttJust a book.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI don't buy "just a book" from a guy who
ttsays we can't leave the planet without
ttthe library.
<b>ttt
</b><b>tttJOHN
</b>ttIt's just... a medical book I might need.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou don't have any food in there, do you?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttOnly if you can eat bandages.

Ripley rubs her midsection.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIn a few hours that's going to sound
ttgood.  Going in and out of suspended
ttanimation - Christ I probably haven't
tteaten in a year.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>tt    (without opening eyes)
ttYou should've eaten the bread.

<b>tttRIPLEY AND JOHN
</b>ttRest!

Ripley lets her head loll back against the wall.
Closes her eyes.  Time passes.
Her brow knits.
John sees this.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou all right?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAces.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou weren't hurt when I landed on you?
ttBruised a rib?

He reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock.
Feels her midsection.  His hands are warm.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAre you sure you're a doctor?

He withdraws his hands.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttSort of.  My father passed on when we 
ttfirst came here.  The Abbey's Physician -
ttFather Anselm - took me in.  He really
ttraised me --
ttt  (pause)
ttTaught me what he could before he
ttpassed away.  He was schooled on Earth.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWell, I'm just hungry.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou haven't eaten since I took you
ttout of your tube.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou did that...

She reaches out and takes hold of his hands.  Turns them over.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou burned yourself on the escape pod.

Her hands on his makes him feel...uncomfortable.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThank you, I guess.

They look into each other's eyes --

<b>tttANTHONY O/S
</b>ttYou should've eaten the bread.

Ripley, embarrassed, releases his hands.
Looks at Anthony.  He's trying to stand.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttEnough rest.  There's beasties afoot.

They start into...


<b>A NARROW CORRIDOR
</b>
Ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them.
Ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks.


<b>INT. LADDER SHAFT
</b>
A great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere.
Seems at least a mile long.
The group climbs...


<b>A SERPENTINE CORRIDOR
</b>
Liquid drips through the ceiling planks over head.
Falls into RED puddles on the slanted floor.

John kneels, dips his fingertips --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBlood.
tt     (sniffs)
ttMixed with sea water.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttWe're getting close to the center of
ttthe arc -- near the sea.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttBlood.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttGetting close...

John HEARS somthing.
Raises his hand -- "stop"
The group stops.  Flatten themselves against the wall.

John takes Anthony's staff.
Moves forward with it held out in front of him...
WHIRLS around a blind corner --
SHOVES something against the wall --
Thump!
It struggles --

Ripley and Anthony run up -- raise their tapers --
Revealing:

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThe Abbot.

Cassock torn, dirty.  Hair, eyes wild.
Anthony's staff across his throat. 
John pulls back.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttFather --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>tt   (sarcastic)
ttWhat are you doing down here, father?
ttYou look like you've seen something
ttthat doesn't exist.

The Abbot runs his fingers through his hair.  Smoothes it down.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttI was their spiritual leader.  I was not
ttprepared to lead them in battle.
ttNot against that thing.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNo one could be.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI thought you said the evil was inside
ttme -- that sealing me up was the answer
ttto all your problems?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttDestruction.  The destruction YOU brought
ttto us!

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI only tried to warn you.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWhat are you doing with this woman --?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe are going to the Technology Room.
ttTrying to find some way to fight --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYou don't join the devil to fight the
ttdevil.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttShe's helping us --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttLook who defends the deceiver -- the one
ttwho isn't even human.  John, can't you see
ttwhat is happening?  On ancient Earth,
ttduring the Black Death - many believed
ttthat God had abandoned them, so they
ttappealed to the Devil.  Flocked to him
tthoping to save their bodies - losing their
ttsouls in the bargain.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttFather, we're all on the run from the 
ttsame monster so let's not resort to the
ttfire and brimstone routine.  I've been
ttenlightened about your "movement."
ttPretty funny to be tried for heresy on a
ttplanet of heretics.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttPlease. 

The time for pretense is past.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttAll right.  I was trying to keep you quiet. 

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttSir --?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttI do what I have to do to keep the
ttBrotherhood together.  We all gave up
ttbelieving in Earth a long time ago.  How
ttdo you think they would feel if told
tttheir exiled was in vain?  That the
ttholocaust they were trying to avoid
ttnever occured?  Those men up there have
ttgrown to live with it.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAnd with you as their leader.

The Abbot smiles.  Ripley is sharp.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttYou threatened the status quo.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttSo you, protector of knowledge and truth,
ttlied to them.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttOnly about you.  The rest I still
ttbelieve.  If Earth still orbits its sun
ttthere is no way it could have survived
ttbeing reduced to Barbarism.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou're as bad as the Company.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttRipley --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThat's why you ran.  After all your talk
ttdeath stared you in the face and you
ttwere afraid.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttNot afraid of death.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThe Alien.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThe Organism.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttThe Devil.


<b>INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM CORRIDOR
</b>
The now four refugees work their way into the final corridor.
Dark.  Turns at sharp angles.  Blind alleys.
The floor is uneven, wood aged and twisted.
Warped by years of water dripping from above.
The group strings out as it moves into the darkness, candles
held high...


<b>ANTHONY
</b>
Bringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down --
<b>SNAPP!!!
</b>Everybody stops at the sound.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWhat was that?

Anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a--

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttMan trap.

They lower their candles.  Look to:

<b>THE FLOOR
</b>
Interspersed throughout the timbers --
Spring jawed, steel toothed, BEAR TRAPS.
Rusted.  Open.  And all around them.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttIn case anyone tried to get in and
tttamper with the technology.

The four of them are standing in the middle of a mine-field of
man traps.  Nobody moves.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWhat do we do?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttDon't move.  Don't breath.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWe can't just stand here and wait.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttFloor's too unstable to try to walk
ttaround them.

John pulls a loose board from the corridor wall.
Turns and kneels at the trap in front of him.
Pokes the end of the board into the jaws...
<b>SNAP!!
</b>
The others jump at the sound --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttJohn - what are you doing?

John pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws.
Moves to the next trap --
Snap!!

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHe's thinking like a leader.  Everyone:
ttGrab wood.  Spring the traps.  Clear a path.
tt      (proud of him)
ttGood work, Father John.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBrother.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttBrother.  Let's go.

Ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her.  
Exposes a bit of the surface underneath --
It's METAL.

She touches the cool, familiar material.  Smiles.
Now she knows this is not a dream.
She turns and SPRINGS the trap in front of her --
<b>SNAP!!
</b>

<b>THE FOUR
</b>
Slowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a
candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in
front of them... SNAP-SNAP...SNAP. SNAP.
walking carefully around the yet unfired traps....


<b>THE DOOR TO THE TECHNOLOGY ROOM
</b>
A huge wooden door with no knob or handle.  Looks like it could
almost be part of the wall.  John and Ripley are the first to
it.  They put down their planks and begin to feel around the
edges of the door for some purchase.
The Abbot joins them.


<b>BACK IN THE CORRIDOR
</b>
Anthony lags behind.  He senses a presence in the hallway.
Hears a sound behind him.
We see a GLIMPSE of something --
He turns towards the sound --

Empty hallway.

He thinks.  Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to the
rear... SNAP!


<b>AT THE DOOR
</b>
Ripley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls.
Ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and
exhaustion.  To get this far, and be locked out.
She feels sick to her stomach.
How long since she had food?
She looks over at John.
He is staring at her.
He turns red at being caught.  Cute.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI just - are you allright?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttTied.  Without sleep, food -- I just
ttfeel my age.
tt       (smiles)
ttFiguring hyperspace time, I'm almost a
tthundred.

She wipes her brow and goes back to knocking...

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHello?

The wall beneath his fist sounds hollow.
Fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull --
The plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons.


<b>BEHIND THE PLANK
</b>
A primitive KEYBOARD.  Circa late twentieth century.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI think this is it.

Ripley and the Abbot move over to see.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttTechnology.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYeah - a hundred years ago.  An antique.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>tt     (to Ripley)
ttGo ahead.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttGo ahead and what?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttOpen the door, woman.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI'll get to it, but listen to me --
ttyou may dress like you're living in
ttthe middle ages but you can't treat
ttme like your chambermaid, or whatever
ttMonks had.


<b>UP THE HALL - ANTHONY
</b>
Hears the sound again.  Turns.
Nothing again.
He pauses... Turns back quickly --

The wooden wall MOVES - steps forward --


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Adapted itself to look like WOOD.

It's body changes -- transmutes -- Cable-like sinew snaking
over grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio-
mechnoid alien appearance...!


<b>ANTHONY POV
</b>
The weary android sees the Alien as a conglommoration of his
many Medieval images of demons.  He hears the Alien's hollow,
raspy breath.  It glides towards him...

Anthony steps back directly INTO A TRAP as his mind goes --
<b>SNAP!!
</b>The STEEL JAWS spring shut on his left ankle.
Milky blood-fluid starts to flow.

He finds himself in the same predicament as his vision --
Ankle pinned, the Alien's appendages circling him --
He screams.  AAAAAAAAAAAARGH --!


<b>AT THE DOOR
</b>
Ripley is trying to work.  She punches numbers into the keyboard.
She is too exhausted to see straight.
They HEAR the scream --
John RUNS back --
Traps SNAPPING around him --
Ripley turns towards the sound --
The Abbot pushes her back to the keyboard --

<b>tttABBOT
</b><b>ttOPEN IT!!
</b>
Ripley knits her brows.  Forces herself to focus.
Her fingers punch the keys.


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Steps towards Anthony --
Snap-snap-SNAP-AP-!!
Traps snap closed on its tail, its legs --


<b>HALFWAY DOWN THE HALL - JOHN
</b>
<b>SNAP!!
</b>His cassock is snagged in a trap.
He TEARS right out of it --
<b>AT THE END OF THE HALL
</b>
Anthony is in the clutches of the Alien.
He WHACKS at the Beast with his staff, but his blows fall like
drops of rain on an elephant.

The Alien LIFTS him up to face him.  Anthony SCREAMS as his left
leg is stretched agsinst the tension of the trap's chain --
Blood pouring as white ribbons from his almost severed ankle.


<b>FACE TO FACE WITH THE ALIEN
</b>
Anthony drops his staff and grabs each of the alien's arms with
his own android arms.  His extra-human strength keeps them from
squeezing him any tighter, but he cannot avert his gaze from
the smooth, eyeless face.

The Alien considers him.  Its thin, almost translucent lips pull
back to reveal rows of splinter-like teeth.  The jaws spread,
making room for the distended tongue:

The Alien HISSES --
PUTS OUT Anthony's EYES with a thin stream of ACIDIC SALIVA --
Artificial skin BUBBLES AND BLISTERS --


<b>JOHN
</b>
Picks up Anthony's staff.
Begins to FLAIL away at the demon.


<b>AT THE DOOR
</b>
Ripley is getting no response from the keyboard.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWhat's wrong?!

Ripley slides the keyboard out of the wall compartment.
The wires are so old they've broken.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttShit.

She BITES the ends off the wires - spits out the insulation.
TWISTS the bare wire ends together...
Sweat runs into her eyes.


<b>JOHN
</b>
WHACKS the Alien with Anthony's staff --
Again.  Again.  The creature will not let Anthony go.
The Android writhes in its grasp, his face now a blistered,
pulpy mass, eyes gone.


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Finishes hot wiring.  The keyboard hums to life.
Her fingers FLY across the keys --


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Tail wraps around John's waist --
Pulls him towards it --
LIFTS him - turns him upside down --

Lips PULL BACK --

John's hands GROPE at the floor --

Sharp metal teeth SPREAD --


<b>THE DOOR KEYBOARD
</b>
Lights:  CODE ACCEPTED
Ripley's head whips towards the corridor --


<b>JOHN
</b>
His hand closes around the end of one of the traps --
He brings it up --
<b>SNAP!!
</b>It SLAMS closed on the Alien's extended Tongue -!
The Beast bellows!!
Whips its head from side to side --
Can't shake off the trap --
ACID BLOOD sprays out --!
Lands as pools of FIRE on the wooden floor.


<b>THE DOOR
</b>
Opens with a strained blast of dust -- SEE-WHORCSSH!
The Abbot LEAPS inside --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIt's open!!


<b>JOHN
</b>
PRIES Anthony's ankle out of his trap.
Scoops up his staff, drags the moaning Android --
Back up the corridor --


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Stands in open Technology Room doorway --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttClose it -- close it -- it's coming -

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWe wait.  John!!

John and Anthony appear out of the shadows --
Run/hobble towards the door --


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Acid Blood DISSOLVES the traps' steel jaws.  PULLS itself free.
Head whips towards the escaping Monks -- if it had eyes they
would narrow to slits in anger --
RUNS up the hall --


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Follows John and Anthony into the Technology Room.
On the other side of the doorway: another keyboard.
She punches keys --

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttHurry --

<b>tttJOHN
</b><b>ttHURRY!!
</b>

<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Yards away -- Limping.  Hissing.
<b>ANGRY.
</b>

<b>THE KEYBOARD
</b>
Acceptance tone "bings."
The Door starts to slide down --

The Alien is feet away --
<b>INCHES...
</b>
The door seats itself closed with a solid THUD.

Ripley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden
door.  A beat.
She turns to the room for the first time and finds --


<b>WINDMILLS
</b>
Real Man of LaMancha wood and cloth windmills.  Two story high
arms slowly rotating.  Moving enormous volumes of air through
the wind tunnel-like room.  As far as the eye can see.
Turning, creaking.
<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>But no electronics.  No radio.  No weapons.
This is the Technology Room.

Ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness.  

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. SULACO ESCAPE SHIP #4 (DREAM)
</b>
Yellow warning lights PULSE.  Those goddamned STROBES are
flickering on and off.  Steam blasts out overhead pipes.

The blue-spark pilot light muzzles of a FLAME THROWER shyly
pokes out from behind a console.  It's owner cautiously
follows...


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
She's breathing heavy.
She's wearing a sweat soaked tank top.
Her eyes flit from side to side.  Then up.  Then down.
She pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod.
She silently crosses the distance to Newt's sleep tube:


<b>IN THE TUBE
</b>
Newt sleeps peacefully.
Ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers.
Her grip TIGHTENS in the Flame Thrower in her hands.
She flips a switch to HI HEAT.
Moves around the sleep tubes...

A noise to her left.
She WHIRLS --

Pulls the trigger on the flame thrower -- click.  Nothing.
She tries again -- a half-hearted burp, but no flame.
She begins to panic --

Senses the Alien's presence.
Looks left, right, up - no Alien...
Looks down:

The Alien's tail is COMING UP BETWEEN HER LEGS.
She turns --

Right into it's grasp.
The useless flamethrower SKITTERS across the floor.
She PUMMELS the beast with balled up fists.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNo.  NO!  I beat you!  I beat you mother
ttfucker!!

The Alien spins her -- pushes her over across the sleep tube --
Like it's taking her from behind!

Ripley looks down into the sleep tube:

Newt is gone.
Her doll's head lays in a pool of blood.
The Alien wraps his arms around Ripley.
Thin lips pull back for a kiss.

She SCREAMS.


<b>INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - REALITY - DAY
</b>
Ripley opens her eyes.
<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>She's still in the room with the windmills.
Somehow this place seems less real than her dream.
She looks around:

John is sitting next to her, writing on a piece of parchment.
He smiles a relieved smile.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI thought we'd lost you.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat are you writing?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttLast will and testament.
tt      (beat)
ttJust kidding.

She looks to her left:
Anthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around his
eyes.  His ankle is a swollen mess.  Wires are hanging out.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIs he --?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttResting.
tt      (shakes his head)
ttHe'll be fine.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttNo I won't.  He's a terrible liar.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI'm sorry.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttIt's ironic.  I guess my visions were
ttprescience after all.  How will I ever
ttresolve that with my artifical con-
ttscience?

A creaking floorboard to Ripley's right draws her attention to
The Abbot.  He's pacing.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttDo you see what you've delivered us
ttinto?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYeah.  Lead me not into temptation to
ttkick your -- ahh --

Ripley tries to stand - her head spins.
<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>
<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttOh shit.

The entire room THROBS with the rhythm of the wind.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhere is the Big Boy -?

The Abbot points to the door.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttOn the other side of that door.
ttWaiting for us to starve to death.

Ripley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIt's playing with us.  It could get in
tthere any time it wants.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWhy should he enter?  He knows that one
ttof the people in this room is in league
ttwith him.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttSir.  We're all in the same coracle, so
ttto speak.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttMaybe more than one of us.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttLet's talk about the facts, Mr. Abbot.

She looks at the windmills.
<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>
<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThis is your technology?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttEven this is forbidden to us.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWell then, the facts are that we're screwed.

She moves into the room.  Walks around one of the Windmills.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAn Eco system.  Nothing to recycle your
ttatmosphere except the green plants.  Winds
ttgenerated down here --
tt     (looks at the floor)
ttWindmills use the natural surface winds
ttto turn wheels underground, create tides
tton the seas to recirculate your water...

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttMore than that.  There are pumps beneath
ttthe floor - I can feel their vibration.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttProbably pumping this air through charcoal
ttfilters.

<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>
<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIt gets colder all the time here, right?

John looks at her questioningly.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYes...

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYour wood burning fires throw soot into
ttthe atmosphere, building the cloud layer -
ttcutting off the sun's rays - cooling the
ttplanet, forcing you to burn more wood.

<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>
<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThe Greenhouse Effect.  It's how the Earth
ttalmost destroyed itself in the late 20th
ttcentury.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttDon't you see?  This is a planet set to
ttself destruct.  Not in ten minutes or two
tthours but soon.  Your atmosphere here is
ttfinite.  If the plants die the fires will
tteat up all the oxygen - this planetoid
ttwill be dead - Everyone will die.

The Abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last 
few meters of a Marathon.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttIt's here.  I was just hoping I would be
ttdead long before it came to this.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWe're supposed to die here.  That's the point.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWait a minute -- you were exiled --?

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttThe punishment for our crime was death.

Anthony sits up.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThis planet is the supreme triumph of
ttplanned obsolesence.  A certain amount of
ttprimitive materials with an atmosphere
ttprocessing system as fragile as a real
ttenvironment but not replenishable.

The Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes...

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttPoetic justice for the anti-technologists.
ttThe Company's best work.  You know, I used
ttto be a corporate executive.  Middle range
ttV.P.  Then my wife got hit by a speed craft.
ttI chucked it all and joined the order.
ttBe a monk -- see the world.  Being here,
ttbeing chairman of the board...

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNo, now I understand why I landed here.
ttTo join you happy lunatics in your 
ttdeaths.

Ripley moves away...
John starts after her.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttRipley, wait --

The Abbot stands, blocks his way.

<b>tttABBOT
</b>ttWhere can she go?  She's trapped.
tt       (beat)
ttTrapped inside her own prison.  A prison
ttin her mind.  Inside her mind.  Dancing.
ttSparklets of light - dance with the june

John and Ripley turn to look at the Abbot.
He begins to speak faster.  Faster.
He shakes.  Vibrates is more accurate --
A trickle of BLOOD runs from his left ear...

<b>SPLORTCH-KT--!!
</b>The Abbot's HEAD EXPLODES --!!!
Like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement.
Blood, bone, hair and brain matter SPRAY John.
John SCREAMS.


<b>A HORRIBLE ALIEN HEAD BURSTER
</b>
Is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the Abbot.
It keeps it's hold on the Abbot's spinal cord -- The Abbot's
body continues to stagger around, arms jerking mechanically as
lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way
through the system.

Ripley SCREAMS.
The Infant Alien-headed corpse stumbles towards her --
She plucks Anthony's staff from the floor and SWINGS --
-- Like a child hitting a baseball from a TEE --
<b>WHACK-K -!!
</b>BLASTS the Chest/head burster across the room --

It hits the floor SCRAMBLING.  Scuttles down into where the
Windmills meet the floor.  Disappears.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttBASTARD!!  It came out of his fucking
tthead!

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttI didn't have to see that to know what
ttthat means.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHe sent him to us.  That bastard outside.
ttI can't get away from him.  He's fucking
ttwith my mind.  He's my punishment!

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttI'm confused.  Before you said it came out
ttof the torso, not the head --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI don't feel like a discussion of Alien biology.

John comes up next to her.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttRipley, don't --

She pushes him away and sinks to the floor.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI should just wait for the air to run out...

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI believe - I know - that we can win --
ttthere is an answer in our books.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYour books?  Your books are gone, Brother.
ttYour world is gone.  Once that thing starts
ttto lay its eggs, all your brothers - if
ttthey aren't already - are dead.

<b>tttJOHNt
</b>ttIf that's true, then all of us, the books,
ttare consigned to ashes.

He clasps his hands and bows his head.
The Abbot's blood drips off his hands.
Plip - plop!
Into a little puddle at Ripley's feet.
She stares at the blood.  Aahk.
Feels the PAIN again.
Runs her hand across her chest...

<b>tttANTHONY O/S
</b>ttRipley?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttThere are several inconsistancies between
ttthis and the other Aliens you described.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttGive it up.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttI think this is important.  This may help
ttus fight it.  The creature that I fought
ttin the hall - when I first saw it, it had
ttcamoflaged itself to look like wood.

Ripley looks up.
<b>ttt
</b><b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWood?  When I saw it in my room it looked
ttthe way it did before -- black, mechanical --
ttunless that was a dream.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttI don't think it was.  I think that this 
ttcreature, if it is the efficient predator
ttthat you say it is, has the ability to
ttadapt to its environment.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThen the reason they've always looked the
ttsame to me is that I only ever saw them in
ttthe same environment.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttOr this may be an as yet unseen stage of
ttdevelopment -- you saw a queen -- This
ttcould be like a King ant -- more highly
ttadvanced than the drone, bred for 
ttsurvival -?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHow does this explain the thing that came
ttout of the ewe's chest?  The Abbot's head?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttMaybe it can deposit different types of
tteggs.  The chest burster is probably
ttdormant until the host eats - The first
ttone I ever saw came out of Kane after he
ttstarted to eat --

And in one horrible moment she realizes:
She hasn't eaten.  The pain in her chest...

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNo.

Anthony "looks" towards her - does he realize as well?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNo what?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNo, we're not beat yet, Father --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBrother --

Ripley gets up.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttBrother.  Not yet.  If he's taunting me,
ttthen maybe we can use that.  We can beat
ttthis bastard.  We can get to my ship.
ttWe can live.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM
</b>
John stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the 
ceiling.  Holds a torch.
Ripley is on the ground with Anthony, his injured leg splayed 
out in front of him.  Skin is palid.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttDon't have second thoughts.  Blind and
ttcrippled I would only slow you down.
ttGive him time to figure out what you're
ttdoing.  Just leave me my staff.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttOkay.  Good luck.

She shakes his hand.  He pulls her closer.
Anthony's empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at Ripley.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttRipley, I know.  Good luck.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttSit tight.

Ripley crosses to John.  Poised at the bottom of the ladder they
look up at the trap door on the ceiling.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHe could be waiting on the other side
ttof that door.  We might not get ten feet
ttbefore he kills the three of us.

He shakes his head.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe had better go, then.

He smiles.
She smiles back.
They move up the ladder.

It leads up a damp, short shaft, walls GREEN with algae, to


<b>AN UNDERGROUND DOCK - NIGHT
</b>
The ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier.  Ripley and John
climb out onto the wooden structure.  Before them:

AN UNDERGROUND SEA stretches the width of the entire planet,
over five miles across.  The floor of the lowest level of the
top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred
feet overhead.

The water sparkles with a golden glow.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttMust be day on the surface of the planet.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhere is the light coming from?
<b>t
</b><b>tttJOHN
</b>ttMirrors.  Reflect the outside light down
ttgreat shafts -- through lenses.  That's
ttwhat they make in the glass factory. 
ttLenses.  Look --

She turns:

<b>A HUGE WATERFALL
</b>
Lit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours
into the sea a short distance from them.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttOpens to the surface.  Water flows in
ttand out.  I don't know how.  There's one
ttat either end.  I came down on the other
ttside.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat do we do?

John points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at
the end of their ropes.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe cross.


<b>INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DAY
</b>
Anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the
bottom of one of the windmills.  He winces as he prods his
tender ankle with the end of his staff.  It SPARKS.
The large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head.
The wind blows through his hair.
<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>Feels good.

Anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes."

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttNow the seer can only see what God wants
tthim to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks
ttand I've finally found religion.

A floor board CREAKS.
Anthony strains to hear:

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttJohn?  Ripley?

<b>WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
</b>He knows it is not.

<b>tttANTHONY
</b>ttWell come then.  I haven't got forever.

A shadow falls across his face.  He can feel it.
He doesn't have to see what is here.


<b>THE UNDERGROUND OCEAN - DAY INTO NIGHT
</b>
The leather boat makes its way across the sea.
John rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft.
As night falls she takes the oars.

The Ocean is dead calm.  The coracle glides across the glass-
like surface.  John flexes his scarred fingers.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYour hands okay?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThey'll be fine.  You've been on
tta boat before.

Ripley squints ahead of them.
The ocean seems to go on forever.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI was a warrant officer on a ship --
ttbut I did all my sailing in space.

<b>tttJOHNtt
</b>ttFather Anselm used to take me on his
ttcoracle when I was little.

Ripley leans forward - scans his face.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHow old were you when they towed
ttthis satellite out here?t

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttFive.  The Abbot said they put us to 
ttsleep for the thirty years it took
ttto get here.  We've had almost forty
ttmore.  Until now.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat happened to your mother?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNever had one.  I mean, never knew her.
ttI mean, I did, once.  She left my father
ttwhen he joined the movement.  If she
tthadn't I wouldn't be here.  They kept
ttthe other children with the women, on
ttEarth.  That was too long ago now.  Like
tta dream.

Ripley's face grows strangely dark.  She turns to the water.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttDid you know that I was a mother?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThe girl in the ship with -?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNo.  On Earth.  I never mentioned my
ttdaughter.  My daughter.  I have - had
ttI guess, by now - a daughter on Earth.
ttKathy.  She was nine when I signed on to
ttthe Nostromo.  Mommy will be home before
ttyou know it I said.  My shares would have
ttset us up good.  Then I lost sixty years
ttfloating around in a rescue pod.  Thanks
ttto the Alien.  I came home to face a bitter,
tt70 year old woman.  My daughter.  A little
ttgirl who's mother never came home.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttJesus Christ.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThey said I should have been happy to be
ttalive.  Funny, huh?  That's why I went
ttback the second time.  Not so I could
ttfight it -- You can't fight it -- So
ttI could let it kill me.

She rubs her chest --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou didn't choose to get lost in space.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThanks for the try Father --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBrother.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttBrother, but I'm not looking for absolution.
ttI couldn't be a good mother to my daughter.
ttI couldn't be a good mother to Newt.  But
ttI can be a good mother to you.  I can make
ttsure you survive.

Suddenly they feel rain --
Ripley holds out her hand.
Her eyes open wide at what she sees.
John takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side:

The Ocean has become red with BLOOD.
Blood DRIPS down from the ceiling around them.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttBlood.

John looks up.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttFrom the levels above.

His face goes white.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHe must have slaughtered all --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttDon't think about it.  Don't think about
ttwhat's up there.  Just row.

As Ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples move
across the surface.
She doesn't notice.


<b>A SHAPE
</b>
Passes underneath the boat.  A swimming CREATURE.  The Alien.
Thanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears HUGE.
Dwarfs their coracle.


<b>INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
All the windmills are BURNING.
Flaming arms lazily turning.
Anthony is not in sight.
Whoosh...Whoosh...


<b>THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN - NIGHT
</b>
Another dock with ladders going up and down.
Ripley and John climb out of the coracle.
Don't waste time tying off.  They go  --


<b>UP THE LADDER
</b>
A hundred foot climb.  The wood is twisted.
Rungs have been torn away in some places.
They pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest
foothold.  The temperature rises as they do.
Sweat runs into their eyes.

Soon they can see the floor above them:
BLACKENED by intense heat.
They climb.


<b>INT. UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELDS - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley and John come up from the level below.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHoly shit.

John crosses himself.

Another testament to the terrible battle with the Alien.
Reduced to just a huge, blackened floor.
All the crops burned to ash --
Their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted Monks.
Their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead --
Ripley would puke if she had any food in her body.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThere's Andrew.  And Raphael.  Peter...

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttStop.  How far?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe're right below the Abbey now.

They cross the smoldering field.
The scorched floor threatens to give way under John's feet --
Ripley pull him to one side.


<b>THE MONASTERY LEVEL
</b>
Heaven has become HELL.
The ground, the buildings, the Sky-timber - all blackened.
FIRES burn everywhere.  Air choked with gray smoke and dust
pouring in from the Orbiter's surface through rends in the
vaulted ceiling.


<b>RIPLEY AND JOHN
</b>
Climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's 
hinges.  They look at the grim tableau:

Monks impaled on their own pikes.
Tangled together in their own pungy stakes.
Alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies.


<b>THE MONASTERY
</b>
Flickering fires lit the first few floor windows.
Ripley takes a step towards it --
Reaches back and pulls John...


<b>INT. GLASS FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
The Glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow.
Small fires burn out of control around the room.
Finished glass pieces BURST from the heat.
Ripley and John enter.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThis is the glassworks.  They have
tttools here --
ttt(spots)
ttKyle --

He runs across the room --


<b>BROTHER KYLE
</b>
Sits calmly at the Marver table.
He places playing cards on the table in front of him.
Solitaire.  
He sings to himself quietly.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>tt     (sotto)
ttCan't see my baby.
ttDon't see my baby.  Bay be.

John grabs him by the lapels - pulls him to his feet.
The playing cards fall to the floor --
Kyle watches them, not John.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttKyle.  Brother Kyle.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttCards on the floor, fifty two pickup.
ttBlack king on red queen, put the
ttace up --

John SHAKES him.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttKyle goddammit!

Ripley moves closer.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttJohn - it's too late --

Kyle begins to sing faster.  Faster.

<b>tttKYLE
</b>ttAce up.  Put the ace up.  Redaceupup.
ttBlackaceup.Up.Pup-pup-pup-chaka-
ttboomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma
ttlooma --

Ripley and John look at each other.
They know what this means.
John pulls a length of rope off a nearby table.
Moves in front of Kyle.  Looks into his glassy eyes.
A tear runs down his cheek.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttKeep singing, my friend.

John loops the rope around Kyle's neck.
Strangles him.
Eases the lifeless body to the floor.
Stares at it.


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Pulls a blowing iron from the rack.  Feels its weight and
balance.  A reasonable weapon.  She crosses to John.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI killed him.  I'm a doctor and I
ttkilled him.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou had to.  You're supposed to end
ttsuffering.

She hands him a pontil, a pointed iron spear used to form the
molten glass shapes.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttLet's get the hell out of here.


<b>INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley and John move up the stairs.
Flickering orange lit from below.
Smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors.


<b>INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
They enter carefully.  The room is exactly as John left it,
books out of shelves, hanging on their chains.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHe's made a mess.

John pushes ahead of her.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNo.  He hasn't been up here yet.  I 
ttdid this.

He moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open
the lock --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHere - philosophy - we'll start here --

<b>AAAROO --!
</b>A HAIRY BLUR flies out from between the stacks --
WHUMPH!  Knocks John to the floor --
Licks his face.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttMattias!

The happy dog leaps all over his master.

<b>tttJOHNtt
</b>ttHe waited.  Ripley, this is Mattias.  My
ttdog.  Good fellow.

Ripley crosses to them.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI'm glad.  Really.  But we've probably
ttonly got a few minutes before this
ttentire place goes up in flames.  Just
ttgrab whatever books you want and --

Ripley leans in to pet Mattias.
Mattias draws his lip back.  Growls.
He's looking over Ripley's shoulder.

She turns around slowly...


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Standing in the open doorway.
It's in bad shape from the man traps.
Lost a foot.  Tongue hanging out, useless.
Parts of it look like wood.  Parts of it look like wheat.

It carries Anthony's waterlogged, limp body --
POPS off his head like a grape from the bunch.
Tosses the corpse at Ripley's feet.

I could swear it's trying to smile.


<b>RIPLEY AND JOHN
</b>
Back against the book stacks.
John grabs Mattias' collar.
The Dog GROWLS at the Alien intruder...

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttEasy, boy...

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIs there another way out?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNot that will do us any good.


<b>THE ALIEN
</b>
Limps into the room dragging one foot.
It's breathing is labored.  Dripping acid blood leaves a thin
trail of fire behind it.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe hurt it.

The Alien draws itself up to its full height --
Even wounded it is one dangerous mother fucker.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttYou wanna give it a bandage?  Look --
ttWhere is my ship from here?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttOn the roof directly above this room.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHere's the plan --
<b>tt
</b><b>tttJOHN
</b>ttBut the books --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttForget the books!

<b>RUFF!!
</b>Mattias pulls free from John's grasp --
Runs to the Alien --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttShit.


<b>MATTIAS
</b>
Snaps and barks at the Alien --
Leaping about to dodge its claws.
Draws its attention --


<b>RIPLEY AND JOHN
</b>
RUN at the Alien.
It is trying to spear the dog with its tail.
John swings the iron rod -- THWAP -!
HITS the Alien across the back of its bulbous head --

It turns to him --

<b>SPLIIIITCH -!
</b>Ripley SHOVES the blowing iron into the Alien's torso.
His acid blood SPURTS out the end of the hollow tube --
SPLATTERS Ripley's cassock - she TEARS it off --

John grabs Mattias -- pulls him back.

The Alien SPINS in a circle --
Blood SPRAYING around him -

Creating a CIRCLE OF FIRE about him --
IGNITING the books --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNo!  THE BOOKS!!

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttDon't --!

John steps forward -- Ripley grabs for him --
The ACID EATS through the wooden floor --


<b>THE FLOOR COLLAPSES
</b>
The Alien, John and Ripley PLUMMET down -!
THROUGH the next floor --


<b>INTO THE GLASSWORKS
</b>
The Alien FALLS into the molten glass vat --
SCREECHES - arms flailing as it sinks beneath the surface of
the thousand degree liquid.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Finds himself HANGING over the bubbling glass vat - Caught -
DANGLING on the Flying Fox rope.  Five feet away - the ledge the
Flying Fox is launched from.  He looks down:

He can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him.  To its
right, the Water DUMP TANK - a large wine cask-looking affair
where finished pieces are cooled.  He looks up:

Ripley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttAre you all right?

Ripley grunts an affirmative response.
At least is she falls, it will only be a twenty-foot drop to
the floor.  John is looking at instant par-boiling.
John starts to move hand over hand UP the rope.  He begins to
sweat.
A drop of sweat falls...
<b>HSSS!
</b>POPS AND SIZZLES as it hits the surface of the molten glass --


<b>RIPLEY
</b>
Tries to pull herself up to the floor above --
The next level is a raging fire.

She can only hang and DROP.  She DOES -!
Falls the two stories.
Bends her knees and ROLLS on impact.


<b>JOHN
</b>
Has reached the ledge overlooking the furnace.
He stands.  Sees Ripley slowly rising --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttRipley -!

Ripley shakily gets to her feet.
Hops on one foot.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttAargh.  I'm fine.  Let's get the fuck
ttout of --

<b>SUDDENLY
</b>
THE ALIEN'S head breaks the surface of the molten glass.
SCREAMING.  STEAMING.  It is white-hot -
translucent -- covered with -- 
It looks like MOLTEN GLASS!!

Hook-like hands grasp the edge of the tank --
It tries to climb out --

Ripley turns to run.  Tender ankle gives out.
She falls face down on the floor --
Rolls over --

THE ALIEN is going to climb out of the vat --
She SCREAMS --


<b>JOHN
</b>
Grabs the Flying Fox handle.
SWINGS down the rope - across the room --
PAST the Alien --

It turns away from Ripley -
She scrambles across the floor...

John lands HARD.
Points --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttRipley - the lever!!

Ripley looks next to her:  a burning wooden lever.

The Alien has one foot out of the glass furnace --

RIPLEY grabs the lever -- Hssssst!
Putting out the fire with her hand --
Pulls --


<b>THE HUGE DUMP TANK OF WATER
</b>
DUMPS.  Empties a thousand gallons --
RAINS DOWN on the Alien. 
It HOWLS in pain --

The Molten Glass instantly COOLS --
The rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to
BE-THWOOOoooOOM -!!
EXPLODE into a million pieces...!!!!

Ripley helps John off the floor.
They are battered.  Bloody.
They look into the vat.
The steam clears...

The room is littered with Alien Bits.
Each piece is encased in glass --
Trapped like a fly in amber.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttSaw that happen to a bottle once.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>tt    (panting)
ttBeat... Beat him - ugh --

She grabs her stomach as her knees give out.
John gives her an arm for support.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWe've got to get to the Library --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttDon't worry.  Ship.  Just --

They look up:

Mattias looks down through the hole in the floor.
<b>BARKS...
</b>

<b>INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
An INFERNO.
Every bookshelf ablaze.  The floor dotted with pools of flame.
Ripley and John are at the door - held back by the heat --

John tries to enter the room --
Ripley grabs him --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttDon't be stupid --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttSome of them!  I've got to save some of
ttthem!  Mattias!!

Mattias yelps in response.  Threads his way through to them.
Ripley spins him to face her.  Tears stream down his cheeks.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThey're lost.  You did your best.  If
ttyou get out, it wasn't in vain.
ttWe've got to live!!

She YANKS him into the hallway --

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. MONASTERY - THE ROOF - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley's good foot KICKS down the burning planks that surround
the escape ship.  John and Mattias stand behind as she climbs
through to the ship.  John looks around:

The ABBEY LEVEL is devastated.  The air is filled with smoke.
The Abbey is burning.  The Library is in flames.

John looks down at his medical bag.
Torn, bloody, scorched, it still hangs from his shoulders.
Inside: The only remaining book.

<b>tttRIPLEY O/S
</b>ttCome on in!

John and Mattias step through --


<b>INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 - NIGHT
</b>
Ripley CLICKS on the lights.
John lifts Mattias into the hatch.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThe Library --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI told you -- the Earth is still there --

Ripley checks an instrument:  Elapsed travel time.
Her brows knit.  She TAPS the gauge.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNot working.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWhat does that mean?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIt means I don't know how long I was
ttin hyper sleep.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttIt means the Abbot could've been right --
<b>tt
</b><b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIt means my clock isn't working.  We have
ttto get out of here.  Even if he was right
ttthis ship's onboard computer is filled 
ttwith man's knowledge.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNot everything.  Some things will be
ttlost forever. 

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttThen man starts over.  He's done it
ttbefore.

She pushes a few buttons.  Somewhere under the floor a 
propulsion source HUMS to life.  THROBBING through the soles
of John's feet.  Ripley is absorbed in her work.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttOkay.  The seals weren't broken so
ttwe're probably clear.  But those dead
ttmonks out there are going to start
tthatching soon.  Let's get ready to

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWhat can I do?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttHere, I need a compressor tank from
ttin that compartment.

She motions towards an open door.
John enters the compartment.
Whoosh-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHey!  What?!

He looks out the window in the door.  

Ripley is staring at him, punching keys on a pad next to the
door.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttHey - I'm locked in.

Mattias scratches at the door.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI know.  I locked you in.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI'm not going with you.  I've got one

</b>ttWhat?!  You can't --

She runs a hand across her midsection.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI figured it out.  That's why it didn't
ttkill me.  He must have impregnated me
ttwhen I was in the stasis tube.

ttIt hasn't come out yet because I 
tthaven't eaten, It's still dormant.  So
tteither I eat and it kills me or I don't

John pulls the Medieval Tome out of his medical bag.

<b>tttJOHNt
</b>ttMy book -- I know what to do --

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat, an exorcism?  No good.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou can't do this.  Ripley - listen

He pounds his fists against the door.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttNO!  No, Goddammit - you can't do this.
ttYou can't let it win.

She turns away from the door.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttIt always wins.  We killed it, but it's

ttIf I can keep you alive it'll make up

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttListen to me!  You have to let me try!

She's listening...

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttI told you Father Anselm raised me.

<b>A MEDIEVAL ETCHING.
</b>A Monk vomits up the devil.

Pull back as John lowers Ripley to the pod floor.
John closes his eyes.
Closes the book.

He pours some water into a small plastic cup.
Retrieves a small pouch of herbs.  Opens it.
Wrinkles his nose - they smell --
pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhat is this stuff?

<b>tttJOHN
</b>tt     (forceful)
ttSomething that will make you well.
ttSomething that will make you sick.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttI don't --

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttShut up and drink.

He lifts the back of Ripley's head --
FORCES the drink down her throat.

John swings his leg over her midsection.  STRADDLES her.
Presses his two hands together in prayer.
Then balls them into one fist.
Takes a deep, preparatory breath...

Ripley starts to GAG -- Cough.
Her body starts to JERK --

John BRINGS HIS FIST DOWN INTO HER STOMACH --
<b>WHAMM -!!
</b>
Ripley CONVULSES -- has the dry heaves --

<b>WHAM!  WHAM --!
</b>John PUMMELS Ripley's diaphragm!

She sputters -- VOMITS a thick mucous-like substance --
<b>HEAVES --
</b>
Ripley's back arches --
She SCREAMS a gut wrenching WAIL --
Her torso BULGES as the creature is forced upwards.

John BEARS down --
Pushes UP under her ribs --
FORCING the chest-burster up her throat --

Ripley fights for air as the alien STOPS halfway up her 
esophagus -- She's choking --

John crosses himself -- takes a deep breath --
Lowers his mouth to hers --
Inhales.  Exhales.  CPR.


<b>THE ALIEN CHEST BURSTER
</b>
SLITHERS out of Ripley's mouth --

<b>INTO JOHN'S!!
</b>Reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet.

John falls back against a computer console.
Gagging.  Fights to speak.

Ripley raises herself up on one elbow.
Alien mucous drooling down her chin.
Hair matted against her forehead.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttWhy?
<b>t
</b><b>tttJOHN
</b>ttChoking.  It was the only way.

He drops the open book in front of her:
She sees the etching.

Gulps back the oozing slime.
Struggles to his feet.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttThey knew.

</b>ttBut you --

Ripley tries to stand - to go after him --
She can't sit up -- feels like a rib might be cracked.

</b>ttThat's idea.  Join...my brothers.  If

He draws the parchment out of his bag.
Drops it to the floor.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttYou... are from the real world.

He starts to step through the door --
Mattias tries to follow.

<b>tttJOHN
</b>ttStay -- both of you.

He exits the Pod.

Ripley drags herself across the floor.

<b>tttRIPLEY
</b>ttNo - wait!  John!

To the Door.  Looks out:


<b>BROTHER JOHN
</b>
Dawn's rays are peeking through the battered ceiling as he
walks slowly across the smoking roof.
Into the inferno that is the burning Abbey.

Ripley watches as John and the alien horror inside him are
<b>INCINERATED.
</b>
The heat of the flames grows.
She must pull back --
Reaches up for the door handle.
It closes with a THUD.

She rolls onto her back.
She weeps.  For the first time in years.
She's been absolved.

CREeeek -!!
The escape pod SHIFTS.
Ripley's eyes SNAP open --

The Roof beneath the Pod is beginning to GIVE WAY.

Ripley rolls onto her stomach and drags herself to the
pilot's chair.  Pulls herself into the seat.
Straps herself in --

Blasts THROUGH the wooden outershell of the Orbiter Arceon.

Ripley places Mattias into the Hyper sleep tube.
Rubs under his chin.  Is about to climb in with him when she
spots something on the floor --


<b>JOHN'S PARCHMENT
</b>
Ripley picks it up and unrolls it.
She hears John's voice:

<b>tttJOHN V.O.
</b>ttI, Brother John Goldman of the orbiter

ttboth to try to warn the others and get

ttclue as to how to battle this evil, or
ttat least to make my peace for not
ttdefending her.  She believes there is
ttstill and Earth and I hope she is right.
ttI hope she will be able to find out.
ttI hope she can find some rest for the
ttdevils that torment her.

Ripley looks at the elapsed time counter on the command
console.  Pulls a pen from it's holder.  She adds:

<b>tttRIPLEY V.O.
</b>ttWhether the Earth exists or not, whether
ttwe end up in Heaven, or Hell, or the cold

She sets her course.
Gets back into her tube.
Closes the lid.
