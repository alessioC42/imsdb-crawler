<b>tFADE IN
</b><b>t
</b><b>1tEXT. CONSTELLATION OF ORION - NIGHT
</b>
tStars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space. 
tThe Belt of Orion is center screen, but much nearer and larger 
tthan ever seen by an Earth-bound astronomer.

tA speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen. 
tNo spaceship can be seen, but only a glowworm, a solitary sperma-
ttosoan gliding through the womb of the universe. Over this we HEAR 
tthe voice of an astronaut. He is concluding a report.

<b>ttttASTRONAUT'S VOICE
</b>tttt(o.s.)t
tttSo ends my last signal until we reach
tttour destination. We are now on automatic, 
ttta mere hundred and five light years from 
tttour base ... and at the mercy of com-
tttputers. I've tucked in my crew for the 
tttlong sleep. I'll join them presently.

<b>2tINT. CABIN OF SPACESHIP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT
</b>
tThe cabin is neither cramped nor spacious, but about the size of the 
tPresident's cabin in Air Force One. In the immediate f.g. is a console 
tof dials and switches flanked by four chairs. Only one of the chairs 
tis occupied. The astronaut's back is to CAMERA. There is a ladder 
tamidships which leads to an escape hatch. The after Dart of the cabin
tis obscured in darkness. We hear the MUSIC of a Mozart sonata emanating
 tfrom a phonograph of stereotape. The astronaut is speaking into a
 tmicrophone.

<b>ttttASTRONAUT
</b>tttWithin the hour we shall completet
tttthe sixth month of our flight from
tttCape Kennedy. By our time, that is ...

tHe pauses, looking up at:

<b>3tTWO LARGE CLOCKS - ON CABIN WALL
</b>
tOne clock is marked SELF TIME, but instead of twelve numerals it has 
ttwenty-four. One of the needles is moving very slowly.

tThe other clock is labeled EARTH TIME, and its units, like those of a
 ttachometer, are given by hundreds and thousands.

tThe largest needle of this clock makes one revolution every second.
 tOver this we hear:

<b>ttttASTRONAUT'S VOICE
</b>tttt(o.s.)
tttBut according to Dr. Hasslein theory of 
ttttime in a vehicle traveling at close to 
tttthe speed of light, old Mother Earth has 
tttaged a few thousand years since our de-
tttparture -- while we have scarcely aged 
tttat all.

<b>4tCLOSE ON ASTRONAUT
</b>
tThis is TAYLOR. He wears simple dungarees (or Churchill suit) and
 tcomfortable boots. He seems calm and pensive. Extracting the butt of 
ta cigar from the breast pocket of his dungarees, he lights it, then
 tcontinues:

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttIt may be so. This much is probable: the 
tttmen who sent us on this journey have long 
tttsince been moldering in forgotten graves; 
tttand those, if any, who read this message 
tttare a different breed. Hopefully, a 
tttbetter one.

tHe begins to roll up his left sleeve.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttI leave the twentieth century without 
tttregret. Who was it? Marshall? ... said 
ttt'Modern man is the missin 'a link between 
tttthe ape and the human being.'

tHe removes the cigar from his mouth, turns to look out through one 
tof the portholes into the astral night.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttOne final thought -- nothing scientific, 
tttpurely personal. Seen from up here, 
ttteverything looks different ... Time bends 
tttand space is boundless. It squashes a 
tttman's ego. He begins to feel like no more 
tttthan a mote in the eye of eternity. And 
ttthe is nagged by a question: ahat if any-
tttthing, will greet us on the end of man's 
tttfirst journey to a star? Are we to believe 
tttthat throughout these thousands of galaxies, 
tttthese millions of stars, only one, that 
tttspeck of solar dust we call Earth, has 
tttbeen graced -- or cursed -- by human life?
tttt(pause) 
tttI have to doubt it.

tHe extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects 
tit into the vein of his forearm. He continues speaking.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttt(sardonically) 
tttThat's about all. I wonder if Man, that 
tttmarvel of the universe, that glorious 
tttparadox who has sent me to the unknown... 
tttstill makes war against his brother., and 
tttlets his neighbor's children starve.

tTaylor withdraws the hypodermic needle from his vein and secures it in 
ta drawer of the console.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttWell then, Earthmen: A missing link 
tttsalutes you. Bless you, my descendants.

tTaylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the
 thypodermic. Then, flicking a switch Au cut off the Mozart, he rises and 
tlooks up again at:

<b>5tTHE CLOCK MARKED EARTH TIME
</b>
tThe longest needle of this clock now makes nearly two revolutions per 
tsecond. The shortest needle points to the numeral 2105.

<b>6tINT. CABIN - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR
</b>
tSpace scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness, 
tfor Taylor walks the short distance from; the console to the after 
tsection without particular effort. CAMERA FOLLOWS him, and we can now 
tsee four glass capsules, or "caskets", in the rear of the cabin. Taylor 
tlooks down at them.

<b>7-tSEVERAL SHOTS - THE FOUR CASKETS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.
</b><b>10
</b>tOne of them is open. The other three are occupied by astronauts: DODGE, 
tLANDON and STEWART. They, too, wear dungarees and boots. Dodge and 
tLandon are thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile -- America's finest. Stewart 
tis a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short. Their eyes are closed 
tand they do not appear to be breathing -- yet no undertaker could make 
tthem so alive.

<b>11tANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING TAYLOR
</b>
tHe grasps the handle of his own casket and slowly pulls himself into
 tit. Continuing SILENCE. CAMERA MOVES IN as Taylor Dulls the glass lid
 tshut and secures it. He adjusts two dials inside the capsule and lies
 tback, buckling his safety belt. CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSEUP of Taylor.
 tHis eyes are open. He seems serene, even enraptured.

<b>tt
</b>t(NOTE: Credits will appear here over a series of shots designed to
 tconvey a sense of loneliness, of separation, and of the passage of
 ttime.)

<b>ttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>12-tA SERIES OF SHOTS - A DISTANT GLOBE (MINIATURE)
</b><b>16t
</b>tWe see a strange and distant planet. At first the globe occupies but a 
tsmall area of the screen; but with each new VIEW it comes closer and
 tlooms larger, as if" observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of
 tdescent.

tThe topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own. Much
 tof it is obscured by cloud cover; even more of-it appears to be
 tcratered desert of reddish hue. We can, however, make out a few narrow
 t"green belts" and a patch of blue water.

tIn the FINAL SHOTS of this SEQUENCE we see the strange planet as it
 twould be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand
 tfeet to one thousand feet. It appears that the ship will fall into a 
tvast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles. The water is 
tblue-black, the pinnacles vermillion. (This is the Lake Powell
 tlocation, at Lone Rock.)

<b>17tINT. SPACESHIP - FULL SHOT - DAY
</b>
tFour empty pilot seats are seen in f.g., the four glass caskets in 
tb.g. We HEAR the RHYTHMIC BLEAT of a WARNING SIGNAL, a RUSH OF WIND 
tas in a rapid descent, and perhaps the ROAR OF RETROJETS. Then, a 
tgreat CRASH as the craft hits water. The whole ship shudders on impact.
 tLoose equipment falls to the cabin floor. CAMERA MOVES DOWN the cabin
 taisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and HOLDS on the four
tglass caskets. There are THREE LOUD METALLIC CLICKS as the glass 
tdomes of the caskets swing open automatically.

<b>18tCLOSE ON TAYLOR
</b>
tHe now has a full beard. His eyes come open. Instantly alert, he 
trises to a sitting position, gazing across at:

<b>19tDODGE AND LANDON - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.
</b>
tThey, too, awaken and sit up, starring at Taylor. They, too, are
tbearded.

<b>ttttTAYLOR'S VOICE 
</b>tttt(o.s.)
tttYou all right?

tThey nod.

<b>20tBACK TO TAYLOR - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
tHe glances at the casket beside his own.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttStewart?
tttt(struggling to his feet) 
tttStewart?

<b>21tCLOSE-SHOT --THE FOURTH CASKET
</b>
tIts dome remains unopened. The young woman is a skeleton in a 
tChurchill suit.

<b>22tREACTION SHOT - THE THREE ASTRONAUTS
</b>
tDodge and Landon have joined Taylor and-stare at the grinning skull 
tof their dead comrade. A low, descending HUM of equipment is heard.
 tSimultaneously the lights begin to FADE. A moment later they brighten,
 tbut not as much as before.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttThere goes our primary power. We're on 
tttauxilliary.

tA slight CRACKING sound is heard. Taylor turns quickly away and o.s.:

<b>23tREVERSE ANGLE - THE FORWARD CABIN
</b>
tA trickle of water has begun to seep through a ruptured seam in the
 tcabin. Taylor darts to a porthole and peers cut.

<b>24tLONG SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:
</b>
twater 

tThe porthole is no more than six inches above the line. In the 
tdistance we discern a shoreline of red desert.

<b>ttttTAYLOR'S VOICE 
</b>tttt(o.s.)
tttWe're in the soup. We're sinking.

<b>25tINT. CABIN - FULL SHOT
</b>
tThe leak in the seam becomes a growing spray of water. Taylor 
tturns away from the porthole, calling:

<b>ttttTAYLOR
</b>tttDodge! Read the atmosphere!

tDodge moves instantly to the ladder beneath an escape hatch and 
tmounts it. Taylor stumbles down the aisle of the rolling ship toward
 tthe console and addresses Landon, who is still staring at Stewart's
tskeleton.

<b>ttttTAYLOR
</b>tttLandon! Send a last signal.

<b>ttttLANDON
</b>tttt(dazed) 
tttWhat signal?

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttTo Earth! That we've landed!

tAs Landon lurches toward the communications equipment in f.g.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>26tEXT. TIM STRANGE PLANET - LONG PANORAMIC SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON (LONE
</b><b> tROCK, LAKE POWELL)
</b>
tWe are looking at a lifeless desert of sandstone buttes and pinnacles.
 tThere is no sign of vegetation anywhere. CAMERA PANS DOWN to a body 
tof water that could be the bay of an inland sea. The deep blue of the
 tsea contrasts sharply to the red sands of the shoreline. CAMERA HOLDS
 ton the stricken spaceship, wallowing like a beached whale a hundred
 tyards offshore. The portholes of the craft are beneath the water, and
 tonly its roof and the tail fin of its tail assembly are visible. The
 tred-hot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it.

tSuddenly a snorkel-like tube sprouts from the escape hatch, which is 
tlocated amidships.

<b>27tINT. CABIN - CLOSE ON CLOSED ESCAPE HATCH
</b>
tDodge, standing halfway up the ladder., has fastened a kit of gauges 
tto the end of the snorkel tube. He reads the dials, removes the kit,
 tsniffs the air in the tube and then, taking a deep breath, announces:

<b>ttttDODGE 
</b>tttIt's breathable.

<b>ttttTAYLOR'S VOICE 
</b>tttt(o.s.) 
tttOkay! Blow the hatch before we lose 
tttauxilliary power.

tDodge reaches for a control mechanism near the escape hatch.

<b>28tCLOSE ON TAYLOR AND LANDON
</b>
tThe spray of water coming through the ruptured seam is increasing. 
tThe LIGHTS DIM again and the SOUND of the warning signal FADES. While
tLandon fiddles with the radio, Taylor tries to get the tape recorder
 trolling, but all we hear are scrambled and unintelligible noises.

<b>ttttLANDON
</b>tttIt's no use ... there she goes.

<b>ttttTAYLOR
</b>tttForget it. Abandon ship.

<b>29tWIDER ANGLE - TIM CABIN
</b>
tThe escape hatch is now open. Taylor darts over to the ladder and
 tpasses a folded life raft up to Dodge. When Landon reaches the ladder,
 tTaylor hands him two neatly packed rucksacks, and Landon climbs 
tthrough the escape hatch. Taylor is about to follow with a third
 trucksack, then turns and crosses the cabin for a last look at:

<b>30tTHE TWO CLOCKS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.
</b>
tBoth clocks have stopped: the red needle of the clock labeled SELF 
tTIME rests on the numeral 18; the red needle of the clock marked 
tEARTH TIME rests on the numeral 3975.

<b>31tEXT. TOP OF SPACECRAFT - MED. SHOT
</b>
tDodge inflates the raft with a cartridge of compressed air and 
ttosses it into the water. He and Landon jump into the water and 
tclimb onto the raft as Taylor emerges from the hatch, Taylor slips 
tinto the water and climbs onto the raft. He and Landon begin to 
tpaddle toward shore, while Dodge immediately opens another kit and 
ttakes a sample of the water.t

<b>32tCLOSE ON THE MEN IN THE RAFT

</b>tttt(half to himself) 
tttBriny...twenty-five percent salinity. 
tttNear the saturation point.

</b>tttt(looking back)
tttShe's still sinking...

<b>33tTHE SPACESHIP - FROM THEIR P.O.V.
</b>
tOnly the radio antenna and the tip of the tail fin remain visible.

<b>ttttLANDON'S VOICE 
</b>tttt(o.s.)
tttGoing ... going...

 tThe craft vanishes beneath the water.

<b>34tCLOSE ON THE MEN IN THE RAFT
</b>
tDodge is still busy with his kit. Landon is still looking back, but 
tTaylor doesn't bother to turn his head.

<b>ttttLANDON 
</b>tttGone.

<b>ttttTAYLOR
</b>tttt(flatly)
tttWe're here to stay.

<b>35tANOTHER ANGLE - MOVING WITH THE RAFT
</b>
tThey gaze at the forbidding sandstone battlements as they near the
 tshore.

<b>ttttLANDON  
</b>tttWell? Where are we? Have any notion, 
tttskipper?

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttt(confidently) 
tttWe're some three hundred and twenty 
tttlight years from Earth. On an unnamed 
tttplanet in orbit around a star in the 
tttconstellation of Orion. 
tttt(looks off at 
ttttthe "sun") 
tttThat could be Bellatrix.

<b>36tTHE SUN - FROM THEIR P.O.V.
</b>
tLow on the horizon, seen through a dense envelope of dust particles.

<b>ttttDODGE'S VOICE
</b>tttt(o.s.)
tttToo red for Bellatrix.

<b>37tBACK TO ASTRONAUTS IN RAFT
</b>
tLandon glances skeptically at Taylor.

<b>ttttLANDON 
</b>tttYou didn't have time to check the 
ttttapes, so you don't really know, 
tttdo you?
tttt(as Taylor ignores
tttthim) 
tttWhat went wrong?
tttt(sardonically)
tttWe weren't programmed to land
tttin water.

<b>ttttDODGE 
</b>tttt(grinning) 
tttThe question, Landon, is not so much 
tttwhere we are as when we are.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>ttt(stands up in raft) 
tttWe've had a nice snooze. Let's start 
tttearning all our back pay.

<b>38tWIDER ANGLE - THE BEACH
</b>
tAs the three astronauts step out into shallow water and pull the 
traft ashore.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttTake your soil test, Dodge. I'll 
tttcheck the equipment.

tDodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill 
tfrom his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins 
tto take some subsoil samplings. Taylor begins to examine the contents
tof the three rucksacks. Landon sits down on the beach., hands around 
this knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship. During this and 
tsucceeding scenes we sense that Dodge's obsession with scientific 
tinquiry leaves him immune to fear: Landon is possibly more courageous 
tand certainly more "human," for he has many fears to control: while 
tTaylor -- detached, cool and misanthropic -- is something of an enigma.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttt(calls Dodge) 
tttGot your sensors?

<b>ttttDODGE 
</b>tttYo!

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttGeiger counter?

<b>ttttDODGE

</b>tttBut how long is a day?

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttGood question.

</b>
tHe seems not to have heard.

</b>tttt(sharply)
tttLandon! Join the expedition.

<b>ttttLANDON
</b>tttt(rising)
tttSorry... 
tttt(crossing to his kit)
tttI was thinking of Stewart. What
tttd'you suppose happened?

<b>ttttTAYLOR
</b>tttt(flatly)
tttAir leak. Died in her sleep.

<b>ttttLANDON 
</b>tttYou don't seem very cut up about 
tttit.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttIt's a little late for a wake. She's 
tttbeen dead nearly a year.

<b>ttttLANDON 
</b>tttThen we've been away from Earth for 
ttteighteen months.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttBy our time.
tttt(smiling at Landon)
tttYou've turned gray.

tLandon involuntarily touches the gray hair of his temple as Taylor 
tadds lightly:

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttApart from that, you look pretty chipper 
tttfor a man who's two thousand and thirty 
tttone years old.
tttt(casually) 
tttI read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's 
ttthypothesis. We've been away from Earth for 
ttttwo thousand years, give or take a decade.
tttt(pause) 
tttStill can't accept it, huh?

<b>ttttLANDON
</b>ttttlong pause) 
tttYou know it.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttBecause time has wiped out everyone and 
ttteverything you cared for -- they're dust.

<b>ttttLANDON 
</b>tttProve it. If we can't get back, it's still 
tttjust a theory.

<b>ttttTAYLOR
</b>tttIt's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep 
tttbetter.

tDodge enters scene. A handful of reddish sand dribbles through his 
tfingers.

<b>ttttDODGE 
</b>tttNothing will grow here .... there's just a 
ttttrace of hydrocarbons, and most of the 
tttnitrogen is locked into nitrates.

<b>ttttTAYLOR
</b>tttAny sign of dangerous ionization?

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>tttNo.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttt(rising) 
tttOkay. If there's no life here, we've got 
tttjust seventy-two hours to find it. That's 
tttwhen the groceries run out.

tHe picks up one of the rucksacks and puts it on. The others follow

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>tttWhich direction?

</b>tttt(decisively, pointing

tttThat way.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>tttAny particular reason?

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttNone at all.

tHe moves out. Dodge follows. CAMERA PANS with them. They have gone 
tonly a few paces when Taylor looks back over his shoulder and halts.

tSeveral huge boulders are dislodged, and the three astronauts run.
twildly to escape the falling rocks. When the avalanche ends, they 
tsprawl on the lifeless sands, breathing heavily and drenched with
 tsweat, surrounded by enormous boulders. Taylor looks about him.

</b>tBut your behavioral studies are another matter entirely. To suggest

</b>
tNova, at once petulant and playful, erases the WRITE with a bare foot.

tTwo gorilla guards rush in to break up the fight. One of them lashes

tother modern office equipment. Taylor sits at a desk, scribbling 
tfuriously on a sheet of paper. His leash has been removed, but not his 
tcollar. Zira stands at his elbow. Cornelius paces nervously up and 
tdown, reading a sheaf of notes Taylor has already written.

<b>ttttCORNELIUS
</b>tttFlight is a scientific impossibility.

<b>ttttZIRA
</b>tttAnd even if it weren't, why fly?
tttWhere would it get you?

tTaylor points to the floor and mouths the word "Here." He flings the 
tpaper plane he has just fashioned into the air. It describes a graceful 
tarc around the room and lands at the feet of Cornelius, who slowly 
tpicks it up, then exchanges a long glance with Zira.

<b>ttttCORNELIUS
</b>tttt(softly)
tttWell, now...

tTaylor scribbles on a piece of paper, hands it to Zira.

<b>ttttZIRA
</b>tttt(reading)
ttt'Do you have maps?'

tCornelius puts the paper plane on his desk, crosses to a wall map 
tdesigned like a window shade. He pulls it down Taylor and Zira join him 
tat the map.

<b>191tCLOSE ON MAP
</b>
tIt's not a map of the whole planet, of course, but only of that portion 
tknown to the apes. Therefore it has the antique and fragmentary aspect 
tof a map drawn by some Babylonian cartographer.

tA swatch of blue at the right margin indicates a sea. In the southwest 
tquadrant are the "greenbelts" of the ape civilization, looking on the 
tmap like jade stones strung on crescent-shaped necklace. Rubyidots in 
tthe lade indicate ape communities. The northwest quadrant, colored 
tbrown, is apparently uninhabited. East of the green belts is a patch of 
tgreen savanna, and next to it the darker green of a jungle. The eastern 
tquadrants are rendered in yellow, and except for a blue lake, appear to 
tbe lifeless desert and barren mountain. This area is marked FORBIDDEN 
<b>tZONE.
</b>
tUsing a pointer, Cornelius orients Taylor, indicating a red dot in the 
tmiddle of the green belt.

<b>ttttCORNELIUS
</b>tttWe are here ...
tttt(moving pointer)
tttYou were captured about here.

tTaylor studies the map, then pointing at the lake in the eastern 
tdesert, he goes into a brief charade, dramatizing the astronauts' 
tlanding and trek.

tttIt's probably wrong --

</b>tttThe evidence was very meager --

<b>ttttZIRA
</b>tttYou didn't think so then.

<b>ttttCORNELIUS 
</b>tttThat was before Dr. Zaius and half the 
tttAcademy said the idea was heresy.

<b>ttttZIRA 
</b>tttHow can scientific truth be heresy? What 
tttif Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? 
tttA mutation. A missing link between the

tTaylor bangs his fist on the desk, mouths the word "No!" scribbles 
tsomething on a piece of paper.

<b>ttttCORNELIUS 
</b>tttHe's touchy, isn't he?

tTaylor thrusts the sheet at Zira, who reads it aloud.

<b>ttttZIRA
</b>ttt'I am not a missing link.'

<b>ttttCORNELIUS

tHe regards the apes with hostility as they cross to him. One picks up 
this leash. Over THE SHOT we hear:

</b>tttt(o.s.) 
tttWhat's this?

tThe caged primitives are asleep. Julius, the keeper, dozes in a chair 
toutside Taylor's cage. CAMERA PIVOTS MOVING IN ON Taylor, who is lying 
ton his side, also asleep. Nova is curled up behind him. At the sound of 
ta door opening, she comes instantly awake, sitting up and clutching 
tTaylor's arm. He comes groggily awake, raising his head in time to

tfront of him, believing the animal cannot understand.

tttDr. Zira won't like it. She wants this

</b>
tAs the Lieutenant replies:

</b>tttThese orders came from Dr. Zaius himself. 
tttThere's nothing she can do about it.

tThe two gorillas exit. The guard crosses to a wall peg for a collar and

tThe heel of Taylor's right palm crashes into the keeper's, chin, nearly 
tsnapping his neck. Julius falls unconscious. Taylor leans over him, 
ttaking his night stick and a set of keys on his belt.

<b>203tREVERSE ANGLE - TO INCLUDE NOVA AND MALE IN ADJACENT CAGE
</b>
tThe male has awakened. He stares stupidly at Taylor. Nova is 
twhimpering, little strange cries of fear. Taylor moves o.s.

</b>
tHe leaves the cage, moves swiftly to the nearby door and exits.

</b>
tBarefoot, Taylor silently pads down the corridor to a locked door.

<b>206tCLOSE ON A DOOR
</b>
tWhich is visible because of a beam of sunlight from the half-open door
 tof a guard room. We HEAR a murmur of ape voices and LAUGHTER. Taylor 
tfumbles with the keys, finds one that fits the lock and opens the door.

<b>207tEXT. ANIMAL COMPOUND - MED. SHOT - TAYLOR - DAY
</b>
tHe emerges, quietly locking the door behind him. Two tethered horses
tcan be seen in deep b.g., and another gust of LAUGHTER can be heard 
tfrom the nearby guard room. Taylor looks off.

<b>208tLONG SHOT - WHAT TAYLOR SEES:
</b>
tAs already established, the animal compound is situated on the 
toutskirts of the apes' community. The strange skyline of the town can 
tbe seen in the distance.

<b>209tPANNING WITH TAYLOR
</b>
tHe starts to cross an open field outside the compound. At that moment 
twe HEAR a shrill police WHISTLE from the guard room. Taylor breaks into 
ta run.

<b>210tREVERSE ANGLE - THE COMPOUND
</b>
tAs the two gorilla officers emerge from the building and run toward 
ttheir horses.

<b>211tEXT. A DIRT ROAD - LONG SHOT - TAYLOR
</b>
tHe runs down the road, starts across the long causeway that bisects a 
tsmall lake, looking over his shoulder.

<b>ttttttttQUICK DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>212tEXT. APETOWN - LONG ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY
</b>
tThe community we sue at the end of the causeway is small and arcane. 
tThere are no power lines, no street lamps -- indeed, no streets as 
tsuch, but only a small cluster of buildings around a pleasant mall. The 
tarchitecture of the buildings is faintly derivative of the simpler and 
tless rococo work of Antonio Gaudi -- columns and pillars of brick or
 texterior masonry look like the trunks and branches of great trees and 
tsuggest an arboreal past.

tA small number of apes are visible on the mall:

tTaylor darts behind the buttress of a building, casing the situation. 
tHe looks back at:

<b>213tEXT. LAKE AND CAUSEWAY - LONG SHOT - MORNING
</b>
tThe two mounted gorilla-police can be seen on the causeway, galloping 
tstraight toward CAMERA. It is evident they will soon spot Taylor.

<b>214tBACK TO TAYLOR - CLOSE SHOT
</b>
tHe retreats from the buttress to a dark archway and vanishes inside the 
tbuilding.

<b>215tINT. A DARK VESTIBULE - MOVING WITH TAYLOR
</b>
tThe vestibule is nothing, no set required, a dark space through which 
tTaylor moves toward a shaft of light. We HEAR faintly the discordant 
tchords of an organ. Or is it an organ? At any rate,a strange and 
tmelancholy tune. Taylor arrives at a font.

<b>216tINT. A TEMPLE - PANNING WITH TAYLOR
</b>
tHe appears out of darkness into half-light. The rear of the temple is 
tobscure. Taylor darts behind a screen. Crouching there, he observes:

<b>217tA FUNERAL CEREMONY IN THE TEMPLE - MED. LONG SHOT
</b>
tThe temple itself is small and austere. There is no altar, but against 
ta plain backdrop we see a statue of the Lawgiver, a Great Ape holding a 
tbook. Below the Lawgiver is an ORANGUTAN MINISTER clothed in black 
trobes. He stands in front of a closed coffin. A dozen mourners, seated 
ton comfortable wicker chairs, form a semi-circle around the coffin. The 
tape ladies wear cowls.

<b>ttttMINISTER 
</b>tttWeep if you must, but make an end of 
tttsorrow. He lives again. Yes, he has 
tttfound peace in Heaven.

tCrouching, listening, wide-eyed.

</b>tttt(o.s.) 
tttHe was a model for us all, a gorilla to 
tttremember; hunter, warrior, defender of 
tttthe Faith.

<b>219tBACK TO FUNERAL CEREMONY - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.
</b>
tAs the minister continues his eulogy, a small ape boy detaches himself 
t(as children will) from the group of mourners and comes marching up the 
taisle toward the rear of the temple.

<b>ttttMINISTER 
</b>tttCherished husband, beloved father, 
tttgenerous master -- yes, he was a font 
tttof simian kindness.

tWho is still crouching behind the screen in deep b.g. The small fry is 
tcoming closer. Over this we hear:

tttThe dear departed once said to me:
ttt'I never met an ape I didn't like'...

tThe small fry spots Taylor.

<b>ttttCHILD
</b>tttt(shrill soprano)
tttLook!. It's a man!

tThe mourners' heads turn. Taylor slinks toward the vestibule.

</b>
tHe is aghast.

<b>ttttMINISTER
</b>tttIn Heaven's name ...
tttt(aside to ushers)
tttGet rid of that creature.

tTwo ushers rise, moving past CAMERA and o.s.

<b>222tEXT. TEMPLE - CLOSE ON VESTIBULE DOOR

tStaying close on the temple wall, Taylor moves stealthily away from the 
tvestibule door. The two ape ushers appear.

</b>
tHe runs out onto the mall.

<b>224tFULL SHOT - THE MALL
</b>
tTaylor belatedly sees that he is running straight toward his two
 tmounted pursuers. Darting off in another direction, he races past 
tstartled pedestrians.

<b>225tREACTION SHOT - TWO CHIMP PEDESTRIANS
</b>
tThey do a slow take.

<b>ttttFIRST CHIMP
</b>tttYou see what I saw?

<b>ttttSECOND CHIMP
</b>tttMust've escaped from the zoo.

<b>226tMED. SHOT - A MOUNTED COP
</b>
tHe has spotted Taylor. Drawing a folded net from his saddlebag, he 
tswings it overhead (like a cowboy with a lariat) and gallops off in 
tpursuit of the man.

<b>227-tSEVERAL SHOTS - TAYLOR AND PURSUING MOUNTIE
</b><b>231
</b>
tTaylor runs frantically from building to building, rounding corners, 
tvanishing momentarily and reappearing on another part of the mall. At 
tone point the mountie nearly overtakes him and flings his net, which 
tfalls short. Taylor runs on.

<b>232tEXT. AN AMPHITHEATER - LOW ANGLE SHOT (FROM GROUND LEVEL)
</b>
tIt is an open-air structure, like a Greek theater, located near the 
tcentral mail. Steeply tiered, it seats no more than fifty apes. The 
tdais in the pit is some fifteen feet above ground level.

tTaylor enters scene, running toward the amphitheater. Changing 
tdirection, he darts into what appears to be an access tunnel. A moment 
tlater the pursuing cop rides into' scene, dismounts and walks toward 
tthe amphitheater, looking around for Taylor.

<b>233tEXT. AMPHITHEATER - HIGH ANGLE SHOT (FROM TOPMOST TIER)
</b>
tTaylor suddenly emerges from the access tunnel and runs up a ramp 
tencircling the amphitheater. (A retaining wall shields him from the 
tview of the apes.) Pausing for breath at the top of the ramp, Taylor 
tcrouches behind the uppermost tier of seats and peers down:

<b>tTHE AMPHITHEATER - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.
</b>
tThe cop looks around, spots Taylor at the top tier, and starts up after 
thim.

tHe starts to run back down the ramp, but is suddenly confronted by his 
toriginal pursuer (the dismounted cop coming up the ramp. Reversing 
tdirection, Taylor runs around the rim of the amphitheater and vanishes 
tinto an exit tunnel. The cop blows his whistle, summoning another cop, 
twho joins him in the chase.

<b>239-tANOTHER PART OF THE MALL - A SWIFT SEQUENCE OF SHOTS

tIn which we see the fugitive, his pursuers and the reactions of ape 
tshoppers and workers.

<b>245-tEXT. OPEN-AIR MARKET - SEVERAL SHOTS
</b><b>248
</b>
tA market has been set up on one side of the mall, where street vendors 
tbehind carts or tables hawk their wares: fruits, vegetables, wearing 
tapparel, etc. As Taylor runs frantically through the market place, 
tseveral apes join the chase. In the ensuing pandemonium, like the 
tproverbial Chinese fire drill, several tables are overturned.

<b>249tEXT. A BUILDING - CLOSE ON AN ARCHWAY
</b>
tTaylor runs into scene, pauses, panting, and looks back at his 
tpursuers. Then he darts through the archway into the building.

<b>250tINT. BUILDING - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR - DAY
</b>
tFor the moment he is the sole visitor in this wing. His pace slows to a 
twalk as he and we observe fleetingly the specimens in what is a simian 
tmuseum: Possibly several stuffed and unfamiliar animals; primitive 
tartifacts and fossils; possibly the skeleton of a dog, a cat, etc. Over 
tthis we hear a shrill police WHISTLE.

<b>251tFLASH SHOT - TAYLOR
</b>
tHe runs again.

<b>252tMED. SHOT - AN APE MOTHER AND CHILD
</b>
tLooking at the stuffed animals as Taylor races past. The mother gives a 
tstartled SCREAM.

<b>253tREACTION SHOT - A MUSEUM GUARD
</b>
tHe starts after the fugitive.

<b>254tANOTHER PART OF THE MUSEUM - FEATURING TAYLOR
</b>
tHe runs past displays of other stuffed animals toward CAMERA and halts 
tabruptly in close f.g., shocked by:

<b>255tWHAT HE SEES: tDODGE
</b>
tstuffed and mounted, Dodge bares his teeth at the world.

<b>256tCLOSEUP - TAYLOR

tReacting in horror. He hears another police WHISTLE and the echoing 
tFOOTSTEPS of approaching guards, which mufffle his strangled gasp:

tTaylor vanishes in a BLUR of movement.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

</b>
tOrder has been restored in the open-air market. Taylor bursts suddenly 
tinto view from a building on the far side of the mall, running in panic 
tfrom ape guards in close pursuit. A mounted policeman spots him and 
theads him off. Changing direction, Taylor is intercepted by another 
tmounted Gorilla. And then a third.

tCAMERA HOLDS, ANGLING DOWN on the center of the mall. We are witnessing 
ta hideous game: "baiting the man."  The mounted police do not shoot or 
tclub Taylor, for he cannot escape -- but they circle him, their long 
twhips CRACKING over his head.

<b>258tCLOSER ANGLE - THE CIRCLE AROUND TAYLOR - FAVORING A MOUNTIE

twho unfolds his net, swings it overhead and flings it at Taylor. This 
ttime he bags his quarry. Taylor gives up. Spent, docile, entangled in 
tthe net, he stands stock-still in the center of the mall. Guards and 
tcivillians on foot join the circle around the man at bay. They regard 
thim warily.

tShe paws at the net, crying impulsively:

tZira removes the net from his face. Panting with exhaustion, Taylor 
tflicks a wild glance at her. He looks demented.

</b>
<b>264tINT. CAGES - CLOSE SHOT - TAYLOR AND NOVA - DAY

tThe compound is dimly lit. Taylor, the bandage now gone from his 
tthroat, is back in his old cage. The other cages, however, are empty -- 
ttheir occupants presumably having been moved to the surgery or the zoo. 
tHe is seated on a pile of straw in the rear corner, Nova's head cradled 
ton his lap. Idly he strokes her coarse hair. There is a dull glow of 
tmadness in his eyes, and his manner is one of abstract soliloquy, like 
ta man talking to a dog.

<b>ttttTAYLOR

tttthat damn Julius. No one'll listen... 
tttonly you. You...Nova. NO-VAH.

tHis manner is now more direct, and educative., but she stares in blank 
tcomprehension. She brushes his moving lips with her fingers. He shrugs 
twryly.

tttThey'll have to kill me.

tFaint footsteps are heard o.s. Taylor and Nova look in the direction of 
tthe sound. A sudden stream of water shoots through the bars and strikes 
tTaylor in the chest.

<b>265tWIDER ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE:

tback toward the rear of the cage. Julius, whip in hand, unlocks the

tdirection. She recoils. The jet of water hold Taylor at bay. Julius 
tgrabs Nova, begins to pull her toward the door of the cage. Taylor 
ttries to fight his way through the water toward Julius.

</b>tttLet her alone!

tJulius swings the whip. It cracks against Taylor's legs, biting into

tttand therefore has no rights under ape law.

tAlthough the judges and Prosecutor have been told that this man can

</b>tttMy name is Taylor.

tThe President refuses to address Taylor directly. Checking a document, 
the speaks to Zira.

</b>tttt(voice rising) 
tttThis hearing is absurd! Let me tell

tttBailiff! Make the animal be quiet.

tThe Bailiff quickly crosses to Taylor and shoves him roughly into his 
tchair.

<b>ttttPRESIDENT 
</b>tttState your case, Mr. Prosecutor.

<b>ttttHONORIUS 
</b>tttLearned Judges: My case is simple. It is 
tttbased on our first Article of Faith: that 
tttthe Almighty created the ape in his own 
tttimage; that He gave him a soul and a mind; 
tttthat He set him apart from the beasts of 
tttthe jungle, and made him the lord of the 
tttplanet.

<b>278tCLOSE GROUP SHOT - THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE
</b>
tTaylor has begun to write something on a sheet of paper. Zira and 
tCornelius remain attentive to:

<b>ttttHONORIUS' VOICE 
</b>tttt(o.s.) 
tttThese sacred truths are self-evident. The 
tttproper study of apes is apes. But certain 
tttyoung cynics have chosen to study man -

tAs the Prosecutor continues:

</b>tttThere is a conspiracy afoot to undermine 
tttthe very cornerstone of our Faith

<b>ttttPRESIDENT
</b>tttCome to the point, Dr. Honorius.

<b>ttttHONORIUS 
</b>tttDirectly, Mr. President. This wretched man, 
tttthe accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy.
tttWe know that he was wounded in the throat at 
tttthe time of his capture. The State charges

</b>ttHe can reason? With the Tribunal's permission,

</b>tttI admit, I know nothing of your culture.

tttTell us why all apes are created equal.

<b>ttttTAYLOR 
</b>tttSome apes, it seems, are more equal than 
tttothers.

<b>ttttHONORIUS 
</b>tttRidiculous. That answer is a contradiction

</b>tttt(hands paper to Zira) 
tttShow this to the President.

tZira moves toward the dais. Honorius returns to his own table.

</b>tttSince the defendant is forbidden to speak 
tttin his own defense, he asks that this

tThe inquiry group files through a door into the amphitheater. Two APES 
tstand guard over a number of leashed and nearly naked human beings in

<b>ttttZAIUS 
</b>tttt(calmly) 
tttMr. President, a word of explanation: the 
tttcreature in question suffered a skull

tttveternary surgeons under my direction 
tttwere able to save his life. But the beast 
tttcould not speak, of course. Nor will he
tttever speak

tTaylor leaps from his chair, livid with rage, approaches the dais.

tThe bailiff and a husky guard seize Taylor, who continues shouting:

</b>tttYou barbarians!

tThe powerful guard twists Taylor's arms behind his back and the bailiff 
tlashes his wrists together. Then the bailiff gags Taylor. His voice is
tcut off as the bailiff ties the twisted kerchief around his open mouth.
tThe guard holds Taylor's leash during the rest of this scene.

tMeanwhile, Cornelius has risen to his feet. His tone is firm, but 
tconciliatory.

tThe office is as unadorned and Spartan as that of Cornelius  -- in

tmany thick leatherbound books on this scholar's desk. Zaius is reading

</b>

tlike a freak animal, but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who 
tmust be intimidated by the threat of terror.

</b>tttt(offhandedly) 
tttOh, your case was preordained. In a way,

tThe two burly security agents open the door and enter.

tLucius hands the guard a document. It is dark here, so Julius crosses 
tto a beam of light near the bars and studies the document. Lucius, 
tbehind the guard's back, signals frantically for Taylor to seize or 
tstrike the guard. Taylor is slow to understand. Lucius shakes his
