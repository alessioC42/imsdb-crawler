</b>
tA restaurant supply truck is curbside, near a small 
trestaurant.  GERALD GRUNICK, forty-one, is closing the back 
tdoor of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common
tstate for him.  He moves towards the cab of the truck and gets
tinside as we SUPER:

<b>ttKANSAS CITY, MO. - 1963
</b>
<b>tINT. TRUCK - DAY
</b>
tAs he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune... now we
tREVEAL his twelve-year-old son, TOM, seated quietly beside him. 
tHe seems a bit down.  Gerald glances at his son.

<b>ttttGERALD
</b>ttI don't know a recent Saturday I've
ttsold more.  You didn't think I'd
ttsell that health restaurant, did you?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttNo.  Not even you.

<b>ttttGERALD
</b>ttWhy so glum?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttGERALD
</b>ttt(a beat)
ttGo ahead.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttNo, nothing.  I've got a problem,
ttI guess.

<b>ttttGERALD
</b>ttWere you bothering by those
ttwaitresses making a fuss?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttNo.  But, honest.  What are you
ttsupposed to say when they keep
tttalking about your looks?  I don't
tteven know what they mean -- "Beat
ttthem off with a stick."

tGerald stiffs a grin.

<b>ttttGERALD
</b>ttYou know, Tom, I feel a little
ttproud when people comment on your
ttlooks.  Maybe you should feel that
ttway.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttProud?  I'm just embarrassed that
ttI like when they say those things.

<b>ttttGERALD
</b>ttAs long as that's your only problem
ttyou're...

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttIt's not.

tHe looks directly at his father and talks quietly, and sincerely.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttI got my report card.  Three Cs,
tttwo Ds and an incomplete.

<b>ttttGERALD
</b>ttOh my.  I see you studying so hard,
ttTom.  What do you think the problem is?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttI'll just have to try harder.  I don't 
ttknow.  I will.
ttt(talking himself
ttt into it)
ttI will.  I will.  I will.

tHe shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep
ttalk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttThanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will 
ttyou sign it, please?

<b>ttttGERALD
</b>ttt(as he signs)
ttWould it help if I got you a tutor?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(suddenly hopeful)
ttThat would be great.
ttt(worried)
ttIt better help.  What can you do with
ttyourself if all you do is look good?

</b>
<b>tINT. HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
tAARON ALTMAN, looking almost preposterously young in his
tgraduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory.  He is a
trare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>tt...and finally to the teachers of
ttWhitman High School, I don't have the
ttwords to express my gratitude which
ttmay have more to say about the quality 
ttof the English Department here than 
ttmy own limitations...

tHe awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective
tdiscomfort.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>tt...that was, of course, not meant to
ttbe taken seriously.  A personal note.  
ttI am frequently asked what the special 
ttdifficulties are in being graduated 
ttfrom High School two months shy of my 
ttfifteenth birthday.  I sometimes 
ttthink it was the difficulties 
ttthemselves which enabled me to do it.
ttIf I'd been appreciated or even tolerated
ttI wouldn't have been in such a hurry to
ttgraduate.  I hope the next student who
ttcomes along and is able to excel isn't
ttmade to feel so much an outcast.  But
ttI'm looking forward to college; this is
ttthe happiest day I've had in a long
tttime.  I thank you and I forgive you.

tThis is very little applause.

<b>tANGLE ON TEACHERS
</b>
<b>ttttMALE TEACHER
</b>ttI'm always so confused by Aaron.
ttIs he brave and earnest or just
tta conceited little dick-head?

<b>tBACK TO AARON AS WE SUPER: "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS REPORTER"
</b>
<b>tANGLE ON STAGE
</b>
tAs Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
tsemi-literate high school graduates.

<b>ttttYOUTH #1
</b>ttLater, Aaron.

<b>tEXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
</b>
tClusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
tyard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
tcuff Aaron around.

<b>tCLOSER IN
</b>
tAaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth
tcovered with blood...as he gets to his feet.  He is livid --
tsomething primal triggered by this brutality.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttGo ahead, Stephen -- take your
ttlast licks.
ttt(points at his
ttt face)
ttBut this will heal -- what I'm
ttgoing to say to you will scar you
ttforever.  Ready?  Here it is.

tHe dodges as they come after him.  They catch him by the hair
tand hurl him to the ground.  As he gets up he hurls his
tdevastating verbal blow.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttYou'll never make more than
ttnineteen thousand dollars a year.
ttHa ha ha.

tThey twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the
tconcrete.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttOkay, take this:  You'll never
ttleave South Boston and I'm going
ttto see the whole damn world.  You'll
ttnever know the pleasure of writing
tta graceful sentence or having an
ttoriginal thought.  Think about it.

tHe's punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground.  As the
tYoung Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their
tconversation.

<b>ttttYOUTH TOUGH
</b>ttNineteen thousand dollars...
ttNot bad.

</b>
<b>tINT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT
</b>
tJANE CRAIG, ten years old, is in her room typing.  Above the
tdesk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
tpictures tacked to each one.  Her desk has several file racks
twhich contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes --
ta roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side.  Jane types
tvery well in the glare of her desk lamp.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(voice over; as
ttt she types)
ttDear Felatzia, it's truly amazing
ttto me that we live a world apart
ttand yet have the same favorite music.
ttI loved the picture you sent and
tthave it up on my bulletin board.
ttYou're growing so much faster than
ttI am that I...

<b>tOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tSHOWING Jane's FATHER standing near the door.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(voice over)
tt...am starting to get jealous.
ttI read in the newspapers about
ttthe Italian strike and riots in
ttMilan.  I hope you weren't...

<b>ttttFATHER
</b>ttt(softly)
ttHoney?...

tJane SCREAMS, and grabs her heart, breathing heavily, babbles
tnervously at her Dad.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttOh God -- Daddy -- don't...don't...
ttdon't ever scare me like that --
ttplease.

tWe SUPER:  "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS PRODUCER"

tHer father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction.
tFalling back towards the door:

<b>ttttFATHER
</b>ttJane -- For God's sake...
ttt(recovering)
ttLook, it's time for you to go
ttto sleep.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttI just have two more pen pals and
ttthen I'm done.

<b>ttttFATHER
</b>ttYou don't have to finish tonight.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(he doesn't get in)
ttNooo.  This way the rotation stays
ttthe same.

<b>ttttFATHER
</b>ttFinish quickly.  I don't want you
ttgetting obsessive about these 
ttthings.  Good night.

tWe REMAIN WITH Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
ttroubled.

<b>tINT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tAs Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family
troom where her Father reads the latest <u>Rolling Stone</u> of the
tmid-60's -- Hunter Thompson, the New Journalism, the slim
tJann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttDad, you want me to choose my words
ttso carefully and then you just throw
tta word like 'obsessive' at me.  Now,
ttunless I'm wrong and...
ttt(enunciating)
tt...please correct me if I am, 'obsession'
ttis practically a psychiatric term...
ttconcerning people who don't have anything
ttelse but the object of their obsession --
ttwho can't stop and do anything else.  Well,
ttHere I am stopping to tell you this.  Okay?
ttSo would you please try and be a little
ttmore precise instead of calling a person
ttsomething like 'obsessive.'

tShe advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out,
teven with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had
tenough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from 
tthe room.  She exits the room INTO BLACK.

tStay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES:

<b>tOVER EXT. SMALL MID-WESTERN CITY - DAY
</b>
tEmerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a
ttwenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a
tjacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind
tof gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours.  The
tJacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important
tnews assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else
tyet never mention.  She stops running as she feeds quarters into
tthe first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven
tdifferent papers before moving on.

<b>tINT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
tAs she enters from the bathroom, having showered and dressed.
tThe sun is jus now rising.  She sits next to her phone.

<b>tINSERT:  JANE'S ROOM
</b>
tThe Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial
thand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.  She flicks at a page --
ttakes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the
troom number of her crew and reporter.

<b>tON JANE
</b>
tAs she dials one room number.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttHi...It's me...

<b>tINT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
tANGLE ON CAMERAMAN -- his equipment in evidence though
tessentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens
tto Jane.

<b>ttttJANE'S VOICE
</b>ttt(voice over)
ttIt's thirty minutes before you have
ttto meet me in the lobby -- nudge
ttyour wife.

<b>tBACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttThere's probably no time to eat...
ttbut there's a cafeteria at the bus
ttdepot once we get down there.  I
ttlove working with you two...It 
ttsaves me a call.

tShe dales.

<b>tINT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM
</b>
tWhere Aaron is switching his TV from station to station,
tmonitoring the early morning news.  His PHONE RINGS.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttHi.  Turn on your TV...
tt<u>Good Morning America</u>, the
tt<u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all
ttabout to talk to Arnold 
ttSchwarzenegger and I think he's 
ttlive on at least two of them.

<b>tBACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttAt six o'clock on the wake-up
ttnews they used the wrong missile
ttgraphic.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttt(Austrian accent)
ttNow listen, Arnold just said that
tthe's been making three million a
ttmovie now.  But he's not ever 
ttgonna change.  He's still the same
ttperson when he was making two 
ttmillion dollars a movie.  He feels
ttno different.  He also bought a brand-
ttnew condo with Maria, they gonna
ttfurnish tastefully.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttA half hour in the lobby.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttt(Austrian accent)
ttOkay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].

tShe hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
tbed for a moment's solitude.  She sits stiffly, palms on top of
ther legs.  It looks like someone with unusually good posture,
twaiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
tredden and she begins to cry.  Now she sobs -- then miraculously
tshakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom.  This crying
tepisode is clearly part of her morning routine.

<b>tINT. BUS STATION - DAY
</b>
tJane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team
tas they train their attention on Aaron; who is getting ready to 
tdo a stand-up.  There is a DERELICT off to one side.  Aaron holds 
this microphone at the ready.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttReady.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCAMERAMAN
</b>ttYour hair's a little funny.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttIt's an ethnic curl, I can't do
ttanything about it.

<b>ttttCAMERAMAN
</b>ttIn front of a little -- it's a bit...
ttYou want a mirror?

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttNo -- Don't worry about it.  Let's
ttdo this.

tJane nods her assent.

<b>ttttCAMERAMAN
</b>ttOkay.

<b>tAARON SEEN THROUGH CAMERA
</b>
<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttIn other times, for other purposes,
ttthere might be a band and bunting
tthere at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
ttreturn from war.  He...

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttI'm sorry.  But look at how
ttwonderful his face is.

tShe points to the derelict.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttOh, you mean use him...That's
ttnice.  Okay.

<b>ttttCAMERAMAN
</b>ttI'll put him in the low corner of
ttthe frame -- good.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttIn other times, with other purposes,
ttthere might be a band and bunting
tthere at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
ttreturn from war.  Last week he was
ttdecorated by a president for heroism
ttin a war.  But it was the civil war --
ttin Angola -- and he was in it for the
ttmoney.

tHe puts the microphone down.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttThanks.

tHe passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair.

<b>tINT. GATE AREA - DAY
</b>
tJane in the distant b.g. on the phone.  Aaron and crew shooting
tas the bus pulls up, hisses to a stop and tired, rumpled
tpassengers exit the bus.  J.D. SINGER, strong, 9'6" figure
temerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him.
tHe reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary.

<b>ttttJ.D.
</b>ttGo 'way.

tJ.D. gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus.  The

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttJust a few questions?

<b>ttttJ.D.
</b>ttNo.

tHe starts walking -- the four person newsteam staying with him.

tscreens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttWhere's where I asked him about
ttbeing scared?
ttt(then)
ttYou should work on your speech.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttNo.  It makes me nervous to think

tShe consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttt(on tape)
ttAll this business of war -- do you
ttget scared?

<b>ttttJ.D.
</b>ttt(on tape; he smiles)
ttUh-uh.
ttt(then)
ttI'm a little freaked right now about

tHe laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away.

</b>ttI love that turn away.

<b>tINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

tLocal Television News Broadcasters.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(in darkness)
ttThere's a point I'm trying to make

ttI'm seventeen now and I've been

ttand I guess to be honest -- I stopped

tThe lights come up on the room.  The two screens go black...
tthere is general APPLAUSE.  Jane blinks nervously.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttPlease don't applaud.

<b>tON AUDIENCE
</b>
tSitting in groups of three -- NEWS TEAM from around the country,
tremarkably similar in comparison...a great looking woman, good
tlooking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black
tor Hispanic.  They still APPLAUD -- not yet having grasped the
tsincerity of Jane's plea which she presses with more urgency.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttPlease.  Don't!!
ttt(she yells)
ttI gathered these pieces as an
ttexample of what's <u>WRONG</u> with local

tThe applause stops.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttThe excerpts from THREE SEPARATE
ttSERIES on prostitution were
ttSIMULTANEOUSLY broadcast by all

tShe pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none,
tshe continues.  An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout
t"gesundheit" simultaneously -- they laugh.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttThe legacy of Edward R. Murrow,
ttEric Sevareid, William Shirer,
ttDavid Brinkley and Walter Cronkite
ttis being squandered in a desperate
ttpopularity contest.  Our profession

<b>tTRACKING SHOT
</b>
tAs Jane continues, REVEALING that the news team now have even
tmore in common.  They do not like Jane.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttYesterday's compliment has somehow
ttmanaged to become today's kiss of
ttdeath.  To be considered a serious
ttjournalist is no longer flattering.
ttIt presents the risk of being labeled
ttponderous, or worse yet, elitest, 
ttright?

<b>tSHOT CONTINUES
</b>
tWomen playing with their hair, young man bored...one
tmiddle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie...

<b>tON JANE
</b>
tBriefly departing from text.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttAll of you know what I'm talking about.  
ttWe're all trying to act together than 
ttwe are.  But we care.  So, we're all 
ttsecretly terrified, aren't we?

tNot a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
tprepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice
tbegins to rasp.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWe are being increasingly influenced
ttby the star system.  The network

<b>tTRACKING SHOT MOVES TO TOM GRUNICK

ta speaker, she seems a savior.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttWow.

<b>tEXT. CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
tAs they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously.
tJane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little
tadrift and temporarily free of obligations.  She is open to
tmaking a memorable mistake.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttAnother thing I can't stand --
ttIs this dull?

tTom shakes his head almost violently.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttNo, no, no, no...

tJane looks at him curiously -- then:

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(broadly)
ttAnother thing I can't stand is
tt...when White House reporters
ttbullshit with each other after
tta briefing and then one of them
tthas a theory and the other quotes
ttit in his story as "White House"
ttsources say...

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttThat actually goes on...

tA small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
tevidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized
tnotes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --
tTom, not far away in the room's only chair.  One lamp is on
tand it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
tenormously flattering light.  MUSIC comes from her miniature
tportable STEREO system.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttCome on...Even I'm not that
tthard on myself.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttNo, I really got this job on a
ttfluke and wait till you hear where
ttit ends up.

tJane smiles a calming smile.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttI was doing sports at the station.
ttThe newspaper ran this untrue story
ttthat I was leaving and they got all
ttthese tons of protest mail.  So they
ttmade me anchor.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttSo great -- right?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttExcept I'm no good at what I'm being
tta success at.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttHow are you at back rubs?

tJane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is
timmobilized by the sudden turn.  Jane waits, just a bit longer
tthan it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
texperiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.  She moves
tbriskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate
tfrom the pillow and munching it as she return to <u>his</u> agenda.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttIt's sort of normal -- the way you
ttfeel.  In graduate school everyone
ttthought the only mistake the

ttthem in.

tHe moves to the bed.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttListen to me.  You keep on thinking
ttI'm somebody ho lacks...confidence.
ttThat's not it.  I know I can talk well
ttenough and I'm not bad at making contact
ttwith people, but I don't like the 
ttfeeling that I'm pretending to be a 
ttreporter.
ttt(cont'd)
ttAnd half the time I don't really get 
ttthe news I'm talking about.  It isn't
ttthat I'm down on myself.  Trust me,
ttI stink.

</b>ttt(levelly)
ttI trust you.

</b>ttI didn't even have the chance to get

ttI thought I was starting to do
ttinteresting features but hockey is
ttbig at the station and...

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttWhat about the obvious remedy?
ttReversing things.  Maybe getting a
ttjob on a newspaper.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttI don't write.

tJane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttBut that didn't stop me from
ttsending out audition tapes to
ttbigger stations and the networks.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWell, come on -- it is your life.
ttNobody is tying you to the fast
tttrack.  Did you go to college?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttOne year...almost one year.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttSo, you're not well educated and
ttyou have almost no experience and
ttyou can't write.

tHe nods agreement.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttAnd I'm making a fortune.

tJane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with
ther hands... He's making her feel a little crazy.  She gets off
tthe bed.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttIt's hard for me to advise you
ttsince you personify something that
ttI truly think is dangerous.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(holding it in)
ttI agree with you -- you're not qualified.
ttt(letting it out)
ttSo get qualified.  You can insist on
ttbeing better prepared.  You don't have
ttto just leave it as...
ttt(mimicking him)
tt'I don't write.  I'm not schooled.
ttI don't understand the news I'm reading.
ttBut at least I'm upset about it, folks.'

tA beat, then he mumbles softly to himself.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttWhoa, this was a mistake.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttJust what do you want from me, anyway?
ttPermission to be a fake?  Stop whining
ttand do something about it.

tHe gets up to leave.  She follows him.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWell, you don't have to start right now.

tHe turns to her.

</b>ttSure.

</b>ttOkay.  I feel like I'm slipping but
ttdo people who are actually slipping
ttfeel that way or is it always the
ttreally good people who are moving up

ttGood night.

t-- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man,
ta good guy.  Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network
tthereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he

</b>ttTo be honest, I was best at anchor.

tErnie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?

<b>tEDITING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tTwo small TV monitors -- a smallish room.  Jane goes over her
ttiming notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the
tmonitors.  BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing
tJane's bidding.  On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece
twhich Jane is editing against a tightening deadline.  The
tPHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations
twhich continuing to edit.  The pressure is palpable to begin
twith but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting
tout of hand and threatening to bend lives.  Through it all, Jane
tremains remarkable calm.  Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.

ttGo back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound

</b>ttWe could...

</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttPlease, Bobbie, we're pushing.

tAs Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in
tthe glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room --
tJane's eyes click to him briefly.  She makes not a move to
twelcome him.  He pauses, but is committed and tries to find
ta piece for himself against the wall.

ttLet me hear it!

tThrough much of this chaos we focus on:

tto cover his first story.  He laughs out loud, loving his lot.

<b>tEXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - LATER AFTERNOON

tJane in the f.g. with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish
tto the GUERRILLA LEADERS.

ttttAARON (in Spanish)
ttAre you guys kidding or do you really
ttthink you'll run into something...?
ttI mean, do you feel that every time
ttand it never happens?  Or is it the
ttfirst time it felt that way and it's
ttgoing to happen?... I mean, how bad
ttcan it be?... Are you nervous...?
ttWhat's the chances on a scale of one

tta war within the next few hours?...
ttReally?

tHe starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was
ttalking with calling after him with an added thought.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttThanks, you speak English very well

ttGreat news.  He says they've been
ttengaging the Sandinistas pretty
ttregularly and that he'd be really
ttsurprised if we didn't take fire 
tttonight.

tJane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration.  Aaron is amazed at her
tattitude.

</b>ttLook at her.
ttt(to Jane)
ttIf anything happens to me tell every
ttwoman I've ever dated I was talking
ttabout them at the end.  That way they'll

tJane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention.
tAaron repeats his speech in Spanish.  The Guerrillas laugh.

tThe head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men.  Aaron
tgrabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left.  As they run --
tmore SHOTS.  Jane in work mode.  As soon as they settle.

tAs they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of
tthe nearly gunfire.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttThe first shots were fired not thirty

ttmust be outnumbered this is so small
tta unit:  that's a given.  Still they
tthold their ground despite the fact
ttthat their weapons have been acting
ttup -- misfiring or jamming.  A new

</b>ttI had a lot of questions here.  I

</b>ttAre you all packed and ready?

<b>ttttCAMERAMAN
</b>ttThe stuff in the dark is not good.
ttNobody wants news lit like that.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWill you just get packed?

tShe waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding
ta knapsack in her hand.  She takes off a brush and runs it
tthrough her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel
ttoothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
tfrom her canteen.  She puts everything back in place, then looks
tabout, sobs for several beats.  One of the Guerrillas hears her
tsobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance
taway.  Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of
texplanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.

</b>tt'Cause for the interview they're

</b>ttSure.

tThe Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image
tcomes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor.  He's not
thappy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction --
tgasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it.  Aaron enters.
tTom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
tBut again he almost manages to conceal his private rush.  Buddy's
tinternal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up,
tfearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
tthoughts.

tAaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.

tJennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied
tby the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle
tand scratches his back in friendship... Tom approaches an she
tmoves off -- not wanting to deal with him.  She takes a few
tbreaths as she keeps walking.  We HEAR snatches of PARTY
tCONVERSATIONS, i.e:

</b>ttTell me one person who ever left

</b>ttYou okay?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttYes.  Just don't say anything mean
ttfor a while.  Thanks.

tdown the steps and crosses to Tom.

tAaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then
tAaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters
tand huddles briefly with Paul... The News President is intent...
tThe two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer.  We PICK UP just
ta few words:

</b>ttThis would be a good time to tap

tthave an angle or something.

<b>tAARON'S P.O.V.
</b>

tlooking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes... Paul and Ernie
tnow move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new

tthem.

</b>ttt(to Jane)
ttWe want you to exec produce a

tJane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the
tbig boss.

</b>
tAs she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually
tcatching up with Paul.  In the b.g. Tom has just HEARD the

</b>ttHello, Buddy.  It's 1:35 -- and
ttthis is Tom.  You can reach me

tintensity.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttTom isn't ready for the job
ttyou're about to hand him.  Not

ttin Tripoli, he's interviewed
ttGaddafi -- he reported on the
ttEight-one story.  I think he's

ttWe'd better get moving.

ttowards the door.

</b>ttWatch? --

</b>ttI'll come by your place, right

</b>ttYeah, love you, too.

tthe truth.

<b>tINT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tIn the b.g. we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with
tactivity.  Tom closes the door.  He sits down behind his desk
tand opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there.
tHe opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside.  He picks
tone.  He reaches for a package of new red suspenders.  He takes
toff the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
tof an expert craftsman.  By the time he finishes he looks like
tthe authority figure we know he's now.

<b>tINT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR
</b>
tJane is NOT hyper.  She is purposeful -- organized -- even
tcalming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
tthe arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttTell George and Jessica to try
ttand cover everything without
ttTom having to ask additional
ttquestions.

<b>ttttBLAIR
</b>ttAnd Bobbie says...

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttDid you hear what I just said --
ttdo you have that?  Take a breath.

<b>ttttBLAIR
</b>ttt(a breath, then)
ttYes.

tIn the b.g. Tom has exited his office and looks about --
twaiting for some indication as to what to do next.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttAnd the most important thing
ttmake sure his earpiece works,
tthave back-ups ready.  That's
ttnever been more vital.  He
ttmust be able to hear me at

tJane sees him.  She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the
tarm.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWe have twenty minutes -- you can
ttwait in the studio.

tTom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a
tnearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off.

tMirage Fighter.

</b>ttI can't draw -- but this is a

tShe uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline
tan American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane.  Her work is
tstunning.

tHe has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a
tbottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.  He picks
ta French song -- looks at some of his books.  He might even
tread.  He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one.
tHe SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French.

</b>ttIs everything all right?

</b>ttYes.  You didn't have to come here.

tttold me -- 'Don't be afraid to be

tHe leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on
tthe cheek.  Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet
this immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.

tthe DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the
ttwo news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the
twall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
ttable occupied by Blair.  Now she slips into the large well
tpaddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.

tLiterally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
timmediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State
tand the White House.  In front of her the bank of monitors, the
tTechnical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at

<b>tANGLE FAVORING BLAIR
</b>
tAs she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus
tof minds and machines comprising the big time network news.
tAnd Jane Craig is at the helm.  Blair experiences a flash of

</b>ttt(sotto to Jane)

ta choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a

tsay, "This is a Special Report from..."

tAnnouncer's last words clear.

</b>ttGood afternoon.  A Libyan fighter

tAs she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume, she
tis over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping.

</b>ttWe only have ten minutes left --
tthow can you talk to me about parking
ttproblems?  No, not you'll try...you'll
ttdo it -- do it or I'll fry your fat

ttIn other words, I think we're okay.

<b>tINT. STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER
</b>
tMOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE,
tTAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages,
teven as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees
tthe subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a
tassistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him,
tbeginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN
tTOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN
tTO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells
thim roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>tt...So, Commander, it must have been
tta bit tougher today -- shooting down
ttthe French-made Mirage Jet.  The one
ttyou got was a SU-22...etc...

tAnd NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHOR'S EARS, the ear piece
tand the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond... almost an abstract
tvision.

<b>tINT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>ttttTOM'S VOICE
</b>tt...Once again:  The Libyan Government
tthas disavowed any prior knowledge of
ttthe flight.  This has been Tom Grunick
ttreporting from Washington.

tThe special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and
tBlair momentarily grasp hands.  The first talk concerns Tom.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttHe was brilliant.  I've never been
ttas proud of one of my decisions.

<b>ttttERNIE
</b>ttt(calls back to Jane)
ttGreat work, Jane, really -- You know?
ttReally.

tShe nods... totally depleted.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWell, there were no major gaffs anyway.

tErnie scoffs in her direction.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttThanks, everybody.

tShe exits the scene.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttt(to the Usher brothers)
ttThis was important for Tom -- there's
ttthat bonding thing that happens with
ttthe public and an anchorman during a
ttcrisis.  It's not the conventions
ttanymore; it's this kind of moment.

tTom enters.  He is exuberant.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttt(to Tom)
ttWhat a baptismal.  Congratulations.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttThanks.  With all the help you get,
ttit's sure easier than local.

tPaul and Ernie exchange a glance.

ttttTOM (cont'd)
ttWhere's Jane?  I'm still juiced.

tErnie points off... as Tom exits.  The Usher brothers hover.

</b>ttt(to the Usher brothers)
ttCan I help you?

<b>ttttMARVIN
</b>ttWe're here to play the new news theme.

<b>ttttERNIE
</b>ttNew theme?  You don't need me for this.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttStay.  Why should I be the only one
ttto feel silly?

<b>ttttMAN ONE
</b>ttWe need a synthesizer -- but this
ttwill give you an idea.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttGo ahead.
ttt(to Ernie)
ttWasn't he great?

<b>ttttERNIE
</b>ttIt worked.

tMan Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
tnews theme:  a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering
tcomposition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
tthat the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard.

<b>tINT. NEWSROOM - DAY
</b>
tAs Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in... He
tenters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win"
tthe most noteworthy moment of his working life.

</b>
<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttYou're an amazing woman.  What a feeling
tthaving you inside my head.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(a bit thrown)
ttYeah.  It was an unusual place to be.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttIndescribable -- you knew just when to 
ttfeed me the next thing, just a split 
ttsecond before I needed it.  There was a 
ttrhythm we got into, like great sex.

tJane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of
ttruthfulness.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttYou have to celebrate with me, don't
ttyou?  Everybody's going to that bar
tton the corner, 'Caps.'

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttI'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll
tthoop up with all of you later.  How
ttlong do you think you'll be there?

tTom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer.  They
tenters the elevator.

<b>tEXT. NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
tAs several people cross the street towards the bar.  Tom has
tbeen holding back on one question.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttIt's tempting to ask you how you think
ttI did.
ttt(she starts to reply)
ttNo.  I'm enjoying myself.  Take it easy.

tHe starts across the street.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(trying to be casual)
ttMaybe I'll see you over there.

tIndicates Bar.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttYou'll never show up.

tHe starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttJane?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttI'll wait for you till seven.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(shouting back)
ttOkay.

tTom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
tpauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction.  Jane
tmoving quickly along.

tSOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues
tthrough:

<b>tEXT. AARON'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING
</b>
tAs Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
tstoop outside.

<b>tON AARON
</b>
tHappy to see her, rising fairly soberly to his feet.  He APPLAUDS
tas she comes toward him.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttReally?  It was good.

tHe nods and APPLAUDS some more.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttYour calling in that information --
ttyou're the classiest guy I know.

tHe waves her off... And sits down on the stoop.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttIt was strange to watch him.  What's
ttthe next step?  Lip synching?

tShe sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttI've been doing some of the most
ttimportant thinking of my life.  I
ttwonder if this is the right time to
tttell you about it.

tShe steals a glance at her watch.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWell, whatever you think.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttI figured out exactly why it is I'm so
tthung up on getting a chance at weekend
ttanchor...It's because if I do that well,
ttthey'll pay me more, treat me great and
ttmy life will be better.  That's why.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttSounds like you may be on to something.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttWhich means I'm at their mercy and who
ttwants that?...I'm not going to tell
ttyou where this thought led me...
ttAnyway, well, why not  tell you? --
ttit's a happy thing.  In the middle of
ttall this I start to think about something
ttthat does nothing but make me feel good
ttand makes immediate sense and that's you
tt...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give
ttanything if you were two people so I could
ttcall up the one who's my friend and tell
tther about the one I'm in I...I don't think
ttI should go any further.  Come on --
ttI'll walk you to the corner.

tHe tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttYou know you've had a strange day...
ttI'd sleep on all these things you've
ttbeen thinking.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttAbsolutely...You go have a good time...
ttYou have some place to go?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttGood.

tHe grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his
thands and kisses her full on the lips.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttWell, I felt something.

tHe leaves her on the corner and walks back.

<b>tON JANE
</b>
tAs the SOUND OF NEWS THEME VOCALIZING PICKS UP ONE MORE...
tJane moving quickly, hailing a cab.

<b>tINT. CAB - EVENING
</b>
<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWe're going to Caps Bar at
ttSeventeenth and Vermont;
ttConnecticut is clear on Sunday...
tttake that over to Fifteenth, then
ttaround Vermont and we'll bypass
ttthe circle that way...if you don't
ttgo over forty we should catch mostly
ttgreen lights.

tON the DRIVER'S annoyed look.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttCome on -- don't take it the
ttwrong way.  I just know about
ttthings.

tHe hits the meter.

<b>tEXT. CAPS BAR - EVENING
</b>
tAs the cab pulls up, Jane gets out and pays him.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttGreat route.  I never made
ttanywhere near that fast before.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttThanks -- good driving --

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttThanks.  Coming from you I
ttappreciate it.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttThanks.

tAs she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer exit.
tAs they confront each other:

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttI didn't think you'd make it.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWell, I thought I'd check if all
ttof you were still here.  I'll just
ttgo in and join the gang and you
tttwo go on.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttThere's no gang in there -- We
ttwere the last ones.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWell, I'll go in and have a bite.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(to Jennifer)
ttJennifer, you want to have another
ttdrink?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttHey, I know how to have a burger by
ttmyself.  I feel like a little solitude.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(as they move off)
ttI sure know that feeling.  Terrific
ttwork today.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(too jock-like)
ttRight back to you.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttThanks for getting me through.

tHe puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
tcamaraderie.  She awkwardly disengages... waves and steps
tinside the door to the restaurant... standing there between
tthe two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away.

<b>tON TOM AND JENNIFER
</b>
tAs they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection
tover Jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a
tlook, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.

<b>tINT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT
</b>
tAs Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace, shedding
tclothes even as they enter.

<b>tINT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT
</b>
tWe are aware of MOVING FORMS.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(intense shout)
ttDamn all you sons-of-bitches.  Oh
ttshit, you bastards...

tThey finish.  A beat, then:

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttSorry.

<b>tON TOM AND JENNIFER
</b>
tTom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made
tlove to.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttNo, it's okay...People say different
ttthings.  They do...the plural threw
ttme.

tShe laughs.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttThe last time I was with someone we
ttwent through this awful mutual disease
ttquestionnaire but I guess it beats
ttgetting paranoid the next day.  Okay,
ttI'll go first.  I haven't...

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(stopping her)
ttIt would never occur to me to worry
ttat all about you.

tJennifer is touched...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttYou know something?  I'm deeply
ttcomplimented.   Isn't it strange to
ttbe deeply complimented because the
ttman you're with doesn't think you
tthave a venereal disease?...

tTom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed
tone outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty
tsort of motion punctuated by her comment:

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttGive me some of that.

tHe dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid
tgrin on his face.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttWhere's the bathroom?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttThrough the closet.

tHe opens the door and turns on the light in the closet.

<b>tINT. CLOSET - NIGHT
</b>
tIt is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and
tshoes extraordinarily well organized.  Tom stands there agape.
tVarious rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of
tluggage.

tShe joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of
ther.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttI converted a bedroom -- this
ttstuff builds up.  Wait till
ttyou've been doing this sixteen
ttyears.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttI'm not knocking it.  It's a
ttgreat solution.  Not only the
ttstorage but you can see everything
ttyou have.

tJennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in
tsilhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttDo you do bunny rabbits?

tTom is enjoying himself immensely.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttIsn't this a great date?

tWe HEAR the SOUND OF SCRATCHING as we:

<b>tINT. JANE'S EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING
</b>
tJane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone
tand SCRATCHING her arm.  She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF
tSTATESMEN move across the small screen.  She sighs and, without
trealizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet
tto recognize in herself.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(to herself)
ttGod help me.

tPeople have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttJesus, Jane.  How long have you
ttbeen here?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttA long time.  I was restless.
ttWill you crack my neck?

tHe starts massaging her neck as the phone rings.  she lets it
tring for a beat as Aaron works on her.  As she picks up the
treceiver we HEAR a CRACK.  She reacts to it at the same time
tshe utters a greeting.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttAaah --
ttt(into phone)
tt-- ello.  You sure they said the
ttmanagement meeting?
ttt(hangs up; then
ttt to Aaron)
ttThey want me to be at the
ttmanagement meeting.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttThey're not that dumb, after all.

tHe pats her on the back.

ttin network news history to produce?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(though distracted)
ttNo, I'm not.  I'm the fourth.
ttJoan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks
ttgot that credit once on a U.N.
ttspecial and there's Susan Zirinsky.

<b>tINT. MANAGEMENT MEETING - DAY
</b>
tPaul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk.
tTWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance.  As Paul
tdiscusses the more pressing problems of the network news
tdivision, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by
ther first moment at the seat of power.  She has the blues.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttAnyway, they seem to be very serious
ttabout making me out eight million from
ttthe budget and that means massive firings.
ttI'm doing everything I can... It's too
ttearly to make up a 'death list' but I
ttjust wanted you to be aware of the
ttsituation... We're also going to cover
ttthe Alaskan serial killer trial on a
ttcontinuing basis.  I'd like it done out
ttof Washington which means we've got to
ttget somebody on a plane for Anchorage.
ttWe can't fool around anymore...Jane...

tShe looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed.

ttttPAUL (cont'd)
ttThis is going to be high-profile on
ttthe Evening News -- who do you think?
ttGeorge Weln or Jennifer?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(much, much too quickly)
ttJennifer.

tThe men look at her curiously.  She repeats herself more
trationally.

ttttJANE (cont'd)
ttJennifer.

<b>tINT. TOM'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
tHe has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane
tappears in his doorway.  For the first time, we notice that
tshe is woefully ba at at least one endeavor -- flirting.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttCome on, I'll buy you a drink.
ttThere's a big thing over at the
ttItalian embassy.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttI'm not sure I'd be good

ttI'll be the judge of that.

<b>tINT. ITALIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT
</b>
tAs they walk in -- one MAN looks at Tom with a glint of
trecognition.  Then another -- a handshake -- A WOMAN introduces
therself.  A small knot of people form.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttIt's much too soon for you to have
ttthis kind of buzz around you.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttDo I have to stand here in the middle
ttand meet them all?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttI'll get you through.  Move and smile.
ttt(she pushes him
ttt a little)
ttAnd smile and move...

</b>ttIs it safe for me to fly home?

</b>ttYes.  We're fine now.

<b>tON AARON
</b>
tAnd now he sees that it's Tom.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttIs God testing me or something?

<b>ttttMARTIN KLEIN
</b>ttPaul loves him.  I heard him give
tthim the most poetic compliment in
tthis command.  'He's hot.'  Sometimes
ttgroups of executives get together just
ttto say that work back and forth...'He's
tthot, oh, she's hot.  Oh, he's really
tthot.'  Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot...

ttAnd here we are.

<b>ttttMARTIN KLEIN
</b>ttt(sudden thought)
ttMaybe Jane would like my food idea as

tHe moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her... Tom is
tstranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttHi, Aaron...What's doing?

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttSame old stuff.  I'm watching a man
ttwho won three Overseas Press Awards
ttpitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

tA MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand:

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttYou want to go out there --
ttt(indicating balcony)
ttget out of this for a second?

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttWhy don't you lead?  I'll just

tTom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttWhat did I do to you?

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttYou've made my dreams silly.

tTom decides not to deal with the remark.  He's jolted by the
thostility.  He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor
tterrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men
tstare at the party.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(gesturing at the

tAaron nods.

tThey look inside.

<b>ttttAARON

</b>ttt(warming)
ttGreat.  Network news, Washington...

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttKeep it to yourself.

</b>ttYou know the other day I really wanted

</b>ttOh, stop it.

tOn Tom's reaction.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttYou can't talk about feeling
ttintimidated when you're on top of

</b>ttI'm not buying into any of that.  I

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttt(finishing for him)
ttYou have the job you have...

tThe sudden debate is important to Tom -- but it's moving too

</b>ttShut up a second...

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttt(amiably)
ttOkay.  Pretty petty party, isn't
ttit, pal?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(picking his words)
ttI made one rule for myself when this

</b>ttCan you name all the members of the

<b>ttttTOM

tfull of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a

</b>ttI'll see you two inside -- I think
ttwe're all at the same table.
ttt(sotto to Jane)
ttYou're finally learning to be flexible.
ttGlad you changed your mind about Tom.

tHe passes through the detector... Tom starts to step through it --
tshe pulls him back.

</b>ttI'm sorry.  I don't want to go in
ttthere and sit with everybody.
ttt(imagining it)
ttI can't...why don't you go?

tHe considers this option as she waits.

</b>ttSuppose I go in for a little while and
ttyou wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?

</b>ttGood.  That's it...See you.

</b>ttYou're not going to take off on

tWatching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing

tpast one other man until he is standing directly behind her.

</b>ttI just want you to know that my

ttputs tremendous pressure on you.

tJane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life
tthreatens to be good.  And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of
tthe escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered
thand.  As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.

ton his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of

tHe dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow --

tthelpful and he will get a job where
tthe influences a great God-fearing
ttnation and he will never do an evil

tHe kisses her lightly -- looking at her... Then heartfelt:

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttOh, honey.

tHe walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his
tpaper bags of bathing suits.  The bus pulls away.

<b>tON JANE
</b>
tWatching him go.

<b>tJANE'S P.O.V.
</b>
tTom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very
tmuch as he is when on television.

<b>tINT. AIRPORT TAXICAB - DAY
</b>
tJane gets quickly into cab.

<b>ttttCABBIE
</b>ttGood morning.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttGood morning.
ttt(after collecting herself)
ttDupont Circle, please.

tThe cab pulls away.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttDon't take the beltway, because at this
tttime of day there's gonna be a lot...
ttt(stops herself, then)
tt...Go any way you want.

tShe sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and 
tquietly adding what she knows to be true:

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttBut New York Avenue's faster.

<b>tttttttFADE OUT:
</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY
</b>
tMuch the same place where Jane and Tom first met.  The
twords "SEVEN YEAS LATER" appears on the screen.

tA sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the
tLocal Television Broadcasters... and that at 2 P.M.  Tom Grunick
twill be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism
tfor the '90s."

<b>tINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
tMuch the same audience, though two members of the audience
tmay strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen
tfrom behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old.
tTom is in mid-speech.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>tt... when they told me Bill had decided
ttto retire and offered me the Evening
ttNews, I thought it was the same kind
ttof joke we used to pull back at the
ttstation -- turning off somebody's
ttprompter in the middle of a show.

tSome good-natured laughter.

ttttTOM (cont'd)
ttAnd then when they heard my reaction --
ttthey thought I was kidding.  I told them
ttI'd be their anchor but I didn't want
ttto be the Managing Editor -- that there
ttwere people better qualified than I to 
ttcontrol the content and if there 
ttweren't we were all in trouble.

tThe audience really enjoys this:

<b>tSAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER
</b>
<b>tMOVING SHOT...
</b>
tThe anchor teams -- leaning forward.  They love this man,
ta humble specialist refusing the generalist trap.  Imagine
tthe feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man
tnot unlike yourself.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttAnd now to something more
ttimportant... I'd like to introduce
ttmy bride.
ttt(gestures to a woman in
ttt the front row)
ttLila?

tA svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.

<b>tON CURLY HAIRED MAN AND BOY...
</b>
tAaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs. Grunick.

<b>tINT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tTom and Lila shaking hand.  Aaron, his son in his arms, wait.

<b>tON TOM
</b>
tAs he sees Aaron... he is clearly delighted.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttHoly shit, Aaron.

tHe claps him on the back... Aaron is as pleased as he is
tuncomfortable with the attention.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttLila -- this is Aaron Altman.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(high British accent)
ttOh, yes -- you're one of Tom's
tt50 or so role models.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttHi.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttWell, this kid couldn't possibly
ttbelong to anyone else.  What's
ttyour name?

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttClifford...

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttt(indicating Tom)
ttDo you know who this is, Cliff?

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttThe big joke?

tTom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttI'm just bringing him over to give
ttJane a look at him --

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttI thought she'd be here.  I'll
ttgo with you.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttOkay.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(to Lila)
ttI'll see you back at the hotel.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttt(cool)
ttAll right.

tHe starts off.  She pulls him back for an urgent communication.

<b>ttttLILA
</b>ttTom, the speech was magnificent.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttOh, I didn't say anything about
ttyour speech.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttI appreciate it.

<b>tINT. WALKWAY - DAY
</b>
tTom, Aaron and the boy walking along.  Tom plays with Cliff
tas they move.  The boy is delighted.  Jane is in a park -- a
tblanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she
thas some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.

tShe HEARS her name being called.

<b>tON JANE
</b>
tShielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom.  As 
tthey reach her.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(to herself)
ttWell, why not?
ttt(as they arrive)
ttHey, what is this?  My life's
ttrushing in front of my eyes.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttA picnic?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttI thought for ol' Cliff here --
ttLook at you?  You're more adorable
ttthan your pictures.  Look what I
ttgot for you.

tShe hands him a toy.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttWhat do you say, Cliff?

tThe boy kisses Jane's hand.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttHe excels at gratitude.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(to Jane)
ttAre you any closer to a decision?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttI think so...They've been talking
ttto me about being Tom's Managing
ttEditor.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttReally?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttt(to Tom)
ttI'm going to take it.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttWhat a great surprise.  I didn't
ttthink we had a chance.  I heard
ttyou wanted to stay in Washington.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWell, there's a guy, but he says he'll
ttfly up a lot.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttWell, we should talk.  You going to
tthave time for  dinner?  I'd like
ttyou to meet Lila.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttI'm sorry because I was looking
ttforward to that, but I' m going
ttback in a few hours.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttOkay...It's so good to see you.

tShe gives him a quick kiss.  He shakes hands with Aaron.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(to Aaron)
ttIt's nice to see you.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttCongratulations on history's longest
ttwinning streak.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttIf you ever get restless in Portland,
ttlet me know.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttWhy?

tTom shuffles uncomfortably.

<b>tON JANE
</b>
tSmiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the
tpowerful.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(to Jane as he leaves)
ttBye...boss.

tTom walks away.  He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up
tto see his son running after Tom.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttt(calling)
ttHey!  Cliff!  Cliff!

tTom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(to Clifford)
ttGo back to your daddy.

tThe boy starts back.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttCome on, Cliff.  Come on.

tAs Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttt(to Jane)
ttSo who's the guy?

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttWell, we met about three months ago.
ttHe works at the surgeon general office.
ttHe loves boating.  So, he's been 
ttgetting me into water skiing.

tAaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure.
tJane deliberately moves past this moment.

<b>ttttJANE
</b>ttI like it!  So, doll, what about you
ttlately?

<b>ttttAARON
</b>ttWell -- my wife got this new job...

tHe continues to talk.  As the two former colleagues catch up,
ttheir ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and
tthe scene slowly recedes into a black b.g. and we...

<b>tttttttFADE OUT.
