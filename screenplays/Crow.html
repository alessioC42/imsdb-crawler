 tThe CROW

tby

tDavis Schow

tbased on a screenplay by
tJohn Shirley

tBased on the comic book
tcreated, drawn, and written by
tJames O'Barr

tSeptember 14, 1992

<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
tBOOM!  A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a
tperched crow large in the f.g.

<b>tTIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE
</b>
tAs a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.

<b>ttttDIMITRI (O.S.)
</b>ttWe're losing the light; let's pack
ttit in.

<b>tANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI
</b>
tTWO GRAVEDIGGERS.  Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic-
tstyle church b.g.  Rolls of astro turf.  They look up toward 
tthe sky.

<b>ttttALEXI
</b>ttSnow, maybe?

<b>ttttDIMITRI
</b>ttWhat, you gonna ski on this?

tHe indicates the mound of fresh dirt.  Spits into the grave.

<b>ttttDIMITRI (CONT'D)
</b>ttCome on, let's bag this.  It's
ttbeer time.

tAlexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt.

<b>tLOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES
</b>
tAs we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the 
twearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in 
tsequence.

<b>tTIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW
</b>
tCemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows
tthe arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers
tas it begins to sprinkle rain.

<b>tANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION
</b>
tA dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-
toffs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She
ttotes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
tPollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
tday-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may
tunzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She 
tstops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttGuess the picnic got rained out.

tShe looks down o.s. at --

<b>tANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE
</b>
tas Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent.

<b>tRESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G.
</b>
tas Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
tnear Shelly Webster's.

<b>tANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES
</b>
tTILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the 
tgranite, darkening it.

tEXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE

tIt blinks in its alien way.

<b>tWITH THE CROW
</b>
tas it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
theadstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

<b>tANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE
</b>
tShe hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttOh, scary.

tThe bird blinks at her from the headstone.
<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttWhat are you, like, the night
ttwatchman?

tAnother blink from El Birdo.

<b>tCAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH
</b>
tas she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
tback.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
talleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
tcontinue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
tthe middle of the city.

<b>tEXT. MAXI-DOGS - TWILIGHT - RAIN CONTINUES
</b>
tCLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.

<b>ttttMICKEY (O.S.)
</b>ttWhat this place needs is a good
ttnatural catastrophe.  Earthquake,
tttornado...

<b>tANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY
</b>
tALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.

tMICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
topen-front fast foodery.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttYou gotta put the mustard
ttunderneath first.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttMaybe a flood, like in the Bible.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttHere, let me do it.

tHe grabs the dog from Mickey.  Mickey puffs his cigar while he
tcooks.  Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
tsurgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
tthe dog in the bun.  Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look. 

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttCome on... onion.  Don't cheap
ttout on me.  Lotta onions.

<b>tMOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS
</b>
<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttHeyyy -- it's the Elly monster.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttHow do you ride that thing on a 
ttwet street?

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttTalent. Hi.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttCare for a hot dog?

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttYou buying?

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttI'm buying.

tElly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.  They`ve done this routine before.

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttNo onions though, okay?

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttt(horror)
ttNo onions?

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttThey make you fart.

tMickey laughs.  Spots Elly a Coke.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttWhat's goin' on, Elly?

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttI went to see a friend of mine.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttWell, how's your friend?

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttShe's still dead.

tAlbrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:  Elly's matter-of-
tfactness.

<b>tEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (RAIN)
</b>
tThunder KABOOMS o.s.  The crow pecks the top of the stone again
tand a chip of granite flies off, bang!

<b>tEXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE
</b>
tas the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.

<b>tCLOSE-UP - THE CROW
</b>
tA dot of blood on its ebony beak.

<b>tLOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE
</b>
tA thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
tstone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
tplays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.

<b>tRESUME THE CROW
</b>
tas it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.

<b>tCLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD
</b>
tIt slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.

<b>tCLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER
</b>
tA LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
twe see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.

<b>tMEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER
</b>
tas lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a 
tlong duster and a cowboy hat.

<b>tRESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE
</b>
tDRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.

<b>tNEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER
</b>
tTurning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched 
tarm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
tbeneath the brim of the cowboy hat.

<b>tRESUME ERIC'S GRAVE
</b>
tas blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.

<b>tTIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW
</b>
tshaking off rain.  Watching intently.

<b>tCLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND
</b>
tBlack gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
tknuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.

<b>tRESUME ERIC'S GRAVE
</b>
tThe turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
tparts the earth to grasp the rose.

tSKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE

tas the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
theadstone.

<b>tLOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC
</b>
tPale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in 
tback.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
tfrom his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC
</b>
tas he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.

tERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY

twater-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
ton his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
tto the tree.

<b>tANGLE -  ERIC
</b>
tWatching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
tThe crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
tlooks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttWhat the hell are you?

<b>ttttSKULL COWBOY
</b>ttInterested?  Follow the crow.

tNB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
tcharnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.

tEric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
teyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the 
tSkull Cowboy is gone.

<b>tLOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW
</b>
tTaking wing in the rain, showing the way.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC
</b>
talone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
toff, following the crow.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH:
</b>
tA candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.

<b>tINT. ARCADE GAMES SUPPLY OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tA MOVING SHOT during o.s. lines.  Past dead video and pinball
tdevices.  Pasta desk with an open briefcase, coffee cup,
tashtray -- someone was just there.  Then past a WOMAN, trussed
twith duct tape to her office chair, gagged, hot fear in her 
tdarting eyes.

tCOMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak 
twith pattern baldness, always loud, jittery, a manic dust puppy.
tAnd T-BIRD, an arrogant Arayan, brush-cut iron pumper, who is
tprepping an incendiary.  He exhibits a small squeeze bottle of
tarson cocktail to Skank.

<b>ttttT-BIRD
</b>ttUncle T-Bird's 100-proof
ttaccelerator.  I squirt you with
ttthis, you could jump in the 
ttDetroit river and burn all the way
ttto the bottom.

tINSERT A CLOSE-UP of the bomb in his hands as he works.  Silver
tcanisters, an LED timer, wires.

<b>ttttT-BIRD (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou know, Lake Erie actually
ttcaught on fire once, from all the
ttcrap in it.  Wish I coulda seen
ttthat.

tHe CLICKS a switch.  PEEP.  LED countdown blurs.

<b>ttttT-BIRD (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe're ready to rock.

tSkank notices the captive woman's handbag on the floor.  Picks
tit up.  Looks through it for valuables.

<b>ttttSKANK
</b>ttWhat about working girl?

tINTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.

<b>ttttT-BIRD
</b>ttWhat about her?

<b>ttttSKANK
</b>ttI say we leave her here to fry,
ttman.

tT-Bird looks casually at the woman.  Smiles hideously.

<b>ttttT-BIRD
</b>ttNo.  Let's take her with us.

<b>tANGLE - THE WOMAN
</b>
tHer eyes bug in a terrified NO!

<b>tEXT. STREET - MOVING - NIGHT
</b>
tAs the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.

<b>tINT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING - NIGHT
</b>
tTB drives.  One eye on his digital watch (doing an equally
tfast countdown).  Skank wrestles their captive, the woman, in
tthe back seat.

<b>ttttTB
</b>ttt(pissed off)
ttSkank, shut her the fuck up!

tSKank punches her and she sags.  Then he looks forward.

<b>ttttSKANK
</b>ttWhoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red
ttlight!

<b>tEXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT
</b>
tAs the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
tnightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.

<b>tANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS
</b>
tReacting, with a mouthful.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttGoddammit.

tMickey grabs the counter phone instantly.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttCall it in?

tAlbrecht is off and running for the corner already.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttYeah, do it!
ttt(to Elly)
ttStay right there!

tHOLD ON MICKEY.  He points at Albrecht's hot dog.  Yecch.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(yelling after)
ttYou want I should save this for
ttyou?

<b>tEXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT
</b>
tThe car slides to a nose-down panic stop.

<b>ttttSKANK (O.S.)
</b>ttDump her, man, dump her!

tThe woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
twar hoop from the guys inside.

<b>tANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT
</b>
tGun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing
tcar.  Gives it up.  Still too far away.  Pedestrians in the way.

<b>tANGLE - THE WOMAN
</b>
thurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape 
tstuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
tshe falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of

<b>tCLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN
</b>
tTheir eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.

tNB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
tof things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
tfragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
tmust assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and 
taccompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.

<b>tFLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE
</b>
tThe faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
thideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the 
tblade.  Blood.  Skank hits her, pow! and --

<b>ttttFLASH ENDS.
</b>
<b>tANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND WOMAN
</b>
tAn airborne crow POV spiralling up and away from them.

<b>tttttttMATCH WITH:
</b>
<b>tANGLE - THE CROW
</b>
tperched on a fire escape, high above, watching and waiting.

<b>tANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AND WOMAN
</b>
tShe fades.  He lets her drop away, horrified.  And staggers back
tinto the cover of the alley.  Her blood is on his hands.

<b>tANGLE - ALBRECHT RUNNING
</b>
tSkidding in, spotting the woman.  Kneeling to her.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttHere now!  You're gonna be okay!
ttCan you understand me?  I'm a
ttpolice officer...

tThe woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttHe touched me and it stopped.  The
ttpain.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttWhat did you say?

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttI saw a ghost...

tHer eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttOh no... don't go, darlin', you
ttstay with me, now... shit!

<b>tHIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY
</b>
tBOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police
tunits screech up to assist.

<b>tEXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT
</b>
tEric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against
tthe wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.

<b>tANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)
</b>
tCircling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.

<b>tBACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")
</b>
t"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually 
tdistinct and immediately identifiable.

<b>tERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES
</b>
tWhich he's already seen through the crow's eyes.

<b>tANGLE - ERIC
</b>
tlooking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
tSuddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
tfrom:

<b>tANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES
</b>
tThe rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
tdebris.

<b>tANGLE - WITH ERIC
</b>
the reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.

<b>tANGLE - THE CROW
</b>
tlanding on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
tboots in the trash.  Flames.

<b>tLOW ANGLE - ERIC
</b>
tThe blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
tshirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
twith his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --

<b>tPUSH IN ON ERIC
</b>
tas his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
tchest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
twounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
tHis glance at the bird is almost accusatory.

tANGLE - THe CROW

tInscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
tcommunication is taking place.

<b>tANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 
</b>
tbare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
tcrow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
this bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.
<b>tSIRENS
</b>
<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttFire.  In the rain.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT
</b>
tWe are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
tmusic is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band
trules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup
ttrendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
tthe BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
testablishment since we are --

<b>tTIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10
</b>
tThinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
tVisible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
tEric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
<b>tCROSS FRAME.
</b>
tGRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
tHis facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
tdown the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
t- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
tsupplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
tkillers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
tjust a minute.

tThey have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
tfingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
tclear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

tAs the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
tsuspiciously -- to Nwa.

<b>ttttNGO NWA
</b>ttHe will see me... unannounced.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR
</b>
tAs Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
ta word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
tGrange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
tside.

<b>tINT. LAO'S NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE.  Through a large window
t(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
tthrough automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
tmonitors is hot with surveillance.

tLAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
talmost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
tthe King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.

tAt the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
tperfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
tis bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
tmeter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
tbeneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

tNB:  The following exchange will play FAST, and entirely in
<b>tVIETNAMESE.
</b>
<b>ttttLAO
</b>tt(formal greeting)

<b>ttttNWA
</b>tt(dismissiveness, contempt, then
ttchastizing anger as:)

tNwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.

<b>ttttLAO
</b>tt(phony assuagement)

<b>ttttNWA
</b>tt(knows it's bullshit)

tLao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control.  Deep
tbreath.  He turns back to his "master."  Nwa gestures broadly at
tthe oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but 
tis somehow errant
<b>t 
</b><b>ttttNWA
</b>tt(respect is required)

<b>ttttLAO
</b>tt(begrudging agreement)

tLao sees the blade.  An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it
tthe Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
timmeasurable worth.

<b>ttttNGO NWA
</b>tt(why give me this?)

tNonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
tNwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
tsternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
tanything untoward.

<b>ttttLAO
</b>tt(sinister punchline)

tLao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
tchest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
tastonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely 
ttreacherous, he is extremely capable.

<b>ttttLAO
</b>ttt(in perfect English)
ttWhen I spoke of an offering, I
ttdidn't mean an offering to you.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
</b>
tGrange, standing out of arm's reach in the corridor, kills both
tBodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the
tdoor OPENS.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR - LAO, GRANGE, AND CORPSES
</b>
tLao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
taffirmatively.

<b>ttttGRANGE
</b>ttYou gonna smoke his bones now, or
tthowever it is you do it?

tLao smiles indulgently.  He wipes the blood from the blade on
tthe jacket of his ex-lord.  Lao now bows to no one. 

<b>tEXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ANOTHER ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
tEric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
tUp.  He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.  Ouch.

<b>tCLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM
</b>
tBlood flows from the gash.  He vises his fist shut.

<b>tANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE
</b>
tEye-to-eye with the crow.  Opens his hand.

<b>tCLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM
</b>
tThe blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself, 
tleaving another scar.

<b>tANGLE - ERIC
</b>
tVising the rail.  Speaks to the night.  Almost a mantra.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>tt"My kitten walks on velvet feet,
ttand makes no sound at all.  And in
ttthe doorway nightly sits to watch
ttthe darkness fall.  I think
tthe loves the lady night..."
ttt(to crow)
ttAm I alive?  Am I dead?  Something
ttelse?  Something in between?

<b>tCLOSE-UP - THE CROW
</b>
tInscrutable.  No answer here.

<b>tRESUME ERIC
</b>
tAlmost bemused.  Steadier.  A hint of friendliness.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttThanks for sharing that.

<b>tETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
tAs the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.  Menacing.

<b>tINT. GIDEON'S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
tA junkyard of loot and dusty discards.  Junkie thievings and
tother people's stereos.  Behind a wire-meshed security counter
tGIDEON reads a racing form, chain-smoking throughout the scene.  He
tis pear-shaped, stubbled, unkempt.  Food on his shirt.  JINGLE

tthe night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttAll right.

tAnd he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the
tfalls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
tstill moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
truns out of the frame.

tas he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
tTRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.

tHe jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next 
troof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
tWOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
tstrength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.

texecutes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.

</b>ttAnd you're gonna tell me who.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttWho ever made that.

tAlbrecht points.  CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.  A crow

tAs the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum

tSudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back
tagainst the frosted glass of the front door.

<b>ttttGIDEON (CONT'D)
</b><b>ttHEY!!
</b>
tAnd he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the

trocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and 
tknocking him flat on his ass.  He loses the pistol.
tEric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to
tdisintegrate around him.  He disclaims, thespian.

<b>ttttGIDEON
</b>ttOh, bullshit!  You're trespassing

tDuring Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his
tshoulders, nonplussed.  Now he flings Gideon across the room.

tGideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him:

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttI'm looking for something in an
ttengagement ring.  Gold.

tAs Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open
tcage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.

tAnd he tries to nail Eric with the knife.

ttI ain't got no fuckin' ring.

tEric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls!

</b>ttAll's I got is in a box!  Behind

tEric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees 
this own pierced hand, immobilized.

tKnives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box.

tDozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them.

tHe tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until:

tFLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision...

<b>tttttttFLASH ENDS.
</b>
<b>tRESUMING ERIC
</b>
tHe closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of
tdecision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter.
tUses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes
tspinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and
trams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttTin-Tin confided in me, before he
ttran out of breath.  You have one

</b>ttNo fucking way.  He'll kill me.

</b>ttYou want those assholes, you want

</b>ttA whole club of pirates, with

tEric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of
tflammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed
thand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering.

<b>tLOW ANGLE - ERIC
</b>
tLooking down at Gideon in revulsion.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttYou feed off the living.

tSMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then
tEric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him
tentirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire
ta white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches 
tfor it.

tthe fireball.

tinto the inferno.  Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
tfrom his own clothes.

</b>ttDon't move! I said don't move.

tEric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttI thought the police always said

tAlbrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
tEric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of

ttyou're dead.

tEric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.  Palms up.  A gesture of
tsubmission.  Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttAnd I say I'm dead... and I move.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttNo further.  I'm serious.

tEric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.

ttt(meaningfully)
ttAs Shelly Webster once needed your

ttgoing to need my assistance.

tAlbrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
tgun.  B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.

</b>ttYou wanna run that back for me one

tSIRENS near, o.s.  Eric listens to them, to the night.

tEric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.  Slow and easy.
tAlbrecht doesn't completely trust him.  Up comes the gun.

tEric slices open his palm.  Blood flows.  To his fingertips.

tadmits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired

tAs the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill,

</b>ttIt's a big fucking bird...

tShe falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing.

tExcept that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the

</b>ttHere Funboy.

tContained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle.  The needle

tmaintain against his high.

</b>ttOh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do

tto make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to
tFunboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttNeither.

<b>ttttFUNBOY
</b>ttYeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

tFunboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the
tgun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on

trelentlessly.

tlooms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it.

<b>ttttFUNBOY
</b>ttAhh, the hell with it, I still got
ttfive shots left.

tIn a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the 
tcrunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a
thole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed.

tEric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of

tinserted.

</b>ttI have some pain killer right here.

tAnd he fills the syringe all the way.

tas he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing

</b>ttNo, wait, no WAIT, that's too

</b>ttYour pain ends now.

tAnd Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home
tthe full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse.

tEric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in
tthe corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens
this eyes.

tThe Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.

</b>ttMaybe I was wrong about you.

tThe Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed.  All we get is
ta little shake of his skull-head.

tDarla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her.  She's really
tconfused.  She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.

</b>ttYour daughter is out there, on the

tShe's stunned, utterly speechless.  All she can do is look in
tEric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttGo.  Now.

tDarla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without 
ta glance back at Funboy.

tEric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door,
tstooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with 
tFunboy.  The Skull Cowboy has vanished.  PUSH IN.  Grimly, Eric
ttakes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.

tCLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
tweaponless.  He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
tand RUNNING along the precarious peak.

tLao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
tFLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.

tERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
troof.  Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
tThe steel RINGS.  Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
tthat DUMPS Lao.

tEric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.  Distantly, Lao
tsimilarly saves himself.

tNEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
tthe peak.  Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
trod and tries to wrest it loose.

tSIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
tblue-hot.

tMOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.  Lao
tcloses up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - 

tEric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
tThe weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
thandcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.

tANGLE  -- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC  as he dodges Lao by using the
tlightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
tthe roof.

tWith the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs 
ton to Eric.

tUP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
tthe sword.

<b>ttttLAO
</b>ttFace me!

tEric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
tWhen he looks up, Lao is gone.

tANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.  Looks
taround, finally spots Eric below and to the left.  YELLS, serio-comic.

<b>ttttALBRECHT
</b>ttIs he dead yet?

tINSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
tgun quickly.

tANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.

<b>ttttLAO
</b>ttNo.  You are.

tHe jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.

tCLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.  Shock.

tINSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
ttrailing sparks, snuffing out.

tANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
tnight above him.

tANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
<b>ttttLAO
</b>ttYou've caused another death,
ttMister Draven!  The girl will die
ttas well -- because of you!

<b>tANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS
</b>
tThe base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttYou go to hell, you pervert!

<b>tRESUME ERIC
</b>
tRage over the loss of Albrecht.  He RISES, hurting but mad as
thell.  GLARES UP toward Lao.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttAnd how many lives have you destroyed?

<b>ttttLAO
</b>ttI took yours from you.  Your
ttlittle girlfriend?  I took hers,
tttoo.  Your meaningless, petty
ttlife?  I took it so that tonight
ttyour existence might gain a
ttpurpose.  You're no avenger.
ttYou're mine.

<b>tPUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.
</b>
tEyes alight with hatred for Lao.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttt (to himself)
ttYou're right, I'm not an avenger. 
ttNot any more.

tAs lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.

<b>tHIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")
</b>
tSEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.

<b>tANGLE  - LAO ON ROOFTOP
</b>
tAs the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!

tCLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
tPecking out Lao's eyes.

tWITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
tclimb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.

tRESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.  Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
tdown the roof - toward Eric.
tSLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
tfisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.  Fury.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttTime for a sacrifice.

tLao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
teyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.

<b>ttttLAO
</b>ttI don't need eyes to take what I
ttwant from you.

tHe EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
tback!

tON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
tsternum.  Tight grimace.  A lot of pain.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttCan you fly?

tHe pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
<b>tTIGHT.
</b>
<b>tMOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL
</b>
tEric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
tINTO Lao.  Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
tthe killing blade still embedded in him!

tWITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
tposition.  Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.  Sees the
tblade in his own chest.

tCLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.

tRESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.  He PLUMMETS off the 
troof edge.

tANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly
tis in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own
tshaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.

tON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
tto get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttDon't let me fall!

tCLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.

<b>tEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)
</b>
tA low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).

tEric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, 
tlimping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal 
tthe flowers there.

tEric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttNow do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttIn a better place.  I hope.

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttYou're not gonna come back, are you?

tEric's response is halting and uncertain.  But he tries to give
ther hope.  He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
tit up to her.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttI don't know if I can.  But you
tthave this... and you know where to come.

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttYou mean you'll, like' dig your way
ttout of the grave?  Euww.

tEric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.

tHe grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
ther on the forehead.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttFor you, I'll try.  Promise.

<b>tMOVE WITH ERIC
</b>
tSpent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
tgoing to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.

tHis legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One
tgroping hand tries to drag him further.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttLeave me now.

<b>tANGLE - ELLY
</b>
tTears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops
tthe flowers on Shelly's grave.

<b>tERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE
</b>
tStill too far away to matter.

<b>tRESUME ERIC ON GROUND
</b>
tHe gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
tbefore SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.

tNo ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
tblank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.

<b>tANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG
</b>
tShe struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
twipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns
ttoward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.

<b>tANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE
</b>
tEric is gone.  The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
tundisturbed  earth there.

<b>tHIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY
</b>
tEmphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.

tLOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --

tShe walks OFF.  HOLD the rose.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. DARLA'S APARTMENT - DAY (OVERCAST)
</b>
tA grey day but no rain.  Elly stands wistfully by the window,
ther doll on standby.  The apartment is in order and perhaps we
tnotice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is
tsprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME
tB.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is
thectic but natural.

<b>ttttDARLA
</b>ttWorktime, kiddo.  First day, new
ttjob, gotta go.

tThis does not get the expected smile from Elly.

<b>ttttDARLA (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou sure you're gonna be okay?

tElly turns from the window and NODS silently.

<b>tELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE
</b>
tThe aforementioned grey day in the city.

<b>tANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.
</b>
tDarla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much
tmore connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is
tclutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past
tElly, out the window.

<b>ttttDARLA
</b>ttAt least it finally stopped
ttraining.

<b>ttttELLY
</b>ttIt can't rain all the time.

tDarla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS
ther hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --

<b>tANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE
</b>
tElly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is
tElly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.

<b>tEXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
tAn UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
tINTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the
tcrow.  Watching.  Waiting.

<b>tttttttSLOW FADE TO DEAD BLACK.
