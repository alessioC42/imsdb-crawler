</b>


<b>tFADE IN:
</b><b>tINT. PROFESSOR OCK"S PRIVATE PHYSICS LABORATORY, THE
</b><b>tCYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY
</b>
tA mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults our ears. A FLASHING RED
tWARNING LIGHT stabs our eyes.

tSeveral DIALS go into the RED. A hand pushes aside a
tYELLOW THERMOS and pushes forward a RED POWER THROTTLE.
tWe hear the WHINING UP of a cyclotron. A DIGITAL DIAL
tclimbs to "5% POWER." A SPIDER crawls across a DIAL.

tBegin OPENING CREDITS.

tTHE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling
tpaint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE. Leaks are here and
tthere. COBWEBS are all around.

tDOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange
tfeatured man in his mid-fifties.

tHis assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He's
topen mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. WEINER is
ta local, small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the
tschool administration and to "procure" whatever OCK needs
tfor his experiments. He shades his eyes against a searing
tBLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW. THE ROOM IS
<b>tDIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS.
</b>
<b>ttttWEINER
</b>ttWhoa, whoa, whoa... what's that?

tWith a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with
tshards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(rising)
ttWe begin again... let's kick in that new
tttransducer. See if we can double the
ttpower output.

<b>ttttWEINER
</b>ttt(rising more slowly)
ttWhoa, Doc... wait a minute...

tBut OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls
tup. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK
tlooks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL
tCHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, "eight, nine..."
tthe BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is
tshattering.

<b>tEND OPENING CREDITS.
</b>
<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttOkey... dokey!

tThe POWER DIAL hits ten.

<b>tEXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY
</b>
tAs STUDENTS go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills
tout of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State
tUniversity.

tWe see PETER PARKER, a pleasant faced senior who's among
tthe top in his class. Sincere and serious, he has yet to
tdevelop a way with women.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(falling in step)
ttHiya Peter...

tLIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She's beautiful and
tintelligent.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(ardent but
tttuncomfortable)
ttHiya Liz... how're you doing...?

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(teasing softly)
ttHow'm I doing what?

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttPeter! Peter! Wait up!

tHARRY is the school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER,
tcan be a little backward around girls, especially pretty
tones like Liz.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttt(to Liz)
ttWould you, uh... excuse us for a minute?

tDespite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him
taway like a conspirator.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttWhat is it? what...

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttDid the Astro-Physics Journal really
ttaccept your paper?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(laughs, embarrassed)
ttYeah... well... all I got's the data but
ttthey've agreed to publish it when it's
ttfinished. You know... it's my
ttcalculation on the Planetary Conjunction.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttAnd its influence on the anti-force.
ttIsn't it?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttYes. Look, Harry, I am busy with...
ttt(indicates Liz standing
tttthere)

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttYeah, you and the rest of the class.
ttEvery one is busy with Liz.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(growing impatient)
ttPeter?

tA HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom.

<b>ttttFLASH
</b>ttHiya, cupcakes...

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(elbowing him
tttaffectionately)
ttFlash...!

tThey kiss and walk away.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttt(sneering)
ttAnd Flash is the busiest of them all...

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(disappointed)
ttCome on, Harry... we'll be late for
ttOctavius.

tHARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttOck is nuts, don't you agree?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttOck is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But,
tta genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.

<b>tINT. CYCLOTRON AREA HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tIt is a basement hallway full of LOCKERS which STUDENTS
tare banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take
tstuff out. In their midst, a MAN is banging on the door
tmarked "Cyclotron Room - Authorized Personnel Only!"
tProfessor ROSOMORF, SIXTISH, respectable, a good old
tfashioned professor, he's the head of the Physics Dept.
tWith him is ALEXANDER THORKEL, a 40-ish, Waspish school
tadministrator. For a scientist as crazily focused as OCK,
tTHORKEL is a natural enemy.

<b>ttttROZ
</b>ttt(knocking furiously)
ttDoctor Octavius! You are late for your
ttlecture. The students are waiting.
ttDoctor Octavius!

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttYour friend is impossible Professor
ttRosomorf, I told the board we should let
tthim go.

tThe LIGHT above THORKEL's head EXPLODES. Then all the
tLIGHTS behind him EXPLODE in succession. THORKEL and ROZ
tlook amazed...

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttWhat's he doing in there, not his crazy
ttexperiment again.

<b>ttttROZ
</b>ttYou mean his anti-force theory... one day
ttthey'll give him the Nobel Prize for it.

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttMeanwhile he is demolishing our
ttuniversity. Octavius!!
ttt(knocks)
ttOpen the door.

<b>tINT. OCK'S LAB
</b>
<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttThe anti-force experiment has now reached
ttthe limit of electronic overload safety.
ttTherefore, Weiner, you will disconnect
ttthe overload safety device...

tFOUR WALDOS (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms)
tsuddenly thrust themselves into the CHAMBER and begin
tworking, each at a different task. OCK is an acknowledged
tmaster at manipulating these WALDOS.

tHe flicks a switch and a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances
tdown from a FOCUSING CONE and strikes a GRAM WEIGHT
tmarked, "1,000,000"), illuminating it and filling our
tears with a splitting BUZZ TONE.

tThe knock on the door grows louder.
tWEINER comes up behind OCK.

<b>ttttWEINER
</b>ttWhoa, Doc... someone's at the door...

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(ignoring)
ttWorld class scientific mind and they
ttstick me in the basement with this third
ttrate cyclotron...

tINSERT: The DIAL marked "RELATIVE GRAVITY" reads
t"1,000,000" but suddenly it snaps to "0.999999!"

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttOkey! Dokey!

tThe WEIGHT begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it
tappears to lift ever so slightly.

<b>tINT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY
</b>
tThis is an enormous room, 100 lab tables. The yellowing
tsmoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air. A HUGE
tAMERICAN FLAG dominates the back wall.

tPETER, HARRY and LIZ set up their TABLES. FLASH reads the
tDAILY BUGLE sports section. PETER can't take his eyes off
tLIZ. When she looks back he looks down at his GEAR.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(softly)
ttWhat is it, Peter?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(embarrassed)
ttIt's nothing.

<b>tINT. OCK'S LAB
</b>
tWEINER opens the door and sees ROZ and THORKEL waiting
timpatient.

<b>ttttWEINER
</b>ttYes, gentleman can I help you?

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttTell your boss, that his class is waiting.

<b>ttttWEINER
</b>ttt(looks)
ttYou better tell him yourself.

tTHORKEL looks at ROZ who waves his shoulder, then the both
tcall.

<b>ttttROZ & THORKEL
</b>ttProfessor Octavius!!

tProfessor OCK turns and looks at the bewildered men.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttGentlemen, come, you must see this.

<b>ttttROZ
</b>ttBut, your students...

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttThe imbeciles can wait... I have better
ttthings to do than teach introductory
ttPhysics Rosomorf. Undergrads are
ttkindless adolescence.

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttYou see he is impossible.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttThorkel you are the dummiest
ttadministrator our university has ever had.
ttt(Thorkel turns to go)
ttDon't go Thorkel!! Come! Look!

tHe starts to play his machines handles and buttons.

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttThe university pays you to teach
ttsomething to your students.

<b>tINT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY
</b>
<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttWell, do you mean nothing... or do you
ttmean something but you won't tell me what
ttit is?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(regaining)
ttI mean plain nothing.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttWell, I guess that's about as nothing as
ttyou can get... plain nothing.
ttA beat.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttLiz...!

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttAhh, it is something.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttNo... look.

tThe equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They
tlook at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron's WHINE
tbegin to build...

<b>tINT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY
</b>
tEverything is shaking like in an earthquake... Roz and
tThorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with
tanger and surprise. The WHINE is deafening! The light is
tblinding! WEINER has his eyes closed and his hands over
this ears.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttI am going for 20 percent power!

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttNO!! Don't do that...

<b>ttttROZ
</b>ttOck! Its dangerous...

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttOck I warn you...

tWEINER crosses himself. The CONSOLE erupts in sparks.

<b>tINT. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY
</b>
tWe follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along
tthe WIRES and CABLES inside the WALLS and FLOORS. It is
tmaking its way up to the LAB!

<b>tINT. LAB - DAY
</b>
tAll the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating
tequipment.

tThe CHARGE crackles up a WIRE and erupts at LIZ'S TABLE.
tA BREAKER explodes in flames. There is an outburst of AD
tLIBS: "Fire!" "Everybody out!"

tTHORKEL (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing
tLIZ trapped behind the fire which is growing from second
tto second.

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttKeep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the
ttfront door. Everybody out the front.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttLiz! Come on...!

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttI can't. Help me!

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttI'm coming!

tHe wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES.
tHis sleeve is on fire. He pats it out.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttPeter!

tFlash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him.

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttGet back, you idiots. You can't go in
ttthere!

tLIZ smashes at the WINDOW, but this is an inner city
tschool and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES. Liz
twraps her fingers in the GATE.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(out at the street)
ttHelp! Help me!

tOutside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and
tgo. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the
tsecond floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course)
tdown at them as the FLAMES close in behind her.

tPETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He
tfumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the
textinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain.
tLIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an
teruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE
<b>tEXTINGUISHER.
</b>
tThe FLAMES are beaten down enough for her to leap out.
tFLASH is there, holding the EXTINGUISHER. People CHEER.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttThanks for your help Flash.

<b>ttttFLASH
</b>ttNo problem wimp.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttOur hero has a real way with words.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttOh, why don't you grow up.

tPETER is stung, insulted, turns away.
tROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel.

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttThis man will bring a disaster upon this
ttuniversity.

tOCK comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has
thappened.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttThe universe is made up of forces... and
ttcounter-forces. Science is the study of
ttthe forces!

tFLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces
tFLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely.
tHe looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on
tthe last of the FIRE.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(continues without a
ttthitch)
ttBut I... Professor Otto Octavius... have
ttdevoted my life to the study of the
ttcounter-forces! Good job, Peter.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(taking place at lab
ttttable)
ttThanks, Professor.

tTHORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the
tfront of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK'S
tbehavior.

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttI don't believe it, I simply don't...

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttCan we carry on Mr. Thorkel.

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttI don't believe... oh, all right carry on
ttProfessor.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttWell! This week my dear students I have
ttmade a stunning breakthrough...

<b>ttttTHORKEL
</b>ttWait a minute, wait a minute... you've
ttgot fire forms to fill out, Dr. Octavius.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttI have no time for forms, or
ttadministrators who persist in
ttinterrupting me, Mr. Thorkel.

tTHORKEL steams out and bangs shut the DOOR.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttI now believe its possible that these
ttcounter forces can be... collected... the
ttway the magnifying glass collects the
ttsunlight... and focused into a hard beam
ttI call... Weiner!

tWEINER backs away from the BLACKBOARD to reveal a word
tthat OCK has scrawled in large letters. It says "Anti-
tForce."

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttI call it, the Anti-Force!

tOCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with
ta SILVER BALL inside it.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(continues as he works)
ttThis anti-force, once harnessed, is
ttcapable of undoing any natural force at
ttwhich it is aimed... for instance...
ttt(looks up maniacally)
ttGravity!

tLIZ scribbles down a note and mouths the word "gravity."
tThen she turns to PETER.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(whispers)
ttI'm sorry...

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttIt's alright.

tOCK is "playing" his COMPUTER like the Phantom of the
tOpera at the organ.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttWe patch in the cyclotron...
ttThe lights flicker and go dim.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttPay no attention to the lights... I of
ttcourse steal its energy, and it looses
ttpower. We patch in the cyclotron... and
ttwe gradually apply power. The power that
ttI am stealing...

tAs the WHINE builds in the LAB...
tOCK peers through the LUCITE BOX at us, distorted by it.

tThe BOX is a miniature version of the cyclotron's
texperimental chamber, and now the BLUE-WHITE glow begins.
tIt crackles round the SILVER BALL.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttAnd so we stand, four square against the
ttfundamental force that orders and
ttmaintains our universe... gravity...
ttwhich is holding down this goddamn ball.
ttRise!

tThe LIGHTS go totally dark. The kids react with WHOOPS
tand CATCALLS.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttWhat a crock...

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttShut up Harry... this is very interesting.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttMr. Parker! Have you some... interesting
ttobservation you'd like to share with the
ttclass?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttNo sir...

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttThen shut up! And pay some attention to
ttthe experiment.

tOCK peers at us through the LUCITE BOX as the SILVER BALL
tbegins to rise. OCK'S face is ecstatic.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttRise! Rise!!!

tThe SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of
tthe box. It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a
<b>tLIGHT FIXTURE.
</b>
tThe shards rain down on OCK who reaches out and catches
tthe falling BALL and scales it in a raised fist.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttNow that's what I call an experiment!

tThe CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts out and OCK wheels to the
tCOMPUTER. He hits a KEY and several COLORED PROJECTION
tBEAMS lance out of the back of the room. They pierce the
tsmoke and light a PROJECTION DISPLAY in the front.

tTWO COLORED SPHERES one, YELLOW, one BLUE touch where
ttheir circumferences meet. Behind them is a BLACK
tdepiction of "space".

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttYou are looking at a representation of
tttwo universes. Our Blue one. Our real
ttuniverse... something we can touch and
ttfeel and see and draw calculations about.
ttThis is us. The Yellow universe... this
ttis something else. Some other dimension...
ttsomething... on the other side!

tOCK hits another COMPUTER KEY and a hole appears where the
tTWO SPHERES touch. The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE with
teach other. The colors swirl until both SPHERES are
<b>ttttBRIGHT GREEN.
</b>
<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttIf it were possible to generate enough
ttpower behind it, the anti-force could
ttwipe out not just gravity... but all our
ttuniversal forces at the same time. In
tteffect... it would blast a hole between
ttthis universe and the next. Each...
ttt(indicates green spheres)
ttwould flow into each other. No blue
ttuniverse. No yellow. End, finished,
ttover.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(with a student's ear)
ttThat sounds like a scenario for the end
ttof the world.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttMy girl, it is! It is. It would mean
ttwiping out everything that's known... and
ttletting in everything that's unknown.

<b>ttttFLASH
</b>ttIsn't that a little dangerous?

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttDon't worry yourself, true inter-
ttdimensional penetration is still purely
tttheoretical, but one day... Maybe very
ttnear... maybe in the 21st century...

<b>tINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tPETER, LIZ, FLASH and HARRY all take BOOKS from their
<b>tLOCKERS.
</b>
<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(whispers to Peter)
ttLook, it's just... I don't know... when
ttyou and Flash go after each other like
ttthat...

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(whispers)
ttHe's not my type.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttHe doesn't have to be.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttCheck.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttAnd besides, he's not all bad.

tPETER looks at FLASH who's a few LOCKERS down. FLASH has
ttaken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his
tfinger with great joy and concentration.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttYou don't get nicknamed Flash because
ttyou're a rocket scientist, Liz.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttGive it up, Parker. You'd die for a
ttnickname like Flash.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttYeah, of embarrassment.

tKIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is
ta ripe one and hot-hot-hot!

<b>ttttKIM
</b>ttt(teasing)
ttHey, Flash... I'm scalping a pair of the
ttMidnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow
ttnight.

<b>ttttFLASH
</b>ttThe Slammies??? I'd kill for that!!!

<b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWould you pay $125?

<b>ttttFLASH
</b>ttWell, uh, I... gee... if... can I tell
ttyou tomorrow?

<b>ttttKIM
</b>ttt(moving on)
ttYou snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz...

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttKim, you know Peter and Harry? This is
ttmy new roommate... Kim Nickson.

tKIM is pulling her pet, a foot long SALAMANDER, out of her
tLOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the
tboys.

tThey go bug-eyed!

<b>ttttKIM
</b>ttt(interested)
ttHellooo, Peter.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(embarrassed)
ttHi...

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttWe're going to the Student Reunion
ttMeeting. You coming?

tPeter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's
tadjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in
tthe ribs. Yeah, yeah!

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(frustrated)
ttI can't... I gotta go over to the Daily
ttBugle. I'm trying to sell some photos.

<b>ttttKIM
</b>ttSoooh, a photographer...?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttJust an amateur. Well... nice meeting
ttyou, Kim.

<b>ttttKIM
</b>ttYeah... I bet it would be.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttCan I be your date for the reunion
ttShooShoo?

<b>ttttKIM
</b>ttNo Jerk!

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttt(she turns to go)
ttWhat did I say...

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttIt's not what you said, it's how you say
ttit, ShooShoo!

tEverybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his
tbag down.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttDamn!

tPETER turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking
<b>tWEINER.
</b>
<b>ttttWEINER
</b>ttPeter, Doc Ock wants to see you.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttAbout my data I bet.

<b>ttttWEINER
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttHe knows about my work on the Planetary
ttConjunction, doesn't he?

<b>ttttWEINER
</b>ttt(lies)
ttI don't know.

<b>tINT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</b>
tPETER enters wide-eyed behind WEINER. This place is a far
tcry from the experiment in the LAB ROOM. It's a fantastic
tnetherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. No one
tbut PETER.

tOCK is sitting in a swivel CHAIR with his back to PETER.
tHe has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus. This is
tOCK'S domain.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttHello, Professor Octavius.
ttt(no response)
ttI really admired your experiment.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(back to Peter)
ttWe have a lot of interests in common,
ttPeter. Perhaps we should put our heads
tttogether, if you know what I mean...

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(flattered)
ttThat would be... great.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(turns with a smile)
ttNow you take the Planetary Conjunction.
ttThis Saturday night we will witness
ttSaturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the
ttSun... all in a row. Never seen within
ttthe memory of man, or measured for its
tteffect. The total gravitational force
ttmust be quite exceptional. Isn't that
ttthe subject of your paper...?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttYes sir, I've worked out a new way to
ttcalculate the combined gravitational
tteffect.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttI'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think
ttI could find the time to go over it with
ttyou. Make sure it all... checks out.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttWell... I'm sort of working with
ttProfessor Rosomorf and he suggested we
ttkind of keep it between us. He thinks
ttthat my theory is... well, I don't know...

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(to himself)
ttThe scoundrel...
ttt(turns angry)
ttI want to see that data, Peter!

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttBut Professor Octavius... if I knew you
ttwere interested... sorry, I've already
ttgiven it to... Professor Rosomorf, and he
ttis after all the head of our Physics
ttDepartment... and I couldn't...

tOCK turns sweet again. He smiles too broadly.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttWell, I'm certain something can be worked
ttout. Run along, young man.

tPETER begins to leave.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttJust a minute... how about if I show you
ttmy discoveries... something I never
ttshowed to any other student... as a
ttmatter of fact to anybody at all.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttWell I am really flattered, I mean I'd
ttlove to... but I...

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttVery well shall we say if you come here
tttonight...

</b>ttWell, Professor, that would be a great

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttNoble Shmoble, I am going for a much
ttbigger prize kid. Okey, dokey. Let me
ttshow you, kid, what I got here.

tOCK begins the experiment. We move in past the shattered
tWINDOW. We see the SPIDER crawling on the chamber's GEAR.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttPresent maximum anti-force power to date
ttis 38 percent of theoretical limit. I
tthave patched in the variable
ttparticle-wave accelerator...

ttI will now try to reach 50% power...

ttAnd if your paper has any value... I can

ttand beat any other form of power in our
ttor any other universe, capish!

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttSorry, Professor, I can't do it. I gave
ttmy word to Professor Rosomorf.

tOCK is angry... Ock now sees the SPIDER. He shoots out a
tWALDO to try and crush it but the SPIDER is too fast. The
tWALDO slams against the wall of the chamber. He starts to
tpush every button or switch in sight. A deafening whining
tstarts.

tAn URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the "Relative
tGravity" DIAL. It is at "4.999999KG" but suddenly the
tnumbers start to tumble rapidly.

tINSERT: The glowing 5KG WEIGHT.
tINSERT: The POWER DIAL inches toward 50% POWER!

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(screaming)
tt50 percent... anti-force... 50 percent...
ttthat's all I'm missing! Parker, we can
ttbe rich together!

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttSorry... I'd better go now.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(really angry now)
ttYou'll be sorry, Parker.

tPETER leaves.

tAnother URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the
tmonitor SCREEN. On it, flashing RED, is the word,
t"OVERLOAD!" OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward!
tThe WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB.

<b>tINT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

tIncredibly lit, the SPIDER is dropping on it's shimmering
tWEB-STRAND down toward the 5KG WEIGHT which now GLOWS in
ttime with the THROB and PULSE.

tThe MONITOR is flashing "MAXIMUM OVERLOAD - SHUT DOWN!"
tOCK continues with the experiment. And then he sees the
<b>tSPIDER!
</b>
<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttYou! Get out of there, you creeping...

tHe tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand.

<b>tINT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tThrough the BLUE-WHITE we can barely make out OCK on the
tother side if the shattered WINDOW. He sends TWO WALDOS
tafter the SPIDER. The SPIDER evades him and jumps onto
tthe PROFESSOR's back. It then climbs onto the PROFESSOR's
tneck and bites him.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(anguish)
ttNoooooooooooo!

tThe gravity DIAL goes to .000001, then pops back up as
tOCK'S tiny world goes berserk. DIALS spin, crack, explode
tor droop liquidly. WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which
terupts like the 4th of JULY.

tOCK begins to float. His shirt begins to tear away. A
tDIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a
tMedusa. WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like
tsnakes. OCK'S YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES!
tOCK, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-G grimace, is
tpinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with
<b>tSPARKS.
</b>
<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(ecstasy above the din)
ttIt's an energy storm! Okey! Dokey!

tWe see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck.
tThe big beast buffets and shakes. Tubes, junctions,
tvalves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where
tthey twitch and writhe with a life of their own.

tThen, an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the
tCYCLOTRON's side, sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO-
tSTREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction.

<b>tINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

tUltimate weirdness! The PULSING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT
tpenetrates first the DOOR of the CYCLOTRON ROOM and then
tthe very walls! LOCKERS bang, LAMPS POP, the ceiling sags
tin a SURREAL, RUBBERY way.

tThe WALLS sag too! The CYCLOTRON SIGN pivots and embeds
titself in a WALL. A LADDER sinks in the WALL. The BLUE-
tWHITE LIGHT dances wildly about in PULSES. Then,
tsuddenly, it stops... DEAD SILENCE. WEINER comes running
tin holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of
tPepsi. Weiner enters OCK'S lab, singing, not at first
tnoticing what's going on. Suddenly he stops dead.

<b>tINT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tA scene out of DALI's surrealistic canvas. There are
tthings inside of other things. DIALS look like DALI
twatches. This place has been rippled to the max!
tOCK lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a WALDO across
this chest. The SPIDER is weaving its web. CAMERA slowly
tDOWN to see OCK. PIPES and WIRES are stuck to his body.
tThe WALDO seems to be wrapping him. He wakes up to see
tthose MECHANICAL ARMS buried in his body. They weave
taround him as if they are looking for prey. He tries to
ttear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body,
tlike his other limbs. He screams. Suddenly Weiner sees
<b>tOCK.
</b>
<b>ttttWEINER
</b>ttProfessor... what happened to you? What

tflies back and out through the door to the corridor.

tignominiously in a heap. He's torn his PANTS and cut his
tleg. He moves to the side of the building.

tA DUMPSTER sits next to a FIRE DOOR. It's locked. As

tAs PETER looks out at the STRETCHER, the SPIDER drops on

tto clear it. His vision becomes uncertain. He lurches
tagainst a WEIRD SINK.

tPETER'S POV is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not
tjust moving in and out anamorphically. It's all of that!

<b>ttttGUARD (V.O.)
</b>ttt(heavily distorted)
ttHey! What are you doing here, kid?

tPETER turns to see a UNIFORMED GUARD distorted by his
tcrazy vision.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttI feel a little funny...

<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttt(heavily distorted)
ttYeah? Well, I ain't laughing. Get out...
ttJust get out of here...

<b>tEXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

tIt bangs open. The GUARD throws PETER out and then throws
this BACK PACK at him.

ttYou get yourself over to the Police lines.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(ultra wooz)
ttRight. Police lines.

<b>tEXT. UNIVERSITY - NIGHT
</b>
tPETER melds into the crowd. As in a dream, JAMESON
tappears at his side.

<b>ttttJAMESON
</b>ttt(distorted)
ttOkay, scoop, whaddaya got?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttI... got pictures of the Professor... in
ttthere... it's so strange in there... so

</b>ttt(winks)
ttGood job, kid. Bizarre is what we need.
ttPick this up in the morning.
ttt(holding up his camera)
ttThere'll be two crisp twenties tucked
ttinside.

tHe hurries off. PETER peers after him and all of a sudden
this vision corrects to a perfect focus. The sweat is
tgone. He's okay. He makes his way through the crowd to
tthe street.

tWe TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind
thim. He turns a corner. He hears a SIREN.

tAn AMBULANCE screeches around the corner. It nearly hits
tPETER who leaps to avoid it.

<b>tEXT. BRICK BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
tPETER'S cheek is pressed against the brick. He opens his
teyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the
tbuilding like a spider. And he's three stories up!
tHe looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him!
tAnd the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away.
tHe tries a downward step, but a BRICK dislodges and
tcrashes to the sidewalk. He takes an upward step. And
tthen another.

tTentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he
t"crawls" to the roof of the building. At the top he
tgropes for a RAILING and slips. He dangles eight stories
tabove the street. Then, with a grunt, he vaults to the
troof one-handed.

<b>tEXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT
</b>
tPETER is flat on his back, staring at the stars. He sits
tup and looks wonderingly at his hands.

tOn the back of his right hand are TWO PUNCTURE WOUNDS
tsurrounded by a faint BLUE-WHITE PULSING GLOW. The GLOW
tdisappears.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(mutters to himself)
ttThis is weird. My God, I feel so weird...

tHe leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good
tWeird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of
t"jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the
tair!

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(exhilarated)
ttVery weird.

tThe great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as
tPETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air.
tWith the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps
tfrom the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL
twhere he lands sideways and sticks.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(sideways)
ttVery, very weird.

tHe leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof.
tHe looks down. No one's looking back. So, he takes a
tstep back and leaps the alley to the next roof.

<b>tEXT. ROOFTOP SHACK - NIGHT
</b>
tPETER lands on it. The next roof is seven stories up and
tacross the street. PETER bites his lip.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttWell, what the hell!!

<b>tEXT. THE TALLER BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
tBacklit by a FULL MOON, PETER somersaults to the roof of
tthe taller building, and misses the top!

tHe sticks to the brick FACADE, upside down! He laughs
twith the moment. A WINDOW opens below him and a pretty
tBLONDE in a TOWEL sticks her head out. She looks this way
tand that, and all she sees is a MAN in a LOUD SPORTCOAT
tdown the street. Never thinking to look up, she withdraws
tinto the room.

<b>tEXT. CHELSEA STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tThe MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT leans against a LAMP POST
tand lights a CIGARETTE with a BEAT UP, SILVER PLATED
<b>tLIGHTER.
</b>
tIn the LIGHTER he sees a reflection of PETER leaping off
tthe taller building. He snaps around and looks up in time
tto see PETER make it to the next FACADE.

<b>tEXT. ROOFTOP MONTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
tWith the UPTOWN SKYLINE behind him, PETER casts caution to
tthe wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop.

tWatching from the street, the MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT
tfollows PETER'S progress.

tPETER leaps to a BROWNSTONE and lands amid the WASH.
tHe leaps up to a TENEMENT and lands on a BILLBOARD across
twhich he does a "bug crawl" and leaps again.

tHe touches down on a PIGEON COOP and bounds up and out of
tframe again. The COOP OWNER, a LATINO in an undershirt
tand a YANKEES CAP, comes running out of the COOP.

tHe's so surprised that he leaves the DOOR open and twenty
tWHITE MORNING DOVES fly away in a furious flapping, free
tat last. The LATINO lets out a stream of Hispanic
texpletives complete with all the appropriately obscene
tgestures.

tPETER slides down a CABLE to a LAMP POST, and swirls down
tthe POLE to a PHONE BOOTH.

<b>tEXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

tPETER comes face to face with the man in the LOUD
tSPORTCOAT. He gives PETER his CARD.

tThinking they're shooting at him, WEINER shoots back. In
tthe corner of his eye he sees SPIDER-MAN at a side WINDOW.
tHe aims his rifle and SPIDEY ducks out of the way.
tThe frightened WEINER moves to the side WINDOW to blow
tSPIDEY away. As he moves past the front WINDOWS he is lit
tby the SEARCHLIGHTS that play on his face darkly.
tSPIDEY leaps in at FRONT WINDOW and drops neatly behind
tWEINER, landing a pose.

tcascades of COLOR.

ttHey, creep!

tWEINER aims and fires, several times. He is emptying his

tmarked "CAUTION-FLAMMABLE SOLVENT!"

ttTry again.

tThe CASK gives way and SPIDEY is plunged into the
tFLAMMABLE SOLVENT. WEINER smiles his stupid grin and
ttakes aim.

tSPIDEY leaps out of the CASK and sticks to the roof BEAM.
tHe's sopping wet. His hand slips down the BEAM as the
tSOLVENT works against his sticking power.

tHe falls to the floor and scrambles behind some PAINT
tCANS. WEINER, crazed, fires wildly. One of the CANS
tEXPLODES. PAINT flows from it... burning!

tSPIDEY peeks out and sees a YELLOW RIVER OF FLAME creeping
ttoward him. He sniffs his SOLVENT soaked outfit.

tHe backs down a "corridor" of PAINT CANS. The YELLOW FIRE
tfollows, now joined by a RIVER OF BLUE FIRE from another
tcan. They're following the trail of SOLVENT he's

tSPIDEY is inches from being torched. He sees a PIPE. He
treaches out and grabs it. He swings out above the flames.
tBut the PIPE begins to bend!

tThe PIPE bends down... down... and then breaks! SPIDEY
thangs precariously as WATER cascades out of the PIPE and
tputs out the FIRE.

tSPIDEY drops down and rest his head in his hands to

tPETER springs into action. He grabs his SPIDEY SUIT out
tof a drawer and starts taking off his clothes.

tLIZ looks back and sees OCK CARTWHEELING toward her. She
tcan't outrun him. She must hide. There's a CONSTRUCTION
tSITE on the right. She ducks down the alley next to it.

<b>tINT. CONSTRUCTION ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
tLIZ runs into it and finds herself trapped on three sides
tby a high CYCLONE FENCE. Behind her, OCK'S WALDOS stretch
tout like waterbug legs. He bug-walks into the alley and
tlaughs down at her from his perch atop the WALDOS.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttPeter Parker has something I want... And
ttI'm going to have something he wants.

tShe dashes past him and runs into the outboard CARGO

</b>

tShe looks for the UP BUTTON and finds nothing! OCK, on
this feet now, is on the wire mesh ELEVATOR CAGE in a
tflash. He tears the outer DOOR away.

tLIZ starts pressing KNOBS and LEVERS in panic. The LIGHT
tgoes on. A WARNING BELL clangs. She finally finds the
tswitch and the CAR leaps up just as OCK tears off its
tfront door.

tLIZ, safe for the moment, watches OCK recede below,
tshaking the torn off door in a rage.

<b>tEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

tExtending WALDO over WALDO, OCK climbs the ELEVATOR
tHOUSING chasing the rising CAR inside.

<b>tEXT. CONSTRUCTION ROOF - NIGHT
</b>
tThe CAR arrives and LIZ jumps out. She's on nothing but a
tnarrow GIRDER! She tightropes on the GIRDER. OCK gets to
tthe top. He looks across at her. She's stuck between two
tunfastened GIRDERS, at a dead end. He slowly telescopes a
tWALDO toward her. She's got no place to run, no place to
thide. He grabs her by the BLOUSE and lifts her off the
<b>tGIRDER.
</b>
<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN (V.O.)

</b>ttI know what's happening to you, Ock.
ttI've been through a lot of changes myself
ttlately. You have to listen to me.

</b>ttI'm a good friend of Peter Parker's Ock.
ttJust like that girl you're holding. Now

tOCK thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the
tkicking and screaming LIZ out over the street, ten stories
tup.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttLet her go? What an excellent idea. If
ttyou do not deliver your friend, Mr.
ttSpider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I'll
ttlet her go.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttPut me down, you mechanical mutant!

tLIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She
ttwists. She flails around, making things a little worse.
tThe ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP!
tPART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets!
tSPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his
tcharacteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the
tfalling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(falling away)
ttYou jerk!

tHe THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to
ta HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound.

ttTell your friend Peter next time I'll get
ttthe taxi myself...

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(screams)
ttHey... you jerk... you phony Spider-Man...
ttPrepare to meet your death, bug.

tSPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttt(whispers)
ttActually, I'm rather fond of living...

ttt(he looks at Liz)

tHe lands on OCK'S GIRDER and the two progeny of the

tthe street.

</b>ttt(a last appeal to reason)
ttOctavius. Just stop and think.

</b>ttI am thinking, insect. I'm thinking
ttabout exterminating you!

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttOkay, if that's the way you want it...
ttLet's see what those chrome knuckles can
ttdo, Doc...

tA WALDO lances out and catches SPIDEY flush on the jaw.
tIt knocks him to another GIRDER. SPIDEY hangs on and
trolls over. He rubs his jaw.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttGreat...

tSPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by
tanother barrage of blows from above.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttNow I must kill you, you cretinous clown.

tOCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY
toff the GIRDER. He's just barely hanging on.
tBut SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and
tswings into a better attack position. The two SUPER-
tADVERSARIES engage in battle.

tWith OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and
tSPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY,
tthey clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the

</b>

</b>ttOnce I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one
ttwill be able to stop me.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttStop you from what...?

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttMy destiny!

tOCK throws his biggest punch yet.

tSIRENS can now be heard in the street.

tSPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes
tWEB after WEB. But SPIDEY'S agility soon has him turning
tcircles.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttOver here, Octopus!

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttThat's Professor Octopus to you Spider
ttJerk!

tSpeeding along the BRIDGE, OCK sees no one. But high
tabove, SPIDEY swings from TOWER to TOWER after him. At
tthe last TOWER, SPIDEY leaps down onto a BIG TRUCK. The
tVETTE weaves and SPIDEY crosses to another BIG TRUCK. For
ta moment he is caught between the TWO TRUCKS, but he makes
tit across.

tThe VETTE takes an exit. SPIDEY leaps to the next SIGN.
tHe aims his WRIST GIZMO and waits for the next car to take
tthe exit, but none does. Deflated, he drops to the

tsays, "DUMP NUMBER 7 -- KEEP OUT -- RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!"

tOCK hurls a DRUM at SPIDEY. It erupts in a sizzle of

tOCK comes flying out and SPIDER-MAN grabs a WALDO.
tSPIDEY does a back flip and whips OCK so hard the WALDO
tsnaps off! OCK recoils it and reacts in horror.
tWith a roar, OCK attacks SPIDER-MAN. They battle as
tSUPER-ADVERSARIES. OCK gains the upper hand and tosses
tSPIDEY into a pile of RUSTING DRUMS. A GAS envelopes
tSPIDER-MAN and he begins coughing.

tOCK'S WALDOS are coiled around SPIDER-MAN'S neck as the
tWEB SLINGER is dragged through the dump. His WHITE EYES
tnarrow and blink. There is a capped WELL behind a WARNING

tSPIDEY down the WELL.

tSPIDEY falls. He cannot grab onto the slimy WALLS. At

ttOkay now, Spidey. Easy does it.

tHe shoots a WEB about halfway up the PIT. It hits the

ttDon't give up, Spidey. Don't give up.

tThe WEB GIZMO squirts out a pathetic patooey of WEB GOO.

tOCK appears in the HOLE. He sees SPIDEY'S dilemma,
thanging on a thread of WEB. A half-broken WALDO snakes
tdown and CLIPS the WEB.

tBut the WEB sticks to the WALDO! OCK shakes it, but he
tcan't get loose. SPIDER-MAN shoots out another WEB at the
tROCK BOTTOM and, with the leverage, he pulls OCK out.
tOCK swings down in a wide arc and his WALDOS catch on the
tROCK upside down. He holds on fiercely.

tOCK scrambles out to the side of the CENTER and begins
tlooking for an entry. SPIDER-MAN is right on his tail.
tThe building pitches sideways! OCK turns to face SPIDER-
tMAN, his broken WALDOS out for BATTLE.

tSPIDEY grabs an EXPOSED PIPE and breaks it off,
tbrandishing it like a broad sword.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttLet's have it, old boy!
ttA bizarre DUEL takes place. The CENTER pitches this way
ttand that. SPIDEY and OCK move from foothold to foothold,
ttfrom WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET.

tNow the CENTER pitches to a 45 degree angle. They DUEL
tupside down! A WINDOW GRATE crashes open and LIZ comes
tflying out, holding onto the GRATE for dear life!

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttLiz!!
ttOCK seizes the opportunity to whack SPIDEY across the
tthead. SPIDEY loses his footing but the building now
ttlurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside. SPIDEY
ttducks inside too and pulls the GRATE.

tSPIDER-MAN uses his great strength to move a HUGE PIECE of
tSCIENTIFIC MACHINERY in front of the GRATE.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttCome on.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttWhere's Peter? He must be here somewhere.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttt(pulling her ahead)
ttHe's around, don't worry... we'll find
tthim.

<b>tINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tThe COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, "00:01:00" as SPIDEY comes
tflying in with LIZ in tow.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttThis building is flying. I'm in a
ttgoddamn flying building...

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttI think we have to pull some of these
ttcables. Try those over there. I'll work
tton these. We gotta slow this thing down
ttsomehow. We got helicopters coming.

tLIZ looks at some WIRING, apprehensive about even touching
tit.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttPull!

tShe yanks out a CABLE. The building pitches. But when
tSPIDEY pulls one out, it rights itself.

<b>tEXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT
</b>
tThe BIG BEAMS start cutting out one by one. The CENTER
tbegins to PITCH and YAW. The CHOPPERS are getting closer.

<b>tINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tThe COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:00:15" as SPIDEY and LIZ
tcontinue to pull WIRES and CABLES. TWO WALDOS erupt
tthrough the floor and grab SPIDEY. They pull SPIDEY to
tthe floor. Entangled in these molybdimum pythons, SPIDEY
tstruggles valiantly. LIZ leaps to his aid.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttOh my God...

tA third WALDO, a broken one, snakes up from the HOLE and
tbegins feeling blindly around on the CONSOLE for the POWER
<b>tTHROTTLE.
</b>
<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttThe power!

tLIZ sees the damaged WALDOS heading for the RED THROTTLE.
tThe COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at "00:00:10". LIZ leaps and tries
tto wrestle it away. It whips in her arms and she holds on
ttight. It bangs her against the wall and then the
tCONSOLE. She holds on. "00:00:03". The WALDO crashes
tLIZ against the wall which erupts in SPARKS. She lets go
tof it. It heads for the POWER THROTTLE! "00:00:01!"
tSPIDER-MAN can't break the grip of the WALDOS, but he can
tpull with super-human strength. He yanks OCK up through
tthe STONE floor. OCK hits the ceiling of the CONTROL
tROOM. ONE WALDO grabs on. The other one throws the RED
<b>tPOWER THROTTLE!
</b>
<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttSpider-Man. You're end is coming. Life
ttin its present form is ending... new
ttdimensions, new horizons...

tThe UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW. The GLOW sharpens to
ta POINT of LIGHT. SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a
trushing ENERGY FLOW that's pulling everything in the room
ttowards the POINT of LIGHT.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(bracing against the storm)
ttWhat is happening?

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttt(similarly braced)
ttI don't know!!!

tLIZ starts to slip away into the flow. She struggles
tagainst it.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttI can't... hold on!

tSPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttHold tight, Liz, hold tight!

tOCK drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room.
tHe moves slowly, under his own power, into the LIGHT.

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttt(spaced out)
ttYou cut my power... there's too little
ttpower... It's so tiny... so tiny...
ttthere's only space... for me. But I've
ttdone it, Spider-Man. I have broken
ttthrough... I've broken through!

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttDon't do it, Dr. Octavius!

<b>ttttOCK
</b>ttOkey... dokey... Now that's what I call
ttan experiment!!!

tAs he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it.
tHe radiates LIGHT. He shimmers and shines. He fills the
troom with BLINDING LIGHT.

tSPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes, and as the light
tdiminishes, the storm subsides. They're safe. Except for
tthe fact that they're in a floating building, 10,000 feet
tabove the city!

<b>tEXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT
</b>
tAgainst the backdrop of the MOON, a SQUADRON of
tHELICOPTERS approaches the CENTER. From their POV, a HUGE
tCRACK opens across the face of the building. The CENTER
tbegins to drop in PULSING SURGES.

<b>tINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tSPIDER-MAN is at the CONSOLE pulling and putting back
tWIRES. LIZ, fascinated, looks in at the WINDOW where OCK
tdisappeared.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttI can't control her. She's dropping too
ttfast! Alright... let's go!

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttBut what about Peter? We've got to find
ttPeter!

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttPeter will be okay, I promise you...
ttLet's go before it's too late.
ttt(he grabs her)

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttGo where?

<b>tEXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT
</b>
tIt rotates and drops. The HELICOPTERS come in like the
tcavalry.

<b>tINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tTrying to leave it, LIZ and SPIDEY are confronted with a
tnightmare. The room is tilted at a 45% angle. PIPES are
tbursting. SPIDEY helps LIZ through the obstacles. Debris
trains down. They come face to face with a diagonal maze
tof PIPES.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttMaybe there's another way...

tA HUGE CRACK opens above them.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttIt's breaking apart!

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttAlright, keep moving, a step at a time!

tThey scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side,
thalf the floor falls away! Central Park awaits, 8,000
tfeet below.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttWe have to go back.

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttWe can't go back.

tHe looks across at the door. It is midway up a diagonal
twall. He shoots a WEB up at the ceiling between
tthemselves and the door. Then he extends a hand to LIZ.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttForget it...

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttOkay, have it your way.

tHe swings across and lands on the LEDGE of the DOOR. Then
the swings the WEB back to her like a trapeze.
tLIZ catches the WEB and looks across at SPIDER-MAN,
tfurious.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(shouting across)
ttWhat am I supposed to do with this!

<b>ttttSPIDER-MAN
</b>ttt(shouting back)
ttGo ahead. It's easier than it looks!
ttWe've got to try the fire escape.

tLIZ swings across like TARZAN and SPIDEY gathers her in on
tthe LEDGE. She does a comic "phew" and the LEDGE buckles
tbeneath them but holds. SPIDER-MAN tries to open the
tdoor, but it's stuck.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttThe door is stuck.

tSPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task. It take all his
tstrength, but with a comic AAAAARGGHH! He bends the DOOR
topen.

<b>tEXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
tThey burst out onto the ROCK FOUNDATION of the building.
tNew York is rushing up to meet them. The WIND created by
ttheir fall buffets them. The HELICOPTERS arrive, and the
tfalling building plunges right past them. The HELICOPTERS
tlook across at each other, helpless.

<b>tEXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT
</b>
tIt drops like a stone.

<b>tEXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
tSPIDEY and LIZ are falling away from the DOOR, sliding
talong the ROCK. LIZ is stopped by a RETAINING WALL.
tSPIDEY keeps sliding. He THWIPS the wall and then
tdisappears over the edge. LIZ screams!

tLIZ fights to her feet and grabs onto the WEB STAND. She
tpulls on it with all her strength. She pulls and pulls
tand pulls. We see the WEB running up between the ROCKS.
tShe gives one last pull and comes up with an EMPTY WEB
<b>tEND.
</b>
tA long, long beat.

<b>ttttPETER (V.O.)
</b>ttLiz, Up here!

tLIZ looks up and sees PETER hanging out the WINDOW two
tstories above her. He throws out a ROPE LADDER. LIZ
tgrabs it. She begins to climb.

<b>tINT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tPETER pulls LIZ through the WINDOW. There is no time for
tan embrace.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttCome on. I've found a way down.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttt(at long last, love)
ttI knew you were going to say that.

tThey run out of the ROOM. We PAN down and see, crumpled
tbeneath the WINDOW, the SPIDER-MAN suit.

<b>tINT. LARGE PHYSICS LAB - NIGHT
</b>
tThis is the LAB we saw in the opening sequence. PETER has
tturned on the lights. He's got a handful of ROPE.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttWhere's the way out?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttRight there!

tWe are looking at the HUGE AMERICAN FLAG.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttCome on, help me with this.

<b>tEXT. THE FOUNDATION - NIGHT
</b>
tLIZ is already down the ROPE LADDER and is holding it for
tPETER. He comes down with a HUGE bundle of RED, WHITE &
<b>tBLUE.
</b>
<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttOkay, stand still.

tHe ties some ROPE around her waist.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttIs this going to work?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttHow do I know?

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttI just adore confidence in a man.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttCome on...

tThey move to the edge of the ROCK and look down. CENTRAL
tPARK is still a couple thousand feet down.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttWhat is it you say when you jump?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttYour prayers.

tThey SCREAM as the building lurches again, knocking them
tto the ground. They start to slide across the ROCK. They
treach out for each other but their hands don't quite
treach.

tSlowly, they inch back together, but the FOUNDATION cracks
tbetween them.

<b>tEXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT
</b>
tIt spins and falls beneath us. Down, down it goes. And
tthen it crashes into the GREAT LAWN. A huge cloud of
tdebris shoots upward.

<b>tEXT. THE SKY - NIGHT
</b>
tThere is a beautiful FULL MOON. PETER and LIZ float down
tinto the frame lit by its wonderful light.

tThe AMERICAN FLAG which has turned into a huge parachute.
tThey hold each other tight. They can hear SIRENS below.
tThey begin to laugh with relief. Then they stop. The
twind billows LIZ'S skirt and plays with PETER'S hair, and
tsnaps in the AMERICAN FLAG.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttWe have a lot to thank your friend
ttSpider-Man for.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttSomehow, I don't think we've seen the
ttlast of him.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttPeter...! Finders, keepers...

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttWhat...? What is it? Why do you look
ttlike that?

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttI think I'm in love.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(even his eyes blush)
ttYou are...

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttWith your friend...

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttSpider-Man? You're in love with
ttSpider-Man?

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttI am... you think we'll see him again?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttWe might... you never know.
ttHe kisses her.

<b>ttttLIZ
</b>ttOh.
ttt(bittersweet)
ttThis may be the end of a beautiful
ttfriendship you know?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttNah.

tThey land in the center of the park under the parachute.
tThey stay there and kiss... completely covered by the
tflag. Camera pulls up to show the building floating away.

<b>tTHE END
