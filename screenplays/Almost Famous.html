<b>tttttUNTITLED
</b>
<b>t1tFADE INtttttttt1
</b>
tA close-shot of a yellow legal tablet.  A young hand comes
tinto frame, holding a pencil.  For a few moments, we hear only
tthe soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written
tin a series of dissolves.  The hand carefully erases and
tcorrects an error or two along the way.  And then the sound of
tan old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we
tnow hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' "Christmas Song."

<b>t2tEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAYttttt2
</b>
tA lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky.  Behind
tit, the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of
tSan Diego.  A dry, hot Southern California day.  Even the wind
tis lazy, and a little bored.

<b>t3tEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTER - DAYtttt3
</b>
tSanta Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he
tcollects for the Salvation Army.  This is Christmas in the
tSouthland.  No snow, no winter wonderland.  Just a pleasantly
tthick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues.

tTurning the corner, walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER, 35.
tShe is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's

tHaving with her pale young son WILLIAM, late pre-teens.  They
tstand apart from the other shoppers.  All around them is the
thighly-charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering
tfake Christmas trees.  She hurries her son through the
tcommercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual
tconversation, when something stops her.  A Workman is affixing
tletters to a store-front.  He has already placed the MERRY...
tnow he's finishing the XMAS.  Elaine is strong, but always
tpleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttExcuse me, I'm a teacher.  There is no
tttword in The English Language -- "Xmas."
tttIt's either <i>Merry Christmas...</i> or <i>Happy
tttHolidays.</i>

tThe Workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as Mom turns
taway.  The Workman shares a look with William, who shrugs -
tthat's my Mom.

<b>tTITLE: 1969
</b>
<b>t4tEXT.  MINI-TRACT CONDO COMPLEX -- DAYtttt4
</b>
tThis is the new professional-class.  It's a mini-condo
tcommunity.  Rows of Spanish-styled three-bedroom houses with
tcommon walls.   Move in on one of these homes, the one without
tChristmas lights.  At the door is a furtive 15 year-old Girl.
tShe checks her cheek, straightens her hair.  She hides
tsomething under her coat, and gathers the proper nonchalance
tto enter.  Music fades.

<b>t5tINT. KITCHEN -- DAYtttttt5
</b>
tWe now hear the dialogue between this lively Mother and her
tson, as she cooks a pan full of soy-based health-food cutlets.
tThe meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan.  Across the kitchen
twe see William.  He's a great listener, with a calm and curious
tface that takes everything in.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>ttt- so Livia -

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>ttt-- killed everyone off so her son
tttTiberius could inherit the throne.
tttt(thoughtful pause)
tttJust like Nixon.

tWilliam nods, intrigued.  He has a good disposition.  The
tworld of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings
tout in his Mom.  There is a small clatter at the front door,
tas the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes.
tShe silently curses herself.

tttttELAINE (cont'd)
tttAnita, is that you?

<b>tttttANITA'S VOICE
</b>tttHey Mom!  I already ate.

tMom moves to the living room to greet William's sister.  William
tpeers into the next room.

<b>t6tINT. LIVING ROOM -- DAYtttttt6
</b>
tShe's almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches
ther.  We now discover ANITA, 16, up-close.  She is an alluring
tyoung Natalie Wood, with a suspicious and sunny smile.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttYou sure?  I'm making soy cutlets.

tThe words "soy cutlets" sends a small shiver through the girl.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttI'm fine.  Already ate.

tWilliam stands in the doorway now, watching, monitoring, as
tMom moves closer to his sister.  She sees something curious
tabout her daughter.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttWait.  You've been kissing.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttt(too quickly)
tttNo I haven't.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(peering at her lips)
tttYes... yes, you have...

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttNo I haven't.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttYes you have.  I can tell.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttt(boldly)
tttYou can't tell.

tMom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully.
tTo her, everything is a quest for knowledge.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttNot only can I <i>tell</i>, I know who it is.
tttIt's Darryl.

tAnita is stunned silent.  She turns slightly to look at herself
tin a hall mirror, searching for clues, implicating herself
timmediately.

tttttELAINE (cont'd)
tttAnd what have you got under your coat?

tThis is the booty Anita didn't want to give up.  Mom picks at
tthe corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket.
tShe withdraws the album. It's Simon and Garfunkel's <i>Bookends.</i>

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttt(busted)
tttIt's unfair that we can't listen to
tttour music!

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(weary of the issue)
tttHoney, it's all about drugs and
tttpromiscuous sex.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttSimon and Garfunkel is poetry!

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttYes it's poetry.  It's the poetry of
tttdrugs and <i>promiscuous sex.</i>  Look at
tttthe picture on the cover...

<b>tCLOSE ON BOOKENDS ALBUM COVER
</b>
tMom's fingers at the edges.  We examine the insolent faces on
tRichard Avedon's classic album cover.  Even Simon and Garfunkle
tlook guilty under her scholarly inspection.

tttttELAINE (cont'd)
ttt... honey, they're on <i>pot.</i>

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttFirst it was butter, then sugar and
tttwhite flour.
tttt(beat)
tttBacon. Eggs, bologna, rock and roll,
tttmotorcycles.

tNearby, William squirms as he watches the gently escalating
tconversation.  Anita glances at her brother.  He silently
turges her to downshift.  She can't.

tttttANITA (cont'd)
ttt<i>Then</i> it was celebrating Christmas on a
tttday in September When you knew it
tttwouldn't be "commercialized."

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttThat was an experiment.  But I
tttunderstand -

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttWhat else are you going to ban?

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttHoney, you want to rebel against
tttknowledge.

tttttELAINE (cont'd)
tttI'm trying to give you the Cliff's
tttNotes on how to live in this world.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttt(simple and direct)
tttWe're like nobody else I know.

tThese are the words that sting Mom most.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttI'm a teacher.  Why can't I teach my
tttown kids?
tttt(pats chest)
ttt<i>Use me.</i>

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttDarryl says you use knowledge to keep
tttme down.  He says I'm a "yes" person
tttand you're trying to raise us in a
ttt"no" environment!

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(immediately, can't help
tttit)
tttWell, clearly, "no" is a word Darryl
tttdoesn't hear much.

tAnita gasps.  Ever the peacemaker, William weighs in.  Nearby
tis a poster - "No More War."

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttMom --

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttEverything I say is wrong.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttI can't live here!  I hate you!  <i>Even
tttWilliam hates you!</i>

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI don't hate her.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttt(to William)
tttYou don't even know the truth!

tWilliam looks vaguely confused.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttSweetheart, don't be a drama queen.

tAnita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the
tstrangled-sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for
tthe first time.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>ttt<i>Feck</i>  you!  All of you!

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttHey!

tAnita runs down the hall to her room.  Elaine turns to William,
trelating to him more as a fellow parent than a child.

tttttELAINE (cont'd)
tttWell, there it is.  Your sister using
tttthe "f" word.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI think she said <i>"feck."</i>

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(sputtering)
ttt<i>What's the difference?</i>

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(encouraging)
tttWell.  The letter "u"...

tShot moves in on the kid, as we hear the opening strains of
tThe Moody Blues' "Nights in White Satin."

<b>t7tINT.   SCHOOL DANCE/GYMNASIUM BATHROOM -- NIGHTttt7
</b>
tMusic continues.  Shot moves along a row of very mature-looking
tmale teenagers, examining themselves in the bathroom mirror.
tThere's the kid with a very mature-looking moustache, the  kid
tproudly sporting full-blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some
t<i>Hai Karate</i>), the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the
tface of an adult, complete with long jutting sideburns... and
tthen a blank space at the mirror, as the shot moves down, down,
tdown to find William.  He is so much younger, without a zit in
tsight.  Puberty is so very distant on his horizon.

<b>t8tINT. DANCE -- NIGHT -- UNDER-CRANKEDtttt 8
</b>
tSong continues as we see William's perspective of these much-
tolder looking kids.  Girls now are visible, and they are even
tmore mature than the boys we've just seen.  They flirt and
tglow, arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys.
tWhispering in each other's ears, none of them looking down.
tIt's a troubling experience, to be this close to the alluring
tworld of older teenagers... and to be so invisible to them.

<b>tttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>tttAre you <i>really</i> in our grade?

<b>t9tINT. JUNIOR HIGH LOCKER ROOM -- DAYtttt  9
</b>
<b>tttttVOICE
</b>tttt(louder)
tttAre you really in our grade?

tWilliam turns to see tall, adenoidal TIM TOBIN.  The most mature
tlooking kid we've seen yet, he challenges William in a loud
ttheatrical tone.  It is a voice right out of <i>Guys and Dolls,</i>
twhich incidentally is the school play in which Tobin had just
tstarred.  William answers in a respectful voice.  He is
tdesperate for acceptance.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttYeah.

<b>tttttTOBIN
</b>tttHey guys!  Check it out!  William
tttdoesn't have any <i>pubes</i>!

tOthers now begin to gather around, examining William.  He has
tnever been more naked.

<b>tttttGUY # 1
</b>tttHow old are you man?

<b>tttttTOBIN
</b>tttHe's not a man, he's a little baby
tttkid.  He Doesn't even get zits yet.

<b>tttttGUY # 2
</b>tttHow come you don't have any hair down
tttthere?

<b>tttttTOBIN
</b>tttt(in loud, funny voice)
ttt<i>Where are your pubes???!!</i>

tTheir voices echo off the tiled walls.  Now everyone is watching
tthe hairless William.  He is confused by their meanness.

<b>tttttGUY # 2
</b>tttYeah.  Where are your <i>pubes?</i>

tAll eyes are on him, waiting for a response.  The kid's mental
twheels turn frantically.  And from somewhere comes an attitude,
ta swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could
tonly be a merciful deity.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(cool, dismissive)
tttI had 'em.  <i>I shaved 'em off.</i>

tIt is a new persona for the kid -- the witty guy.  And it works.
tGuy #2 cracks up, then others.  William's new accuser is
tsuddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these
tolder boys.  Others turn away, on to other things.  Tobin stares
tat William, and then also turns away.

<b>t10    INT. FAMILY CAR -- DAYtttttt10
</b>
tWilliam jumps into the backseat of the white Ford Country Sedan
tstation wagon, carrying books.  ("See ya pubes!")  Mom continues
tdriving William and Anita home from school.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(cheerfully, by rote, to
tttWilliam in back)
tttPut on your seatbelt.   I don't want
tttyou flying through the windshield.

tAnita examines her own un-fastened seatbelt, which Mom hasn't
tnoticed.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttWe got our annuals today --

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(cheerful, automatic)
ttt"Received" your annual.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(looking at his photo)
tttI look so much <i>younger</i> than everyone
tttelse.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttEnjoy it while you can.

tCamera drifts from Mom to Anita, who can take it no longer.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttMom.  It's <i>time.</i>

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(pleasant, pointed)
tttCan this wait until we get home?

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttMom, <i>pull over.</i>  Tell him the truth.
ttt<i>Tell him how old he is.</i>

tMom pulls over, and stares straight ahead with deep irritation.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(as in "be quiet")
tttHe <i>knows</i> how old he is.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttThe other kids make fun of him because
tttof How young he looks.  Nobody <i>includes</i>
ttthim.

tThey call him "The Narc" behind his back...

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttThey do?

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttWhat's a "Narc?"

<b>tttttANITA
</b>ttt(bleeding for her brother)
ttt<i>A Narcotics Officer!</i>

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>ttt<i>Well what's wrong with that?</i>

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(ever the peacemaker)
tttCome on you guys.  It's no big deal.
tttI'm 12.  It's okay. She skipped me a
tttgrade, it's okay.  Big deal.   I'm a
tttyear younger.  They're 13, I'm 12 --
tttt(beat)
tttAren't I?

tTheir silence is eloquent.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(confessing, in a rush)
tttI also put you in first grade when you
tttwere five and never told you.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(trembling)
tttSo...  I'm... how old?

tA heavy quiet.  She and his sister ignore him, as they now
tdebate the subject with each other.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttYou lied to him!  You make such a big
tttdeal about the truth and you lied!

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(that one hurts)
tttHe never asked.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttWhat -- like he's going to ask if he's
tttas old as he <i>thinks</i> he is?  Don't you
tttrealize, this is going to scar him
ttt<i>forever?</i>

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttHoney... sweetheart... don't be
tttCleopatra.  We have to be his mother
ttt<i>and</i> his Dad.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttYou put too much pressure on him!

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(apprehensive)
tttHow... old...

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttAnd when he rebels in some strange and
tttodd way, don't blame me.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>ttt... am I?

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(matter of fact)
tttI skipped you an extra grade.  You're
ttteleven.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>ttt(horrified, voice crackling)
ttt<i>ELEVEN?</i>

tHe looks at his body, the information affects him physically.
tNew sounds come from way down deep inside.  Mom now begins
tspeed-rapping, trying to stem the leak.  She starts the car.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttSo you skipped fifth grade.  There's
ttttoo  much padding In the grades.  I
ttttaught elementary school.  5th grade -
tttunnecessary.  Nothing happens in the
ttt5th grade.  All Teachers know it, no
tttone talks about it.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(still in shock)
tttE - <i>leven.</i>

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttAnd you skipped kindergarten because I
ttttaught it to you when you were four.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>ttt(still horrified, looking
ttt at his body)
tttThis explains... so much...

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttYou've robbed him of an adolescence!

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttAdolescence is a marketing tool.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttHe's got no "crowd"... no friends...

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttOkay!

tAnita reaches out to her brother.  With the compassion of a
tsaint, she offers this:

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttHoney, I know you were expecting
tttpuberty.  You're just going to have to
tttshine it on for a while.

tDeeply embarrassed, William shrinks down in the seat.  Mom
tmonitors his face constantly.  She is raw and sincere... and
tyes, inspiring:

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttWho needs a "crowd?"  You're unique.  You're
ttttwo years ahead of everybody.  Take those
tttextra years and do what you want.  Go to
tttEurope for a year!  Take a look around,
tttsee what you like!  Follow your dream!
tttYou'll <i>still</i> be the youngest lawyer in the
tttcountry.  Your own great grandfather
tttpracticed law until he was 93.  Your dad
tttwas so proud of you.  He knew you were a
ttt<i>pronominally accelerated child.</i>

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttWhat about me?

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(heartbroken, can't help
tttherself)
tttYou're rebellious and ungrateful of my
tttlove.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttWell, somebody's gotta be normal around
ttthere!

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(blinking, still can't
tttbelieve it)
ttt<i>Eleven.</i>

<b>t11    INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- DAYttttt11
</b>
tWilliam finishes the last of many candy bars.  A mound of
twrappers sit just below the mirror.  He examines his face
thopefully for zits.  Nothing coming.  We begin to hear Simon
tand Garfunkel's "America."

<b>t12    INT. LIVING ROOM - DAYtttttt12
</b>
tAnita stands in the living room.   The song continues playing
ton the stereo.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttI want to play you a song that explains
tttwhy I'm leaving, and try to listen.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttWe can't talk?  We have to listen to
tttrock music?

<b>t13    EXT. FRONT LAWN -- DAYtttttt13
</b>
tWilliam watches sadly.  Anita's good-looking boyfriend DARRYL,
ta dead ringer for young Stephen Stills, loads her suitcases
tinto a large turqouise Chevy.  The suitcases are adorned with
tplastic stick-on flowers.    All coolness is leaving William's
tlife.  Mom watches nearby, worried and helpless.   (Their house
tis more austere, less "fun" than the other front lawns.)

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttTake good care of her in San Francisco,
tttman.

tDarryl gives the kid a sub-human look.  He's invisible, too
tyoung to converse with.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttHow can she leave such a loving family?

tAnita turns and heads towards them.  She focuses on William,
tplacing her hands on his young shoulders.  Her face is very
tclose to him now, as she delivers this sage prediction of the
tfuture.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttOne day you'll be cool.

tHe nods stoically, hopefully.  He is utterly lost.  She leans
tforward and whispers in his ear.

tttttANITA (cont'd)
tttLook under your bed.  It'll set you
tttfree.

tAnita shakes hands with Mom, and exits.  As the car takes off:

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttShe'll be back.

tIn the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter.

<b>tttttANITA
</b><b>tttYEAHHHHH-HOOOOOOOO.
</b>
<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttMaybe not soon...

tWilliam watches wistfully.  He moves away from his mother.
tShe pulls him closer.  Shot moves in on his slightly fearful
tface.

<b>t14    INT. DARRYL'S CAR - DAYtttttt14
</b>
tAnita looks back at the receding American Gothic-image of her
tmother and brother.  Sister waves to brother.  She feels for
thim.  Music now shifts to The Who's "Sparks."

<b>t15    INT. BEDROOOM -- NIGHTtttttt15
</b>
tWilliam locks the door.  He reaches under his bed.  It's a
tblack leatherette travel bag, with tartan design.  He unzips
tthe bag -- it's filled with albums.  He flips through the
tamazing, subversive cache of music.  Cream's <i>Wheels of Fire...</i>
tthe seminal Bob Dylan bootleg <i>Great White Wonder...</i> the Rolling
tStones' <i>Get Yer Ya Ya's Out...</i> The Beach Boys' <i>Pet Sounds...</i>
t<i>Abraxas</i> by Santana... Jethro Tull's <i>Stand Up...</i> The Mother's of
tInvention's <i>We're Only In It For The Money...  Led Zeppelin...
tCrosby, Stills and Nash...</i> Miles Davis' <i>Bitches Brew...</i> and
tThe Who's <i>Tommy...</i> with a note taped to it.

<b>tttttANITA (V.O.)
</b>ttt"Listen to <i>Tommy</i> with a candle burning
tttand you will see your entire future..."

tThe heady effect of all these albums registers, as we see him
tlighting a candle.

<b>tTITLE:  1973
</b>
<b>tDETAIL SHOT OF NOTEBOOK
</b>
tA blue school notebook, with ballpoint pen renderings of the
tnames of groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin, complete with
tcarefully drawn thunderbolts.  Also, the name LESTER BANGS.

<b>t16    INT. JOURNALISM CLASS -- DAYttttt16
</b>
tWilliam, now 15, sits in class with book, <i>Adventures in
tJournalism.</i>  His hair is shoulder-length.  A dedicated teacher,
tPATRICIA DEEGAN, walks the aisles.  Music continues.

<b>t17    EXT. FOOD MACHINES - DAYtttttt17
</b>
tWilliam presses the food machine button, pulls an orange from
ta vending container.  He still looks younger than most of the
tstudents... and these days, especially the girls.

<b>t18    EXT. LUNCH COURT -- DAYtttttt18
</b>
tWilliam sits apart from all the others, under a tree.  He reads
tintently, happily, as he eats the orange.  It's a copy of <i>Creem</i>
tMagazine.  Music continues.

<b>tCLOSE ON PHOTOS IN MAGAZINE
</b>
tCamera moves across the photos, catching the expressions and
tfashions of the rock heroes of the day.  Ian Anderson of Jethro
tTull, eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute.  Neil Young,
tenigmatic with perfectly patched Levis.  The Southern Rock Royalty
tof The Allman Brothers Band, posing and laughing in front of
tmassive stacks of amps.  Marc Bolan of T. Rex, his ringlet-hair
tbacklit by stage lights.  David Bowie in skin-tight Japanese one-
tpiece attire, onstage with The Spiders From Mars.  Pete Townsend
tof the Who, slashing windmill-style at his guitar.

tDrift down to a by-line - <i>by Lester Bangs.</i>

<b>t19    EXT. PARKING LOT - DAYtttttt19
</b>
tWilliam walks through the parking lot after school.  Everybody
tnow congregates around the new arrival of their lives - their
town cars.  Arms suddenly clap William on the back, friendly
tfaces smile strangely, laughing.  He takes a few steps and
tlooks up to see... a school official is hurriedly removing
tsomething from the high-school marquee.

<b>tHIGH-SCHOOL MARQUEE
</b>
twhich reads: WILLIAM MILLER IS TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE (OR FUCK)

tAll are laughing.  He laughs with them, and turns as his face
tgoes slack.  He shrugs, marches on.

<b>t20    EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO RADIO STATION -- DAYttt20
</b>
tThe song we've been listening to is ripped off the turntable by
ta highly-active man in a red promotional t-shirt proclaiming the
tgreatness of The Guess Who.  He is a ferocious, lumbering, music-
tdriven presence, and he fills this small radio studio to the
tvery brim.  This is LESTER BANGS, 25, the rarely-seen God of a
tthen new art-form -- Rock Journalism.  A Disc-jockey with long-
tlong hair watches helplessly.  William views all this through a
tglass window.  He stands on the corner of a downtown side
tstreet, halfway up a steep incline.  He is the only person on
tthe streets this early Saturday morning.  Reveal that he is
twatching a live radio show, audible to us through the small
tp.a. speaker overhead.

<b>tttttDISC-JOCKEY

tttfor a few days -- Lester Bangs.

<b>tttttLESTER BANGS
</b>tttWhat is this hippie station?!  Where's
tttIggy Pop?  Don't you have a copy of
ttt<i>Raw Power?!</i>

<b>tttttDISC-JOCKEY
</b>tttLester, isn't it a little early for
tttthis?

tBangs searches for the album -- vinyl flying everywhere now,
twith no regard for album jackets.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttFound it!!

<b>t21    EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAYtttttt21
</b>
tWilliam watches intently.  Bangs thuds the needle onto a copy
tof <i>Raw Power.</i>   We're rewarded with a blast of Iggy and the
tStooges' "Search and Destroy."   A closer shot on William now
twatching the whirlwind of anarchy inside.  Lester does an Iggy
tPop impression, acting out a story for the d.j. that we cannot
thear, never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the
tother side of this double-glass window.

<b>t22    EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY -- LATERtttt22
</b>
tBangs walks with William on this sharply inclined San Diego
tstreet.  It's early, the streets are silent.  Bangs is about
tfifteen beer pounds overweight.  His jeans are loose, his
tpaleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and
tnights spent writing.  In there somewhere is a good-looking
tguy.  His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he
ttakes big sweeping steps.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttSo you're the one who's been sending
tttme those articles from your school
tttnewspaper -

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI've been doing some stuff for a local
tttunderground paper, too.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttWhat are you like the star of your
tttschool?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttThey hate me.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttYou'll meet them all again on their
tttlong journey to the middle.

tThe kid nods, they walk.

tttttBANGS (cont'd)
tttWell, your writing is damn good.  It's
tttjust a shame you missed out on rock
tttand roll.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI did?

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttOh yeah.  It's over.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttOver?

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttOver.  You got here just in time for
tttthe death rattle, the last gasp, the
tttlast <i>grope.</i>

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttWell.  At least I'm here for that.

tBangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head.  It's
ttoo late for newcomers.  But if the kid's age is an issue, he
tdoesn't mention it.  Like a machine-gun:

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttWhat do you type on?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttSmith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttYou like the new Lou Reed?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(automatic)
tttThe early stuff.  The new stuff, he's
ttttrying to be Bowie, he should be
ttthimself.  I'm not a big Lou man.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttYeah, but if Bowie's doing Lou, and
tttLou's Doing Bowie, Lou's still doing
tttLou.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(standing his ground)
ttt<i>If</i> you like Lou.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttTake drugs?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttNo.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttSmart kid.  I used to do speed and
tttsometimes Nyquil and stay up all night
tttwriting and writing, like 25 pages of
tttdribble about, you know, the Guess
tttWho, or Coltrane, <i>just to write,</i> you
tttknow, with the music blasting...

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>ttt<i>Me too.</i>  The writing part...

tFor a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest
tthing happens.  Bangs laughs.  It's an odd and charming laugh,
tthe kind a tough guy keeps well-hidden.  It surprised the kid,
twho smiles back.  Bangs stops at the corner, and offers a
tpleasant but very final nod of the head.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttWell, alright.  It's been nice to meet
tttyou.  I'll see you around.  Keep sending
tttme your stuff.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttOkay.  See you.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttI can't stand here all day talking to
tttmy many fans.

<b>tWIDE SHOT - SOLITUDE
</b>
tBut neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning.
tThey stand for a beat, hands in pockets, on this deserted
tstreet.  They are alone together, there's nobody else in sight.

<b>t23    INT. DINER -- DAYttttttt23
</b>
tWilliam listens intently as Lester eat a sandwich.  His face
tis an open book filling with words.

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>ttt-- so anyway, you're from San Diego
tttand <i>that's good.</i>  Because once you go
tttto L.A., you're gonna have friends
tttlike crazy but they'll be <i>fake friends,</i>
tttthey're gonna try to <i>corrupt</i> you.  The
tttpublicists!  The bands!  You got an
ttthonest face, they're gonna tell you
ttt<i>everything.</i>  But you CANNOT make friends
tttwith the rock stars.

tThe kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures --
t<i>can I make a note?</i>  Bangs nods.

tttttBANGS (cont'd)
ttt<i>Cannot</i> make friends with the rock stars.
tttt(savage bite)
tttThat's what's important.  If you're a rock
tttjournalist, a true journalist -- first you
tttwill never get paid much.  But you <i>will</i>
tttget free records from the record company.

tThe kid's eyes widen.  Bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal
twriting style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate
tsoftie.

tttttBANGS (cont'd)
tttAnd they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet
tttgirls... they'll try to fly you places for
tttfree.... offer you drugs...  I know.  It
tttsounds great.  But <i>they are not your
tttfriends.</i>   These are people who want you
tttto write sanctimonious stories about the
tttgenius of the rock stars and they will
ttt<i>ruin rock and roll</i> and strangle everything
tttwe love about it.

tPrivately, William thrills.  <i>We.  Our.</i>  It all sounds great to
thim.  He listens to the grouping of the words, every one of
tthem.  He madly scribbles.

tttttBANGS (cont'd)
tttThey are trying to <i>buy respectability</i>
tttfor a form that is <i>gloriously and
tttrighteously -</i>

tThe kid leans forward as Lester finds the right word.

tttttBANGS (cont'd)
ttt- <i>dumb!</i>  And you're smart enough to
tttknow that.  And the day it ceases to
tttbe dumb is the day it ceases to be
ttt<i>real.</i>  Right?  And then it will just
tttBecome an <i>Industry of Cool.</i>

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>ttt... Industry... of... cool...

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttAnd <i>that's what they want!</i>  And it's
ttthappening right now.  I'm telling you,
tttyou're coming along at a very dangerous
ttttime for rock and roll.  The war is
tttover.  They won.  99% of what passes
tttfor rock now... SILENCE is much more
tttcompelling.  It's over.  I think you
tttshould turn around and go back and
tttbe... a lawyer or something... but I
tttcan see from your face that you won't.
tttI can pay you thirty-five bucks.  Gimme
ttta thousand words on Black Sabbath.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(attempting cool)
tttAn assignment.

<b>tttttLESTER
</b>tttYeah.  And you should build your
tttreputation on being honest... and
ttt<i>unmerciful.</i>

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(writing in notebook)
tttHonest... <i>unmerciful...</i>

<b>tttttBANGS
</b>tttAnd if you get into a jam -- call me.
tttI stay up late.

tBangs reaches across the table, and William watches as he
tscribbles his number on the back of the kid's green collegiate
tnotebook.  The notebook has just become valuable.  They sit
ttogether, listening to the beautiful and compelling silence.

<b>t24    INT. FAMILY CAR -- NIGHTtttttt24
</b>
tMom drives William to the San Diego Sports Arena.  She looks
tout the window at the adrenalized concert-goers.  She feels
tprotective not just of her son, but an entire generation.
tWilliam goes over his questions for Black Sabbath.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttLook at this.  An entire generation of
tttCinderellas and <i>there's no slipper
tttcoming.</i>

tWilliam looks out the window at the sign: TONIGHT - SOLD OUT -
tBLACK SABBATH with special guest Stillwater.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttYou can drop me off here.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttBlack.  Sabbath.  Just remember - you
tttwanted to be Atticus Finch in <i>To Kill
ttta Mockingbird.</i>

tThe kid doesn't answer.  He silently goes over his questions.

tttttELAINE (cont'd)
tttAs long as I know this is just a hobby,
tttI'll go along with it.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttAll I have to do is <i>listen.</i>  That's
tttwhat Lester Bangs said.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(dryly)
tttI'll be waiting right here at eleven
ttt'o clock sharp.  If you get lost, use
tttthe family whistle.

tHe unhooks his seatbelt, stuffs his questions into an orange
tcanvas shoulder-bag and exits.

tElaine watches her son disappearing into the stony rock-concert
tcrowd.  It's a windy night.  Everything about this image
ttroubles her.  She fights with herself, and then uses the family
twhistle immediately.  He turns.

tttttELAINE (cont'd)
tttt(sweetly, too loud)
ttt<i>Don't take drugs!!</i>

tFifteen concert-goers turn around instinctively, at the sound
tof a Mother, and then identify William as the object of her
tconcern.  All around him, we hear:

<b>tttttHAPPY CONCERT GOERS
</b>ttt<i>Don't take drugs!!</i>

tHe winces, nods and moves forward.  Music echoes from the open
twindows of many other cars.

<b>t25    EXT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA BACKSTAGE RAMP -- NIGHTtt 25
</b>
tThe kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel
tbackstage arena door.  He rings the buzzer.  The door wheezes
topen to reveal the keeper of the San Diego Sports Arena's
tbackstage list.  Famous to all those who attempt to enter,
tthis is SCOTTY.  He is a wiry, humorless man for whom
tpowerlessness is the theme of his life -- except for those few
thours he controls the list.  Scotty is only forty but everything
tabout him screams that he's an angry sixty.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttHi.  I'm William Miller and I'm here
tttfrom <i>Creem</i> Magazine to interview the
tttband Black Sabbath.

tScotty, immediately suspicious, moves to a nearby podium and
tsnaps through three clipboard pages.  He moves back to the
tdoor and grabs the handle.

<b>tttttSCOTTY
</b>tttNot on the list.

tHe shuts the door with finality.  The kid stands silently for
ta moment.  He looks over his shoulder, at two chattering
tGroupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp.  They
tlook at him sympathetically, but he turns away.  William rings
tthe buzzer again, withdrawing a copy of <i>Creem</i> from his bag.
tThe door opens.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttSir, I'm a journalist, and here's a
tttcopy of the magazine.

tThe magazine hangs in mid-air.

<b>tttttSCOTTY
</b>tttYou're <i>not on the list.</i>   Go to the
ttttop of the ramp with the girls!

tSlam.  William stands there for a moment.  Unsure of what to
tdo next, he looks back to the top of the ramp.  Rejected by
thim just moments earlier, the groupies now feign disinterest.
tBracing himself, William rings again.  The door opens slowly
tthis time.  Scotty stands peering at him.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(in a rush)
ttt<i>What-happens-after-I-go-to-the-top-of-
tttthe-ramp with-the-gi -</i>

tSlam.  Lock.

<b>t26    EXT. TOP OF SPORTS ARENA RAMP -- NIGHTtttt26
</b>
tWilliam inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the
tramp.  The wind whips.  It's just him, and two Groupies in
ttheir evening best.  They now pretend to barely notice the
tyoung journalist who has been banished to stand with them.
tChattering excitedly, with sophistication far beyond her 17
tyears, is ESTRELLA.  She sports long unruly black hair.  Her
tpartner hangs in the shadows, adjusting shoes.  Estrella turns
tto the kid with great disinterest.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttWho are <i>you</i> with?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(embarrassed to be alive)
tttMe?  I'm with myself.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttNo, who are you <i>with?</i>  What <i>band?</i>

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
tttt(beat)
tttI'm a journalist.  I'm not a... you
tttknow...

tEstrella stares at him.  Moving into the parking lot light,
tintroducing herself, is a luminous girl in a green faux-fur
ttrimmed coat.  This is PENNY LANE.  There is an inviting warmth
tand real interest in the way she asks:

<b>tttttPENNY LANE
</b>ttt... you're not a <i>what?</i>

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(enthralled)
tttOh... I'm just... not a... you know.

<b>tttttPENNY LANE
</b>tttNot a "what"?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(charmed)
tttYou know.  A "groupie."

tThe two girls are deeply insulted by the word.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttOhhh!

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttSorry, I -

<b>tttttPENNY LANE
</b>tttWe.  Are not.  "Groupies."

tEstrella indicates Penny with great reverence.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttThis is <i>Penny Lane,</i> man.  Show some
ttt<i>respect.</i>

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>ttt-- sorry.

tPenny steps closer, focusing completely on the kid.  Behind
ther, concert-goers throw a few woo-woos their way.  She seems
tnot to hear them.

<b>tttttPENNY LANE
</b>ttt"Groupies" sleep with rock stars because
tttthey want to be near someone famous.
tttWe are here because of the <i>music.</i>  We
tttare <i>Band Aids.</i>

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttShe used to run a school for Band Aids.

<b>tttttPENNY LANE
</b>tttWe don't have <i>intercourse</i> with these
tttguys.  We support the <i>music.</i>  We <i>inspire</i>
tttthe <i>music.</i>  <i>We are here because of the
tttmusic.</i>

tWilliam is nodding like a doll in a dashboard window.
tListening.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttMarc Bolan broke her heart, man.  It's
tttfamous.

<b>tttttPENNY LANE
</b>tttIt's a long story.  I'm retired now.
tttI'm just visiting friends.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>ttt<i>She</i> was the one who changed everything.
ttt<i>She</i> said "no more sex, no more
tttexploiting our bodies and hearts... "

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttRight.  Right.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>ttt"... just blow-jobs, and <i>that's it.</i>"

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttOkay.  Well, see, now I get the
tttdifference.

tShot drifts off him and picks up, out of the darkness, another
tbreathless girl teetering on tall shoes.  She is in the vicinity
tof 16.  Her black hair is cropped short and died red, just
tlike the cover of Bowie's <i>Aladdin Sane.</i>  She is POLEXIA, the
tvoluptuous one, from Riverside.

<b>tttttPOLEXIA
</b>tttt(the usual greeting)
tttIt's all happening.  It's all happening.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttPolexia!!   Did you tell Sabbath we
tttwere going to be here?

<b>tttttPOLEXIA
</b>tttI talked to Dick with Stillwater, I
ttttalked with Sabbath.  They're all dying
tttto see us.   It's all happening.

<b>tttttPENNY LANE
</b>tttThis is our journalist friend.
tttJournalist Friend, meet Estrella Starr,
tttand Polexia Aphrodisia. And you are --

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttWilliam.

tSilent beat.  His name lands like a thud.

<b>tttttPOLEXIA
</b>tttHere comes Sabbath!

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttOzzy!!!  Tony!!!  It's us!!

tA long black limo with darkened windows swishes past, beeps
ttwice.  The metal backstage gate rises and the limo rolls
tinside.  And then silence again.  The girls do not discuss
tbeing rebuffed.

tttttESTRELLA (cont'd)
tttI think I saw Sapphire in there.

<b>tttttPOLEXIA
</b>tttt(can't hold it in any longer)
tttOkay.  I was with Ian Hunter <i>all night</i>
tttat Rodney's Last night.  Wanna see his
tttspoo?  I saved it in a baggie.

tShe opens her purse and shows the girls something inside.
tWilliam edges away.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttt(peering into purse)
tttI'm really happy he's doing so well.

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttt(regarding what's in purse)
tttYeah.  I know he's such a talented
tttguy.  I mean, look at him.  Who deserves
tttit more?

<b>tttttPOLEXIA
</b>tttt(looking in purse)
tttNobody -- he's so sweet.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttt(with compassion)
tttDon't you just <i>root for him,</i> you know.
tttTo go <i>that little distance</i> between
tttgood and great?

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttWait.  That's not his.  I would know
ttthis.

tA very odd look on his face, William now cranes for a discreet
tlook.  <i>What's in that purse?</i>

<b>tBAM -- THE BACKSTAGE DOOR OPENS
</b>
tOut steps SAPPHIRE, 19, a tall girl with taller platforms.  Heavy
teye-makeup.  Her accent is Texan, with odd traces of English.
tIn one hand is a half-drained bottle of champagne.  In the other,
ta fistful of backstage passes.

<b>tttttSAPPHIRE
</b>ttt<i>Does anybody remember laugh-tah?</i>
tttt(as they turn)
ttt<i>Come and GET 'EM!</i>

tThe girls scream and happily head down the ramp to Sapphire.
tPenny looks back and grabs William with a well-placed arm hooked
taround his.  He joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the
tramp.  Sapphire slaps passes on the girls.  As Scotty (The
tKeeper  of the Backstage List) watches, Penny now slips William
tforward for a pass.

<b>tttttSCOTTY
</b>tttOh no.  Not this one --

<b>tttttSAPPHIRE
</b>tttt(off William)
tttWho brought <i>Opie?</i>

tThe kid looks over his shoulder.  Who's <i>Opie?</i>

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttHe's with us.

<b>tttttSCOTTY
</b>tttt(hand blocking William)
tttHe wasn't with you.

<b>tttttSAPPHIRE
</b>tttt(to Scotty)
tttAre you going to turn this into a
ttt<i>Thing?</i>

<b>tttttSCOTTY
</b>tttAll of you can wait outside!  Top of
tttthe ramp!

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI don't want to cause a Thing.  I'll
tttwait.

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttt(privately, to William)
tttI'll go take care of this.

tSadly, they leave him behind.  The thundering arena sound of
tthe collecting crowd, the p.a. system blasting Yes'
t"Roundabout"... purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases...
tthe glimpse of backstage rock and roll... everything he wants
tto be a part of is on the other side of this door.  And then
tit shuts.  He stands alone.

tAt the top of the ramp, a tour bus unloads.  It reads --
tSTILLWATER TOUR 73.  Moving loudly out of the bus is the opening
tband.  This is Stillwater.  Four road-weary band members, and
ttheir road manager.  Voices booming.

tRUSSELL HAMMOND, 27, presses the buzzer with the nose of his
tguitar-case.  It's obvious from moment one.  This is the star
tof the band, the charismatic one.  He's tired.  They're late.
tWilliam recognizes him instantly, as the guitarist stretches.
tThe buzzer goes unanswered.  The kid is invisible to him, as
tthe others now arrive behind Russell.

tTour/band manager DICK ROSWELL, 27, follows, loudly banging on
tthe steel door.  He has the flaxen-haired look of a former
thippie, but he carries the emblem of a real pro -- the newest
tsilver Halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes.
tHis direction is always - forward.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttLet us in, we're Stillwater!  We're on
tttthe show!!

tWilliam is surrounded by them now.  They stand together under the
tsingle lightbulb, familiar faces, a live-action album cover.  JEFF
tBEBE the singer, his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his
thead.  ED VALLENCOURT the quiet drummer, his long arms hanging
tlimply at his sides.  His is a face made for the background. LARRY
tTURNER the compact bass-player.   Dick now kicks at the door with
this foot, as William produces a copy of <i>Creem</i> Magazine.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(to Dick)
tttHi, I'm a journalist.  I write for <i>Creem</i>
tttMagazine.

tOnce again, the magazine hangs there.  He can't <i>give</i> it away.

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttThe enemy!  A rock writer!

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(struggling forward)
tttI'd like to interview you or someone
tttfrom the band.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttt(busy, running behind)
tttI'm sorry but could you please <i>fuck
tttoff?</i>

tWilliam blinks a little, takes it in stride.  Russell sizes
thim up, moving in the background.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttOkay.  Okay.  I could do that.

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttYou guys <i>never</i> listened to our records.
tttYou're all just frustrated musicians.
tttDo you know what your magazine SAID
tttabout us?  What was it - "the singer's
tttincessant cater walling distracts From
tttan assault with no clear purpose."

<b>tttttLARRY
</b>tttt(in background)
tttThat was <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttYeah.  Okay.  Fuck off anyway.  We
tttplay for fans, not critics.

tStung, William shrugs.  It's been a terrible night, but at
tleast thrillingly so.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttRussell.  Jeff.  Ed.   Larry.
tttt(can't help it)
tttI really love your band.   I think the
tttsong "Fever Dog" is a big step forward
tttfor you guys.  I think you guys
tttproducing it yourselves, instead of
tttGlyn Johns, was the right thing to do.
tttAnd the guitar sound was <i>incendiary.</i>
tttt(gestures with fist)
tttWay to go.

tHe turns and leaves, beginning his long trek back up the ramp.
tRussell looks at the others.  That kind of love is hard to
tgive up.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttt(good humored, yelling)
tttWell don't stop <i>there.</i>

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttYeah, come back here!!  Keep going!

tThey wave him back, as the backstage door opens again.  The
tkid moves back down the ramp.   They herd him in with them,
tthrough the door.  Scotty quickly spots the kid and squares
toff.

tRussell notes the kid's swirling emotional state, shoves him
tforward.

<b>tttttSCOTTY
</b>tttNot this one.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttHe's with us.

<b>tttttSCOTTY
</b>ttt<i>He's not with you.</i>  He's not with <i>them.</i>
tttHe's not on the <i>list.</i>  <i>He's not coming
tttin.</i>  And this is my arena.  And
tttfurthermore -

tRussel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to
tScotty.

tttttSCOTTY (cont'd)
ttt- have a good time tonight.   Welcome
tttto San Diego.

<b>t27    INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY -- NIGHTttttt27
</b>
tThe band moves quickly down the hallway, with William moving
tto keep up.  A young and grizzled red-haired roadie, RED DOG,
tcatches them on the way.  The band swarms around him.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttRed Dog!

<b>tttttRED DOG
</b>tttWe're playing here tomorrow night.

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttt(aside, to the kid)
tttThis is Red Dog, the Allman Brothers
tttBand's number one roadie.

tRussel clamps an arm around Red Dog's neck.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttHow're the guys?

<b>tttttRED DOG
</b>tttHavin a ball, man.  When we have a
tttparty, we have an <i>Allman Brothers Band</i>
tttparty.  Everybody boogies.  Everybody
tttgets off.  It's family, man.  We all got
tttThese now.
tttt(flashes new mushroom tattoo
ttton forearm)
tttWe'll see you guys in Boston, right?
tttt(specifically to Russell)
tttDicky and Gregg send you their love.

tCamera catches flash of envy on the face of Jeff Bebe, as
tStillwater sweeps forward into a small dressing room.

<b>t28    INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHTttttt28
</b>
tDressing room activity swirls around him, as William simply
tlistens.  He holds a small microphone.  His stoic look gives away
tlittle of the full body rush he's experiencing.  As the other
tband members drift across frame, Russell Hammond, a true rock and
troll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready
tfor the show.  To the kid, every word is reckless gem.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>ttt... and it's <i>okay,</i> because rock and

tJeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm, and rubs it into
this scalp - poor man's mousse.

</b>ttt- but it's a voice that says <i>here I
tttam...</i> and FUCK YOU if you can't

tRussell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth
tfrom his guitar case.  The kid notices all these close-up
tdetails of rock.

tttttRUSSELL (cont'd)
tttAnd one of those people is gonna save the
tttworld and that means that ROCK AND ROLL
tttCAN SAVE THE WORLD -- all of us together.

tThe kid's eyes dance.  He checks to make sure he's getting the
trecording.  He listens intently.

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttAnd the chicks are great.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttBut we didn't do it for that!  We are
ttthere because we needed to fuckin be
ttthere, not just 'cause we needed to
tttaway from Troy, Michigan, WHICH WE

tttAll we get are these fucking old-ass
tttinterviewers who don't understand,

tttare here, which is the fuckin' BUZZ.

tWilliam nods, holds his microphone steady.  Russell tunes his
tguitar, ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks.
tJeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer.

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttThe next album will be even better.
tttMore texture.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttBut... it's not what you put in, is

tRussell's face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of
tmusic.

tttttRUSSELL (cont'd)
tttA song like "What's Going On."  That
tttsingle "woo" at the end of the second

ttt"woo."

tttThat's what you remember.  The silly

tWilliam nods, says nothing, keeps the microphone pointed.
tActivity surrounds him.

</b>tttt(impressed)
tttWe used to talk more about this stuff.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttOkay.  See, this is maybe the most

tRussell takes a last swig of beer.  A roadie whisks his guitar
taway.

tttttDICK (cont'd)
tttAll this luggage is going to L.A.!

tWilliam is swept out in the chaos of the pre-show ritual,
tpast the pile of luggage by the door.  It's a colorful heap of
tsuitcases, featuring colorful laminated band tags, each with a
tnumber.

<b>t29    INT. BACKSTAGE STEPS -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATERttt29

tWilliam sits on the backstage steps, writing feverishly in his

tinto place.

</b>tttI found you a pass.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(amped, distracted)
tttThanks.  I got in with Stillwater.

tWilliam nods, still scribbling.  She eases down into place on
tthe step next to him.  Her proximity cause him to look at

tfingers.

</b>tttIt's a long story.

</b>tttt(quick study)
tttRight.  Right.

tShe takes his backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his
tthigh - the cooler location.  Nearby, the dressing room door
topens, and the Stillwater exits.   Excitement level rises as
tthey mass in the hallway with instruments.  We hear the amped
tvoice of Russell growing nearer.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttThe Enemy!

tHe approaches, as William stands.  Penny watches, hanging out
tof Russell's eyesight.

tStanding in the supercharged hallway, the kid is anxious to
tintroduce his new friends.

tAnd do not let go, for too long.  There is history in their

t"Penny Lane."

tttt(noting kid's shyness)
tttBoth of you.

ton the ground just in front of them, guiding their way in the
tdark to the stage steps.

tRussell pulls William into the band's huddle.

<b>tSHOT LOOKING UP AT THEM
</b>
tTheir band ritual, psyching together, arms on each other's
tshoulders in a circle.  They sing a dew lines of the classic
t"Train Kept A-Rollin'" (or "Go See Cal" from the Cal Worthington
tad) They all touch feet, and then <i>break,</i> heading for the stage.
tRussell directs Penny to his side of the stage.  The kid follows.
tPlugging in, still in darkness, Russell hits a practice chord --
t<i>thwack.</i>  He steps on effects pedal.  Applause.  (Adlib onstage
tprivate patter, between members, goading each other -- the stuff
tno audience ever hears)  Twenty feet away, Dick prepares to
taddress the crowd from the darkened stage.  It is his favorite
tmoment of the evening, the highlight of his job.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttFrom Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome --
tttt(importantly)
ttt<i>Stillwater.</i>

tLight hits the stage, and the band launches into their opening
tsong, "If You Say Nothing."  Audience response is strong.
tShot lingers on the face of William as he soaks in the most
tundeniably exciting moment of any concert, the first thirty
tseconds.

tJeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some
tvocal pyrotechnics.  Russell looks over to Penny and William,
tat stage right, grinning, pretending to trip on his cord, an
telegant show-off move of a musician who is now where he
tbelongs... before seriously stepping forward for the first
tguitar lead of the night.  The kid looks over to see Penny
twatching Russell.

<b>t31    EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT -- LATERttttt31
</b>
tCases are shut and rolled toward the trucks.  Stillwater heads
tfor their bus.  Jeff the singer says goodbye to Estrella Starr,
tlike a sailor leaving port.   Russell lingers behind, saying
tgoodbye to William, loading his own equipment.  Black Sabbath
tpasses with entourage, heading to the stage.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttt(privately)
tttSo.  You want to come up to L.A., we'll
tttbe at the "Riot House" all week.

</b>tttThe Continental Hyatt House!  It's on

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(attempting cool)
tttRight.  Right.

tAll the while, just over the kid's shoulder, Russell scans the
tbackstage crowd of hangers-on.  Looking perhaps for Penny Lane.

</b>tttLet's blow this burg!

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttt(exiting)
tttWell tell your friend Miss Penny Lane

tttDo you know about the "Riot House?"

<b>tttttPENNY LANE

tShe smiles privately.

tttttWILLIAM (cont'd)
tttI got it.  No problem.  Long story.
tttAlright!  I gotta go.

tElsewhere in the arena, Black Sabbath is performing "Sweet
tLeaf."  The kid could care less.  He has bonded with Stillwater.
tHe heads for the door.  Penny walks with him.  He's loving it.
tThey pass a still-scowling Scotty, flashing passes, as they
texit out into the ramp area.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI think I live in a different world.

tThey stand in the night air.  The parking lot is largely silent
tnow, save for the thudding bass sounds of Black Sabbath.  In
tthe distance, we hear Elaine's insistent whistle.

tas he transcribes.

<b>tINT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

tThe work of a journalist, as William sits at his Smith-Corona

tMiss Penny Lane's yellow Vega makes the big swing onto Sunset
tBoulevard.  She sings along to the obscure words of Led

tpassenger seat.  Huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or
tbeer, but <i>albums.</i>  It's a wondrous piece of geography for any
trock fan.  Shot moves in as William, watches, takes it <i>all</i> in.
tHe moves his head outside the window to see fully.  Her

tnow wears her green faux-fur trimmed coat.  She grabs William's
thand, steadying her hat at the same time.  They dart across
tthe busy street.  She stumbles a little on her platforms.  He
tsteadies his taller date.  They are a good team as they pass

tPenny blasts into the Continental Hyatt House, William on her
tarm.  The lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive
tthan most clubs.  It's a swirling mass of Roadies carrying
tHalliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers, mingling
tRockers, and more than a few Groupies with lower-ambitions and
ttaller-platforms than Penny Lane.  The feeling is communal,
tillicit, intoxicating.  The secret community of rock.  Penny
tattracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades.

tand never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes.  Tonight he
twears a custom homemade t-shirt with iron-on block letters.
tIt features the four Led Zeppelin symbols and the words: "TO
tBE A ROCK AND NOT TO ROLL."  A felt-tip pen is still in his

<b>tttttPENNY LANE
</b>tttOkay.  Time to put on the lampshade.

tUp ahead, the door to their smallish hotel room is open.
tInside, a band party in full swing.  A clunky early-model boom
tbox segues from James Brown's "Make It Funky" to Led Zeppelin's
t"Gallows Pole."   Russell Hammond is the center of this party,
tjabbing out the chords, playing along on guitar.  Much singing
techoes all around.  It's a hotel-room Hootenanny, and all
tmembers of the band are present.  Penny Lane takes a breath
tand enters, with arms extended and pointing in opposite
tdirections.  She does a flawless stewardess imitation, with
tproper hand gestures, to a loud party ovation.

tThey all applaud her, laughing.  William watches her with

tJohn Bonham's drums thunder through the bus, everybody still
tsinging as they dip down into the city ahead, Phoenix.  William
twatches the living documentary around him.  He writes furiously
tin the green notebook, scribbling in the dark, trying to steady
this writing on the bumpy bus.  Behind him, someone is beating
talong to the song on his seat.  He never want to leave this world.

tpaisley scarf over the room lamp.  Polexia puts a towel along
tthe crack of the door, blows out the glowing embers on too-
tmany sticks of incense, and moves to the phone.  Estrella has
tjoined them as well, complete with a bag full of shoes.

tthe wadded pieces of paper, stuffs them in his pocket.  He
tleaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and
tmatches from the nearby maid's cart.  Then he returns to
tRussell's door.  He can't help but listen to the muffled sounds

tAs always, Russell sets the tone.  He's feeling good.
tStillwater takes over -- they feel mighty, like the Beetles,
tas they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold
trecords  and head down the small hallway to the control room
tinterview.  Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her
tgreen coat.  He tries to distance himself from her -- still a
tlittle stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will
thave none of it.  She privately shares every great passing
tmoment with him.  He tries not to succumb to these charms.
tIt's hard.  Music segues to Stillwater's own "Fever Dog."

tin this room.  Russell takes a seat near the open mike.  Jeff

tjust as close to the microphone as Russell.  William watches
tall as he sits at the dark back of this control booth.
tStillwater sits with late-night progressive disc-jockey QUINCE

tQuince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it.
tThe entire Stillwater band is now collected in the studio and
tready for the interview.   William can't avoid looking at Penny
tLane, who looks great tonight.  She catches him, and he barely
tlooks away in time.  Polexia, newly reconciled with Jeff,
tnotices.  The very mellow disc-jockey eases up to the

tDawn is breaking for William.

</b>tttYou know what I mean?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttRight.  Yeah.

</b>tttSee, you're dangerous.  Most people

ttt<i>listen.</i>

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttRight.  Right.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttSo your question you asked me.  I think
tttabout It every fucking night.  The
ttt"business."  I hate it!
tttt(quietly)
tttI grew up with these guys, okay?  I
tttcan't play all that I can play, I'm
ttt<i>past</i> these musicians, do you understand?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI do.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttThe more popular we get, the more I
tttcan't walk on them, the bigger their
ttthouses get, the more pressure... you
tttforget, man.  You forget what it was
tttlike to be real, to be a <i>fan.</i>  You can
ttthear it in a lot of bands who've been
tttsuccessful - it doesn't sound like
tttmusic anymore.  It sounds like...
tttlike <i>lifestyle maintenance.</i>
tttt(suddenly confessional)
tttI used to be able to hear the sounds
tttof the world.  Everything, to me, used
tttto sound like music.  Everything.  Now
tttI don't hear it.   You know what I'm
ttttrying to say?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(ruefully)
tttYeah.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttMan, it feels good to say this stuff
tttout loud.  But what am I doing?  I'm
ttttelling secrets to the <i>one</i> guy you
tttdon't tell secrets to.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(feeling included)
tttNo, that's okay.  We'll do the interview
ttttomorrow.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttThis is good.  So there's the "friend"
tttand then there's the "interview guy."

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttYeah.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttSo tonight it's "friend".... and when
tttwe wake up tomorrow - "<i>interview guy.</i>"
tttWe'll figure it out as we go, buddy.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttHey - for whatever it's worth - you
tttguys are really good.

tRussell laughs at the kid's easy naivete.  He hands his guitar
tto the kid, and joins the party.  William watches, part of the
tcrowd... somehow feeling a little compromised.  He doesn't
tcare.  Penny gestures for him to join them.

<b>t70    EXT. SUN STADIUM - AFTERNOONttttt70
</b>
tWilliam interviews Larry in the seats of the empty arena.  On
tstage, Ed soundchecks his drums.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttHow would you describe your role in
tttStillwater?  What is the chemical that
tttyou add to the chemistry?

<b>tttttLARRY
</b>tttI'm the bass-player.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttt(pressing for some poetry)
tttRight.  And when you take that away...
tttwhat would be missing?  Stylistically?
tttWhat <i>chemical?</i>

<b>tttttLARRY
</b>tttt(not getting it)
tttThe bass?

tLarry doesn't give him much.

<b>t71    EXT. SUN STADIUM - NIGHTtttttt 71
</b>
tIt's raining.  The pre-show huddle breaks up, William a part
tof them.  Penny Lane adjusts Larry's look.  She takes the scarf
tfrom around his neck and ties it around his leg.  He looks
tinstantly better.  William watches in the darkness as Dick
ttakes the microphone.  The best part of his day has arrived.
tIn his important voice:

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttGood evening Phoenix.
tttt(applause)
tttFrom Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome,
ttt<i>Stillwater.</i>

tLights come up, as the band launches into "Fever Dog."   Jeff
tbegins singing.  Russell reaches to adjust the microphone for
ta back-up vocal and is hit with something unexpected.

tA sharp electrical <i>shock.</i>

tIt's just a slight pop in the loud din of music, but within a
tmoment something is clearly wrong.  Russell holds onto the
tmicrophone stand with a surprised look, conducting high-voltage
tfor two seconds and then he <i>snaps</i> his hand off the metal.  His
tface is white, he takes off his guitar and walks off-stage,
tcollapsing a couple steps later.

<b>t72    EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHTtttttt72
</b>
tDick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus, which has
tbeen pulled up into the backstage area.   He guides a sagging
tRussell, assisted by Penny Lane, into the bus.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttGet in, get in!!

tWilliam boards the bus, as the extremely agitated PROMOTER
tarrives to confront Dick.

<b>tttttPROMOTER
</b>tttAre you the manager of this band?

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttThat, and more.  Get in!

<b>tttttPROMOTER
</b>tttYou didn't even play a full set!

tDick whirls and unleashes an anger we've not yet seen, gesturing
twith the silver briefcase that does not leave his hand.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttYour shoddy stage set-up almost killed
tttour guitarist!

<b>tttttPROMOTER
</b>tttYou trashed the dressing room - you
tttdidn't play your thirty-five minutes.

</b>
<b>tttttPROMOTER
</b>tttI hope you have a good lawyer.

tHe swings into the bus, as the bus revs.

<b>tttttPROMOTER
</b><b>tttLOCK THE GATE ON 'EM!
</b>
<b>t73    INT. BUS -- NIGHTttttttt73
</b>
tRussell sits, pale, next to Penny at the front of the bus.  He
texamines his singed hand, shaking it a little to emphasize the
tpositivity of her words.

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttDon't worry.  It's happened to all the
tttgreats.  Thank God you didn't hold the
tttmike stand with both hands, you'd still
tttbe holding it.  This is a good thing.
tttIt's a good, good, good thing.

tWilliam sits nearby, watching Russell, making notes out of eye-
tsight of others.  The ever-wary Jeff, unseen by William, cranes
tto see that he's writing in his notebook.

tDick swings into the seat across from Russell.  The bus door
tshuts, as the promoter is still yelling.

tDoris is slow to gain speed, as Estrella appears, running
talongside.  She knocks on the window next to William.

<b>tttttESTRELLA
</b>tttI forgot to tell you!  Your mom says
tttto call home immediately.  She says
ttt<i>she knows what's going on!</i>
tttt(receding)
tttSee you guys in Topeka!  I'll catch a
tttride with Sabbath!

tWilliam nods with embarrassment, waves to her, as the bus races
ttoward the now closing gate.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttt(casually, to Russell)
tttWanna buy a gate?

tBefore Russell can answer - BASH.  Doris barrels through the
tsteel-gate, snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside
tthis bus.

tttttDICK (cont'd)
tttYou just bought a gate.
tttt(to the bus)
tttC'mon Doris!!  Get us out of town!!

tThe bus struggles up a slight incline, everybody rooting for
tDoris, as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a
tthoroughfare.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttWhat did it feel like to be
tttelectrocuted?

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttIt burns.  It feels like a dose of
tttlead shooting through your body... and
tttthen you see God, and he says, "How
tttbad do you want to be legendary?" And
tttgod <i>damnit.</i>  I let go.
tttt(shaky grin as all laugh
tttwarmly)
tttRock and roll.

tJeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy.  The kid
tscribbles in his notebook.  We hear Led Zeppelin's "That's the
tWay."

<b>t74    INT. BUS - EARLY MORNINGtttttt74
</b>
tSong continues.  Almost everybody is asleep.  William takes
tthe camera and snaps a Polaroid of a sleeping Penny.  She wakes
tup.

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttGive that to me.

tShe grabs for it, they have a brief play-fight.  He grabs some
tother Polaroids from her pocket.  He hustles to the back of
tthe bus, pockets the photo, and settles down to watch the
tpassing landscapes.  She chases him down the aisle.  Music
tcontinues as she sits down next to him.  Out the window, a
tlong-distance running team of Girls keeps pace with the bus
tfor a bit.  They wave.  Penny watches them over sunglasses,
twaves briefly to the real world.

tttttPENNY (cont'd)
tttt(breathing heavy, owning
tttthe world)
tttWhen we go to Morocco, I think we should
tttwear completely different clothes, and
tttbe completely different people.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttWhat will our names be?

tShe snaps a Polaroid of a nearby sleeping Silent Ed, pockets
tthe Polaroid.  She regards Russell up ahead, also sleeping.
tHer attention has already wandered from Morocco.

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttWhat do you think of Russell?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI like him.

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttYou're coming to Cleveland, right?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>ttt<i>Cleveland, Ohio?</i>  Oh no no no.  I gotta
tttget my interview with Russell before
ttt<i>Greenville.</i>  And you've got to help
tttme.  Okay?  Friends... remember?

tPenny is still watching Russell.

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttYou should give him a break.  There
tttare real problems in the band.   Off
tttthe record.

tGravely noting the word "problems", the kid joins Penny in
twatching Russell, who is splayed haphazardly, sleeping
trestlessly up ahead.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttWhat problems?

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttOkay.  I got it.  I think your name
tttshould be Spencer, and mine will be
tttJane.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI can't keep up with you.

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttNo one can.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttWhat's your real name?

tShe looks at him briefly.  She puts her arm around him.  It's
tintoxicating, but he doesn't quite know how to act.  With her
tfree hand, she gestures with a hanger.  As they regard Russell
tsleeping nearby:

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttHere's the thing about Russell.  He's
tttmy last project.  I only do this for a
tttvery few people.  <i>And I think we should
tttdo it together</i> - he is almost great.
tttWe've got to take him there.  You and
tttme - we can do it.  Deal?  Because the
tttother guys are good - but he could be
tttgreat.  He's my last project.

tHe looks at her.  She imitates his face back to him.

tttttPENNY (cont'd)
tttIt's all happening.

<b>t75    INT. TOPEKA ARENA BACKSTAGE -- NIGHTtttt75
</b>
tWilliam sits interviewing Silent Ed by some equipment cases.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttWhat do you love about music?

tEd looks at him thoughtfully.  It is an eloquent moment.  He
tthinks.  He shrugs.  The kid tumbles with more questions.
tThese interviews are not going well.

<b>t76    INT. BATHROOM - NIGHTtttttt76
</b>
tWilliam, looking concerned over the state of his interviews,
twalks into the backstage bathroom.  He makes a few surreptitious
tnotes in his notebook before noticing that Jeff is standing
tthere, clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered
tby a Local Hanger-On.  Seeing the kid, he immediately hides
tthe coke spoon.

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttHey.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttHey.

tWilliam pretends he sees nothing as he turns to the urinal,
tand shot stays on Jeff, who looks a little high and a little
tworried.

<b>t77    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE - NIGHTttttt77

tin the background.

</b>
tWilliam on the phone.  Estrella leans on him, fixing her shoe.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttRight now -- Topeka.  Then Greenville.
tttThen home.

tHe winces slightly, holds the phone away from his ear for a
tmoment.

tttttWILLIAM (cont'd)
tttI'm sorry I didn't call yesterday!
tttIt's not like you can just <i>carry a
tttphone around with you.</i>

<b>t80    INT. ELAINE'S SCHOOL OFFICE -- AFTERNOONtttt80
</b>
tMom sits in her school office, a miniature version of her home
t- a fortress in which she is surrounded by books.  The sun is
tgoing down.  She can't resist a sentimental moment.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttI guess I just miss you, and I don't
tttunderstand why I've driven both my
tttkids so far away from me.  By all

tHe is touched by her vulnerability, more visible now than ever,
tas music continues in b.g.

tttttELAINE (cont'd)
tttWas I not fun?

<b>t81    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE -- NIGHTttttt81
</b>
tWilliam has his finger in his ear.  The din if Stillwater's
tset now blots out all other noise.  It is not the time to answer
tthis question.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttI missed the last thing you said.

tMom takes a pause.

<b>tttttELAINE

tPenny now enters, watching.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b><b>tttWHAT?
</b>
<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttt(angry, louder)
<b>tttI MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU!
</b>
tWilliam now notices Penny standing nearby, picking at a salad
tfrom a paper dish.  Looking at her, he lets loose with what he
tbelieves is a private confession.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b><b>tttI LOVE YOU!!
</b>
tPenny smiles knowingly, collecting his affection like another
tbackstage pass, and turns away.  Camera stays on William.  He
tis suddenly and deeply embarrassed.  He's just told her that
the loves her and she knows it.  He hangs up, traumatized.

<b>t82    INT. TOPEKA DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHTtttt82
</b>
tRussell's hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished.
tHe is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders.   Luggage
tfor the next city is stacked by the door.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttFire away.  I'm ready.  I'm on the
ttt"You" Train.  Take me there.

tThe kid plugs in his microphone.  Russell listens as he springs
this first question.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttDo you have to be depressed to write a
tttsad song?  Do you have to be in love
tttto write a love song?  Is a song better
tttif it really happened to you?  Like,
ttt"If You Say Nothing"... where did you
tttwrite that and how did it come about?

tRussell admires the many questions.  Says nothing.  He looks
tat his hand, thinks.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttWhen did you get so professional?

tIn the background, Penny Lane irons Silent Ed's shirt.
tGrinning, she cuffs his shoulder.  To the shirtless silent
tdrummer, waiting for his shirt.

<b>tttttPENNY
</b>tttI'm almost done with my shirt.

tEd watches her appreciatively, drumming silently on a rubber
tpad.  Penny kisses Russell, who swings her onto his lap.  In
tthe corner, Jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being
tunderappreciated.  And now Dick enters with a large cardboard
tbox.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttRussell, your dad showed up again.
tttAnd on a lighter note.
tttt(importantly)
tttGentlemen.  Your first t-shirts have
tttarrived.

tThere is an immediate buzz in the room, as Dick yanks open the
tbox filled with new white t-shirts.  He untangles the first fresh
tshirt, and displays it proudly.  A silent beat as all examine it -
ttheir first t-shirt.  Faces fall.  Ed stops drumming.  There has
tbeen a mistake.  It is a fuzzy band photo with the group name
temblazoned below.  Only Russell, who stand out front, is colored-
tin and emphasized on the shirt.  He turns away, making a noise.
tJeff stares at the t-shirt.  He's just about in tears.  There is
ta long silence and then... Ed resumes drumming on the rubber pad.

tttttDICK (cont'd)
tttIt's the record company's mistake.
tttAnd they will <i>pay.</i>  Shirts gone, band
ttthappy.

tHe drops the offending shirt into the trash, as if it were
tcontaminated, and exits with the box.  William watches as the
ttwo men, Russell and Jeff, move to opposite sides of the room.
tRussell puts on a shirt, so does Jeff.  The vibe is thick.
tRussel turns to see Jeff staring at him.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttCan we just skip the vibe and go
tttstraight to us laughing about this?

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttt(bitterly)
tttYeah.  Okay.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttt(trying for a joke)
tttBecause I can see by your face - you

</b>tttHow can you tell?  I'm just one of the
tttout-of-focus guys.

<b>tttttRUSSELL

tWilliam watches as Russell fishes the t-shirt out of the trash.

tttttRUSSELL (cont'd)
tttHere.  Take it.  You LOVE this shirt -

tttsay.

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttWell, it speaks pretty loudly to me.

</b>tttI'm always gonna tell you the truth.

</b>tttAre you doing coke again?

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>ttt<i>Oh yeah.  All the time.</i>

tThe kid looks down.

tttttJEFF (cont'd)
tttThis is big stuff, man.  From the very
tttbeginning -- we said -- I'm the front
tttman and you're the guitarist with
tttmystique.  That's the dynamic we agreed
ttton -- Page, Plant... Mick, Keith.  But
tttsomehow it's all turning around.  We
ttthave got to control what's happening
tttto us.  There's a responsibility here -

</b>tttExcuse me, but didn't we all get into
tttthis to <i>avoid</i> responsibility?

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttForgive me.
tttt(continuing, on shirt)
tttBut this is the slow-moving train of
tttcompromise that will <i>kill</i> us.

tRussell makes a disgusted noise.  Penny Lane exits discreetly,
tlooking back at William.

tttttJEFF (cont'd)
tttI can't say anymore with a writer here.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttYou can trust him,  you can say whatever
tttyou want.

</b>tttt(eyes suddenly moist)
tttI works as hard or <i>harder</i> than anybody

tttActually, that you can print.
tttt(continues to Russell)
tttAnd yet, why do I always end up feeling
tttlike I'm a joke to you?  I feel nothing
tttbut love for you.  We're a family.

tHe looks at the t-shirt and starts to cry.  Embarrassed, he
tgrows angrier.

tttttJEFF (cont'd)
tttYou want to pretend this isn't going
tttto be a very big band.  Well it is.  You
tttcall yourself a leader of this band, but

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttOh, this is the part where you quit -

tttRight.  I'm so predictable.

tFrustrated but feeling important, William hands him some of
tRussell's wet clothes. William deftly retrieves Russell's shoes
tand smoothly plucks the guitarist's sunglasses from the
tpartygoer who also wears his belt.  They move to the door in a
tpack.  We hear the beginning of Elton John's "Tiny Dancer."
tDick faces the crowd and addresses them in his "important"

t"Tiny Dancer" continues on the bus stereo.  Russell sits up

thave given him a wide berth.  He feels silly, and they know
tit, and he hates that they know it, which makes him feel
tfoolish.  He sits silently.  William watches him from four
trows back, next to Penny.  She kisses the top of his forehead,
ta hero's welcome. He yawns. The song's vocal begins.  There is
tonly more silence.  Then, after a beat, we hear a voice or
ttwo, fighting the quiet and singing along.  Then others...
twaking up... joining in.  Then Jeff.  Russell hears them and
tstarts to sing along too, louder now, without turning around.
tIt's a voice everyone wants to hear.  Like it or not, this is

tA wild Cleveland crowd in the building.  The cities on this
ttour are getting bigger, and so are the audiences.  And there
tis a whiff of business now too.  Men in satin tour jackets and
tsome Disc-jockey types cruise the backstage.  A Hysterical Fan
tis led screaming to the nearby medic room.  Few even react -
tit's Cleveland - as the shot finds William, tired and yawning,
ton the backstage pay phone.  He is absolutely ready for the
tworst.

tttHello?

tSilence.   Penny passes and stands near William, smoothing her
tpass.  They watch a new pack of groupies prowl the road-crew.
tThey are more glam, more trashy and less selective.  They glare
tinsolently at Penny Lane.  This is the future.

</b>tttListen to me.  He's a smart, good-

tthe truth.  He's <i>15?</i>

tttttELAINE (cont'd)
tttThis is not some apron-wearing mother

tShe hangs up.  Russell hangs up, oddly affected and shook up.

</b>tttSome people get her.  Some don't.

tRussell is still recovering.  William feels embarrassed by his
tmother, once again.

<b>t111   ON THE HUDDLEttttttt111
</b>
tWilliam with the band.  He yawns, as the band breaks.  Cleveland
tawaits.  We follow Dick, who guides the band onto the stage
tplatform, still in darkness.  Already, stomping and applause
tis mounting.  Russell turns to William before taking the stage:

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttYour Mom kind of freaked me out.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttShe means well.

tStill rattled, he takes the stage.  We see the unbridled
tenthusiasm of the faces on the front row.  A wave of cigarette
tlighters stretch out before them.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttt(importantly)
tttFrom Troy, Michigan...

tRussell thwacks a couple chords.  Audience thunders.  He turns
tto other members, feeling chills.  It's in these moments that
teverything else disappears.  They bow and wave, still in
tdarkness... each member seems to have his own fans.  Dick lets
tall this play out before finally adding...

tttttDICK (cont'd)
tttWould you please welcome to Cleveland...

tMore applause.  This is very very very very fun.

tttttDICK (cont'd)
tttStillwater.

tLights come up.  A full blast of audience love hits them right
tin the face, as they begin "Fever Dog."  The band charges
theadlong into their set, as various fans are squeezed up out
tof the crowd and onto the stage.

<b>tHANDHELD ON RUSSELL
</b>
tWho is in the middle of playing, as he smoothly whips off his
tguitar, and uses the instrument to send a Frenetic fan back
tinto the crowd.  He slips back under the strap, laughing.
tMore stage climbers spring up where that fan came from, and
tRussell now watches as Jeff Bebe dodges a fan and comes over
tto Russell to lean on him.  Russell turns to share the moment
twith Penny, dancing with arms in the air at the side of the
tstage.

<b>t112   INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHTttttt112

</b>tttSo when you play a great show like

tDick enters with great urgency.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttOkay.  I need everybody's attention.

tThe kid shuts his eyes.  He <i>knew</i> this would happen.

tttttDICK (cont'd)
tttAlright, well, the rumors are true.
tttThe record company has sent a big-time
tttmanager here to try and talk you into
tttreplacing me.  His name is Dennis Hope.
tttI know you've all heard of him.  He's

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttt(to William)
tttWe'll finish on the way to Boston.
tttYou can fly home from Boston.

tWilliam nods, exhausted, as Dick opens the door.  In walks a
tsmall general of a man in a baseball t-shirt, well-trimmed
tbeard and bowl cut.  He holds the super-new Halliburton
tbriefcase.  He is DENNIS HOPE, 25.  A man from the midwest,
twith a vision of the future of rock and roll.  Already in his
thead are all the things that will come to pass.  Higher ticket
tprices.  Merchandising deals.  Greater distribution and
taccounting of album sales.  He shrugs hello to the band.

<b>tttttDENNIS HOPE
</b>tttt(completely unthreatening)
tttHi.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttWe already have a manager.  He's been
tttwith us from the beginning.

tHope appreciates the lack of small talk.  He strides the room
twith the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort.
tRussell watches, dismissive, holding his guitar.

<b>tttttDENNIS HOPE
</b>tttRespectfully.  We all have our roots.
tttI believe in bands holding onto their
tttroots.  But those roots need to be
tttaugmented.  I'm gonna tell you the truth
ttt- I may enrage some and enthrall others.
tttI don't really give a fuck.   Your
tttmanager here <i>needs a manager.</i>  Example.
tttIf you hadn't run out on the contract in
tttPhoenix, you <i>could</i> have sued over
tttRussell's hand... but you left, negating
tttthe contract, forfeiting the deposit,
tttand you effectively traveled a long

tttelectrocute you.

tRussell looks at his hand.

tttttDENNIS HOPE (cont'd)
tttWe can all work together.  Your damages
ttthave put you way into the hole for

tttcompany more than you've got.  But

tttYou've got to take what you can, when you

tttBecause if you think Mick Jagger will

tttfor a moment, and think about whether

tHe leaves the room with a pleasant shrug.  Stunned silence.
tWilliam watches their body language.  No one wants to talk
tfirst.  Their faces read as -- who was that guy, and how can
twe talk him into staying?

tWilliam trudges the hallway with tape-recorder and notebook,
ttrolling for Russell.   He passes Boston travelogue posters on
tthe walls.  A few room doors are open, he looks for any sign
tof the guitarist.   William veers into Dick's room, where a
tpoker game full of Roadies is in progress.  The room is thick
twith exotic smoke.   They are a bunch of road-hardened snobs,
tsmoking cigars and other items, famous to themselves, listening
tnot to rock and roll... but Sarah Vaughn.

</b>tttLook.  Nobody's feelings are getting

tWilliam and Penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker-room
tbench.  It's a small dressing room, crowded with roadies,
tguitars and men in stages of half-dress.  Piles of luggage
theaded for New York sit by the door.  The door suddenly opens
tand Dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a
tsparkler.  It is placed in Penny's lap. It reads: Unforgettable
tPenny... Age Unknown.  Boston, 1973.   They gather now as the
tcake sits before a surprised and enchanted Penny Lane.

tof the cake.

tIt hits her.  She looks at William for a clue.  His truthful
tface does not look away.  Now she knows.  She turns to the
tothers -- <i>the plane isn't bigger?</i>  Shot moves in on Penny as
tshe blinks just a little, cutting into the cake, still mugging
tfor everybody, covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy
tlaughter.  Shot comes to rest behind her, her head turning to
tconnect with band members.  Each of them look away, nobody
tmaintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesn't
tlook at.  William.  She blows out the candles, vamping Marilyn
tMonroe-style, and sucks off the frosting seductively, to cheers.
tRussell watches, as we push in on Penny.  She notices all the
tluggage is gone, only her two cases remain by the door.

twith scenesters, long silver-haired glamsters, some British

tthe same clothes.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttWhy didn't you come back to the party?
tttBob Dylan showed up.  He was sitting
tttat our table for... had to be an hour,

tThe kid feels pain.

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttWhat happened to you last night?

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttIt's a log story.

tA sharp jolt of turbulence.  Russell begins pounding on the

ttt"Peggy Sure... Peggy Sue... "

tA moment of laughter, and then <i>bam.</i>  Jeff's drink rises and

tknock.

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttWe shouldn't be here.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttDoris, we miss you!

tFear is creeping in around the edges.  William, already an
tuneasy flier, looks down.

<b>tttttPILOT'S VOICE
</b>tttThis is Craig, your pilot.  It appears
tttwe've caught the edge of that electrical

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttt(strapping in for a roller

tttRock and roll.

tThe sky darkens abruptly. William looks up, increasingly
tnervous, stares straight ahead.  The plane suddenly drops and
tstabilizes.  Everyone is silent but Russell.

tttttRUSSELL (cont'd)
tttWooooooo Baby!

tA moment later, an ashen-faced CO-PILOT emerges, balancing
thimself with hands on the ceiling of the shuddering plane.

<b>tttttCO-PILOT
</b>tttWe're gonna try to land in Tupelo.
tttWe're going to have to cut the inside

tThe kid notices Silent Ed is rubbing a small crucifix.

<b>tttttDENNIS HOPE
</b>tttA <i>field?</i>

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttI can't breathe.

tPush in on Russell. We hear a series of unfamiliar electrical
tsounds.  The plane screwballs through the sky.

<b>tttttCO-PILOT
</b>tttIt might be a rough set-down.  We should
tttbe fine.
tttt(cracking at the edges)
tttBut what we do say in a situation like

ttthelp us, if there's anything you want
tttto say to each other, any secrets,
tttanything like that, now would be a
tttgood time.  But just hang in there.
tttWe'll get you out of this.

tHe returns to the cockpit.  The weather worsens, as the hail
tsuddenly pelts the plane, and it comes down hard.  Inside lights
tshut off.   William stares straight ahead, as the cockpit door
tswings open - total chaos visible inside - and then shuts again.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttAnd everyone thinks it's so glamorous
tttout here.

tJust shaking.  Nearly in tears.   Hyperventilating.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttIf something should happen.  I love
tttall of you.  I don't think we have to
tttdo the secrets thing.

tThe plane shakes.  Now lightening strikes very close.  A
tflashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and
tevaporates with a burning smell still in the air.  In the
tdarkness:

<b>tttttDENNIS HOPE

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttI love you all too, and you're my

tWilliam watches, catatonic.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttt(to Larry and Ed)
tttYou hate me?  <i>You too?</i>

tLarry stares at him.  Ed says nothing.

tttttRUSSELL (cont'd)

tttt(incredulous, giddy)
tttAnd you don't even <i>like</i> me.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttt(to Jeff)
ttt<i>Whatever happens, you're dead.</i>

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttDon't be self-righteous, Russell, not
tttnow.  You were sleeping with Penny,
tttthat groupie.  Last summer, and up
tttuntil <i>yesterday.</i>  Why don't you tell
tttLeslie THAT?

tRussell tries to get up and attack him.  The force keeps him
tin his seat.  He yells.  Loud.

<b>tttttDENNIS
</b>tttt(freaking out)
tttI quit.

tThe turbulence worsens.  William finds his mouth saying
temotional words he cannot control.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>ttt"That groupie?"  She was a <i>Band-Aid.</i>
tttAll she did was love your band.  And
tttyou all -- you used her, <i>all of you.</i>
tttYou used her and threw her away.  She
tttalmost died last night, while you were

tttShe was your <i>biggest fan</i> and you threw
ttther away.  And if you can't see that,
ttt<i>that's</i> your biggest problem.

tRussell and Jeff stare at each other.   The plane is rocking
tvery very hard.  Leslie is crying.

<b>tttttED
</b>tttI'm gay.

tThey all turn to the silent drummer.  (It's his first spoken
tdialogue of the movie.)

tThen.

tThe plane pops out from below the clouds.  Sunshine spikes
tthrough the embattled windows of the plane, as they float
tdownwards to the city of Tupelo, Mississippi.  A very very
tuneasy silence fills the plane.  No one can look at each other.
tOut bursts the Co-Pilot, giddy with victory.

<b>tttttCO-PILOT
</b>tttThank God above, WE'RE ALIVE!!   WE'RE
<b>tttALIVE!!  WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT!!
</b>
tShot of all the occupants, ending with Russell.  Suddenly, the
talternative seems far more attractive.  We hear Rod Stewart's
t"Jo's Lament" as music plays over their still-shocked faces.

<b>t148   INT. TUPELO AIRPORT CORRIDOR -- DAYtttt148
</b>
tMusic continues, as they walk together like ghosts in a long
tand very pregnant silence, ignoring the kid.  Everything is
tdifferent now.  The kid peels off and throws up in a dumpster.
tWe continue with the band, unhappily moving forward.  William
thustles back to catch up.  They ignore him.  There are much
tbigger thoughts in play.  No one wants to speak.

<b>tttttJEFF
</b>tttWell, I think we can build on this new
ttthonesty.

tBoom.  Russell attacks him, and they're pulled apart.  The
tband continues moving forward, arriving at a fork in the airport
tterminals.  William stops.  This is where he must part company.
tHe stands at the mouth of the next terminal, as the band
tcontinues, unaware he's split off.   He watches their backs,
tthey've forgotten him.

tThen Russell turns, sensing something missing.  William.  All
tnow stop and turn.  Still shell-shocked, they summon a pre-
toccupied but heartfelt goodbye.  William waves.  Music
tcontinues.

</b>tttWell, it's finally over with Leslie.
tttI'm going to call her.

</b>tttLet her retire.
tttt(he doesn't respond)
tttYou want to lock her up in a house in
tttMichigan?  <i>Please.</i>
tttt(he doesn't respond)
tttWrite her a song someday.  She deserves
tttit.  Something about that girl brought
tttout the best in a lot of...
tttt(looks around backstage)
ttt... pretty average people.  She deserves
tttit...

tRussell stares into his crew meal, nodding a little.

tttttSAPPHIRE (cont'd)
tttt(forward thinking)
ttt... because something tells me twenty
tttyears from now, we'll remember her...
tttand <i>not much else.</i>

tRussell smiles to himself, knows it's true.  Dick passes,
tplacing hands on Russell's shoulders, massaging a little.

<b>tttttDICK
</b>tttHave a good vacation.  I hope the band
tttstays together.  Before it all went
tttdown the shitter, it was starting to
tttget really good.

tDick claps Russell on the back, and moves on.  He turns to
tSapphire.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttI'm not going to blame myself.  I do
tttmake people happy.  They just shouldn't
tttget to know me... 'cause it appears to
tttspoil everything.

</b>tttDon't be so easy on yourself.

</b>tttWhat gives you the right to get this
tttpersonal with me.

<b>tttttSAPPHIRE

<b>t158   INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT -- NIGHTtttt158
</b>
tWilliam moves like a zombie through the airport, and collapses
tin a seat.  He sits still in the crowded flow of human traffic.
tA cluster of Flight Attendants pass.  One stops, a stylish young
twoman wearing a tall bubble-shaped PSA hat with swirling colors.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttWilliam?

tHe looks at her.  He feels like he's on Mars, and she looks
tlike a Martian.

tttYou guys this is my <i>brother!</i>

</b>tttt(ad if meeting a celebrity)

</b>tttYou guys, I'll deadhead back later.  I
tttthink I'm needed.

<b>tttttMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>tttNice to finally meet you.

</b>tttYou have a good day!

tAnita looks in her brother's face.

</b>tttYou look awful, but that's <i>great.</i>
tttYou're living your <i>life!</i>  You're finally
tttfree of... her.

</b>tttYeah.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttHey.  I'll take off work.  Let's have
tttan adventure together.  You and me,
tttfinally.  Anywhere you want to go.
tttAnywhere in the world.

<b>t159   EXT. WILLIAM'S HOME -- DAYttttt159
</b>
tWilliam whistles the family whistle.  Sister and brother trudge
tup the steps.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttThis is not my idea of a good time.

<b>tttttWILLIAM
</b>tttJust get me to my bed.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttt(resigned)
tttI'll deal with her.

tWilliam whistles again.  Mom meets them at the door.  She looks
tat her trashed son who has finally come home.  For the first
ttime, she hugs Anita first, and it's not lost on Anita.

tIt's a clumsy neck-hug, neither wanting to commit.  The kid
tpasses to his Mother's left, with suitcase, intentionally
tnudging her into his sister.  Anita takes this as an aggressive
tact of love, and hugs her mother back.  Tears stream down Mom's
tface.  Their cheeks touch. Mom pulls away, and sees her own
ttears on Anita's face.  Thinking that she's also crying, she
tgrabs a tissue for them both.

<b>t160   INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUSttttt160
</b>
tThe kid stands in the hallway listening, shaking his head,
tpoised to enter his room, unseen by them.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttt(so worried)
tttWhat are we going to do about him?

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttI don't know.  Whatever happened to him, I
tttjust wish it could have happened to me.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttThe magazine killed his story.

tNow they really hug, Anita gulping back real tears.  William
twatches them bonding over the oddest thing - his failure.
tWilliam goes into the bedroom, the final three feet to sleep,
tand shuts the door.  A hand places a hotel sign on the door -
tDO NOT DISTURB.  Slight push in.

<b>tON BED
</b>
tHe collapses with all his clothes on, almost instantly asleep.  His
twalls, just as he left them, boast a pantheon of rock heroes...
twith a very lonely Abraham Lincoln (or Atticus Finch)  in the center.

<b>t161   INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAYttttt161
</b>
tThe elevator doors ding open, and out walks Russell Hammond.
tThe Secretary has just finished answering the phone, "Straight
tArrow Publishers."  She puts the caller on hold.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttHi, I'm Russel Hammond.

<b>tttttSECRETARY
</b>tttYou're here regarding?

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttMy life.

<b>t162   INT. EDITORIAL OFFICE - DAYttttt162
</b>
tRussell stands with the editors, observing the fine portraits
ton the walls.  He's behind enemy lines, and he knows it.
tEverything in the room fascinates him.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttI don't care what happens.  I don't
tttcare if you put us on the cover.  But
tttyou sent us a kid and... and he was a
tttfan.   And we all made friends with
ttthim - absolutely, to get a good story.
tttBut then we actually liked him.  We
tttthought he's... show us our lives in
tttsome mythic way and I guess... we're
tttnot mythic.  We panicked.

<b>tttttJANN
</b>tttYou denied most of the story.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttYeah, well, here's the problem with
tttthe truth.  It's too <i>true</i> -

<b>tttttBEN
</b>tttWell, we appreciate the visit.  The
tttlast time an artist came here, it was
tttBuddy Miles and he punched me.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttI'm not punching anybody.  I am
tttpersonally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a
tttvoyage of self-reinvention.  This is
tttabout William Miller.
tttt(counting off fingers)
tttHe lives with us, he lost his virginity,
ttthe saw us at our worst, appreciated
tttour best, he saved two lives, including
tttmine... he smuggled about a half-pound
tttof pot into Boston, and we never even
ttttold him -

tNearby, David Felton looks at another editor, raising an
teyebrow.

tttttRUSSELL (cont'd)
ttt-- we told him too much, we told him
ttteverything...  He almost died with us
tttover Tupelo... if the band survives
ttthim, it'll be a miracle... but you
tttknow, he tried to keep up, and <i>that's
ttta journalist to me.</i>

<b>tttttJANN
</b>tttIt's too late.  We're going with a
tttdifferent cover.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttt(immediately)
tttThank God.

tBut Russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead
tlegendary rock stars, fixing on the one photo closest to all of
tthem, a very vulnerable-looking Janis Joplin.  A second thought.

tttttRUSSELL (cont'd)
tttYou tell me it's too late.  But I could
tttgo back to my hotel room and... and
tttO.D. tonight and something tells me
tttyou'd <i>find a way</i> to put me on the cover
tttof the next issue.  Am I right?

tHe looks at their faces.  They cannot disagree.

tttttRUSSELL (cont'd)
tttI'm learning the game.
tttt(beat, shrug)
tttWe fucked up.  We made friends with him.

<b>tttttBEN
</b>tttNext time we'll all be more
tttprofessional.

<b>tttttRUSSELL
</b>tttMaybe so.
tttt(beat, an odd thought)
tttBut God forbid, the day comes when
tttselling yourself is as important as
tttthe music you make.
tttt(rueful, to Hendrix on the
tttwall)
tttYou might have died at the right time,
tttmy friend.

</b>tttThank you for visiting.  Good luck.

tat the entrance.  Raises his hand.

tttttRUSSELL (cont'd)
tttGood evening!

<b>t162A  EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAYtttttt162A
</b>
tRussell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go.
tOddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to
tspeak to him again... little noises everywhere, turning into a
tmusic of its own.  It's a beautiful and compelling "silence."
tHe thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath
tof life.  His head filling again with the music of the world,
the begins to walk down the street.  Very naturally, and quite
trandomly, he is noticed by young passersby.  They can't help
tit.  He looks like a star.  They can't quite figure out who it
tis, but it's <i>someone,</i> and they begin to follow him down the
tstreet.   Unbeknownst to him as he walks along, deep in thought,
ta small crowd begins to form... following him.

<b>t163   INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - DAYttttt163
</b>
tA quiet kitchen.  Anita has been cooking.  A substantial
tbreakfast has been placed on the table.  Sausage, orange
tjuice... and now Anita sets down a plate of pancakes, with
tsyrup and butter, in front of her mother.  William watches his
tmother facing an old enemy - white sugar.

<b>tttttANITA
</b>tttThey're called pancakes.  Who knows
tttwhen we'll be together again.  Splurge.
tttIt's what most people call breakfast.

tMom looks at her children, and takes a breath.

<b>tttttELAINE
</b>tttI went through your records.  And I
tttfound a song to play for you.

tShe goes to the stereo and puts on a record.  The two children
teye each other - what's coming next?  (Song to be chosen)
tThe two kids eye each other again.  Self-consciously avoiding
ttheir gaze, Mom sits and toys with her breakfast.  It's a song
tshe clearly wants them to hear.  It's a song from the heart.
tThey look at her, amazed.  Elaine looks up, regards her family.
tSomehow they're back at this table.  They continue eating
tbreakfast.

tnewsstand pavement with a thud.  Someone reaches in to cut the
tcord, as the magazines puff up into view.  It's the new issue,
twith Russell Hammond on the cover.  The title: Stillwater Runs
tDeep.  Just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in
