<b>PLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THE 
</b><b>LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS.
</b>







<b>FADE IN:
</b><b>BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES
</b>
<b>1ttEXT. - SKY NIGHTttttttttttt
</b>
The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes

<b>2ttEXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT
</b>
A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see

<b>3ttEXT. - THE CITY - DAYt
</b>
Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.

<b>4ttCLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS
</b>
As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.

<b>5ttROOFTOP - THE RUNNERt
</b>
The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly  starts to descend.
<b> 
</b><b>6ttINT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATORt
</b>
From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into  the crowd.

<b>7 ttOUT
</b>
<b>8ttWITH THE RUNNER
</b>
As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.

<b>9ttANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDORtttttt
</b>
Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.

<b>10ttWITH THE RUNNERttt
</b>
Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.

<b>11ttTHE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)tttttttt
</b>
Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.

<b>12ttP.O.V.tt
</b>
The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.

<b>13ttTHE SANDMANttt
</b>
Emotionless. Aims. Fires.

<b>14ttTHE RUNNER - CLOSEttt
</b>
Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.

<b>15ttTHE SANDMANtt
</b>
Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.

<b>16ttEXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)t
</b>
Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.

<b>MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>(TITLES END)
</b>
<b>17ttCLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)tt
</b>
Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal


<b>18ttINT. - NURSERY CORRIDORtt
</b>
The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.

<b>19ttOUT
</b>
<b>19X1ttLOGAN ttt
</b>
Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.

He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttWake up...come on, Logan-6.

<b>19X2ttFRANCIS
</b>
entering .

ttttttFRANCIS  (shakingt
    ttttthis head in  mild, mocking
t    ttttdisbelief)t
tttYou are here. I  couldn't 
tttbelieve it when they told me.  
tttWhat are you doing?
<b>t
</b>ttttttLOGAN (still knocking  
t    tttton the soundless glass)  
tttTurn this way. 
t    tttt(as one of the infants 
t   ttttstirs, smiles, bubbles) 
tttNo,  no...not you...YOU!
<b>t
</b>Francis tries to pull Logan away from the  window, but Logan is
intent on waking one of  the infants.

<b>ttttttFRANCIS               
</b>tttYou should've seen me take my  
tttlast Runner...perfect. 
t    tttt(Logan  continues to pound the  
t     tttsoundless glass) 
tttI backed him  up against a residence 
tttpool and  when he terminated...his  
ttthand... 
t    tttt(breaks off as Logan
t    ttttis paying  no attention)
tttSo now you've seen him...what's
tttthe difference awake or asleep?

ttttttLOGAN (to infant)   
tttOpen your eyes once, idiot.  
ttttt(to Francis) 
tttIt's not every  day that a Sandman 
tttson is  born. I'm telling you, 
tttFrancis  - that's him!

<b>ttttttFRANCIS    
</b>tttMaybe,  maybe not. What's the  
tttdifference? Come on,  Logan, 
tttlet's get out of  here before 
ttteverybody  finds out.

But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an  idea.

<b>ttttttFRANCIS 
</b>tttOkay...you really want to wake 
ttthim up?

Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound an
<b>ALARM.
</b>
<b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>tttHey, cut that out !

Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they
stand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and
stops him from  prying at the panel:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttNow you've done it...

The CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:

<b>ttttttVOICE 
</b>tttBreak-in scanners report intrusion, 
tttidentify.

<b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>tttLogan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty
tttquadrant. Intrusion accidental.

<b>ttttttVOICE
</b>tttClear Logan-5 and Francis-7.

The violet light goes off.


ttttttFRANCIS (with affection:
tttttto Logan) 
tttHad enough?

ttttttLOGAN (looking at the infant)
tttEven the alarm didn't wake him.

As Francis starts out:

ttttttLOGAN (one last look; 
tttttjoining Francis)
tttAll right, Francis...I'm with you.

They move off down the corridor...the lights behind them DIMMING as
they  pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN
automatically  tended.

CHIMES...soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.

<b>ttttttVOICE
</b>tttSleep time...go to sleep.
tttSleeping time, little ones.

As they exit Nursery...Logan stops and takes one final look
backward.

<b>ttttttFRANCIS
</b>tttYou need a lift. Let's go 
tttto Arcade and celebrate...
ttttt(teasing tone)
tttyour alert successor...Logan-6.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>tttHas anyone ever broken in to 
tttwhere the babies are?

<b>ttttttFRANCIS 
</b>ttttt(putting a card key into a door 
tttttwhich opens soundlessly) 
tttNot in my time...

They move through the door which closes.

<b>20ttEXT. - MAZE STATION - NIGHT
</b>
They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways,  each glowing faintly. They pause, waiting.




ttttttFRANCIS (peering 
tttttat Logan curiously)
tttWhy?

<b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>tttjust wondered...what happens?

ttttttFRANCIS (shrugs) 
tttDunno...flameout maybe. Whatever 
ttthappens, you can bet it's final. 
tttBut who would want to find out?

One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a  kind of twilight.

<b>21ttINT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS
</b>
The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They   move off.
<b> 
</b><b>22ttEXT. - MAZE- CAR
</b>
Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:

<b>23ttTHE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE
</b>
Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears  into a tunnel.

<b>24ttMAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE
</b>
As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a
gathering  CROWD.

<b>25ttFULL SHOT - ARCADE
</b>
Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.

<b>26ttWITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS
</b>
As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing...

<b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>tttbut you don't know, you Just 
tttsay what everyone says.  One for 
tttone. One for one."

<b>ttttttFRANCIS 
</b>tttWell, why no!? That's exactly how
ttteverything works. How else could 
tttthe city stay in balance -You have
ttta better idea?
<b> 
</b>
ttttttLOGAN (laughs)
tttNo, but at least I wonder sometimes -- 
tttinstead of doing that "one for one" song tt
tttof yours. You sound like a sleepteacher 
tttWith a stuck tape.

<b>ttttttFRANCIS
</b>tttWell the minute you get a better
tttidea you can stop wondering.
ttttt(beat)
tttYou know, Logan -- you wonder 
ttta lot. Too much for a Sandman

They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
<b>REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!
</b><b> 
</b>As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts  back to RELIVE.

As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to  Logan and Francis and moves on.

<b>27ttARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU
</b>
They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of  her with his hands framing his face.

<b>ttttttMAN
</b>tttWell? How do you like it?

ttttttWOMAN (critically) 
tttI don't know. The cheeks maybe...
tttlook a little -

<b>ttttttMAN 
</b>tttCheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, 
tttyou think?

<b>ttttttWOMAN 
</b>tttToo little.

<b>ttttttMAN 
</b>tttToo little?
ttttt(gestures)
tttToo little. Okay, wait for me.

And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances
around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.

<b>28ttARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP
</b>
Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
"yes...yes..." As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them.

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttDid you ever see Francis-8?

ttttttFRANCIS (shaking his head) 
tttI never even visited Nursery before 
ttttonight. 
ttttt(beat) 
tttWhen you wonder, it slows you up --
tttyou know?

They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise:  LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT...here the people going
in are simply  excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds...

<b>ttttttFRANCIS 
</b>tttI don't know what makes you so curious. 
tttYou have any idea who his seed-mother was?

ttttttLOGAN (quickly) 
tttOf course not! I m curious, not sick.
ttttt(laughs)

The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.

<b>29ttFULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL
</b>
An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:

<b>ttttttFRANCIS
</b>tttand that's my friend, Logan. 
ttttt(as she acknowledges 
tttttthe introduction)
tttWe're celebrating his next in line.
tttCarousel - Arcade - who knows? 
tttWant to come along?

ttttttWOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)
tttOnly if I make it to the top of
tttCarousel.
ttttt(she holds up her hand)
tttThirty -- and the big spin.

In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her
a  half-squeeze.

<b>ttttttFRANCIS 
</b>tttYou're thirty -- already? I always 
tttthought I was older than you - 
ttttt(beat)
tttWell, give it a good try.

ttttttWOMAN (pleasantly) 
tttYou know I always have.

Another beautiful WOMAN joins them.

tttttt2ND WOMAN (to the first) 
tttSorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. 
tttItxb9s  my Love-Shop turn.

<b>ttttttWOMAN
</b>tttThat's all right. Happy turn.

<b>tttttt2ND WOMAN
</b>tttYou'll renew. I've got a feeling.

 ttttttWOMAN (smiles) 
tttSo do I...but if I don't at least I'll 
ttthave the ultimate thrill. I'd almost 
tttrather have that than renew.

<b>tttttt2ND WOMAN 
</b>tttI feel the same way. Sometimes I think 
tttI'm not even going to try and renew when 
tttmy time comes. But -- that's three years away.
tttSo long.

The 2nd Woman walks away.

ttttttFRANCIS (after a beat; 
tttttto first Woman) 
 tttIt's been nice.

<b>ttttttWOMAN
</b>tttUm-huh.

They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm
and  they move off.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttttFRANCIS
</b>tttI guess you never had her?

Logan shakes his head.

<b>ttttttFRANCIS
</b>tttYou missed something special.

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttWell...you can't have them all.

<b>ttttttLOGAN AND FRANCIS 
</b>ttttt(together, it's an old joke)
 tttBut you can try.

They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.

<b>ttttttFRANCIS 
</b>tttThe damned Yellows are getting out 
tttof hand. Those three ought to be in 
tttCathedral. No business scrambling in 
tttArcade...

ttttttLOGAN (laughs 
tttttcuffs Francis' arm)
tttWhat an old, old man you're getting 
tttto be, Francis. Weren't you ever a 
tttYellow? I bet you were even wilder 
tttthan -
ttttt(he breaks off as the lights 
tttttin the Great Hall dim) 
ttt-- come on, Sandman.

The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.
<b> 
</b><b>30ttFULL SHOT - GREAT HALL
</b>
As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains
have parted to reveal

<b>31ttARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE
</b>
AC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling  TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE  deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...

<b>32ttWITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS
</b>
In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>tttYou should have been with us in Nursery,  
tttDaniel. I'm positive I  recognized him -

ttttttFRANCIS (hustling
tttttLogan)
tttCome on. I don't want to miss the
tttfiling-in. There'll be some I know
ttttonight, I think...

ttttttDANIEL (glances at his
tttttown red crystal, nods)
tttYes. Me, too. You know we're
tttboth on Monitor tonight.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttttFRANCIS
</b>tttDamn! That's right. Just when I
tttfeel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
tttArcade .
<b>t
</b><b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttWant me to take your shift? I'm
tttfeeling restless anyway
<b>tt
</b>Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see

<b>33ttFULL SHOT - CAROUSEL
</b>
framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in
changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --t
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...

<b>34.ttANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated.

<b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>tttNow there's a few who could have been 
ttthis seed-mother.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttttFRANCIS 
</b>tttOnly a few? You're just not trying.

<b>35-36t    OUT
</b>
<b>37ttPANNING THE CROWD
</b>
As the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...

SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...

<b>38 ttOUT
</b>
<b>38X1ttANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS
</b>
Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.

<b>39ttTHE CROWDt
</b>
Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.

<b>40ttLASTDAY GROUPt
</b>
Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.

<b>41ttCROWD
</b>
Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.

<b>42ttCAROUSEL
</b>
As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...

<b>43ttCROWD
</b>
Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see

<b>44ttCAROUSEL
</b>
Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.

<b>45ttLOGAN
</b>
Caught up in it Like the rest.

<b>46ttCAROUSEL
</b>
Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.

Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.
<b>tt
</b>SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.

<b>47ttFULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN
</b>
Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:

<b>48ttFULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL
</b>
High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.

<b>49ttMEDIUM ANGLE - A MANtt
</b>
At the highest level...straining for the rainbow...

<b>54ttWIDE ANGLE - THE CAROUSELt
</b>
Whirling - whirling - the rainbows shining.

<b>55ttWIDE ANGLE - THE BLEACHERStt
</b>
Orgiastic pleasure -- a Spanish crowd at a perfect killing --
SCREAMING, fulfilled.

<b>56 ttOUT
</b>
<b>57ttFULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL
</b>Other figures move to the topmost level...straining for the rainbow
bands.

<b>58ttCLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCISttt
</b>
As the SCREAMING goes on in the b.g. of the SHUT... we hear a
BUZZING noise. Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,
dark plastic box.

Logan looks at the box. On it we see:

<b>tttMAN: RELIVE STORE 14tt
</b><b>ttt
</b><b>ttttt tLOGAN 
</b>ttttt(to Francis)t
tttLooks like I'm working.
<b>tt
</b>Francis stands.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttWho invited you?

<b>ttttttFRANCIS
</b>tttI'm in my party mood.
<b>tt
</b>Logan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers.

They make their way into the hall.

Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.

Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.

As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:

<b>59-
</b><b>59X11t    WIDE ANGLE - A MAN tt
</b>
running.

CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.

A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.

B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.

C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.

D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.t

<b>(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)
</b>
E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.

F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.

G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.

H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.

I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.

J. The Runnerxb9s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.

K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.

L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.

M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.

N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.

<b>59X12-
</b><b>63X1tt    OUT

<b>63X2ttWITH LOGANt
</b>
As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.

A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.
<b>t
</b><b>63X4ttANOTHER ANGLEt
</b>
As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.

<b>63X5ttINSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:
</b>
The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION

<b>63X6ttLOGAN
</b>
Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly.

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttRunner terminated 0:31

tttReady for cleanup.

Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.

tttThat was a great shot you made.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttttFRANCIS
</b>tttYes.
ttttt(beat)
tttBut you look a little rusty to me --
tttwhat were you doing, wondering?

Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the
hall, passing CAMERA
<b>t
</b><b>63X7ttANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.

<b>63X8tt1ST STICKMAN AND BODYt
</b>
The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.t
<b>ttttt
</b><b>63X9ttCORPSE (INSERT)
</b>
It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.

<b>63X10tt1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS
</b>
Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.
<b>tt
</b><b>63X11tt2ND STICKMAN
</b>
Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.
<b>ttt
</b><b>63X12ttCLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN

Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.
<b>ttt
</b><b>63X13ttANOTHER ANGLEt
</b>
As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.

<b>63X14ttLOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE
</b>
Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill.

<b>ttttttFRANCIS 
</b>ttt...Well I think you're getting stale. 
tttYou need old Lucey--Go on. Gee the whole

He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.

And he is gone.
<b>t
</b><b>63X15ttLOGAN

waves, smiling, then turns to the Hallucimill.

<b>63X16ttPOV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.
</b>
Crazy, man.

<b>63X17ttBACK TO LOGANt
</b>
Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:
<b>tt
</b><b>63X18ttPOV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELSt
</b>
The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.

<b>63X19ttLOGANtt
</b>Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.

<b>63X20ttLOGAN'S APARTMENTt
</b>
As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.

<b>63X21ttAT THE WALL RECESStt
</b>
As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.

<b>63X22ttLOGAN AT THE CONSOLEt
</b>
Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.
<b>tt
</b><b>63X23ttJESSICA AND LOGAN
</b>
Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.

<b>64ttLOGAN AND JESSICA
</b>
As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised.

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttWhat's wrong, Available?

<b>ttttttJESSICA 
</b>ttttt(breaking away gently)

She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.

ttttthe understands)
tttYou mean "not here"--that's it?

</b>tttI suppose. But what if you want

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttSo? Do what everyone does. Try

Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttWhen this turns black...that's it.

tttIf for any reason you want to be 31...

</b>tttYou're years away . . . I don't know
tttwhy you're thinking of these things,
tttmuch less talking about them.
ttttt(offering Jessica the gun) 
tttWant to try?

Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully...in an
admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttWhat Quad do you live in?

<b>ttttttJESSICA 
</b><b>tttK.
</b>
ttttttLOGAN (softly)
tttYou're sure you don't want to try?

<b>ttttttLOGAN t
</b>tttIt's nice to know you can nod.t

Jessica smiles.

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttIt's nice co know you can do that,
ttttoo.
<b>t
</b>Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity,
Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort
after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan:
<b>t
</b><b>ttttttFRANCIS
</b>tttThese are for me -- you've got your
tttown.
ttttt(looking after Jessica)
tttShe must have been something--?
<b>t
</b>At Logan's expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all.

<b>64X1ttEXT. - SAND MAN H.Q.
</b>
A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper, fronted by
broad steps. Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out... His uniform is in tatters. They greet one another...then:

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttWhat happened to you?

ttttttSANDMAN (embarrassed)
tttI lost a Runner in Cathedral.

</b>tttYou? Why? You're already beautiful.

<b>64X2ttINT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - READY ROOM
</b>
As Logan and Francis cross the room, Logan nods to other Sandmen,
who are monitoring areas of the Megalopolis on video consoles. One
of these Sand-men speaks to Francis who hasn't greeted them

tttttSANDMAN (Monitor)
tttWhat's with you, Francis?
<b>t
</b>tttttFRANCIS (touching his
tttthead; grimacing)
tttLast night
<b>tt
</b>The other Sandmen, including Logan, smile as Logan and Francis
continue to:

<b>65-68tOUT
</b>
<b>69ttINT. - SANDMAN H.Q. - DEBRIEFING AREA
</b>
Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room. As they walk. . . they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKS...WHITE,
<b>YELLOW GREEN AND RED.
</b><b> t  
</b>Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city, governing everyone's crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.

There are no humans.

Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.

Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)

The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner
on the overhang above.t
<b>ttt
</b>Francis stands alongside the table...his attitude is very matter-of
fact. He has been through this procedure many, many times.
He touches his head...(the hangover)...and Logan smiles. Moments
later...the scanner stops...the word:
<b>t|t
</b><b>tttIDENTIFY
</b>
appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . .
and the words:
<b>t
</b><b>tttCLEAR
</b><b>tttFRANCIS-7
</b>
appear on the SCREEN.

<b>ttttttFRANCIS
</b>tttSee you in the hydrotoner!
<b>tt
</b>Logan nods.

Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death. Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry.

Logan is standing nonchalantly...as the scanner moves over the
items...waiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier.

The scanner continues scanning.

Logan starts becoming impatient...but the scanning goes on and on
and on.

Now...Logan is clearly puzzled...it has never...ever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time.

Suddenly, directly before him...on the SCREEN... the word:

<b>ttPROBABILITY
</b>
blinks on and off...on and off...catching Logan's attention. As
Logan turns toward the SCREEN...the scanner stops moving. The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:
<b>t
</b><b>ttAPPROACH
</b>
We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . .
that he has never seen this before.
<b>tt
</b>Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN. There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystal....glowing on an arm of the chair.

The word on the SCREEN is now:

<b>ttIDENTIFY
</b>
Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove.
We hear a HUMMING NOISE....then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words
appear on the SCREEN:

Before the startled Logan can finish...he feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat.

Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes.

As the glow subsides...Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated,
fearful.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttQuestion:

The words on the SCREEN read:

ttttttLOGAN (very urgent) 
tttQuestion: Do I get my four years back?

Too late. The SCREEN is BLANK. For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind, turns away.

Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh. Almost
automatically, he starts moving his hand toward the groove...but the
SCREEN already has the words:

<b>ttCLEAR LOGAN-5
</b>
Logan looks at it - then:

The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room.... past the GIANT

CRYSTAL....and continues out into:

Francis.... in a whirlpool bath....trying to recover from has
incredible hangover.

holding his hand against his leg.

for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:

has obviously escorted her there.

</b>tttShe has.

Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile
widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.

As they pass, Jessica looks full in the face of one of the
followers, looks away. Logan does not notice. The followers are
partly reassured. One of the men is now holding a garrote made from
his necklace. The man who first followed gestures and the others go
off purposefully. He continues after Logan and Jessica as they exit
round a corner.

reluctant to give up his place and when he does, he remains standing
there, watching. He loves the work--they all do.

Logan and Jessica entering. Logan is aware of Jessica's increasing
tension. He pretends unconcern, but he is wary.

</b>
Behind them, visible through the crowd--two of the men we saw
before. The Follower and the man with the garrote. They are moving
so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest, streams coming together to move to a higher level.

<b>94X12tFEATURING JESSICAt

As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for
Logan. Catching a glimpse of the followers, she makes a small sound,
hesitates, pretends to have stumbled.

Closer now, closing in -- the wire garrote gleaming between the
man's hands.

Suddenly she stops. He comes round facing as people eddy by them.
Logan looks at her searchingly.

<b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>tttTell me, Jessica.

Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his
hands. One more step... Logan senses something, half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver.
Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side,
Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too.
<b>t

As the Runner alarm pulses and the readout flashes its message:

The Sandman at the console turns and says:tt

<b>tttttt1ST SANDMAN
</b>tttHey, Logan's got a mean one tonight--
tttwhy don't you--

But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others

see them" etc.

ttttttLOGAN (smiling)
tttLet's see - how long has it been?

As Jessica turns her head...looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car
slides to a stop.

A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens.

<b>ttttttVOICEttt

Now the hatch opens. They step out, Logan first, Jessica timidly,
looking around. Behind them the hatch closes, the maze-car sighs
away into the distance.

<b>ttttttJESSICA
</b>tttI've never been in this quadrant.
ttttt(looks off)
tttIs that Arcade off there?
<b>tt
</b>There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an "elevated" station.
<b>tt
</b><b>121X2tPOV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRAL
</b>
Arcade shining like distant fireworks.

<b>122ttEXT. - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRAL
</b>
Below them a narrow, sharply angled concrete canyon, buttressed
walls rising featureless. The look of an old fortress, blank, dim
and cool. Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
"Cathedral Plaza--2025 A.D.--Skidmore, Rosenfelt, Hennesy
architects."

Jessica shivers, looking around her. Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon, move toward the wall. Their footsteps the
only SOUND.

<b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>tttLet me go first. Sometimes they're 
tttwaiting just inside there--to rush 
tttyou when it opens...

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttQuickly now--

He helps her through the narrow opening--the portal's walls are very
thick.. They turn abruptly and see:

<b>123ttINT. - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBER
</b>
A room of angled, reflecting surfaces. At one end a jagged corridor,
also mirrored, leads away. The zigzag, angled effect creates an
absolute confusion of images. but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor. Jessica hangs back, momentarily
certain she's about to smash into something.

ttttttLOGAN (guiding her) 
tttJust follow--no matter how it seems...

ttttttJESSICA (doing her
tttttbest)
tttBut what is this--why?

ttttt(gesture)

<b>ttttttJESSICA
</b>tttMuscle? I don't know that one.
<b>t
</b>Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. It's stop and go--a
fun house in which you can get hurt.
<b>t

</b>tttIt's unauthorized. No good for any-

<b>t
</b>Jessica reacts...to what Logan has said...then:  A moment later:
<b>t
</b><b>124ttANOTHER ANGLEt
</b>
As they approach the end of the corridor, a small FIGURE in a
tattered garment approaches them. She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica.

ttttttJESSICA (gently)
tttDon't be afraid.

We see that it is a little GIRL of seven. Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled.

<b>ttttttJESSICA
</b>tttWhat's your name?

<b>ttttttJESSICA
</b>tttWhen do you go up?

<b>ttttttMARY
</b>tttI never go upstairs. You're a
tttnice old lady.

As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's
clothing...tearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) off...and running away
swiftly.

As Jessica instinctively starts after her...Logan... holds her back.

<b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>ttttt(shaking his head)
tttNot here. Might be a decoy.

Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-

<b>125ttEXT. - CATHEDRAL ITSELF
</b>
An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings.

Logan crouches, holding the transceiver and fanning the area,
listening...

SOUND: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady.

Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him, and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING, quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog. Coming up to an angle of wall, he stops, flicks the sound off,
puts the machine back onto his belt. He gestures to Jessica to stand
still then he straightens, steps out, calls:

<b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttRunner!

Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is
shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off. The Runner is a woman!

There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps, grasping at him.t
<b>tt
</b>As Logan whirls:t
<b>tt
</b><b>125X1ttANOTHER ANGLEt
</b>
Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed. At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows. Logan makes a
futile gesture after her, then turns to face the Cubs.

A strutting, feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack, dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies. He gestures to one of his followers to stand still.

<b>ttttttBILLY 
</b>ttttt(speaking of the Runner) 
tttDon't worry about her. We'll have that 
tttone later. Right now I think we've got

There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.

blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned
building.

tttHe's trying to hold his breath...

As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logan's face:

With all his might, Logan wrenches his arms loose... drops to the
ground and pulls out his gun.

He fires and fire girdles a pillar...and they start to back away.

Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.

</b>tttCome on, Billy...cut me...Come on

After a beat, Billy turns and runs away.

Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns it...until it starts BEEPING.

The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica...following the SOUND.

They move over the rubble...and cautiously around abandoned
buildings.

We HEAR A SCREAM...and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and
attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction
than where the beeping is coming from.

<b>ttttttLOGAN

tttThey've got someone else! Why would

Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly.

The BEEPING is now very loud.

a door inside and kicks it down.

We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.

Slowly, she rises.

Logan takes out the ankh.

Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again.

During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again.

Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round

<b>144ttFULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUS
</b>
Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.

The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.

At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control thet
operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician
demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides.

next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM...as a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach.

CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces
and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points.

A vibrobeam begins to KEEN.

SOUND: An insistent chiming.

Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's
been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like
apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The
table and the laser heads stop moving.tt

Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan,
then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look
registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine
again...

<b>ttttttDOC
</b>tttPay attention, Sandman. I'm
tttproud of this machine.

As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logan's face. It pauses as

<b>ttttttDOC
</b>tttWith this one there's no waiting
tttfor scar burnishing. It's all in

The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a
bright trail of blood as

<b>ttttttDOC 
</b>tttBut here's the improvement. Instant 
ttthealing---before you feel a thing. 
tttWatch now...

Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,
spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole.

<b>144X2ttTHE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN t

</b>And the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into
Logan's new wound. Again the blood disappears.
<b>tt
</b>Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious. He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely. The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill. Holly looks alarmed.

and Doc falls back onto the Table.

pulls her down and the two struggle.

front against the glare. It's Holly.

She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the
bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side
and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall.

She reacts with fear at the sight.t

A long beat. Then--

hands reaching out to help her.

<b>ttttttVOICE 
</b>tttYou two. Just go straight ahead. 
tttFollow the corridors with the pipes

As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room, reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted, no face seen.
There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's
obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan
pauses.

wheels, pulling her with him.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttttLOGAN
</b>tttCome on then--they'll be here any

Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen,
led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.

watch, helplessly. Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them. He stares at Logan, unsure. Logan reacts, draws, fires. The
Sandman is smashed away, burning.

Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his

chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.

<b>212ttLOGAN AND JESSICA

As he pulls her shakily to her feet. She nods, she's okay. He leads
her off down the tunnel.

following the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but
always down.

</b>As Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch.

The tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door 
tands in a couple of inches of water.
<b>t
</b>With great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door. Logan
gives the wheel a tug...nothing.

SOUND: A WHIRRING like clockwork...A METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a

</b>tttRunner, this is the last gate. Usettt

SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds. Then it stopstand the light goes out.

<b>214X1tLOGAN AND JESSICAt

Hearing a SOUND they turn and see:
<b>t
</b><b>214X2tANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.
</b>
Far behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING

<b>215-216tCLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA
</b>
As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.

ttttttJESSICA (breathlessly) 
tttEvery key only works once...and only 
ttta Lastday key must open this door.... 
tttThey said it would fit - but....

She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the
dark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.
Then Logan remembers.

<b>ttttttLOGAN 
</b>tttWait - I have the one I took from 
tttthe Runner.

SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runner's ankh.

Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.

As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the
distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.

As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens.

There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.

As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:

<b>ttttttJESSICA
</b>tttThere's no turning back, is there?

Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...
as the door closes and they are:

<b>217ttON THE OTHER SIDEt
</b>
now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.

Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.

In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.

Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.

<b>217X1tWITH FRANCISt
</b>
As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.

But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing

Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way" and sets out.

(NOTE: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)

ttttttLOGAN (alert)t

Jessica nods, frightened. Logan slips off into the darkness. In a

<b>ttttttJESSICA
</b>tttIt's Francis, isn't it?

He nods.

<b>226ttLOGAN AND JESSICA
</b>
Trying to move faster now, Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back. But as they do so, Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly
seeming small and distant.

As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall,
suddenly:

</b>
looming huge, gun drawn, apparently only a few feet away.

is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see:

THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel. As the light passes, Logan
heaves desperately on it. It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed.

<b>230ttCLOSE - ON FRANCIS
</b>
aiming at Logan...then slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights.

<b>231ttLOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS 
</b>
Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND, ECHOING and RESOUNDING. One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything. Through it, Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through.

<b>232ttINT. - THE SHAFT t

A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes.

Moving at an extremely high speed...We can see the outside -
flickering - dark, light, - dark, light... and finally to a white
color. They lie slumped, motionless. Finally it stops. The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.

In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves. What little light there is
seems to come from the left. Arm around Jessica, Logan starts to
move.

I. On the third swing...Logan grabs hold of the steel pole and
swings around on it...kicking Francis in the chest.

J. Francis lets go of the steel pole as he staggers backward.
Francis and Logan look at one another for a brief anguished moment
as Logan crashes the steel pole (which he is now holding) down on
Francis' head.

K. Francis crumbles to the floor. Feebly, he raises a hand toward
Logan...

death off with the strong grip.

destruction.

The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.

People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the
exits, trampling  each other in their fright.

</b><b>X21ttPANIC MONTAGE SERIES OF CUTS
</b>
A. EXT. The City under the dome -- fitfully lit as the dome itself
seems to be cracking strange electrical discharges emanating from it
as from a gigantic line storm.

B. The lights in Arcade flicker and go dim.

C. The chandeliers in Arcade swaying, a couple falling onto the
screaming panicky people.

D. Maze-Car Station. People fighting to cram into cars. Car lights
go out. People turn and bolt in another direction.

E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each
other in fear, struggling to get away.

F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.

G. The great crystal -- a wildly spluttering electrical fire
wrecking it.

Making their way through Cathedral -- out the dazzle chamber,

<b>411tEXT. - CITY - FULL SHOT
</b>
The dome of the city torn. Lightning effects playing on the stunned
people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they
stumble forward into the darkness.

A wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. There
is a sense of wonder. Hysteria is lessening...as the people find
themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that
the crystals have disappeared from their palms.

Some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they
emerge from the crack in the dome at:

<b>412ttFULL ANGLE - THE ACRES OF STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION
</b><b>t
</b>We can still see the fires in the b.g. of the SHOT as Logan holds on
to Jessica...(like Gable onto Jeanette MacDonald at the end of SAN
FRANCISCO)...full of happiness and hope for the future.

AS people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped
construction...we see the Old Man WALKING INTO THE SHOT.

Logan and Jessica run to him. He looks around. People start to
gather...they have never seen a white-haired Old Man in their lives.

As people continue to gather around the Old Man... who couldn't be
more delighted...Logan and Jessica are smiling...inviting people to
touch him...and some do.

Yes, he is an old man...Yes, they will all live again to be old men
and old women...Yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.
