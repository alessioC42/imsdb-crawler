<b>tFRIDAY THE 13TH PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN
</b>
tWritten by Rob Hedden


<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT
</b>
tA dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float 
tacross it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into 
tview. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins. 
tAn abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. 

tWe continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound 
tof seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small 
tHOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light 
tflickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>
tA teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing. 
tJim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttWell...how do you feel?

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttAsk me in about five minutes.

tShe bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully..

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttI'm talking about graduation. Being 
tttotally free to do whatever we want 
ttnow.

tHer hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttIt feels excellent.

tHer mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently 
tpulls away from her with a teasing smile.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttGotta throw the anchor over.

tHe leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets.

<b>tEXT. HOUSEBOAT DECK - NIGHT
</b>
tas Jim tosses a small anchor overboard.

<b>tTIGHT ON WATER SURFACE
</b>
tas the weighty object splashes, sinking into black 
toblivion, pulling its cable down with it. 

<b>tJIM 
</b>
tglances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He 
tfeels a chill, heading back inside.

<b>tEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
</b>
tas the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few 
tfeet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake 
tsilt.

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>
tas Jim returns with an uneasy expression. He crawls on 
ttop of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same 
tenthusiasm as before.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttWhat's wrong?

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttNothing.

tHe starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses 
this anxiety.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttC'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering 
ttyou.

tJim pauses, turning off the mood music.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttIt's just that we're right around that 
ttold summer camp where all those 
ttmurders took place.

tThe boat creaks. She's instantly nervous.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttWhat murders?

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttNever mind, you don't want to know 
ttabout it.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttTell me.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttThere's nothing to worry about, Suzy. 
ttThe guy's dead now, somewhere at the 
ttbottom of this lake...if you believe 
ttthe stories.
ttt(beat)
ttLet's drop it, okay?

tHe starts to kiss her again. She stops him.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttWhat stories?

tHe doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttThere was this boy named Jason 
ttVoorhees who drowned in Crystal 
ttLake...

<b>tFLASHBACK
</b>
tEight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread 
twater, flailing his arms like a marionette to get 
tattention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water.

<b>ttttYOUNG JASON
</b>ttHhhhelp....me....I'm drowning...

<b>ttttJIM (V.O.)
</b>ttNone of the counselors heard him.

<b>ttttYOUNG JASON
</b>ttMmmmmmommy....

t...And Jason finally slips under the surface for good.

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttA bunch of years went by and everybody 
ttforgot about it.
ttt(beat)
ttThat's when the murders started.

<b>tFLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)
</b>
tas our senses are bombarded with QUICK CUTS of assorted

tteenagers just about to die, their screams echoing over 
teach other. We do not see the attacker. As the 
tcacophony reaches a screeching crescendo, CUT BACK TO:

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>
tas the silence hits us hard again.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttJason did it...?

<b>ttttJIM'
</b>ttThat's what some people thought. But 
ttthey were wrong.

<b>tFLASHBACK (STOCK)
</b>
tas MRS. VOORHEES comes directly at camera wielding a huge 
tknife and a primal scream.

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>
<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttHis mother blamed the counselors for 
tthis death and tried to kill them all.
ttt(dramatic pause)
ttShe got her head chopped off by one of 
ttthem.

tWe don't need to see this clip...Suzy's reaction is quite 
tsufficient.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttSo the murders stopped?

tHe gives her a long, penetrating look.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttNo.

<b>tFLASHBACK MONTAGE (STOCK)
</b>
tWe're bombarded with QUICK FLASHES of a hockey masked 
tJASON wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers...brandishing 
teverything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws. Just as 
tJason is about to stab us, CUT BACK TO:

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>
tSuzy flinches as if she were getting the knife.

<b>tttt
</b>
<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttLegend has it that Jason came back to 
ttavenge his mother's death, vowing to 
ttkill every teenager from the area. 
ttt(beat)
ttAnd every now and then, the murders 
ttstart up again. 

tThe boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable. 
tShe's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttForget about it, Suzy. They're just 
ttstories.

tHe brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently, 
tfinding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes, 
ttrying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't. 
tSuzy begins to rationalize.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttWe're the last graduating class, 
ttright? 

tJim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttI mean, Lakeview High just closed its 
ttdoors for good, right?

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttSo there's no reason for him to come 
ttback because there won't be any of us 
ttaround...right?

tJim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttRight. Except that Jason isn't real 
ttso none of it matters anyway.

tShe starts to relax, returning his kisses.

<b>tEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
</b>
tas the anchor drifts along the lake floor, tugging hard 
ton the power cable. Camera TRACKS along the cable, 
tcoming to a RUSTY SET OF CHAINS TANGLED AROUND IT.

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tas Jim slides on top of Suzy. Thoughts of Jason are 
tstarting to slip away along with their clothes.

<b>tEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
</b>
tas the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the 
ttugging anchor. Camera continues to TRACK again...and we 
tfind to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body 
tof JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS. (NOTE: Jason's 
tface is obscured.)

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tTeenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion. At 
tthe same moment:

<b>tEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
</b>
tThe anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE. 
tSPARKS INSTANTLY FLY, chasing along the cable, finding 
tthe chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN 
<b>tELECTRICITY.
</b>
<b>tEXT. HOUSEBOAT - ON LAKE SURFACE (EFX)
</b>
tas BRIGHT FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT strobe-under the surface. 
tARCING CURRENT chases up the anchor cable, sparking 
tacross the hoist.

<b>tEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - WIDE SHOT FROM WATER
</b>
tas the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly 
textinguished, plunging the campsite into darkness.

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tas Suzy's eyes flash open.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttDid you hear that?

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttHear what?

tHe pulls her back down.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttC'mon, I'm serious.

tHe knows the mood is broken.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttAll right, I'll check it out.

tHe slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the 
tsheet up around her fearfully.

<b>tEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)
</b>
tas the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to 
tfind the chains again...but they're dangling loosely. 
<b>tJASON IS GONE.
</b>
<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tSuzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void 
tof night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim 
thas left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttJimmy...?

tNo answer. Her heart starts to pound.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttJim...?

tAgain, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving 
ttowards the open door. The ship creaks again.

<b>tSUZY'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tas she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch-
tblack beyond it.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttStop screwing around, Jim. I mean 
ttit...

t...And just as she reaches the door:

<b>tA HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER
</b>
tleaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time 
tto scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST.

<b>tSUZY
</b>
tstands there in speechless shock, looking down at her 
tmortal wound. But there's no blood.

<b>tTHE MONSTER
</b>
tpulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out 
twith his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM 
tpulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it 
taside.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttGotcha good, baby cakes.

tShe doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick 
thim in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, 
tlaughing.

<b>tEXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK
</b>
tsitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A 
tSHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING 
tHAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling 
tit away.

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tas Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying 
tunsuccessfully to kiss her.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttAll right, all right -- I'm a major 
ttass.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttAnd you'll never do it again.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttAnd I'll never do it again. Forgive 
ttme?

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttNo.

tShe's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around 
thim, finally giving in.

<b>tEXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
</b>
tA deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the 
tcabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT.

<b>tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tThe sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each 
tother. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now.

<b>tANGLE - CABIN DOOR
</b>
tNothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered 
<b>tBARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME.
</b>
<b>tSUZY
</b>
tcloses her eyes with pleasure...

<b>tANGLE - CABIN DOOR
</b>
t...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless 
tlegs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked 
tface of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES.

<b>tSUZY 
</b>
tlets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay 
topen long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway. 
tShe tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just 
tcollapsed himself.

<b>ttttSUZY
</b>ttJJJJJJJJason...

tHe doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttUh-huh. You must really think I'm an 
ttass.

tBut she continues to stare in horror as:

<b>tJASON
</b>
traises the spear, taking aim.

<b>tANGLE - SUZY AND JIM  
</b>
tHs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood-
tcurdling SCREAM. A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR, 
<b>tPIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD.
</b>
tJim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able 
tto assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see 
tthe monster himself.

<b>ttttJIM
</b>ttOhmygod...

tJim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to 
tdefend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He 
tSMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim 
tscrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE 
<b>tAIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.
</b>
<b>tEXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT
</b>
tas the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward. The lone 
tsilhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm. 
tHe's back.

<b>ttttttt  FADE OUT/MAIN CREDITS.
</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. HARBOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY
</b>
tOnly the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a 
tthick blanket of gray fog. In the distance, speckled 
tlights outlining a smaller LUXURY CRUISE SHIP 
tintermittently appear.

<b>tEXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY
</b>
tStanding at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH, 
tclipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair 
tof new-agey SENIOR GIRLS. McCulloch is approaching fifty, 
twearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the 
tdisposition of a stern puritan.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttRemember girls, the shuffleboard 
tttournament will start at six p.m. 
ttsharp. A non-attendance will restrict 
ttyour time in port, understood?

tThey nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers 
tas they head up the ramp. Camera ADJUSTS to find a small 
tparking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are 
tjust now arriving -- parents dropping off their high 
tschool seniors, hugging them bon voyage.

<b>tCLOSER ANGLE PARKING LOT
</b>
tas SEAN ROBERTSON walks toward the ship with pal MILES 
tWOLFE. Sean's a tall, nice looking, somewhat serious guy; 
tMiles is shorter, athletic and more extroverted.

<b>ttttMILES
</b>ttYou're telling me this boat has a pool 
ttwith a three meter board?

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttIt's a ship and that's right. Plus a 
ttdisco, gym, game room and a lot more.

<b>ttttMILES
</b>ttI think I'm gonna blow off New York 
ttand just stay on this thing.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttYou'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe... 

tCamera ADJUSTS to reveal McCulloch, holding his list, 
tchecking off their names.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttYour itinerary has been carefully 
ttplanned and make no mistake, it will 
ttbe executed accordingly.

<b>ttttMILES
</b>ttt(under his breath)
ttOf course...wouldn't want to risk 
ttenjoying this trip.

tMcCulloch gives him a frown. Sean steps up to him 
ttentatively.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttWhich cabin is Rennie in, Mr. 
ttMcCulloch?

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttRennie's not coming.

tHe's devastated.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttBut I thought...

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttShe changed her mind.
ttt(eyeing list)
ttLet's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom 
ttone-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are 
ttin two-twenty-five.

tA booming VOICE from above interrupts them:

<b>ttttADMIRAL ROBERTSON (O.S.)
</b>ttSean -- where the hell have you been? 
ttWe're already into early departure 
ttprotocol...

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tStanding on the upper deck is a no-nonsense, uniformed 
tNavy man, ADMIRAL ROBERTSON. The captain of the ship. And 
tSean's father. Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is 
timmediately replaced with anxiety.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttBe right up, Dad.

tHe and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving 
tMcCulloch one last glare.

<b>tINT. '76 BMW 2002 - DAY
</b>
tBehind the wheel is MISS COLLEEN VAN DEUSEN, thirties, 
tattractive, a progressive attitude. RENNIE WICKHAM sits 
tnext to her -- she's seventeen, pretty, slightly 
twithdrawn. Rennie's dog TOBY, a border collie, rides in 
tthe back seat.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttI'm glad you decided to come after 
ttall.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttMe too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles 
ttwill be.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttYou let me worry about him, okay?
ttt(pause)
ttPersonal experiences are what fuel the 
ttminds of great writers, Rennie. You 
ttmade the right decision.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttWhat about not-so-great writers?

tRennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen 
tgrinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far 
tbetween, this one disappearing as she glances out the 
twindow.

<b>tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT)
</b>
tas the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread 
tout before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes 
tacross it occupied by two indistinguishable people.

<b>tRETURN TO SHOT
</b>
tRennie's eyes show a hidden terror. She quickly turns 
taway, shivering briefly. Miss Van Deusen notices. She 
tturns a corner, heading into the parking lot.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttEverything okay?

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttJust felt a little chill.

tRennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttDid you know that I'm giving up 
ttteaching?

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttReally?

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttSince the school is closing anyway, 
ttI'm going to write that novel I've 
ttbeen threatening on everybody.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttThat's wonderful, Miss Van 
ttDeusen...what's it about?

tShe parks the car, turning off the ignition.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttA senior class cruise to Manhattan, 
ttlaced with romance, adventure and 
ttmurder.
ttt(beat)
ttOr a Gothic cook book. I haven't 
ttdecided which.

tShe's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again. Miss Van 
tDeusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove 
tcompartment, handing it to Rennie, who seems utterly 
tsurprised.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttGo on, open it.

tRennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink-dip 
tpen.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttStephen King supposedly used it when 
tthe was in high school.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttI don't know what to say...

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttRennie, you're the best student I ever 
tthad...you have a real gift. If anybody 
ttcan make use of that pen, it's you.

tRennie hugs her teacher. Camera RISES above the car's 
twindow, finding a Mercedes 560 SL pulling in a short 
tdistance away.

<b>tCLOSER ANGLE - MERCEDES
</b>
tA sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel. TAMARA 
tMASON. She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of 
tSENIOR GIRLS walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and 
thellos. She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a 
tcute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda, 
<b>tEVA WATANABE.
</b>
<b>tttt. TAMARA
</b>ttAre you ready for drugs, sex and rock 
tt'n roll or what, girl?

tEva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left. 
tEva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a 
tsmile at Tamara.

<b>ttttMRS. WATANABE
</b>ttHello, Tamara.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttHi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.

<b>ttttMRS. WATANABE
</b>ttYes, I'm sure.

tEmbarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss 
tgoodbye.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttDon't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll 
tthave a terrific time and I won't do 
ttanything stupid, okay?

tBefore Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter 
tis gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.

<b>ttttMRS. WATANABE
</b>ttI love you...

<b>tTRACKING WITH TAMARA AND EVA
</b>
tOnce they're out of Mrs. Watanabe's earshot --

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttI hear the crew members are cute guys 
ttin their twenties.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttReally?

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttI'm sure we'll have no problem getting 
ttthem to party with us...especially 
ttwith this.

tTamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with 
tfine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttIt's my graduation gift from Daddy. It 
ttcost over a thousand bucks but it's 
ttthe best.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttHe bought you that?

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttMore or less. It's part of my college 
ttfund.

<b>tttt
</b>
tShe grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the 
tcalm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT 
tis aimlessly drifting into port.

<b>tCLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT
</b>
tSure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last 
tnight...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a 
tghost ship.

<b>tEXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY
</b>
tas Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another 
tpair of seniors.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttYou can stop right there, Miss Mason.

tHe motions the others onward. Busted. Tamara instantly 
thands Eva her drug-filled purse, paralyzing Eva.

<b>ttttMCCULL40CH
</b>ttOnly graduating seniors are allowed on 
ttthis cruise.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

<b>ttttMCCULLOCB
</b>ttYou never turned in your final biology 
ttproject, so I've had your diploma 
ttrescinded.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttYou can't do that...

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttIt's already been done.
ttt(turning to Eva)
ttCongratulations on the 3.9 average, 
ttMiss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two-
ttfifty-five.

tEva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling 
tto see what happens with Tamara.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttLook, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car 
ttaccident yesterday and missed our 
ttappointment. It's okay, no big deal, 
ttjust a bruised arm...
ttt(squeezes her arm)
tt...so I brought my project along 
tttoday. It's in my suitcase. Really.

tHe looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttShe's telling the truth, Mr. 
ttMcCulloch. I saw her pack it.

tHe's surprised to hear this...and so is Tamara.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttAll right. But if it mysteriously 
ttdisappears en route, I'll have you 
ttsent back home the minute we dock. 
ttUnderstood?

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttPerfectly.

tShe grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on 
tbefore he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.

<b>ttttTAMARA  
</b>ttA major prick.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttWhat are you going to do?

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttImprovise, of course.

<b>tEXT. DOCK PILINGS - SAME TIME  
</b>
tas the HOUSEBOAT haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered 
tdock pilings, still around fifty yards from the cruise 
tship.

<b>tPOINT OF VIEW OUT HOUSEBOAT WINDOW
</b>
tThe window is splattered with blood, but still clear 
tenough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway, 
talong with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on 
tboard.

<b>tTIGHT ON HOUSEBOAT'S ANCHOR CABLE
</b>
t--or rather the remnants of it. It's a piece of frayed 
twoven metal charred by extreme electricity, severed just 
tabove water level. Suddenly there's blurry movement 
tbehind it; camera RACK FOCUSES just in time to catch a 
tglimpse of JASON SLIPPING OFF THE SIDE, FLOATING TOWARDS 
<b>tTHE PILINGS.
</b>
<b>tEXT. DOCKSIDE - SAME TIME
</b>
tas McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again. 
tMiss Van Deusen walks up to him.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttHello, Charles. Has everyone checked 
ttin?

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttJim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never 
ttshowed up. I'm a little concerned.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttDon't be. They probably decided to 
ttexplore each other rather than New 
ttYork.

tHe gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp. 

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttLet's go -- we're running two minutes 
ttlate.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttCharles, there's someone else coming 
ttalong too.

tHe stops, following her glance. His face tightens.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tRennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her 
tdog Toby striding next to her. She walks up to him, 
tstarts to say something, then decides against it. Rennie 
theads up the gangway. HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van 
tDeusen. He's livid.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttYou have no right...

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttAnd neither do you. It's up to Rennie
ttto decide what she wants to do.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttShe doesn't know what she wants. She's 
ttnever had a stable life.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttAnd she sure doesn't have one now, 
tteither. She needs to live.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttI'm her legal guardian, not you or 
ttanybody else, and I alone know what's 
ttbest for her. End of discussion.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttNo, I think it's just the beginning.

tShe walks past him.

<b>tEXT. RAMP/SHIP - ON RENNIE
</b>
tas she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart 
tpounding. Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look 
tout at the lake again.

</b>
tThe ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there, even closer 
tnow.

<b>tRENNIE'S PUPILS
</b>
tcontract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a 
<b>tFAINT VOICE BELOW HER...
</b>
<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttHhhhelp me...

tRennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and 
tsees:

<b>tAN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY 
</b>
tfloundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to 
trecognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking 
tin huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the 
tprologue.

<b>ttttYOUNG JASON
</b>ttHhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tleans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttWhat's wrong, Rennie??

tRennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to 
tspeak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees:

<b>tMISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tThe water is calm. No Young Jason.

<b>tRETURN TO SHOT
</b>
tas Rennie gets a hold of herself.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttI just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.

tShe continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, 
twatching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to 
tMcCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tcontinues along the starboard side, not risking another 
tglance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK 
tHAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes 
tfollowing her like a crazed raven.

<b>tINT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY
</b>
tSharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged 
tscaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to 
treveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the 
tcruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF 
tENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA 
tsatellite computer as well as the LORAN.

</b>ttt(checking watch)

</b>ttYes Sir.

ttTake in the gangway and single up all

</b>ttHello, Dad.

<b>ttttMILES
</b>ttHey, Admiral Robertson. Love your

</b>ttShe's a beauty, isn't she? I should've 
ttretired from the Navy ten years ago.

<b>ttttMILES
</b>ttYou've really been generous to give us 
ttthis cruise. I know I speak for 
tteverybody on board.

tEverybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He 
tavoids eye contact with his father.

</b>

ttt(beat)
ttBy the way, congratulations on winning 
ttthe intramural diving championships, 
ttMiles. I'm sure you made your old man 
ttproud.

tAdmiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean 
tshould think about doing the same.

<b>ttttCHIEF ENGINEER
</b>ttHave you decided on your departure 
ttprotocol, Admiral?

<b>ttttADMIRAL ROBERTSON
</b>ttActually, I thought I'd leave the

</b>ttt(to Chief Engineer, ignoring

ttRelinquishing command of the Princess

tSean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his 
tfriend's nervousness as well.

<b>ttttADMIRAL ROBERTSON
</b>ttBut before you take the helm, take 
ttthis.

tHe tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a 
tnavigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting 
tnext to a rusty old sextant.

<b>ttttADMIRAL ROBERTSON
</b>ttSomething old and something new. I 
ttused the sextant when I was your age, 
ttbut now they have these goddamn 
ttcomputers to do all the work for you.

<b>ttttCHIEF ENGINEER
</b>ttt(to Sean)
ttHave you decided on a plan of 
ttdeparture, Captain?

tSean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at 
tthe LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttHow about if we start up the forward 
ttengines and come around. 180 
ttdegrees...

<b>ttttADMIRAL ROBERTSON
</b>ttAren't you forgetting something?

tSean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a 
tlarge button, pressing it three times, piercing the air 
twith three long blasts of the ship's horn. It 
tunderscores his frustration.

<b>ttttADMIRAL ROBERTSON
</b>ttWe're in foggy weather! Send out the 
ttinternational maritime signal that a 
ttvessel is backing down, followed by a 
ttsecurity broadcast warning other 
ttships!

tHe shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, 
tleaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment 
tfor Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits 
tas well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, 
tsaddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this 
tway.

<b>tEXT. DECK - ON SEAN
</b>
tas he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK 
tHAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at 
tSean.

<b>ttttDECK HAND
</b>ttThis voyage is doomed.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttYeah, tell me about it.

tSean sidesteps him, moving on.

<b>tEXT. HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT)
</b>
tParents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as 
tCAMERA RISES AND ROTATES to find eighteen or so teenagers 
t1ining the upper deck, happily waving back. The ship 
tbegins to slice through serene water. The voyage has 
tbegun.

<b>tCLOSER ON HULL
</b>
tThe water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases. 
tAll seems normal...until JASON'S HANDS APPEAR, CLINGING 
tTO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER. He 
tslithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog 
tbreezes past him.

<b>tEXT. DECK - DAY
</b>
tas Sean continues along, hands in pockets. He turns a 
tcorner and collides with RENNIE, walking her dog. His 
teyes instantly brighten, as do hers.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttRennie...

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttHi, Sean.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttI heard you weren't coming.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttt(glances at Toby)
ttWe changed our minds.

tSean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause...they are 
tobviously in the early stages-of a relationship. 
tSean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small 
tnecklace-sized box.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttI got you a present.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttBut I didn't get you one...

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttForget it. It's a dumb little thing 
ttanyway.

tRennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace 
twith a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttSean...it's beautiful.

tSean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttI thought maybe we could hike to the 
tttop of the Statue when we got there, 
ttif you felt like it. It's supposed to 
ttbe 22 stories tall.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttI'd love to.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH (O.S.)
</b>ttYour father was looking for you, Mr. 
ttRobertson.

tMcCulloch appears behind them. The mood has been broken.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttI guess I'll see you later.

tSean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out 
tto the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she 
tpsyches herself up to look.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttThere's a storm predicted tonight. 

tRennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn 
taway.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttYou're making a big mistake, Rennie. 
ttIt's not too late to put you back on 
ttland.

</b>ttI'm staying.

</b>ttWhy are you doing this to yourself?

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttI don't even know why I'm afraid, 
ttUncle Charles. I can't even remember 
ttwhen it started. Don't you think it's

tHe takes a measured pause.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttFacing your fear doesn't always 
ttconquer it.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttI'm staying.

tHe's not going to change her mind.

<b>tP.O.V. - RENNIE AND MCCULLOCH (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
</b>
tthrough a porthole window...and through the viewfinder 
tof a video camcorder. McCulloch shakes his head, turning 
taway from Rennie and walking away. A sinister electric 
tguitar solo screeches out. PAN with McCulloch as he 
tpasses the window, coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE 
tUP of J.J. JARRETT, fingering a sleek Gibson "Flying V."

<b>ttttJ.J.
</b>ttt(into camera)
ttIs this axe awesome or what?

<b>tINT. J.J.'S STATEROOM - DAY
</b>
tas J.J., a female rocker in the vein of band "Vixen," 
tcontinues to wail on her guitar. She's wearing a black 
tleather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. Holding 
tthe camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER, MTV-acclimated, wearing 
tthe latest hip prescription glasses.

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttToo cool, J.J. Your parents came 
ttthrough.

tShe pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.

<b>ttttJ.J.
</b>ttNo lie. I hear there's a big power 
ttroom down below where I can get 
ttsupreme concert hall echo. Come down 
ttand shoot a basement tape on me, okay?

</b>ttSure...but I gotta shoot some

tHe avoids eye contact when he says it. She gives him a 
tlook.

<b>ttttJ.J.
</b>ttMan, don't tell me you're still trying 
ttto scam on Tamara...

tHis non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him, 
tgrabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.

<b>ttttJ.J.
</b>ttHow long have we known each other? 
ttDon't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not 
ttinterested in you, only what you can 
ttdo for her. She's a user.

<b>ttttJ.J.
</b>ttSo's this guitar. So what?

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttI'll catch you later.

tHe exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling 
tup her amp cord.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE
</b>
tas he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he 
tpasses a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY 
tFOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS 
tthe footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition, 
tour eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not 
tfor long.

<b>tINT. POWER ROOM - DAY
</b>
tMassive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of 
tpipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers 
tand voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming 
tgenerators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her 
tguitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the 
tsurroundings.

<b>ttttJ.J.
</b>ttThis place is aching for a video. 
ttWayne, you're an asshole.

tShe finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment.

<b>tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tWe're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam, 
tmoving through it, behind the generators.

<b>tJ.J.
</b>
tpops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the "play" 
tbutton. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out.

<b>tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tmoving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather 
tpants as she bends over to plug in her axe.

<b>tTIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR
</b>
tas J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female. 
treceptacle.

</b>
tappears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes.
<b>tttt
</b><b>tJ.J.
</b>
tscreams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with 
ther playback. The generators are causing a breeze which 
tmakes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs. 
tShe's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending 
tthe high "E" string above the upper octave fret. She 
topens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees:

<b>tJASON
</b>
temerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.

<b>tEXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME
</b>
tas J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to 
tfind the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it, 
treacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it.

<b>tINT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
tas Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the 
tair like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a 
tnarrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a 
tgenerator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one 
tlast look at her before:

<b>tJASON
</b>
tswings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.

<b>tEXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME
</b>
tas the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of 
ther demise, followed by discordant feedback from her 
tguitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast 
tpocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of 
tEarly Times.

<b>tEXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (EFX)
</b>
tas LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is 
timminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting 
tthrough whitecaps, no land in sight.

<b>tCLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN
</b>
tas Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving 
tto a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several 
tbeats.

<b>tINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tNo inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her 
tdog, who's curled up on the bed.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttWhat do you think...time for some 
ttpersonal experiences to fuel our 
ttminds?

tThe dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttI agree.

tRennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and 
tsome black satin pants.

tempty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's 
twindow. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at 
tthe backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt, 
tslipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the 
ttiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby 
tand the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF 
tRENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright, 
tfacing us point-blank, and:

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE
</b>
tNobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's 
tsomething surreal about the window...

<b>tTIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX)
</b>
tEmpty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM 
tBELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has 
tbecome a window into the depths of Crystal Lake.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tfeels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:

<b>tDOG TOBY
</b>
tbegins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door, 
tscratching to get out.

<b>tRENNIE'S EYES
</b>
tare distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back 
tat the porthole, she sees:

<b>tAN EMPTY WINDOW
</b>
tNo water, no drowning boy.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tsnaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is 
tfrantically clawing with his fur up.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttOkay Toby, calm down...

tShe's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie 
tcloses the curtains on her window, then steps to her 
tdoor. She swings the door open for Toby...and exposes 
tan empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room, 
tdashing off down the hall, snarling.

<b>tINT. SHIP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

trushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA 
tand EVA, disappearing down a staircase.

<b>tINT. MENS GYM - DAY
</b>
tA strong seventeen year-old black kid, JULIUS GAW, is 
tgoing a few rounds with another senior boy who's clearly 
tlosing the boxing match. Julius dances around him on the 
tmat like he's Mike Tyson, several other boys cheering 
tthem on.

tfeeling out of place in the men's locker room.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttI'm not sure we're supposed to be

tA couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But 
tTamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against 
tthe glass, watching Julius.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttIs that a muscular bod or what?

tTamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her 
tinstead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a 
tleft-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud. 
tJulius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked 
tsmile.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttHe's undefeated, you know that?
ttt(beat)
ttJulius is the only senior I'd even 
ttconsider doing it with. If he wasn't

</b>ttMy stepmom couldn't care less, but

tTamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting 
tsomething.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttGorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look

tBoth girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in 
this mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very 
tmasculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara 
tturns around to check out his back side.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttI think it's time for some

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttYou're joking, right?

tShe wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was. Tamara 
twalks on, Eva following.

<b>tINT. STATEROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tas McCulloch steps from Rennie's room, looking very 
tworried. Wayne Webber passes by, his eye stuck in his 
tviewfinder. McCulloch yanks the camcorder away from his 
tface.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttHave you seen my niece anywhere?

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttYeah, motivating downstairs, I think. 
ttWhat's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?

tas Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttIs that unbelievable or what?

tTamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line. 
tBut the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING 
tFOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with 
tfear as:

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tappears from the shadows, just as startled to see them. 
tIt's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttI have her in Creative Writing and 
ttshe's fairly nice.

tTamara puts the straw to her nose.

</b>
tas she presses on, the corridor getting darker.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttToby?

tNo reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway... 
tbut camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON 
tREVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM. 
tHe's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in 
thalf, providing a splintery sharp shaft.

</b>ttDo you think I would use drugs, Mr.

tas a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool. 
tIt's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high 
tboard. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttPoetry in motion, Miles.

<b>ttttMILES
</b>ttA half-twist short. I'll hone that 
ttdive yet.

tHe swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie. 
tShe's very cautious about getting too close to the pool 
tedge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttRennie -- I was just on my way over to 
ttyour room

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttHave you seen my dog anywhere?

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttNo, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The

tShe smiles reassuringly, but her words are less than

<b>tTOBY'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)
</b>
tLow to the ground, creeping past a steam vent which 
tobscures his vision, then turning down a metal staircase, 
tweaving into another passageway. Then with absolutely no 
twarning, A BODY FALLS FROM ABOVE, THUDDING DIRECTLY IN 
<b>tFRONT OF US.
</b>
<b>tTOBY
</b>
trears back with teeth bared, but:

<b>tTHE BODY
</b>
tis quite dead: Toby is snarling at the corpse of the

ttThere's something I haven't told

</b>
tspins around, seeing Tamara standing there with Eva.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttWow, sorry...

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tflounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror 
tshe's experiencing. She's too scared to even cry for

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttWhy on earth would you do something

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttIt was an accident, I swear...

tEva avoids eye contact, feeling awful. Sean comes walking 
tup, seeing Rennie.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttWhat happened?
ttt(to Rennie)
ttRennie, are you okay?

<b>tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tShe's can't even hear Sean, her vision being splashed by 
tthe chlorinated water. She sinks under the surface, 
tturning around...AND COMING FACE TO FACE WITH YOUNG 
tJASON. The eight year-old corpse GRABS HER ANKLE AND

</b>
<b>tSEAN'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tas Rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing 
tin terror.

</b>

tSean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around. 
tMiss Van Deusen looks up at them.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttShe's fine -- everybody go back to

tThey disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight 
tto her teacher.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttCare to talk about it?

tAfter a moment to compose herself...

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttI can't swim.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttI gathered that.

tRennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's 
tholding out.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttI had a skiing accident in high

ttthree winters before I would even look 
ttat the snow again...but the solution 
ttkept eluding me.

ttbroken a bone since.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttIt's not that simple.

</b>ttMaybe not. But you're not telling me 
tteverything, are you?

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttt(long pause)
ttWhenever I get near the water, I see 
ttthis young boy drowning. He tries to 
ttpull me down with him.

tThe teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful 
tpause.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttWhen did this start?

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttAbout four years ago...at Crystal 
ttLake. I spent a few summers there with 
ttUncle Charles inbetween boarding 
ttschool.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttAfter your parents passed away?

tRennie nods somberly.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttDid you have an accident in the lake?

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttNo. It was just a normal summer. I've 
ttnever been able to figure it out.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttOnly one young boy ever drowned in 
ttthat lake, and that was before you 
ttwere even born. His name was Jason 
ttVoorhees.

tThe name has triggered some deep memory...but the 
trecollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's 
tvoice.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH (O.S.)
</b>ttDear God...

</b>
tas McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's 
tsoaked. He's livid.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttShe's fine, Charles. Take it easy...

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttOh, I can see that. You've done a 
ttwonderful job of supervising the kids, 
ttMiss Van Deusen.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttIt wasn't her fault.

tHe gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a 
ttowel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around 
this niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttStay away from her...both of you.

tHe starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks 
ttheir path, slipping his flask away.

<b>ttttDECK HAND
</b>ttHe's come back and you're all going to 
ttdie.

tRennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttJust...leave me alone...

tShe pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and 
tfrightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with 
tscorn. He checks his watch, then storms off.

tas a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes 
ta sultry voice...

<b>ttttTAMARA (O.S.)

</b>ttI'm in no mood for any more stall

tas Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle 
tof Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttWouldn't you like a glass of champagne 
ttfirst, Charles?

tHe's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttWhere did you get that alcohol?

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttI packed it. Just for us.

tas McCulloch takes the bottle from her, setting it down 
ton her nightstand.

</b>ttThat's it. You're not setting foot off 
ttthis ship until we return home.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttBut I haven't even shown you my

tTamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as 
tit softly piles at her bare feet.

<b>tANGLE - PORTHOLE WINDOW
</b>
tas the SHADOW OUTSIDE quickly blurs past the window.

<b>tRETURN TO SCENE
</b>
tMcCulloch is flabbergasted, too stunned to fully react. 
tTamara is wearing a layered teddy, which she's beginning 
tto unsnap, exposing her lithe body...but that's not all. 
tTamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttTake a closer look, Charles. I want to 
ttmake sure I labeled all my organs 
ttcorrectly.

tMcCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see 
tTamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips 
ton his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly 
tstarched shirt.

<b>tINT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tas she holds him tight. He finally breaks away in a fit 
tof anger.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttOh, you've done it now. Not only are 
ttyou going home, I'll see to it that 
ttyou spend next year back in a high

tHe storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to

</b>
twho casually lowers his camcorder.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttI don't think so, Mr. McCulloch.
ttt(to Wayne)
ttDid you get anything good?

tHis eyes are unable to leave her nakedness.

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttOh yeah.

tShe quickly slips on her robe again, all business. 
tMcCulloch realizes what has just transpired.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttYou'll never get away with it.
ttt(eyeing Wayne)
ttAnd you can forget about ever 
ttattending any film school.
ttt(serious beat)
ttYou're both going to be very, very

tHe storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara 
tsteps over to him, cuddling up.

<b>ttttTAMARA
</b>ttRelax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a 
ttthing.
ttt(beat)
ttCan I have the tape?

tHe pops the eject button, absently handing it over. Wayne 
tsteps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. He 
tlifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch.

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttThis is going to sound supremely 
ttlame...but I've had the major hots for 
ttyou since our sophomore year, Tamara.

tHe gulps down the fizz. She forces a smile, stashing the 
tincriminating videotape.

</b>ttThat's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to

ttt(ushering him to door)
ttLet's try to get together later, okey-

</b>ttBut I thought...

</b>ttThanks for the camerawork.

tAnd out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands 
toutside her room, realizing he's a major chump.

</b>ttWayne, you're an asshole.

tHe despondently exits.

tNothing is there.

tas Rennie enters, her eyes reddened. She moves to the 
tsink, looking at herself in the mirror. So much for the 
tsilk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked 
thair. Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face.

tWhen she starts to fill her hands a second time, BLOOD 
tPOURS OUT THE FAUCET INSTEAD OF WATER. Rennie gasps, 
tjerking up and seeing YOUNG JASON REFLECTED ON THE OTHER

tShe steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror

tJust as she SCREAMS:

</b>ttA tremendous age. Take some advice 
ttfrom a salty old man: don't push him 
tttoo hard.

tThe Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the 
tAdmiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck, 
tcontemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the 
tradio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in 
ta three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE.

<b>ttttCHIEF ENGINEER
</b>ttThis is the bridge. Approaching

tHis mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he 
tstares into the face of:

</b>
tholding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it 
tforward with one more staccato jerk and:

t-- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through 
this once-white uniform.

</b>ttBetter have them doublecheck the

<b>tSEAN'S POINT OF VIEW

tabout two feet away from him...

</b>
treaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his

</b>ttIs your ship equipped with Omega

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttYes...

<b>ttttRADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.)
</b>ttThe LORAN has a digital printout of

tSean hurries to the LORAN, reading the numbers.

<b>tEXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA - SAME TIME (EFX)
</b>
tas LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera 
tslowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second 
tlater, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP.

<b>tINT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME
</b>

this spitless mouth.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttI've got the numbers.

</b>ttGive me the degrees first, followed by

tSuddenly his voice is CUT OFF, followed by STATIC.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttHello? Are you there??

tNo response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat.

<b>tEXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA
</b>
tas Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching 
tonward.

<b>tEXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
</b>
tas McCulloch bursts onto the bridge, followed by Miss Van 
tDeusen.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttI demand to know what is going on...

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttOh dear God...

tShe's seen the bodies. McCulloch follows her glance, 
tpaling. He quickly takes charge, pushing through the 
tstudents.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttWhere's the radio?

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttIt's...dead.

<b>ttttDECK HAND (O.S.)
</b>ttYou're all going to die.

<b>ttttDECK HAND
</b>ttYou're the last ones. He's come back 
ttfor you.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

tThe Deck Hand takes a final swig from his flask, dropping 
tit with unsteady hands.

<b>ttttDECK HAND
</b>ttJason Voorhees.

tThere is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by 
tthe infamous name.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCHt 
</b>ttYou're insane, old man. Jason Voorhees 
tthas been dead for over thirty years.

<b>ttttDECK HAND
</b>ttHe walks this ship, here and now.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttA killer walks this ship indeed. And 
ttit's certainly none of us...

tThe crazed old man gets his drift. Everyone looks at him 
tsuspiciously. McCulloch grabs a SCALING KNIFE off the 
twall, taking a step towards him.

<b>ttttDECK HAND
</b>ttYou're the one who's insane!!

tThe raving man flees back the way he came. McCulloch 
traises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's 
tarm, stopping him.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttWhat are you doing??

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttThat lunatic has been spouting off

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttYeah, well these dead bodies are sure

ttt(to the others)
ttI say we regroup and find this

tThere's a murmur; it makes sense.

</b>ttYou'll do no.such thing and watch your

tThey all look at McCulloch defiantly.

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttSchool's out, McCulloch.
ttt(to the others)
ttLet's go.

tJulius walks off the bridge; all the seniors follow 
texcept Sean.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttPlease everybody, stay here!!

tThey don't listen. McCulloch starts to go after 
tthem...and then it hits him:

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttChrist...where's Rennie??

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttShe's...she's dropping the anchors. I 
ttthought the Coast Guard could find us 
tteasier if...

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttWhat?? You sent her out there with a 
ttmurderer running around loose??

<b>tEXT. DECK - NIGHT
</b>
tas Rennie moves past wet, empty lounge chairs towards the 
tbow. She passes a row of translucent windows. The first 
tthree are normal...but the fourth has the SILHOUETTE OF 
<b>tJASON ON ITS OPPOSITE SIDE. 
</b>tHe begins to stride parallel to her, then disappears 
twhen the windows end and a wall takes over.

<b>tINT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
tas Julius and his followers continue on, passing Eva, 
twho's coming up from a staircase. She stops Wayne.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttWhat's going on? I heard on the P.A. 
ttsystem that...

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttThe Captain's been murdered. The buzz 
ttis that Jason might be on board.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttJason...Voorhees?

tShe knows the legend as weld as everybody else. Wayne 
tnods gravely, moving to catch up with the others. Eva 
trushes up to him again.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttHave you seen Tamara?

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttNo. And I'm not losing any sleep over 
ttit.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttBut she might be in trouble...

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttSo what else is new?
ttt(beat)
ttLook Eva, you're asking the wrong dude 
ttto feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise 
ttup -- it's not hip to be her friend.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttI don't care about being hip anymore.

tShe means it. Wayne nods with understanding.

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttI'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.

tHe hurries on.

<b>tEXT. BOW - NIGHT
</b>
tas Rennie appears, fighting the wind and rain to get 
tcloser to the anchor hoists.

</b>
t--spying on Rennie like a wolf watching a lamb. We MOVE a 
tfew windows down, getting a better view of her.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE - ON JASON
</b>
tdeciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves 
tto the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling 
tit open.

<b>tEXT. BOW - ON RENNIE
</b>
tmoving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us 
tas well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at 
tthe consoles. Then suddenly a BARK.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttToby?

tShe turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the 
tside of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after 
tToby.

<b>tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tthrough the crack in the door, watching Rennie 
tunexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when 
tha hears:

<b>ttttEVA (O.S.)
</b>ttTamara? Are you around here anywhere?

tJason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH EVA
</b>
tas she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every 
talcove.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttTamara?

tmoving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva 
tbefore she turns a corner and disappears.

<b>tINT. HALLWAY/TAMARA'S STATEROOM - MOVING WITH EVA 
</b><b>t(STEADICAM)
</b>
tEva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom. 
tShe walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings 
topen, unlocked.

<b>ttttEVA
</b>ttTamara?
ttt(no response)
ttI just want to talk with you.

tShe steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The 
tquarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused 
tand scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND 
tcauses her to look back at:

<b>tTHE BATHROOM DOOR
</b>
tIt slowly swings open...splashing Eva's eyes with 
tgrotesque multi-images of Tamara: SHE IS HANGING ON THE 
<b>tDOOR HOOK, HER BODY PIN-CUSHIONED WITH A DOZEN MIRROR 
</b><b>tSRARDS.
</b>
<b>tEVA
</b>
tshrieks, running back out the door...

<b>tINT. STATEROOM HALLWAY
</b>
t...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING 
tAT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a 
tbulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat.

<b>tRUNNING WITH EVA (HAND HELD)
</b>
tGasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she 
tflees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral 
tstaircase and running on.

<b>tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM)
</b>
tchasing after her with the smooth determination of a 
tshark, never letting her get too far in the lead.

<b>tINT. BOWELS OF SHIP - ON EVA
</b>
tEmpty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way 
tthrough a maze of corridors and passageways. She races 
tpast a sign directing passengers to "CLUB RUBY."

<b>tANGLE - JASON
</b>
t--entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in 
tthe direction of the disco. He tramples onward.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR/DISCO (STEADICAM)
</b>
tThe thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune 
tprecedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the 
tcorridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward, 
tcurving through the shallow passageway and emptying out 
tonto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars 
tlighting system assaults her all directions along with 
tthe music. She's all alone in here.

<b>tTIGHT ON EVA
</b>
tThe lights strobing across her face only accentuate her 
tterror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing 
tto it. It's locked.

<b>tCROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR
</b>
tas Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT 
<b>tBEHIND HIM.
</b>
<b>tEVA
</b>
tdecides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the 
tcorridor again and:

<b>tJASON
</b>
tappears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The 
tspotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's 
tgone.

<b>tEVA
</b>
tbacks away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor 
tlike she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror 
tballs fondle her body as she moves as far away from the 
tpoint where she last saw him. But:

<b>tJASON
</b>
tilluminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe 
tassaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course 
twith him.

<b>tEVA  
</b>
twhirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the 
tsight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs, 
tPUSHING IN on her face.

<b>tEVA'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tspiraling counter-clockwise on the dance floor, flashes 
tof Jason materializing where she least expects to see 
thim. And getting closer. Finally at the point of 
texhaustion:

<b>tEVA
</b>
tstops, looking everywhere.

<b>tEVA'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tHe seems to be gone. She catches her breath...then 
tsensing his presence, she revolves a half-turn to face:

<b>tTHE HOCKEY MASK
</b>
texploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly 
tbefore her. His forearms recoil with lightning speed as 
the grips her throat...

<b>tWIDE SHOT - DISCO
</b>
tThundering music. Frantic lights. And Jason and Eva at 
tthe center of it all. HER FEET ARE TWENTY-FOUR INCHES OFF 
<b>tTHE GROUND, KICKING MADLY AS THE LIFE IS BEING CHOKED OUT 
</b>tOF HER. Finally Eva's legs go rag doll limp. Jason flings 
ther to the ground like a sack of flour. This dance is 
tover.

<b>tEXT. DECK - NIGHT
</b>
tRennie appears again, scanning her no-visibility 
tsurroundings.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttToby? Where'd you go?

tNo sign of her dog. She remembers her mission, heading to 
tthe anchors again.

<b>tEXT. BOW - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tas Rennie arrives on the bow, climbing into the left 
thoist box behind the huge anchor cable.

<b>tSTALKING POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tmoving up to the bow door like Jason did before, cracking 
tit open, seeing Rennie from behind. And moving towards 
ther.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tis oblivious as she reads the directions above the 
tcontrols.

<b>tINSERT - HOIST LEVER (SECOND UNIT)
</b>
tas Rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward.

<b>tINSERT - GREEN HOIST BUTTON (SECOND UNIT)
</b>
tA moment later, her thumb finds it and depresses it.

<b>tINSERT - ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)
</b>
tas the massive black chain links thunder to life.

<b>tSTALKING POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tHe's now within ten feet of the unaware girl.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tremains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating 
tcorrectly. A second later, we see the fleeting outline of 
ta HUMAN SHAPE appear behind her.

<b>tSTALKING POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tThree feet from Rennie. She spins around to climb out of 
tthe hoist box and GASPS.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE
</b>
tShe's facing MCCULLOCH. He immediately reaches past her, 
tyanking the lever back to its center position, and:

<b>tTHE ANCHOR CHAIN (SECOND UNIT)
</b>
tgrinds to a halt.

<b>tRETURN TO SHOT
</b>
tas McCulloch faces her, angrily grabbing Rennie's arms, 
tshouting over the storm.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttYou had me worried to death!

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttBut Sean said...

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttI'm the one you should be listening 
ttto! Do you think dropping an anchor in 
ttthe middle of a storm makes any sense 
ttwhatsoever?

tShe tries to find some defense, but McCulloch leads her 
toff before any wards come forth.

<b>tCLOSE UP - EXERCISE MAT
</b>
tas a pair of SKEET RIFLES, three FIRE AXES, a FLARE GUN 
tand several POOL CUES are dumped onto the foam padded 
tplastic.

<b>tINT. EXERCISE ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
twhere Julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes, 
tincluding Miles and Wayne.

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttI managed to scrounge this shit from 
ttthe game room and hallways. Grab what 
ttyou want.

tWayne takes one of the rifles; Miles grabs the axe.

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttWhat are you taking, Julius?

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttt(flexes fists)
ttNothin'.

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttt(dead serious)
ttWe're talking the possibility of Jason 
ttVoorhees here.

tJulius pauses. He's not stupid.

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttNothin' but this gun.

tHe reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they 
tmove.

<b>tINT. STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tas McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging 
ther door open.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttCan't we at least talk about it?

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttI refuse to discuss this ridiculous 
ttnotion that a ghoul is terrorizing 
ttthis ship.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttBut what about the drowning boy I've 
ttbeen seeing?

tHe avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering 
ther across the threshold. She's standing inside her room 
tnow; he's in the hallway.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttWhatever you've been...imagining... 
tthas nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.
ttt(pause)
ttI want you to be safe, Rennie. That's 
ttall I care about.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttI'm not staying in my room, Uncle 
ttCharles.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttThis isn't a request.

tHe closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, 
tlocking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other 
tside.

<b>ttttRENNIE (O.S.)
</b>ttUncle Charles!

tHe ignores her, briskly walking away.

<b>tINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
tas she throws her fists against the door a final time, 
trealizing it's futile.

<b>tINT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tSteam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing 
tpipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding 
tthe skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his 
tvideo camera to guide him.

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttJ.J. -- you down here?

<b>tCLOSER ANGLE
</b>
tas Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the 
tprecarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares 
tthe crap out of him, causing him to stumble.

<b>tINSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT)
</b>
t--They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down 
tthrough the catwalk and pipes to God knows where.

<b>tWAYNE
</b>
tlies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his 
tbleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself 
tto a standing position again.

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttWe got a major problem, Wayne.

<b>tWAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tHis vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than 
tcrisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily 
tforward.

<b>tPOINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK
</b>
tas Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A 
tPROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat.

<b>tWAYNE
</b>
ttakes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs 
tleading down to the next level. And when he arrives 
tthere...

<b>tWAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
</b>
<b>t...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A 
</b><b>tKNIFE.
</b>
<b>tWAYNE
</b>
tinstantly raises the rifle and FIRES...

<b>tWAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW
</b>
t...and the body goes down. He's hit him!

<b>tWAYNE
</b>
tstands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, 
tlooking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to 
tadjust the eyepiece diaptor.

<b>tWAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
</b>
tas the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, 
tfinally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER -- 
tthe same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier. 
tHe's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, 
tnot a knife.

<b>tWAYNE
</b>
tslowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his 
tthroat.

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttNo...

tHe raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will 
treveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.

<b>tWAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)
</b>
tHe gets half his wish: a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS 
tFRAME...but Jason is far from dead. Wayne catches a split-
tsecond glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then 
tthe camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES 
<b>tDARK AND BLURRY.
</b>
<b>tWAYNE
</b>
tscreams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips, 
tpicking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs. 
tWayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over 
tsomething, bringing with it a harsh strum from an 
<b>tELECTRIC GUITAR.
</b>
<b>tANGLE - WAYNE'S FEET
</b>
tSure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a 
tblood-streaked Gibson Flying V.

<b>tTIGHT ON WAYNE
</b>
t--sprawled out on the metal floor. He gropes around, his 
thands feeling something. It sends chills from his groin 
tup through his scalp.

<b>ttttWAYNE
</b>ttNo no no...

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE
</b>
tWayne's hands are touching J.J.'S BLOODY FACE, A LARGE 
tCRACK IN HER SKULL. He doesn't have time to scream or cry 
tbecause

<b>tJASON
</b>
thoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:

<b>tTHE SHIP CIRCUIT PANEL (EFX)
</b>
twhich shorts out with a fanfare of ELECTRICAL SPARKS 
<b>tAND FIRE, INSTANTLY FRYING WAYNE.
</b>
<b>tINT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME
</b>
tas the overhead lights briefly flicker, then resume 
tnormal operation. Sean stands opposite the navigational 
tchart, ping-ponging between it and the ship's 
tcomputers as Miss Van Deusen paces nervously.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttWhat was that??

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttt(very worried)
ttI don't know.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttt(beat)
ttWe could hit a reef, collide with

tThey are suddenly jolted with a DOOR SLAM as McCulloch 
tstorms onto the bridge.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttDid you find Rennie?

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttShe's locked safe in her room, no 
ttthanks to either of you.
ttt(like Sean isn't even in the 
tttroom)
ttHas he brought it back on course yet?

tSean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the 
twall of components.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttHe's doing the best he can, Charles.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttHe's the son of the Captain, for 
ttChrissakes. You'd think he'd be able 
ttto operate this thing!

tSean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind 
tand temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of 
tSean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He 
tchecks the Omega and LORAN.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttWell?

tSean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm. 
tHis father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the 
twheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of 
tbuttons on the console.

<b>tCLOSE UP - WALL OF BUTTONS
</b>
tWe PAN across them, stopping on one labeled "FIRE ALARM - 
tDO NOT BREAK EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." Camera 
tcontinues around to find we are in the POWER ROOM, NOT on

tat the alarm button, considering. He glances back over 
this shoulder.

<b>tRETURN TO SHOT
</b>
<b>ttttSEAN

tSean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated. Miss Van 
tDeuten immediately embraces him. But a fraction of time 
tlater:

<b>tTIGHT ON FIRE ALARM BUTTON
</b>
tJason's fist SMASHES the alarm button...

<b>tINT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

t...and a LOUD SIREN cries out across the entire vessel. 
tThe blood drains from Sean's face.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttThe fire alarm...

<b>tVARIOUS ANGLES ON BOARD SHIP - NIGHT
</b>
tas the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways 
tand corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep 
tpause for thought.

<b>tINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
tas the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody 
telse's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, 
tworking up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip 
ton them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE 
tIS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he 
thurries off.

<b>tINT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
</b>
tas McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY 
tFLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttCan you shut that damn thing off??

tSean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around 
tfor the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees 
tMcCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttWe already thought of that -- nobody 
ttcould possibly see it in this storm...

<b>ttttMCCULIACH

</b>ttI doubt very much that one even 
ttexists.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttUse some common sense! Setting off a 
ttfire alarm causes panic...the same 
ttkind of panic caused by suggesting 
ttJason Voorhees is on board.
ttt(resolved)
ttEnough is enough. 

tHe marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill 
tswitch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He 
tgrabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van 
tDeusen.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttWe have to get everybody together just 
ttin case the fire's for real.

tSean heads for the door, shoving it forward.

tdifferent deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along 
tthe side of the ship, skeet rifle raised.

<b>tJULIUS' POINT OF VIEW
</b>
twalking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and 
tprecipitation battering the small boats. With no warning, 
<b>tAN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE.
</b>
<b>tJULIUS
</b>
tshoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes 
tinstantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly 
tlowers the rifle.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tas MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out 
tof each other.

<b>ttttMILES
</b>ttI'll take the upper deck.

tJulius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the 
tsmoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent...

<b>tINT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)
</b>
tFilled with black smoke. The fire is spreading 
tdangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel 
tpump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads:

</b>
<b>tEXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT
</b>
t--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. 
tMiles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level.

<b>tPOINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER
</b>
tSomeone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every 
tstep.

<b>tEXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tas Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his 
tsurroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON 
tRIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tOnly darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles 
tmaterializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. 
tHe passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back 
tof his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS 
tINTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS 
<b>tAROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S 
</b><b>tHEAD...
</b>
t...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes 
tcontact, flinging it away.

<b>tEXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS
</b>
tHe's pacing along when a clattering noise from above 
tmakes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE 
tMAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, 
tjerking his head upward.

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttMiles??

tHis answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same 
ttime:

<b>tRUNNING WITH MILES
</b>
tHe's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery 
tdeck as the monster relentlessly pursues him.

<b>tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tHe's having no problem catching up to the defenseless 
tteenager.

<b>tEXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME
</b>
tas Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade.

<b>tEXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT
</b>
tas Miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it. He 
tglances downward and sees:

<b>tMILES' POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tJason is right at his heels.

<b>tMILES
</b>
tslips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward. 
tHe makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost 
tpoint when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM 
<b>tOFF THE MAST.
</b>
<b>tSTUNT FREEFALL
</b>
tMiles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting 
tand twisting like he's doing one of his better dives...

<b>tCLOSE UP - MILES' FACE  
</b>
t...Empty space for a half-second, then MILES' FACE JOLTS 
tINTO FRAME with a look of ultimate agony. Something has 
tabruptly stopped his fall. Something quite fatal.

<b>tEXT. DECK - ON JULIUS
</b>
tcoming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his 
tstomach wrenching as his eyes fall on:

<b>tMILES (EFX)
</b>
t...who is staring right back at him with dead pupils. 
<b>tMILES HAS BEEN HORRIBLY IMPALED OM A SHIP FLAGPOLE.
</b>
<b>tJULIUS
</b>
tdoesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because 
<b>tJASON'S HAND GRIPS HIS SHOULDER, SPINS HIM AROUND AND 
</b>tSLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the 
tboxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...

<b>tEXT. STORMY OCEAN (TANK)
</b>
t...and Julius SPLASHES INTO THE ROUGH SEA. He's quickly 
tswallowed by the torrential waters.

<b>tINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tas Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming 
tthat it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face; 
tshe begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER 
t...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing:

<b>ttttYOUNG JASON (O.S.)
</b>ttHhhhelp....me....

tRennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at:

<b>tYOUNG JASON (EFX)
</b>
t...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his 
thands reaching out to her. But then comes the 
tinexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND 
tJASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her 
troom, choking on murky water.

<b>ttttYOUNG JASON
</b>ttHhhhelp me....I'm drowning...

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tstands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a 
tmagnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a 
tdeep lake, and extends her arms to him.

<b>tYOUNG JASON
</b>
tgrabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tfeels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her 
teyes expanding because she's now looking at:

<b>tHERSELF!
</b>
tRennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger 
tin a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE.

<b>ttttYOUNG RENNIE
</b>ttHhhhelp....me....

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tscreams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, 
twatching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.

<b>tYOUNG RENNIE
</b>
tdisappears under the surface of the water...which seconds 
tlater CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.

<b>tNEW ANGLE
</b>
tas Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face, 
tutterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her 
tporthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH 
tTHE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles, 
tgasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.

<b>tCLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND
</b>
tgroping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering 
tacross her table like a spider.

<b>tTWO SHOT - RENNIE AND JASON
</b>
tHer head is pulled taut against the wall just below the 
tporthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the 
tcircular shattered window. She's slowly dying.

<b>tCLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND
</b>
tHer movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But 
tRennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: 
tthe ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen. She 
tseizes it, getting a firm grip.

<b>tCLOSE ON JASON
</b>
tas Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP 
tINSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason 
tinstantly releases her, reeling backwards.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tsinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far 
taway from the porthole as possible. She makes it across 
tthe room to her stateroom door just as:

<b>tTHE DOOR
</b>
tis SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in 
tterror but it's SEAN who is standing there.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttRennie...??

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttt(pointing)
ttThe window...

tSean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, 
tseeing nothing. He steps back to her.

ttto me...

tShe breaks down; he holds her.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttIt's gonna be okay...

<b>tINT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)
</b>
t...but Sean couldn't be more wrong. The flames are 
tlapping at the fuel pump and hoses, furiously burning 
tdown into the tank. A second later the whole thing

</b>
<b>tEXT. SHIP HULL - UNDERWATER (EFX/MODEL?)
</b>
tas a huge HOLE is blown through the thick steel hull:

</b>
tThe ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie 
tclings to him fearfully.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttWhat is it??

tOne second later, the lights begin to flicker.

</b>ttThe power room...

</b>
tas huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in 
tthe hull.

<b>tINT. SHIP KITCHEN - SAME TIME
</b>
tas the overhead lights flicker over McCulloch. There's 
tsome fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun, 
tmoving onward.

<b>tPONT OF VIEW FROM KITCHEN OVENS
</b>
tSomeone is crouched behind a massive convection oven, 
tspying on McCulloch.

<b>tMCCULLOCH
</b>
talmost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged 
tinto blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative. 
tHe passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them, 
tspotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the 
tshadows. The deranged old man is very sober now, 
tclutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense.

<b>tINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
tSean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room, 
ttrying to think, talking to himself.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttRule one, don't panic. Rule two, 
ttassess the damage and act 
ttaccordingly...

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttIs the ship going to sink??

tHe returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttI don't know.

tHer ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face. 
tSuddenly the dim blue lights flicker on.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttThe emergency lights just kicked in...

tSean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant 
tto convince himself as much as Rennie.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttWe'll be okay. I want you to wait by

tpanicking, sitting them down.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttEverybody wait right here until I come 
ttback with the others -- understand?

tThey nod, frightened to death. She dashes away, carrying 
tus into a view of the dining room windows. No one 
tnotices the SILHOUETTE OF JASON passing by on the outside 
tdesk.

<b>tINT. ENGINE ROOM - SAME TIME (EFX)

tSea water is pouring into the ship's motors. Clouds of

</b>
tas McCulloch rushes up to Rennie's already open door, 
tcautiously entering with flare gun raised.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttRennie??

<b>tMCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tThe room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered 
tacross her rug. He steps over to it, bringing his head up 
tto the gaping hole, peering outside. We wait for his 
tattack...but it doesn't come. McCulloch's eyes take us to 
tsomething across the room. The bathroom door is afar.

<b>tMCCULLOCH
</b>
tcautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the 
tknob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears 
tsomething, spinning around. Again, nothing is there. 
tMcCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few 
tseconds pass.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttCome on, answer!!

</b>
tTIGHT on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly. RISE 
tTO FIND JASON, ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck 
tbelow through rain-streaked windows.

</b>
tMiss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up 
ta trio of terrified seniors.

tJason methodically moves to the bank of switches, 
tstudying them.

tIn large, unmistakable letters over a red button are the 
twords "ABANDON SHIP ALARM." He flips back the plastic 
tsafety cover, exposing the button.

<b>tINT. BOWELS OF SHIP - SAME TIME  
</b>
tA horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow 
tcorridor. Sean and Rennie appear at the opposite end, 
tcoughing on the black smoke which clouds their 
tpassageway. Sean looks down, seeing that they are 
tstanding in a puddle of water.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttWater has gotten to the engines.
ttt(coughs)
ttWe have to get everybody off this 
ttship...

<b>tINSERT - ABANDON SHIP BUTTON
</b>
tas Jason presses it with firm deliberation, and:

<b>tINT. BOWELS OF SHIP - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tA WHOOPING SIREN blasts through the passageway. Sean and 
tRennie have no time to react because:

<b>tANGLE - CORRIDOR (EFX)

tA sealed compartment door EXPLODES OPEN WITH THE PRESSURE

</b>
<b>tREVERSE ANGLE (EFX)
</b>
t...and a WALL OF WATER ENGULFS.RENNIE AND SEAN, KNOCKING

tfor her to witness:

twhich bobs up in front of her. Rennie cries out, 
tscrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's

tSENIORS over to the LIFEBOAT STATIONS.

tThey follow her orders as the Abandon Ship alarm wretches

tSomeone is briskly moving towards the group and Miss Van 
tDeusen. Just as we are within a few feet of her...

tDeusen, shaking her violently.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttWhat did you do with Rennie??

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttNothing! I went to her cabin and...

tMcCulloch rushes off before she can finish. Miss Van

</b>ttEverybody hurry...please...

</b>
<b>tINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
tas Sean climbs up from below, soaked to the bone, pulling 
tup a half-conscious Rennie. Sean carries her around a 
tcorner, where he collides with McCulloch. McCulloch 
tpulls Rennie away from him.

ttNot another word, do you hear me??

<b>tEXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT

</b>
tOne of the students screams, the others clinging together 
tupon the sight of this infamous monster. But the boat is 
talready over the edge, past the point of return. And 
tlowering at a snail's pace.

<b>tMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>
tturns to see JASON APPROACHING THEM WITH AXE RAISED. She 
tbacks away but Jason ignores her, heading directly for 
tthe hoist. He arches back with his weapon and SLICES

</b>

tas Jason's axe CHOPS THE CABLE IN TWO, and:

tThe bow cable SNAPS, DUMPING THE HALF DOZEN TEENAGERS 
tINTO THE TURBULENT SALT WATER. They last about five 
tseconds before succumbing to a drowning death.

tsees it all, her intestines constricting in agonizing

t--knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as 
tshe flees. The creative writing teacher swerves around a 
tcolumn, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop 
tas it BANGS OPEN IN FRONT OF HER. McCulloch steps 
toutside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her. 
tRennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon 
tthe sight of Miss Van Deusen.

tas Rennie rushes into Miss Van Deusen's arms. The teacher 
tholds her, beginning to cry herself.

tFinally the message comes forth:

tHis face grows taut with anger.

tA PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind 
tthem, the words unintelligible. They turn around to 
twitness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING 
<b>tTHE KITCHEN KNIFE. 
</b>
<b>tMCCULLOCH
</b>
traises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT...

<b>tANGLE - DECK HAND (EFX)
</b>
t...and the charge EXPLODES INTO HIS CHEST. He stands 
tthere with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle 
tin effigy. A second later the poor old man falls forward, 
tand:

<b>tCLOSE ON HIS BACK (EFX)
</b>
tThey all see that JASON'S AXE HAS BEEN BURIED IN HIS

tas McCulloch, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie and Sean scramble 
tto the closest lifeboat.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttEverybody in -- I'll get the hoists

tMcCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the 
tlifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing 
tclassy-eyed at the small boat.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttCome on, sweetheart -- get in...

tBut she doesn't budge. McCulloch levels wild eyes on her,

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttLeave her alone, Charles!

tMiss Van Deusen quickly moves to a hysterical Rennie and 
tholds her, eyeing McCulloch vehemently.

<b>tEXT. DECK - TIGHT ON DEAD DECK HAND - SAME TIME

tgrabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch.

</b>ttStart rowing!!

tMcCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto

tJason is none.

tSean breathes with some relief, resuming his rowing with 
tMcCulloch. They get about three strokes apiece before:

<b>tA DARK FIGURE (TANK)
</b>
tlunges from under the ocean surface, grabbing onto 
tSean. Everybody SCREAMS...but it's JULIUS, gasping for 
toxygen, spitting up seawater. Sean pulls him over the

ttDo you know where we are, Sean?

tSean pauses, utterly exhausted. He thinks for a moment, 
tremembering his father's gift. Sean reaches into his coat 
tpocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator. He 
tstares at it long and hard. Julius looks over at him, 
tseeing that Sean is on the verge of tears. He grips his

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttGod damn, we're in New York! You did 
ttit, my man!!

tJulius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie 
tas Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks.

<b>tWIDE SHOT - NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.)
</b>
tas the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of 
tManhattan, twinkling in the near distance. We can hear 
tthe faint sound of Julius singing "New York, New York," 
trelieved to be alive. They're going to make it.

<b>tEXT. EMPTY OCEAN - ANOTHER ANGLE (TANK)
</b>
tas the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter. The water 
tbegins to ripple...then the top half of a HOCKEY MASK 
<b>tBREAKS THE SURFACE FOR A BREATH OF AIR, SINKING AGAIN. 
</b>tAnd swimming onward.

<b>tEXT. CANNERY HARBOR - NIGHT
</b>
tas Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge 
tbeneath deserted dock warehouses. They are not in the 
tsafest part of town by a longshot.

<b>tCLOSER ANGLE
</b>
tas they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief 
tas she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back 
tat it and sees:

<b>tYOUNG RENNIE
</b>
tflailing her arms in the water right next to the 
tlifeboat, drowning.

<b>ttttYOUNG RENNIE
</b>ttHhhhelp...me....

tSuddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW, 
<b>tGRABBING HER, DRAGGING HER UNDER.
</b>
<b>tEXT. BARGE - ON RENNIE
</b>
tShe gazes in utter shock, screaming:

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttNo!!!

tThey all follow her eyeline...but the water is calm, 
tnothing there.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttt(holding her)
ttIt's okay...you're safe now...

tMcCulloch grits his teeth.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttCome on -- everybody up the ladder.

tHe's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, 
tthen hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing 
tthe ladder.

<b>tCLOSE ON LADDER - NIGHT
</b>
tas the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of 
tthe dock. Camera PANS back down the rungs, finding the 
tlifeboat and barge again. Suddenly JASON SPRINGS FROM THE 
tWATER, CLIMBING ONTO THE BARGE. He gazes up at his new 
tsurroundings, quite different from all the years he's 
tspent at Crystal Lake. But an item at the far end of the 
tdock causes him the longest pause...

<b>tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tA tattered billboard over one of the warehouses 
tadvertises the NEW YORK RANGERS HOCKEY TEAM, featuring a 
tfull shot of the HOCKEY-MASKED GOALIE.

<b>tJASON
</b>
tlooks at it long and hard. He tears off his life 
tpreserver wits renewed ambition.

<b>tWIDE SHOT - BARGE AND DOCK WAREHOUSES - NIGHT

tas Jason heads up the ladder. He's about to take 
tManhattan.

<b>tEXT. CANNERY WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

tas our survivors head into an isolated, foreboding group 
tof dock warehouses and alleys.

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN
</b>ttThere must be a phone around here 
ttsomewhere.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttA wonderful choice of places to dock a

tSean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper.

</b>
tWe're spying on them from behind a stack of crates as 
tthey come in our direction. Waiting for the right moment.

<b>tRETURN TO SHOT
</b>
tas they move towards the stack of crates. Without 
twarning, a PAIR OF GANG BANGERS JUMP OUT, BOTH HOLDING 
tGUNS. Nervous young druggies.

<b>ttttGANG RANGER #1
</b>ttHands up!!

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #2  
</b>ttDo it!!

tAll hands go up. Gang Banger #2 grabs McCulloch's watch 
tand wallet, skimming through a wad of bills and credit 
tcards while #1 keeps them covered.

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #2
</b>ttGot some good shit here, holmes.

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #1
</b>ttt(eyeing Rennie)
ttYou got that right...

tHe steps over to Rennie, brushing her hair back with the 
tbarrel of his revolver, spotting the Statue of Liberty 
tpendant Sean gave her.

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #L
</b>ttNow ain't that sweet.

tHe tears it off her neck, pocketing it. Sean angrily 
tmoves toward him and Gang Banger #l shoves the barrel 
tagainst Rennie's temple.

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #1
</b>ttGo ahead, superman. Be a hero.

tSean has no choice but to freeze. Julius flexes his 
tfists, but he too has Gang Banger #2's gun leveled on 
thim. McCulloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt. 
tIt doesn't go unnoticed.

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #L
</b>ttYou got a problem, Dad?

tMcCulloch offers some rare silence, shaking a "no" to the 
tgun-toting kid. Rennie's dog-begins to growl, backing 
taway, ready to defend her. Gang Banger #1 points his 
tbarrel at Toby with zero conscience, cocking back the 
thammer.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttNo!

tShe pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet 
<b>tFIRES...
</b>
<b>tANGLE - TOBY
</b>
tas the bullet tears up asphalt next to the dog's paws. 
tToby sprints off into the darkness.

<b>tRETURN TO SHOT
</b>
tGang Banger #1 grabs Rennie by the hair, brutally jerking 
ther head back.

</b>ttPlease, don't hurt her...

</b>ttHurt this princess?

ttWould I do that?

tThey cough out laughs. Gang Banger #1 looks into Rennie's

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #1
</b>ttYou look like a party girl, princess. 
ttHow'd you like to go on a date with me 
ttand my friend? If you're free, that

</b>ttYou follow and we'll blow her fuckin'

tThe others watch helplessly as Rennie is abducted.

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttWe can't let those gang-bangers get

tJulius starts to move after them. McCulloch grabs him.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttYou heard him! We have to call the

tJulius jerks away from McCulloch's grasp. But he knows 
tMcCullochtis right.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH

</b>ttI don't think that's such a safe idea

</b>ttMy niece's life hangs in the balance 
ttright now!! Every second counts.

tNo more rebuttal. They hurry off.

<b>tEXT. GANG BANGER'S LAIR - NIGHT
</b>
tIt's a narrow passageway between warehouses...decrepit 
tbrownstones with shattered chicken-wire windows, moss 
tgrowing on the bricks. The Gang Bangers appear with 
tRennie, dragging her down some concrete steps.

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #L
</b>ttWelcome to the casbah, princess.

tPAN AROUND with them as they walk through a thick blanket 
tof STEAM which pours out of a factory vent. We MOVE 
tthrough the mist with them, revealing a tattered, rain-
tsoaked couch and chair, upholstery shredded. A spool once 
tused for telephone wire functions as their coffee table. 
tThey splash through puddles, throwing her down on the 
tcouch.

</b>
t--looking back at the steam vent. JASON APPEARS IN THE 
<b>tBILLOWING MIST.
</b>
<b>tCLOSE UP - SYRINGE
</b>
tas a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle. WIDEN 
tto find Gang Banger #2 holding it with transfixed eyes, 
this compadre holding a squirming Rennie down on the 
tcouch, tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttPlease don't...

</b>ttLoosen up, baby. It'll feel way
ttbetter if you're stoned.

tAmongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded

tGang Banger #1 wrestles off his torn leather jacket, 
tpushing Rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his 
tfriend watches excitedly.

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #1
</b>ttSlang us some more 'caine, JoJo. We're 
ttin for a long night.

tGang Banger #2 runs out the back way. #1 tears open 
tRennie's blouse, his filthy mouth moving to her neck. 
tRennie spits in his face. He hesitates not in SLAPPING 
<b>tHER HARD.
</b>
<b>ttttGANG BANGER #1
</b>ttIt's your parade, princess. Can be 
ttsmooth or can be rough. Your choice.

tShe closes .her eyes, trying to blot out what's about to 
thappen.

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #1
</b>ttI think I'm in love.

tPUSH IN on his face as his neck arches down, bringing his 
tlips toward her chest. Just before contact he GRUNTS 
<b>tTHICKLY, HIS EYES BUGGING OUT.
</b>
<b>tWIDER ANGLE
</b>
tJason is standing right behind him, shoving something 
tinto his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again, 
tbringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid. 
tJason goes for number three and: 

<b>tCLOSE UP - GANG BANGER #1'S CHEST (EFX)
</b>
tJason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the 
tneedle sticking out his front side.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
topens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as 
tblood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of 
ther, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At 
tthe same time:

<b>tGANG BANGER #2
</b>
tcomes around the corner.

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #2
</b>ttForgot my money, holmes...

tHa stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Jason.

<b>ttttGANG BANGER #2
</b>ttWho the fuck are you?

tJason paces toward him. The kid glances at his dead 
tfriend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his 
<b>t.38.
</b>
<b>ttttGANG BANGER #2
</b>ttYou're dead, fuckhead.

<b>tBANG!
</b>
t...but Jason keeps on coming. Five shots later and 
tJason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball 
tand SHOVING HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE MOSSY BRICK WALL. The 
tkid falls in a bloody heap.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tshoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his 
tattention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT 
tAT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily 
tdisorienting him. Rennie sprints away.

<b>tEXT. ALLEY #1 - NIGHT (LONG LENS)
</b>
tas Julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley, 
tspotting a phone booth. He hurries for it.

<b>tPREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tLike a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the 
tbooth.

<b>tJULIUS
</b>
tslams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, 
tpunching the "operator" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as 
the waits for an answer. Several more rings.

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttC'mon...

tFinally a click and muffled words from the operator.

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttGet me the police -- this is an 
ttemergency...

<b>tttt
</b>
tSMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW, 
tGRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly 
tarm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey 
tmask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all 
this strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running 
tout the door. The phone is left dangling.

<b>tRUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD)
</b>
twith no apparent direction. Literally running for his 
tlife.

<b>tTRACKING WITH JASON
</b>
tHe's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical.

<b>tJULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (HAND HELD)
</b>
theading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting 
this course straight for it.

<b>tANGLE - FIRE ESCAPE
</b>
tas Julius LEAPS ONTO IT, dragging himself up, climbing as 
tfast as is humanly possible.

<b>tANGLE - JASON
</b>
t...but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the 
twrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up.

<b>tEXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tas Julius' head appears, clawing his way onto the tar-
tpapered surface, running to the opposite side. A second 
tlater, JASON HOPS UP RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE
</b>
tas Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way 
tup is the only way down...with the exception of a head-
tsplitting freefall. No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns 
tback to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for 
tthe fight of his life. He whispers to himself:

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttUse the combos and keep the feet 
ttlight...

tTHE FIGHT BEGINS, man against monster, each sizing the 
tother up. 
tJason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him 
tand countering with left-right-left combination. They 
thave absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round 
tof kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself 
tbeing forced back against the rings, which in this case 
tis the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and 
tsees:

<b>tJULIUS' POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tIt's a long, rough way down. It's do or die time.

<b>tRETURN TO SCENE
</b>
tas Julius SLAMS PUNCH AFTER PUNCH INTO JASON, forcing him 
tback to the center of the rooftop, spending every last 
tounce of his energy in doing so. He throws one more 
tfeeble punch, knowing it's his last.

<b>ttttJULIUS
</b>ttTake your best shot, motherfucker...

tJason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a 
tpunch none of us expected...

<b>tJULIUS' HEAD (EFX)
</b>
tgets literally knocked off his shoulders, cascading off 
tthe edge of the rooftop, and:

<b>tANGLE - SLANTED LOWER ROOF
</b>
t--the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below, 
trolling down towards street level and falling into a 
tgarbage-filled dumpster.

<b>tEXT. ALLEY #2 - NIGHT  
</b>
tas Rennie dizzily runs down the alley, the effects of the 
tdrugs kicking in.

<b>tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
</b>
tBlurry, disoriented, erratic. Suddenly A FIGURE JUMPS OUT 
<b>tFROM A CORRIDOR IN FRONT OF HER.
</b>
<b>tRETURN TO SHOT
</b>
tIt's SEAN. He rushes to her, sensing her disorientation.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttRennie...what'd they do to you??

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttDrugs...
ttt(serious pause)
ttThen Jason came. He's here, Sean.

tOh Jesus. He never expected this.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttWe have to find the others.

tTogether they run off.

<b>tEXT. ALLEY #3 - NIGHT (OVERHEAD ANGLE)
</b>
tas Miss Van Deusen briskly walks below us, far from 
trelaxed in this threatening environment.

<b>tTRACKING SHOT
</b>
tShe moves forward, the only sound being her shoes against 
twet asphalt. Four more steps, then a DARK, OUT OF FOCUS 
<b>tFIGURE STEPS OUT BEHIND HER WITH A GUN.
</b>
<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttFreeze.

tRACK FOCUS to find a uniformed IRISH COP standing there, 
tservice revolver raised. McCulloch steps out from the 
talcove as well, recognizing Miss Van Deusen.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttIt's okay -- she's with me.

tShe turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved.

<b>ttttIRISH COP
</b>ttMy apologies, Miss. My unit's right 
ttover here.

tThey head through an ABANDONED PARKING LOT towards a 
tconcrete wall with stairs; about six feet above the wall 
tis an upper street, where his patrol car is parked. They 
tget halfway through the lot when they hear:

<b>ttttSEAN (O.S.)
</b>ttHey!

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE
</b>
tas Sean and Rennie run to join them from the alley. 
tMcCulloch rushes to his niece.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttRennie, thank God...

tBut Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead. It's a bitter 
tpill for McCulloch.

</b>ttJason's here in New York.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttDon't be ridiculous!

<b>ttttMISS VAN DEUSEN

ttYes.

<b>ttttIRISH COP
</b>ttWho is...Jason?

tThe others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen 
tturns to the confused policeman.

</b>ttI'm afraid you'll have some trouble 
ttbelieving us.

<b>ttttIRISH COP
</b>ttSo try me.

ttowards it.

</b>ttYou're right -- I find it a tall tale 
ttindeed. 
ttBut you seem like honest folks so I'm

tThe car dome light blinks on, and...

tOur four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated,

tgrabbing the radio mike. But he has no time for a message 
tbecause JASON REACHES UP FROM THE PARKING LOT PIT BELOW, 
tGRABBING THE COP'S ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN. The radio is 
tstill in his grasp.

<b>tINSERT - DISPATCH RADIO (SECOND UNIT)

tas the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping. The 
tIrish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a 
tsick THUD.

</b>
tThe foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police 
tcars have no door handles in the back.

<b>ttttSEAN

tCocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts 
thyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just 
tas:

</b>
<b>tINT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

tThere is no time for escape. Rennie finds the ignition 
tand fires it up, jamming it into drive and STOMPING ON

tthe floorboards.

<b>tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)

</b>
tJason is mowed down.

tas the automobile grinds back over him a second time.

tJason lies dead on the asphalt. For about two seconds. He

tas they screech to a halt one final time, rapidly 
trotating in the opposite direction and speeding out of

tRennie is almost maniacal now, her knuckles white around 
tthe vinyl wheel, her foot practically mashed through the

tShe doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her

tThere's a FIGURE standing in the distance. But it looks 
ttoo small to be Jason. We RUSH TOWARDS IT, CHANGING INTO

tas the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who 
tdrags out Rennie. McCulloch follows close behind, helping

tThe squad car interior is ENGULFED IN A BALL OF FLAMES.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
topens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body 
tcharring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She 
tnumbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something 
tmakes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt...

<b>tEXT. ASPHALT - RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX)
</b>
tA pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across 
tits glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN, 
tnot unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The 
trowboat glides across the surface of the burning 
tgasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt 
<b>tSLOWLY FADE OUT AND GIVE WAY TO A SERENE LAKE.
</b>
<b>tRENNIE'S FLASHBACK - CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY

tShimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it. 
tThe rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG 
tRENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an 
tinnocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the 
twater. She stands, letting the sun soak into her.

<b>ttttYOUNG RENNIE
</b>ttWhat a beautiful day.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttPerfect for a swim, isn't it?

ttswim.

<b>ttttYOUNG RENNIE
</b>ttYou're telling a lie.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttAm I? Let's find out.

t...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH 
<b>tPUSHES HER OVERBOARD.
</b>
<b>tSPLASH!
</b>
tas Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface. 
tShe immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly 
tleans over the edge.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttBetter swim before Jason drags you 
ttdown, Rennie. Come on, you can do 
ttit...

t...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep 
tfrom sinking under the surface.

<b>tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tHer uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her 
teyes.

<b>ttttYOUNG RENNIE
</b>ttI...I can't...

</b>ttYou can and you will! Swim, Rennie!

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tis too panicked to obey.

<b>ttttYOUNG RENNIE
</b>ttHhhhelp...me....

tShe coughs on some water then disappears...

<b>tUNDERWATER (TANK)
</b>
tThe world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water 
ttaking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror...

<b>tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK)
</b>
tYoung Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her 
tdown. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we:

<b>tttttttt  DISSOLVE BACK TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT
</b>
tas the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone. 
tADJUST to find RENNIE'S FACE, the flames of the car 
twreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. She looks up at 
tMiss Van Deusen's body one last time before:

<b>tANGLE - SQUAD CAR (EFX)
</b>
tThe auto's fuel tank EXPLODES, SHRAPNEL FLYING 
<b>tEVERYWHERE.
</b>
<b>tEXT. ALLEY #4 - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tShe looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. Eyes that 
ttell him she's remembered everything.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttYou pushed me...

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttt(defensively)
ttI was only trying to teach you. But I 
ttpulled you out, Rennie. I saved your

tRennie just stares, incredulous.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttYou son of a bitch...

tShe lets it build until she's ready to explode...then:

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttHe was down there!!!

tAnd Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean 
tgrabs him, shoving him down.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttYou keep away from her!

tSean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK 
tTO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man. 
tHe wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE 
tSHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white.

<b>ttttMCCULLOCH
</b>ttYou...are...NOT POSSIBLE.

tBut possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS 
<b>tEXTEND DOWN, RIPPING HIM OUT OF FRAME.
</b>
<b>tTRACKING WITH JASON
</b>
tas the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over 
this head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL 
tDRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips 
tMcCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface 
tof the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the 
tdrum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason 
treleases him, moving on.

<b>tEXT. ALLEY #5 - NIGHT
</b>
tas Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie, 
tcrouched against a crumbled brick wall. No tears...only 
thate. Sean sits down next to her. After several 
tmoments...

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttI was at school when they told me. 
tt'Rennie, we have some very bad news... 
ttyour parents have been killed in an

tSean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttIt seems like everybody I care about 
ttends up...

tShe can't finish. PUSH IN as Sean kisses her on the 
tforehead, then makes her look into his eyes.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttNot this time.

tHe caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss. 
tFinally she holds him back, letting it out. At the same 
ttime:

<b>tSTALKING POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tSomebody is creeping at a low angle towards them.

<b>tSEAN AND RENNIE
</b>
tare lost in their shared quiet moment...until the 
tGROWLING SOUND becomes audible. They look up, seeing:

<b>tTOBY
</b>
tcautiously approaching them. Rennie stands, absolutely 
trelieved.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttToby...

tShe starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS 
<b>tVICIOUSLY, CROUCHING BACK IN FEAR.
</b>
<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttWhat's wrong, boy?

tAnother protective growl, then:

<b>tCRASH!
</b>
tas Jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage 
tcans behind them.

<b>tSEAN, RENNIE AND TOBY
</b>
tabruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit.t

<b>tEXT. ALLEY/SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

tJason swiftly catching up. FAST TRACK WITH THEM over to a 
tdeserted, rain-slicked SUBWAY ENTRANCE.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS (EFX)
</b>
tas they bang through the glass doors, sailing past us. 
tThree beats later, JASON APPEARS, not bothering to open 
tthe door, STAMPEDING RIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY STATION - ESCALATORS (N.Y.)
</b>
tSean, Rennie and Toby sail down the escalators past a few 
tscattered COMMUTERS. Again, Jason appears, looming tall 
tat the top. He starts down the "up" escalator.

<b>tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW (ICY.)
</b>
tas an ELDERLY COUPLE rises toward us. Their reactions 
tgrow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering 
tterror as we plow right through them.

<b>tANGLE - SUBWAY TURNSTILES (ICY.)
</b>
tSean and Rennie hop over a metal turnstile, Toby crawling 
tunder it. A TICKET TAKER leans out his window, shouting 
tat them.

<b>ttttTICKET TAKER
</b>ttHey!

tThe teenagers are soon forgotten as JASON SMASHES THROUGH 
<b>tTHE TURNSTILE LIKE THE TERMINATOR, TEARING THE ALUMINUM 
</b>tWHEEL RIGHT OFF ITS BASE. The Ticket Taker reacts 
tspeechlessly, deciding not to press his luck.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)
</b>
tas Sean and Rennie slide up to the edge of the track pit, 
tSEEING THE LIGHTS OF AN APPROACHING TRAIN which is taking 
ttoo long to get there.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttCome on...

t...but Jason arrives before the train. Toby barks and 
tsnarls, trying to protect them. Jason is unfazed. He 
ttreads toward them and:

<b>tDOG TOBY
</b>
tleaps onto Jason, sinking his teeth into the monster's 
tthroat. Jason wrestles the animal into submission just 
tas:

<b>tTHE SUBWAY TRAIN
</b>
tstreaks into the station. A fraction of time later:

<b>tJASON
</b>
theaves the dog in front of the train.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tshrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just 
tas the train roars by.

<b>tANGLE - ONLOOKERS
</b>
tThey're New Yorkers, but not callous enough to stomach 
tthis, quickly scattering. Even a group of severe 
tSKINHEADS decide they can wait for the next train, 
tquickly heading up the escalators after seeing Jason in 
taction.

<b>tSEAN
</b>
tmakes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the 
tplatform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention 
tto them. They reach the end of the platform, having no 
tchoice but to board the front car.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY TRAIN (N.Y.)
</b>
tas the doors whoosh shut...but Jason PRIES THEM OPEN. The 
tTRAIN ENGINEER glances back from his booth, seeing Jason 
tmaking the improper entry.

<b>ttttTRAIN ENGINEER
</b>ttHey pal, you can't do that...

tA second later he's gotten a good look at Jason. It's too 
tlate for a retraction as JASON SAVAGELY JAMS HIS HEAD 
<b>tINTO THE TRAIN CONSOLE.
</b>
<b>tINSERT - TRAIN CONSOLE
</b>
tas the Engineer's arm KNOCKS THE THROTTLE FORWARD...

<b>tEXT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)
</b>
t...and the train begins to move, racing into the black 
ttunnel.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT (N.Y.)
</b>
tas Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the 
tend of a car, jamming the separating doors open and 
tentering the next car. Jason follows right behind.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)
</b>
tas the train thunders through the station without 
tstopping, baffling several waiting COMMUTERS.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (N.Y.)
</b>
t--seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another 
tconnecting door. We storm our way through it into the 
tnext car right after them. A handful of TRAVELERS cower 
taway from us.

</b>
tas the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of 
tslowing down.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - FINAL CAR (N.Y.)
</b>
tas Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating 
tdoors, rushing through... finding they're in the last 
tcar. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite 
tend. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart 
taround. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR 
<b>tIT.
</b>
<b>tEXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)
</b>
t...and the train SCREECHES TO A HALT.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.)
</b>
tThe sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the 
trear door open, jumping out with Rennie.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.)
</b>
tas Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks 
ttoward the light of the next station, running out of 
tstrength.

<b>tINT. TIMES SQUARE STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.)
</b>
tas they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the 
tpit. Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself 
twhen:

<b>tJASON
</b>
tfires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. 
tRennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages 
tto latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. 
tJason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as 
tRennie watches helplessly.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b><b>ttNO!!!
</b>
<b>tRENNIE
</b>
truns straight towards the track pit like a football 
tpunter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON 
<b>tSQUARELY IN THE FACE.
</b>
<b>tJASON (EFX)
</b>
ttrips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL, 
tRECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and 
tconvulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be 
tterminated!!!

<b>tANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE
</b>
tas they get to their feet, holding each other tight, 
tlooking down on the now-dead undead creature.

<b>tEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.) (CRANE SHOT)
</b>
tas our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city 
twonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the 
tawesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL 
tCLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his 
tarm around her.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttIt's over, Rennie. It's finally over.

tCamera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. 
tGuess who has just made an encore...with more energy 
tthan ever!!!

<b>tSEAN AND RENNIE
</b>
tlook all around them, having never been to a city as big 
tas this. They finally turn far enough around to spot 
tJASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer 
tthan the last.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttGod...please no...

tBut Jason keeps on coming.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttSomebody help us!! He's going to kill 
ttus!!!

tBut the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, 
tbustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to 
tflee again.

<b>tJASON
</b>
tshoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; 
tthey've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. 
tHe moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some 
trap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates 
ttheir stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull 
tout switchblades and chains.

<b>ttttSTREET URCHIN
</b>ttYou're dead meat, slime bag.

tJason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He 
thas blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred 
tfrom the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask, 
tfacing them squarely.

<b>tTIGHT ON STREET URCHINS
</b>
tas Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces 
tturn to putty, scared completely shitless.

<b>ttttSTREET URCHIN
</b>ttHey man, it's cool, it's cool...

tThey turn tail and race like the wind. Jason steps 
tforward so that we're looking at the back of his head, 
tnever seeing his naked face. He slips his hockey mask on 
tagain, turns into a CLOSE UP, then exits.

<b>tINT. TIMES SQUARE DINER - NIGHT
</b>
tfilled with noise, smoke and derelicts. A tough, 
tredheaded WAITRESS with a thick Brooklyn accent stands 
tbehind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. The 
tfront door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and 
tRennie, rushing up to the waitress.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttt(out of breath)
ttYou have to call the police...

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttPlease, hurry...

tA telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>ttThere's a pay phone in back.

tThey start to run.

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>tt...but it's broken.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttYou don't understand -- there's a

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>ttt(blase)
ttWelcome to New York.

tThere's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES 
<b>tTHROUGH THE DINER DOOR, MOWING A PATH STRAIGHT TOWARDS 
</b>tTHEM. Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress 
teyes Jason with complete disbelief.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tas the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS 
<b>tHIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX.
</b>
<b>tTHE WAITRESS
</b>
tpicks up the telephone, really pissed off.

<b>tA BIKER
</b>
tclimbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE 
tKNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS 
tJASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it 
tout, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing 
taway.

<b>tTHE WAITRESS
</b>
tstops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.

<b>tJASON
</b>
tlifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO 
<b>tTHE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER.
</b>
<b>tTHE WAITRESS
</b>
tfeels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her 
tmouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as 
tshe can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out 
tthe back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons 
tshrink from him.

<b>tINT. REAR OF DINER - SAME TIME
</b>
tas Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains, 
tfinally getting the back door open and springing into:

<b>tEXT. DEAD END ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
tThey run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a 
tdead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other 
tway when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision 
tscatters everywhere in search of a retreat...

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttLook!

tShe's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They 
thaven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the 
tcover back as Jason comes forth.

<b>tINT. SEWER - ENTRANCE CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tas they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting 
tof tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of 
tstagnant water. Their alternatives are nil; Sean and 
tRennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing 
tdeeper into the labyrinth.

<b>tANGLE UP STAIRS
</b>
tas the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is 
teclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL #1 - NIGHT
</b>
tAn oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness. 
tDim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery 
trust formations. Rennie and Sean appear at the far end, 
twading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us.

<b>tTRACKING SHOT
</b>
tas they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, 
tstrangers in a very strange land.

<b>tANGLE - THEIR FEET
</b>
tsloshing through the slime. All is silent until Sean's 
tfoot TRIPS OVER A BARREL labeled HUGHES CHEMICAL PLANT. 
tA vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of 
tthe container, sizzling on the around.

<b>tSEAN AND RENNIE
</b>
tcarefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it 
tanother ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE, 
tGRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through 
tthe tunnel.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE
</b>
t...but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers 
tthe wrench, as frightened as they are.

<b>ttttSANITATION ENGINEER
</b>ttWhat the hell are you kids doing down 
tthere?

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttCan you help us get out??

<b>ttttSANITATION ENGINEER
</b>ttI sure can and we don't have a minute 
ttto waste.

tHe begins quickly packing up his tools.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttSANITATION ENGINEER
</b>ttToxic waste, son. This sewer floods 
ttout with the stuff on the 13th of 
ttevery month, right at midnight.
ttt(checks watch)
ttAnd that's less than ten minutes from 
ttnow.

tRennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, 
tswallowing hard.

<b>ttttSANITATION ENGINEER
</b>ttFollow me.

tHe clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly 
tleads them down:

<b>tINT. TUNNEL #2
</b>
t...no less threatening than the one they just left. When 
tthey pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS 
<b>tHIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND 
</b><b>tSEAN.
</b>
<b>tTHE FLASHLIGHT
</b>
trolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically 
tacross the polluted walls.

<b>tTHE SANITATION ENGINEER
</b>
tbegins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the 
tmonster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL 
<b>t#3.
</b>
<b>tRENNIE
</b>
ttries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the 
topposite wall, barely conscious.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttRun, Rennie...

tShe's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel 
t#3, seeing:

<b>tA GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL
</b>
tJason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it 
tover and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tbacks away but does not run. The time has come to face 
ther fears.

<b>tANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL
</b>
tas Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him 
toff. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated 
ttool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for 
tSean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench 
tover Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is 
tSPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning 
tdirectly into it.

<b>tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tRennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's 
tflashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in 
tthe reflective wet surroundings.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttYou never got me in the lake, Jason. 
ttAnd you're not going to get me now 
tteither.

tHer voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the 
tirritating light never leaving us.

<b>tJASON
</b>
thas been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.

<b>tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tas the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down 
tthe intersecting tunnel (#1).

<b>tTIGHT ON JASON'S FEET
</b>
tstomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's 
twanted to kill Rennie most of all.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL #L
</b>
tas Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean 
ttripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to 
tcrush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but 
tstill resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL #2 - TRACKING WITH JASON
</b>
tHe's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling 
tafter his fix.

<b>tINSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM
</b>
tas the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately 
tcausing it to cave in.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
t--Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into 
tTunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie 
tflinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second 
tlater a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US...

<b>tTIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION)
</b>
tand his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE, 
tSEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if 
ther were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank 
tbuckshot.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tdrops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.

<b>tCLOSE UP - JASON (EFX)
</b>
tas the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the 
tplastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT 
<b>tCLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS 
</b>tHIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the 
tchemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his 
teyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs 
tfrying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just 
tbroke, running down his face.

<b>tCLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT
</b>
tas the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE 
tTO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning 
tsight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and 
<b>tRUNS.
</b>
<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tas Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH 
tHER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward 
tSean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come 
taround 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way 
tready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL #2
</b>
tas Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed. She grabs him, 
tshaking hard.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttGet up, Sean!!!

tHis eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable 
tterror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING 
tSOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the 
tdirection of her planned retreat:

<b>tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
tAn ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the 
tunthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at 
tleaps and bounds.

<b>tTIGHT ON RENNIE
</b>
tas her trembling chin rises, looking at:

<b>tANGLE - TUNNEL #3 CEILING (EFX)
</b>
tThe dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from 
tthe approaching flood.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
trotates her head and sees:

<b>tJASON
</b>
tvision or no vision, he is lurching towards her 
trelentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell 
tand high water.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tdrags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed 
twoman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to 
tthe intersecting alcove wall.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttt(screaming)
ttClimb!!!

tShe shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning 
teverything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare 
tback down the tunnel...

<b>tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
</b>
tThe overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake 
thas just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her

tFROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms 
tlike the claws of a roto-tiller.

<b>tANGLE - LADDER
</b>
tas Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing:

<b>tJASON
</b>
twithin ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder 
tlike he's working on some kind of radar.

<b>tRENNIE
</b>
tslips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and 
trushing higher. She takes her final glance into the 
ttunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as 
tshe sees:

<b>tINT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)
</b>
tA million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into 
tthe far intersection, FILLING THE TUNNEL, FLOODING 
<b>tSTRAIGHT FOR CAMERA.
</b>
<b>tJASON
</b>
thas just started to climb the ladder when the wind and 
tsmell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His 
tdecomposed head swivels to face:

</b>
tTons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. Arriving in 
tseconds.

<b>tJASON'S FINAL CLOSE UP (EFX/FIBER OPTIC LENS)

<b>ttttJASON
</b>ttMmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN,

</b>
tCamera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT 
tas lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We 
tsink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into 
tour eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS 
tSTOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS 
<b>tDROWNING IN IT.
</b>
<b>ttttYOUNG JASON
</b>ttHhhhelp me....

tA split second later:

<b>tEXT. TUNNEL #3 (EFX) (SLOW MOTION)
</b>
tThe wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL #3 - ON RENNIE AND SEAN (EFX)
</b>
tThe powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches 
tbelow Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking 
ttheir rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with 
ttheir eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)
</b>
tWe are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over 
tand under us.

<b>tEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (EFX)
</b>
tThe digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES 
<b>tMIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER 
</b><b>tMANHATTAN.
</b>
<b>tANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX)
</b>
tas the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her 
teyes, glancing straight down and seeing.

<b>tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)
</b>
tThe ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a 
tPAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops 
tfurther, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR 
tOLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy, 
tprobably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he 
tdrowned in Crystal Lake.

tJason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.

<b>tEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.)
</b>
tRennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding 
teach other up...relief etched in their matured faces.

<b>ttttSEAN
</b>ttI hear there's a statue here that's 22 
ttstories tall.

tRennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek. 
tThey amble on.

<b>tSTALKING POINT OF VIEW
</b>
t...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them 
tthrough a crowd of pedestrians. About the height of a 
tsmall child.

<b>tRENNIE AND SEAN
</b>
twalk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their 
tpursuer. But something, some innate perception causes 
tRennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid 
tfear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...

<b>tTOBY!
</b>
tLimping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The 
twhimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down, 
thugging her animal like she'll never let go.

<b>ttttRENNIE
</b>ttOh Toby...

<b>tHIGH ANGLE CRANE SHOT (N.Y.)
</b>
tas Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing 
tagain with Rennie. The three survivors enter the collage 
tof pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers. 

tIt is finally over.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT.
</b>
<b>tttttTHE END
