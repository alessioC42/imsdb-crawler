<b>                            WONDER BOYS
</b>
<b>                BASED ON THE NOVEL BY MICHAEL CHABON
</b>
                       Screenplay/Steve Kloves

tJanuary 21, 1999 (Pink Revision) 
tJanuary 15, 1999 (Blue Revision) 
tDecember 18,1998


tAll IS A BLUR. . .

t...then WORDS appear, twisting and vaguely transparent, 
treflected on the window GRADY TRIPP stands before as he 
treads from a sheaf of NEATLY-TYPED PAGES.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>tt'The young girl sat perfectly still in the 
ttconfessional...

<b>1tINT. CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON
</b>
tGrady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is 
tin the midst of reading a story to the dozen college 
tSTUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>tt...listening to her father's boots scrape like 
ttchalk on the ancient steps of the church, then 
ttgrow faint, then disappear altogether.'

tAs he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, 
tperched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE 
tBANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:

<b>tWELCOME TO WORDFEST
</b>
tGRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if 
tthey've been on a field trip to the DMV.

tttttGRADY (cont'd) 
ttt(a wave of the pages) 
ttSo. .Anyone?

tA GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN 
tsitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES 
tLEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the 
twindow.

<b>tttttCARRIE MCWHIRTY 
</b>ttLet me get this straight. The girl with the 
ttbig lips is depressed because, each night, when 
tther father goes off to work at the bakery, her 
ttmother sneaks some mysterious lover into the 
tthouse. Not only does this girl have to listen 
ttto her mother working this guy in the next 
ttroom, she has to wash the sheets each morning 
ttbefore Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of 
ttthis, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy 
tttakes her to confession--only, once she gets in 
ttthe box, she gets a whiff of the priest and 
ttrealizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is 
ttthat it?

tJames Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY 
tOVERCOAT he wears.

<b>tttttCARRIE MCWHIRTY
</b>ttI mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttAll right. Let's try to keep it constructive, 
ttshall we? Howard, what about you?

<b>tttttHOWARD 
</b>ttI hated it.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThat's not exactly what I meant by 
ttconstructive, Howard.

<b>tttttHOWARD 
</b>ttI think James should try to be more 
ttconstructive. This is my second semester with 
tthim. His stories are brutal, man. They make me 
ttwant to kill myself.

tGRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. 
tThen--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the 
traised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN. 

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYes, Hannah?

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttI think maybe we're missing the point. It 
ttseems to me James' strength as a writer is that 
tthe doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us 
ttlike adults. He respects us enough to forget 
ttus. That takes . . . courage .

tGRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWell put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I 
ttthink. 
ttt(as the students rise) 
ttDon't forget about WordFest this weekend. And 
ttremember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to 
tttonight's cocktail party need to have them at 
ttthe Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.

tHannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThanks for that. He all right?

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttI think so. ..What about you?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttMe? Sure. Why?

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttJust checking.

tGRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY 
tBOOTS, then starts to exit himself. 

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttTurn out the light, please.

tGRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back 
tof the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the 
twail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.

<b>2tINT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 
</b>
tGRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL, 
t45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful 
tof SLICK PROGRAMS.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttt(calm but firm) 
ttNo, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for 
tttoday. This means we have no programs for the 
ttweekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at 
tt9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw 
ttHall and have absolutely no idea where they are 
ttgoing. 
ttt(shaking her head) 
ttIt's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.

tGRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. 
tThere is the slightest of hesitations, then....

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttProfessor Tripp.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttChancellor.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttI got the message you called.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI got the message you called too.

tThis hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and 
tcontinue on, without so much as a backward glance. 

<b>3tINT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING
</b>
tThe RADIO BLASTS as GRADY pops the glove box, removes a 
tJOINT as big as his pinky, and wheels his DARK MAROON '66 
tGALAXIE RAGTOP away from campus, cruising under another 
<b>tBANNER:
</b>
<b>tWELCOME TO WORDFEST FEBRUARY 26-28
</b>
<b>4tEXT. GALAXIE - MOVING.. - PITTSBURGH 
</b>
tGRADY cruises past the three rivers and modest 
tskyscrapers of downtown, sipping at the weed. 

<b>5tINT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT
</b>
tGRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half 
tthe length of the terminal, until...

<b>6tINT. ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT
</b>
t...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the 
ttunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black 
tdress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels.  
tGrinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the 
twoman's ear, then spots Grady.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttTripp!

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHow are you, Crabtree?

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttBrimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss 
ttAntonia. . .uh. . . .

<b>tttttWOMAN 
</b>ttSloviak.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttI took the liberty of inviting Antonia to 
tttonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you. 
ttTrip? ?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(a slight beat) 
ttThe more the merrier.

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK 
</b>ttTerry was telling me about you on the plane. 
ttIt was ail so interesting.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttI was explaining to Antonia how a book comes 
ttto be published. What you do as a writer, what 
ttI do as an editor...

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI sweat blood for five years and he checks for 
ttspelling.

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK 
</b>ttt(indicating Crabtree) 
ttThat's exactly what he said.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttWe know each other pretty well. 
ttt(to Grady) 
ttSo where's Emily?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttEmily?

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttYour wife.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttOh. We're picking her up. Downtown.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttPerfect. Well then, shall we?

tGRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the 
tarchitecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in 
ther spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.

<b>7tINT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tGRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak 
tsits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttDo you know how many times I've boarded an 
ttairplane praying someone like her would sit 
ttdown beside me? Particularly while I'm on my 
ttway to Pittsburgh.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttLay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great 
ttcities.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttIf it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no 
ttargument from me.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttShe's a transvestite.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttYou're stoned.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttShe's still a transvestite.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttMm.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttIsn't she?

tCrabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he 
twatches the carousel spin.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttSo how's the book?

tGRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so 
tsoon. He tries to act casual.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttIt's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort 
ttof. ..tinkering with it.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttGreat. I was hoping I could get a look at it 
ttsometime this weekend. Think that might be 
ttpossible?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . . 
ttjuncture .

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttI thought you were tinkering.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI just mean. . .

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttForget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, 
ttTripp. But...
ttt(pointedly)
tt ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?

tGRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's 
tface brightens again.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttAh. ..well now. What do you suppose that would 
ttbe?

tGRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto 
tthe carousel.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThat would be a tuba.

<b>8tINT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                8
</b>
tAs the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the 
tgreat city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, 
tthen glances in the rearview mirror.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThat perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It 
ttwouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttWhy yes. How did you know?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttLucky guess.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttYou didn't actually purchase this car, did 
ttyou. Trip??

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttIt was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.

<b>tttttCRABTREE 
</b>ttHe owes God money. You know, he queered 
tthimself for good with Esquire.

tGRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto 
tbutane.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHe said something about being between things.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttYeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken 
ttlegs.

<b>9tEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER  
</b>
tA YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS 
tUMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in 
tfront of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her 
tface. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger 
twindow.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHi, Tanya. 
ttt(to the others) 
ttThis is Tanya. My wife's secretary.

tCRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and 
tnods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.

<b>tttttTANYA 
</b>ttGrady.. ..Emily's not here.

tGRADY just smiles, nods.

tttttTANYA (cont'd) 
ttIs there anything I can do for you?

tGRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through 
tTanya's sad umbrella.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYou're leaking, Tanya.

tTanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttTrip? ?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttShe left me. Crabs.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttLeft you...?  Who? Emily?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThis morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttBut. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I 
ttmean, what are we doing here?

tGRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his 
twindshield, turns on the ignition.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI thought maybe I made it all up.

<b>10tEXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING 
</b>
tThrough the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and 
tselect students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of 
tcigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching 
thalt across the street, parks in front of another fire 
thydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a 
tGREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttThat's a nice greenhouse.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttIt's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttI thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, 
ttTripp.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttPiss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttOh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always 
ttdo.

<b>11tEXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE  
</b>
tAs the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears, 
triding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttWell, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you 
ttagain. 

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttChancellor. Don't you look ravishing.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttAren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to 
ttwonder if you were ever going to--oh!

tAs Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches 
tforward ...into Grady's arms.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttEasy there.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't 
ttknow how anyone actually walks in these things.

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttPractice.

tSara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific 
tcuriosity in her eye.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI don't believe we've met...

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttAntonia. Antonia Sloviak--

tJust then, a THICKLY-MUCSCLED DOG with very strange EYES 
tskitters around the corner, BARKING SAVAGELY in the general 
tdirection of Grady.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttPoe!

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttt(mildly)
ttThis wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it?

tPoe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the 
thardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around 
tand is barking at the living room.

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttWho ' s he barking at now?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHe's still barking at me. He's blind.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttPoe' Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.

tAs Poe simmers to a deep growl, GRADY leans forward.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI need to talk to you.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttThat's funny. I need to talk to you, too. 
ttt(strategy in her tone)
ttPerhaps you could put some of these coats in 
ttthe upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(reading her)
ttI don't believe I know where the upstairs 
ttguest room is.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttWell then. I'd better show you. Terry--

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttWe'll just make ourselves at home.
ttt(kneeling by Poe) 
ttWon't we, Poe? Yes, yes....

<b>12tINT. UPSTAIRS ROOM 
</b>
tGRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA. 
tAUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of 
tfamous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN 
tIN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with 
tPITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. As 
tSara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S 
tPENNANT hanging over the mantle.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttNew?

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttt(nodding)
ttWalter just got it back from the framer today.

tSara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the 
tpennant and down onto the coat-covered bed.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttYou go first.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttAll right. This morning--

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttI'm pregnant.

tA flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living  room below. 
tGRADY starts to speak.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttI'm sure.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWell. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI think Walter would find this a little more 
ttthan surprising.

tGRADY nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttEmily left me this morning.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttShe's left before...

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttShe's left the room before. She always came 
ttback.

tSara nods. Considers this.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttSo. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry 
tteach other, and have this baby, right? Simple.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSimple.

tGRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling. Sara sniffs the coat 
tlying beneath her. Miss Sloviak's coat.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttIs that Cristaile?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHm.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttt(weary)
ttMy God, I wear the same scent as a 
tttransvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: 
ttshe?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttIf she's not now, Terry will make sure she is 
ttby the end of the evening.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttHas he asked to see the book yet?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttAnd? Are you going to tell him?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttNo. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm 
ttgoing to do.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttt(distantly) 
ttNeither do 1.

tGRADY starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI guess you're going to have to chew it off 
ttthen.

<b>13tINT. LIVING ROOM - GASKELL HOUSE   
</b>
tPoe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by 
tMiss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree, 
treturning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds 
tMISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttWalter! I see you've met my friend.

<b>tttttWALTER GASKELL 
</b>ttYes . She' s charming.

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttt(taking her drink)
ttWalter's been telling me the most fascinating 
ttthings about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?

<b>tttttWALTER GASKELL
</b>ttJoe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my 
ttcontention that their marriage tapped into the 
ttvery id of American popular culture. Joe 
ttDiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, 
ttthe Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be 
ttcontroversial, I personally believe every 
ttwoman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn 
ttMonroe.

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttOh, I couldn't agree more.

<b>tNEW ANGLE
</b>
tGRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and 
tchanges course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN 
t("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's 
tclear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting 
tthe make on Hannah Green.

<b>tttttQ
</b>ttAnd while my latest has been on the New York 
ttTimes bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't 
tthelp but lament that my first book, which 
ttcontains what I consider my finest writing, was 
ttremaindered in less than five. So, I find 
ttmyself conflicted.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttAsk him if he's conflicted about his house in 
ttthe Hamptons.

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttt(brightening)
ttGrady.

tQ eyes GRADY over his wine glass.

<b>tttttQ 
</b>ttHello.. .Professor.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttQ,. Hannah's had two stories published in The 
ttParis Review. You'd best dust off the 'A' 
ttmaterial for her.

tAs GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the 
tother way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN 
tTWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN.

<b>tttttMAN IN TWEED 
</b>ttt(to short man)
ttA supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm 
tttelling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob 
ttlaundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa? 
ttLet me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot 
ttbookstore like they need another goddamn cow.
ttt(as GRADY passes) 
ttGrady!

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHello, Nathan.

<b>tttttMAN IN TWEED
</b>ttMy God, I haven't seen you since, what? The 
ttPEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for 
ttyou, Grady.
ttt(to his friend)
ttGRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter,

tThe short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand.

<b>tttttSHORT MAN
</b>ttDouglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I 
ttsay Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon 
ttof late twentieth century fiction. I've had it 
tton my Graduate Studies syllabus three years 
ttrunning.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(pulling away) 
ttNo wonder it's still in print.

tAs GRADY flees, he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette.

<b>tttttWOMAN WITH CIGARETTE
</b>tt...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy 
ttfucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to 
ttdeal with the sweater thing. They'll discover 
ttthe cancer in your heart every time, but God 
ttforbid they find a decent dry cleaner.

<b>14tEXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT   
</b>
tGRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from 
this pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around 
tthe side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE 
taccosts him.

<b>tttttMAN'S VOICE 
</b>ttThere you are.

tGRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he 
tsees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the 
tperson to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in 
tthe kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.  

<b>tttttWALTER
</b>ttI could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in 
tthere. You haven't seen it, have you?

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if 
ttI was sitting on it.

<b>tttttWALTER
</b>ttYou'd recognize it if you tasted it.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI doubt it, darling.

<b>tttttWALTER
</b>ttt(angling & bottle to the light)
ttWell, Q certainly will. And, given that he 
ttwill be addressing 500 people in little over an 
tthour...

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttYou want to keep him happy.

<b>tttttWALTER 
</b>ttIf he' s happy. . .
ttt(kissing her as he exits) 
ttI'm happy.

tAs Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in 
tthe quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, 
tshe takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, 
treturning to the clamor inside her house.

tGRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of 
tLIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching 
thim from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's 
tgarage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught 
teavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the 
tporch.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttJames?

tJames Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a 
tGREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at 
twhat appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttIt's fake.

tJames' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY 
tpeers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The 
tsliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED 
<b>tPISTOL.
</b>
<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttIt was my mother's. She won it in a penny 
ttarcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic 
ttschool.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttIt's very convincing.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttIt used to shoot these little paper caps, but 
ttthey don't make them anymore. The caps.

tGRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttIt's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry 
ttrabbits' feet...

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>tt...You carry firearms.

tAs GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass 
tbriefly over the jay. GRADY
tnotices, offers.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttNo, thank you. I don't like to lose control of 
ttmy emotions.

tGRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI'm not supposed to be here, in case you were 
ttwondering. I crashed. I mean, not 
ttintentionally...

tJames nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be 
tseen in a window, still fending off the determined Q.

tttttJAMES LEER (cont'd)
tt...but the other night, Hannah and I were 
tttogether, at the movies, and she asked me. 
ttSince she was coming. So I ended up coming. 
ttToo.

tGRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttAre you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttNo! What gave you that idea?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttRelax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent 
tther a room.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttShe likes old movies like I do, that's ail.
ttt(glancing back at the window) 
ttBesides, she doesn't really know me. She 
ttthinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's 
ttbecause she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttMaybe it's because she's beautiful and she 
ttknows it and try as she might to not let that 
ttscrew her up, it's inevitable that it will in 
ttsome way.

tJames looks away from the window, at Grady.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttYou're not like my other teachers, Professor 
ttTripp.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYou're not like my other students, James. So 
ttwhat was the movie you two saw?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttHuh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and 
ttFrances Farmer.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttShe went crazy, Frances Farmer.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttSo did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSounds like a good one.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttt(a crooked smile) 
ttIt's not bad.

tGRADY considers James' fragile face.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttListen, James, about this afternoon. In 
ttworkshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a 
ttbit out of control.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttThey really hated it. I think they hated it 
ttmore than any of the other ones.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWell...

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttIt doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to 
ttwrite.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(truly impressed) 
ttReally? That's remarkable.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in 
ttbed I figure them out. The stories.

tAs James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY 
tlooks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat. 
tLike a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against 
tthe modest bulk of the cap gun.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYou cold, James?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttt(distant) 
ttA little.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSo what are you doing out here?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttIt's colder in there. -

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(laughing) 
ttYou're right.

tJames blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that 
the's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhouse

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttActually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought 
tt...I thought I'd come out here and take a look 
ttat it. You don't see one of those every day. It 
ttlooks like heaven...

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHeaven?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI saw a movie once. Part of it took place in 
ttheaven. Everyone wore white and lived in 
ttcrystal houses. Like that. At least that's the 
ttway I remember it...

tAbruptly, James glances at his watch.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttI should be going.

tJames turns away, then stops. He stands like this a 
tmoment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand.

tttttJAMES LEER (cont'd) 
ttGoodbye, Professor Tripp.

tGRADY hesitates, then shakes James' hand. James moves off 
tthen, leaving the light of the house behind.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttJames. 
ttt(as he stops)
ttDon't leave just yet. There's something I 
ttthink you ought to see.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttI'll miss my bus.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThis is worth it.

tJames looks conflicted.

tttttGRADY (cont'd) 
ttTrust me.

<b>15tINT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER  
</b>
tIt's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past 
tthe departing guests and toward the stairs.        

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttHey, you two.

tGRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer.

tttttHANNAH GREEN (cont'd) 
ttAre you riding with me, James?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttNo, I'm going ho--

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHe's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttAil right. By the way, his friend...?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThe answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. 
ttWhere are they exactly?

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttHere we are!

tCRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss 
tSloviak. Her lipstick is blurry.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttt(spying James) 
ttNell, hello there.

tCRABTREE steps down the stairs, hand extended. James 
tLeer's pale fingers rise as if on a string.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttJames. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttJames'll know about George Sanders.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttGeorge Sanders?

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttMr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders 
ttkilled himself, only he couldn't remember how.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttPills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel 
ttroom.

tThe few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but 
tCrabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttHow comprehensive of you.

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttOh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie 
ttsuicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttThere's so many...

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttJust a few then. The big ones.

tJames glances at the loose group of people around him, 
twatching, then...

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttPier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles 
ttBoyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 
tt1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an 
ttaccident, but, you know. . . 
ttt(a trace of irony)
ttHe was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took 
ttpills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he 
tthung himself. He wrote his suicide note in 
ttlipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more 
ttpills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget 
ttwhen. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot 
tthimself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979. 
ttEverett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret 
ttSullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. 
ttGig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 
tt1978. There are more but I don't know if you 
ttwould have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara 
ttBlandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttI haven't heard of half of those.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttYou did them alphabetically.

tJames turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James 
tblinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs 
tshyly, looks away.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttThat's just how my brain works, I guess.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttFascinating. Listen, why don't you come out 
ttwith us after the lecture. There's a place on 
ttthe Hill I always get Trip to take me.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttActually. ..I just want to go home.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttOh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants 
ttto go home. Besides, faculty will be present. 
ttJust think of it as a field trip.

tAs he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if 
tto say: "Bring him."   MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James 
tglacially as we CUT TO:

<b>tBLACK
</b>
tThe dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR 
topens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of 
tMARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day.

<b>16tINT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE   
</b>
tGRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the 
tphotograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN-
tSTRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN 
tJACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttIs that really it?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThat's really it.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttThe one she wore on her wedding day?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSo I'm told.

tJames, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide 
tgarments, stands speechless.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(cont'd) 
ttGo ahead.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttReally?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttReally.

tJames swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he 
treaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, 
tbarely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttThey're glass. The buttons.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttLike the lady herself.

tGRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a 
tbit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the 
tjacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttShe was small. Most people don't know that. 
ttThe shoulders are small.
ttt(touching the satin)
ttIt looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time 
ttshe wore it. That day. She must've felt so 
tt...happy.

tGRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket, 
tlifts it lightly.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttIt's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... 
ttsomething. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth 
ttabout how much he pays for these things.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttYou're really good friends with the 
ttChancellor, aren't you?

tGrady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains 
tunchanged, consumed with the jacket.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(carefully)
ttPretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, 
tttoo.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI guess you must be, if you know the 
ttcombination to his closet and he doesn't mind 
ttyour being here in their bedroom like this.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttRight.

tA DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The 
tCLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom 
twindow, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN 
tDS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWe, better skedaddle. Close that closet-- 
ttJames? You ail right?

tJames is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed, 
tknapsack between his knees, head in hands.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing 
ttthat jacket that belonged to her. It just 
ttlooks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a 
ttcloset. Maybe I'm just a little sad.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttMaybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself 
tttonight.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttYou mean, with your wife leaving you and ail? 
ttt(off Grady's look)
ttHannah mentioned something about it.   About a 
ttnote.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we 
ttshould go now.

tWithout thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light, 
tleaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today.

tJames just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.

<b>17tINT. HALLWAY
</b>
tA LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY
tas he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to 
tthe ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in 
tGrady's direction.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttOkay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .

tGRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward 
tand sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttJesus!

tGRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the 
tground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls his 
thead in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttGet off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!

tPoe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his 
thead back and forth, back and forth, over and over, 
tgrowling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his 
tthroat, until there is a sharp...

<b>tCRACK! CRACK!
</b>
tPoe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily 
tonto Grady's legs. GRADY
tturns. James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the 
tlittle pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen.

tGRADY looks at James. Then Poe. Then back to James.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttShit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttI had to. Didn't I?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttCouldn't you've just pulled him off me?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttNo! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1 
ttthought --

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttOkay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on 
ttme.

tGRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through 
tlife with a slight overbite.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttDo you have a mirror? It's the best way to see 
ttif someone's breathing.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHe's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead 
ttdog when I see one.

tJames looks miserably at Poe.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttWhat are we going to do?

tGRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttFirst you're going to give me that little cap 
ttgun of yours.

</b>ttProfessor Tripp? Can I  ask you a question?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYea, James.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttWhat are we going to do with...

tJames glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange 
tblue eyes gleaming.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI don't know. I'm still trying to figure out 
tthow to tell the Chancellor I murdered her 
tthusband's dog.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttYou?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttTrust me, James, when the family pet's been 
ttassassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear 
ttone of her students was the triggerman.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttDoes she want to hear it was one of her

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI've got tenure.

<b>19tEXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS) 
</b>
tAs sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of 
tThaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a 
tspace between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttOkay.

tJames totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs 
tlooking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps 
tforward, and takes the hind legs.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttHe's still a little warm.

tThey lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until 
tthere is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttYuck.

tGRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttThat's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a 
ttsuitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost 
ttperfectly.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(searching)
ttThat's just what they used to say in the ads. 
ttCome on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttWhose tuba is that anyway? 

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttMiss Sloviak's.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttCan I ask you something about her?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttShe is. Ah. Here we go...

tGRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane-
tsize bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of 
tboxers.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttOh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--
ttgay?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttMost of the time he is, James. Some of the 
tttime he isn't. Now what do we have here?

tGRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a 
tpair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttLooks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That 
ttshould take the pinch out of my ankle.
ttt(handing the bottle to James) 
ttHave one.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttNo thanks. I'm fine without them.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttRight. That's why you were standing in the 
ttChancellor's back yard twirling that little cap 
ttgun of yours tonight.  You're fine, all right, 
ttyou're fit as a fucking fiddle.

tGRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth, 
tdrinks down two number 3's, then looks at James.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that.

tRecklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, 
tand tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later, 
the spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill 
tfrom the lapel of his jacket.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHow 'bout we try that again.

<b>20tINT. AUDITORIUM - LATER
</b>
tOn the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium.

<b>tttttWALTER

ttbooks, so welcome if you will, the man those of 
ttus who know him simply call.. .Q.

tAs the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the 
tauditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an 
topen space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID 
twith a GOATEE .who regards him warily.
<b> 
</b><b>tttttQ 
</b>ttGood evening.

tGRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, 
twatching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting 
tuntil the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory 
thush. Finally, he speaks again.

<b>tttttQ 
</b>ttI am a writer.

tAs the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He 
tglances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a 
tsimilar look of bafflement.

tttttQ (cont'd)
ttAs a writer, one thing you learn is that 
tteveryone you encounter has a story. Every 
ttbartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an 
ttidea or a. story that would make a "great book" 
ttor a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has 
ttan idea. (gestures to the audience)
ttBut, how do you go from there to here? How do 
ttyou go from having an idea to having a book? 
ttHow do you get across? What is the bridge, the 
ttbridge that allows you to walk on air from the 
ttshoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of 
ttaccomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is 
ttworth the telling, faith that you have the 
ttwherewithal to tell it, faith that the 
ttcarefully woven structure you create won't 
ttcollapse beneath you...

tGRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking 
tand glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far 
tEXIT. A blink later, she is gone.

tttttQ (cont'd)
tt...and faith that when you get to the other 
ttside someone will be waiting who gives a damn 
ttabout the tale you have to tell.

tGRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own 
tHEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a 
tthread forty feet above his head...

tAbruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: 
tbubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the 
tauditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, 
tJames ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows 
taway, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady.

tGRADY blinks, turns to James.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI'll be right back.

<b>21tINT. LOBBY

tGRADY bursts through the auditorium doors and into the

tbehind a table arrayed with the BOOKS of attending authors, 
tglance up as GRADY limps toward the restrooms. 

<b>22tINT. CORRIDOR

tGRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor 
tbegins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his

tSara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttThen stand up. I'm too old for all this 
ttroiling around on the floor.

tGRADY lets her pull him up, watches her light a 
tcigarette.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWell...

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttDon't. I know what you're going to say.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttNo, really, Sara, I don't think you--

</b>ttYou love Emily. I know that. And you need to 
ttstay with her.

</b>ttI don't think I really have a choice in, that. 
ttEmily left me.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttShe'll come back. That's why I'm going to.

tGRADY watches her flip her hand up, bring the cigarette 
tto her lips, and inhale ...then grimace and drop it to the 
tfloor.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttNot have it.

</b>ttNo. There's no way. I mean, don't you think

ttNo you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. 
ttAnd fuck you for "saying. . .

tSomewhere deep in the building, APPLAUSE swells.

ttHe must be finishing. We should go.

tGRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his 
tcoat.  As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTERS 
tto the floor.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttWho's gun is that?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttIt's-it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

tBefore GRADY can close his hand, Sara has it in her own.

</b>ttHeavy. Smells like gunpowder.

</b>ttCaps.

tShe points it-at Grady's chest. He smiles nervously.

</b>ttWoah! The doors made so much noise!

tAs they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear.

</b>ttThis is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry

tAs Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the 
tlobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak.

</b>ttI need a ride.

</b>ttI'm your man.

tAs the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK 
tstares at what's wedged up against her suitcase.

tMISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in, 
tunzips her suitcase.

tAs GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top 
tbutton of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered 
tCOSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the 
tglovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL 
tPOLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS.

</b>ttCouldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttJames is. ..I don't know...

tTony angles the rearview mirror toward himself.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHe's writing his name in water.

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttLike most editors, he really wants to be a

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttThat sounds like a fancy excuse for being a

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHe'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the

tTony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks.

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttYou mean because his career's ruined and all?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttJesus. Is that what he told you?

<b>tttttMISS SLOVIAK
</b>ttHe said he hasn't had a success in ten years

tof his own swollen eyes.

</b>ttThat'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese

tGRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony 
tsmirks.

</b>ttFigures. It's like the kind of gun Bette Davis 
ttwould carry. In a little beaded purse?

tGRADY studies the gun in Tony's hand, then glances at the

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI'd better go. I think I may have to rescue

tHannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY 
tenters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She beckons 
twith a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her 
tglistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated 
tshrug and she points.

tCRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James 
tslouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the

</b>ttPrimarily. Although I gather you two staged a

</b>ttI'm sure. Where is everyone?

</b>ttSara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to

tGRADY cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's 
tcopped on Poe, but James is winking out. His head drifts 
tback against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttJesus. He's out.

tCRABTREE glances over, nods.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttHe has a book.

</b>ttNo. Not yet he isn't.

tGRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes

tGRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens 
tone bloodshot eye to regard them.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER

tJames' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady.

tsomething to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair 
tfrom James Leer's forehead.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttDo?

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttI just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to

tGRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then 
tcatches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The 
ttile that would reflect his head is missing.

</b>ttAre you holding me up or am I dragging you

tAs GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls 
tinto a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady.

</b>ttAil right. In my office.

tAs GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his 
tface.

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttHey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up.

tGRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and 
tdrive away. He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has 
this hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears.

tVernon Hardapple.

tCRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>
ttAll right, what's the matter?

tback in front of Grady's grille.

</b>ttShit.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttBack up. Go out the other way.

tGRADY throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then 
tturns up a one-way street. He shoots down the alley behind 
tthe Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street, ..and watches 
tin amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high 
twooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie.

tAs GRADY pinches the brakes, Vernon grins.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttNow what?

</b>ttt(mischievously)
ttYou could always go over him.

tThen, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his 
theels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto 
tthe Galaxie's big hood. He -lands on his ass, slides 
tsmoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the 
tnight.

tAs Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James 
tLeer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above 
tthe door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with 
tonly dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He 
ttakes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.

tThe room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes 
tof light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he 
tfinds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T-
tshirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling 
thand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet 
tCoke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but 
this eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He 
tsteps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his 
tdisappointment--only the red cowboy boots.

tHe picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits.

tJames Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old

tknapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects 
this ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack.

tSomething yellow. Something soft.

tGRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing 
ta magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET 
tfrom James Leer's ratty green knapsack. 

tGRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking 
tvery tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the

twell-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of 
tGrady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER, 
tpads and pens neatly arranged alongside.

tA BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate 
tmosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS, 
tframed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's

tThere are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck

ttThank you.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYou're welcome.

tGRADY sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee 
tfrom the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the center 
tof a galaxy of previous coffee rings. Next, he takes a 
tclean piece of paper, balls it up, and-with ritual 
tprecision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP 
tthat crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room.

tAll net.

tA 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and, without 
tfurther ceremony, GRADY
tturns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC 
tand SPACES to the top right corner, TYPES:

tt(beat) 2611

tIn other words: Page 2611.

tCLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS, 
tthe KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that 
tgrows and grows until, finally, it just ....Stops.

</b>ttJames I  

tGRADY awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's 
tquizzical face floating like a cloud above him.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI'm okay. I just lost my balance.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttI put you on the floor.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttOh.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI thought you might--l don't know-- swallow 
ttyour tongue or something.
ttt(nodding to Grady's robe)
ttI guess you really miss her, huh?

tGRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets 
tof the robe, its overall fuzziness.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHuh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write 
ttin it.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI guess there's probably a story behind that.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThere is, but it's not that interesting.

tJames nods. Down the hallway, in another room, the 
<b>tTELEPHONE RINGS.
</b>
<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttWant me to get that?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSure.

tAs James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises 
tdelicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to 
tsee a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttt(returning)
ttHe didn't give his name.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWho?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttThe guy on the phone.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWhat'd he say?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttHe wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here 
ttand drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 
ttwith black interior.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWhat'd you tell him?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttGood, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be 
ttsure to mention the back door pops open with a 
ttcouple hard shakes to the right.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or 
ttsomething. Is that single-spaced?

tJames has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on 
tGrady's desk.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttAfraid so.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttThat's a big book you're writing.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI think it's sort of writing itself at this 
ttpoint.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttWow, Hannah always swore you were working, 
ttbut--

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttBut . . . ?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttNothing, it's just that,, well, it's been 
ttawhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some 
ttpeople--some of the kids in workshop--thought 
ttmaybe you were...

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWashed up?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttBlocked.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttAh. I don't believe in writer's block.

tJames takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttNo kidding.

tA LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch 
tCrabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, 
tmaterialize in the hallway.

<b>tttttCRABTREE
</b>ttGood morning, boys. James.

tJames waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(re: James' "attire") 
ttIf-you 're planning on staying for breakfast, 
ttI'd put on something a little less comfortable 
ttif I were you.

tAs GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the 
tpage curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare 
tinto the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE 
tseems to have made him suddenly queasy.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttProfessor Tripp?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHm.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttHow did I get here last night?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttNo one seems to know where you live, James. 
ttHannah thought you'd like my couch.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttAnd ...and before that. Did I do anything? 
ttAnything bad?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWell, James, you did shoot the Head of the 
ttEnglish Department's dog and steal his most 
ttprized piece of memorabilia.

tAs James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY 
tlooks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now 
tparked at the bottom of his driveway.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttDo yourself a favor, James ...Hide.

tA POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the

tappears.

tJames lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the 
tsleeping bag, straining to hear.

<b>tttttOFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.)
</b>tt...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone. 
ttSomeone you didn't know. Who seemed out of

<b>48tEXT. FRONT PORCH 
</b>
tGRADY is  scratching his head in mock thought.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWell, there's always people you don't know at 
ttthese things, but I can't say there was anybody 
ttparticularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one 
ttguy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.

<b>tttttOFFICER PUPCIK 
</b>ttA jockey? You mean, like--

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHorses, right. Vernon something...
ttt(thinking... )
ttHardpple

tPupcik stops on his pad, looks up.

<b>tttttOFFICER PUPCIK 
</b>ttHardapple?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI could be wrong. What happened anyway?

<b>tttttOFFICER PUPCIK
</b>ttHuh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's 
ttcloset. And the dog's missing.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThat's weird.

<b>tttttOFFICER PUPCIK
</b>ttWe figure the perpetrator let him out. He's 
ttblind and we figure he just wandered off and 
ttgot run over.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThe perpetrator.

<b>tttttOFFICER PUPCIK
</b>ttNo, the dog.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttJust kidding.

tPupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under "Dealing 
tWith Assholes."

<b>tttttOFFICER PUPCIK
</b>ttOne other thing. About this kid, this student 
ttof yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know 
tthow I could get in touch with him, would you?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI might have his number on campus.

<b>tttttOFFICER PUPCIK 
</b>ttThat's all right. We'll find him.

tPete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and 
tturns away. GRADY frowns, starts to close the door...

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN (O.S.) 
</b>ttThere you are...

tGRADY stiffens, then turns to find Hannah Green across 
tthe room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots, looking ail dewy-
teyed and delectable.

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttI thought we were going to talk. Last night.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttOh. Well. I...

tHannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up 
ther thighs.

<b>tttttHANNAH GREEN
</b>ttIt's okay. ..I'm here when you want me.

tGRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes 
tthrough the swinging door into the kitchen. A THUMPING is 
theard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down 
tthe last few steps of the stairway. He watches Pete Pupcik 
tdrive away in his big police car.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttWhat do we do now?

#####Before GRADY can reply, .the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next to him 
<b>#####RINGS.

</b>ttHello?

</b>ttGrady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You 
ttwon't believe what's happened.

</b>ttCould you hold on a minute, honey?

tWith a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever-
tso- gently ...hang up the phone.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHow 'bout we get the hell out of here?

<b>49tEXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) 
</b>
tJames, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath 
this ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack 
tswinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of 
<b>tKEYS.
</b>
<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYou start her up.

tAs GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice 
tblanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the 
tkeys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides 
tbehind the steering wheel.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttt(as the engine roars) 
ttHow's that?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWell done, James.

tAs GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the

tttttGRADY (cont'd) 
ttShit!

tJames blinks, pokes his head out the window.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttYou're bleeding. Professor Tripp.

<b>50tINT. AISLE - MARKET - MORNING (LATER)   
</b>
tGRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a 
tneighborhood MARKET. GRADY
thas a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering 
this ragged thumb.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWhere exactly do you live, James?

tJames, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of 
tORANGE JUICE, stops.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttApparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as 
ttto the location of your apartment.

tGRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic 
thand basket, begins to move down the aisle.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked 
ttout. I was asked to leave.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI guess there's probably a story behind that.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttThere is, but it's not that interesting.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSo where have you been staying?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttt(a long pause) 
ttThe bus station.

tGRADY stares incredulously at James.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttIt's not -so bad. I know the night janitor. 
ttAnd there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(trying to fathom this)

</b>ttWho?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI don't know...
ttt(unconvincingly)
ttMe.

tGRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and, 
tabruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling 
ton the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is 
tstaring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST 
<b>tPAPERBACK. GRADY
</b>tfrowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a 
tspray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.

tA thought evolves.

tttttGRADY (cont'd)
ttt(the balloons)
ttWhat do you think of these?

tJames takes another chug from his jug, nods.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttNice.

<b>51tEXT. GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING 
</b>
tGrady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared 
tice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in 
tfront of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off.

<b>52tINT. GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS  
</b>
tGRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches 
tsomething on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James 
tglances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the 
tglovebox, then peers at the house.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttt(the house) 
ttIsn't this...?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHm.

tGRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange 
tjuice jug between James legs. It's about half-down.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYou better ease off that stuff, James. It's 
ttpretty acidic.

tJames takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, 
tstudies it curiously.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI can't help myself. I don't know what's the 
ttmatter with me.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttShit, James, you're hungover. What do you 
ttthink's the matter with you?

tAs GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers 
tthe ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets 
tthe donut in precisely the same place.

<b>53tINT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER
</b>
tThrough the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the 
tballoon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the 
tballoon down, and steps back, considering the placement.

<b>tttttSARA O.S.) 
</b>ttFeeling guilty?

tGRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized 
tbehind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands.

tttttSARA (cont'd) 
ttI can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttTotally.  I'm sorry. A lot was happening this 
ttmorning. Can you talk?

tSara nods, moves the ficus to another table.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttWalter's on campus, being the good soldier for 
ttWordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole 
ttMarilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, 
tttoo.

</b>ttI-heard.

</b>ttYou heard? How?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttA twelve-year-old policeman came by the house 
ttthis morning.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttDid you confess?

tGRADY looks up, mildly alarmed.

</b>ttYour fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

</b>ttReally? That was fast.

</b>ttt(frowning)

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttAll right.

tSara settles back, folds her arms. Waiting.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b><b>ttI...
</b>
tAs GRADY stares into Sara's eyes, things begin to blur. 

tttttGRADY (cont'd)
tt ...want to be with you.

tSara looks at him.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttGee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.  I 
ttdon't know whether to swoon or smirk.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttReally, Sara, I...

tSara holds up one gloved hand.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI believe you. I believe you want to be with

</b>ttI know that. I know what's at stake here...

</b>ttNo, I don't think you do. And besides... I 
tthaven't decided yet.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttAbout the baby.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttThat ...and you.

tGRADY goes still, watches Sara strip off the gloves, drop 
tthem on  a table.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI'm not going to draw the map for you on this 
ttone, Grady. Times like these you have to do 
ttyour own navigating.

tSara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the 
tstreet.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttWho's that sitting in your car?

</b>ttJames Leer.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttWhat's he doing out there?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI'm sort of helping him work through some

tSara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttIsn't he lucky.

tGRADY watches her ripple across the glass, head for the 
thouse, and wave. James, slumped low in the Galaxie, offers 
ta limp hand in return, but it's too late.

tShe's already gone.

</b>ttYeah, well, actually. . .

ttThe moment didn't really present itself.

tglances at him. At the orange juice jug.

ttYou' re not planning on puking in my car, are

tNothing.

tblinks, looks embarrassed.

ttI mean. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just...

tJames peers out the window at passing landscape.

ttknow what those houses are like. I know what

tJames turns, eyes flashing with surprise.

tttttGRADY (cont'd)
ttHannah mentioned something about an aunt.

tJames nods vaguely, then reaches into the ashtray, takes 
ta JOINT between his fingers, sniffs it.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttHumboldt County?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(surprised)
ttMaybe...

<b>tttttJAMES LEER

</b>ttYour father worked in a mannequin factory?

</b>ttSeitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn.

</b>ttWhatever kind they wanted her to be.

<b>tttttGRADY 
</b>ttt(in disbelief)
ttJames Leer, are you telling me your mother was 
tta stripper?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttI'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. 
ttAnd he should know. He ran half a dozen men's

</b>ttDidn't you say your Mom went to Catholic 
ttschool?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER 
</b>ttWhen we fall, we fall hard.

</b>ttAmazing.

tGRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then 
tnotices-with surprise--James has his hand out.

tttttGRADY (cont'd) 
ttI thought you were the guy who didn't like to 
ttlose control of his emotions.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttMaybe I just needed the moment to present

<b>55tEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY .(ONE HOUR LATER)

tJOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers.

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttThis is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy

tGRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against 
tthe glass of the living room window, squints inside. 
tNothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the 
thood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's 
tsitting in the indentation.


<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttSomeone jumped on your car with their butt ..-

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttHow can you tell?

<b>tttttJAMES LEER
</b>ttYou can see the outline of a butt.

tAs GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box.

tttttJAMES LEER (cont'd)
ttWant one. They're incredible. Incredible.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSmoke the rest of that joint, James, and you 
ttcan start on the box.

</b>ttMaybe she didn't come here.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttShe came here. We'll just wait. In the

tJames stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch 
tdoor.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttRelax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since 
ttshe was twelve years old. And your hips are as

tdrops onto ail fours.

<b>59tINT. LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

</b>ttIt feels really... good. ..here.

tGrady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a 
tDUFFEL BAG open on the floor, its contents a tangle of 
tquickly-packed clothes. Everything else in the room feels 
tof another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a 
tPRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown.

tOne photograph lies face down. GRADY turns it over and 
tfinds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, 
tstanding in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their 
twedding day.

tJames stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the

tthem. A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.

</b>ttBut, last night...

tShe slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at

tJust then, Crabtree's VOICE bellows in the hallway

tGRADY looks anxiously toward the door.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThe aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James

</b>ttI told you, Sewickly Heights.

</b>ttWhat? Ohhhh. Is that... it?

tCRABTREE cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked 
ton Grady's desk.

</b>ttHonestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would

</b>ttGee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to

</b>ttBad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit

ttYou're still the best teacher I ever had.

tOn this,  Pete Pupcik pulls away, leaving GRADY standing 
ton the curb, watching the back of James' head, framed in 
tthe rear  window of the police car, growing smaller.

</b>ttThis is not what the university has in mind

tGrady, detecting something in Sara's tone, turns, watches

ttYou didn't happen to call the house last

</b>ttHe told me.

</b>ttAnd what did you say?

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI said it didn't sound like you. 

tSara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her

tturns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt 
twhich claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away."

this manuscript and exits.

the walks toward the buildings in the distance.

<b>tttttCARRIE MCWHIRTY
</b>ttIf you're looking for Hannah, she's on the 
ttaisle.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttNo...

tBut GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the 
taisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming. 
tThe Goatee Kid sits close beside her.

<b>tttttCARRIE MCWHIRTY
</b>ttWho's that guy she's with? Didn't he used to 
ttbe in workshop?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttJeff. He comes from a long line of tango 
ttdancers.

<b>116tINT. MAIN STAGE
</b>
tWalter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes.

<b>tttttWALTER
</b>ttAnd now, as those of you who've been with us 
ttin previous years know, we have a tradition of 
ttsorts here at WordFest. I'm speaking, of 
ttcourse, of The Plums.

tAn anticipatory BUZZ sweeps through the audience as 
tWalter begins to read from a separate list.

<b>tttttWALTER
</b>ttThis weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock, 
ttfound a publisher for her children's book. The 
ttLoneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.

<b>117tINT. BACK ROW - THAW HALL^
</b>
tAs a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause, 
tGRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his 
tsurprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the 
tfront row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily 
tcomplacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing 
tCRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.

<b>tttttWALTER
</b>ttAnd Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for 
tthis City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has 
ttfound a home with Putnam for his new Three 
ttRivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.

tA SHORT, BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walter's VOICE 
ttakes a shift in tone.

<b>tttttWALTER
</b>ttNow, this next one, I think, is especially 
ttexciting to announce, because it concerns a 
ttstudent here at the university. Our own James 
ttLeer, a sophomore in English literature, has 
ttfound a publisher for his first novel, which I 
ttbelieve is called The Lovely Parade.

tGRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile 
twarmly toward the front row. CRABTREE gives James a jab in 
tthe ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises. Stunned, 
tCarrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her.

<b>tttttCARRIE MCWHIRTY 
</b>ttI have a class with him.

tJames hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the 
tAPPLAUSE slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether.

<b>tttttCARRIE MCWHIRTY
</b>ttThe guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know 
ttwhat I mean.

tGrady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups 
tHi his hands around his mouth.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttTake a bow, James!

tJames turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish 
tgrin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and 
ttakes his first sweet public bow.

tttttGRADY (cont'd) 
ttt(softly)
ttWonder Boy.

<b>tttttWALTER
</b>ttAnd finally--and perhaps not least 
ttimportantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has 
ttalso decided to publish my own book--a critical 
ttexploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and 
ttJoe DiMaggio and its function in American 
ttmythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled 
ttThe Last American Marriage.     "

tWild, obsequious APPLAUSE. GRADY smiles cynically, 
twatches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own.     
<b>t. :
</b>
<b>tttttWALTER 
</b>ttUntil next year. Thank you, everyone.

tThe LIGHTS come up. As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE 
tshakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah 
tGreen down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms 
taround James.

tGRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when 
tsuddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder. She says 
tsomething congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door. 
tGRADY blinks, scrambles up.

<b>118tINT. CORRIDOR - THAW HALL - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tGRADY bursts into the corridor.'

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSara!

tIts empty. Quiet. GRADY pauses. Somewhere, a HEAVY METAL 
tDOOR CLOSES. GRADY rushes on.

<b>119tINT. NEW CORRIDOR
</b>
tGrady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a DOOR. He 
tmoves to it, pushes past...

<b>120tINT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
t...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. He leans 
tout over the railing, peers down. It's a steep drop, very. 
tsteep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of 
tbasement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, and 
ta COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE.

tGRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes 
tagainst it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his 
tailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of- 
tmarijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating 
tatop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The 
tSOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're 
tSara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing.

tIt's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYo, Traxler.

<b>tttttTRAXLER 
</b>ttt(looking up)
ttHey, Professor Tripp.

tGRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttDo you get high, Sam?

<b>tttttTRAXLER
</b>ttOnly when I'm working.

tGRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc.  It 
tpinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's 
tfeet.

<b>tttttTRAXLER 
</b>ttHoly shit. Are you serious?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttAs a heart attack.

<b>tttttTRAXLER
</b>ttThanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here...

tGRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy 
tnow. His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on 
ta window ledge-and as he starts to drop...

t...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON 
tcaroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttGrady, what are you doing, you idiot?

tGRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttLooking for you.

tHe wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL 
<b>tGOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS...
</b>
tfaintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's 
tname, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH 
tupward until we see that she is...

tKISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.

<b>121tINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
tGRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue 
tplastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the 
tcurtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips 
tslowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW 
tfall outside.

tThe DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then 
tthe curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. 
tHis NAMETAG says GREENHUT.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI passed out.

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttYou did.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI've been doing that a lot lately.

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttSo I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of 
ttmarijuana, I understand.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttDo you think that's why I've been having 
ttthese...
ttt(grabbing James' term)
tt ... spells?

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttHow long have you been having them?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThe last month maybe.

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttHow long have you been smoking marijuana?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSpiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttThat's probably not the problem, then. What 
ttabout your lifestyle. Any major changes 
ttrecently?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI've been trying to finish a book...

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttAnd your wife left you.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttIs that in my chart?

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttI spoke with the woman who saved your life. 
ttYou're lucky she came along when she did.

tGRADY considers the larger ramifications of this 
tstatement

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI know.

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttt(tapping the glucose bottle)
ttYou need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An 
ttinternist. And I think you really ought to 
ttconsider seeing a therapist, as well.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttShe told you about. . .

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttHer dog, yes.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttActually, it was her husband's dog...

tGreenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the 
tfirst time, and GRADY
tstops.

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttLook, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all 
ttright? On top of that, you have a bite on your 
ttankle that is severely infected. We pumped you 
ttwith antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another 
ttday or two and you might have lost the foot. As 
ttfor your spells. I'm guessing they're a result 
ttof the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttThey're anxiety attacks? That's a little 
ttdisappointing.

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttBetter luck next time.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttSo is my friend...is Sara still here?

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttNo. There's no one here.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI have to see her. As soon as possible.

tGreenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in 
this eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.

<b>tttttGREENHUT
</b>ttLook, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave, 
ttI can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a 
ttprescription for a course of ampicillin and I 
ttwant you to follow it to the end-no matter how 
ttstupid you decide to be with everything else. 
ttAll right?

<b>122tINT. HOSPITAL/BRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON
</b>
tGRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around 
thim as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that 
tconnects one building to another.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI wonder if you could show me something. 

<b>123tEXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tGRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES 
ton display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple 
tand crazy with veins.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttAre these the only ones you have?

tThe nurse's eyes crinkle.

tttttGRADY (cont'd)
ttKidding... 

<b>124tEXT. GASKELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
tGRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER, then turns,     looks at 
tthe Gaskell house.

<b>125tEXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENT LATER
</b>
tGRADY KNOCKS. Nothing. Peers into the living room window.  
tDark.  He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse, 
tstanding ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting 
tonto its roof, melting.

<b>126tEXT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S
</b>
tGRADY hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the 
tglass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he 
tpulls away, but not before leaving...

t...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the 
tfrost of the glass.

<b>127tEXT. STREET  127
</b>
tThe snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the 
tstreet. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self 
ton the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and. 
t..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little 
tpistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol, 
tthen looks up into the sky.

tGRADY'S POV - of the SKY... 

t...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters 
tthe silence.

tNEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his 
thand.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(as if addressing God) 
ttIs that a suggestion?

tGRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO 
tSHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen 
tDS23 appears.  It passes.  Slows.  Stops. 

tGRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts 
thimself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara 
tmakes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but- 
tnot without humor. Then she rolls down the window.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI'm so glad to see you, Sara.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI believe you. Did that nice doctor let you 
ttout? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI'm through improvising. 

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttTerry told me about Wonder Boys. Is  it true? 
ttDid you lose it all?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI lost it ail.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttOh, Grady. You're such a putz.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI know.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttAnd you're old.

tSara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her 
tfingers. Yanks.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttOuch. How many?

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttDozens. It's very sad.

tSara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes 
twhen she looks into his, and-she glances away.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttI went and looked at-some babies just now.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttOh?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(trying to make her laugh)
ttI guess you have to go on faith.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttt(she doesn't)
ttSome times...

tGRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the 
tHOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttDid you tell Walter?

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI told Walter. 

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttDoes he still love you?

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttIt didn't come up. 

tGRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious 
tprofile, then turns her chin gently toward him.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttWell I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I 
ttdidn't know it at the time, but I'd always been 
ttwaiting for you. My whole life. Because you're 
ttwho I need. Because nothing makes sense without 
ttyou. Because the best moment of every day is 
ttthe moment I first see your face. And because 
ttwhen you leave a room, there's no reason to be 
ttin it any more. It's just a room again.

tSara cocks her head.

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttDid you just make that up?

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttt(shaking his head)
ttIn the hospital. I "was kind of excited about 
ttit at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy 
ttpainkillers.

tShe frowns good-naturedly. 

tttttGRADY (cont'd)
ttEven so...it's still true. Every word.

tSara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.

tttttGRADY (cont'd)
ttSara, I promise, even though commonsense might 
tttell you...

tSara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...

<b>tttttSARA 
</b>ttDon't write a page when a paragraph will do.

tGRADY nods, takes her hand. Looks at it as he speaks.

<b>tttttGRADY
</b>ttYou don't deserve me, you know.

<b>tttttSARA
</b>ttI know, but sometimes... 

tSara turns, looks at Grady. Her eyes are glistening. 

tttttSARA (cont'd) 
ttYou just go on faith.

tGRADY looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too, 
tdrifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other 
tside of the car and gets in. As GRADY snaps shut his door, 
tthe car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft 
tveil of falling snow. After a moment, GRADY and Sara are 
tlost too, nothing more than a blur.
