</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs
t(pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains
tof New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler
tturns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking
tarea.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler
tat LILLY DILLON, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold
tand watchful.
<b>t
</b>tWIDE SHOT, track in b.g. as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets
tout, locks the car. As she walks toward the track, WIPE
tRIGHT, as SCENE TWO WIPES IN from the left. SCENE ONE CAMERA
tFOLLOWS Lilly as she walks across the large parking area.
<b>tSPLIT SCREEN.
</b><b>t
</b><b>tSCENE TWO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tDowntown Los Angeles, near the courts and the business
tsection. ROY DILLON, 25, handsome and charming but self
tindulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out,
tpicks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around
tto open the trunk.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on the trunk, establishing the tools of the
tsalesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals
tand product sheets. Roy adds the ledger from the back seat,
tshuts the trunk, walks away.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. 6TH STREET - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tRoy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant. As he
tapproaches it, WIPE LEFT, the two half-width scenes
tcontracting to one-third each as SCENE THREE WIPES IN from
tthe right.
<b>t
</b>tSCENE ONE: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors.
<b>t
</b>tSCENE TWO: Roy approaches the bar.
<b>t
</b><b>tSCENE THREE:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tA baby blue Cadillac parks in front of a jeweler.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on the driver's door as MYRA LANGTRY, 36, beautiful
tin an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small
tjewelry care, and locks the car. At first glance, Myra looks
trather like Lilly. (Myra always wears large dangly earrings,
tand usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses.)
<b>t
</b><b>tSIMULTANEOUSLY:
</b><b>t
</b>tSCENE ONE: Lilly enters the track.
<b>t
</b>tSCENE TWO: Roy enters the bar.
<b>t
</b>tSCENE THREE: Myra enters the jeweler's.
<b>t
</b>tWIPE RIGHT AND LEFT, as SCENE TWO takes FULL SCREEN.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. BAR - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a
tNOISY lunchtime crowd. In b.g., Roy slithers his way to the
tbar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's
tattention.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on Roy as the bartender comes to him. Roy puts the
tbill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he
tSHOUTS his order. The bartender looks down.
<b>t
</b>tBARTENDER'S POV: Roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar
tbill.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE steep over Roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as
tthe bartender hurries away to get the drink. Roy's hand makes
ta fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto
tthe bar, holding it there with one finger.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on the bartender returning with a draft beer,
tnodding to other ORDERS shouted to him along the way, putting
tthe beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it,
thurrying away.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on Roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping Roy's change
tdown, moving on, Roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out.
<b>t
</b>tCU, the change, a ten dollar bill on top. Roy's hand closes
tover it.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tWIDE SHOT, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting
todds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet.
<b>t
</b>tCLOSE SHOT, number 3. Not much bet, odds 70-1.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on Lilly, frowning at the tote board. She carries a
tlarge heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as
tthough it were a file drawer.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track
tbeyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall.
tLilly moves.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly
tapproaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tA change of numbers sweeps across the board.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tLilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting
ttickets into her bag.
<b>t
</b>tECU, Lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small
tenvelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment. Lilly
tcarefully files the betting slips.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on Lilly looking out at the tote board.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tCU, number 3. Odds 32-1.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on Lilly, not satisfied. She turns and goes back.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE at the betting window as Lilly arrives and makes
tmore bets.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tCU, number 3. Odds 32-1. CROWD NOISE INCREASES. The numbers
tshift: odds 26-1.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    CALLER (O.S.)
</b>t          And they're off!
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tVery quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track. A slow
tticking clock.
tMyra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the
tJEWELER, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a
tjeweled bracelet through a loupe. He sighs, drops the loupe,
tshakes his head regretfully.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t          Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          Why? What's wrong?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t              (personal emotion mixed
t               in)
t          You are a valued customer, as you
t          know.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          But what's wrong?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t          I can't understand a thing like
t          this. It's something you almost
t          never see.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          What is?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t              (holding up bracelet)
t          This is some of the finest
t          filigreed platinum I've ever seen.
t          But the stones, no. They're not
t          diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          But they must be! They cut glass!
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t              (wry)
t          Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.
t          Do you know where it was purchased?
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tAn expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the
twindows. Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged
ton the bed and laughs at COLE "FARMER" LANGLEY, 55, stringy
tbodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips,
tpresenting himself to Myra. She reaches forward, hand hidden
tby his body as she lifts something that was hanging on
tsomething at the front of him. She brings back the bracelet,
tlooks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward
tagain toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          It was a gift. It isn't worth
t          anything at all?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t              (warm, encouraging)
t          Why, of course it is. I can offer
t          you -- well, five hundred dollars.
<b>t
</b>tMyra expected -- and needed -- a lot more. She's worried,
ttense, but stuck. She nods.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          All right.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t              (rising)
t          I'll get you a check.
<b>t
</b>tHe leaves the room. Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. SECOND BAR - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tAnother crowded lunchtime bar. A big beefy BARTENDER moves
tquickly, carrying a draft beer.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as
tthe bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the
tbill, stops, stares at the bill.
<b>t
</b>tTWO SHOT, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a
tvery cold look. He knows, and Roy knows he knows. Roy tries
tan innocent smile, which doesn't work. Roy moves.
<b>t
</b>tCU, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender
tsimultaneously grabs Roy's wrist.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away
tand the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching
tunder the bar with his right. He comes up with a sawed-off
tbaseball bat. Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to
tprotect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of
tthe bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard
tinto Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and
tpropelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. The
tnearest CUSTOMERS on both sides become aware that something
thappened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in
tconversations. The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the
tbat away under the bar.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in
tshock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already
tbeen closed in by other bodies. Nearly retching, he stumbles
ttoward the door.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race,
tswitching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away
tfrom the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly
tpasses by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves
ton along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tMyra sits as before. The jeweler enters with a check, which
the hands her. She looks up at him, making no move to leave.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t          I hope you're not too badly
t          disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          It's not your fault.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t          You'll give us an opportunity to
t          serve you again, I hope. If there's
t          anything you think we might be
t          interested in...
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          I have only one thing now. Are you
t          interested?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t          Well, I'd have to see it, of
t          course.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          You are seeing it. You're looking
t          right at it.
<b>t
</b>tThe jeweler is puzzled, then startled.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t          I see.
<b>t
</b>tHe turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at
tMyra.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    JEWELER
</b>t          You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A
t          bracelet like that very rarely
t          happens. A fine setting and
t          workmanship usually mean precious
t          stones. It always hurts me when I
t          find they're not. I always hope -- 
t              (faint sad friendly smile)
t          -- I'm mistaken.
<b>t
</b>tMyra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her
tproblem. She rises.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          Thank you. For everything you felt
t          you could do.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. STREET - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tRoy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled
tlike a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still
tclutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP
tgets out. He's suspicious at first.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    COP
</b>t          Sir? Everything all right?
<b>t
</b>tThe sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear. He
tstraightens, smiling through his pain.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Getting better. A bad shrimp, I
t          think.
<b>t
</b>tThe con's suspicion changes to concern.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    COP
</b>t          Want us to take you to a doctor?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          No no, I'm fine now, thanks,
t          anyway. Still got a lot of clients
t          to see.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    COP
</b>t          Take it easy, now.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Oh, I will.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tLate afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost
tall the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely
tseparated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to
tit from the track entrance.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her
tbag inside.
<b>t
</b>tCLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from
ther bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different
tcompartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these
tseparated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She
ttakes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag
twith the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she
tlifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor
tpanel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds
ttoday's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her
tshoulder, closes the trunk.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tA shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall
tbalcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front
tapartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the
tbasement garage.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tModest but clean. The owner, SIMMS, a sloppy garrulous old
tbore, talks with a potential RENTER.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    SIMMS
</b>t          Put it this way, now. Say I rent to
t          a woman, well, she has to have a
t          room with a bath. I insist on it,
t          because otherwise she's got the
t          hall bath tied up all the time,
t          washing her goddamn hair and her
t          clothes and everything she can
t          think of.
<b>t
</b>tIn b.g., Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves
tto Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue,
tand crosses to the mailboxes.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    SIMMS
</b>t          Now, your minimum for a room with
t          bath is three hundred a month, just
t          for a place to sleep and no cooking
t          allowed.
t          And just how many of these tootsies
t          make that kind of money and have to
t          eat in restaurants and buy clothes
t          and --
<b>t
</b>tRoy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain,
tcrosses to Simms.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Mr. Simms.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    SIMMS
</b>t              (fawning)
t          Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a
t          potential new neighbor, looking at--
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t              (uninterested)
t          Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
<b>t
</b>tSimms doesn't like Mrs. Langtry, but can't say so.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    SIMMS
</b>t          I'll send her right up.
<b>t
</b>tRoy goes back to the elevator. Simms continues his monologue.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    SIMMS
</b>t          I had my first hotel thirty-seven
t          years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas,
t          and that's where I began to learn
t          about women. They just don't make
t          the money, you see, not regular
t          they don't, and there's only one
t          way they can get it.
<b>t
</b>tRoy enters the elevator.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    SIMMS
</b>t          Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's
t          the fine type of person I have in
t          mind for here. Like yourself, I
t          have no doubt. He's a salesman,
t          regular as clockwork, has a suite
t          here. Fine man. Now, about these
t          women. At first, you know, they
t          just go out and do it now and then,
t          just enough to make ends meet. But
t          pretty soon they got that bank open
t          twenty-four hours a day, and then
t          you've got trouble. Hookers and
t          hotellin' just don't mix.
t          You'd think the cops'd be too busy
t          catching real criminals, not
t          snooping around after working
t          girls, but that's the way the gravy
t          stains, as the saying is, and I
t          don't fight it. An ounce of
t          prevention is my motto.
<b>t
</b>tMyra enters from the front, looks across at Simms, points
tupward. Simms calls to her.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    SIMMS
</b>t          Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up
t          there, he's expecting you.
<b>t
</b>tMyra crosses to the elevator. Simms speaks more softly.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    SIMMS
</b>t          If you keep out the women in the
t          first place, see, you keep out the
t          hookers, and then you keep out the
t          cops, and that's how you have a
t          clean place.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f.g.
tand Los Angeles in b.g. Myra crosses to the door, opens it
twith her key, enters.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tA small crowded old-fashioned bathroom. Roy, shirt open and
ttrousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the
tmirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach. He
ttouches his stomach, winces.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA (O.S.)
</b>t          Roy?
<b>t
</b>tHe looks at the door, then grins at his reflection.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Your medicine is here.
<b>t
</b>tHe leaves the bathroom.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tHotel furniture, shabby and anonymous. On the walls,
tcontrasting with everything else, are two crying-clown
tpictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames. Myra
tstands in the middle of the room, and Roy enters, shirt and
ttrousers still disarranged.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t              (amused by clothing)
t          Well, well. In a real hurry, are
t          we?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Always, for you, baby.
<b>t
</b>tHe reaches for her, but she playfully holds him off.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA
</b>t          You aren't taking me for granted,
t          are you?
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Taking you for granite?
<b>t
</b>tHe grins, as his fingertip prods her breast.
<b>t

tsmall bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of

<b>t
</b><b>tINT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tMyra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself
tcritically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tRoy lies supine on the bed, semi-conscious, half-covered by a
tsheet. Myra, casual, not noticing his condition, leans her
thead in through the doorway.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA

</b>t          Wait'll next year.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE across Roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond
thim. Through it, the living room and outer door can be seen.
tMyra crosses the living room, opens the door. Bright sunlight
tpours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face. She closes the
tdoor, and he gives up trying to smile. Gingerly, he touches
this bruised stomach, winces.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Damn that guy.
<b>t
</b>tHe's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain. He
tsits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches
tpainfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from
tit, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it
ton the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of
this right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and
trepeats. Then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips
tit, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, SPEAKS
tsimultaneously with the hands coming together.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Smack.

</b>t          Tails.
<b>t
</b>tHe's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him.
tHe sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem.
tHe forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds
tit on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of
tthe other hand, looks away.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Tails.

</b>tRight again. He prepares to flip the coin, but then his hand
tsags onto the covers, his chin drops, his eyes glaze.

t          How much can I bet?
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tThe train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light
tand-dark pattern. Roy, four or five years younger, sits with
ta three-core-monte gang, consisting of a DEALER, a spectacled
tSHILL beside him, Roy facing the dealer, a ROPER next to Roy.
tOn a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up:
tAn ace and two deuces. Across the aisle, alone in the seats,
tsits MINTZ, a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch,
tbut watching with amusement.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    DEALER
</b>t          That's between you two. I got
t          nothing at stake here, I'm just
t          dealing.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    SHILL
</b>t          What if we both guess wrong? You
t          aren't gonna take...
<b>t
</b>tThe dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted. He
tand the shill ARGUE nonsensically. The roper nudges Roy, then
treaches out and crimps the ace. Roy's doing a wide-eyed
tbumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking
ttoward Roy and the roper, then increasing the force of his
targument.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE across the amused Mintz at the roper whispering to
tRoy.
<b>t
</b>tTWO SHOT, Roy and the roper.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROPER

</b>t              (doubtful)
t          The ace is what I want?

</b>tThe roper's having trouble keeping his patience.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROPER
</b>t          Sure it is!
<b>t
</b>tTWO SHOT, the dealer and the shill, fake-squabbling, Roy and
tthe roper seen in b.g. between their faces, Roy finally
tbringing out his wallet, withdrawing a bill. Relieved, the
tdealer and the shill cut the crap.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE on the group as Roy puts his hundred dollar bill on
tthe briefcase.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Is that okay?
<b>t
</b>tThe shill pulls a messy wad of bills from his inner pocket,
tuses most of it to cover the bet.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    SHILL
</b>t          You're damn right that's okay.

tdark playing on his face.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Too dark. I just can't see.
<b>t
</b>tCasually, but too quickly to be stopped, he reaches across
tand plucks the shill's glasses off.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Let me borrow these, will you?
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE across Mintz, surprised and amused, at the group in
tb.g., in consternation as Roy puts on the glasses and looks
tdown at the cards.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY
</b>t          Now, that's better.
<b>t
</b>tROY'S POV: The glasses are 'readers.' Through them, a large
tgray 'A' can be seen on the back of one of the non-crimped
tcards. Roy's hand reaches out and flips it over. It's the ace
tof spades.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. BEDROOM - DAY

</b>tAN ANGLE across Roy toward the doorway. Roy, eyes closed,
tsmiles in triumph, then winces in pain. Mintz partially
tappears, hovering beside the bed, grinning at Roy.

</b>tWeary bored people sit around waiting. Roy, 17, lugging a big
tsuitcase, walks through, takes a seat near Mintz, who's doing
tcard tricks for his own pleasure. Roy watches, then moves
tcloser.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    ROY

</b>tMintz peers at him, taking an interest. Then he holds up the
tfive of spades, shows it to Roy, puts it back in the deck,
tshuffles, shows Roy the deck.
<b>t

tseveral lanes of heavy Los Angeles-bound traffic. LONG BEAT.
tHundreds of cars rush by. CAMERA PANS with Lilly's white
tChrysler as it comes along in the stream.
<b>t
</b>tAN ANGLE through the Chrysler's left side window at Lilly,
tdriving, concentrating, biting her left thumbnail. She
tbecomes aware that's what she's doing, shakes her head in
tirritation: She's trying to break herself of this habit.
tOstentatiously she tucks the thumb into her fist, rests the

tthrowing light on Roy, who doesn't react. Lilly enters, in

teating a bowl of chili and reading a newspaper folded beside

tsits with a male FRIEND at the counter, drinking coffee. The
tdrunk keeps looking toward Lilly, grinning, COMMENTING
tplayfully to his friend, who's bored by it all. Lilly doesn't
tseem to be aware of him.

</b>tThe drunk rises from his stool, turning toward Lilly,
tstaggering slightly. His friend makes a small move to stop

<b>t
</b>tThe drunk wants to sit beside Lilly, who looks to the
twaitress to solve the problem, but the waitress stands there
twith the coffee pot, looking helpless. The drunk bends to
tslide onto the seat. Lilly, exasperated, rabbit punches him
tin the throat.
<b>t
</b>tThe drunk, astounded and in pain (and not breathing),
tstaggers back, flailing, hitting the waitress's arm so that

</b><b>tEXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tThe setting is a wide porch or lanai pretending to be a 19th
tcentury locale; a mix of western and antebellum south; the
tusual tourist confusion of histories. The effect is both
tromantic and false. Roy and Myra linger over wine, near the
tend of their meal. Roy's relaxed, happy, expansive. Myra's
tpleased but watchful, the bird watching the worm.

</b><b>t
</b>tNew skyscrapers are separated by blank fields or small older

<b>t

</b>tMyra, dressed expensively and fashionably, sits with

</b>t          And now they're hurting. Everything
t          they had was because of oil.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tGlossy, but no people around. The limo stops, the mustached
tCHAUFFEUR hops out and holds the door as Myra and Hebbing
temerge and cross to enter the building, Myra carrying an
tattache case.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    MYRA (V.O.)

tto his liking.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. ATRIUM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tThis building has a central atrium with corridors circling
tit, waist-high walls on the atrium side, glass-walled

</b>tA clean anonymous Holiday Inn. Lilly, dressed for the track,
tsits at the round table under the swag light, sorting through

tlike a trapped animal. Then she's calm again. She turns the

twall.

tpicture and takes it off the wall. She finds it surprisingly
theavy. She carries it to the coffee table, puts it down there
ton its back, sits on the sofa.

tagainst the sides, looks to see if the front or sides open
tsomeway, and finally turns the picture over, laying it face

tleave the room.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tVery small, little used. Dark. Lilly switches on the light
twhen she enters, then leans against the counter, fists

tgrits her teeth, hyperventilates, stares around the room in
tsearch of escape, an answer, something.
<b>t
</b>tCU, Lilly's face, desperate, grim, but not giving up.
<b>t
</b>tWIDE SHOT. Lilly opens cabinets, finds two glasses, opens the
tnearly-empty refrigerator, gets ice cubes from a tray, puts
tthem in the glasses, puts the partial tray back in the
tfreezer compartment, fills the glasses from the cold water
ttap, puts the glasses on the counter, stares at them briefly.
tShe then shakes her head, searches the kitchen some more, and
tfinds a cookie sheet she can use as a tray. She puts the
tglasses on the tray, carries the tray from the room, leaving
tthe light on.

tglass.
<b>t

<b>t
</b>tLilly crosses back to the sofa, sits beside the attache case,

<b>t
</b>tLilly subsides back onto the sofa. One hand rests on the
tattache case. With the other, she sips water, puts the glass
tback down. Roy watches her, unmoving, expressionless. Lilly
tfrowns, not quite looking at him.
<b>t
</b><b>t                    LILLY

twilling it not to happen. He stops moving. His eyes dull.
tLilly clasps her arms around herself. She knows she doesn't
tdare scream. Lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she
tHISSES her agony through her teeth. She HISSES; she HISSES;
tshe HISSES. Then, slowly, she regains control.
<b>t
</b>tWIDE SHOT as Lilly gets to her feet. She seems dazed now,
tlike someone who's just been in a traffic accident. She
tblunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends to
tpick it up. She studies the clasp, sees it still works, goes
tback to her knees.
<b>t
</b>tLOW ANGLE, Lilly in f.g., Roy in b.g., as Lilly repacks the
tmoney into the case, wiping the blood from some wads onto the
tcarpet. Finishing, she closes the case, then remains on her
tknees, bending over the case. She WEEPS grindingly.
<b>t
</b>tWIDE SHOT, entrance door in b.g. Lilly's weeping subsides.
tShe gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. CAMERA
tHOLDS. SOUND of water running in sink. SOUND STOPS. Lilly
treappears. She does not again look toward Roy. She picks up
tthe attache case, crosses to the door, opens it, steps across
tthe threshold, reaches back to switch off the light. GO TO
<b>tBLACK.
