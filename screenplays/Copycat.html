<b>tINT. LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY
</b>
tThe hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is
tspeaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is
ta projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,
tFANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and
tTRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser
tpointing device.  We see her from a considerable
tdistance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and
tassured.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttOur society creates these socially
ttand psychically disenfranchised
ttmen, and their revenge on society
ttis terrible.  They are hard to
ttcatch.  They are "the nice guy next
ttdoor," their employers -- if they
ttwork at all -- find them quiet and
ttuncomplaining.  Early abuse and
ttrejection have taught them
ttpassivity.  Only in their violent
ttfantasies do they feel alive.  What
ttthey seek in their frenzied
ttassaults on their victims is relief
ttfrom passivity.  For these men, ten
ttminutes relief is worth far more
ttthan the life of another human
ttbeing.  Torture, the pain they
ttinflict, the screams of the victim,
ttare all part of the ritual that
ttgives them a brief respite from
tttheir own psychic pain.  And then
ttthe depression, the forgetting, the
ttfeeling of sadness and despair
ttbegins the cycle all over again.
ttLike addicts seeking their drug,
ttAlbert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
ttBerkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they
ttseek out their next victim.

tDuring the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera
thas moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the
tbalcony railing.

<b>tCLOSEUP: HELEN
</b>
<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttThe cycle is endless until they are
ttcaught.  And they are caught by
ttchance -- they run a red light, and
tta body is in the trunk.  A leakingt
ttpipe brings a plumber to a basement
ttwhere they is the smell of death.

tHer eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in
tthe balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.

<b>tHELEN'S POV:
</b>
tSitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED
tMAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed
tarms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.

tHELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:

tBackstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly
talert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of
texposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the
twings on the other side of the stage, also springs to
tattention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...

tTheir POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer
tthere.

tHELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttAt any time, right now, as you
ttlisten, the FBI estimates there are
tt30 to 35 serial killers stalking
tttheir victims.  The serial killer is
tta plaque that must be addressed not
ttonly by the law, but by science.
ttFlorida spent eight million dollars
ttto execute Ted Bundy.  It would
tthave been better spent building a
ttforensic penal facility devoted to
ttresearch.

tOnce again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself
tthat the smiling man is not there...

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttConfined for life, without parole,
ttand subjected to scientific study,
ttthese men's lives might finally, in
ttsome small measure, educate and
ttthereby protect society.  Thank
ttyou.

tApplause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They are
tcarefully casing the crowd.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tLATER:
</b>
tThe crowd is breaking up.  FIRST COP walks HELEN to the
tladies' room.  People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes 
tas well as she can with her fear.  THEY LEAVE THE STAGE
<b>tTHROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO
</b><b>tDRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...
</b>
<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY
</b>
tTHE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks
taround.  Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS.  He
thastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.
tBefore the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to
tstand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the
thigh heels to a stall several doors down.

<b>tCLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:
</b>
tAnd a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the
tankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear from
tview as

tHELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper
taround the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise
tmakes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is
tjust able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES
<b>tDOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.
</b>
tLike a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently
tyanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door.

tCORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears
tthe clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He
treacts...

<b>tINT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED
</b>
tThe RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a
thook inside his own stall.  KNOCKING (o.s.)

ttttCOP (o.s.)
ttDoctor Hudson?  Are you okay in
ttthere?

tThe MAN lets slip a little slack.

tHELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,
tget just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little
tscream.

tCORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous
tsounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for
ta split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now
tthere is more SOUND from inside...

<b>tINT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tCOP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S shoulder
twe see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at
ther throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the
ttoilet seat.

tCOP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back we
tsee a broom closet door opening.

tHELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a
tsecond, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he falls,
this gun still in his hand.

tRED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at
<b>tHELEN.
</b>
tCOP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractions
tin his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,
tthe sound reverberating against the tile walls.

<b>tSTAGE AREA
</b>
tThe audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.
tHELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.

<b>ttttttttSLAM CUT:
</b>
<b>tINT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT
</b>
tAs HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try
tdesperately to pull the dream rope from her neck.  She is now
tpale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her
teyes.  This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttAndy!  Andy!

tShe races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT
tFEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a
thall.  She looks in, gasping for breathing...

<b>tINT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tThe room is neat -- nobody there.  (We will later see that it
tis used on and off by her computer, Andy.)

tHELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone.  SHE TALKS TO
tHERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,
twhere she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)
tThe sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm
therself with the sound of her own voice...

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttIt is October twelfth, 1994 in the
ttcity of San Francisco, California,
ttU.S.A., the strongest, richest,
ttmost stable and happiest country in
ttthe world.  That is the sole place
ttof life in the universe.  Under
ttGod.

tCLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  Two pills are shaken out into a palm,
tothers scattering from the nervous haste...

tCLOSE: HELEN  Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she
ttosses down the pills, gulps water.  She regards her haggard
treflection with a certain detachment...

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttGood God.  What happened to you?

tShe barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will
therself from near-hysteria to relative calm...

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
tHALL  As she exits the bathroom.  And moves into her OFFICE.
tShe pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.
tOf the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank.  The
tother shows a chess setup.  Flashing on the bottom of the
tscreen comes a command.

<b>ttttCHESSMASTER
</b>tt'It's almost seven.  Make a goddam
ttmove.'

tShe studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a
tmove.  She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other
tcomputer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.

<b>ttttCHESSMASTER
</b>tt'Lousy move.  Not really into this
ttgame, Helen.  Let's drop it.  I've
ttgot a feeling about you.  Let's
ttmeet.  Like a date.'

tHELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>tt'I'm a terrible date.  I'd mess up your
ttlife.'

<b>ttttCHESSMASTER
</b>tt'Another romantic dream gone all to
tthell.'

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>tt'Maybe it's better to just dream
tton; avoid the disappointments of
ttlife.  Come on, move.'

tShe pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window
tcurtains open.  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN!  We see that the
tT-shirt HELEN wears says "Shrinks 'R' Us."  She crosses to
tthe window with her glass of cognac, looks out.

<b>tVIEW:
</b>
tA sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County.  The
tmorning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.
tHELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to <u>feel</u> the
tair, the freedom.  Feeling quite restored from the dream
thorror of the night...

<b>tO.S., THE PHONE RINGS.  HELEN.  A FRISSON.
</b>
tCLOSE: PHONE  Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the
thandset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(carefully)
ttYes?
ttt(listens)
ttYou son-of-a-bitch!  Son of
tta bitch...

tStiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttYou <u>filthy</u>... <u>son of a bitch</u>!

tOn the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his
tmove: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice:

<b>ttttCOMPUTER
</b>ttt(filter)
ttYou Queen is in check.
ttProtect your Queen.

<b>tOVER CREDITS:
</b>
tHOME MOVIE of a young woman dressed in a seat suit.  It is
tmorning, and she is jogging on a park path.  Her hair is in
ta long braid.  She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly
tnear the end of a satisfactory run.

<b>tTHE FILM REVERSES, THE FILM STARTS UP AGAIN IN EXTREMELY

<b>tINT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY
</b>
<b>tMUZZLE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL BLASTS NINE SHOTS ALMOST
</b><b>tDIRECTLY INTO CAMERA.  A BEAT OF SILENCE...
</b>
tTHE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso;
tcentered in the right side of the upper chest, near the
tshoulder, is a small red circle.  Still SMOKING, THE HOLES
tFROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none
tin the circle.

<b>ttttM.J. (V.O.)
</b>ttMy third grade teacher at the
ttconvent shot better than that.

<b>tTHE SHOOTER, RUBEN GOETZ, AND PARTNER M.J.
</b>
<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttYeah, but she had divine guidance.

tWe now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J.
tHALLORAN.  M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking
tyoung woman.  She is neat, buttoned down, crisp.  M.J.
tappears to be about twenty-five.  She is, in fact,
tthirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of
tsergeant.  She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose
tsweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear
teven smaller and younger than she is.

tRUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior
tin authority to M.J.  RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored
tand laid back.  He has a cellular phone attached to his
tbelt.

<b>tM.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM,
</b><b>tAND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.
</b>
<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttI'd feel a whole <u>lot</u> safer with
ttSister Loretta for my backup.  Look
ttat this guy: you shredded him!

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttWell, he's dead, he can't hurt me
ttnow.

tThe target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back 
tto shooting position.

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttIt's sloppy shooting.  It's in
ttcharacter, Ruben, but unnecessary.
ttAnd bad for your career.

tRUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the
tcircle.  M.J. looks at him in surprise.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttI've been practicing.  Now can I
ttkiss your tummy?

tM.J. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttPerp's holding a hostage, the
ttshoulder on his gun hand is gonna
ttbe exposed.

tSOUND: A CELLULAR PHONE (ON RUBENS' BELT).  M.J. holds her
tfire.

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttAnswer it.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttI'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't
ttyou at least interested in which

tShe's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he
tanswers, she raises her gun and aims...

tHe hits the "end" button...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttYou hit the brachial nerve...

tSHE FIRES!  The shots make a perfect heart around the circle,
tinside his looser pattern.  ONE FINAL SHOT STRIKES EXACTLY
<b>tIN THE MIDDLE!
</b>
<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttYou're good enough you'll never
tthave to kill anyone.  I joined the
ttcops to save lives, not waste them.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttYou know, M.J., when I watch you
ttshoot, I realize I've got a little
ttproblem with my stance... could you
ttjust move over here and critique my
ttlegs?

tHe slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be.
tShe is unloading her weapon...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttThe problem is between your legs.
ttYou told your shrink about that?

tShe is unloading and cleaning up.  Ruben doing the same...

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttI tell my shrink about <u>you</u>,
ttSergeant.  I tell him you're the
tttop cop of my dreams.

tRuben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which
the has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks
tone up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY
</b>
tThey pull up in front of an apartment building in the
tPacific Heights section.  Patrol cars flank the street, the
tthick yellow ticker tape "POLICE CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS"
tis already up.  M.J. double parks beside a blue-and-white.
tA couple of cars from the media are already there.  SUSAN
tSCHIFFER a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay
tM.J. and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttOh, Christ, the Mouth is already
tthere.

tShe is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak
tof a life of orthodontics and dreams of TV anchorship.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttHey.  And there's the Haircut right
ttbehind.  If she stops short he's

ttInspector, can you...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttI just got here myself, Susan.

<b>ttttSUSAN
</b>tt...confirm this third murder adds
ttup to a pattern?  Do we have a
ttserial killer on the loose in the
ttcity?

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttI just got here.  Talk to you

ttt barrier tape)
ttWhat the hell does she want to do,
ttscare everybody to death?

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttThat's her job... Jesus, Quinn is
tthere already.

tQUINN, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide
tstands at the top of the steps leading to the front door.
tAs they climb up toward him...

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttI been waiting... I have to do
tteverything myself.  Photo, crime
tttech, the Coroner are already
ttinside.  The Landlady calls it in;
tttenant is not answering when
ttcalled, she sticks her head in,
ttsees the body, uses the deceased's
tttelephone to call 911.  Otherwise
ttnothing disturbed.  It's all yours,
ttkid.  I'll take care of the Mouth
ttand the Haircut.

tM.J. and Ruben enter...

<b>tINT. APARTMENT HOUSE - HALL - DAY
</b>
tFour uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises;
tat the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman
tchain-smoking (the Landlady).

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttt(to cop)
ttThat the Landlady?
ttt(to Ruben)
ttYou wanna talk to her, Ruben?
ttt(back to cops)
ttWho was first on the scene?

tMike answers her question by answering to Ruben!

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttI was.

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttt(forcefully)
ttI'm over here?  What's your name,
ttOfficer?

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttMichael Johnson.

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttYou touch anything, Mike?  Pick up
ttanything?  Use the doorknob?  I
ttdon't want to find your prints on
ttanything later and you tell me you
ttforgot to tell me.

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttNo.  I didn't.

tShe glances at him, at the SLIGHTLY OLD INFLECTION ON THE "I
tDIDN'T."  But moves on, as Ruben goes to the Landlady...

<b>tINT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe same YOUNG WOMAN we saw jogging, is now dead.  Hair
tstill in a long braid.  She wears only a blouse, open and
tpushed back.  She is on her back in the bathtub, with one
tleg dangling over the side of the tub.  The effect is
tslightly posed, but casual, relaxed.

tBending over her is DOC, the Coroner, WITHDRAWING A HUGE
<b>tMEAT THERMOMETER FROM HER SIDE.
</b>
tM.J. APPEARS IN THE BACK OF THE SHOT taking in the scene.
tForeground, Doc reads the thermometer.  The photographer is
tfinishing up his shots.  The room is crowded.  Two Coroner's
tmen wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between
tthem; M.J. has to pass between them to come down to the
tbody.  THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON M.J.'S FACE; HER REACTION TO
<b>tTHE SCENE, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON THE SCENE ITSELF.  
</b><b>t

<b>tTHE TELEPHONE RINGS.
</b>
<b>ttttCOP (V.O.)
</b>ttTell whoever she can't come to the

tNobody laughs...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttThat's real old material, get a new

tShe picks up the phone after the second ring, holding
tit in tissue someone hands her...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttHello?

</b>ttt(extremely cheerful)
ttHello!  This is Geena Martinez, how
ttare you this morning?

</b>ttWhat is this about, Ms Martinez?

<b>ttttPHONE VOICE
</b>ttI'm conducting a telephone survey
ttto determine whether you're

tM.J. gently hangs up the phone.  She has been looking at the
tDead Woman... They pick up where they left off.

<b>ttttDOC
</b>ttHe used something soft, like a
ttstocking or a bathrobe tie.

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttAnybody find it?

tNo answer as the Coroner's men crowd in beside M.J. to begin
tlifting the body out of the tub.  M.J. takes one last look
tinto the dead woman's eyes...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttCover her up, please.

</b>
tRuben still talking to the Landlady and taking notes.  M.J.
tapproaches Mike... takes him aside...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttMike.  Why don't you tell me what's
ttbothering you?

tMike is acutely uncomfortable.

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttWhatever it is, I'm gonna find out
ttand sooner is a hell of lot better
ttthan later.

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttWell, there's something missing in

tShe seems relieved.  Brightly:

</b>ttWell, it's all right, then, Mike.
ttThanks.

<b>tEXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

tIn the door, M.J. appears, looking out thoughtfully over the

tof despair.

</b>
tThe newspaper lies there, out of reach.

tThe newspaper melts like a Dali watch.

tHELEN sweats.  She lies flat on her stomach and crawls toward

tsquirms back inside.

</b>ttWell!  Aren't we the daring one?
ttWhat's morbid and ghastly enough in

tIn a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his

</b>ttListen, asshole, I've got a gun...

tRUBEN grabs ANDY by the collar and yanks his head inside the

</b>ttI hate this...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttI just came from her... here's what
ttyou haven't seen.

tM.J. takes out a picture of the dead RED-HEADED WOMAN.  Her
tmanner is that of cop with a witness.

ttttM.J. (cont'd)
ttA forgery of the Mary Sullivan
ttmurder scene, he's done it perfect.
ttExcept for the sign.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(looking at photo)
ttShe probably let him in the door
ttwithout a thought.  Where are their

ttthat are supposed to teach them to

ttto fight?

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttLook at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the
ttFestival of Love?  You make any

tHELEN stares at the picture.

ttttM.J. (cont'd)
ttFor 'Hell', read 'Helen'.  He's
tttalking to you.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttIt's <u>anybody</u> connected to author-

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttNobody knows you have anything to

tton TV or the news... Why would he
ttwant to get in <u>your</u> computer?

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttBecause I'm his damned pin-up girl!
ttHis, all of them!  They know me.

</b>ttThe moon is up, my night to howl.
ttWill you be okay?

</b>ttOh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You

</b>ttI know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttMaryJane.  We call her M.J.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttMaryJane.  You think that logic and

ttand method will hold back the
tthorrors of a world gone mad and the
ttsickness of the night.  I did once.
ttBut you know how he'll get caught?
ttHe'll have an accident, or some cop
ttwill get lucky.  You can't catch
tthim by being intelligent and
ttworking hard.  Or the worst:  there
ttare dozens of women slaughtered in
ttthe most horrible way, month after
ttmonth.  The news stories grow more
ttgrotesque and bizarre and in the
ttcity people lock their doors and
ttwindows, and hurry home before
ttdark.  And then, one day, there are
ttno more.  What happened?  Did he
ttjust stop?  Get tired and disgusted
ttand decide not to kill any more?
ttDid he kill himself?  Did he die in
ttan auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or
ttget sick and die?  It's like the
ttmurderer walked off the edge of the
ttearth.  And you never know.  But
ttyou keep asking yourself -- when you
ttread about a new murder -- is he
ttback?

tM.J. stands.  She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's
tstory.  There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice...

</b>ttHe's going home.  He slept over

</b>
<b>tEXT. HELEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
tTHE SILENT WATCHER'S POV through the eye of the
tCAMCORDER, we catch M.J. exit HELEN'S building.  She stops
tmomentarily on the sidewalk to look up at Helen's window...
tThe drapes swing open.  RUBEN CAN BE SEEN DOING SOMETHING AT
tTHE WINDOWS... The Camcorder zooms to a close-up of M.J.
tShe gets into her car and speeds off.

<b>tINT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tRuben is checking the windows...

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttYou ought to get some decent locks
tton these.  A six-year-old could get
ttin here.  Much less a motivated
ttman.

tAt the phrase 'motivated man', HELEN looks at him boldly in the
teye.
<b>  ttttHELEN
</b>ttYou and MaryJane aren't lovers.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttNot yet.

tHELEN laughs.  So does RUBEN.  Her boldness, her <u>laughter</u>,
tattracts him.  His honesty attracts HELEN.  He feels the
theat.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttAre you always so bold?

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttNo.  I'm shy and I'm selective.

tHis grin says he'd select her anytime...

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttThe problem for me is... you're in
ttthe witness category.
ttt(beat -- Jack

ttKnow what I mean?

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttWell.  Another time, then.
ttt(beat)
ttI'll be all right.  He's not going
ttto attack me; what I' m rally
ttafraid of is all in my own head,
ttRuben.

tThey smile ruefully at one another, and without further
tconversation, leave the bedroom.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. HELEN'S FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
tRUBEN is outside the door.  HELEN just inside.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttThey'll have a guard here tomorrow.
ttI know you have the idea, but it'll
ttmake me feel a lot better.

tShe smiles, and RUBEN turns, walks away.  She stays in the
tdoorway watching his retreat.  About ten feet away, he
tsuddenly stops.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttHey!

tHe turns around, she is still in the doorway.  He reaches
tfor his wallet, withdraws a card, holds it up to her.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttThe number for my cellular.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttDon't hesitate.  <u>Anytime</u>.  Night or
ttday.  I mean that.

tHe hods card out to her.  HELEN, holding onto the door
tframe, doesn't move.  RUBEN continues to extend his hand
twith the card in it.  It is a charged moment.  She is frozen
tin the doorway; RUBEN refuses to make a move towards her.
tHELEN summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame,
tdetermined not to have any further mortification this night,
tshe takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him.
tThen a second step and a third.

tHer hand touches the card, takes it.

tShe turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat.
tWhat she sees is that the door's Sureclose device has
tquietly and efficiently closed.  The door is locked.
tFrantic, she turns back toward RUBEN.

<b>tHER POV:
</b>
tRUBEN, now seems a vast distance away from her.  He is just
tturning down the stairs and is gone... The hallway first
tnarrows, squeezing her in, then expands.  She is lost in the
tmiles and miles of space between the two walls.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttOh, God!  Help me!

tRUBEN reappears, races toward her...

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttTell me what to do!

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI'm falling!  I'm going to fall!

tShe starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but RUBEN
tcatches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like
ta suspect.  He puts one hand on the back of her neck,
tspreads her legs, gets her in frisk position.  Somehow, this
tis comforting to her, but she is still in full-blown
tpanic...

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>tt...falling... FALLING!

tHe pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring
ther against the feeling of free-fall.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttI'm right here.  I won't let you
ttfall.

tHe still has a hand on the back of her neck.  Suddenly, the
tproximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck.  She
tbegins to hyperventilate.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttDon't let go... I can't breathe...
ttI'll die!

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttShhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe.
ttI'll fix it...

tRUBEN takes out his gun...

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttPut your hands over your ears.

tRUBEN shoots off the lock.  Then he picks HELEN up and
tcarries her back into her apartment.

<b>tINT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tRUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw
tup over her.  He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it
tto her.  She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer
twater, then watches her take the pills.  After which he
ttakes the bottle and pockets it.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttThe lock...

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttI'll get a locksmith.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttWill you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid
ttto sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in
ttmy head...

tRUBEN pulls a big chair up beside the sofa.  As her eyes
tclose, RUBEN comforts her.  TV features the antics of a
tnervous little prairie dog family.  He looks back at HELEN.

<b>tCLOSE UP HELEN:
</b>
tWe hear a faint but impatient voice call:

<b>ttttV.O.
</b>ttPeter... Peter...

<b>tttttttCROSS FADE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT
</b>
tDim light.  The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not
tcomfortably.  A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.
tShe is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks
tolder.  A chronic invalid.  By her side is a NASTY LITTLE
tDOG, with ribbon bows in its fur.  Near the bed is a TV and
tvideo, on which a movie's final credits are running.

<b>tTHE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON
</b>
tPETER enters.  Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.
tBoyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near
this hairline.  AN OLD SCAR.  He goes straight to TV and puts
tthe tape on 'eject.'

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttPut in the Kevin Costner.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttWhy don't we save it for later?
ttIt's almost time for Letterman.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttYou know I don't like to watch talk
ttshows by myself.  Where're you?

tHe inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.'  Then he
tapproaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a
tlock of hair back from the forehead.

tShe ignores him, staring at the screen.  The NASTY LITTLE
<b>tDOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.
</b>
<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttSee, now you've annoyed her.  You
ttknow she doesn't like you to touch
ttme.
ttt(to dog)
ttDoes she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve
ttyou so much!
ttt(to Peter)
ttDid you feed her?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttYes, I fed her.  If she says she's
tthungry, she's lying to you.  Again.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttShe doesn't lie!  You sure you fed
tther?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttShe lies all the time.  Why would I
ttsay I fed her if I didn't?

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttThat's what I don't know.  Why
ttwould you lie?  That's the
ttproblem... I can't understand why
ttanyone would lie.

tHe leaves.  As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking
tto her dog over the TV soundtrack.

ttttWOMAN (cont'd)
ttYou wouldn't lie to Mummy, would
ttyou?  Just to get Dad in trouble?
ttSuch a naughty widdle dog...

tHER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a
tsmall, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen,
tthen through a door leading to the basement.  He locks the
tbasement door behind him.

tTHE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets
tand computers.  As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a
tsmall TV/video set attached to a wall.  On its screen,
tfreeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an
toutdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.

tPETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over
tsomething to turn the video back on.

tThe CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across.  It is
tthe YOUNG GIRL from the concert.  She is strapped onto a
ttable, her mouth taped shut.  A plastic bag covers her head,
tbut not tightly.  She is semiconscious.  She is being
tasphyxiated by slow degrees.

tPETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to
trepeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made
ttoward his wife.  He whispers:

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttDidn't I promise I'd come right
ttback?

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

tALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of
tglorious misty green hills, hand in hand.  The Camera moves
tdown, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom
tof the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway.  A
tfew festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new
tCRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a
tnumber of unmarked cars.

<b>tRUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.
</b>
tAs he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH
tTHE SCENE TO FIND M.J.  M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S
tstubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns
taway.  Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttUp all night with a sick friend.

tNIKKO'S face is tight with anger.

<b>ttttNIKKO
</b>ttYou dumb son of a bitch!  You don't
tteven know how to treat a woman.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttWho?  M.J.?  Hey, Nikko, explain to
ttme why she gave you the boot...

tHe moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE
tWOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE.  The plastic bag is
tnow tied tight around her neck.  She has been posed beneath
ta sign that says "NO DUMPING".  The usual technicians,
tphotographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttIs Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttt(angry about it)
ttQuinn decided we should form a task

ttShe wasn't killed here.

<b>ttttDOC
</b>ttNot likely.

tM.J. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels
tbeside her... to Ruben...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttTell me what you see.

tHe inspects the dead girl's fingernails.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttShe didn't fight back, no hair or

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttWhat about her arms?

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttNeedle marks, fresh, here.  look at

tNikko appears, looming over her...

<b>ttttNIKKO
</b>ttProbably so stoned she never knew
ttwhat got her.  Like Goetz's sick

tThey ignore him.  M.J. stands...

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttShe's blue as hell.  No marks on her

ttno ligature marks.  Outdoors...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttLook at her legs.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttSpread out like she was sexually
ttassaulted here.

<b>ttttDOC
</b>ttAfter she was dead.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttShe was dragged up here from the

ttwas already dead or unconscious.
ttLet's get plaster casts on any --

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttIf this is just the dump site,
ttwhere did he do the job?  Where did

<b>ttttNIKKO
</b>ttDoped up kids all over town.  Park
ttwas full of them last night.  Very
tteasy pickin'.  Goetz's type.

tRuben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes
tRuben.  Everybody stops in astonishment.  M.J. steps between
tthem.  Ready to get physical herself; they settle...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttWhat the hell are you doing?  The

tNikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut.  M.J. gestures for
tRUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow
ther back to the cars.  As they move more slowly down the
thillside to their cars...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttRuben, my God, I ought to put you

tthis point -- or not?

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttHey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on

tShe is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other
tside.  Susan races for her silver Audi...

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttRuben, put the light on...

tFrom outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm
tclap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.

tM.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES.  SUSAN has a faster
tcar, but M.J. is a better driver.  Stomach dropping hills,
ttrolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the
tfamiliar San Francisco chase scenes.

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttNow listen up, Ruben.  You never,

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttExcuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do

</b>ttThe woman's unstable.  You could

tt<u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny
ttlittle teenager.

tM.J. takes another two-wheel corner.  In the rear view
tmirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she
ttries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.

<b>ttttM.J.
</b>ttAnybody who's ever watched TV knows

tHaving lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttAh, if you knew that, you'd be half

tShe starts to laugh.  The sound is awful.  After a moment,
tshe gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door.  RUBEN takes
ther to the sink, sort of sits her down on it.  Wets a
twashcloth, goes to sponge off her face.  She is trembling.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttHe was in my apartment!

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttI know, baby.  I know.

tWithout warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak-out,

tthe hallway, RUBEN follows, tries to put his arms around
ther.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttIt's okay... you're safe with me!

tHe pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight
taround her, holding her still.  He smoothes her hair, rubs
ther neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.

<b>ttttRUBEN
</b>ttWhen I was a little kid, and I'd be

ttwould go out of me...

tShe breaks free and whacks him across his nose.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttYou think you're my Daddy?

tThere is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that
tRUBEN kisses her.  She goes limp, kisses him back, then
tshe's suddenly sobbing.  His nose is bleeding, but she's
tsmiling.  Something between them has finally connected.
tBeen agreed upon.

tHe digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it.

tAs the parade of FBI, led by their Commander SAKS, walk down

ta smart right angle turn, and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW)
tcontinue away from CAMERA down another corridor.  Through
tthe glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who
tpretend they aren't looking at them: no eye contact between
tcops and FBI.  The cops are at ease; bellies slop over
tbelts; neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts; sweat
tstains; shirtsleeves.  The marching men wouldn't sweat.

tQUINN emerges from his office and sees them arriving.  He
tgets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door, signals
ta few top officers to follow.  He looks resigned...

ttDr. Hudson:  Don't lose your head.
tt"Once that you've decided on a killing
ttFirst you make a stone of your heart
ttAnd if you find that your hands are still willing
ttYou can turn murder into an art.
ttWell, if you have a taste for this experience
ttYou're flushed with your very first success
ttThen you must try a twosome or a threesome
ttBefore your conscience bothers you much less.

ttTo lead us on -- to where and what

tt-- he's imitating each killer's

tand cuffs him.  KID starts to rattle his chairs, spew
tChinese epithets, then bends over the desk and, with his
tteeth picks up some paper, tries to shake it to shreds.

tRUBEN yanks the papers out of the KID'S mouth, pulls the
tKID'S chair from the side to the front of the desk, shoves
tthe KID into place facing away from the desk, so that he
tcan't do any more damage.  Then RUBEN can't figure out where

<b>tSTREET: HER OLD SAAB IS PARKED.  THE ANTENNA IS GONE, AND

tNEW ANGLE: Helen's Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed
tstreet into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and
tbrakes behind M.J.'s car.

tShe gets out of the car.  As she walks even her sneakers
tmake an echo from the silent stone facade... She walks up
tthe wide stairs...

tThe huge doors creak open and Helen enters.  She stands,

twithout the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily
treturns...

tHelen wills herself to move into the deep space before her.
tShe stands listening: we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a
tbuilding cooling in the night air.  Or is the movement of
tPeter somewhere in the room?

tShe whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the
tauditorium...

</b>
<b>tAS THE DOOR OPENS.  THE LIGHTS ARE ON: IT IS BRILLIANT,

</b>ttYou cheated!  You said you'd come

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttYou want one?  No?  There was
ttsomething in you that was
ttfascinated, that wanted to see what
tit was like for a man to die.
ttEverybody feels it.  Like every

ttThat's true.  I see it in you...

tfacing him... He looks into her face and smiles...

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttWe'll keep talking.  Until they get
tthere.  Then...
ttt(smiles)

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI have no life anymore.  I ruined
ttyour life, make me pay for it.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttWhy did you do that?  Didn't you
tthave any idea how hard it was for

ttyou.  You inspired me.  I thought
ttyou could understand me the way you
ttunderstood the others.  I knew that
ttabout you -- the ones you admired
ttwere the great murderers; they
ttfascinated you.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttThat's not who I admire -- I admire
ttpeople who are good at what they

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttI don't have the talent for any of

</b>ttOh, please.  I know what's coming,

</b>ttDo anything you want to me.  I give

ttfor people like me.

tHe leans toward her with the knife.  This might be the
tmoment.  His gun lies on the floor beside him.

<b>tHER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM; HE SEES IT

tThe medic turns to his medicine bag.  Cops swarm around

ttOh, God.

<b>tINT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

tIn the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big
