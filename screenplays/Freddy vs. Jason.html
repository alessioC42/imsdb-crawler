<b>ttNIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON
</b>
ttttby Lewis Abernathy


<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. ELM STREET - DAY
</b>
tMEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion.
tHer dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze.
tThe SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases.

<b>ttttDREAM CHILDREN
</b>ttt(in chorus)
ttOne... two... Freddy's coming for
ttyou.

tOn "you" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
tlightning only evil.  (Choice flashes from Nightmare on
tElm Street 1 & 2).

tMeagan turns at 1665.  A beautiful white, two-story
thouse, thick with lush green foliage.  Several beautiful
tchildren, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch
tand jumprope on the front walk.

<b>ttttDREAM CHILDREN
</b>ttt(continuing; chanting)
ttThree... four... better lock your
ttdoor.

tClose on a little girl's foot coming down on the number
t"4" drawn on concrete.

tAnother RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.  (Flashes
tfrom Nightmare 3 & 4).

tMeagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a
tlittle harder now.  The trees are brown, the leaves
tpeeling away.

tMoving up the walk, closer to the house... only now
tit's a little darker, needs some paint.  On the front
tporch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle.

<b>ttttDREAM CHILDREN
</b>ttt(continuing; chanting)
ttFive... six...

tRUMBLE.  Flash.  (Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead).

<b>ttttDREAM CHILDREN
</b>ttt(continuing; chanting)
tt...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix..

tThe "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka"
twe all recognize as Jason's theme.  Meagan turns to
tfind that the children in the yard have vanished. It's
tnighttime.

tThe trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon
tstretches off into utter nothingness.  Meagan turns
tback to the little girl.

tBut the little girl has gone.  Only the tricycle
tremains.  It circles once, the front door CREAKS open,
tand the empty tricycle peddles inside.  Meagan follows
tit into the...


<b>tINT. HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tMeagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri-
tcycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
tThen the front door blows shut behind Meagan.  She
ttries to open it -- locked.

tThen faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.  She listens,
ttrying to make out the low murmur.  Then a little girl's
tGIGGLE.  Meagan recognizes it as her sister's.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttLizzy?

tMeagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall...
tfollowing the voices (we recognize the other voice as
tbelonging to Freddy).  Meagan enters a door at the
tend of the hallway, moving into...


<b>tINT. LIZZY'S ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION
</b>
tOn the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year
told sister -- LIZZY.  Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and
tdraws with crayons.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttLizzy. What are you doing here?

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttPlaying with my friend.

tMeagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
tof Freddy.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttYour friend?

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttHe lives under the bed.

tMeagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
tLizzy's bed.

tSuddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
tthe bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out
tthe door.  Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
ttiny slash marks on her cheek.  Lizzy clucks.

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou scared him...

tMeagan looks out the door, incredulous.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttI scared him?

tBut when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLizzy?

tLizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
tin the...


<b>tINT. NIGHTMARE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tThe tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into
ta casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut.  Meagan
tgoes to the casket and carefully opens the lid.  Inside
t-- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling
tall over it.  Meagan screams and slams the lid back
tdown.

tThe casket starts to move -- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
tThen it stops.  Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again.

tInside -- FREDDY KRUEGER.  He grabs her arm.

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttWhere ya been all my death, baby?

tMeagan screams.  Freddy leaps out of the casket in a
ttuxedo, crooning:

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI've been waitin' at the altar for
tta long, long time!

tMeagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress,
tspattered with blood.  Behind her, the chapel has
tfilled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
tof decay.  A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
tasks:

<b>ttttSATANIC PRIEST
</b>ttAre the bridesmaids in attendance?

tMeagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets,
tdressed in body bags.

<b>ttttSATANIC PRIEST
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAnd the groomsmen...?

tFreddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
ttrapped souls struggling to get out of his chest.

<b>ttttSATANIC PRIEST
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIf anyone here believes that these
tttwo should not be joined in unholy
ttmatrimony, let him speak now or
ttforever rot in hell...

t>From the back of the chapel, a voice:

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttMeagan!

tMeagan turns.  It's her boyfriend -- JESSE.  He stands
tin the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms
toutstretched.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttJesse!

tMeagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms
tencircling one another.  She looks up into Jesse's
teyes... only it isn't Jesse.

tIt's Jason.

tMeagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing
tit down between her eyes...

<b>ttttttTRANSITION CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>
tMeagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES... she
twas dreaming.  She gets up quickly and crosses to her
tdresser.  She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts
ton her cheek, and clucks.  Then she exits, going into...


<b>tINT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tMeagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing
ta sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
twith a doll.  Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
tshe notices something not quite right about the doll.
tShe moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal
ta hideous little Freddy doll.  Meagan gasps.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttFreddy...

tSuddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers:

<b>ttttFREDDY DOLL
</b>ttWell it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!

tThe Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives,
tthrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.

<b>tttttHARD CUT TO:
</b>
tINT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING (for real)

tMeagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
tShe looks down and sees that there is nothing there.
tMeagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad
tdream.

tZZZZZZT! -- her alarm clock BUZZES.  Meagan sits up
twith a start again.  Her fright turns to rage as she
tpounds the alarm clock into submission.  Meagan climbs
tout of bed...


<b>tINT. LIZZY'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>
tMeagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching
ther Raggedy Ann doll.  She gently pries the doll away,
ttossing it disdainfully away.  Meagan picks up a small
tglass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's
thead.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttWake up, sleepy head. Time to wake
ttup.

tLizzy's eyes flutter open.  She smiles at her sister,
tthen frowns.

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttI had a bad dream.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttMe, too.

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttI was scared.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttDon't worry... they can't hurt you.

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttPromise?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttPromise.

tLizzy hugs Meagan.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI'll never let anyone hurt you.


<b>tINT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
tCLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table.
tA flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS
<b>tSPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A
</b>tNEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In
tthe background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN
tsurround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's
thouse.

<b>ttttNEWS REPORTER
</b>ttt(filtered)
ttAs the sun rises on yet another
ttmorning, still no end in sight for
ttthe standoff between police and the
ttmysterious group known only as the
tt"Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned
tthouse behind me just thirteen days
ttago.  These cultists -- mostly run-
ttaway teenagers -- have managed to
ttkeep police at bay for almost two
ttweeks while inside they take mind-
ttaltering narcotics in order to
ttcommunicate with their god --
ttFreddy.

tThe reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen
twhere MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping
tdown orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD,
twho is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours
therself a cup and sits.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttMorning.

tMeagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad
tlooks over his paper long enough to smile and say,
tjust a little too cheerfully:

<b>ttttMEAGAN'S DAD
</b>ttMorning, Meagan.

tMeagan looks over at her mother, then back at her
tfather, mouthing the words "How's mom?", when suddenly
tMeagan's mom bellows:

<b>ttttMEAGAN'S MOM
</b>ttt(calls upstairs)
ttLizzy! Get down here! Breakfast
ttis almost ready!

tMeagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back
tinto his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee.

tANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER.

<b>ttttNEWS REPORTER
</b>ttAlleged child murderer Fred Krueger
ttwas released on a legal technicality
ttbut later burned to death at the
tthands of a vigilante mob of grieving
ttparents.  Some years later, a rash
ttof bizarre and unexplainable teen-
ttage deaths began leaving many in
ttthe area to wonder... is Freddy
ttreally dead?

tMeagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to
tbreakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom
tpulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her
tfamily like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop
tTart, whining.

<b>ttttMEAGAN'S MOM
</b>ttHurry up and eat. You don't want
ttto be late for special school.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttMom! Don't call it that!

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttI hate that school. The other kids
ttare mean... and they're all re-
tttard-ed!

tMeagan snickers.

<b>ttttMEAGAN'S MOM
</b>ttWe don't use that word. They're
tt"special" children just like you're
tt"special".

tDad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look.
tDad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind
tthe paper.

<b>tANGLE ON TV --
</b>
<b>ttttNEWS REPORTER
</b>ttThe cult members have declined to
ttan on-camera interview but did send

tt-- which, by the way, appears to
tthave been written in blood -- reads...
ttt(reads the note)
ttTo the parents of Springwood --
ttFreddy lives! Soon he will come and
tttake one of your children as his
ttvirgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-
ttand his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and

ttshall be born. The vessel for Freddy
ttto rise and rule the darkness forever
ttand ever.

tA horn TOOTS outside.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttThat's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.

tMeagan collects her books and her sister. This is
tdad's cue to look at his watch and say:

<b>ttttMEAGAN'S DAD
</b>ttOh, look at the time! I've got to
ttbe going... anyone need me to bring
ttanything home tonight?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttI need an alarm clock.

<b>ttttMEAGAN'S DAD
</b>ttWhat's wrong with your old one?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttBroke.

tMeagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the
tdoor.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says:

</b>ttWe're almost out of vodka.

tMeagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off.

</b>
tMeagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching
this keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to
tsay something.

<b>ttttMEAGAN'S DAD
</b>ttDo you have to watch that crap all
ttthe time? Months and months of the
ttO.J. Simpson trial, and now this...

tMom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles
tslightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes,
tthen takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit
tinto her orange juice.  She takes a deep drink and
tswitches the set back on.

tCLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN
tRENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper.

<b>ttttNEWS REPORTER
</b>ttI'm standing here with State Trooper
ttCaptain Renton Murdoch, the man the
ttGovernor has called in to deal with
ttthe cultists because of his past
ttexperience with occult-style
ttmurderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch
ttis the only law enforcement officer
ttever to survive a one-on-one encounter
ttwith notorious Camp Crystal Lake
ttkiller -- Jason Voorhees.
ttt(to Murdoch)
ttYou received some pretty nasty
ttinjuries in your battle with Jason,
ttdidn't you, Captain?

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttNothing serious... just a few
ttstitches.

<b>ttttNEWS REPORTER
</b>ttWhat about these so called "Freddy"
ttcultists? They seem like pretty
tttough customers. Think you'll have
ttany trouble getting them out of
ttthere?

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttNo. Now that the Governor has given
ttme complete authority to deal with
ttthese punks I should be putting an
ttend to their situation pretty quick.
ttUnless of course their attorney is
ttable to get them to come out peace-
ttfully... but I don't hold out much
tthope for that.

<b>ttttNEWS REPORTER
</b>ttt(to camera)
ttCaptain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
ttgentlemen. A tough cop... for tough
ttcriminals.

<b>ttttt   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. "FREDDY" CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tMurdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next
tto the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel.

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttDamn media... oughtta be a law.
ttt(gestures to house)
ttIs that shyster still in there
tttrying to talk them out?

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttYeah... he's making them some kind
ttof deal.

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttDamn lawyers... what a bunch of
ttassholes. Shakespeare was right --
ttkill all the lawyers. Then we could
ttkill all the punks with no hassles
ttand the world would be a safer place.

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttSmaller anyway.

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttAhhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?
ttLong-haired, English freak. He was
ttprobably a punk.


<b>tINT. CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME
</b>
tMeanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER
tis sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room.
tHe is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage
tpunks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy.
tThey stare out at him through sunglasses with red
tflashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
tdisfigured faces.

tThe lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
ttakes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
tneatly on his lap.  Then he lifts his head, wiping
this nose nervously as he speaks:

<b>ttttSLEAZY LAWYER
</b>ttSo, as I explained to you before,
ttthe revenues between the TV movie
ttdeal and the book sale should be
ttadequate to fund your joint-defense.
ttAnd I think with my mass media
tthypnosis argument I could get each
ttof you a reduced sentence on appeal
tt-- say... twenty years each. Out
ttin fifteen with good behavior?
ttHmmmmm?

<b>tttttHARD CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tThe lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of
tan upstairs window, smacking into the command car's
twindshield with a loud SPLAT!

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttJesus Christ!

tMurdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging
tthe house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated
t.45s.  Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in
tthe house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars,
tSMASHING windows and emergency lights.

tThe S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail
tof GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door.


<b>tINT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT
</b>
tWHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
tS.W.A.T. team move in.  The windows have been covered
twith foil, the walls have been painted black with
tcult slogans written in red, making the whole house
tblack as pitch.  The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
tnight vision goggles and starts moving through the
thouse.

tP.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
tteam goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
tthe computer game DOOM).  Then a blinding flash of
tlight and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
tface.

tSeveral of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
tteam deeper into the house.  As one of the S.W.A.T.
tguys follows his foot trips a wire.  A trap door
topens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
ta pit, waist deep in water.  Suddenly, the water
tstarts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
ta tank of piranhas!  Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
this arms and pull him out.  Too late -- his legs
thave been shredded to the bone.

tAnother S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
tsteps in, FIRING his machine gun.  A large scythe
tswings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
tHis arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
tgun.

tThe cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
tbolted over head.  They swing like monkeys across
tthe ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
troom behind them.

tCLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
tcovered with upturned nails.  Several nails puncture
tboth boots, the points coming up through the laces.
tThe S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
tbarrels into the room to see what is wrong.  He knocks
tthe first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.

tMeanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
tHe kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
tcultists as they try to escape out a window.  As
tthe last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttFreeze!

tMurdoch exits, laughing to himself.

tThe running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
tretreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
tcocktails.  Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
tguy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.  The cultists
tthunder down a back staircase to the...


<b>tINT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tThe cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
thouse and most escape through the underground tunnel
tjust before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into
tthe basement.  As the last of the remaining cultists
tis capped off, a faint voice cries for help.  The
tS.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand.

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttHold your fire!

tHe pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
tflashlight into the basement.  Through the dense
tsmoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
tto a chair sitting on a crate.  Underneath the chair
t-- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE
<b>tON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28...
</b>
<b>ttttLITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
</b>ttHelp me, mister... please.

tThe S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling
tdown to look at the bomb.  Then he takes a Leatherman
ttool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's
ttimer.

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttHang on, honey... I'll have you
ttout of there in a second.

tMurdoch comes down the stairs.  He goes to the secret
tpassageway and says:

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttLooks like we'll have to hunt the
ttrest of them down. Let's go before
ttthey get too far.

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttWe can't leave! Can't you see
ttwe've got a situation here?

tMurdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs.

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttLeave her.

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttYou're crazy! I can't just leave
tther!

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttForget it. I've seen this before.
ttThere's nothing you can do.

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttI've got to try...

tThe S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in
tto work on the bomb again.  CLOSE ON TIMER: 24...
<b>t23... 22...
</b>
tThe basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks
tof BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T.
tteam.  Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion.

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttYou're wasting your time.

tThe S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another
tsecond, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14...
<b>t13...
</b>
<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttFuck it!

tThe S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife
tand cuts the little girl loose.  He carries her out
tin his arms as he shouts to his men:

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttt(continuing; yelling)
<b>ttCLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!
</b>
tThe S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch
tbringing up the rear.


<b>tEXT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT
</b>
tThe S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little
tgirl, followed closely with the remainder of his men
tand finally Murdoch.  The commander throws himself to
tthe ground, covering the little girl with his body as
t-- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES!

tMurdoch stands as debris rains down around him.  He
tmutters:

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttPunks.

tAs the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off
tthe little girl and starts checking her for injury.

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttAre you okay, honey?

tSuddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T.
tcommander, flashing a glove of knives.  She hisses:

<b>ttttLITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
</b>ttFreddy lives!

tWith a quick swing, the little girl slashes the
tcommander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to
this throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
tHe puts his boot on her, holding her down as he
ttakes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
tstyle.

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b><b>ttNO!
</b>
tThe S.W.A.T. commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in
ttime.  Several cops rush in and grab the girl,
tdragging her off, kicking and screaming.

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttJesus... you were going to kill
ttthat kid, weren't you?

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttI told you you were wasting your

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttYou can't be serious...

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttDead serious. See... the world is

ttsmokers mainly, watching their MTV...
ttSatanic lyrics melting what's left

ttup to be punks. And when these punks
ttstep as far over the line as these

</b>
tCLOSE ON GRAFFITI written across lockers -- FREDDY
<b>tLIVES!
</b>
tWe move from this to a small classroom window. Through
tit we see Meagan sitting in economics class.  The
tinstructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing.

<b>ttttMISS KREPPS
</b>tt(Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)

tIt's hot.  Several of the kids fan themselves,
tstruggling to stay awake while others have already
tpassed out on their desks.  Meagan's eyes are heavy.
tShe looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along
tin his book, fast asleep.  The antique oscillating
tfan on Miss Krepps' desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
ton:

<b>ttttMISS KREPPS
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt(Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)

tMeagan starts to drift off, when...

<b>ttttMISS KREPPS
</b>ttt(continuing; loud)
ttMeagan!?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttYes, ma'am?

<b>ttttMISS KREPPS
</b>ttI asked if you were ready to give
ttyour oral report?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttYes... I'm ready.

<b>ttttMISS KREPPS
</b>ttPlease come up here to the podium.

tMeagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
tsnickers of some of her classmates.  Miss Krepps
tsnaps her fingers for quiet.

<b>ttttMISS KREPPS
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou won't think it's funny when
ttyou haven't learned the fundamentals
ttof a free market economy... oh,
ttwhy do I waste my breath? You're
ttall going to grow up to be gas
ttstation attendants and waitresses
ttanyway. Go ahead, Meagan.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttMy report is on Global Economic
ttTrends.
ttt(clears throat;
tttt begins reading)
ttTry and think of a world where there
ttis no poverty... no sickness... no
ttcrime. A world where everyone is
tthappy to be alive and everyone lives
tttogether in peace. This is my dream.

tThe fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to CLICK louder,
tBLOWING harder.  Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
twith her report.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThis dream is becoming a reality
ttwith ever-growing international
ttbusiness...

tCLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes... getting creepier...
tturning into a Freddy-fan.  BLOWING harder... CLICKING
tlouder.

<b>ttttMISS KREPPS
</b>ttLouder, Meagan. We can't hear you.

tMeagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her
tvoice to be heard over the fan.  Then pages of her
treport start to blow away.  She grabs at them as the
tWIND increases.

tA bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
tspills to the floor at Meagan's feet.  She bends over
tto pick it up, when her skirt blows up.  She presses
tit down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
tbillows up, revealing her underwear.  The class roars
twith laughter.

<b>ttttMISS KREPPS
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLouder, Meagan... we still can't
tthear you.

tBut Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's
tbusy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP! --
tthe WIND blows her skirt off.  Her classmates fall
tover themselves, laughing.  RIP! -- Meagan's blouse
tblows away.  She tries to hide behind the podium when
tthat too is swept off.

tMeagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
tto drift away -- thread by thread.  She is almost
tnaked.  Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the
tface.

tHer classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
tall a bunch of old rotten skeletons.  And up front,
tin the center where Miss Krepps sat... is Freddy! He
twears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttAww... all dressed up and nowhere
ttto blow!

tMeagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands
tof cloth that cover her body.  She calls to Jesse,
tpleading:

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttJesse... please, help me.

tBut Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead.  He reaches
tup and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale,
texpressionless face.

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttLooks like a photo opportunity to
ttme!

tFreddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
tflashgun attached.  The flash bulb is the size of a
tbeach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
tfront.  Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
tsneers:

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSay... cheesecake!

tPHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
tlight.  Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
tagainst the blackboard -- vaporized!

<b>tttttHARD CUT TO:
</b>
tMeagan waking up in her seat suddenly.  The classroom
tas normal.  Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking:

<b>ttttMISS KREPPS
</b>ttMeagan? Meagan?!

tMeagan looks around, bewildered and confused.

<b>ttttMISS KREPPS
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI asked if you were ready to give

tMeagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
therself together.

ttMeagan?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttI'm waiting to see if you're going
ttto turn into Freddy.

<b>ttttSCHOOL NURSE
</b>ttFreddy... I see. You've been watching

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttBut this one was different... it
ttfelt real.

<b>ttttSCHOOL NURSE
</b>ttBut that's just it, Meagan... dreams

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttFear is real though, isn't it? And

ttAnd if the nightmares are real then

<b>ttttSCHOOL NURSE
</b>ttt(cutting her off)
ttMeagan! You've got heat prostration...

tThe nurse slaps a wet towel over her face.


<b>tINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tJesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
tnurse's office, muttering under her breath:

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttOld witch... what does she know?
ttShe isn't even qualified to give a
ttshot and she's telling me that my

</b>ttOh, sure... Madame Curie in there

ttRuined my makeup, too.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttSo you're going back to class?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttNo. She gave me last period off.

</b>ttWell, what are you bitching about?
ttI could have a compound fracture of

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttOkay... well, didn't the nurse say

tMeagan rolls her eyes in frustration.

</b>ttYou don't understand... I want to

ttmean... why we have them.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttOkay, Meg, go look it up. You've

</b>ttThat's a good idea. Why don't you

</b>ttSure. Where are we going?

</b>ttYou want me to cut school so we can

<b>ttttt   CUT TO:

tMeagan pours through a big psychology book.  Across
tthe table, Jesse peers into another psychology book.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttFind anything?

tJesse looks up suddenly.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttWhat? Oh, no... nothing yet.

tOver Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD &
tTRACK tucked inside his psychology book.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttDid you know that our sub-conscious
ttretains everything that ever happened
ttto us? Everything. From the time
ttwe're born until we die.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttReally?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttThat's how Freddy gets at us...
ttby using our sub-conscious fears.
ttFears our conscious minds have
ttrepressed or forgotten.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttI've got a news flash for you...
ttFreddy's dead.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttI'm not so sure... if Freddy exists
ttin our sub-conscious then he can
ttnever be fully erased. Like a bad

ttt(off Jesse's

ttWeren't you scared as a child by

</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttNo?

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttWell, yeah.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttWell, what? What is it?

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttWell... when I was kid, my brother
tttook me to the carnival. And in the
ttpenny arcade there was this robot
ttgunslinger...

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttBlack Bart.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttYou know about Black Bart?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttDuh. You put your quarter in and he
ttsays, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."
ttAnd then you pull your gun out and
ttshoot him.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttThat's just it -- I never could!
ttI'd point the gun right at him and
ttshoot, and I could never hit the guy.
ttSo I always got killed.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttNo one can hit him -- it's a gyp.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttScared the shit out of me.

tMeagan tries to hide her smile.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttt(continuing;
tttt flustered)
ttIsn't that scary? I mean... for a
ttkid?

tMeagan laughs.  Somebody shushes her.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttt(continuing;
tttt mad)
ttOkay, smartass... what about you?
ttWhat scared you the most as a kid?

tA dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttI remember... Lizzy wandered off
ttone day and we couldn't find her.
ttThe police came and everything. I
ttwasn't really worried until I saw
tther picture on TV... then I got
ttreally scared.
ttt(then)
ttJesse, I can't explain it... but I
ttthink something bad's going to
tthappen.

<b>tttttDISSOLVE TO:

</b>
tLizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching
ther books and Raggedy Ann doll... waiting. Behind
ther, wearing a protective helmet, another learning
tdisabled kid - LEONARD - taunts her.

<b>ttttLEONARD
</b>ttYou're stupid!

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttNo, you are!

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttNo they won't, because I'm walkin'

tLizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.  Leonard
tcalls after her:

<b>ttttLEONARD
</b>ttCome back, Lizzy! You can wait with
ttme! I got forgot too, you know!

tLizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school
tyard.  Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
tbumps into a passing CULTIST.  The cultist pushes him
tdown as he follows after Lizzy.

<b>ttttLEONARD
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttOkay... I'm going to have to report
ttthis!

tLizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
tshe's being followed.  She turns and sees a cultist
tstanding behind a tree several dozen yards behind her.
tLizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
tglances back, the figure is still standing... but
tcloser.

tScared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as
tshe flees down the sidewalk.  As she comes to the
tstreet, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
tof her, the door swinging open wide.  Burned arms
treach out to grab Lizzy.  She screams.

tThe cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as

</b>ttShe didn't come home from school

tthe unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
tattention to the floor next to the bed.

tLaying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
tincluding one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
tthe top.

ttright down the hall if you need me.

tThe guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the
tthick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant.
tThey exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a
tlittle closer to the glass.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttErwin...?

tSPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
tface to the glass as he screams:

<b>ttttERWIN
</b><b>ttSHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!
</b>
tMeagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they
tquickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's
tinspection.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhere do you shoot?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttShoot?

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttHe's talking about dream dope --
ttthe stuff the cultists shoot up
ttwith so they can talk to Freddy.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttI don't do drugs.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttYou're not in the cult?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttDidn't Freddy send you to kill me?

<b>ttttMEAGAN/STORMIE
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttI don't trust you... better take off
ttyour clothes so I can check you for
tttracks.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttChill, Erwin. We're here for some
tthard data -- not a floppy disk.

tErwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing
tto the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small
tmattress.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttWell, what do you want? Can't you
ttsee I'm busy?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttFreddy's cult kidnapped my sister.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttI told her you might know where
ttthey took her.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttI already told the cops everything
ttI know.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttTell me... please.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttLook... I'm sorry about your sister,
ttbut I've got my own problems with
ttFreddy. I'm a marked man, you know.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttThen tell me why they took her...

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttTo bear his child. Freddy wants to
ttbe human again. In order to do that
tthe has to be "reborn".

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttHow can he do that?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttHe has to marry a virgin on holy
ttground. Then the cult consumate
ttthe marriage by impregnating her.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttThe whole cult? Yeech!

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttFreddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.
ttIt's sort of a tradition with him.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttSo the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttAnd Freddy enters the soul of the
ttfetus through a dream state. Voila!
ttRebirth.

tThere is a moment as the girls take this in, then:

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttThat's the stupidest shit I ever
ttheard.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttHey, they're not my rules... some-
ttbody else wrote 'em.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttErwin... you've got to help me find
ttLizzy. You're my only hope.

tErwin thinks about this for a second, then:

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttI'll help you find your sister, but
ttyou've got to help me.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttAnything. Just name it.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttYou have to help me kill Freddy.

tMeagan and Stormie exchange looks.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttBut Freddy's dead.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttFreddy lives...
ttt(looks at Meagan)
ttIf only in our dreams.

tStormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
ther away.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttCome on, Meagan... our five minutes
ttis up. He's giving me the creeps.

tBut Meagan stays put and asks Erwin:

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttHow can you kill a dream?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttWhen it's not a dream.
ttt(then)
ttDo we have a deal?

tErwin presses his palm against the glass.  Meagan
tthinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass
tover his.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttDeal.

tMeagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of

</b>ttNo! I won't do it!

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttCome on, Jesse! Please...?

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttIt's illegal! I could go to jail!

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttHow will they ever know? Don't be

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttOh, yeah? Why don't you call then?

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttOkay, I will!

</b>ttNo! They'll never believe her!

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttI can disguise my voice...
ttt(lowers voice)
ttHello, how do you do? My name is
ttJesse. I think I'm a man but I'm
ttactually a wimp.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttThey'll never believe that. Come
tton, Jesse... for me?

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttOkay... okay... I'll do it.
ttt(to Stormie)
ttAnd I'm not a wimp!

tJesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.  After a
tmoment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately
tboth girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
tthe call.  Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
tgirls shut up, he says:

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI need a quarter for the phone.

tMeagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.  Jesse
tre-enters the booth.

tANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number.


<b>tINT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT
</b>
tThe security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.

<b>ttttSECURITY GUARD
</b>ttSpringwood Mental Center... how
ttcan I help you?

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttt(filtered; disguising

ttThere's a bomb planted in your

<b>ttttSECURITY GUARD
</b>ttWho is this?

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttIf I were you -- I'd get my ass

tIn the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
tsomething to Jesse.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttt(continuing; adding)
ttOh, yeah... Freddy Lives.

tCLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.


<b>tEXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER
</b>
tThe peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
tfire ALARM.  Soon all the INMATES start filing out
tinto the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.  Erwin
tfiles out with the others, still wearing his straight
tjacket.

tErwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car
tflashes it's lights.  Erwin starts to casually wander
toff towards the fence between himself and freedom
twhen the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says:

<b>ttttSECURITY GUARD
</b>ttHey, Erwin... where do you think
ttyou're going?

tErwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.

<b>ttttSECURITY GUARD
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI'm talking to you, asshole!

tErwin breaks into a run.  The guard takes off after
thim.

tIn the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the
tguard closes the distance.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttHe's not going to make it.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttWe've got to do something!

tWith grim determination, Jesse starts his car.

tJesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for
tthe fence.  With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car
tdrives into the fence, knocking that section down.
tErwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into
tan open window.  Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the
tRENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence,
tdoes a 180, and PEELS off.

tANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
tof his straight jacket.  Once freed, Erwin extends his
thand to Jesse.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttHi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for
ttbusting me out of there!

tJesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the
tfingertips are all heavily bandaged.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttYeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do
ttme one favor -- don't eat nothing
ttdisgusting. My stomach is tight
ttenough as it is.

tThe security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and
tpuffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the
tstreet.  Then he spots something in the fence and
tplucks it out...

tJesse's front license plate.

<b>ttttt   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - DUSK
</b>
tCLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists
tclose in around her.  They rip her sleeve off and
tinject her with a syringe.  After a moment, Lizzy
tstarts to settle down... falling asleep...

tThe cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
ther towards the big boiler.  Inside -- a raging INFERNO.

tLIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach
tthe boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant
tgate.  The two halves swing open wide to reveal...


<b>tINT. HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tA narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop
ta tall, narrow mountain.  On either side of the ledge
tis a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
tof hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled
twith LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.  Hundreds upon
thundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
tterrible chorus of the damned.

tThe cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
tthe mausoleum.  The outside of this ancient structure
tis engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
tmankind.  In the center -- a large iron gate that
tswings open as the cultists near.

tThe cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding
ther tight as they push her face forward into the
tmirror.  The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's
tface disappearing into the mirror.

tANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's
tface stares out into utter blackness.  Then, some-
tthing large and evil looking swims up out of the
tdarkness.  Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by
tthe sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head
tmoves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
tout.

tThe evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss,
tlocking it's lips over hers.  Several slippery some-
tthings slither into her mouth.  Lizzy struggles, but
tthe big evil thing is way too strong.  Finally, it
treleases her and the cultists pull her back out.

tThe cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
tthe...


<b>tINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tHorribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
tconscious state.  Her eyes grow wide with fear again
tas she opens her mouth to scream.  Suddenly, she
tdoubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
tcultist thrusts under her.

tThree evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's
tmouth -- the Dream Demons.


<b>tEXT. OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK
</b>
tSeveral shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car
tpulls up next to a run-down building.


<b>tINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tErwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the
told, burnt out boiler room.  They work their way
ttowards the back, to a large table and a collection
tof sofas and easy chair scattered about.  Erwin
tstarts sniffing around, pointing out several used
tsyringes laying scattered about the floor.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttDamn! We must have just missed them!

tMeagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttOh, my God -- she was here! This
ttis part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all

ttt(grabs Erwin)
ttErwin... we've got to find her!

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttWe're too late! There's no way...
ttexcept...

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttExcept what?!

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttWe could go after Freddy.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttHow?

tErwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way
tup underneath.  After fishing around for a moment,
the draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
tbox.  Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes,
tand several pairs of cult shades.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttWe'll inject ourselves with Dream
ttDope.  It's a mild narcotic that
ttbrings on a dreamlike state.

tMeagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her
tapproval.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttOkay... let's do it!

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttMeagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,
ttwhat if one of us gets hooked or
ttsomething?
ttt(whispers)
ttWe could turn out like him!

tJesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttDon't worry about it. We need you
ttwide awake anyway.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttWhat for?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttWe're going to go under and try to
ttfind Freddy. When we do, we'll grab
tthim and bring him here. Then you
ttkill him with this...

tErwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttThis rusty chunk of shit? What
ttgood is this?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttIt's not the gun, it's what's in
ttit -- silver bullets blessed by a
ttpriest.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttWill that work?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttt(shrugs)
ttShould. But then...

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttt(finishes for him)
ttYou don't make the rules... yeah,
ttyeah.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttWhat should we do?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttHave a seat over there and make
ttyourselves comfortable. Roll up
ttyour sleeves and put these on...

tErwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
tsunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens.
tStormie puts hers on immediately and says:

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttOh, cool!

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttWhat are they for?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttIt's how the cult keeps in constant
ttcontact with Freddy. The little
ttlights flashing are a sustained
ttoccular input that causes your brain
ttto resonate at approximately the
ttsame frequency at which the dream
ttstate is most likely to occur.

tAll of this went over Meagan's head.  Stormie shrugs:

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttWhatever...
ttt(to Meagan; excited)
ttPut 'em on -- they're really cool!

tMeagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling
tup their sleeves.  Erwin comes over and reclines the
tchairs, giving each girl an injection.  Then Erwin
ttakes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.  He
tlets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
tglasses.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttIt helps to hold hands if you want
ttto go together...

tMeagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.  Jesse
twatches with skepticism and concern.  Erwin ushers
ta final warning:

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAnd remember... Freddy knows what
ttscares you.

tThen all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into...

<b>tINT. DREAMSPACE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tMeagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace
t(fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands.
tThe girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells:

</b>

</b>
tJesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all
tasleep in their chairs.


<b>tINT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT
</b>
tMeagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
tmare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
tpictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
tfixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.  As
tthey get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttt(distant)
ttMeagan... help me... please...

tMeagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
tsuddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.  Stormie
tand Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttFreddy's trying to split us up...


<b>tINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
tJesse is standing in front of an old, full length
tmirror, practicing drawing the pistol.  He pulls it
tand pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from
tthe muzzle as he says:

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttOkay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff
ttin Dreamland now.


<b>tINT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT
</b>
tStormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
tboiler room, calling for Meagan.  A strange shadow
tstalks them -- it's Freddy.  He drops down in front
tof Erwin and Stormie.

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttLooking for some-body?

tFreddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
tlost souls.  In the center -- Meagan.  Stormie charges
tFreddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
tto Erwin:

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttI've got him! Wake us up! Wake
ttus up!

tBut Erwin is paralyzed with fear.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttDon't just stand there! Wake us up!

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttHmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.

tSuddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
tclaws.  She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
tStormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
tFreddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
tapron.

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttStew on this, bitch!

tFreddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.  She
tfalls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!

<b>tttttHARD CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT
</b>
tStormie wakes with a start, yelling:

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttShoot him! Shoot him!

tJesse spins, aiming the pistol.  But nothing is there.


<b>tINT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
tFreddy turns toward Erwin.

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttWell, well, well... if it isn't
ttmy ol' pal, Erwin.

tErwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot.

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI've got something special in mind
ttfor you...

tSuddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
tout a pin.  Freddy gawks -- surprised.  Erwin pricks
this finger.

<b>tttttHARD CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

ttYou gutless... spinless... jelly

tJesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.

tIt leads her to her house.  Meagan enters the front

</b>ttDaddy?

tHe looks up and quietly shushes her.

<b>ttttMEAGAN'S DAD
</b>ttShuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...

tAnd with that, Meagan's dad disappears.  Only the

tagain... upstairs.

tAs she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes
ther mother's room.  The door is open a crack.  Meagan
tlooks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle
tto her lips.  The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's

tMeagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry
tfor help draws her to...

</b>ttAre you okay?

tThey help Meagan to her feet.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttt(shaky)

</b>ttHe killed me, too. But look...

tStormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is

tMeagan gets to her feet, asking:

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttNow that I think about it -- he's
ttkilled me in all my nightmares. But
ttI'm not dead... what does it mean?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttIt means we've still got some time

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttHello. The Dream Demons...?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttFreddy made a pact with Satan when
tthe died... so Satan bestowed upon
tthim the Dream Demons. They're the

ttt(off Jesse's cynical

ttHey, like I said... I don't make

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttBut we've still got a chance, right?
ttA chance to kill Freddy before he

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttWe already tried that. There's no

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttThen let's get somebody else. Some-
ttbody strong.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttYeah! We could hire somebody to
ttkill Freddy -- like a hit man!

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttYou would have to hire a thousand

</b>ttWhere are you going to find a hit

</b>ttUh... excuse me, Einstein... but

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttSeriously dead. Buried up by Crystal

ttknow how to bring him back to life.

<b>ttttJESSE
</b>ttSomehow I just knew you would.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttBut that's not the problem. The

ttwhat we tell him.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttWell, that's okay... as long as he
ttdoesn't chop us all up.

tErwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttErwin... I'm trusting you on this,

ttif we do this -- if we go and get
ttJason and bring him back to life,
ttthat he could kill Freddy?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttNo doubt about. Jason could wreck

ttBut if Freddy has home court advan-

tMeagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse.

</b>ttLet me get this straight... we're

</b>ttThat's about the size of it... and

tIn his shack, listening to a small portable radio,
tis the NIGHT WATCHMAN.  His small DOG suddenly perks
tup her ears and GROWLS low.  The watchman turns down
tthe radio.

<b>ttttNIGHT WATCHMAN
</b>ttWhat's matter, girl... you hear
ttsomethin'?

tThen the old man hears it, too... A low RUMBLE. Moving
tcloser.

tThe night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
tinto the darkness when a line of several hearses
tapproaches.  The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
tthe driver's window rolls down.

<b>ttttNIGHT WATCHMAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhat's this? A funeral procession?

tA Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
tand says:

</b>ttThat's exactly what it is.

<b>ttttNIGHT WATCHMAN
</b>ttt(suspicious)
ttYeah? Whose?

<b>ttttCULTIST
</b>ttYours.

tBANG! -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
tthe head.  The night watchman falls to the ground with
ta lifeless THUD.  The little dog starts BARKING
tferociously when another SHOT silences her as well.

tAnother cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
tthe gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
tcutters.  He swings the gate open and the funeral
tprocession proceeds inside.


<b>tINT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - A SHORT TIME LATER
</b>
tThe cultists are standing around a small pit that two
tcultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
twrecking yard.  Inside the pit, the uncovered remains
tof Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
tcharred bones.

tLizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists,
tand injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
taround.  She no longer struggles, accepting her fate
twith droopy eyes.

tLIZZY'S DREAM DOPE P.O.V. -- as she watches one of
tthe cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
tFreddy's broken jawbone.  Her vision gets blurry...
tmore surreal as another cult member steps forward
twith the tupperware.  He pours the dream demons into
tthe funnel.

tCLOSE ON FREDDY'S REMAINS as the dream demons swim
taround inside his skull.  His bones start to bleed...
tblood becoming arteries and veins... vessels becoming
tmuscle... muscle growing scarred flesh...

tThere is a FLASH from the pit.  Then suddenly, Freddy
tKrueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him --
tleaps out of the pit and cries:

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttSmokin'!

tLizzy rolls her eyes up and faints.  The cultists
tFIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the

tErwin shines his light on Jason's grave.

tBeneath the death date, crudely scratched into the
tstone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc.

tJesse and Erwin start digging.

tELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig.
tStormie and Meagan take their turn.  Then... Jesse
thits something solid.

tHands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the
tcoffin below.  Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
tjams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open.

tThe casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! --
tnoxious gas escapes.  Everyone covers their mouth
tand nose, suppressing the urge to hurl.

tThen roaches... hundreds of roaches.

tMeagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at
ttheir hair and clothing.  Jesse rolls around on
tthe ground.  Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his

<b>tttttCUT TO:

tMeagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave,

ttape around the cuffs of their pants.  They aren't
ttaking anymore chances with bugs.

tJesse and Erwin open the casket.  Everyone recoils
tat the stench.  Then they shine their lights inside

tMeagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another

tthe night.

tMeagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly
tto herself as she drifts off to sleep:

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>tt...merrily, merrily, merrily,
ttmerrily... life is but a dream.

tIn the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's
tbreasts, sucking his thumb.  Both are fast asleep.

tJesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids
tdrooping.  The car starts to weave.

ta cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL

</b>
tJesse shakes his head -- nah!  He tries to concentrate
ton the road, his eyelids falling once more.

tJesse's car zooms past a billboard.  Behind the bill-
tboard -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking
tout of the driver's window.

tCLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-
tground, the red digits cascading up.

tFreddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind
tthe wheel.  The radar gun's display is reflected in
this mirrored shades.  It reads: KILL THEM.

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttShouldn't dream and drive.

tFreddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes
tout from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --
tit's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
tbelching HELLFIRE.

tANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids
tclose and his head nods forward, revealing the night-
tmaremobile closing from behind fast.

tThe nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's
tcar just an inch from the bumper.  Freddy moves one
tof the dozen of levers on the dash.

tCLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version
tof Freddy's glove.  It extends out towards the back
tof Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into
tthe trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The
ttrunk lid opens.

tANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's
tremains are moving!  Freddy works another level and
tthe tiny glove slits each bag.  The various pieces
tof Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out
tof the bag.

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLooks like the cat's out of the
ttbag now!

tFreddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.

tThe nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's
tcar, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --
tall four occupants of the car are jolted awake,
tstartled.  Meagan looks out her window and sees the
tnightmaremobile as it closes in again.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttIt's Freddy!

tWHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs
tas he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the
tdozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
tmaremobile, staring out at her through the back window.
tA small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD.

tJesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,
tthe pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the
tback seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front
tseat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines
tEXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING
ttheir way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's
tboots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards
tthe gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay
tunder the back window and kick Erwin in the head.

tAs Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,
tshe looks down and sees Jason's other hand between
ther legs.  Meagan screams.

tJason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches
tforward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile
tSLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it
tto swerve violently from side to side.

tInside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.

tCLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
tup and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING
tinto Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside,
tMeagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,
tCUTTING forward towards...

tCLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
tit.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the
troad, veering into a tree line.

tCRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,
tthe HORN stuck on, BLARING.

tFreddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
toverdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
tEXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.

tIn the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go
ton inside.

tThe passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
tground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear
tdoor opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in
tembrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers
taround to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse
tis laying unconscious against the steering wheel.
tMeagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.
tJesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.

</b>ttDon't worry... an ambulance is on

tMeagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttOh, God... Jesse...

tErwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the
tgarbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --
tuntouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says:

</b>ttMeagan... listen to me... The cops
ttare on their way. If they find me

</b>ttIs he going to be okay?

<b>ttttDOCTOR
</b>ttYes. But he needs a lot of rest.
ttHis leg is broken in four places

tOn the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.  Freddy
tpeeks out from behind the other side.  He snickers and
tducks back down.

tSuddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed
tand grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.

tMeagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs

tinside, climbing in after her and asking:

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttWhere'd you get the truck?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttSame place I've got Jason hid.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttAnd where's that?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttA place where no one ever goes.

tStormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
tout of the parking lot.

tThe pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather-
tworn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

tErwin drives the truck through the deserted camp,
tpast the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a
tshort distance away from the pier and the three of
tthem climb out.

tMeagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her
tas Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
tplatform tied up to the end.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttWhat'd you do -- take him for a
ttswim?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttAlmost.

tErwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center,
ta large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie
tdown onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the
tpier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant.
tErwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan,
tasks:

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIs she going to be alright?

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttI don't know. She's pretty fucked
ttup. God, I don't know why I'm not...

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttYou're a strong woman.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttWhat's that supposed to mean?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttUhhh... nothing. I didn't mean
ttanything.

tStormie gestures to the tarp.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttIs this him?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttYeah...
ttt(whips back tarp)
ttMeet the new and improved Jason.

tANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
tplatform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
tcoiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has
tdone a good job of sewing Jason back together with
tbarbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have
tbeen reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's
tmask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with
tbailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttWhy'd you put that stupid mask
tton him?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttTake a look...

tStormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
tand quickly replaces it.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttGood idea.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttNot exactly a beauty queen entry,
ttis he?

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttSo what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy
ttOsbourne song backwards or something?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttI'm afraid it's not that simple...

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttI thought you said you knew how to
ttbring him back to life?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttI do! But when I was putting him
ttback together, I noticed something
ttwas missing.

tStormie thinks about this for a second, then:

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttAwwww, he won't be needing that...
ttI mean, what girl would let him
ttput his rotten ol'...

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttt(cuts her off)
ttNo-no! Not that! It's his heart...
ttit's missing.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttWell... does it really matter?
ttCan't you use an aquarium pump or
ttsomething?

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttNo... he has to have a heart. A
tthuman heart. A good one.

tMeagan speaks for the first time:

</b>ttI know where we can get a heart...
ttA good one.

<b>tEXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
tA sign reads: CITY MORGUE.  Through the front window
ta GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk.
tErwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up,
tparked a safe distance away.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttThat guard in there might pose a
ttproblem.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttDo you think you and Stormie could
ttkeep him occupied for a few minutes?

tErwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why
tnot?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttOkay... let's do it.

tA few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick-
tup swerves wildly into the parking lot.  He gets up
tand goes to the glass door, peering out.

tANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
tmaking out -- hot and heavy.


<b>tINT. MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>
tMeagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She
tcrawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
tto the floor.  She shines her flashlight around the
tdark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars
tfull of organs, etc.

tCrossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens
tone of the drawers and shines her light inside --
tug!  Wrong guy.  She opens the next drawer -- ick!
tEven worse.

tMeagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.  Her lip starts
tto quiver as she caresses his face.


<b>tEXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME
</b>
tAt the glass door, the guard is watching the action
tin the parking lot, his breath fogging the window.
tHe wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
tbetter look.

tInside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttHey! Watch that!

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttI'm just trying to make it look real.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttJust keep your hands above the bra,

tThe windows are starting to steam up.


<b>tINT. MORGUE - SAME TIME
</b>
tMeagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
tgloves.  Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
tments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large
tknife.

tMeagan stands over Jesse's body.  She pulls back the
tsheet, exposing his chest.  Meagan raises the knife
tfar above her head.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttForgive me, Jesse...

tMeagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a
tsickening THWACK!


<b>tEXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME
</b>
tThe windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,
tobscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips,
tdeciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks
tthe front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.
tThey spot him coming and break their embrace.  In
tanother moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the
tparking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes
this head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.

tUp the street, parked with the lights off in the night
tshade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the
tguard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
tthe morgue.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttHe's head right for her! Do some-
ttthing!

tErwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN.


<b>tINT. MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT
</b>
tMeagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
tchest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
tfiber keeps pulling it back.  She jumps at the HORN,
tthen starts pulling harder.

tIn the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
tand stops.  He starts back for the front, when suddenly
tthe HORN stops.

tMeagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
tto Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan
ttumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.

tThe guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
tdrawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully
tunlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.  Taking a
ttwo-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
tand kicks the door.

tWHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
tinside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
tHe gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.  One
tof the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
ta huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
ta bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
tcabinet...

tSuddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
tand cries:

<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttStop right there!

tMeagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
tThe unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.  The guard
tcurses and races for the...


<b>tEXT. MORGUE - SECONDS LATER
</b>
tThe guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
tclose the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.  He
tshrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.  The
tguard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
tthat the door has closed and locked behind him.

<b>tEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT
</b>
tMeagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently
tas Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using
tdental floss.  Stormie comes up behind her and puts
ther jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside
ther and says:

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttYou've got to quit blaming your-
ttself for what happened to Jesse...
ttit wasn't your fault.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttHe didn't want to come with us...
ttbut he did anyway. He did it for me.

</b>ttI'm not sorry I came... I don't

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttI just can't believe he's dead. I
ttkeep thinking he'll show up any
ttminute...

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttWell, that just about does it...

tErwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
tthe pier, cutting the diving platform free.  He kicks
tit off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free.
tThen Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading
tthem over to where a short trench has been dug leading
tfrom the water's edge.

tIn the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
tcable.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAs you can see, I've excavated the
ttpower cable that runs across the
ttbottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut
ttaway the insulation, exposing a
ttpatch of cable right near the water's
ttedge.

tErwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
tat the head of the trench.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttNow when I kick this over, the water
ttwill wash down the trench and bridge
ttan eletrical gap between the cable
ttand the lake. There's plenty of
ttvoltage, so it should work.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttSo you kick the bucket and Jason
ttlives.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttYeah, right...
ttt(then)
ttOkay, keep your fingers crossed...

tErwin kicks the bucket over.  The water washes down
tthe trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP!
tA huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.  Then the lake begins to
tglow and the water begins to churn.  Erwin and the
tgirls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake,
tengulfing the diving platform.

tThe ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
tonto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing.

tCLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
tspirals down into the eye hole like water running
tdown a drain.

tCLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!  We dive into the

tCLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask)
treflected in the water.  A young hand reaches up and
tpulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy
tbeneath.  This is JASON -- AGE 9.

tJASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
tdown cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of
trye. He bellows:

<b>ttttJASON'S FATHER
</b>ttJason! Git your ass over here!

tJason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only
tslightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly
tseveral paces away.

</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhat did I teach you, boy? Don't
ttever take your mask off out in
ttpublic. I don't want nobody to see

tJason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father
tsmacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the
twoodshed.

ttGo git in the woodshed.

tknows what's coming next.

</b>ttt(continuing)
ttDrop them overalls and lay over

tJason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt.
tSuddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway,
tcalling:

<b>ttttJASON'S MOTHER
</b>ttJason! Come here!

tJason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries
ttowards his mother.

<b>ttttJASON'S FATHER
</b>ttWhat are you doing woman?

tJason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with
tdollars and change.

<b>ttttJASON'S MOTHER

</b>ttYou ain't sending him nowhere.

ttBring me that money, boy!

tJason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to
tobey, when his mother shoos him away.

<b>ttttJASON'S MOTHER
</b>ttGo on now... go!

tJason takes off up the road.  His father sneers:

<b>ttttJASON'S FATHER
</b>ttGoin' ag'in me? I'll take you to
ttthe shed, woman!

tJason's mother pulls a knife from her apron.

<b>ttttJASON'S MOTHER
</b>ttYou ain't ever taking anyone to

tJason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him
tback into the shed with the knife.  Jason looks back.
tThrough the open window he sees his mother's arm
tcoming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's
tarms flailing helplessly.  Then both disappear from
tview.  After a moment his mother appears in the door-
tway, spattered with blood.  She smiles and waves to
thim, calling:

<b>ttttJASON'S MOTHER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttGo on, son... have a good time!
ttMommy will come and git you some

tJason turns and runs to...

tto the camp with his jar of money.

tThe other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him...

tbreaks away, running towards the pier.

tJason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own
treflection.  He removes the mask and watches as the
tdistortions in the water make his face look normal.

tSomeone comes up behind Jason slowly.  Jason isn't
taware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
tappears behind his own.  Jason turns to see who when
the is suddenly pushed into the lake.

tJason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to
tstay afloat.  A hand pushes his head back under the
twater.

tJASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of
twhoever is holding him under.

tJason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to
tthe surface... fighting just to see who is killing
thim before he dies.

<b>tttttHARD CUT TO:

tthe electricity all over him like a spider web. On
tshore, Erwin and the girls gasp.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttHoly shit! It worked!

tMeagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.  But something
tis wrong.  Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable
tto break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttIt's kill him! Shut it off! Shut
ttit off!

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttShut it off... it suddenly occurs
ttto me that I hadn't really planned
ttfor that contingency.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttJust don't stand there! Do something!

tBut all Erwin can do is scratch his head.  Meagan
trushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttJason! JASON! You've got to get up!
ttDo you hear me? Get up!

tJason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
tagainst the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.  Water
trushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW!

tA power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan
tand her friends to cringe.  When they look back, the
telectrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but
tsmoke and floating debris.  Meagan and Stormie turn to
tErwin, who shrugs shyly and says:

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttWell... it's off now.

tMeagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
tshrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.  He cowers
tbetween them, offering quick excuses and humble
tapologies.

tAll three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
tnever notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from
tthe lake.

tThen they do see him... scream and run.  Jason charges
tafter the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer"
tgait.

tErwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
tdash past.  He closes the door behind him and squirms
tout a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
tand steps inside.  Erwin races around to the front
tand closes the door.  He fastens the latch and padlock,
tthen calls to the girls:

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey! Come back! I've got him locked

tJust then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
tthrough the tool shed door.  Erwin screams like a
tgirl and runs away.


<b>tINT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

tMeagan and Stormie run into the main room.  Stormie

</b>ttThe cops! Who else?!

</b>ttAre you kidding?! They'll lock us

ttDamnit! It's dead!

tJust then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming
tthe door shut behind him.

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttHe's right behind me!

tStormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough,
tJason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttt(to Erwin)
ttYou're the one who brought him

tErwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside.
tStormie clucks:

ttOh, some hero!

tJust then, the chainsaw RIPS through the front door.
tMeagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
tcloset, closing themselves inside.

tThey cower in the closet, listening... for a long
tmoment... nothing but the sound of their heavy
tbreathing.

tThen, with the RIPPING of WOOD, Jason chainsaws the
tcloset door -- knocking it to the floor.  Erwin draws
tout his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger.

tJason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands
tup in front of him and yells:

</b>
tTo everyone's shock... Jason does.

</b>ttt(continuing)
ttNow... just stop! We're the ones

ttAnd you have no right to kill us

<b>ttttSTORMIE
</b>ttThat's right! She gave you her

</b>ttThat's right.

tJason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLook! Here's his picture...

tMeagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
topens the locket.  She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
tinside.  Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
tin his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of
tJesse with a meaty finger.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttNow, I know that you've been through

ttI know I would be!

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttBut if you help us kill Freddy
ttKrueger... I promise to help you
ttfind the little bastard that
ttkilled you. What do you say? Have
ttwe got a deal?

tMeagan sticks out her hand to shake.  Jason stares at
tit, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan. Finally,
the reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when...

tBrilliant, blinding white light blazes through the
twindows, freezing everyone to the spot.  Anxious to
tget out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across
tthe floor and peeks out over the window sill.

tANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
tlights towards the cabin, two dozen COPS aim their
tweapons.  In the middle of this impressive show of
tforce is Murdoch.  He raises a bullhorn to his lips.

<b>ttttMURDOCH

ttYou in there! This is Captain Renton
ttMurdoch -- State Trooper! I am

tMeagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the
tcloset.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttJason, you have to hide! Stay in
tthere and don't come out until we
tttell you. Stormie... help me!

tStormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet,
tclosing the door.  Then they quickly smooth down
ttheir hair and clothes, moving towards the door.


<b>tEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND
</b>
tMeagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands
traised high above their heads.  As they walk towards
tthe police cars, several of the S.W.A.T. team moves
tin and arrests them.  As they are handcuffed and
tsearched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again:

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttThere's no one else inside.

ttOkay... you had your chance!

tSuddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin
tand shouts:

tJason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too.
tMurdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out
ta pistol, he holds a laser designator.  Murdoch fires.

tA big red dot appears on Jason's chest.  Jason looks
tdown at it like it was a harmless bug.  He looks back

tA cop behind him says:

tMeagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in

tErwin is put into another car and the three exchange
tworrisome looks through the windows just before the

tAs the cops start to pull out, one of them notices
tsomething moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING

</b>ttHey... do you see that?

tBut just then, the form falls through the BURNING

tHe shrugs it off and exits after his partner.

tBoth girls stand in their cells next to eachother,

tThe deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
tthat she doesn't notice the strange shadow that
tpasses behind her.

tThe shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by
ta slight SCRAPING.  Freddy's glove materializes,
traking the knives along the metal cross bars.  Freddy
tstops at Stormie's cell, looking inside.

tStormie is fast asleep.

tFreddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through

tjumps to her feet and screams.

</b>ttHelp! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!

tBut the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't

tright in the nose.

tStormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her

tShe screams.

tFreddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right

<b>ttttBOOGERMAN
</b>ttUh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose

tBoogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the

tFreddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering
tclosely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He
ttwists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-

tBoogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack-

tflattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo,
this nasty head still alive in the center.

tFreddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm

tthe deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until
the touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into
tStormie's cell.

tFreddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
tright palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
tof pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
tclings to life deep inside the nostril.

tAn ambulance races along the road with it's emergency
tlights flashing.  In back Erwin lays strapped to a
tgurney.  Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.  They
tchat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when
tsuddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead.
tThe driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
twith a terrible SQUEAL.

tWHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking
tit some fifty feet down the road.  The driver and the
tattendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock.
tFinally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:

<b>ttttAMBULANCE DRIVER
</b>ttI'll go check it out. You stay here.

tThe driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
troad.  He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth
tcarcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in
tthe face.  He falls to the ground, unconscious.

tThe corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
tit's Jason!  Burnt and blackened but ready for action!
tHe starts towards the ambulance.

tThe attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver,
temptying into Jason's chest.  Jason recoils only
tslightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he
tgrabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
tpistol in panic.  Jason slams the attendant's face
tinto the side of the ambulance.

tIn the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin
twatches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
ta sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.  Then...
tsilence.

tRIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
tand climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his
tweight.  He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his
teyes... waiting for the inevitable.

tThen... nothing.

tAfter a second, Erwin opens an eye.  Jason is standing
tover him, hand outstretched.  In his big, burnt palm
t-- Meagan's necklace.  Erwin looks from the necklace
tto Jason.  Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.

</b>ttYou... want me to tell you where

ttOkay... okay! I'll take you right
ttto her. Could you help me out of

tJason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps.

tErwin exits out the back with Jason following close
tbehind.  Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:

</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI'll drive.

tJason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
tthe passenger side door.

ttOkay... you drive.

tAs Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes
toff as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says:

</b>ttFasten your safety belt, please.

tErwin fastens his.  Jason watches him and pulls the
tsafety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach.
tJason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts.
tThe CHIME goes crazy.

ttFasten your safety belt, please...

tJason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing

tto say, "Yeah?! What about it?"  Erwin shrugs nervously:

tcatcall.

tJust then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan

</b>ttOh... well... the cops? Well, they

tThe head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan
twere Satan himself.  She runs for the other bitches
tbut they aren't having anything to do with her.  All
tthe bitches race for the exit.

tThe deputy comes to the shower room doorway and
tshouts:

<b>ttttDEPUTY
</b>ttWhat the hell is all the screaming
ttabout?!

tWHAM! -- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys
tfrom her belt.  They unlock the cellblock door and go
trunning into the police station, screaming butt-naked.
tAfter the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and
tdrags the unconscious deputy into the shower.

tThe bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
tthrough the station.  Several deputies chase after
tthem, tackle them and try to cuff them.  A brawl
tensues.  Chaos.

tMurdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.  He looks
tup at the madness and mutters:

</b>ttPunks...


<b>tINT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

tA DEPUTY enters the showers and sees a naked woman
ton top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle.
tThe deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the
thead with her baton and she falls to the side,
trevealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's
tuniform -- laying on the shower floor.

tThe deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan
tsprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to
ther knees, screaming and clutching her face.  Meagan
tleaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her
tface (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit.

tOn her way out, Meagan is passed by several DEPUTIES
tcharging into the showers to restore order.  She
tgestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit
tto freedom.


<b>tEXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tMeagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls
tup.  She reaches in and grabs the JUNIOR TROOPER,
tpulling him out.  Then she slips behind the wheel
tand ROARS off.  The junior trooper calls after her:

tThe cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously
tshakes his head, saying:

</b>ttI won't do it! It's a sin!
ttBlasphemy!

tOne of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs. Lovejoy's head.

<b>ttttCULTIST
</b>ttWedding or funeral... your choice.

tThe reverend swallows and says:

<b>ttttREVEREND LOVEJOY
</b>ttAnd who would be the bride?

tLizzy is brought forth.  The cultists take her arm
tand inject her with the dream dope.  Lizzy's head
tlulls around as she chants softly:

tThe rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the

tThe good reverend watches this with a lump in his

</b>ttHe's coming...

tLizzy is almost asleep.

tThe neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker.
tThen with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross
tfalls over, turning upside down.  It hangs there for

tthe curtains on FIRE.

tAs the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality
tappears -- a Dreamgate.  Freddy comes springing out,

tto Lizzy, asleep on the bench.

ttTake me, Freddy. Take me instead.

tOutside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the

tthe fence.  Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander get
tout of the lead car.  Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
tand says:

</b>ttt(through bullhorn)
ttThis is Captain Renton Murdoch --
ttState Trooper. I'm giving you until
ttthe count of three to come out with

tA CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch, the bullet
thit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car.  The
tother cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns
tcalmly to the S.W.A.T. commander and says:

<b>ttttMURDOCH
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHand me that flare pistol.

tThe commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding:

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttGood idea. Throw a little light on

ttfiring positions...

tAs the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol
tcarefully and FIRES.  PHOOMPH! -- the flare streaks
tto the roof of the TV station, SMACKING the sniper.
tHe BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground,
tscreaming.  Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
tcommander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:

</b>ttt(through bullhorn)
ttAlright, now I'm through playing
tt"nice guy" -- I want the rest of

tThe cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
t-- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars, SMASHING glass

tEXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station.

tThe cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
tdream dope.  She takes her place at the threshold
tbeside Freddy.


<b>tEXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - SAME TIME
</b>
tAs the battle outside between the cultists and the
tcops RAGES, Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander squat
tdown behind a fender to reload.

<b>ttttS.W.A.T. COMMANDER
</b>ttWell, it doesn't look like they're

</b>ttHere comes one now...

</b>
tMurdoch squints to see who's driving... it's Jason!
tErwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
tside window as the ambulance zooms past.

tMurdoch curses, drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
tthe ambulance.

tThe other COPS join in a moment later, BULLET HITS
tSPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
tthrough the front gate.

tInside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at
tthe cops, then he turns to Jason and says:

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttThat was easy enough...

tErwin looks ahead and screams.

tANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
tdirectly in front of the speeding ambulance, FIRING
tmachine guns.  The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
tducks down.

tTwo cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
tambulance into the middle one just before plowing
tinto the side of the station with a CRASH.

tErwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
tcultist closing in with a gun.  He reaches through the
tsmashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's
tmachine gun laying on the hood.  Erwin turns, SHOOTS
tthe cultist just in time.

tAs Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is
tgreeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him.  Jason RIPS
tOFF the driver's side door and hurls it at the two
tpunks, knocking them down like bowling pins.  Then
tJason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the
tJaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts
ttowards the front door.

</b>ttOnce again... if there be anyone

ttspeak now or forever hold his peace.

tMeagan looks around... no one says anything.  The
treverend clears his throat to continue when...

tWHAM! -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
tin the doorway holding the Jaws of Life.

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttUh, oh...

tThe cultists attack Jason.  Jason grabs the first
tone with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
ta rag doll.  Another attacks with a machete... bad
tidea.  One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
tmachete.  Jason finishes off the last two cultists
tas Erwin barricades the studio door.  The cultists
ton the other side start POUNDING.

tJason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete,
tslicing through a camera cable.  CLOSE ON CABLE as
tit falls to the floor.

tFreddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it
tbehind him.

tErwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy.  He tries to
twake them but can't.  As Jason lumbers over, Erwin
tlooks up and says:

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttI can't wake them up. Freddy's
ttgot them trapped!

tErwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a
tcouple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes.
tErwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
tof dream dope.

tJason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing

tFreddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a
tblow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the
tglove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
tRIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out.

tJason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
taxe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches
tover the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
ther head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling:

<b>ttttBLOODY MARY
</b><b>ttHEY!
</b>
tJason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES
tOFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks
tdown at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD,
tand shrugs:

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttOh, well... I just axed for that!

tFreddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives.
tJason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The
taxe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square
tbetween the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER
tturns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully:

<b>ttttHITLER
</b>ttPeasants...

tDING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going
tinto their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in
this corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post
tstarts in:

<b>ttttHUMAN HEAD
</b>ttThat's it, kiddo! You're really
ttgiving it to him out there! Use the

tFreddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on

tJason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
ta close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
tOFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd
<b>tCHEERS.

tJason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
topening.  Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
tdecapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
tof the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.

tUp in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
tdisgust.

tJason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
thigh above his head.  Then Jason body slams Freddy
tto the mat.  The crowd CHEERS.

tJason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
tFreddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
tcan of spinach.  In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
topens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
tand gulps it down.  Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
this back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
tchest and arms.  At the end of his right hand -- a
theavy metal boxing glove.

tJason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
tmassive glove for a blow.

tCHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
tglove.  Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
tHe bounces off and falls to the mat.  The fans go nuts.

tAs Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
taround and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
tinto a giant mallet.  Jason looks up just in time to
tsee the mallet coming down.  WHAM! -- Freddy drives
tJason into the mat.  The crowd goes wild.

t>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:

</b>ttJason! Get up! Get up!

tANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-

twisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.

tFreddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
tJason struggles but keeps slipping.  This looks like

<b>ttttFREDDY

tMeagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees
tthis and jumps in-between them, yelling:

<b>ttttERWIN
</b>ttNo! Wait!

tMurdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
tthe room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy
trun to his side.

tErwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his

tIn a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
tcultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head.

tturns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.

tMurdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's
thand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason
tjams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and
tpulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor
twith a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We
tsee Murdoch's name written into his shorts.

tAs Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his
thand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
tof his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the
tmuzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks
tthe shotgun and...

tThe cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
tup, "More ammo! More ammo!".

tVARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,
topening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,
tpassing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
tcops in the studio.

tJason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying
toff.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away
tto reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
tof his chest and head.

tFinally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The
tSHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving
tthe cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
tgunsmoke in the room.

tAs it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little,
tthen falls backwards with a mighty THUD.

tJason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason
treaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and
tpulls something out -- Jesse's heart.

tJason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head
trolls back -- he's dead.

tMeagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,
trevealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.

<b>tttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>

</b>
tMeagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the
tRaggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan
tturns out the light, Lizzy asks:

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttYou forgot to check under the bed.

tMeagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed
t-- nada.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttNo monsters here.

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttBut what if they come back?

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttThen we'll just have to kick their
ttass again.

tLizzy giggles.

<b>ttttLIZZY
</b>ttI love you, Meagan.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttI love you too. Go to sleep.


<b>tINT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tAs Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up
tto her from the bottom of the staircase.

<b>ttttMEAGAN'S DAD
</b>ttMeagan?

tMeagan looks down at her parents.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttYes, dad?

<b>ttttMEAGAN'S DAD
</b>ttYour mom and I... well, we want to
ttthank you for saving your sister's

<b>tINT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tMeagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,
twhen the phone RINGS.  She picks it up.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttHello?

<b>ttttFREDDY
</b>ttt(filtered)
ttI'll be seeing you in your dreams...

tFreddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
tlicks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the
tphone down.

<b>ttttMEAGAN
</b>ttt(sighs)
ttI know...

tMeagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.  She
tclimbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
tthe pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.  She smiles
tand puts the pistol back under the pillow.

tFinally, somebody says:
