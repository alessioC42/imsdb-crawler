<b>1tEXT. AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
</b><b>tSHOT - HELICOPTER'S POV - 
</b>
tMoving through clouds.  The clouds separate and, far below, we can
tsee a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND.
tAs we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS
tand PHRASES as though from a public address system.

</b>
<b>ttttBEN
</b>tt- and today it is right that we
ttshould ask ourselves the one most
ttimportant question: What is the
ttpurpose of these years, the purpose
ttfor all this demanding work,
ttthe purpose for the sacrifices
ttmade those who love us?  Were
ttthere NOT a purpose, then all of
ttthese past years of struggle, of
ttfierce competition and of uncom-
ttpromising ambition would be mean-
ttingless.  But, of course, there
ttis a purpose and I must tell it
ttto you.  I ask you to remember
ttthis purpose always and I pledge
ttthat I shall endeavor to carry it
ttwith me forever.

<b>28tINT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN
</b>
tHis eyes are open and he is trying to remember something.
tThere are the SOUNDS of many people TALKING and LAUGHING
tin other rooms.  A RADIO nearby PLAYS MUSIC.  After a
twhile, there is the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING.  The SOUNDS
tof the people TALKING are lower.  MRS. TERHUNE'S voice
tcan be heard among them.

<b>ttttMRS. TERHUNE'S VOICE
</b>
tt-- associate editor of the college
ttnewspaper in his junior year - 
ttmanaging editor in his senior
ttyear -

tThe SOUND of the DOOR CLOSING.  Mrs. Terhune's VOICE and
tthe VOICES of the other guests FADE DOWN.  Mrs. Terhune's
tVOICE can be HEARD with varying clarity through the
tremainder of the sequence.

tAfter a few moments, there is the SOUND of a LIGHT SWITCH
tbeing SNAPPED and light, as though from an overhead fixture,
tfalls across BEN's face.  He does not move.

tAfter a few moments, there is the SOUND of the RADIO being
<b>tSNAPPED OFF.
</b>
<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
</b>ttWhat's the matter?

tBen's mouth opens a little bit and closes again.

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
</b>ttThe guests are all downstairs,
ttBen.  They're all waiting to see you.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttLook, Dad - could you explain to
ttthem that I have to be alone for
tta while?

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
</b>ttThese are all our good friends,
ttBen.  Most of them have known you
ttsince - well - practically since
ttyou were born.

tBen has not moved.  Now the bed on which he is lying moves
tas though someone has sat down upon it next to him.

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
</b>ttWhat is it, Ben?

tThe CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK SLOWLY.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm just - 

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>tt- worried?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell - 

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttAbout what?

ttttBen
ttI guess - about my future.

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttWhat about it?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI don't know.  I want it to be -

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttTo be what?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttDifferent.

tAs Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and
tMRS. BRADDOCK looks in.

<b>ttttMRS. BRADDOCK
</b>ttIs anything wrong?

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttNo!  No - we're just on our way
ttdownstairs!

tMr. Braddock gets off the bed and goes to a chair and
tpicks up Ben's jacket which is lying across it.

<b>ttttMRS. BRADDOCK
</b>ttThe Carlsons' are here.

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttt(to Mrs. Braddock)
ttThey are?
ttt(to Ben)
ttCome on.

tMr. Braddock puts the jacket on Ben.

<b>ttttMRS. BRADDOCK
</b>ttThey came all the way from
ttTarzana.

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttIt's a wonderful thing to have
ttso many devoted friends.

tThey move out of the door, Mr. Braddock steering Ben.

<b>29tINT. HALLS AND STAIRWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tPHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the
tBraddocks are moving down.

<b>ttttMR. CARLSON
</b>ttHey - there's our award winning
ttscholar.

<b>ttttMRS. CARLSON
</b>ttWe're all very proud of you,

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThank you, Mrs. Carlson.

<b>ttttMR. CARLSON
</b>ttIs that the new car out there?
ttThe little red Wop job?

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttThat's Ben's graduation present.

<b>ttttMR. CARLSON
</b>ttt(putting his arm
tttacross Ben's shoulder)
ttWon't have much trouble picking
ttthem up in that, will you?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSir?

<b>ttttMR. CARLSON
</b>ttThe girls.  The chicks.  The -
ttthe teeny boppers.

<b>ttttMRS. CARLSON
</b>ttI think Ben has gotten beyond
ttthe teeny bopper stage - haven't
ttyou, Ben?

tMrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink.  Ben tries to smile
tand return the wink politely.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes, ma'am.

tThey reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttExcuse me - I think I'd just
ttlike to check something on
ttthe car for a minute -

tBen moves to the front door and opens it.  MR. LOOMIS
tsteps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.

<b>ttttMR. LOOMIS
</b>ttHere's the track star himself.
ttHow are you, track star?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttJust fine, Mr. Loomis.

tMr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the
thall.

<b>ttttMR. LOOMIS
</b>ttI want to get a drink and then
ttI want to hear all about that
ttthing you won.  That Hopperman
ttaward.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHelpingham.

<b>ttttMR. LOOMIS
</b>ttHelpingham!  Right!  Now you
ttwait right here.

tMr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben
tmoves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of
tthe living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another
tlady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket.

<b>ttttLADY 1
</b>ttBen - we're all so proud of
ttyou.

<b>ttttLADY 2
</b>ttProud, proud, proud, proud,

<b>ttttLADY 3
</b>ttWhat are you going to do now?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI was going to go upstairs for a
ttminute -

<b>ttttLADY 3
</b>ttNo - I meant with your future.

<b>ttttLADY 2
</b>ttWith your life.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell - that's a little hard to say -

tMR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben.

<b>ttttMR. MCQUIRE
</b>ttBen!

ttttBen

ttt(he turns around)
ttMr. McQuire

<b>ttttMR. MCQUIRE

ttBen.

<b>ttttBEN

tMr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall
ttoward the back of the house and out through the back door.

<b>30tEXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT
</b>
tThe pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and
tTALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard.

<b>ttttMR. MCQUIRE
</b>ttBen - I just want to say one word to
ttyou - just one word -

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes, sir.

<b>ttttMR. MCQUIRE
</b>ttAre you listening?

ttPlastics.

tThey look at each other for a moment.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttExactly how do you mean?

<b>ttttMR. MCQUIRE
</b>ttThere is a great future in plastics.
ttThink about it.  Will you think
ttabout it?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes, I will.

<b>ttttMR. MCQUIRE
</b>ttOkay.  Enough said.  That's a deal.

tMr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The
tpeople at the other end of the yard look toward Ben.

<b>ttttWOMAN #1
</b>ttHere he is now.  Here's Ben.

<b>ttttBEN

<b>ttttBEN

tThey stand for a moment, loocking at each other.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttHow are you, Benjamin?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttFine, thank you.  The bathroom is
ttdown at the end of the hall.

tMrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge
tof the bed.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttLook, Mrs. Robinson, I don't
ttmean to be rude but -

tMrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and
tlights it.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttIs there an ashtray in here?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo.
<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttOh - I forgot.  The track star
ttdoesn't smoke.

tShe blows out the match and puts it down carefully on
tthe bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over
tto the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the
twastebasket.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttIs it a girl?

<b>ttttBEN

tMrs. Robinson looks at him.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON

tBen turns and walks down the hall.  They enter sunroom.

tShe pours herself a drink.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDrink?

tShe hands him a drink.  There is a pause.

</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell, why can't you just lock
ttthe doors and go to bed?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI'm very nuerotic.

tShe turns on the phonograph.  SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttMay I ask you a question?

tBen looks at her.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhat do you think of me?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttYou've known me nearly all of
ttyour life.  You must have
ttformed some opinion.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell - I've always thought
ttthat you were a very - nice -
ttperson.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDid you know I was an alcoholic?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDid you know that?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttLook - I think I should be
ttgoing -

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttSit down, Benjamin.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttMrs. Robinson - if you don't
ttmind my saying so - this

ttthat Mr. Robinson will be here
ttany minute and -

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttMy husband will be back quite
ttlate.

tThey look at each other.  Ben is half standing.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttHe should be gone for several
tthours.

tShe takes a step toward him.  He puts his hand up and
tretreats around the other side of the chair.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh my God.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttPardon?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhat's wrong?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttMrs. Robinson, you didn't -
ttI mean you didn't expect -

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI mean - you didn't really
ttthink that I would do something
ttlike that.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttLike what?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat do you think?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWell I don't know.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttFor God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,
tthere we are, you've got me into
ttyour house.  You give me a
ttdrink.  You put on music, now
ttyou start opening up your
ttpersonal life to me and tell
ttme your husband won't be home
ttfor hours.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttSo?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttMrs. Robinson - you are trying
ttto seduce me.

tThere is a pause.  She looks at him.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(weaker)
ttAren't you?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhy no.  I hadn't thought of it.
ttI feel rather flattered that
ttyou -

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttMrs. Robinson, will you forgive
ttme for what I just said?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttIt's all right.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttIt's not all right, it's the
ttworst thing I've ever said
ttto anyone.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttSit down.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttPlease forgive me.  Because I
ttlike you.  I don't think of you
ttthat way.  But I'm mixed up.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttAll right.  Now finish your drink.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttMrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
ttthat I said that to you.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWe'll forget it right now.
ttFinish your drink.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat is wrong with me?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttHave you ever seen Elaine's
ttportrait?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHer portrait?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWe had it done last Christmas.
ttWould you like to see it?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttVery much.

tWe move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom,
tinto the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to
tthe doorway to Elaine's room.

</b>
tBen moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttElaine certainly is an

tIn the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(looking at the
tttportrait)
ttI don't remember her as having
ttbrown eyes.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBenjamin?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWill you unzip my dress?

tHe steps back.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI think I'll go to bed.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh.  Well, goodnight.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWon't you unzip my dress?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttIf you still think I'm trying
ttto seduce you -

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo, I don't.  But I just feel
tta little funny.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBenjamin - you've known me all

tBen reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThank you.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttRight.

tBen walks toward the door.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhat are you so scared of?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThen why do you keep running
ttaway?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBecause you're going to bed.  I
ttdon't think I should be up here.

tMrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.

</b>ttHaven't you ever seen anybody
ttin a slip before?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes, I have -

tHe looks up at the portrait of Elaine.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut I just - Look - what if Mr.
ttRobinson walked in right now?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhat if he did?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell, it would look pretty
ttfunny, wouldn't it?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDon't you think he trusts us
tttogether?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOf course he does.  But he
ttmight get the wrong idea.
ttAnyone might.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI don't see why.  I'm twice as

ttanyone think -

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut they would!  Don't you see?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBenjamin - I'm not trying to
ttseduce you.  I wish you'd -

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI know that.  But please, Mrs.
ttRobinson.  This is difficult
ttfor me.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhy is it?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBecause I am confused about
ttthings.  I can't tell what
ttI'm imagining.  I can't tell
ttwhat's real.  I can't -

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWould you like me to seduce you?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttIs that what you're trying to

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm going home now.  I apologize
ttfor what I said.  I hope you can

ttright now.

tBenjamin walks out of the door and down the hall.  The
tCAMERA PUSHES with him to the door.  We see the entire
tstairway and part of the downstairs hall.  Ben gets to
tthe stairs and starts down.

tShe is holding her dress in front of her.

</b>ttWhere is it?

</b>ttOn that chair in the hall.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>ttI'm in the bathroom.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell here's the purse.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>ttBenjamin - I am getting pretty

ttNow if you won't do me a simple

tBen appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm putting it on the top step.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>ttFor God's sake, Benjamin, will
ttyou stop acting that way and

tBen gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly
tdown the hall.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm putting it here by the door.

</b>ttWill you bring it in to me?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttRight.

<b>38tINT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tBen walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the
tbed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn
tback, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a
tmovement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He
tturns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the
tdoor to the bedroom behind her.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh God.

tShe smiles.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttLet me out.

tShe turns the lock on the door.

</b>ttYes.  Yes.  Let me out!

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBecause I find you very attractive

tThere is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside.
tBen leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside,
tstruggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into
tthe hall and down the stairs.

<b>39tINT. SUNROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tBen rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of

tthe glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
tSOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING.

<b>ttttMR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>ttIs that Ben's car in front?

<b>ttttBEN

tMr. Robinson takes the glass from him.

</b>ttCome on.  Let's have a nightcap
tttogether.

tMr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks.
tBen takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie
tand checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson
tturns and brings him the drink.

</b>ttThank you very much, sir.

</b>ttSow a few wild oats.  Take things

tMrs. Robinson enters the room.  She is now wearing the

</b>ttDon't get up.

tBen sits.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>42tEXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
</b>
tThe sun shines brightly.  Standing and sitting around
tthe pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR.
tand MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and
tLOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the
tfence on one side of the house: the young girl from next
tdoor and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other
tside of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed
tas though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch-
ting.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the
tArnolds and their children are dressed in California
tContemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely
ttoo young for them, the children in styles infinitely too
told for them.

tMr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the
thouse.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the other
tend.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttHey, over there -- I mean you!
ttYour attention please!

tMr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the
thouse, the window into the kitchen.  He speaks quickly -
tin a fake sotto voce - towards the window.

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttAre you ready in there, feature
ttattraction?

<b>ttttBEN'S VOICE
</b>ttCould I speak to you for a second,

tBut Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window
tand is readdressing his audience.

</b>tt- what was I saying?

</b>ttFeature attraction.

</b>ttJust hang on a minute because

</b>ttYou always do.

tThey laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as
the grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy
tcomeback.

</b>ttDad - could we just talk about
ttthis for a second?

tMr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open.
tIt slams against the wall inside.

</b>tt- Benjamin Braddock!

tAt the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben,
tdressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers
ton his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the
tmask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling.
tHe holds a spear gun in his hand.

tThe people applaud.

</b>ttFolks - this remarkable young
ttman is going to perform for you
ttsome spectacular and amazing
ttfeats of daring in water that is
ttover six feet deep -

tBen's arms come into view and pull the mask down.

tWe are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD
tdown the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through
tthe glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing
tapparatus in it.

tSOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
tSOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
tapplauding and chattering noiselessly.

tWe MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock
tis running back and forth, clapping his hands and
tdelivering his now soundless pitch.

tWe MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
tpool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,
tmotioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He
tjoins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both
tbegin to motion us toward them.

tWe get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals
tus with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge
tof the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
tunder.  He has a big smile.

tWe SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The
tfigures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
tof Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
tthe neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their
tfences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding
tencouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees,
tsmiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
tunder.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.

tUntil there are thirty houses below us, with its owners,

tIn a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of

tthe receiver to his ear.  SOUND of PHONE RINGING.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>ttI'll be there in an hour.

tSOUND of her HANGING UP.  Ben hangs up slowly.
tHe stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about
tuncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and
tcarrying it folded across his arm in front of him,
tleaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that
tlead to the main lobby.  As he is about to go in, the
tdoors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming
tout, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering
tto each other and helping each other out of the door and
tdown the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them
tand stands politely to one side.  As they get through,
tBen starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG
tPEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push
thim to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He
tmoves back against the other door, holding it open and
tallowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and they
tpay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the
tlobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with
tthem.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in
tand says something to the CLERK behind the desk.

tThe clerk points across the lobby and says something to
thim.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-
twhere.  The group of young people passes by the desk
tand Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and
tlooks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against
tthe wall with the room numbers painted under them and the
tkeys dangling suggestively.

<b>ttttROOM CLERK
</b>ttCan I help you, sir!

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat?  Oh - no - I'm just -

tHe points vaguely in the direction of the other young
tpeople.

<b>ttttROOM CLERK
</b>ttAre you here for an affair,

tTerror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes.  He looks
thelplessly at the clerk.

</b>ttWhat?

</b>ttThe Singleman party, sir?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh - yes.  The Singleman party.

<b>ttttROOM CLERK
</b>ttIt's in the main ballroom.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttAhh - thank you.

tBen backs off and turns and starts across the lobby.
tHe puts on his jacket as he goes.  He gets to the entrance
tto the main ballroom.  He pauses at the door, looks in.

tWhat he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc.
tHe turns back toward te lobby.  He stops.

tWhat he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching
thim.

tBen flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom

</b>ttWell why do you - why do you
ttthink that?

<b>ttttMRS. BRADDOCK
</b>ttBecause I know you don't drive
ttaround for twelve hours.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh.  Well, I don't.  Shall I
tttell you what I do?

<b>ttttMRS. BRADDOCK
</b>ttNot if you don't want to.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI do.

<b>ttttMRS. BRADDOCK
</b>ttBut I don't want you to make
ttup something.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm not.  But I'm - I'm not very
ttproud of what I do.  I usually
ttget kind of drunk.  I usually
ttdrive over to Los Angeles and
ttgo to some bars and get kind of
ttdrunk.  Then I take a hotel
ttroom.  So I won't have to drive
tthome on the freeway.  I mean it
ttkind of scares me to drive home
ttafter -

</b>ttWait a minute.
ttt(he pushes her

ttSit down a minute.

tMrs. Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows.

</b>ttWill you please sit down a

tMrs. Robinson walks to the bed and sits.  She reaches
tdown to take off a shoe.

</b>ttWill you leave that shoe on for

tShe straightens up.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNow - do you think we could say

ttthis time?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttIf you want.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttGood.  I mean are we dead or

</b>ttWell I just don't think we have

</b>ttAnything.  Anything at all.

tShe reaches for her shoe.

</b>ttLeave it on!  Now we are going to
ttdo this thing.  We are going to
tthave a conversation.  Think of
ttanother topic.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttHow about art.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttArt.  That's a good subject.
ttYou start it off.

</b>ttYou start it off.  I don't know

</b>ttOh.

</b>ttDon't you?

</b>ttYes I do.  I know quite a bit

</b>ttArt.  Well what do you want to
ttknow about it.

tShe shrugs.

</b>ttI don't.

tBen nods and looks at the rug.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttCan I take off my clothes now?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo.  Think of another topic.
ttTell me what you did today.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDo you really want me to?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes I do.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI got up.

tBen starts shaking his head.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDo you want to hear it or not?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes.  But you might try and spice
ttit up with a little originality.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI got up.  I ate breakfast and
ttwent shopping.  During the after-
ttnoon I read a novel.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat one.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat novel did you read.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI don't remember.

</b>ttThen I fixed supper for my husband
ttand waited until -

</b>ttThere!

</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYour husband!  Mrs. Robinson!
ttThere's something we could have
tta conversation about.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttHim?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI mean everything.  I don't know
ttanything about how you - how you
ttwork this.  I don't know how you
ttget out of the house at night.  I
ttdon't know the risk involved.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThere isn't any.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThere's no risk?

tShe shakes her head.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHow do you get out of the house?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI walk out.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou walk right out the door.

tShe nods.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat do you say to him?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttHe's asleep.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttAlways?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBenjamin, this isn't a very
ttinteresting topic.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttPlease.  Now tell me.  How do
ttyou know he won't wake up
ttsometime and follow you.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBecause he takes sleeping pills.
ttHe takes three sleeping pills
ttevery night at ten o'clock.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut what about the noise from
ttthe car.  What if -

</b>ttThe driveway's on my side of

</b>ttt(smiling)
ttWe're talking.

</b>ttWe're talking, Mrs. Robinson.
ttWe're talking.

</b>ttCalm down, Benjamin.

</b>ttNow let's keep going here.

</b>ttCan I undress and talk at the
ttsame time?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThank you.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNow.  You say the driveway's on
ttyour side of the house.  So I
ttguess you don't sleep in the
ttsame room.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWe don't.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSo you don't - I mean I don't
ttlike to seem like I'm prying
ttbut I guess you don't sleep
tttogether or anything.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttNo we don't.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell how long has this been going
tton.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttt(looking at the
tttceiling for a moment)
ttAbout five years.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh no.  Are you kidding me?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou have not slept with your
tthusband for five years?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttNow and then.  He geats drunk a
ttfew times a year.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHow many times a year.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttOn New Year's Eve.  Sometimes on
tthis birthday.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttMan, is this interesting.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttIs it?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSo you don't love him.  You
ttwouldn't say you -

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWe've talked enough, Benjamin.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWait a minute.  So you wouldn't
ttsay you loved him.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttNot exactly.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut you don't hate him.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttNo, Benjamin.  I don't hate him.
ttUnhook my blouse.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(unhooking her blouse)
ttWell how do you feel about him,
ttthen?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI don't.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell that's kind of a bad
ttsituation then, isn't it?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttIs it?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI mean it doesn't sound like it
ttcould be much worse.  If you
tthated him at least you'd hate
tthim.

tShe nods and takes off her blouse.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell you loved him once, I
ttassume.  When you first knew
tthim.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI never did, Benjamin.  Now
ttlet's -

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell, wait a minute.  You married
tthim.

tShe nods.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhy did you do that?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttt(taking off her
tttstockings)
ttSee if you can guess.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell I can't.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThink real hard, Benjamin.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI can't see why you did, unless
tt...you didn't have to marry him
ttor anything, did you?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDon't tell Elaine.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh no.  You had to marry him
ttbecause you got pregnant?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttAre you shocked?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell I never thought of you and
ttMr. Robinson as the kind of
ttpeople who...

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttAll right.  Now let's get to bed.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWait a minute.  Wait a minute.
ttSo how did it happen?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI mean do you feel like telling
ttme what were the circumstances?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttNot particularly.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWas he a law student at the time?

tShe nods.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttAnd you were a student also.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttAt college.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat was your major?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhy are you asking me all this?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBecause I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.
ttNow what was your major subject
ttat college?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttArt.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttArt?

tShe nods.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut I thought you - I guess you
ttkind of lost interest in it over
ttthe years then.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttKind of.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell how did it happen?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttHow do you think.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI mean did he take you up to
tthis room with him?  Did you go
ttto a hotel?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBenjamin, what does it possibly
ttmatter?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm curious.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWe'd go to his car.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh no.  In the car you did it?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI don't think we were the first.

tBen thinks for a moment.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat kind of car was it?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttDo you remember the make of the
ttcar?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttOh my God.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttReally.  I want to know.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttIt was a Ford, Benjamin.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(jumping up)
ttA Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a
ttFord!  That's great!

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThat's enough.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSo old Elaine Robinson got started
ttin a Ford.

tThere is a pause.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDon't talk about Elaine.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttDon't talk about Elaine?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhy not?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBecause I don't want you to.

tShe walks to the bed.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell why don't you?

tShe pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his
tjacket.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI wish you'd tell me.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThere's nothing to tell.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell why is she a big taboo
ttsubject all of a sudden?

tMrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell - I guess I'll have to ask
tther out on a date and find out
ttwhat's --

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBenjamin, don't you ever take
ttthat girl out.

tBen looks at her.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDo you understand that?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell look.  I have no intention
ttof taking her out.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttGood.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI was just kidding around.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttGood.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut why shouldn't I?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI have my reasons.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThen let's hear them.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttLet's hear your reasons, Mrs.
ttRobinson.  Because I think I
ttknow what they are.

tShe pulls the covers down.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm not good enough for her to
ttassociate with, am I?  I'm not
ttgood enough to even talk about
tther, am I?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttLet's drop it.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWe're not dropping it.  Now
ttthat's the reason, isn't it?
ttI'm a dirty degenerate, aren't
ttI?  I'm not fit to -

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBenjamin?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI'm good enough for you but I'm
tttoo slimy to associate with
ttyour daughter.  That's it, isn't
ttit?  ISN'T IT?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou go to hell.  You go straight
ttto hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you
ttthink I'm proud of myself?  Do
ttyou think I'm proud of this?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI wouldn't know.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell, I'm not.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttYou're not.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo sir.  I am not proud that I
ttspend my time with a broken-
ttdown alcoholic!

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI see.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttAnd if you think I come here
ttfor any reason besides pure
ttboredom, then you're all wrong.

tShe nods.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBecause - Mrs. Robinson this
ttis the sickest, most perverted
ttthing that ever happened to
ttme.  And you do what you want
ttbut I'm getting the hell out.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttAre you?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou're goddamn right I am.

tHe starts putting on his shirt.  She sits on the edge of
tthe bed and watches him.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThat's how you feel about me.

tHe nods.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThat I'm a sick and disgusting
ttperson.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNow don't start this.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttDon't start acting hurt.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDon't you expect me to be a
ttlittle hurt?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttMrs. Robinson, you stand there
ttand tell me I'm not good enough
ttfor your daughter.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttDid I say that?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOf course you did.

tShe shakes her head.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBenjamin, I want to apologize
ttto you if that's the impression
ttyou got.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell two minutes ago you told
ttme I wasn't good enough for
ttyour daughter.  Now you say
ttyou're sorry I got that
ttimpression.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttI didn't mean it.  I don't think
ttyou'd be right for each other.
ttBut I would never say you
ttweren't as good a person as
ttshe is.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou wouldn't.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttOf course I wouldn't.

tMrs. Robinson walks to the closet.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhat are you doing?

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttWell it's pretty obvious you
ttdon't want me around any more.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell look - I was kind of upset
ttthere.  I'm sorry I said those
ttthings.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttIf that's how you feel -

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut it's not.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttt(smiling at him)
ttThat's all right.  I think I
ttcan understand why I'm disgusting
ttto you.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh no.  Look - I like you.  I
ttwouldn't keep coming here if
ttI didn't like you.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBut if it's sickening for you -

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttIt's not!  I enjoy it!  I look
ttforward to it.  It's the one
ttthing I have to look forward
ttto.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttYou don't have to say that.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell I wouldn't.  I would never
ttsay it if it wasn't true.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttMay I stay then?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYes. Please.  I want you to.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThank you.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWell don't thank me, because I
ttwant you to.

tThere is a long pause.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttBut you won't ever take out
ttElaine, will you?  I want you
ttto promise me that.

tThere is another long pause.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttLook.  Why the hell did you
ttbring this up.  It never
ttoccured to me to take her out.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttThen give me your word you won't.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThis is absurd.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON
</b>ttPromise me, Benjamin.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttAll right, for christ's sake.
ttI promise I will never take
ttout Elaine Robinson.

<b>ttttMRS. ROBINSON

ttBenjamin -

tAt opposite sides of the room, without looking at each

tat the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock
tare there.

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttElaine's back from school.  I
ttthink it might be a nice gesture
ttif you asked her out.

tBenjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues
teating and reading.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

tBen is lying on his bed.  Mrs. Braddock stands in the
tdoorway.

<b>ttttMRS. BRADDOCK
</b>ttDon't you think that she's a
ttterribly attractive girl?
ttBecause I think she's one of

</b>
tBen is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the
tBraddock pool.  The sun shines down.  His diving mask
tis on over his eyes.  His face is in the water, looking
tdown at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock,
tin their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around
tBen.  During the entire conversation they continue to
tswim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep
ttheir heads above the surface.

<b>ttttMRS. BRADDOCK
</b>ttIt's pretty embarrassing.  I
ttreally don't know what to tell
ttMr. Robinson.  It's ackward
ttand strained for me every time
tthe suggests that you call up
ttElaine.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNext time he suggests it,
ttI'll tell him I have no
ttintention of ever calling
tther up in my life.

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttI guess she's not good enough
ttfor you, is that it?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttLook - Elaine Robinson and I
ttdo not get along.

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttHow do you know?  You haven't
ttseen her since high school.  I

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThat has nothing to do with it -

<b>ttttMR. BRADDOCK
</b>ttI guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson
ttthat you're just too busy every

<b>ttttMRS. BRADDOCK
</b>ttDon't go on like this.  Now if
ttBenjamin absolutely refuses to

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI do.

<b>ttttMRS. BRADDOCK
</b>tt- then I'll simply invite all the

tthe three Robinsons and the three Braddocks.  Elaine's
tback is to us.  Ben is at the other end of the table,
tfacing us.  The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along
tthe sides.  Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is
teating, looking down at their places.  After a few moments
tBen throws his head back ans starts to scream.  As he
tcontinues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs.
tRobinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up.
