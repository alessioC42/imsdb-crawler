<b>                          EARLY DRAFT
</b>







tOut of BLACK we hear the sound of an airplane roaring by.

<b>tEXT.  POV OF AN AIRPLANE
</b>
tFlying over American heartland.  We see the earth through the
tpilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the
tplane swooping down and storming over the ground.

<b>tTHE PLANE
</b>
tis a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants.  It
treleases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again...

tUp into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like
thoney over family farms stretching to the horizon.  Maybe
tit's not heaven, maybe it's just Tennessee.  But as long as
tthere's been an America, men have fought and died for this
tplace -- as volunteers.

tFar off, but visible from the plane is

<b>tA BARN - DAY
</b>
tThe barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says
t"McCawley Crop Dusting." Another plane noise, this one made
tby kids, brings us to TWO BOYS, sitting in the shell of an
told plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats,
tand wheels.

tThe boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg
tthey've replaced the seat with.  They've even attached a 2x4
tas propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help.  They
twear overalls and have bowl haircuts:  RAFE and DANNY, 10
tyears old.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttBandits at 2 o'clock.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttPower dive!

tThey buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls,
tRafe's bare feet on one pedal, Danny's on the other.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttIt's Germans!

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttKill the bastards!

tRafe looks at Danny in shock -- then they both laugh and go
tright back into their game, manufacturing their own machine
tgun and engine sounds.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttGood shooting, Danny!

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttGood shooting, Rafe!

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttLand of the free...

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttHome of the brave!

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttThere's another one!

tTheir vocal motors roar again... But a man's hand grabs Danny
tby the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit.

tIt's Danny's FATHER and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his
thair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth -- those still
tleft -- are rotting.  He's also missing an arm; but the one
tthat's left is potent, and he's shaking Danny with it.

<b>tttttDANNY'S FATHER
</b>tttYou no count boy!  Johnson come lookin',
tttsaid he'd pay a dime for you to shovel
ttthis pig shed, and I can't find you no
tttplace.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttDaddy, I told you I was comin' here.

tHis father slaps him off his feet.  Rafe is so horrified he
tcan't get a sound out.  Danny isn't even surprised.  But when
this father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps
tso tight they choke him, he struggles.  It does no good; his
tfather starts marching across the field, dragging and
tstrangling Danny.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttDa!... Dad...

tThe father's drunken anger makes him oblivious -- until
tCRACK!  The 2x4 propeller slams him across the back, knocking
thim to the ground and making him drop Danny.

tThe father rolls over to see 10-year-old Rafe, holding the
t2x4 like a bat.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttLet him alone!

tThe father's eyes bulge in rage; he struggles to his feet.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttRafe... Daddy... No!

tThe man looks murderous, but Rafe draws back the board.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI'll bust you open, you...German!

tThe words ring something deep in the man's booze-broken
tbrain.  He begins to cough, convulsively; it brings a blossom
tof blood to his mouth.  He wipes it with his hand, but blood
tclings to his teeth.  He chokes out --

<b>tttttDANNY'S FATHER
</b>tttI fought the Germans.

tHe looks at Danny in shame, with the realization of what he's
tjust done.  He turns and staggers away.

tDanny looks at Rafe -- a communication between boys joined by
tsomething deeper than blood.  Then Danny runs off after his
tfather.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttDaddy!  Daddy!  Wait.

tDanny catches him, takes his father's hand, and walks away
twith him.

tThe crop duster we saw in the air has just landed, behind
tRafe.  The pilot, RAFE'S FATHER, shuts off the engine.

<b>tttttRAFE'S FATHER
</b>tttWhat's goin' on, son?

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttNothing.  Danny's Dad just come to get
ttthim.

tRafe turns back to the ramshackle plane and replaces the 2x4
tpropeller.  His father looks toward Danny and his father,
twalking away, then looks at his own son.

<b>tttttRAFE'S FATHER
</b>tttHey, boy -- you wanna go up?

tRafe can't believe it; he runs to the plane and hops into his
tfather's lap.  As his father cranks the engine and tucks him
tinto the harness, Rafe says --

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttDaddy, sometime will you take Danny up
ttttoo?

<b>tttttRAFE'S FATHER
</b>tttSure will, son.

tThe engine races to life...and we --

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT.  NEW JERSEY AIR BASE - DAY
</b>
tAmerican P-40 fighters blast through the air, props screaming
tand wind singing by their wings.

tThere are eight pilots in their individual seats, and we
tfocus on two:  RAFE MCCAWLEY has grown lean and handsome.
tAnd DANNY WALKER is very much the same.

tTheir planes start swapping positions in the formation; while
tthe other guys are flying along in a tight line, Rafe and
tDanny are playing, one of them gunning his engine to go high,
tthe other diving and coming back up in his place,
tleapfrogging.

tIt scares the other guys, having their planes flashing in and
tout, so close.  The TRAINING CAPTAIN, watching through
tbinoculars on the ground, talks into his RADIO --

<b>tttttTRAINING CAPTAIN
</b>tttMcCawley!  Walker!  Cut that out!

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI thought this was a training flight.
tttI'm just trying to give Danny some
ttttraining.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttNot on your best day, boy!

tRafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction
the was moving before.  Danny reacts almost instantly...
tleapfrogging in the opposite direction, scaring the piss out
tof everybody else.

<b>tttttTRAINING CAPTAIN
</b>tttThat's it, get into a wedge!

tThe squadron responds, forming up into a tight V, Rafe and
tDanny just behind and on either side of the center.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttDidn't you say test the limits?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttHey, you wanna test my limits, you better
tttline up a couple dozen women on the
tttGROUND...cause I got NO limits in the
tttair!

tRafe grins, loving the challenge.  Then he and Danny do the
tleapfrogging maneuver laterally, swapping sides in the V.

<b>tttttTRAINING CAPTAIN
</b>tttEverybody down!

<b>tEXT.  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - DAY
</b>
tThe planes land in tight order and taxi off the runway; shut
tdown their props, slide back the canopies and hop down.  We
tsee young pilots we'll get to know:  ANTHONY, BILLY, RED.

<b>tttttTRAINING CAPTAIN
</b>tttWhere are McCawley and Walker?

<b>tEXT.  RAFE AND DANNY - STILL IN THE AIR - DAY
</b>
tThey've circled to opposite ends of the airfield and are now
theading right at each other, like two bullets playing
tchicken.

<b>tttttTRAINING CAPTAIN
</b>tttAw shit...

<b>tINT.  THE COCKPITS
</b>
tFrom Rafe and Danny's POV, the rush is awesome.

tTHE PILOTS ON THE GROUND watch in awe as the P-40's get so
tclose they can't possibly get out of each other's way.
tBilly, the most boyish-faced of the pilots, yells to drown
tout the sound of the collision...

tAt the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that
ttheir wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other
tbelly to belly.

<b>tIN THE COCKPITS
</b>
tRafe and Danny burst out laughing.

<b>tTHE PILOTS ON THE GROUND
</b>
tlaugh and congratulate each other.

<b>tttttTRAINING CAPTAIN
</b>tttYou know what they say... You can take the
tttcrop duster out of the country -- but
tttdon't put him in a P-40.

tRafe banks to land, and Danny tucks in behind him.  Danny has
tRafe's plane in his sights.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttIf I had guns I'd be chewing up your --

tRafe feints left, banks right, and appears behind Danny.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttIf you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em.

tThey're almost to the landing strip, Rafe behind Danny.  But
tas Danny's wheels are about to touch, he guns his engine and
tsnaps the nose of his plane straight up.

tTHE OTHER PILOTS stop laughing.

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttHe's doing an inside loop!

<b>tttttTRAINING CAPTAIN
</b>tttAw, shit...

tDanny pulls it off, just barely making a full circle to come
tin behind Rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYee-hawww!!!

tDanny taxis his plane over to join the others.  He's grinning
tas he slides back his cockpit cover; then --

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttWhere's Rafe?

tRed, tall with flaming orange hair, tips his chin toward the
tair.  Seeing Rafe's plane still in the air, Danny starts to
trefasten his harness.

<b>tttttTRAINING CAPTAIN
</b>tttYou're down, Walker!  That's an order!

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttWhat about him?

<b>tttttTRAINING CAPTAIN
</b>tttHe's not taking my orders anymore.

tDanny's just about to ask what the hell that means, when he
tnotices Rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttHe's gonna do it.

<b>tttttBILLY
</b>tttDo what?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttIt.
tttt(beat)
tttAw, shit.  Aw shit shit shit...

tRAFE'S PLANE reaches two thousand feet, just a speck above
tthem, and seems to pause in the air.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttI shouldn't'a done an inside loop.
tttI shouldn't'a done an inside loop.

<b>tttttBILLY
</b>tttWhy?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttCause now he's gonna do an outside loop.

<b>tttttTRAINING CAPTAIN
</b>tttAw shit.  Aw shit shit shit...

tAnthony and Billy join in, like an involuntary chant --

<b>tttttANTHONY & BILLY
</b>tttAw shit shit shit...

tRAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT, is tightly controlled, yet serene.  He
tnoses the plane into a power dive.

tThe P-40 screams toward the ground, picking up speed, going
tso fast it begins to shudder.

tTHE OTHER PILOTS are transfixed.  Red is so nervous he can't
tget the words out.

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttAw sh- sh- sh- sh-

<b>tttttBILLY
</b>tttShit.

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttYeah.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYou can do it, Rafe.  You can do it.

tThe P-40, hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed,
tsnaps into a half roll, streaking upside down over the
trunway.  Rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the
tasphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his
thead.

tHe pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outside
tof the circle.  The plane reaches the top of its arc, and
talmost stalls; but Rafe noses it over again, toward the
tearth, only this time he has very little altitude.  The plane
thurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the
tcurve...

tAnd makes it full circle.  Rafe's head now is barely a foot
toff the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted.

tTHE OTHER PILOTS burst into cheers.

tRAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT permits himself a smile.

tHe lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except for
tthe Training Captain, who stands there shaking his head.

tDanny jumps on the wing, as Rafe stops and slides back his
tcanopy.  Danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYou could've killed yourself, you stupid
tttbastard!

tHe dives into the cockpit, hugging Rafe.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttThat was the most beautiful thing I ever
tttsaw.

<b>tINT.  COLONEL DOOLITTLE'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tCOLONEL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, mid-forties, is commander of the
tbase.  He's as tough as he is good in the air.  And right now
the's frowning at Rafe McCawley, standing at attention before
thim.

<b>tttttDOOLITTLE
</b>tttThere are some people who think the
tttoutside loop is reckless and
tttirresponsible.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttHow could it be irresponsible, Sir, if
tttyou were the first man in the world to do
tttit?

<b>tttttDOOLITTLE
</b>tttDon't get smart with me, son.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttNever, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous
tttonly for the kind of pilot who wants to
tttshow off, rather than inspire the other
tttpilots in his unit.  And all you've done
tttfor me, Sir, working out the transfer, I
tttdid it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir.
tttWhat the French call a "homage."

<b>tttttDOOLITTLE
</b>tttThat's bullshit, son.  But it's really
tttgood bullshit.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttThank you, Sir.

tDoolittle stands, moves around his desk, and shakes Rafe's
thand.

<b>tttttDOOLITTLE
</b>tttGood luck over there McCawley.  I admire
tttyour decision.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttThank you, Sir.

<b>tINT.  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - BARRACKS - NIGHT
</b>
tThe pilots are getting slicked up for a night on the town.
tDanny's at the mirrors with the others; he's putting on
tcologne, and looks terrific in his uniform.

tAnthony and Billy are combing their hair at the sinks.  Billy
tdeclares to his image in the mirror --

<b>tttttBILLY
</b>tttYou good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you
tttEVER die!

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttThat's your line for tonight, ya know.

<b>tttttBILLY
</b>tttWhat, good-lookin' sumbitch?

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttNo, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse
tttalone, you look her in the eye, and say,
ttt"Baby, they're training me for war, and I
tttdon't know what'll happen.  But if I die
ttttomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all
tttwe could tonight."  I've never known it
tttto fail.

tRed finishes brushing his teeth at the sink beside them.

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttHe's n-never known it to work, either.

tThe guys head out laughing, running into Rafe coming in.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttDoolittle didn't kill you?  Attaboy!

tRafe catches Danny's arm.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttDanny, there's something I gotta tell
tttyou...

<b>tEXT.  NEW JERSEY BARRACKS - NIGHT
</b>
tRafe and Danny are walking on the parade ground; the other
tguys are already on the bus that will take them into town.
tDanny's upset by what Rafe just told him.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttHow could you do this?

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttThe Colonel helped me work it out.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttI don't mean how'd you do the paperwork,
tttI mean how the hell did you do it without
tttletting me in on it?

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI'm sorry, Danny, but they're only
tttaccepting the best pilots.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttDon't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're
ttttalking about war, and I know what war
tttdoes to people.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttDanny, you know how many times I saw you
tttcome to school with a black eye or a
tttbusted nose, and couldn't do a thing
tttabout it -- for you, or for your mother...
tttor your father, with his lungs scorched
tttout with mustard gas, and more left of
ttthis lungs than there was of his spirit?
tttYou've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's
ttttime I made mine.

<b>tttttBILLY
</b>tttt(from the bus)
tttThe nurses are waiting!

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttLet's go.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttNah, you go on.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you
tttto meet her.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttSome other time.  I don't feel like a
tttparty.

tDanny walks away.  The bus driver's ready to leave, and Red
tis honking the horn for Rafe to come.  Rafe reluctantly lets
tDanny go, and heads for the bus, where the pilots are
tchanting --

<b>tttttPILOTS VOICE
</b>tttNurses!  Nurses!  Nurses!

<b>tINT.  A MOVING TRAIN - DAY
</b>
tThe trains of 1942 have their own beauty, with felt seats,
tshaded lamps, and paneled compartments even in the economy
tsection.  But the glow of the train is outshone by EVELYN
tSTEWART.  She's one of ten young women, Army nurses, gathered
tat one end of the car as it rattles along the track.

tThe other nurses are pretty and ripe -- maybe a bit too
tripe.  Their lips painted bright red, their faces powdered,
ttheir spirits high.

tEvelyn listens in amusement to BETTY, a cute blonde with
tunmissable boobs, and BARBARA, a burnette equally endowed.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttDo you have trouble with your boobs in
tttthe uniform?

<b>tttttBARBARA
</b>tttYou mean hiding them?

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttHide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm
ttttalking about how you make them show!

tSANDRA, another nurse, speaks up.

<b>tttttSANDRA
</b>tttLoan 'em to me, I'll make 'em show.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttThe boobs or the pilots?

tThe girls laugh and shove each others' knees; it's a party
twherever they go.  But Evelyn can't keep her mind on the
tfrivolity.  She looks out the window and her thoughts drift
taway.

<b>tttttBARBARA
</b>tttWe'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttOoo, she's thinking of her date!  Come
ttton, you've been dating a pilot.  We want
tttto know what we can expect.

tSuddenly all the girlish faces are looking at Evelyn.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttI've been dating one pilot.  And only for
ttta few weeks.  But I know he's different
tttfrom all the others.

tSandra throws up her arms and swoons onto her friends.

<b>tttttSANDRA
</b>tttTrue love!...

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttMorphine, give her morphine!

<b>tttttBARBARA
</b>tttGive her an enema.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttBut I do have a warning for you.  There's
tttone line you all need to know, and you're
tttlikely to hear it from any man in a
tttuniform.  It goes like this:  "Honey,
tttBaby... We never know what's gonna happen,
tttand I may die tomorrow...so, let's live
tttall we can tonight."

tA silence among the nurses.

<b>tttttBARBARA
</b>tttI tell you.  Any one of those arrogant,
tttleather-jacketed, slick-lookin' flyboys
ttttries that line on me...he's gonna get
tttanything he wants.

tAs the nurses laugh --

<b>tEXT.  NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
</b>
tOur pilots -- indeed leather-jacketed and handsome -- are
twaiting on the platform.  Among then is Rafe, holding
tsomething behind his back, as the train pulls in and shudders
tto a stop, clouds of steam jetting onto the platform and
tgiving the moment a dream-like haze.

<b>tINT./ EXT.  TRAIN - NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
</b>
tThe nurses start stepping out; both pilots and nurses pretend
tsurprise to see each.  At the door of the train, Evelyn
twhispers to Betty --

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttStick with me, I'll find you somebody
tttgood.

tBetty spot's Rafe.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttI'll take that one.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttHe's taken.  But come on, I'll introduce
tttyou.

tThey move to Rafe; he crosses the platform to meet them, his
teyes holding Evelyn.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttHello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttYou too, Lieutenant.

tBetty clears her throat.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttOh, this is Betty.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttNice to meet you, Betty.

tHe draws his hand from behind his back; he's holding two
troses.  He hands one to Evelyn and the second to Betty.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttDanny would'a brought this.

tHe escorts them along the platform.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttDanny's not coming?

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttNo, he...got some news today.  He'll be
tttokay, he just didn't feel like coming
ttttonight.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttI was hoping to meet him.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttI was hoping to meet him.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttWe'll just have to find a substitute,
tttwon't we?

tBetty stops, and faces Rafe.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttI just want to tell you one thing.  If
tttyou're thinking this might be your last
tttnight on earth?... I'm prepared to make
tttit meaningful.
tttt(leaning close)
tttVery meaningful.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttAt ease, Betty!

<b>tINT.  CITY NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tIt's a party in full swing; swing music, jitterbugging,
tbeautiful young men and women in high spirits.

tRafe and Evelyn are sitting at a big table with the other
tpilots and nurses.  Anthony's paired up with Sandra, Billy
twith Barbara, and Red, shyest of the group, finds himself
tnext to Betty.  Betty's already found a companion in Red
tStrange.

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttHe, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttRed...Strange?

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttYou know the football player, Red G-
tttGrange?  Well the guys called me R-Red,
tttcause you know, I'm red...and they
tttthought I was strange, so, you know, Red
tttG-Grange, Red Str-Strange.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttBut...they called you Strange?  Because
tttof Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red
tttGrange strange?

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttHow would I know.

tBeside her beer is an open ketchup bottle; he picks it up and
tswigs from that.  Rafe and Evelyn see this, and try to keep
tfrom laughing.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttDo you always stutter?

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttOnly when I'm n-n-n-

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttNervous?

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttYeah.  But if I have to get something
tttout, I c-can always s-s-s-
tttt(he sings)
<b>tttSIIING!
</b>
tShe covers his hand with hers.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttDon't be nervous.

tRed looks at Betty with love in his eyes.  Under the table,
tRafe and Evelyn join hands too.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttThere shipping us out.  Hawaii.  The
tttGermans are overrunning Europe, and we're
tttsent to paradise.  How about you?  Have
tttyou heard anything?

tHe hesitates; then Evelyn is distracted by the conversation
tbeside them, between Barbara and Billy.

<b>tttttBILLY
</b>tttYou're a very special woman, and...well
tttbaby, they're training me for war, and we
tttdon't know what happens tomorrow.  So we
tttgotta make tonight special.

tBarbara shoots a look at Evelyn, before she answers.

<b>tttttBARBARA
</b>tttI hope you can back that up, flyboy.
tttCause you're not ever gonna forget
ttttonight.

tShe takes him by the hand and pulls him to his feet... They
tstart dancing, sexy movements that won't stop till they've
tbeen in bed.

tRafe pulls Evelyn to her feet, and leads her through the
tdancers, outside.

<b>tEXT.  THE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tThey find a quiet place on a balcony that overlooks the
triver, and Manhattan beyond.  Evelyn takes in the view,

</b>tttWhatever you're trying to tell me isn't

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttThe only reason it's hard to say is that

tttThat must surprise you.

</b>tttBut you're in the U.S. Army, how could

</b>tttColonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and

tHe studies her face, burning it into his memory.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttEvelyn...you know the line -- let's make
ttttonight memorable.  What I feel about you
tttmakes it impossible for me to say
tttsomething like that.  If I don't come

tShe takes his hand and leads him inside.

<b>tINT.  NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tShe leads him onto the dance floor, and they dance, among the
tothers, yet in a world apart from everyone else.  And then
tthey stop while all the others move around them, and kiss the
tkind of kiss that lasts a lifetime.

<b>tEXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
tThe nurses are entering the hotel.  Pilots are going in with
tthem.  But Rafe and Evelyn stop on the street.

tA last kiss.  Their hands touch a final time, and then part.
tShe moves inside the lobby, and looks out the glass doors as
the walks away.

<b>tEXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAWN

tRafe and Danny stand on the platform.  Rafe's got his gear
tpacked in a bag slung over his shoulder.

tRafe glances once more toward the revolving doors from the

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttYeah.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttThen why are you looking for her?

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttIt's a test.  If I asked her to come and

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYou're still a kid, ya know that?  Take

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttYou too.

tRafe sticks his hand out to Danny.  Danny knocks it away, and
thugs him.

tRafe steps onto the train, and it pulls away.  Rafe waves.
tDanny waves back and smiles, but he whispers like a prayer...

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttGive 'em hell, Rafe.

<b>tINT.  TRAIN - DAWN
</b>
tRafe finds a seat and sits down.  He's the only one in the
tcar, and he's deeply alone.

<b>tEXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAWN
</b>
tDanny walks to one of the three revolving doors back into the
tstation.  He takes the one on the far right.  As he passes
tthrough it, he doesn't see Evelyn rushing through the door on
tthe left side.  She's told herself she wouldn't come, but
tcouldn't help it, and now as she sees the last car of the
ttrain disappearing around the corner the pain of it all hits
ther.

tShe stands on the empty platform, as lonely as Rafe.

tas Rafe boards a Canadian naval vessel headed into the North
tAtlantic.

tEvelyn and her fellow nurses ride the train through the
tAmerican southwest.  The scenery outside the window is
tbeautiful, but her thoughts are far away...

<b>tEXT.  NORTH ATLANTIC - DAY
</b>
tRafe's ship is in a convoy through the rough gray waters.
tThe deck is loaded with military supplies bound for Britain.
tRafe stands among the drab crates and seems oblivious to the
train, his thoughts on Evelyn.

tHe looks toward the eastern horizon, where his ship is
theading.  A deep, dark storm is brewing before them...

<b>tEXT.  PACIFIC - DAY
</b>
tEvelyn stands on the deck of a ship headed in the opposite
tdirection, on another ocean, the sky is clear, the breeze is
twarm, the light of a glowing sunset bathes her face.  The
tMONTAGE ENDS, with them heading to different ends of the
tearth.

<b>tEXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DUSK
</b>
tIn the eternal dusk of England, everything is cold and gray.
tBritish fighter planes -- Spitfires and Hurricanes -- are
tsurrounded by mechanics hurriedly ripping off bullet riddled
tfuselage panels and digging into overworked aircraft engines.
tRafe walks across the tarmac, still carrying his duffel bag.
tHe moves up behind a slim, pale BRITISH AIR COMMANDER who is
tsurveying engine damage on one of the Spitfires.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttRafe McCawley, Sir.

tRafe salutes as the Air Commander turns and then returns the
tsalute, with his left arm -- his right arm is gone.  Rafe
tfreezes at the sight, reminded of Danny's father.

<b>tttttBRITISH AIR COMMANDER
</b>tttOn loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttThat's me, Sir.

<b>tttttBRITISH AIR COMMANDER
</b>tttGood on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll
tttget you situated in some quarters, and
tttthen introduce you to the equipment

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttIf you're patching up bullet holes right

<b>tttttBRITISH AIR COMMANDER
</b>tttAre all the Yanks as anxious as you are
tttto get yourself killed, Lieutenant?

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttNot anxious to die, Sir, anxious to
tttmatter.

<b>tEXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DAY
</b>
tA Spitfire sits on the runway, and it's badly mangled -- a
tstring of bullet holes punched through at mid-fuselage; a
tshot-off chunk of wingtip; but most striking is the blood
tstill splattered over the inside of the cockpit.

<b>tttttBRITISH AIR COMMANDER
</b>tttGood lad.  Didn't die till he'd landed
tttand shut down his engine.  Welcome to the
tttwar.

tHe walks away, leaving Rafe to stare at the bloody cockpit.

<b>tEXT.  PEARL HARBOR - MILITARY BASE - DAY
</b>
tEvelyn and the nurses enter the base, riding in two jeeps.
tAs they stop at the gate, the guards look at them, especially
tEvelyn in the lead jeep; one guard mumbles to the other --

<b>tttttGUARD
</b>tttI've died and gone to heaven.

tThe guards lift the bar and smile at the nurses.  The jeeps
tdrive through.  The nurses are loving this island paradise
talready.

<b>tttttBARBARA
</b>tttYou know the ratio of men to women on
tttthis island?  Four-thousand...to one.

tBarbara slides on a new pair of sunglasses with plastic palm
ttrees glued on the sides, and calls back to the guards as the
tjeeps pull away --

</b>tttSee ya on the beach, boys!

tAs the other nurses happily unpack, Evelyn leaves and crosses
tthe grass in the drenching sunshine.  We follow her into --

<b>tINT.  BASE HOSPITAL - DAY
</b>
tShe finds a small, immaculately clean hospital, twenty beds
twith luminous white sheets, all empty.

tThen she notices the view.  It's of Pearl Harbor, with the
tentire American Pacific fleet riding at anchor.  Battleships
tall in a row.  Aircraft carriers too, in perfect stillness on
tthe aqua blue water with a white sand bottom.  The view is
texpansive and beautiful.

tThe sound of an approaching fighter plane with wing guns
tfiring as we --

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

</b>
tRafe, in the middle of an aerial dogfight, throws his
tSpitfire into a tight turn, swinging around to fire again
tinto a squadron of Messerschmidts; they outnumber the British
tplanes, and they're tougher and faster.  Rafe darts through
ttheir line, machine guns blazing.

tOne of the Spitfires in Rafe's squadron has taken hits in the
tengine compartment and is sputtering, losing power, its
tpilot, NIGEL, frantic as the German planes swarm into finish
thim.

<b>tttttBRITISH PILOT (NIGEL)
</b>tttI need help!  Someone get them off me!

tRafe slams his control stick hard right and goes into a power
tdive at one of the Messerschmidts.  Rafe's bullets chew up
tits cockpit and the plane goes into a fast corkscrew spiral,
tdown into the water.

tRafe instantly climbs again.  Nigel, in the moment of safety
tRafe has bought him, bails out, his chute blossoming and
tcarrying him toward the water.  The OTHER BRITISH PILOTS are
timpressed.

<b>tttttOTHER BRITISH PILOT
</b>tttt(into radio)
tttNigel's out!  I'll call in the position!
tttt(to himself)
tttThat Yank is bloody good.

tRafe swings his plane right back at the Germans; he attacks
tthem head on, just like he went at Danny, only this time he's
tfiring his machine guns.

tAnd OVER THIS ferocious dogfight, we hear his letter to
tEvelyn...

<b>tttttRAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
</b>tttDear Evelyn... It is cold here.  So cold,
tttin a way that goes deep into your bones.

tThe Messerschmidt in Rafe's sights breaks apart with the
tstream of precise fire he pours into it, its prop flying into
tpieces, its disintegration accelerated by its airspeed.
tBefore it completely comes apart, it explodes.

tRafe goes into another tight turn, to get at them again.

<b>tttttRAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
</b>tttIt's not easy making friends.  Two nights
tttago I drank a beer with a couple of the
tttR.A.F. pilots -- beer's the only thing

this letter.

<b>tttttRAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)
</b>tttThere is one place I can go to find
tttwarmth, and that is to think of you.

<b>tEXT.  OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - OAHU - DAY
</b>
tEvelyn is off duty, and wears a light cotton dress.  She's
tlet her hair down, and her skin has the sheen of light sweat
tin the tropical heat.

tThe restaurant is barely more than a shelter of palm wood
tposts with a frond roof, and it looks out over the harbor.
tEvelyn sits alone.  She's brought writing paper.  As the
tHawaiian waiter serves her an icy tropical ambrosia with
tchunks of pineapple and a fresh plumeria flower floating at
tthe rim of the glass, she lifts her pen.

tBut before she can start to write, three naval officers move
tover to her table from the bar.  They're out of uniform too,
twearing garish tropical shirts.

<b>tttttNAVY GUY 1
</b>tttA woman beautiful as you shouldn't be

</b>tttI'm sorry.  I've got a letter to write.

</b>tttI said you're cold.

</b>tttCold?  No, I'm just thinking about a war.

tThey leave, shaking their heads.  Evelyn picks up her pen,
tand writes.

</b>tttDear Rafe... It's strange to be so far

</b>
tThe White House looks somehow whiter and purer in the glow of
<b>t1941.
</b>
<b>tINT.  PRESIDENTIAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
tGENERALS, ADMIRALS, and other advisors sit around the
tpolished table -- all males, in suits and in uniforms.  The
tdoor opens, and the men all stand.

tPRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT appears, in a wheelchair, pushed
tby a huge black valet, GEORGE.  The President's legs are
tshriveled, braced with the iron supports that attach to his
tshoes and are apparent beneath the cloth of his pin-striped
tpants.  From the waist up Roosevelt is heavily muscled,
tpowerful, and handsome even in his little spectacles.  The
tvalet rolls him to the head of the table; he's speaking even
tbefore he settles in.

<b>tttttPRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
</b>tttPlease be seated, gentlemen.

tThey sit, as one.

<b>tttttPRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
</b>tttChurchill and Stalin are asking me what
tttI'm asking you:  How long is America
tttgoing to pretend the world is not at war?

<b>tttttGENERAL MARSHALL

</b>tttShift in every destroyer and anti-

<b>tttttADMIRAL
</b>tttSir, our Pacific Fleet is already down
tttto almost nothing.

<b>tttttPRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
</b>tttGentlemen, at this moment the nation of
tttHungry has a larger military then the
tttUnited States.  We have no choice but to
tttdraw from whatever we can.

<b>tEXT.  ESTABLISHING TOKYO - JAPAN - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tINT.  JAPANESE HIGH COMMAND - NIGHT
</b>
tThe Conference Room is similar to that of the White House.
tBut this table is low and all the men sit on the floor.  And
tthere are no civilians here; Japan is now a nation ruled by
tits warriors.

tThe last man to enter the room and take his place is ADMIRAL
tYAMAMOTO.  Harvard educated, Yamamoto is an object of
tveneration and suspicion among the men of the war council.
tYamamoto bows, sits, and looks across the table at his friend
tGenda, who can't hide his fear.  Yamamoto glances to the far
tend of the table where NISHIKURA, chief of the War Council,
tsits glowering.  (Their discussion is in Japanese, with
tsubtitles.)

<b>tttttNISHIKURA
</b>tttSo you join us, Admiral.  Some of us
tttthought your education at an American
tttuniversity would make you too weak to
tttfight the Americans.

<b>tttttYAMAMOTO
</b>tttIf knowledge of opponents and careful
tttcalculation of danger is taken as
tttweakness then I have misunderstood what
tttit means to be Japanese.

<b>tttttNISHIKURA
</b>tttThe time has come to strike!  Or to sit
tttand let the Americans cut off our oil and
tttour future.  I know what you whisper to
tttthe others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans
tttare strong.  Yet look at their leader.

tHe motions to OYAMA, an intelligence analyst, who opens a
tfile and lays out pictures of Roosevelt.

<b>tttttOYAMA
</b>tttFranklin Roosevelt.  Born into great
tttwealth.  Fifteen years ago, he was
tttstricken with polio.  Now he cannot walk,
tttor even stand without help.
tttPhotographers will not take pictures of
ttthim in his chair; Americans do not wish
tttto know how weak their President is.

tYamamoto makes a low grunt.

<b>tttttNISHIKURA
</b>tttYou have something to say, Yamamoto?

<b>tttttYAMAMOTO
</b>tttThe Council knows I have opposed fighting
tttthe Americans.  No matter how great our
tttresolve, they have resources beyond ours.
tttIf we must go to war, there is only one
tttway -- deal them a blow from which it will
ttttake them years to recover.  In that time
tttwe can conquer all of the Pacific, and
tttthey will have no choice but to ask for
tttpeace.

<b>tttttNISHIKURA
</b>tttYou see us as capable of such a blow?

<b>tttttYAMAMOTO
</b>tttThe Americans themselves have made it
tttpossible.  We will annihilate them in a
tttsingle attack -- at Pearl Harbor.

tThe members of the war council are so pleased with Yamamoto
tthat they bow to him.  Only Genda keeps his eyes raised long
tenough to see the sadness in Yamamoto's face.

<b>tEXT.  PEARL HARBOR - AIR BASE - BARRACKS - DAY

tenter the barracks, talking happily.

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttIf I ain't n-never on a b-boat again,
tttit'll be too s-soon.

<b>tttttBILLY
</b>tttWhere are the women on this --

tDanny has stopped before the others; now all of them see that
tthe other pilots who inhabit this air base are still in their
tbeds, sleeping off hangovers.  They wear Hawaiian shirts;
tthey haven't shaved.

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttThey're s-still asleep!

tDanny pauses for a moment, then shouts --

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttDrop your cocks and grab your socks,
tttboys!  The terror of the skies are here!

tThe sleeping pilots groan, and cover their heads with their
tpillows.

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttThey're all drunk.

tOne guy sits up in bed, his hair pointing every direction of
tthe compass, his tongue working as if to wipe a terrible
ttaste from his mouth.  As his feet dangle over the side of
tthe bunk and one of them touches the floor, a sensation
treaches his sotted brain; he raises that foot to look at its
tbottom, and finds a new tattoo, on the sole of his foot; he
tblinks as if trying to remember how it got there.

tDanny moves over to him, and dubs him with a name, COMA.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttHey.  You.  Mr. Coma.

</b>tttA m-missionary?

<b>tttttCOMA
</b>tttNo, like...

tComa emits a pukey, toxic burp that has Danny and his buddies
twincing back from the fumes.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttThis is an Air Base?  Where's your squad
tttcommander?

tThe question soaks through to Coma's brain.  His right hand
tpoints...and his left hand points...in different directions.
tHis hands float around in the air until finally both of them
tare indicating the same direction, behind his back.  In the
tbunk beyond Coma's is another drunk pilot in a Hawaiian
tshirt...and to judge by the shapely bronzed leg that
tprotrudes from under his damp sheet, there's a woman with him
ttoo.

tDanny and his buddies are speechless -- except for Red
tStrange.

<b>tttttRED

</b>tttYou guys are new?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYeah.

</b>tttMai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about

tComa's head drifts forward slowly; they think for a moment
the's looking for something under the bed.  Then he pukes.
tDanny leaps back from the splatter, and marches out of the
tbarracks; his friends follow.

tof fighter planes -- and they're all bunched together in

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttHey!  What is this, the planes all

<b>tttttMECHANIC

<b>tINT.  OAHU BAR - DAY

tDanny and the pilots are in Hawaiian shirts, their party in
tfull swing.  A bucket-sized hollowed-out volcano sits in the
tmiddle of the table, with twelve straws emerging from the
tcrater.  It's full of booze -- or was; Danny and the other
tguys are pulling heartily at the straws, and they gurgle as
tthe last liquid is sucked dry.

tComa is sitting there with them, beside Red.

<b>tttttCOMA
</b>tttAbsolutely right.

tEverybody's having a ball, the new arrivals fitting right in
twith the others.  Danny's a bit off to himself, lost in his
town thoughts.  Billy and Anthony are doing the hula to the
tHawaiian music playing.

<b>tttttCOMA
</b>tttNo, you guys aren't doing it right.  It's

tComa stands and starts demonstrating, explaining the gestures
tof his hula.

timaginary breasts; but as he turns toward the windows --

<b>tttttCOMA
</b>tttA more beautiful girl walks by...

tThe guys see Evelyn passing on the other side of the street,
tgorgeous in the sunshine.  Coma's hands start squeezing the

tnuzzle up to one of the straws of the mai-tai volcano.

tDanny looks out the window again and sees Evelyn's beautiful
tform disappear around the corner, on her way back to the base
thospital.  Danny moves back to the table, and as two burly
tHawaiian waiters set another full loaded mai-tai volcano onto
tthe center of the table, he picks up a glass and dips it full
tof the potent liquid.  He shouts to the whole room --

</b>
tA seaplane takes tourists on an excursion above Pearl Harbor
tand around the island of Oahu.  One Japanese tourist shoots
tpictures rapidly...first of the ships as seen from overhead;
tthen he leans to the other side of the plane and shoots
tpictures of the airfield below them.

<b>tEXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY

</b>tttAnd the planes!  They are -- what is that

</b>tttHow can they be so foolish?

<b>tttttYAMAMOTO
</b>tttThey think no one would be stupid enough
tttto attack them at Pearl Harbor.

<b>tttttGENDA
</b>tttOr perhaps they think no one is capable.
tttLook at this...

tHe moves to a diagram displayed on the wall -- a simple
tdisplay showing water depth and ship displacement.

<b>tttttGENDA
</b>tttPearl Harbor's depth of only forty feet
tttmakes them feel safe.  A torpedo dropped
tttfrom an airplane plunges to one hundred
tttfeet before it can level off.  That is a
tttconventional torpedo.  But we have been
tttexperimenting.

tFrom a stand beside his diagram he takes a set of wooden
tfins, attached to a circular metallic band.

</b>tttWooden fins.  We are testing them
ttttomorrow.

<b>tEXT.  JAPANESE ISLAND - DAY
</b>
tYamamoto and his planners have flown to a quiet Japanese
tisland, sunlit and pleasant.  They are gathered on the shore
tof the island's natural harbor.  Wooden targets -- basically
thuge plank barriers -- are sunk into the water like ships at
tanchor.  A squadron of Japanese planes zooms overhead, taking
tup attack positions.

<b>tttttGENDA
</b>tttWe have chosen this place because its
tttdepth is exactly the same as Pearl
tttHarbor's.

tGenda speaks into a field radio.  A lone plane drops out of
tformation and goes into a low-level approach, speeding up and
tdropping its torpedo.

tBELOW THE SURFACE we see the torpedo as it plunges at two
thundred miles an hour into the sunlit sea.  With the wooden
tfins the torpedo makes a sharp dip and levels off above the
tsea floor.

tABOVE THE SURFACE the planners see the path of the torpedo;
tit hits the wooden barrier with a satisfying THUNK.  The
tplanners are impressed -- but Yamamoto is not satisfied.

<b>tttttYAMAMOTO
</b>tttUncharged torpedoes have different
tttbalance.

<b>tttttGENDA
</b>tttI have arranged a live fire drill -- with
tttyour permission.

tYamamoto nods; Genda speaks again into his radio, and another
tplane swoops down and drops a torpedo.  Genda holds his hands
tto his ears, causing the others to do the same; even though
tthey wonder at the need.

tThe torpedo hits the barrier, and the explosion is deafening,
tand of shocking force; the entire barrier is blown to
ttoothpicks.

<b>tttttGENDA
</b>tttOf course against a ship the explosion
tttwill not be dissipated, and will have
tttmore force.

tThe planners, nearly blown off their feet, nod as if they
tknew that all the time.

tttOh...Betty, Betty, Betty, you're the one

tsings.

tAnthony and Billy are hysterical, trying to keep their
tlaughter hidden.  But then they see the effect this is having
ton the women -- especially on Betty.  She's smitten.

tRed repeats the verse, really getting into it; when he
tfinishes, Betty runs out and hugs him, as all the nurses
tapplaud.  They move off into the darkness, arm and arm.

tThe nurses go back to their primping.

tAnthony and Billy are changed men.  Anthony stands up;
tBilly's baffled.  Anthony moves out and starts singing.

tRafe is one of the pilots; the fuselage below his cockpit is
tmarked with four swastikas, symbols of his victories.  He
ttaxis to a stop, and is met by IAN, a Scottish mechanic, who
tis dismayed at the state of the plane.

teverybody running.

<b>tEXT.  SKIES OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - NIGHT
</b>
tIt's dark, but there are breaks in the clouds, giving way to
tpatches of light from a full moon.  The squadron of Spitfires
ttightens up for battle.

tRafe is positioned just right of the squad leader; he sees
tplanes breaking out of the dark clouds ahead.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttHere they come.

tThe clouds break, revealing a huge attack formation.

<b>tttttBRITISH SQUAD LEADER
</b>tttAlpha group, on the bombers!  Beta group,

tThey peel off, into action.

</b>
tWe stay with Rafe as he and the Squad Leader rush side by
tside at the lead bomber, blasting away with their guns.

<b>tINT.  GERMAN BOMBER - IN THE AIR - NIGHT
</b>
tThe Spitfires' bullets rip into the pilot and also kill the
tnose gunner; the bomber dips as the copilot struggles to take
tcontrol.

<b>tINT.  RAFE, IN HIS SPITFIRE - NIGHT
</b>
tAs he streaks past, Rafe sees the bomber wobble in the air.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttWe've got him hurt, stay on him!

tRafe throws his plane into an ultra-tight, high speed turn,
tright between the tails of the leader German group and the
tnoses of the second.  His turn is so tight that the plane
tflexes with the g-force.

tRafe comes out of his turn ahead of the Squad Leader, and
traces back up through the formation of German bombers, moving
tabove them where their weapons and armaments are the weakest.
tHe stitches a trail of bullets from tail to nose of the
twounded lead bomber; it begins to smoke.

tThe second Spitfire, the Squad Leader's, takes fire from the
tother German bombers, and shears off, heading through the
tsmoke of the plane Rafe has on the ropes.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttWe've got him going!

tRafe does a half-loop and half-spin, to bring him around to
tface the bombers again.  This time the g-force of the turn
tpops an oil line inside Rafe's cockpit; hot, pressurized oil
tbegins to spray everywhere -- all over Rafe, his controls,
tand worst of all, over the inside of his cockpit glass.

tHe wipes at the oil with his hands and that just smears it
tand makes it worse.

tHis wingman sees him veering away from the bombers...and sees
tthe German fighters moving up to meet him.

<b>tttttSQUAD LEADER
</b>tttMcCawley!  Get to the clouds!  Get into
tttthe clouds!

tRAFE, IN HIS PLANE, is flying blind.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI can't see the clouds!

tHis problems are just beginning; the fluid is dripping down
tonto his cockpit's corroded electrical wiring; the fluid
tcauses an arc...a spark...and suddenly a fire is spreading
tthrough Rafe's plane.

tHe grabs his fire extinguisher and triggers a cloud that
tsnuffs the fire but fills the entire cockpit with choking
tsmoke; between that and the smeared fluid on his glass, he
tcan't see a thing.

tAnd the Messerschmidts are swarming over him.

tRafe's wingman dives in, raking the German planes as he
tpasses.

tRafe tries to open his cockpit cover to clear the smoke, but
tit's jammed; he pulls out his .45 pistol and BLAM!  BLAM!
tBLAM!  He blows out the glass; the smoke clears enough for
thim to take a breath and try to see.  He fights the stick,
tbut the plane won't respond.

tThe Messerschmidts rake him again, bullets riddling his
tengine.

<b>tttttSQUAD LEADER
</b>tttGet out of there, McCawley!  Get out of
tttthere!

tRafe's plane descends, ever faster, passing through clouds,
tthen clear air again.  The Squad Leader tries to chase and
tcover him, but Rafe's dropping fast, and still isn't out of
tthe plane as the Germans dive on him again, firing.

tRafe's Spitfire hits the broken fog over the water -- the
tSquad Leader loses sight of it for a moment -- and then the
tplane hits, splashing and exploding all at once.

tThe Squad Leader winces, and ducks into the clouds as he
treports on his radio...

tThe sailors have assembled on deck for the ship's heavyweight
tchampionship fight, a contest made more interesting to the
tsailors because one of the combatants is white and the other
tis black.

tThe battle is more toughness than technique.  The guys
tthrowing haymakers and shoving each other around the roped
tarea, as their shipmates cheer and make wild bets.  The white
tguy digs a punch deep into the black guy's ribs, and the
tblack guy slams a double left hook into the white guy's
tbelly, making him back up and say --

<b>tttttWHITE BOXER
</b>tttYou hit hard -- for a cook.

tThe black guy rushes the white guy, only to catch a right
tcross that wobbles his knees and makes him stagger, with a
tfresh cut over his right eye.  The white guy now rushes in,
tand the black guy (his name is DORIE MILLER) throws an upper
tcut that drops his opponent like a sack of rocks.

tThe sailors cheer wildly.  Dorie steps back, and rubs his
tglove across his brow.  It's really bleeding now.

tcan't make out his face, but he's wearing a pilot's dress

tand she doubles up in shattering grief.

tDanny can't just stand there; he moves back to her, and puts
ta hand on her shoulder.  He sits beside her again, and

tADMIRALS and other OFFICERS are gathered around a giant map
tof the Pacific.

<b>tttttADMIRAL
</b>tttThe attack seems inevitable.  The
tttquestion is where?  The way to answer
tttthat question is to ask:  if we were the
tttJapanese, how would we do it?

tHe nods to a VICE ADMIRAL, who stands over the map.

<b>tttttVICE ADMIRAL
</b>tttBetween America and the Far East are the

tttcurrents make the best route for
tttshipping.  Far above is the northern

tttBetween these two is something they call
tttthe Vacant Sea.  If I were the Japs, I'd
tttsend a task force there.  You could hide

</b>tttSo they pop out and attack where?

tA huge Japanese fleet steams toward Hawaii.  It is an awesome

</b>tttPlease excuse me.  Just relax.

tLeaving his patient with a mouth full of instruments, the

tHe switches on the recording equipment and looks to the
tTRACER, sitting at a battery of equipment.

<b>tttttINTELLIGENCE SUPERVISOR
</b>tttThis dentist, is he a spy?

tEvelyn opens her basket, and finds a lei of Hawaiian flowers

taround Evelyn's neck.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttIt's been a month and you haven't smiled.

tEvelyn walks out of the hospital.  She's still wearing her
tlei.  The sun is going down in a spectacular sunset.

tShe stares at the orange glow at the edge of the world.  She
tbreathes in the sea air, and tries to breathe out the
tsadness.  The water of the harbor laps close to where she
tstands, the sunset polishing its surface.

tShe takes the lei from her neck, plucks a single flower, and
tholds it like the rose Rafe once gave her.  Then she tosses
tthe rest of the lei into the ocean and watches it float away,
tas the sun sinks behind the horizon.

<b>tINT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

</b>tttWe got some soldiers in traction from a

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttThat might not have been such a good

tttis that I won't be back to the barracks
ttttill it's too late for dinner or coffee.
tttSo I guess it's goodbye for awhile.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttI was just thinking that war is a series

tttwe're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to
tttRafe?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttI swore not to talk about him tonight,
tttbut there's all this stuff I think I
tttought to tell you, that he didn't get a
tttchance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He
ttthad such high expectations of himself
tttthat he always felt empty.  The week he
tttmet you he told me he felt his heart had
tttalways lived in winter, and for the first
ttttime in his life he has seen the spring.

tHe's been lost in his own thoughts of Rafe; now he notices
tthe tears welling up in her eyes.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttSorry.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttHe told me he didn't want to leave me
tttwith regret.  Now that's all I have.

tfull moon.

<b>tINT.  P-40 - NIGHT
</b>
tEvelyn sits on Danny's lap, like Rafe sat in his Daddy's lap
tyears before.  Danny flies easily, the cockpit open, his arms
tslipped under hers.

tThe sky above them is startlingly clear; a billion stars
tdancing around a full moon.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttSo beautiful!

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttHang on.

tHe spins the plane in an easy half turn, inverting their
theads above Pearl Harbor, gorgeous in the moonlight, the
tbattleships aglow, the moon reflected in the peaceful water,
tembraced by the island of Oahu.

<b>tEXT.  HALEIWA AIR FIELD - NIGHT
</b>
tThe P-40 soars easily in and settles to earth.  Danny shuts
tdown the engine.  Danny carefully removes the harness around
ther.  She looks overhead.  The stars are still bright above
tthem.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttI didn't realize until tonight that I've
tttstopped wanting to live.

tShe turns in his lap, and looks at him.  Their eyes connect.
tTentatively, almost reluctantly, they kiss.

<b>tEXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</b>
tThe POV of someone moving through the gathering darkness
tapproaches the hospital.

tThe lights from within the hospital, and the pristine white
tbeds beneath those lights, give the place a kind of glow,
twhere Evelyn moves alone and beautiful, like a ballerina in a
tgiant's jewel box.

tNow we see the shoulders of the figure, from behind, and can
ttell that it is a man in uniform, but at first we can't tell
twho.  He's standing dead still, transfixed in watching Evelyn
tthrough the windows.

<b>tINT.  BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</b>
tEvelyn moves to her desk, and sits down.  She looks at the
tcalender turning back to October, where she wrote on the
tsquare of October 22, "Order supplies" -- she counts the
tweeks from then to today, December 6.

<b>tEXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</b>
tWe see the full figure of the man watching her.  And now we
tsee his face.  It is Rafe.

tHis left hand is bandaged, but he is very much alive --
tthough seeing Evelyn has taken his breath, and even seems to
thave robbed him of the power to move.  His eyes pick up every
tdetail of her -- her face...her hands.

tAnd as Rafe watches Evelyn, he has the SUDDEN JOLTS OF
tSUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS...punctuated by fragments of the letter
tshe wrote to him, and INTERCUT with Rafe in the present,
twatching Evelyn.

<b>tttttEVELYN'S VOICE
</b>tttDearest Rafe --

tIN SUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK, RAFE'S SPITFIRE, crippled and
ttrailing smoke, passing through a patch of cloud as Rafe
thurls himself from the cockpit and jerks the ripcord of his
tchute.

tIN THE PRESENT...Rafe's face winces with the memory, and he
trivets his eyes on Evelyn, as if to force himself to know
tthat this moment is real.

tSUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK...RAFE LANDS IN THE WATER, and the shock
tof its coldness travels up his body faster than his body
tsinks into the water.  He's cloaked in the fog; his
tparachute, pushed by the wind, is pulling him along face
tdown.  He fights with the straps, flips himself over, and
tpulls the release...

tBut he's still in desperate trouble; in his flying clothes,
this heavy leather jacket soaking with sea-water, he's going
tdown; his body sinks beneath the surface...

<b>tttttEVELYN'S VOICE
</b>ttt...Every sunset...

tIN THE PRESENT, Rafe's chest trembles... Is it from the
tmemory of the frozen water, from the emotion of seeing Evelyn
tagain -- or both?

tSUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS -- Below the surface of the North Sea,
tRafe's body drifts, but he fights his way back up...he kicks
toff his shoes, sheds the jacket, strips off his pants and
tstarts tying the cuffs into knots.

tThen, in a CUT, he is floating in the water, his pants turned
tinto a makeshift life preserver, his body shaking
tconvulsively from the cold.

tThen in another CUT we see him after he's been in the water
tfor so long that his body no longer trembles; he's lost
tconsciousness.  He has no strength, no will to live... His
tface settles into the water...his body slips from his
tpreserver, and drifts beneath the surface...

<b>tttttEVELYN'S VOICE
</b>ttt...gather it's heat into my heart, and
tttsend it to you...

tIN FLASHBACK, Rafe beneath the surface... His eyes come open.
tFrom his POV beneath the water, he sees something above the
tsurface.  It's only in his mind, but that makes it no less
treal...an orange glow, the warmth of the sunset, and her face
tabove the surface... His limbs come to life, and he fights
this way up, breaking the surface.  The whole sea around him
tis dark and empty, but he grabs his makeshift preserver and
tholds on for dear life...and for Evelyn.

tIN THE PRESENT Rafe stares through the window, at Evelyn, but
the can't go in.  He backs away from the window.

<b>tINT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</b>
tEvelyn puts away the calender.

<b>tEXT.  MILITARY BASE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</b>
tRafe is sitting at the bench, his head down.

tANGLE - Evelyn on the path; she sees someone on the bench,
this form hauntingly familiar.  He hears her, and looks up.
tIt's Rafe.

tFrom Evelyn's POV, the whole world spins.  She faints.

tRafe jumps to catch her before she slams to the ground.  He
tgathers her into his arms, and she looks up into his face.
tHe's real, very real.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttEvelyn.

tShe's trembling, shaking.  He lifts her to her feet, and
tmoves her to the bench.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI sent telegrams, I guess the military

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttWhy were you sitting here, instead of...

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just

tttminute.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttHow did you?...

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>ttt...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog,
tttand nobody could see me.  I hit the water
ttthard.  And it was so...cold.

tHe looks toward the horizon, when the last light of day fades
tto black.  There's something he thinks about saying, and
tdoesn't.  Then...

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI don't know how long I was in the water.
tttA Norwegian freighter picked me up.  They
tttwere headed to Spain.  They docked in La
tttRota, right beside a German ship, and
ttttold me to stay hidden below.  I was
tttafraid they'd turn me in, so I stole some
tttclothes, jumped ship, and found a church,
tttwhere the priest contacted the

tHe looks at her, then looks down again.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI called my folks, then Colonel

</b>tttI'm so sorry for what you must've gone

tttHave you fallen in love?

tShe nods; she can't even say it.  Rafe's dying inside.

</b>tttIt's all right.  Danny always said I see

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttIt's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I
tttwrote you, they --

tttcheer them up.

<b>tttttEVELYN
</b>tttIt's not that I didn't mean everything I

tDanny runs up, through the darkness.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYou're alive!

tRafe and Danny stare at each other; Danny hesitates, looking
tfrom Rafe to Evelyn, wondering what they've said.  Then Rafe
tlooks at Evelyn, and picks up the look on her face.  In that
tmoment he puts it all together.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttAw, God.  Oh my God.

tDanny's speechless, and for a moment Evelyn is too.

<b>tEXT.  SHORE OF PEARL HARBOR - NIGHT

tRafe stares out at the harbor, seeing nothing.  As he stands
tthere alone and shattered, he has one more

<b>tSUBLIMINAL FLASHBACK
</b>
tRafe is in the water of the North Sea; he seems dead, but his
tmakeshift preserver is keeping his face above the surface.
tSomething slides through the water and stops beside him; it's
ta dinghy, and behind it is a trawler.

tHands grab Rafe and drag him onto the dinghy...

tIn a QUICK CUT, Rafe's body is laid out on the deck of the
ttrawler.  The crewmen think he's dead.  His body is stiff,
this lips white; and they say so, in Norwegian...

tBut one of the other crewmen notices a quiver in his eyelid,
tthen quickly covers Rafe with his on wool peacoat and presses
tback an eyelid to see his pupils.  Rafe's white lips move.
tThe crewmen realize he's trying to say something.

tAnd Rafe does utter something, barely audible; something the
tNorwegian crewmen don't understand.

<b>tttttRAFE

</b>tttDon't worry.  I'll find him.

tHe hugs her; their embrace earnest yet tingled with guilt,
tand Danny leave quickly.  Betty steps out of the nurses'
tquarters and hands Evelyn a telegram.

<b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttThis came while you were gone.

tEvelyn knows it's the telegram from Rafe, to tell her he's
talive.  Without opening it, she begins to cry, and hurries
taway from the barracks so the other nurses won't see.

<b>tEXT.  HICKAM FIELD - NIGHT
</b>
tDanny crosses the tarmac toward the clustered P-40's.  He
tspots what he's looking for.  Sitting in the cockpit of one
tof the P-40's is Rafe.  Rafe won't look at him.  Danny climbs
tup on the wing, and sits down there.

</b>tttUpset?  Why should I be upset?

</b>
<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttDrink up.  Then we'll talk.

tRafe takes the challenge, and takes a long pull on one of the

tbar.

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttRafe?!

tThey rush the table...

<b>tINT.  FUNKY OAHU BAR - LATER

</b>tttWaitress!  Four beers!

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYou don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttIf you can't keep up, don't drink yours.

tThe waitress delivers four bottles to the table.  Rafe takes
ta slow sip, then stares at Danny.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttWe gotta face some facts here.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttWhat facts are those?

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI understand how it could happen.  I know
tttwhy any guy would love her.  And I can't

tttI was dead, she was grieving, you were
ttttrying to help her.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttI was grieving too.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttYeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttSo what are you saying?

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI'm saying now you do know.  So it's time

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYou left her.  How's that for a fact?

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttHow's this for a fact?  I loved her
tttfirst.

tDanny takes a long pull of beer, and Rafe does the same.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYou know, you're a lousy drinker.
tttDrinking's supposed to make men feel
tttbigger.  It only makes you stupid.  And
tttweak.

tRafe nods thoughtfully, and sets down his beer.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttHow's this?

tBAM!  He knocks Danny out of the chair, flat on his ass.
tDanny backhands the blood from the corner of his mouth.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYou want it, you got it.

tHe kicks Rafe in the back of the knee, then mule kicks him in
tthe chest as he goes down, and the fight is on.

tThe bar's bouncer, a big Samoan, moves over to break them up
t-- but Anthony steps in his way.

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttLet 'em fight, they need it.

tThe bouncer tosses Anthony aside, but before he can move in
tto interrupt the fight, Red breaks a lava volcano of Mai-Tai
tover the bouncer's skull.  The bartender picks up the phone
tto call the M.P.'s.

tRafe and Danny are exchanging punches in the middle of the
troom.  Sailors sitting at the bar have swung around on their

tHe squeezes his eyes shut, and looks again; the planes start
tbombing the distant hangers.

tRed pisses along the wall as he races to the barracks, trying
tto get his pecker back into his drawers.  He shouts to the
tsleeping guys --

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttTh-th-th-th-th-

tHe slaps his face with both hands, and stomps his feet...

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttTh-th-th-th-Dammit!  Th-th-th-

tHe still can't get it out, can't wake them; bursting with
tfrustration, he suddenly blasts out singing --

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttt(singing)
tttThe Jaaaps!!  The Jaaaps!!

tHe's belting it like a baritone in a bizarre opera.  His
tfriends stir; what the hell?  Red points outside and tries to
ttalk, but now he can't mutter a syllable.  The guys hear the
texplosions, and realize...

<b>tEXT.  HICKAM FIELD - BARRACKS - DAY
</b>
tThe pilots stagger out, half drunk, half dressed.  Seeing
twhat's happening, they race toward the flight line, where the
tclustered American planes are blowing up in groups, and the
tpilots are knocked to the ground.

<b>tttttBILLY
</b>tttGoddamn Japs!

tBilly jumps to his feet and starts to run toward a cluster of
tfighters that hasn't gone up yet.

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttBilly!

tAnthony tries to grab him and drag him back to earth but he
tmisses; Billy gets a few steps before the fire from a
tstrafing Zero catches up to him; his friends watch in horror
tas Billy gets shorter as he runs; the Zero's machine gun fire
tis sawing his legs off from the feet up.

tBilly falls, legless but still alive; then a bomb falls
talmost on top of him, sending body parts over the pilots.

tTheir innocence, like America's, is gone in that moment.

<b>tEXT.  ROAD TO MAIN AIRFIELD - DAY
</b>
tDanny and Rafe are in Danny's Buick, hung over and asleep,
tDanny in front, Rafe in back, and they're a miserable sight
t-- their shirts ripped, blood dried in a leak trail from one
tside of Rafe's nose and the corner of Danny's mouth.

tThe rumble of planes moving overhead makes them stir; the
trumble grows huge, as the shadows of a massive formation
tmakes the sunlight flicker.  Danny and Rafe squint up, their
theads pounding, and realize what they're seeing.  Suddenly
ttheir headaches are gone, and Danny's gunning the Buick down
tthe road, toward the base.

<b>tEXT.  AIR BASE - DAY
</b>
tDanny blasts through the main gate; the guards are too busy
ttaking cover and haven't even closed the barrier.

tHe races to the tarmac, where some of the planes are still
tundamaged.  Rafe is out the door before the car stops
trolling, and Danny's right behind him.

tThey're running toward a cluster of fighters, when it goes up
twith a bomb blast.  Rafe and Danny dive at each other; their
tfirst instinct is to cover their best friend with their own
tbodies.

tThey look at each other on the ground.  They see machine gun
tbullets thudding into the planes on the flight line, and
tripping along the walls of the buildings.  It's as if the
twhole Japanese airforce is attacking this one base, and not
tleaving a single plane airworthy.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttGet me into a plane!

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttCome on!

tDanny sprints; Rafe follows.  Danny reaches a phone booth,
tand digs a dime from his pants.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttYou're making a phone call?!

tDanny dials, as waves of bullets sweep the area, and more
tplanes blow up on the flight line.  Rafe thinks he's lost his
tmind.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttt(into phone)
tttThis is Walker!  We're under attack!  Get
tttthose planes fueled and armed RIGHT NOW!

tHe runs back toward the car; Rafe, in the nonsense of battle,
treaches in to hang up the receiver, before Danny grabs him
tand leads him on a sprint to the car, as the phone booth
tshatters behind them from the strafing.

tOn the way to the car they dive back to the ground to avoid
tstrafing -- and see their friends lying nearby, in shock.

<b>tttttANTHONY
</b>tttThey got Billy.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttCome with us!

tHe and Rafe jump up and run again.  Anthony, Red, and several
tother pilots reach the Buick and dive in.  Danny drives away,
tthrough the strafing.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttWhere are we going?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttAuxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles
tttnorth of here.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttWhat's there?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttSix P-40's.

tAs the Zero pilots see the Buick moving, they go after it.
tDanny drives like a madman through the strafing, zigzagging
tand gunning the Buick's V-8.

<b>tEXT.  THE OKLAHOMA - STILL AT ANCHOR - DAY
</b>
tThe number of attacking planes seems endless -- and their
tstrategy flawless.  Torpedoes hitting one ship lifts its hull
twith a blast, enabling the next wave of torpedoes to rush
tunder and hit the next ship anchored behind.  The American
tbattleships are bobbing like see-saws.

tThe OKLAHOMA takes an entire barrage of torpedoes, blowing
tthirty foot holes along it's hull; the ship immediately
tbegins to list.

<b>tINT.  THE OKLAHOMA - DAY
</b>
tDoors are wedged shut by the deformation of the structure;
tvertical ladders are becoming horizontal, and water is
tpouring in.  Men fight their way up against the water.

<b>tINT.  INNER COMPARTMENT OF THE OKLAHOMA - DAY
</b>
tWater is up to the trapped sailor's waists when they grab a
twrench and start taking turns pounding S.O.S. in Morse code
ton the bulkhead.

<b>tEXT.  DECK OF OKLAHOMA - DAY
</b>
tAs the listing grows more severe, sailors start jumping from
tthe deck into the water.  Still the Marines on deck are
tfiring back at the planes; some Marines are even using
thandguns.  But courage does not save them...

<b>tTHE OKLAHOMA ROLLS OVER
</b>
tThe men still on its deck try to run, but it's not just the
tfires and the water they can't escape; the gun turrets' 1400
tpound shells break loose with the capsizing of the ship and
ttumble through everything like massive wrecking balls.

tThe sailors and marines, thrown into the water, struggle to
tget away from the suction as the giant battleship turns
tturtle.

tBELOW THE WATER men are sucked down with amazing force, every
thair on their heads streaming behind them as they're snatched
tto the depths.

tINSIDE THE OKLAHOMA, everyone and everything is spilling
tupside down.  The ship's generators sputter out and the
tlights go out.  The flashlights of the few sailors who can
tfind them cut raggedly through the darkness, and water spills
tin.  There is no escape.

tBELOW THE WATER, the Oklahoma's superstructure hits bottom;
tsome men are crushed there.  For others it's salvation, as
tthe BACKWASH blows them toward the surface.

tON THE SURFACE the men are launched almost completely out of
tthe water, before splashing back into the water and burning
toil.  A few feet of the steel hull and a portion of the
tpropeller protrude above the surface, but most of the
tOklahoma is under water.

tMen in the water swim toward a medical launch carrying
twounded away from the wreckage.  A bomb hits the launch and
tblows body parts everywhere.

<b>tINT.  OKLAHOMA - REAR COMPARTMENT
</b>
tIn one compartment there are a dozen trapped men.  They've
tsurvived the roll-over, and are in a chaotic world where the
tfloor is now the ceiling.  The water is up their waists.
tSome of the SAILORS are panicking.

tOne sailor has a flashlight and switches it on, flashing the
tlight from face to face.

<b>tttttSAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
</b>tttDon't panic!  Don't panic!

<b>tttttPANICKED SAILOR
</b>tttThe water's rising!  It's coming up,
tttwe're all gonna drown!

<b>tttttSAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
</b>tttThe air pressure will equalize it!

tBut the water keeps rising, along with their fears.  Several
tof the sailors are still screaming...

tThe water's already to their bellies.  One of them grabs a
twrench and starts slamming Morse code against the bulkhead.

tOne sailor in the middle of the room is particularly
tpanicked, not just yelling but crying and whimpering --

<b>tttttTERRIFIED SAILOR
</b>tttGet me out!  Get me out!

<b>tttttSAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
</b>tttStop it!  Come on!  Save your air!

<b>tttttTERRIFIED SAILOR
</b><b>tttMY FOOT'S CAUGHT!
</b>
tHe's at the lower end of the compartment, where the water is
tdeeper -- the ship's nose is lower than her stern.  The
twater's up to the guy's neck.

tThe man with the flashlight dives down, and finds the guys
tfoot wedged together in the pipes of the ships ceiling -- now
ttheir floor.

tHe pops up again.  The water's up to the trapped guy's mouth;
the's already gagging.

<b>tttttSAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT
</b>tttIs there a hacksaw in that locker?!

tThey open it; tools spill out -- among them is a hacksaw.
tThey hand it to him; the sailor dives down and cuts off the
tguy's foot.

tThe trapped man is underwater, muffling his scream.  He comes
tfree, and surfaces gasping.  His severed foot floats to the
tsurface and then the horror really hits them.  The sailor
twith the flashlight pops up, in the blossoming of blood.  He
tand another sailor tie a tourniquet around the stump, to stop
tthe bleeding.

tThe drama of this has caused the other trapped men to stop
ttheir signaling.  Now they start banging, twice as loudly as
tbefore.

<b>tEXT.  HALEIWA - AUXILIARY AIRFIELD - DAY
</b>
tHaleiwa is a tiny airfield, tucked among the green volcanic
thills; its barely paved, and it's only permanent building is
ta quonset hut.  A mechanic named EARL, is out with the
tP-40's; and these are spread out, not bunched.

<b>tEARL AND THE P-40'S
</b>
tThe planes here have received loving care from Earl -- which
tmeans lots of cursing; as he's wrestling to load an ammo
tbelt, he yells.

<b>tttttEARL
</b>tttSum-bitch!

tThe Buick, bullet holes punched through the truck, slides to
ta stop near the planes, and the pilots jump out.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttThey ready, Earl?

<b>tttttEARL
</b>tttThey'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...

tWhat stops him is the cloud of Zeros and dive bombers,
tshrieking in.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttCover!

tThe guys scatter.  There are sandbags around the hut, and
tthey run there, diving into it's shelter just before the
tfirst strafing pass, when a Zero strafes one of the P-40's
tand a dive bomber blasts another.  Earl stands up in shock
tand fury.

<b>tttttEARL
</b>tttYou absolute mother-fuckin' son of a
tttbitch!  You shot one of my planes!

tDanny pulls him down, as the Zeros roar overhead.

</b>tttThey're coming around for another pass.
tttYou got extra weapons and ammo?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYou guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come
tttwith me!

tDanny, Rafe and Earl run to the planes that got hit and strip
tout the 20mm cannons and ammo.

<b>tINT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY
</b>
tThe other pilots run in, throw open the gun locker, and start
tgrabbing weapons -- aircraft machine guns, ammo belts, one
teven grabs a rifle.

<b>tSANDBAGS BY THE SHED
</b>
tThe two groups run back and start to set up.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttDanny, over there!  We're in a canyon,
tttthey'll come straight down it, we'll get
ttt'em in a crossfire.

tDanny, Rafe and Earl run to a gully opposite the shed and set
tup there, as the other pilots brace the machine guns against
tthe sandbags.

tThe Japanese planes attacks again.  This time the lead plane
thits a wall of steel fired from the combined guns; the
tbullets chew into the bomb it carries and the plane EXPLODES.
tThe airborne debris makes the following planes shear off.

tRed's standing, firing; he yells at the Zeros --

<b>tttttRED
</b>tttD-don't like it when we fight back, do
tttya!

tRed runs out with his machine gun and keeps firing even when
tthe planes have passed, trying to shoot them right up the
tass.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttEarl!  You said the planes were ready
tttbut -- but what?

<b>tttttEARL
</b>tttOf the four left, only one is full of

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttWill the others get into the air?

tEarl shoots a look to Rafe, then turns to Danny.

<b>tttttEARL
</b>tttDanny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttAnthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma,
tttyou cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come

</b>tttHow do we do it?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYour call, Rafe.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttGet rolling as fast as you can.  Stay
tttlow!  We'll use the topography to
tttseparate them and then we can take 'em
tttone on one.

tThey race toward the planes, and the Japanese attack again.
tSeeing the pilots running for the P-40's, the Zeros aim for
tthem; Rafe and Danny race for the most distant of the planes;
tJoe and Theo run for the closer planes, through the dusty
tbullet hits.

tTheo makes his plane and is just strapping himself in when
tbullets stitch his fuselage, wounding him.  He still forces
tthe plane forward.  He taxis twenty feet and his cockpit gets
tchopped up and the plane arches into a right turn and putters
tto a stop, Theo dead at the controls.

tJoe doesn't bother to strap in; he hits the throttle hard and
theads down the runway...

tThe Zeros are on him as he gets ten feet of air at 120 M.P.H.
tThe Zero's bullets eat his canopy and plane skin; the plane
tbreaks apart in mid air, spilling in gouts of flame as it
tsmashes down on the tarmac.

tRafe and Danny have reaches the more distant P-40's and are
trevving their engines as they see Joe and Theo's fate.  They
tthrow on their radio headsets.

tTheir way seems blocked:  they've got no runway behind them,
tthe wreckage of four P-40's scattered ahead of them, and the
tZeros screaming over the low hills to attack them.  Now Rafe
tand Danny talk through the radio.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttIt's tight.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttTighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season.
tttDon't hit the barn.

tThey gun their engines and roll through the grass on either
tside of the runway, dodging the burning planes; they lift
toff, clearing the quonset hut by a couple of inches.  They
tblow right through the strafing fire, and into the sky.

tEight Zeros are all over them.

tEarl is in the hut, on the radio and watching through
tbinoculars.

<b>tttttEARL
</b>tttI see six...seven...eight of the
tttcocksuckers!  Don't let 'em hurt my

tDanny's swiveling in his seat, looking left, right, back.

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttThey're all over us!

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttBet they don't dust crops in Japan.

tDanny understands immediately, following Rafe's tactic as he
tbreaks into a sharp turn and uses the hut, palm trees, and
tlow hills to shake the Japs.  They fly like crop dusters,
tskimming down a foot from the ground, then bobbing up,
tbanking left and right.  The Zeros have divided into two
tgroups to chase them, their wings clipping tree tops as they
ttry to follow the Americans.

tIt feels like a 200 M.P.H. car chase, 20 feet off the ground,
tRafe and Danny skimming and bobbing over the terrain, but
tthere are too many Japanese.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttDanny!  Let's play some chicken!

tDanny banks in one direction, Rafe in another...

<b>tEXT.  OVER THE LANDING STRIP - DAY
</b>
tThe two P-40's are screaming, rushing at each other like they
tdid at the training base back in the states, flying right
tinto each other's propellers; the Japanese heading after them
trealize they're rushing headlong at the other group...

<b>tttttEARL
</b>tttOh shit, oh shit...

tHe can't even watch.

tAt the last instant Rafe and Danny snap a quarter spin so the
tplanes flash by belly to belly.

tTwo of the Zeros collide in mid-air, exploding, as the other
tZeros scatter.

<b>tEXT.  SKIES ABOVE PEARL HARBOR - DAY
</b>
tDanny and Rafe rejoin each other in the open sky; they've
tlost the Zeros.  The P-40's are flying smoothly, side by
tside.  The two pilots look across at each other, going into
tbattle together.  They speak through their radios.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttYou hear my okay?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttYeah.  So you can call me if you need
ttthelp.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI got a half a tank.  You?

<b>tttttDANNY
</b>tttLittle less.

tHe fires a short burst to see if his guns work; they do.
tRafe does the same.  Up ahead they see a formation of
tJapanese planes, headed toward Pearl.

tSide by side the P-40's scream in.

<b>tEXT.  ABOVE OAHU - THE DOGFIGHT - DAY

tThe Japanese planes are in tight, disciplined formation,
ttheir minds on the targets below them in the harbor.  But
ttheir day of shooting sitting ducks changes as the two P-40's
tblast in, wing guns blazing, chopping into Two Zeros.  Both
tZeros falter and begin to lose altitude.  The P-40's make
talmost impossible tight turns, still side-by-side, and go
tafter the two plane they crippled on the first pass.

tRafe finishes one Zero, making it explode in a ball of flame
tin the air.  Danny finishes the other, shooting off its wing
tso that it spirals into the sea and crashes there.

tThe P-40's swoop up again.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttThey're trying to hold formation.  We can
tttchew 'em up!

tThe P-40's dig in again, swooping down on the line of Zeros.
tRafe hits first, machine gunning one plane, and Danny comes
tin behind it, finishing it off.

tThe Japanese pilots are screaming at each other over their
tradios, but their SQUADRON COMMANDER sees Pearl Harbor ahead,
tand tells them --

<b>tttttJAPANESE SQUADRON COMMANDER
</b>tttHold the line!

tThe P-40's come through again, their guns spitting fire.

<b>tEXT.  ANOTHER JAPANESE FORMATION OF BOMBERS - DAY
</b>
tThese planes are different -- high altitude bombers with
tthree-man crews, high above the harbor.  The bombardier looks
tthrough his sight and the bomb bays open.

tTHROUGH THE BOMBARDIER'S SIGHT, the ships look like tops, far
tbelow.  The bombardier is ticking off the targets as they
tpass, the first two he mentions already burning.

<b>tttttJAPANESE BOMBARDIER
</b>tttWest Virginia... Oklahoma... Ah, Arizona.

tHe flips his bomb switch, and a HUGE STEEL BOMB falls away.

<b>tEXT.  THE FLIGHT OF THE BOMB - DAY
</b>
tWe stay with the bomb as it falls through the sky.  The small
tpropeller on the bomb's nose spins in the air, running the
tarming mechanism into the bomb's explosive core.  The bomb
twobbles a bit at first, but then as it gathers speed its fins
tstabilize it, and it falls faster and faster, at a dizzying
trate, toward the Arizona.

tIt slams through the teak wood deck, and breaks it like
tmatchsticks.

tIt's tremendous weight and speed carry it through the next
tdeck, and the next, deep into the heart of the ship...toward
tthe powder room, where two million pounds of black powder are
twaiting.

tThe bomb hits there, and the explosion is almost beyond
tcomprehension.  Over 1400 men die instantly.

<b>tEXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY
</b>
tThe battleship Arizona leaps into the air, the ship's spine
tis broken, it's guts ripped open in one explosive instant.
tMen on the deck are thrown into the burning oil already
tfloating on the water from the other ruptured ships, but
tthere are almost no survivors.

tThe concussion of the explosion blows men off the repair ship
tVestal, next to the Arizona, saving Vestal, as the explosion
tsnuffs out the fires on Vestal; it also sends tons of debris
tdown on her decks -- parts of the ship, legs, arms and heads
tof men, all sorts of bodies.

tDebris from the Arizona also cover the Tennessee and does
tmore damage than the two Japanese bombs that hit her.

tthe Arizona go up.

tFor a moment she's frozen, then she actually sees the shock
twave traveling across the bay and through the trees like an

tso awesome it freezes him for a moment.

tA Zero comes up behind him, firing.  Danny jerks his stick to
tmaneuver but he's caught...

tRafe comes in behind the Zero, chopping it up, even as he
tyells at Danny over the radio --

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttAin't no time for spectatin'!

tThey turn back after the line of Zeros.  There are some
tJapanese planes coming after them now, but the P-40's head at
ttheir noses, firing, then duck past in a double maneuver, and
tturn right back into the Japanese formation.

tshort burst before stopping.

<b>tttttRAFE
</b>tttI'm out of ammo!

ta crash.

tStill, even IN THE CHAOS ON THE SHIPS, the sailors struggle
tto survive, inventively.  Men trapped on one burning ship use
tthe severed barrel of a five-inch naval gun as a bridge to

tRoosevelt places his hands on the arms of his wheelchair, and

twaves them off.  With inhuman physical effort, that has his

tThere are also coffins covered in Japanese flags, their
tdrowned fliers being treated now with respect.

tEveryone is in their best uniforms.  The pilots -- Rafe,
tDanny, and the other guys -- are looking at Billy's coffin;
tEvelyn, next to Danny, on his appropriate side is looking at
tone that belongs to Betty.  So is Red; he's grieving.

<b>tttttMINISTER
</b>ttt...Where is God in this?  Our enemies
tttbelieve a divine wind protects them.  We
tttsee our friends laid out before us, and

tRafe and Evelyn exchange a glance, past Danny.

tAs the mourners disperse, Evelyn puts a lei on Betty's

</b>tttI told her not to come.

tThe Major, watching the fueling, gets a wave from the ground
tcrew and turns and motions to Rafe and Danny that they're
tready.  They pick up their duffel bags -- and then Evelyn
tcomes around the corner of the shelter.

tRafe sees her first, but stops and looks away as Danny moves
tto her.  For a moment he studies her eyes, and she does not
tlook away.

tHe takes her into his arms, kisses her tenderly but briefly,
ta final time.  Evelyn's eyes find Rafe, but he can't look at

tDanny's hand gropes to his throat; Rafe finds a V shaped
tshard of the fuselage hooked into his neck.

tRafe grabs it, trying to bend it open; the sharp metal cuts
this hands, but he keeps straining.  It won't work, He pulls
this .45 from his jacket and tries to pry the metal.  It works
ta bit; he tosses the pistol aside and grabs the shard again,
tand opens it.

tRafe's head snaps forward, crunched with the butt of a rifle;
ta Japanese patrol, four men, have arrived.  They're angry,
tscared, hyped.  They knock Red down too, yelling and
tbrandishing their rifles at the fliers on the beach, living
tand dead.

tThe Japanese officer is barking orders.  They find the
tCaptain's insignia on Danny's jacket, and begin binding him
tto a yoke, his wrists tied to the wood like a crucifixion, a
twire around his neck.  They find the navigator unconscious,
tbut alive.  The officer snaps a single word and a soldier
tshoots the navigator.

tThe others wire Rafe's ankles together... Rafe is
temotionless.

tRAFE'S CONSCIOUSNESS fades in and out.  He hears Danny
tchoking, and his mind sees Danny as a boy those long years
tago, being carried by the neck across the field by his
tfather...

tThen Rafe sees THE PRESENT:  Danny being half-carried, half-
tdragged by the neck by two Japanese.  The officer is pulling
tRed along, hands bound behind him.  And Rafe starts moving,
tbeing dragged on his back, pulled by his feet along the rocky
tsand.

tHis hand slides by the pistol he tossed behind the rock.

tThe whole world slows down.

tHe clutches it, shoots one of the men towing Danny.  And as
tthe man dragging Rafe turns around, Rafe shoots him in the
tface.

tThe officer spins, raising his rifle; the soldier pulling
tRed, shoves him onto his face in the sand and aims his rifle
ttoo.  The officer is pulling the trigger to kill Rafe when
tDanny slams him down from behind.

tThe fourth soldier shoots Danny in the gut, then takes aim
tfor Rafe's heart -- and is shot through the chest from
tbehind.

tThe Japanese officers rises in surprise and is cut down by
tscythes carried by the Chinese peasant soldiers who are just
tarriving.

tRafe struggles to Danny, moving the Chinese aside.  Danny
tlies on his back, clutching his wound as if to hold onto his
tlife.

tttYou're gonna be a father.

tDid Danny hear?  His eyes are closed again.  But his head
