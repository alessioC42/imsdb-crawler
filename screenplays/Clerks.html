<b>tINT: BEDROOM. EARLY-MORNING HOURS
</b>
tA DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed.

tA CLOCK reads twenty to six.

tA SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno,
tBeyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark
tKnight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs
taskew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the
tcorner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly
tatop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a
tresounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR
tswings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE
trings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking
tit off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his
tback to the camera, phone in hand.

<b>ttttFIGURE
</b>ttt(groggily)
ttHello...What?...No, I don't work
tttoday...I'm playing hockey at two.

tTHE DOG yawns and shakes its head.

<b>ttttFIGURE (O.C.)
</b>ttWhy don't you call Randal?...
ttBecause I'm fucking tired....I just
ttclosed last night....
ttt(deep sigh)
ttJesus...What time are you going to
ttcome in?...Twelve...Be there be
tttwelve?...Swear...

tA PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is
tdecorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache.

<b>ttttFIGURE (O.C.)
</b>ttSwear you'll be in by twelve and
ttI'll do it....Twelve...Twelve or I
ttwalk.

tTHE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE
tslowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair
tand stands.

tTHE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The
tRumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It
tis the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is
tDante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttNext time, I get the bed.

<b>tttttttttt2.
</b>

tHe releases the dog and sits up.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttt(exhausted)
ttShit.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT: BATHROOM. MINUTES LATER
</b>
tA steaming shower fills the room. The dog licks water from
tthe toilet.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT: KITCHEN. MINUTES LATER
</b>
tA towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside. He
tgrabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT: KITCHEN. SECONDS LATER
</b>
tChocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. One scoop, two
tscoops, three scoops, four scoops.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT: BEDROOM. A MINUTE LATER
</b>
tDANTE gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet
tfor some clothes. Some chocolate milk spills on the floor.
tTHE DOG laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT: HALLWAY. MINUTES LATER
</b>
tDANTE'S feet are hastily covered. A hand grabs keys from
tatop a VCR.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT: DRIVEWAY. MINUTES LATER
</b>
tA car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tttttttttt3.
</b>

<b>tEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
tThe car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground
tfrom the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
tDANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. He opens
tit and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the
tstore.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
tA very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the
tlights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the
tconvenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the
tcamera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a
tknife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack
tremains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot.
tGround coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in
tthe coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes
tto life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY
tPARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of
tpapers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls
this eyes as it occurs to him.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttShit.

tThe register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
<b>tPOV: NEWSPAPER MACHINE
</b>
tThrough murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE
tapproach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls
tthe door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he
treaches toward the camera.

tDANTE pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press
tvending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand
tas he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but
tthe sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops
thim. He takes a step back to grab the coin.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tttttttttt4.
</b>

<b>tINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
tThe papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding
tflop. The quarter drops back into the register drawer.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
tDANTE tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock. He
tlooks down at it.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttShit!

tThe lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and
tobtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted.
tDANTE looks around and kicks the shutter angrily. The car
ttrunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a
tfolded white sheet.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
tA can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf. DANTE dips
this fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on
tthe unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
tDANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the
tsheet under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I
tASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to
<b>tOPEN.
</b>
<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING
</b>
tThe clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the
tmorning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then
tdrops his head in his hands. The day has begun.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

tThe store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim
tmorning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by.

tDANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttThanks. Have a good one.

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttDo you mind if I drink this here?

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttSure. Go ahead.

tThe ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee.
tAnother CUSTOMER leans in the door.

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttAre you open?

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttPack of cigarettes.

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttAre you sure?

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttAm I sure?

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttAre you sure?

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttAm I sure about what?

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttDo you really want to buy those
ttcigarettes?

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttAre you serious?

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttHow long have you been smoking?

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttt(to DANTE)
ttWhat is this, a poll?

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttBeats me.

<b>tttttttttt6.
</b>

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttHow long have you been a smoker?

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttSince I was thirteen.

tThe ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens
tit and extracts a sickly-looking lung model.

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttI'd say you're about nineteen,
tttwenty, am I right?

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttWhat the hell is that?

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttThat's your lung. By this time,
ttyour lung looks like this.

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttYou're shittin' me.

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttYou think I'm shitting you...

tThe ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase.

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttWhat's this?

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttIt's a trach ring. It's what they
ttinstall in your throat when throat
ttcancer takes your voice box. This
ttone came out of a sixty-year-old man.

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttt(drops ring)
ttUnnhh!

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttt(picks up the ring)
ttHe smoked until the day he died.
ttUsed to put the cigarette in this
ttthing and smoke it that way.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttExcuse me, but...

<b>tttttttttt7.
</b>

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttThis is where you're heading. A
ttcruddy lung, smoking through a hole
ttin your throat. Do you really want
ttthat?

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttWell, if it's already too late...

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttIt's never too late. Give those
ttcigarettes back now, and buy some
ttgum instead.
ttt(grabs nearby pack, reads)
ttHere. Chewlies Gum. Try this.

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttIt's not the same.

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttIt's cheaper than cigarettes. And
ttit certainly beats this.

tHands him a picture.

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttJesus!

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttIt's a picture of a cancer-ridden
ttlung. Keep it.

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttt(to DANTE)
ttI'll just take the gum.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttFifty-five.

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttYou've made a wise choice. Keep up
ttthe good work.

tThe CUSTOMER exits.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttMaybe you should take that coffee
ttoutside.

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttNo, I think I'll drink it in here,
ttthanks.

<b>tttttttttt8.
</b>

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttIf you're going to drink it in
tthere, I'd appreciate it if you'd
ttnot bother the customers.

</b>ttOkay. I'm sorry about that.

tAnother CUSTOMER comes up to the counter.

tA blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT
tBOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of
tSILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam
tdance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB.

<b>ttttJAY

tA SMALL CROWD gathers around the ACTIVIST as he orates. It

</b>ttYou're spending what? Twenty,

<b>ttttLISTENER 1
</b>ttForty.

<b>ttttLISTENER 2
</b>ttFifty-three.

</b>ttFifty-three dollars. Would you pay

ttto kill you? Because that's what
ttyou're doing now, by paying for the
ttso-called privilege to smoke!

<b>ttttLISTENER 3
</b>ttWe all gotta go sometime...

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttIt's that kind of mentality that
ttallows this cancer-producing
ttindustry to thrive. Of course we're
ttall going to die someday, but do we
tthave to pay for it? Do we have to
ttactually throw hard-earned dollars
tton a counter and say, "Please,
ttplease, Mister Merchant of Death,

ttwill give me bad breath, stink up
ttmy clothes, and fry my lungs."

<b>ttttLISTENER 1

</b>

<b>ttttACTIVIST (CONT'D)
</b>ttFriends, let me tell you about
ttanother bunch of hate mongers that
ttwere just following orders: they
ttwere called Nazis, and they
ttpractically wiped a nation of
ttpeople from the Earth...just like
ttcigarettes are doing now! Cigarette
ttsmoking is the new Holocaust, and
ttthose that partake in the practice
ttof smoking or sell the wares that
ttpromote it are the Nazis of the

ttYeah, now shut up so he can speak!

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttOh, he's scared now! He sees the

<b>ttttttttt12.
</b>

<b>ttttLISTENER 3
</b>ttYeah!

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttWe'd rather chew our gum than

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttThat's it, everybody out.

<b>ttttACTIVIST
</b>ttWe're not moving! We have a right,

tThe small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face.

<b>ttttCROWD
</b>ttCancer merchant! Cancer merchant!
ttCancer merchant!

tVERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws
tcigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a
tloud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the
tthrong. Everyone turns to face...

tVERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding
ta fire extinguisher.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttWho's leading this mob?

tThe CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C.

<b>ttttSOMEONE
</b>ttThat guy.

tThe ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward

<b>ttttVERONICA (O.C.)
</b>ttFreeze.

tVERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of
tthe extinguisher on the ACTIVIST.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttLet's see some credentials.

tHe reaches into his briefcase. She pokes the extinguisher
tnozzle at him, warningly.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttSlowly...

tHe pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads
tit.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttYou're a Chewlie's Gum

tHe nods.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttAnd you're stirring up all this

ttto...what?...sell more gum?

tHe nods again.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttt(through gritted teeth)
ttGet out of here.

tHe quickly flees. She blasts him with more chemical as he
texits.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttt(to the crowd)
ttAnd you people: Don't you have jobs
ttto go to? Get out of here and go
ttcommute.

tThe CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic

tVERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttYou oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
ttEasily led automatons. Try thinking
ttfor yourself before you pelt and

tThe last of the crowd exits. VERONICA sets the fire
textinguisher down next to DANTE. DANTE is sitting on the
tfloor, head in his folded arms.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttIt looked like Tiananmen Square in
tthere for a second.

tDANTE is silent.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>tt"Thank you, Veronica; you saved me

tDANTE remains silent.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttt(sits beside him)
ttOkay, champ. What's wrong?

tDANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look.

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttAll right, stupid question. But

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttToo hard?! I don't have enough

<b>ttttVERONICA
</b>ttAt least they weren't lit.

<b>ttttDANTE

</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttRANDAL
</b>ttThen wouldn't that logically mean
ttthat it's a theocracy? If the head
ttof the Empire is a priest of some

ttthe government is therefore one

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttIt would stand to reason, yes.

</b>ttHence, the Empire was a fascist

ttStar was manned by the Imperial
ttarmy-storm troopers, dignitaries-
ttthe only people onboard were
ttImperials.

</b>ttA construction job of that magnitude

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttNot just Imperials, is what you're

</b>ttI don't know. You going to lock the
ttvideo store?

tThe sign on the door reads:

<b>tTEMPORARILY CLOSED. BE OPEN AFTER FIRST PERIOD.
</b>
tThe PLAYERS ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one.
tON THE ROOF they jump off the ladder and skate around. More
tplayers join them.

<b>ttttttttt72.
</b>

tFrom across the street we get the full, odd perspective: a
tstore with many men gliding around on the roof.

tOn the roof DANTE skates and passes with another player.
tREDDING stretches, leaning against the sign. RANDAL pulls
this mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. SANFORD
tskates in and takes a shot, which RANDAL blocks. JAY and
tSILENT BOB deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge
tand JAY throws up a dime bag. DANTE holds a ball in the
tcenter of the court.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttReady?

tPLAYERS take positions. SANFORD comes to the center and
tholds the ball in drop position. DANTE and REDDING face off,
tand the ball is in play.

tThe game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet.
tFaces are smashed with sticks, slide tackles are made, shots
tare taken, CU's of various players included.

tINACTIVE PLAYERS call out encouragement and slander from the
tsidelines. More game playing including both goalies getting
tscored on and more face-offs.

tBelow, a CUSTOMER tugs on the convenience store door. He
treads the sign and then backs up into the street, attempting
tto peer over the ledge. Above, the game continues.

tBelow, the CUSTOMER shifts from one foot to the other
timpatiently. He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends.

tAbove, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of
tthe customer peek. Skating feet pass rapidly before him, and
the watches for a moment before calling out.

tface against the glass.

</b>ttThat's easy to say from over here.

</b>ttGive me a stick, pretty boy! I'll

tA new face-off pits DANTE against the CUSTOMER. The ball
tdrops between the two and DANTE gets flattened. The CUSTOMER
twinds up and takes a hard shot. The ball sails off the
tcourt, through the air, and into a faraway yard. DANTE calls
tto the sidelines.

</b>ttGive me another ball.

ttSo I'm no more responsible for my

ttwork than, say, the Death Squad

tRANDAL spits a mist of water at the customer, drenching him.
tThe man reacts violently, attempting to grab RANDAL from

ttWhat the fuck did you do that for?

</b>ttIf title dictated my behavior, as a

</b>ttSounds to me like somebody needs to
tthit the gym.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttTRAINER
</b>ttI heard you strain when you put the

ttweighs about seven pounds.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttI didn't strain. I sighed.

<b>ttttTRAINER
</b>ttI don't think so. That was a grunt;
tta deep inhalation of oxygen to aid
ttin the stretching of muscles. I'm a
tttrainer. I know what that sound
ttsignifies: you're out of shape.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttI don't think so.

<b>ttttTRAINER
</b>ttOh, I do. You made the same noise
ttwhen you reached across the counter
ttfor my cash. Your muscles are thin
ttand sadly underutilized.

</b>ttThey are not.

<b>ttttTRAINER
</b>ttYes, they are. You're out of shape.

</b>ttHey man, that was a long time ago.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttJesus, you're caustic.

ttabout hugging you...you know, you
ttbeing a guy and all. Just don't
ttknead my ass when you do it.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttGet the fuck outta here already.

<b>ttttRANDAL
</b>ttI'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

tRANDAL exits. A second later, he reenters and tosses DANTE
tthe sheet-sign.

<b>ttttRANDAL
</b>ttYou're closed.

tHe exits. DANTE pushes the sign over from Open to Closed.

tDANTE climbs behind the counter. He pops the register open
tand starts counting the drawer out. The door is heard opening.

tPOV JOHN: DANTE counting out the register, not looking up.

<b>ttttDANTE
</b>ttWhat'd you forget something?
ttt(looks up, surprised)
ttOh. I'm sorry, we're closed.

tA gunshot blasts out. DANTE flies back, his chest exploding.
tHe stares ahead and slumps to the floor.

tJOHN walks behind the counter, stepping over DANTE'S body on
tthe floor, and takes the money out of the register. He grabs
ta paper bag and jams the money in it. He grabs handfuls of
tchange, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the
tframe. DANTE continues to lie on the floor.

<b>tCREDITS
</b>
tCredits end, and the door is heard opening. A customer comes
tto the counter and stands there. He waits, looks around for
ta clerk, looks down the aisles.

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttHello? Little help?

<b>ttttttttt144.
</b>

tNo reply. He looks around again, and glances at the door to
tmake sure nobody's coming in. Then he reaches behind the
tcounter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. He leaves.
