<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tA SPECK OF DUST
</b>
tGrains of sand dance in the wind.  As we glide over a VAST
tDESERT, the speck of dust becomes a HORSE AND RIDER. 
tCATHERINE YOUNG straddles the beautiful black animal, her
tmesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon.  A curious breeze
tblows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in, as if
tthe wind itself were telling something to her...

tCatherine sees a FLICKERING LIGHT in the sand.  She pulls the
treins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into
tnothingness.  She dismounts, affectionately scratches the
thorse's neck, and follows the LIGHT.  When she looks over her
tshoulder, the Arabian is now a child's WOODEN HOBBY HORSE. 
tNot surprised, Catherine smiles and walks down a dune, sand
tsliding beneath her feet...

tShe finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed,
tgnarled limbs appear to form hands.  The light dances across
ther face.  She shades her eyes and pinpoints the source...

tA SMALL MIRROR reflecting rays of bright sun, housed within a
tlocket and chain.  It's held by EDWARD, a haunted-looking boy
tof seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes.  He sits
ton a fallen tree trunk, patiently waiting for her arrival.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttThanks for the horse.

tHe's a shy child, yet comfortable with Catherine.

<b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttYou liked him?

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttHe's beautiful...

tEdward smiles, delighted he made her happy.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttBut I thought we were going sailing.

tThe boy frowns.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou promised.

tA devilish glint in his eye, Edward redirects the mirror. 
tCatherine follows the flicker to a TOY BOAT in the sand.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe can't fit into that!

tEdward shines light in her eyes, momentarily blinding her,
tthen snaps the locket shut.  When her vision clears,
tCatherine sees a GIANT SHIP perched among the dunes.  A craft
tweighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttThat'll do.

tShe walks toward it, but Edward doesn't follow.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(coaxing him)
ttCome on, Mister E.

tShe extends her hand, but he adamantly shakes his head no.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhat now?

<b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttt(nods at the ship)
tt's broken.

tUndaunted, she... finds herself standing on the DECK.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttt(calling to him)
ttWho says?

<b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttMocky-Lock.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttOh no... No you don't.

<b>ttttEDWARD
</b>tt"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock
ttwants me where I am."

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttI bet we can fix it.

tShe opens a rusted iron DOOR.  It makes an HORRIFIC
tSCREECHING SOUND.  Similar to metal-on-metal, but more
tpiercing, more pained.  As if made by a living thing.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(familiar with the noise, a
tttwarning to him)
ttEd-ward...

tThe boy's FACE CONTORTS, turning into something half-human,
thalf-animal.  A monster.  Mocky-Lock.  He SCREECHES, trying
tto frighten Catherine, but she cocks her head...

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe agreed.  No more Mocky-Lock.

tThe creature sticks its tongue out and DIVES.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttEdward!

tBut it's too late!  Edward/Mocky Lock slithers into the sand
tand disappears.  Resigning herself to a failure, she opens
tthe palm of her left hand, revealing a SMALL BUMP in the
tflesh between thumb and forefinger.  She presses hard and...

<b>tPICTURE AND SOUND DISTORT AND CHANGE
</b>
<b>tINT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
tWe are looking at a large SCREEN showing an electronically
tgenerated three-dimensional view of a human brain featuring
tcolor-coded neurological activity.  In a specific section of
tthe image, cells flash from yellow to red...

tPULL BACK TO REVEAL HENRY WEST surrounded by computers,
tmonitors, electronics, and keyboards.  DR. MIRIAM KENT stands
tbefore a peculiar diagnostic machine scrutinizing data and
timages.  Both wear garb favored by surgeons or microchip
tassemblers.  The impressive, weird computer system HUMS as it
tshifts programs, the unusual brain image changing colors.  

tTHROUGH A LARGE WINDOW, we see into an ADJOINING ROOM within
twhich a HUMAN FIGURE hangs suspended in mid-air by a series
tof cables designed to simulate flotation.

tAT THE CONSOLE, Miriam uses a pen to hit specific areas of
tthe touch-sensitive screen, changing the complex CHEMICAL
tSYMBOLS displayed there.

tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, a series of pharmaceuticals are
tinjected into an intravenous tube feeding the sleeve/arm of
tthe figure.  A featherweight cloth MASK electronically rises,
trevealing the sleeping face of Catherine.

tAT THE CONSOLE, Miriam hits a button and speaks into an
tintercom microphone.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttSing a song of sixpence...

tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, there is no reaction from Catherine.

<b>ttttMIRIAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>ttSing a song of sixpence...

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttt(hoarse, groggy)
ttA pocketful of rye...

<b>ttttMIRIAM (O.S.)
</b>ttFour-and-twenty blackbirds.

tCatherine's eyes open.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttBaked in a pie...

tIN THE CONTROL ROOM, Henry hits a switch and Catherine is
tlowered to the pedestal.  Miriam checks Monitors displaying
tCatherine's vital signs and continuing what must be a
troutine, presses numbers on a keypad to open the PRESSURIZED
tAIRTIGHT DOOR separating the two areas.

tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, lights come on and Miriam eases
tCatherine out of the apparatus.  She checks her pupil
tdilation, pulse, throat, and reflexes.  She pokes and prods
twith a familiarity that would seem rude to an outside
tobserver, but is nothing to them.  Getting to her feet, we
tsee that Catherine's BODYSUIT is made of an unusual dark
tfabric almost liquid in consistency.

tAT THE CONSOLE, Henry moves to another section and for the
tfirst time, we see there are two elaborate neural monitors. 
tAnd the "brain" pictured here is smaller.  Younger...

<b>ttttHENRY
</b>tt"Mister E." is doing fine.

tREVEAL A SECOND FIGURE suspended from the ceiling in the
tPROCEDURE ROOM.  A SMALL BOY is lowered to the pedestal and
tas Miriam records data, Catherine removes the child's "mask,"
tdisplaying the haunted face of Edward.  Clearly, the boy is
tin some kind of catatonic state.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttDid we go sailing?

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttAlmost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>tt"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock
ttwants me where I am."

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttMocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.

tHenry communicates with them via the intercom.

<b>ttttHENRY
</b>ttWhere did that come from again?

tCatherine looks annoyed - How could he forget?

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttA nursery rhyme.

tCatherine detaches the cables and eases Edward's frail body
tinto a waiting wheelchair.  Miriam takes a penlight and
texamines the boy's eyes... An emotionless void, oddly
tbeautiful.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttt(thinking aloud)
ttNursery rhymes, fairy tales, the
ttbogeyman... All preparation for the
tthorrors of the real world.

tMaking certain the child is comfortable, Catherine covers him
twith a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him
tinto the CONTROL ROOM, accompanied by Miriam.  Henry types in
ta command and moves to join them.

<b>ttttHENRY
</b>ttAnybody hungry?  I'm hungry...

tA BUZZER sounds and ANOTHER DOOR HISSES OPEN... A constantly
tfretting administrator, BARRY COOPERMAN, is waiting for them
tin the corridor.

<b>ttttCOOPERMAN
</b>ttEdward's parents are here.

tWe can see it in Catherine's face - this isn't good news.

<b>tEXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY
</b>
tSituated in a corporate/industrial area north of San Diego,
tCalifornia, a series of well-secured buildings form a mini
tcompound.  A sign near the gate reads CAMPBELL CENTER - A
<b>tDIVISION OF SUNERSET INDUSTRIES.
</b>
<b>tINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
tAlthough this is a hospital room filled with medical
tequipment, its sterility has been camouflaged with toys,
tposters, photographs, and drawings to make it more "homey." 
t(Some hint at aspects of Edward's fantasy world).  Every
tcomfort has been provided and no expense spared.

tHenry, Miriam, and Catherine, now wearing funky/casual
tclothes under a lab coat, stand opposite Cooperman.  Sitting
ton the bed with Edward is ELLA BAINES, an elegantly dressed
twoman in her mid-40's.  There is a soulfulness to her, but
tthe husband, LUCIEN BAINES, 60's, possesses the icy demeanor
tof a corporate tycoon.  One might write him off as cold, but
twe sense a genuine love for his wife and child.  Ella smiles
tand caresses Edward's hair.

<b>ttttELLA
</b>ttHe needs a haircut.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttI'll tell the nurse.
ttt(sensing something in Edward)
ttGod, he loves when you visit.

<b>ttttELLA
</b>ttMy husband wonders if that's true.
ttt(delivering bad news)
ttHe wants to place Edward in a hospital.

tSeeing an unfunded future, Henry's ready to disassociate
thimself from Miriam and Catherine...

<b>ttttHENRY
</b>ttThere are other applications for the
ttscanner, Mr. Baines...

<b>ttttLUCIEN
</b>ttI realize that, Henry...
ttt(to Miriam)
ttAnd I know your work, Dr. Kent, is
ttinvaluable to this company...

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttYou don't know about me, though, do you?

<b>ttttLUCIEN
</b>ttCatherine, we've waited eighteen months
ttfor signs of progress...

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttThere's been progress.

<b>ttttLUCIEN
</b>ttYes, but there is no proof the procedure
ttworks.  All I have is a belief that your
ttinteraction with my son is not a
tthallucination.

tCatherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the
tintensity of her experience with Edward, but feels she must
tdefend herself.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttt(to Cooperman, Miriam, Henry)
ttYou picked me, remember?  And I took the
ttjob.  Gladly.  This is the next wave and
ttI want to be part of it...

<b>ttttCOOPERMAN
</b>ttNo one is doubting your ability.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttThen what is it?

tIntrospective and solemn-eyed, Lucien takes a moment, then:

<b>ttttLUCIEN
</b>ttI've invested millions of dollars in
ttthis study... And I've convinced others
ttto do the same.  I suppose I should feel
ttresponsible to them, but I don't.  I
ttcould care less if they see a profit. 
ttI'm responsible to my boy, that's all
ttthat matters.
ttt(looks her in the eye)
ttYou tell me... Am I doing the right
ttthing?

<b>tOFF CATHERINE'S FACE...
</b>
<b>tINT. WHITE ROOM - DAY
</b>
tAt first, we're not sure where we are or what's happening. 
tIt's too bright, the space confining.  As our eyes adjust, we
tseem to be in a bathroom or shower stall.  We HEAR a WOMAN
tCRYING and the camera finds ANNE VICKSEY.  Dark circles
tbeneath eyes red and puffy from crying.  Hair wet and ratted. 
tSweater and pants damp and stained.  Barefoot, she shivers
tfrom cold and fear...

tPULL BACK to show more of her surroundings.  The white-tiled
t10' x 8' room features a SHOWER HEAD, TOILET, and a push
tbutton SPIGOT for drinking water.  Two walls are SOLID, the
tother two MIRRORED, the glass covered by thick clear plastic.

tThe floor is littered with empty food wrappers - candy bars,
tjuice boxes.  In the center of the floor is a DRAIN and above
ther, on the ceiling, a FLUORESCENT LAMP, also encased in
tclear plastic.

tThere is no door.

tA mechanism CLICKS. Then a RUMBLING... Anne seems to know
twhat's coming.  She presses against the wall, removes her
tarms from the sleeves of the sweater, hunches down, and
traises the garment over her head, forming a tent.

tWATER ERUPTS from the shower head.  There is no steam, so
tthis water must be cold.  Shaking, Anne whispers a count to
therself - "One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three..." and
tso on.  The spray hits everything in the room - mirror,
ttoilet, floor - and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain.

<b>ttttANNE
</b>ttThirty.

tShe peeks up from the tent, but the water has not stopped,
tand that isn't what she expected.  We hear a soft SUCKING
tNOISE and a CLICK.  The wrapper rises on a puddle of water. 
tAnne POUNDS her fist on the wall.

<b>ttttANNE (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(angry, scared)
<b>ttTHIRTY!
</b>
tA puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has
tsomehow been sealed shut.  Her panic intensifies as we hear
tanother CLICK and the water pressure increases.

<b>tINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
tIn the darkened procedure room, Miriam finds Catherine
tstanding between the two suspension devices, alone.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttYou okay?

tCatherine turns, nods, and tries to smile.  Has she been
tcrying?  Miriam steps further into the room.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttHe hates me.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttLucien Baines?

tCatherine nods.

<b>ttttMIRIAM (CONT'D)
</b>ttI wouldn't say "hates."  Dislikes,
ttdistrusts, maybe.

tCatherine laughs.  Exactly what Miriam wanted.

<b>ttttMIRIAM (CONT'D)
</b>ttShe adores you.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttShe thinks I can bring Edward back.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttSomeday you can.  We all believe that...

tCatherine halfheartedly nods, but her mind is elsewhere,
tfocused on the two apparatuses.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttI want to try it.  Please.

tMiriam knows what this is about.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttWe've been over this a dozen times.  No.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttWhy not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What
ttharm could it do?

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttI don't want to find out.

tEver the doctor, Miriam finds herself surreptitiously
texamining Catherine's eyes, flesh tone, a slight trembling in
ther fingertips.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttWhy is it taking so long for us to reach
tthim?  Because we've been reactive,
ttthat's why.  And we need to be active.

tMiriam reaches for Catherine's wrist and takes her pulse.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(annoyed)
ttMiriam...

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttShush.

tAs Miriam examines her, Catherine continues:

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttHe creates the obstacles, he decides
ttwhich games to play.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttI've heard this argument before.  It's
ttnot happening.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttt(frustrated)
ttIt could take years for me to get past
ttthe barriers he's created.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttIf we reverse the feed and bring Edward
ttinto your mind, it could be devastating
ttfor him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly
ttexisting in a whole other world.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttI do it all the time!

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttYes, but, you're a willing participant. 
ttPicture Edward in a strange place, lost,
ttfrightened...

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttI'd be there for him.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttAnd he might blame you for terrifying
tthim.  That one moment could erase all
ttyou've accomplished.  And if that
tthappened, the trust he has in you is
ttgone.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttt(defeated)
ttOkay, okay...

tMiriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttBesides, I don't know what it might do
ttto you.  You're already exhausted.
ttt(concerned)
ttHave you been sleeping?

tCatherine nods.

<b>ttttMIRIAM (CONT'D)
</b>ttI can prescribe something...

tCatherine shakes her head no.  Miriam shuts off the penlight
tand looks at Catherine with professional and personal
tconcern.

<b>ttttMIRIAM (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou're sure?  Any more nightmares?

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttt(defensively)
ttNo.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttGood.  We need you healthy and relaxed. 
ttYou're going to eat well, meditate,
ttexercise, and watch mindless television.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttYes mother.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttI don't want you up all night reading
ttEdward's case file of the nine millionth
tttime.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. 
ttLeave the work here.

tShe taps Catherine's head.

<b>ttttMIRIAM (CONT'D)
</b>ttDon't bring it home in this.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttOkay.

tMiriam gathers her belongings.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttHenry wants me to try this Vietnamese
ttplace he's wild about.  Want to come?

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttt(declining)
ttI've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I
ttwant to get to bed early.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttThat's my girl.

tMiriam exits, but Catherine remains, still curious what could
thappen if things were reversed.

<b>tINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tThe corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home.  At
tthe NURSES STATION, a staff member observes the child on a
tclosed-circuit monitor.  Further down the hall, Miriam and
tHenry exit.  Wearing a (chic) thrift store coat and lugging a
tworn book bag, Catherine stands outside Edward's room,
twatching him sleep.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttPleasant dreams, Mister E.

<b>tEXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
tA GREEN FORD PICK-UP TRUCK cruises down this deserted stretch
tof two-lane blacktop, the driver carefully maintaining the
tspeed limit.  He signals and exits...

<b>tEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</b>
tThe truck rumbles along a stretch of bumpy, unpaved road. 
tThe area is desolate, depressing, and deserted.  It feels
tlike no one's been anywhere near here for years.  The pick-up
tstops at a RUSTED GATE and the DRIVER, a tall, lean, sinewy
tfellow undoes a combination lock-and-chain.  We do not yet
tsee his face.

<b>tEXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tThe truck parks inside a charred barn, now hidden from view,
tand the driver steps out, followed by his DOG.

tA magnificent WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD.  We notice a GLINT in
tits BLUE EYES - the animal's an albino.  The driver points
tand whistles.  Well-trained, the Shepard sprints to the gate
tand waits, keeping a watchful eye on the road.

<b>tINT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
tFrom the outside, a passerby would never know this sanctuary
texisted.  Within the foundation of a farm building never
tcompleted, we find a small room in the center of a much
tlarger space.  The cell.  We hear the WHIR of ELECTRONIC
tEQUIPMENT and notice VIDEO CAMERAS mounted on tripods pointed
tat the two-way glass.  We follow CABLES to a massive VIDEO
tRECORDER - the type used in surveillance, able to record for
tdays without maintenance, and an elaborate TIMING DEVICE
tconnected to a series of VALVES and SWITCHES.

tAs if in a beatific trance, the driver moves to the window
tand gently rests his palm on the glass.  ANNE MOVES!  Arms
tflailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread.  The last
tspark of life... The driver JUMPS, startled and frightened.

tAlmost shamefully, he turns and hides, unable to look at her. 
tSuddenly, his body tenses and writhes, as if seized by
ttorturous pain.  He opens his mouth in a silent scream.

tAnd then, quickly as it came, the pain subsides.  Hidden in
tshadow, he breathes deeply, regaining self-control.  He
twaits, then moves back to the glass.  Anne's dead face floats
tpast him.  Almost angelic.  He watches her and leans his head
tagainst the window, closer.  And the driver catches his own
treflection in the mirror.

tMeet CARL STARGHER.

<b>tEXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tSmall and isolated, the nearest neighbor a block away.

<b>tINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe place is a mess.  Computer print-outs, dirty dishes,
tunopened mail, videotapes, and notepads cover tables, chairs
tand floor.  On the crammed bookshelves, psychology texts sit
tnext to volumes on mythology, religion, and the occult. 
tTotems, figurines and artifacts (Central and South American
tin origin) adorn the walls and tables.

tAs Portishead plays on the stereo, we find Catherine
tsuffering from insomnia, wearing goofy-yet-hip eyeglasses,
tsweatpants and a UCSD T-shirt, sharing a late-night snack
twith her pet CAT.  She shuts the refrigerator door and we
tlinger on an odd POSTCARD taped to the surface.  A kitschy
tpostcard of a warrior/goddess.

<b>tINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tWe MOVE out of shadow, toward a bright focused light,
tfollowing the albino German Shepherd - VALENTINE - as it
tenters a VAST SUBTERRANEAN ROOM.  Most of the walls have been
tknocked down, leaving only thick support posts.  Valentine
tfinds Stargher in a DUGOUT PIT - about five feet deeper than
tthe rest of the room - polishing a stainless steel table.  A
tbright tungsten work light hangs above, and near it is the
tchain, cables and hooks of a customized MECHANICAL HOIST.

tThe dog picks up an unpleasant scent and follows it to a far
tcorner where there are empty jugs of BLEACH sitting next to a
tlong, deep cast iron TUB.  Stargher WHISTLES and Valentine
tobediently retreats to a KENNEL CAGE.  Stargher gives him a
tchew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub.

tSoaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of Anne Vicksey. 
tThe interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and
tthe whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is
tfloating in nothingness, but what hypnotizes and appalls are
ther eyes.  Wide open, transformed by the chlorine into
tsomething ghostly, they are unforgettable.

tAs the bleach gurgles down the drain, Stargher lifts Anne
tfrom the tub and carries her to the table.  He places her
tface up and dries her with a clean white towel.  He moves her
tlimbs, lips, hips, and hands into desired positions then
tretreats into shadow.  In the harsh light, against the shiny
ttable, the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and
twe almost expect her to move...

tWe HEAR Stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the
tpool of light.  Nude, we see that his lean, muscular frame is
tlaced with some rough tatoos.  When he turns his back to us,
twe find EIGHT METAL RINGS, thick and strong, PIERCED through
this flesh.  Two columns of four on either side of the spine,
trunning from shoulder blade to just below the waist.  What in
tGod's name are they for?

tStargher shuts off the work light and moves to an area where
the keeps TELEVISION MONITORS and VCRs.  He inserts a
tvideocassette taken from the surveillance deck and watches
tthe screen.

tIn BLACK AND WHITE, we see Anne awaken in the cell.  Her
tfirst moments inside.  Disoriented, terrified, trapped, she
texamines her surroundings.

tStargher is mesmerized by her fear.  Fast-forwarding to her
tdeath, he presses a remote and we get SOUND.  Anne screaming,
tbegging for her life.  Aroused, stimulated, Stargher drinks
tit in like a symphony.  Valentine cowers in the back of his
tcage, hating this.

<b>tINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tLying on her bed (a waterbed), Catherine sleepily stares at
tthe ceiling, rolls onto her side, and feels herself drawn
tinto the comforter.  The folds of the fabric become ripples. 
tRipples become dunes.

<b>tEXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY
</b>
tAnd we find ourselves in the DESERT of EDWARD'S WORLD.

tWe fly over dunes and come up behind Catherine as she
tstruggles through waves of sand.  The tree trunk is up ahead
tand we glimpse someone hiding inside.

tCatherine reaches.  MOCKEY-LOCK ERUPTS FROM WITHIN THE TREE
tTRUNK!  SNARLING!  Catherine retreats, silently screaming.

<b>tINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN
</b>
tIN HER OWN BED, Catherine's eyes are open.  In sharp contrast
tto a typical reaction to a nightmare, she remains calm.  No
tsweaty face, no gasp, no reaction at all, really.  She might
tas well have been dreaming of puppy dogs.  Wide awake, her
teyes return their gaze to the ceiling.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttGo.  To.  Sleep.

<b>tINT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tCHAINS attached to bizarre HOOKS dangle from the ceiling. 
tAdmiring Anne's body, Stargher links the hooks to the rings
tin his back.  He presses a remote unit and up in the rafters,
ta series of GEARS click into motion.  The sound is torturous
tas the mechanical hoist LIFTS Stargher off the ground,
tpulling at the rings, strips of flesh rising.  Stargher
tgrimaces, but clearly he wants the pain, needs it.  As the
thoist clicks into another gear, it carries Stargher over the
ttable until his body is perfectly positioned above Anne's.

tIn the flickering weird light of the television screen,
tStargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of
tWilliam Blake - a levitating demon ready to debauch an
tinnocent angel.  With his free hand, he touches himself,
tchains clinking and swaying.

<b>tEXT. RIVER BANK - DAY
</b>
tA railroad bridge and highway span an almost-bone-dry creek
tbed.  Gathered beneath the overpass are the POLICE, CORONER,
tCRIMINIALISTS, AND A LOCAL FBI.  A SEDAN travels down a

tthemselves as FBI and move to the crime scene.

tSpecial Agent GORDON RAMSEY is well-groomed, prides himself
ton professionalism, and follows the Bureau party line. 
tSpecial Agent PETER NOVAK is rough around the edges,
tintrospective, and intense.  A loner who marches to the tune
tof a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with
tprobing eyes.  He moves slowly, observing the scene - the
tworld, for that matter - from a unique perspective.

tAs Ramsey finds the FBI's local liaison - AGENT COLE - Novak
toblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the
tair, and examines road, river, bridge and sky.

<b>ttttRAMSEY
</b>ttWho found her?

tCole nods at a visibly shaken WORKMAN seated in a patrol car.

<b>ttttCOLE
</b>ttSurveyor for the railroad... 'Bout six
ttthis morning.

tNovak sees a FEMALE BODY wrapped in plastic and bound by
twire.  Supervising the examination of the woman is FBI
tPATHOLOGIST DR. THEODORE "TEDDY" LEE, a polite, dapper
tsouthern gentleman.

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttThanks for waiting, Teddy.

tTeddy gives Novak a friendly, respectful salute - "My
tpleasure."  Novak dons gloves, nods to an FBI PHOTOGRAPHER
tand assists Teddy Lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick
tclear plastic.  As the photographer reacts to a strong smell,
tTeddy comments.

<b>ttttTEDDY LEE
</b>ttBleach.

tAs the man snaps pictures, Ramsey and Cole join them.  Sadly,
tNovak recognizes the face.

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttAnne Marie Vicksey.

tWe recognize her, too.

<b>ttttCOLE
</b>ttShe the one from Santa Cruz?

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttJust graduated law school.  Single mom. 
ttHad a two-year-old daughter.

tHe and Teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso, neither
tman surprised.  Coldly thorough, Novak finds another of the
tkiller's tell-tale signs.

tFLASH! Photos are taken.

<b>ttttTEDDY LEE
</b>ttSomeone looking after her little girl?

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttGrandparents.  Live over in Davis.

tNovak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying
tto imagine the horrors she beheld.  He moves to the creek and
tsees only a few inches of water.  His eyes move from the drop
tsite to the highway above.

<b>ttttTEDDY LEE
</b>ttThe poor thing.

tFLASH!  We're up there now, ON THE OVERPASS, with the
tphotographer and Novak, examining TIRE TRACKS in the soft
tshoulder.  Novak peers over the edge at the crime scene,
tsteps back, and focuses on the highway - imagining the
tkiller's truck as it disappeared into the night.

tand the other covers her face with a chloroform-soaked towel. 
tHe presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move.  After a
tbrief struggle, he SHOVES her into her car and holds her
tuntil she passes out.  Stargher pushes Julia into the

tStockwell is behind the wheel, racing down the highway. 
tRamsey's in the passenger seat, Novak in back.  Shotguns and
tbody armor line the cargo area.  Novak's eyes target the FAX,
ta copy of Stargher's license and registration, and the grainy
tdot-matrix image of the suspect's face.  And Novak knows he's
tfound him.

tdozen plain houses at the end of a cul-de-sac.  Bare trees. 
tBrown lawns.  Crows in the air.

tThe house furthest from the main road has a white Ford F250
tpick-up in the driveway.  Green trim.

tTHE SUBURBAN, hidden from Stargher's house, four-wheels it
tthrough a prairie and stops outside the backyard of a
tPRESCHOOL, where two more Suburbans and a van already wait.

<b>tINT. PRESCHOOL - DAY

<b>ttttBROCK
</b>ttGlad you could make it.  We lose the sun
ttin half an hour.

tinto his throat mic.

</b>ttI'm at the back door.

<b>ttttBROCK (V.O.)
</b>ttt(in Ericson's earpiece)
ttCheck the kitchen.

tEricson maneuvers his way to the kitchen window and uses a

<b>ttttERICSON
</b>ttI have a man down.  Repeat, man down.

<b>ttttBROCK (V.O.)

<b>tINT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY
</b>
tRamsey leads Novak into Stargher's "workroom."  It's all
there, the table, the piercing supplies, the bleach.  An odd,
tgrisly collection of DOLLS fills cubby holes in a wooden
tstorage/shelf unit.  Novak's eyes are like a camera,
tdocumenting and storing as much information as possible, but
tit's overwhelming.

tHe moves through the basement.  Careful not to touch
tanything.  He stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks
tsituated over the stainless steel table.  (NOTE: ON THE
<b>tWINCH'S MOTOR IS A WORN PLAQUE READING "CARVER INDUSTRIAL
</b>tEQUIPMENT" with a logo).

tRamsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills
twith images of Anne dying in the cell.

tNovak is painfully, tragically drawn to this.  Although he's
tseen his share of horrific things, Novak is truly disturbed
tby the sight of Anne, desperate to escape, drowning, slowly
tdying, and he knows: This is what will happen to Julia
tHickson unless he finds her.

<b>tINT. THE CELL - NIGHT
</b>
tCLICK.  WATER SPRAYS FROM THE SHOWER.  Caught by surprise,
tJulia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut
toff valve.  Of course, there is none.  Thirty seconds later,
tthe water stops.  Like an animal caught in a trap, Julia's
teyes dart around her "cage."  What kind of hell is this? 
tShivering, she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply
tinto it.  Something's odd about the glass.  Is someone
twatching her?  She bangs on it with her fist.

<b>ttttJULIA
</b>ttHey!

tA HUMAN EYE.  No movement, no deviation of the iris.  A fixed
tstare.  The catatonic Stargher lies in a hospital bed, wrists
tcuffed to the frame.  An IV feeds him fluids and monitors
treport his vital signs.  As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO
tPOLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway.  Novak, Ramsey
tand Teddy Lee stand by as the killer is examined by DR.
tMILTON REID, a brilliant forensic M.D. currently shining an
topthalmoscope into Stargher's eyes.  He pulls away and checks
tthe ELECTROENCENPHELOGRAM already on a lightbox.

</b>ttMinimal activity in the dorsolateral

</b>ttWhat about the legalities of this...?

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttStargher is in custody.  The functional
ttequivalent of being under arrest. 
ttNormally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he
ttdidn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. 
ttBut because of his condition, he doesn't
tthave the capacity to waive those rights.

<b>ttttHENRY
</b>ttSo what you're asking us to do is

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttNo, not at all.

ttWe're dealing with exigent

ttThe Law favors the victim and gives us a

</b>ttPretty much anything we want.  There's a

</b>ttThere's always a chance they'll confess.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttReally?  I don't work with violent

ttBut they've never had a sympathetic ear. 
ttThey need someone to understand why.
ttt(focusing on Catherine)
ttStargher used to hide the bodies very
ttcarefully.  It was part of the ritual. 
ttSome weren't found for weeks and any
ttphysical evidence had been meticulously
ttwiped clean.  But these last three...

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttIf he came to trust me, yes, but it
tttakes months to build that kind of

tMiriam gives Stargher an alcohol bath, the clinical procedure
ttaking on the quality of ritual.  Her wash cloth moves under
tStargher's chin and over his face.  She's careful around the
teyes and finds herself unable to look at them for long.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttI'll be fine.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttShe said convincingly.

tCatherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary
tconnections.  Reluctantly, Miriam retreats to the monitoring
tstation.  She "locks down" the procedure room and joins
tHenry, Novak, and Ramsey at the console.

<b>ttttNOVAK

tThat's like asking her to explain the rules of cricket.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttPsychostimulants, serotonin,

ttduplicates and expands upon the effects
ttof a chemical called oxytocin, forcing a
ttbreak in the neuron connections that
tthold experience.  So new experience can
ttform.

tRamsey is utterly lost and just sort of nods, but Novak is
tfascinated.  Catherine presses the bump on her hand.  A RED
tINDICATOR LIGHT flashes on.

<b>ttttHENRY
</b>ttThere's a touch-sensitive microchip
ttimplanted in her hand.  If she becomes
ttfrightened, disoriented, or simply wants
ttto end the session, she signals us to

tCatherine presses again and the red light shuts off.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttAlthough none of what she experiences is
ttreal, she can be tricked into thinking
ttit is.  The mind is awfully gullible, so
ttshe needs to monitor herself.

tCatherine and Stargher are suspended from the ceiling.  Henry
ttypes and the lights dim to a more somber, tranquil level. 
tVarious screens flicker to life, displaying the vital signs
tof both "feed" and receive."  Miriam initiates the injection
tprogram.

<b>ttttMIRIAM (CONT'D)
</b>ttCatherine?  I'm about to start.  If you
ttwant me to wait, or...

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttNo.  No.

tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, we see chemicals mix with her blood,
tthen feed the IV.  AT THE CONSOLE, as Henry types furiously
tat the computer keyboard, Novak asks Miriam:

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttYou said she has a "gift."

tOverhearing, Henry interrupts, pointing at a section of
tCatherine's "mind map."

<b>ttttHENRY
</b>ttNot a gift.  A highly evolved area in
tther cerebral cortex, that's all.  A
ttgenetic fluke.

<b>ttttMIRIAM
</b>ttCatherine has a tremendous capacity for
ttempathy.
ttt(clarifies)
ttWhen we started, there were a number of
tttest subjects - other therapists - who
ttacted as "receivers."  All they did was
ttobserve and report.  Nothing more.  But
ttCatherine, she had the ability to feel
ttwhat was happening.  She understood. 
ttAnd the patient responded.  Edward
ttengaged her in dialogue, took her
ttplaces, showed her things.  He knew she
ttcared.

tA hopeful, solemn Novak gazes through the window, watching
tCatherine's body as it becomes parallel to Stargher's...

tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine takes a deep breath and as
tthe drugs take effect, feels herself losing consciousness. 
tShe glances at Stargher, a man who tortures and kills women,
tthen looks up as the CLOTH MASK descends from the ceiling.

<b>ttttMIRIAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>ttIntravenous administration complete.

<b>ttttHENRY (O.S.)
</b>ttInitiating connection.

tWe follow fibrous wires running from Catherine's mask to
tStargher's.  Their blood mixing with chemicals in the IV-like
tcontainers.  The computer system humming.

<b>ttttHENRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>ttTransfer begins 1100 hours, 34 minutes,
tt12 seconds.

tCatherine's eye focuses on the mask.  As it comes closer, we
tsee the lining is laced with thread-like wires and microchips
tforming hyper-miniature circuit boards.  Catherine's eye
tblinks.  The mask covers her face.  Catherine's eye shuts.

tVision fades.  Darkness.  A faint light.  Microscopic veins
tin the eyelid become wires connected to chips.  And we're
tMOVING, into the circuitry.

<b>tENTRANCE ONE
</b>
<b>tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD
</b>
tThe pattern of the electronics grows into something more
torganic, textured, concrete.  Evolving into a world.  Black
tand shadow-filled, it resembles a labyrinthine complex of
tvertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its
tcore.

tOur journey into this bleak, grim place continues and we
toccasionally glimpse brief images of a boy's baptism.

tINTERCUT with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness
tand fragmented visions of CATHERINE connected to the
tapparatus, face masked, DESCENDING into this world.

tThere is an abrupt SHIFT from still images to regular motion
tand we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with
ttiny fish and tadpoles.  At water's edge, lying on rough,
tpebble-strewn ground, is a HAND.

tCatherine's hand.  We sense MOVEMENT, but she remains still. 
tFrom the darkness comes a DOG.  Black in color and
tfeatureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders
tinto a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view.  After a
tmoment of odd quiet, a DROP OF BLOOD hits the mask and we
tfollow Catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes
tit from her own face.

tIN MACROSCOPIC SUPER SLOW-MOTIONS, another BLOOD DROPLET
tsails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a RED
tANT, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just
ta TWIG.  As the insect scurries away, MORE DROPS pound the
tearth, splatter against "twig trees," and explode into pools
tof stagnant water...

tAs we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the
tworld into which Catherine descended.

tShe sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to
ther surroundings.  The "floor" is covered with filth, ash,
tpebbles, and insects.  Water is present in many forms,
tpuddles, moisture, dripping ceilings.

tEyes focusing, queasy, not fully "awake," Catherine notices
tthe crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets
tshowering the air.  She turns and finds the source.

tTHE BLACK DOG stands in the opposite room next to a tub full
tof BLOOD, shaking himself dry after his "bath."  Satisfied,
tthe animal stops and trots away.  Still adjusting to this
tnightmarish realm, Catherine at first doesn't hear it, but
tthen realizes that somewhere, a child is CRYING.  She looks
taround, then through a crack in the "floor," briefly catches
tsight of a BOY beneath her, on a level lower than hers.  As
the disappears into corridor ending in "nothing," we PULL BACK
tto show a MASSIVE LANDSCAPE of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace,
twalls, stairs, and ladders.  Leading everywhere and nowhere.

tCatherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific "room." 
tShortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she
tmoves to it.  We feel as though we're looking at a series of
tinterlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been
ttorn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or
tdoors.  Following a path of fragile steps, Catherine makes
ther way to the LIGHTED ROOM and enters.

<b>tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIGHTED ROOM

tA mottled HORSE stands with its head down, nose kissing the
tfloor, allowing the BOY to caress its neck.  This sweet
tanimal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and
tCatherine approaches with respect.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttHello?

tThe frightened child retreats into a corner of the
tclaustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. 
tSurprisingly - to the boy - the horse takes an affectionate
tstep toward Catherine, inviting her to take over.  Catherine
tallows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along
tthe mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttYeah, you like that, don't you?

tShe can see the boy hiding in the corner, stealing glances at
ther from the shadows.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttIs your name Carl?

tThe boy - YOUNG STARGHER - is startled and intrigued by the
tquestion - How did she know that?! - but says nothing.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttAnother little boy I know, he has a
tthorse, too.

tThe boy reacts to an unusual SOUND coming from the CEILING.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttHis name's Edward.  The boy, not the
tthorse...

tThe boy takes a few steps toward her, out of the shadows, but
the seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than
t"connecting" with Catherine.  Very anxiously, he looks at the
twall behind Catherine and watches an old wind-up kitchen
tTIMER click down.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhat's the matter, Carl?

tAgain, a sharp SOUND from the ceiling.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhat's wro---?

tYoung Stargher RUNS at her and SHOVES her hard!  Catherine
tFALLS BACK just as EIGHT SHEETS OF GLASS drop from the
tceiling!  Like oversize razor blades, they slice the horse
tinto four clean sections.  They separate and compact the
tquadrants until four glass-contained sections of dissected
thorse stand within the room.  Catherine SCREAMS, but the mare
tbarely acknowledged what happened.  Betraying no emotion, the
tboy runs.  The shaken Catherine takes a moment to collect

</b>
tYoung Stargher knows his way around the landscape, but
tCatherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight.  She
truns, climbs and crawls.  Until she's utterly lost and
tdisoriented.  Tired and having difficulty breathing, she
tdrops to her knees and "cools down."  She hears a NOISE
tnearby, gets to her feet, and finds a GEARED MECHANISM
tconnected to some kind of SHUTTERED DOOR composed of an
talmost metallic-looking glass.  Curious yet cautious, she
texamines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs
tof "traps" akin to the glass blades.  Finding none, she pulls
tthe mechanism and quickly steps back.

tThe shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive
tin the tiny cubicle beyond.  She retreats into shadow,
thiding.  Released from the chamber is a WOMAN.  As she moves
tout of a darkness, we see VICTIM ONE.

tGhostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to
t"sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the
tshadows, and ATTACKS!

tCatherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, BUT
<b>tTHE VICTIM IS ALREADY THERE! 
</b>tShe brutally grabs Catherine, THROWS her against the wall and
tSMACKS her head against it.  Catherine drops to the floor
tlike a rag doll.

tVictim One hefts Catherine onto her shoulder and with great
tpurpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the
tcore.  Passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness
tand light, a dazed Catherine is taken on a "tour" of
tStargher's world.  Passing mausoleum-like chambers filled
twith IMAGES of unspeakable horror and/or disturbing
tintensity.  At one of the rooms, we think we see Young
tStargher silently observing...

tSitting of standing in individual cubicles are STARGHER'S
tOTHER VICTIMS (TWO thru SIX), each woman resembling the
tgrotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in
tStargher's basement.  Dressed by a fetishistic sadist (Nine
tInch Nails meets the Brides of Dracula), they resemble bored
thousewives, barely acknowledging the new member of the
t"harem."

</b>
tVICTIM ONE drops Catherine in the center of the room and, job
tdone, crawls away.

tGroggy, feeling sick, Catherine sits up.  Unbeknownst to her,
tshe is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the
tkind of THRONE.  And someone is there.  In the dim pool of
tlight above the pedestal, we see a MAN rise from the throne. 
tThe wall behind him is covered in BLOOD RED CLOTH, and as he
tdescends, we realize it is a CAPE connected to EIGHT METAL
tRINGS pierced through the flesh of his back.  In a fluid
tmotion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as
tthe man reaches the floor.  Catherine knows he is there. 
tUnable to stop herself, she turns.  And sees the terrifying
tface of STARGHER.  But no the same Stargher.

tThis is STARGHER KING.

ttWhere you come from priddy thing?

tIn a split second, Catherine presses the implant on her hand.

tApparently capable of staying awake if properly caffeinated,
tNovak sits cross-legged on the floor, shoes off, analyzing
tRECENT PHOTOS AND DOCUMENTS sent to him via courier. 
tIgnoring a snoring Ramsey napping on a nearby cot, Novak
tlooks at blow-ups from the videos, blueprints of Stargher's
thouse, detailed shots of the basement, and a draftsman's
tconceptual drawing of the cell itself.

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttWhat happened?

tare on Catherine, who's just coming back to consciousness.

<b>ttttHENRY (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(re: orange section)
ttHowever, if her level of involvement is
ttrather intense, as it was just now, she

tCatherine sits next to the boy's bed, holding Edward's hand,

tShe appreciates his understanding.  And finds herself

</b>ttPeter, okay?

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttDo you feel there's a side of yourself

tCatherine laughs.  It helps her relax.  If only slightly.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttDuring the sessions.  When I'm inside. 
ttI see those things.  What a person

<b>tINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - CONFERENCE ROOM/COURTYARD - DAY

tCatherine and Novak sit on a bench in the center of the

</b>ttWhy'd you bring him here?

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttYou're the shrink, you tell me.

</b>ttIt's an old lawyer trick.  Target the

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttI did, yeah.

</b>ttThis is going to sound terrible, but...

tRamsey nods and heads back to the lab.

</b>ttThank you.

tBriefly, he touches her hand.  Catherine looks away from John
tto Novak's hand, to the photographs on the wall.  Stargher's

tAs the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring

tSlowly, confidently, she approaches the Shepherd, kneels, and
tremoves his leash and muzzle.  She strokes him and the dog
tinstantly warms up to her.

tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Stargher lies face down on a gurney. 
tNow taped to the wall near Stargher are PICTURES from the

tmask and gloves) carefully re-inserts the METAL RINGS (taken
tfrom an FBI EVIDENCE BAG) into the eight straps of flesh on
this back.  When he sees this, Valentine whimpers and hides. 
tCatherine comforts him.  Miriam finishes her task and removes

tCatherine as if asking for help.  She encourages the animal
tto lick and sniff Stargher's face and hands.

</b>ttIncreased neural activity in the frontal

tShe turns around to see the LABORATORY IS EMPTY and DEAD

tBOX, staying calm, she searches for and finds a TRAP DOOR on
tthe floor.  She pushes out.  The camera executes a complete

tCatherine plummets.  She tries to reach out, to stop her

tCatherine falls through a dark CAVERNOUS ROOM resembling a

tinto this one.

tOnce she passes through the hole, INSIDE THE DOME,

tto us, smoking a cigarette.  A white German Shepherd PUPPY
tclicks across the tile floor and YIPS at Catherine.  She
tagain hears the WEIRD NOISE.  A STAINLESS STEEL BOWL wobbles
tas Stargher's bloody rubber-gloved hands fill it with
tsomething.  Stargher knows she's there and isn't surprised by
ther presence, but he's not sure what to make of her.  What to
tdo with her.  He rises and walks past her to the sink.  He
tpulls off the gloves and washes his hands, glancing at her in
tthe mirror.

tCatherine cannot resist looking in the tub.  She sees a dead
tgirl, her torso sliced open.  Disgusted and mortified, she
tpulls back.

<b>ttttSTARGHER (O.S.)

tShe turns, and Stargher is no longer at the sink.

</b>ttBe careful...

tThe bumps into the stainless steel bowl and it topples to the
tfloor, spilling its contents of human organs.  Wobble-wobble
twobble.  The bowl makes its now-familiar noise.

<b>ttttSTARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhat did you do now?  You make a mess?

tAnd she can see him coming out of the shadows.  Catherine
tbacks into a corner, fearing what will come.

<b>ttttSTARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttI hate a mess.

tStargher steps into a pool of light, shooshes the puppy into
tthe hall, shuts the bathroom door, and looks right at
tCatherine.

<b>ttttSTARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhy are you here?

tGod almighty, what does she say?  What does she tell him?!

<b>ttttSTARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttDon't lie, now...

tSCRITCH-SCRITCH-SCRITCH.  The puppy scratches at the door and
twhimpers, but Stargher's not about to let him back in. 
tMoving slowly, carefully, he approaches Catherine.

<b>ttttSTARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttLiars will be punished.  

tCatherine makes a break for the door.  "Playfully," Stargher
tmakes a half-hearted attempt to block her, but she evades him
tand reaches for the knob.  But the door's not there.  SCRITCH
tSCRITCH-SCRITCH.  She can still hear the dog, but there's no
tdamn door.  She turns:

tNo door.  No window.  The girl's body and bloody remains have
tvanished.  An OVERHEAD LIGHT flickers on, giving the room the
tlook and feel of the cell.

<b>ttttSTARGHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhere do you think you're going?

tCatherine turns, back to the wall, calm and intimidating,
tStargher stands in the center regarding her with great
tcuriosity.  Catherine's ready to press the sensor.

<b>ttttSTARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttDon't do that.

tShe hesitates.

<b>ttttSTARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttIf you go away, you'll never find her.

tHow did he know?

<b>ttttSTARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttIf you never find her, she dies.  Like

tCatherine stops and listens.  She can't leave now.  The path
tto Julia has appeared.

<b>ttttSTARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttI mean, that's why you're here, right? 
ttWhy you came to my happy little home?

tHe reaches for her and she flinches.  Expecting such
tbehavior, Stargher grins.

<b>ttttSTARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou're pretty.  A pretty, pretty thing.

tCatherine cannot show her fear, not now.  She composes
therself and approaches him.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttI want to help you, Carl.

<b>ttttMIRIAM (O.S.)
</b>ttNo matter what happens, Peter, remember

tNovak's eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the IV-like
tcylinder.  A liquid cloud of his blood grows within. 
tPreparing the mixture for injection.

tThe viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the CAMERA
tMOVES INTO THE MIXTURE.  As blood and chemical swirls take
tshape, we MOVE FAST.  Deeper into the fluid at a molecular
tlevel.  We feel like we're SOARING over some kind of liquid
tlandscape.

tNOVAK HYPERVENTILATES.  He's having difficulty making the 98
ttransition.

tFlying faster, faster, faster.  Through an entire universe.

tNovak is in the procedure room.  Alone.  His face contorted
tas if feeling the effects of tremendous G-FORCE.

<b>tENTRANCE THREE
</b>
<b>tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD

tCLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with
thills.  THREE IDENTICAL WOMEN sit on black earth, their
tbodies positioned in a uniform pattern.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL
tNOVAK at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down
tin the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head. 
tWith difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, Novak
tbreathes deeply and rises to his knees.  His hand moves to
this face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the
tgravel, the sharpness of it against his face.  Removing the
tshroud-like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes
tit.

<b>ttttMOTHER ONE (O.S.)
</b>ttHave you seen him?

tNovak finds the first of the three - VISIONS OF STARGHER'S
tMOTHER - addressing him.  She, like the other two, speaks in
ta ghostly monotone, nearly devoid of emotion.

<b>ttttMOTHER ONE (CONT'D)
</b>ttMy boy, my little one.  His father took
tthim from me.  Have you seen him?

tAs she continues, almost mantra-like, WOMAN TWO BEGINS:

<b>ttttMOTHER TWO
</b>ttt(similar monotone)
ttMy child is an abomination.  He is
ttdamned.  He has no soul.

tThe women's repetitive "monologues" overlap.  Aurual layers
tnow added by THREE.

<b>ttttMOTHER THREE
</b>ttMe god me boy.  Me god good son.

tNovak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings.  The sights,
tsounds and feel of the place.  Like being within a dream.  As
the backs away from the odd quartet, SHIMMERING LIGHT dances
tacross his face.  Shading his eyes.  Novak searches for the
tsource.

tOpposite him, across the valley, is a SHEER ROCK WALL.  A
tmassive cliff face pockmarked with rough "windows."  Like a
tstar, the LIGHT sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of
tMIRROR reflecting a beam away from Novak's face to a PATH
tcutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall.

tThe light guiding him, Novak follows the path and starts to
tCLIMB, finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly
tinfinite passages.  Like tombs, or the "drawers" of a
tmausoleum.  Deep within one of them, THE LIGHT FLICKERS. 
tFades.  And Novak crawls into darkness.

<b>tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN

tNovak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence. 
tThe place reeks of sex, pain, lust, and cruelty.  As he moves
tdeeper into the chamber, Novak sees YOUNG STARGHER perched
tatop some kind of pedestal, crouching, fingering his mirror
tLOCKET, bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners of
tthe room

tThe FLICKERING LIGHT pinpoints a FIGURE emerging from the
tdarkness.  It is Catherine.  Altered to an image of
tStargher's victims.  Her skin, face, clothing, eyes, are just
tlike the Victims'.  It's a shocking, strange image, made even
tmore disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face.  Novak
tis staggered by the sight.  His vision and hearing become
taffected by blurred vision, sharp sounds - then focus to
tclarity as he reminds himself...

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttNot real...

tLike an ethereal queen of the damned, she strides toward him,
tnarrowing her eyes.

<b>ttttNOVAK (CONT'D)

tShe exhibits no recognition of her name.  Catherine
tseductively moves closer to Novak, their bodies almost
ttouching, her hands caressing his hair, lips, neck...

<b>ttttNOVAK (CONT'D)
</b>ttJesus.  Catherine.  Listen to me...

tShe presses her finger to his lips and forces him down, onto
tthe floor, his back to the pedestal.  Catherine straddles
tNovak, and when he tries to stand, she holds him down,
tforcing him to stay.

<b>ttttNOVAK (CONT'D)
</b><b>ttLISTEN TO ME!
</b>
tShe steals a glance over his shoulder and glimpses a MALE
tFIGURE coming toward them, coming into the light.  Novak is
tutterly unaware of what's happening.  Catherine is keeping
thim occupied.  Waiting for the arrival of...

<b>tSTARGHER KING

tCatherine LAUGHS.  Novak catches only a fleeting glimpse of
tthe monster before Stargher King GRABS him by the throat and
tSMASHES his head against a pedestal.

tinstantly realizes what's happened.

tHe lies on the pedestal, face up, spread-eagle, his wrists
tand ankles bound to the cold stone surface with leathery
tcords.  Standing over him, in a pool of light, is Stargher
tKing.  Wearing what could be seen as CEREMONIAL GARB, a
tsilent, solemn Stargher King prepares himself for execution
tof a ritual by polishing and arranging an assortment of
tshiny, sharp, macabre TOOLS.

tNovak shuts his eyes and silently tells himself, Not real. 
tHe opens them, breathes deeply and focuses on Catherine.

tknife, a misshapen hammer, a long slender needle...

<b>ttttNOVAK (CONT'D)

</b>ttWhen you were twenty-one, you were

ttMe god gut you like a dear.

tStargher King emits animalistic growls, Catherine turns and
tsees an intact Novak standing next to her.  As if nothing had
thappened.

tCatherine and Novak RUN out of the den, into the tunnel from
twhich Novak gained access.  He stops, ready to press the

</b>ttWait...

tShe uses strength and balance to reach a position just below

tA bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of

tThe pond ripples.  Visible through the crystal-clear water is
tYOUNG STARGHER, rising to the surface like a drowning victim
tsuddenly breaking through to air.  Panicked, he scrambles to
tshore and pulls himself to land.  Although the place is
tcomforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it
tfrightens him.  Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this
tway and that.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (O.S.)

tThe boy turns toward the voice and finds CATHERINE, her hair
twaving in the wind, skin glowing, eyes bright, cutting a
tmagnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior
tgoddess. 
tShe opens her arms and the boy runs to her, basking in the
tcomfort of her embrace.  He shivers and she holds him
ttightly.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt's okay, honey, you're with me now.

tShe is touched that he would ask and strokes his face.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttt(regretfully)
ttOh...no, honey, I'm sorry.  It's doesn't

tHe slowly turns to her.

</b>ttI'll make sure it happens, Carl.  I'll

tYoung Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.  Over his
tshoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool. 
tCENTIPEDES CRAWL over her legs and hair.  She stands and
tbrushes them off.  The atmosphere grows darker and ominous.

<b>ttttYOUNG STARGHER
</b>ttHe found me...

tCatherine bristles as STARGHER KING RISES FROM THE POOL like
ta human serpent.  The brilliant colors of Catherine's world
tfade to GRIM TONES.

</b>ttNo?!??!?!?!?

tStargher King laughs.

</b>ttHoo you thing you are?? Himm Muther?

tHe comes close and reaches for the boy...

<b>ttttSTARGHER KING (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou gimme liddle worm.

tFor a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated. 
tPerhaps near an emotional breakdown.  But that is not the
tcase.  She quietly lowers little Carl to the ground and
twhispers something in his ear.  As the boy nods, runs and
thides, a ferocity grows within her.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttI said no.

tLike a vengeful Valkyrie, she emits what can only be called a
tBATTLE CRY!  STARGHER ATTACKS!  Arms reaching for her. 
tCatherine BLOCKS, PUNCHES, AND KICKS.  Stargher King doubles
tover.  Catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her
tbent KNEE, breaking his nose.

</b>ttWelcome to my world.

tAs blood flows from his nostrils, Stargher King grins...

<b>ttttSTARGHER KING
</b>ttYou funny.  You thing you stop me god?

tHE CHARGES.  At the right moment, Catherine sidesteps and
tSMASHES him in the ribs as he passes.  Stargher King crumples
tto the ground and she KICKS an uppercut to this chin.  Rising
tfrom the mud and muck, Stargher King lands a POWERFUL BLOW to
ther head, sending her flying.  He lifts the stunned Catherine
twith one hand and pulls her face to his...

tCatherine looks into his soulless eyes.  Then SPITS in them
tand BITES his face!  She breaks free as he YOWLS with pain. 
tHe steps toward her, but his feet don't move.  The earth
titself appears to wrap around them and turn hard, like
tconcrete.  Stargher King HOWLS with frustration.

</b>ttDon't hurt him!

tShe spins around and sees not Stargher King, but MARTIN.

<b>ttttYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttHe didn't mean it.  I was bad.

tDisturbed by the transformation, Catherine backs away.  Her
tvision blurs, the sound distorts.  And the earth cracks
taround Stargher King's ankles.

<b>ttttYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttHe teached me a lesson.  I deserved it.

tFighting feelings of disorientation, she kneels before the

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttNo one deserves it, Carl.  No one.

tShe reaches out to him, but the child is JERKED into the air
tby Stargher King.  In one hand, the monster holds little
tCarl.  In the other - a KNIFE.  His face and chest red with
tcrimson, Stargher King fixes his eyes on Catherine with a
tpredator's stare.

<b>ttttSTARGHER KING
</b>ttYer world.  My knife.

tStargher King raises the blade toward the boy's throat and -
tSNAP!  The strong arms of an adult Stargher breaks his arm at
tthe elbow.  Both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground
tas Stargher King YOWLS like a stuck pig, the good arm
tcradling the other.

<b>ttttSTARGHER KING (CONT'D)
</b>ttMe god hurt!  Why you do that?  Why?!

ttYou want a mommy?  Is that what you

tIn an almost dream-like motion, the child hands the blade to

<b>ttttSTARGHER
</b>ttEnough.

tAnd he DRIVES the thing into Stargher King's heart.  For a
tbrief moment, Martin's face is superimposed over Stargher
tKing's.  Stunned, he slumps and regards adult Stargher with
tsad, troubled eyes.

<b>ttttMARTIN
</b>ttt(as Stargher King)
ttWhy?  What'd I do?...

tStargher TWISTS the handle of the blade and Martin/Stargher

tCatherine.

</b>ttCarl...?

tThe boy runs to adult Stargher who lifts the child into his
tarms and holds him close.

</b>ttBye.

tShe looks to adult Stargher and begins to understand.  He
tdescends into the pool, the boy resting his head on his
tshoulder.

<b>ttttSTARGHER KING
</b>ttThank you, Catherine.  You did help me. 
ttMore than you'll ever know.

tMan and boy disappear beneath the water's surface.  Catherine
tstands and sees that Stargher King's body has vanished. 
tShe walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, Stargher
tand little Carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell.

tHe opens the door and escorts a leashed VALENTINE into the
tliving room.  Catherine's cat squirms from her arms and hides
tunder the couch.

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttThat went well.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttGive her a minute.
ttt(smiles at the dog)
ttHello, Valentine.

tNovak unleashes the albino Shepherd and he runs to Catherine,
tlicking her face, wagging his tail.

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttYou sure about this?

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttAbsolutely.
ttt(calling for the cat)
ttAbigail...

tValentine picks up the cat's scent and sniffs around the base
tof the sofa.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttI heard Julia and John got married.

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttYep.  Eloped.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttGood for them.

tValentine settles on the floor.  Slowly, Abigail's curiosity
tgets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's
tnose.  Patient and sweet, Valentine lies still, allowing the
tcat to reach an acceptable level of comfort.

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttWell look at that.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttI told you.  You have to be optimistic. 
ttBelieve in them...

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttSo you say.

tAmazingly, Abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttHe's mine?

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttAll yours.  My boss says it's one of the
ttstrangest requests the Bureau's ever
tthad.

tCatherine laughs.  She likes that.

<b>ttttNOVAK (CONT'D)
</b>ttHe also says that until proven
ttdifferently, Julia Hickson was found as
tta result of good old-fashioned detective
ttwork.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttIt doesn't matter...

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttI don't know.  I think it does.
ttt(genuine concern)
ttYou know, Catherine... If you ever want
ttto talk about it.  What happened to
ttStargher.  That last time.

tIt's painfully clear the thought of it still troubles her.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttNot just yet.  Okay?

tNovak doesn't push it.  He just takes her hand and gives it a
tgentle squeeze.  The cat dashes into the kitchen and
tValentine follows.

<b>ttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>ttThey're hungry.

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttI got it.

tHe moves into the kitchen.  In a moment of quiet
tintrospection, Catherine looks at the television screen, at
tDorothy accidentally hitting the wicked Witch with a bucket
tof water, causing her to melt.  And she looks away, unable to
twatch, disturbed by the image.  She turns to the kitchen and
tsees Novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat.  He rises and
treturns to the living room.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttThank you.

<b>ttttNOVAK
</b>ttNo problem.

<b>ttttCATHERINE
</b>ttNo.  Thank you.

tHe smiles and nods, gently resting his hand on her shoulder. 
tCatherine shuts her eyes and leans toward him, comforted by
tsimple human touch...

<b>ttttttt FADE TO BLACK.
