<b>tINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tThe PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black
tbackground.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the
tsimple words in white lettering:

<b>tttt  THE GODFATHER
</b>
tWhile this remains, we hear: "I believe in America."
tSuddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
tman of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
temotion.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttAmerica has made my fortune.

tAs he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttI raised my daughter in the American
ttfashion; I gave her freedom, but
tttaught her never to dishonor her
ttfamily.  She found a boy friend,
ttnot an Italian.  She went to the
ttmovies with him, stayed out late.
ttTwo months ago he took her for a
ttdrive, with another boy friend.
ttThey made her drink whiskey and
ttthen they tried to take advantage
ttof her.  She resisted; she kept her
tthonor.  So they beat her like an
ttanimal.  When I went to the hospital
tther nose was broken, her jaw was
ttshattered and held together by
ttwire, and she could not even weep
ttbecause of the pain.

tHe can barely speak; he is weeping now.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttI went to the Police like a good
ttAmerican.  These two boys were
ttarrested and brought to trial.  The
ttjudge sentenced them to three years
ttin prison, and suspended the
ttsentence.  Suspended sentence!
ttThey went free that very day.  I
ttstood in the courtroom like a fool,
ttand those bastards, they smiled at
ttme.  Then I said to my wife, for
ttJustice, we must go to The Godfather.

tBy now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office
tin his home.

tThe blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with
tpatterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the
tshoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small
ttable, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands
timpatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a
tglass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and
tvoices of many people outside.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttBonasera, we know each other for
ttyears, but this is the first time
ttyou come to me for help.  I don't
ttremember the last time you invited
ttme to your house for coffee...even
ttthough our wives are friends.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttWhat do you want of me?  I'll give
ttyou anything you want, but do what
ttI ask!

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttAnd what is that Bonasera?

tBONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttNo.  You ask for too much.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttI ask for Justice.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttThe Court gave you justice.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttAn eye for an eye!

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttBut your daughter is still alive.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttThen make them suffer as she
ttsuffers.  How much shall I pay you.

tBoth HAGEN and SONNY react.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttYou never think to protect yourself
ttwith real friends.  You think it's
ttenough to be an American.  All
ttright, the Police protects you,
ttthere are Courts of Law, so you
ttdon't need a friend like me.
ttBut now you come to me and say Don
ttCorleone, you must give me justice.
ttAnd you don't ask in respect or
ttfriendship.  And you don't think to
ttcall me Godfather; instead you come
ttto my house on the day my daughter
ttis to be married and you ask me to
ttdo murder...for money.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttAmerica has been good to me...

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttThen take the justice from the
ttjudge, the bitter with the sweet,
ttBonasera.  But if you come to me
ttwith your friendship, your loyalty,
ttthen your enemies become my enemies,
ttand then, believe me, they would
ttfear you...

tSlowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttBe my friend.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttGood.  From me you'll get Justice.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttGodfather.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttSome day, and that day may never
ttcome, I would like to call upon you
ttto do me a service in return.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tA HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There
tare at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard
tand gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and
tcountless tables covered with food and wine.

tDON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a
tson: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of
tthe wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the
thands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the
tchildren, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry
twith them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked
tbread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

tThe entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,
tMAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN
tand his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the
tbride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into
tthe pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWhere's Michael?

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttHe'll be here Pop, it's still early.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttThen the picture will wait for him.

tEveryone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves
tback to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the
tdirection of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns
tit.  Then he moves to his wife.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttSandra, watch the kids.  They're
ttrunning wild.

<b>ttttSANDRA
</b>ttYou watch yourself.

tHAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine
tbarrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM
tcrooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is
tnext, straightens, and follows HAGEN.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tOutside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,
tworking together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out
tof the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers
tdown in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter
tcoming from the party in the distance.

tA MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.

tBARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the
twatchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to
tembrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.

tThe MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
tnumber in the notebook.  A shiney new Cadillac with wooden
tbumpers.

tPETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping
tbellies with the ladies.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttPaulie...wine...WINE.

tHe mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.
tPAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings
tit to him.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttYou look terrif on the floor!

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttWhat are you, a dance judge?  Go do
ttyour job; take a walk around the
ttneighborhood... see everything is
ttokay.

tPAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps
tback into the dance.

tThe MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
tnumber in the notebook.

tTESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-
tOLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his
tenormous brown shoes.

tThe MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out
tof the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by
tCLEMENZA and PAULIE.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttBuddy, this is a private party.

tThe MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the
tsedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.
tThe DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,
twithout saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the
tground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,
tand another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the
twalk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttGoddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tDON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the
tdark study.

<b>ttttNAZORINE
</b>tt...a fine boy from Sicily, captured
ttby the American Army, and sent to
ttNew Jersey as a prisoner of war...

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttNazorine, my friend, tell me what I
ttcan do.

<b>ttttNAZORINE
</b>ttNow that the war is over, Enzo,
ttthis boy is being repatriated to
ttItaly.  And you see, Godfather...
ttt  (he wrings his hands,
ttt  unable to express himself)
ttHe...my daughter...they...

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttYou want him to stay in this country.

<b>ttttNAZORINE
</b>ttGodfather, you understand everything.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttTom, what we need is an Act of
ttCongress to allow Enzo to become a
ttcitizen.

<b>ttttNAZORINE
</b>ttt  (impressed)
ttAn Act of Congress!

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt  (nodding)
ttIt will cost.

tThe DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE
tnods.

<b>ttttNAZORINE
</b>ttIs that all?  Godfather, thank
ttyou...
ttt  (backing out, enthusiastically)
ttOh, wait till you see the cake I
ttmade for your beautiful daughter!

tNAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.
tDON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWho do I give this job to?

tThe DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttNot to one of our paisans...give it
ttto a Jew Congressman in another
ttdistrict.  Who else is on the list
ttfor today?

tThe DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting
tto see him.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttFrancesco Nippi.  His nephew has
ttbeen refused parole.  A bad case.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
<b>tWHAT HE SEES:
</b>
tNIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.

<b>ttttHAGEN (O.S.)
</b>ttHis father worked with you in the
ttfreight yards when you were young.

tLUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.

<b>ttttHAGEN (O.S.)
</b>ttHe's not on the list, but Luca
ttBrasi wants to see you.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tThe DON turns to HAGEN.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttIs it necessary?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttYou understand him better than
ttanyone.

tThe DON nods to this.  Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
<b>tWHAT HE SEES:
</b>
tMICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,
tleads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally
tstopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tThe DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,
tfollowing them.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tMICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces
ther to his GIRL.

<b>tEXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tThe DON's eyes peering through the blinds.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tKAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,
tburdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She
tis exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and
tthe vitality.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI've never seen anything like it.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI told you I had a lot of relatives.

tKAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.
tWe see what she sees:

tHer interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine
tbarrels.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt  (amused)
ttMichael, what are those men doing?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThey're waiting to see my father.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThey're talking to themselves.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThey're going to talk to my father,
ttwhich means they're going to ask
tthim for something, which means they
ttbetter get it right.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhy do they bother him on a day
ttlike this?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttBecause they know that no Sicilian
ttwill refuse a request on his
ttdaughter's wedding day.

<b>tEXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tCONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her
toverly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He
tis bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.
tShe absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from
thim long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white
tenvelopes they are putting into the large white purse she
tholds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one
tof her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,
twhere she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.
tCARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the
tbulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the
tthings hold.

tDiscreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttt  (whispered)
ttCut it out, Connie.

tThe purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,
tis fat with money.

<b>ttttPAULIE (O.S.)
</b>ttWhat do you think?  Twenty grand?

tA little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a
tprosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking
teyes from the purse.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttWho knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty,
ttthirty grand in small bills cash in
ttthat silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if
ttthis was somebody else's wedding!

tSONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY
tMANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he
tglances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with
tsome WOMEN.

tHe bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.

tSANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttIs it true what they say about your
tthusband, Sandra?

tSANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and
tfurther apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.
tThrough her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.
tSONNY and LUCY are gone.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tThe empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY
tsurreptitiously steps out.

tShe looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,
tmotioning for her to come up.

tShe lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tKAY and MICHAEL.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt  (in a spooky low tone)
ttMichael, that scarey guy...Is he a
ttrelative?

tShe has picked out LUCA BRASI.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You
ttwouldn't like him.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt  (Excited)
ttWho is he?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (Sizing her up)
ttYou really want to know?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYes.  Tell me.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYou like spaghetti?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou know I love spaghetti.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThen eat your spaghetti and I'll
tttell you a Luca Brasi story.

tShe starts to eat her spaghetti.

tShe begins eating, looking at him eagerly.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttOnce upon a time, about fifteen
ttyears ago some people wanted to
tttake over my father's olive oil
ttbusiness.  They had Al Capone send
ttsome men in from Chicago to kill my
ttfather, and they almost did.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAl Capone!

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttMy Father sent Luca Brasi after
ttthem.  He tied the two Capone men
tthand and foot, and stuffed small
ttbath towels into their mouths.
ttThen he took an ax, and chopped one
ttman's feet off...

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMichael...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThen the legs at the knees...

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMichael you're trying to scare me...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThen the thighs where they joined
ttthe torso.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMichael, I don't want to hear
ttanymore...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThen Luca turned to the other man...

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMichael, I love you.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt...who out of sheer terror had
ttswallowed the bath towel in his
ttmouth and suffocated.

tThe smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a
ttall story.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI never know when you're telling me
ttthe truth.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI told you you wouldn't like him.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHe's coming over here!

tLUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near
ttheir table.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay
ttAdams.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt  (having survived LUCA)
ttHow do you do.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttMy brother, Tom Hagen.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttHello Kay.  Your father's inside,
ttdoing some business.
ttt  (privately)
ttHe's been asking for you.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThanks Tom.

tHAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously
tfollowing.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttIf he's your brother, why does he
tthave a different name?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttMy brother Sonny found him living
ttin the streets when he was a kid,
ttso my father took him in.  He's a
ttgood lawyer.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tDON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the
<b>tYOUNG COUPLE.
</b>
<b>ttttLUCA (O.S.)
</b>ttDon Corleone...

tTHE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves
tforward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his
tjacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes
ta formal speech.

<b>ttttLUCA
</b>ttt  (with difficulty)
ttDon Corleone...I am honored, and
ttgrateful...that you invited me to
ttyour home...on the wedding day of
ttyour...daughter.
ttMay their first child...be a
ttmasculine child.  I pledge my never
ttending loyalty.
ttt  (he offers the envelope)
ttFor your daughter's bridal purse.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttThank you, Luca, my most valued
ttfriend.

tTHE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so
ttightly we might imagine it to be painful.

<b>ttttLUCA
</b>ttLet me leave you, Don Corleone.  I
ttknow you are busy.

tHe turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with
tthe same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes
tmore easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttI'm sure it's the most generous
ttgift today.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThe Senator called--apologized for
ttnot coming personally, but said
ttyou'd understand.  Also, some of
ttthe Judges...they've all sent gifts.
ttAnd another call from Virgil
ttSollozzo.

tDON CORLEONE is not pleased.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThe action is narcotics.  Sollozzo
tthas contacts in Turkey for the
ttpoppy, in Sicily for the plants to
ttprocess down to morphine or up to
ttheroin.  Also he has access to this
ttcountry.  He's coming to us for
ttfinancial help, and some sort of
ttimmunity from the law.  For that we
ttget a piece of the action, I
ttcouldn't find out how much.
ttSollozzo is vouched for by the
ttTattaglia family, and they may have
tta piece of the action.  They call
ttSollozzo the Turk.
ttHe's spent a lot of time in Turkey
ttand is suppose to have a Turkish
ttwife and kids.  He's suppose to be
ttvery quick with the knife, or was,
ttwhen he was younger.  Only in
ttmatters of business and with some
ttreasonable complaint.  Also he has
ttan American wife and three children
ttand he is a good family man.

tTHE DON nods.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttHe's his own boss, and very
ttcompetent.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttAnd with prison record.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttTwo terms; one in Italy, one in the
ttUnited States.  He's known to the
ttGovernment as a top narcotics man.
ttThat could be a plus for us; he
ttcould never get immunity to testify.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWhen did he call?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThis morning.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttOn a day like this.  Consiglero, do
ttyou also have in your notes the the
ttTurk made his living from
ttProstitution before the war, like
ttthe Tattaglias do now.  Write that
ttdown before you forget it.  The
ttTurk will wait.

tWe now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers
tfrom outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWhat that?  It sounds like Johnny.

tHe moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the
troom with light.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttIt is Johnny.  He came all the way
ttfrom California to be at the wedding.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttShould I bring him in.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttNo.  Let the people enjoy him.  You
ttsee?  He is a good godson.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttIt's been two years.  He's probably
ttin trouble again.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tJOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and
texcitement of the wedding GUESTS.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI didn't know your family knew
ttJohnny Fontane.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttSure.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI used to come down to New York
ttwhenever he sang at the Capitol and
ttscream my head off.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHe's my father's godson; he owes
tthim his whole career.

tJOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.
tThey call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttMy Godson has come three thousand
ttmiles to do us honor and no one
ttthinks to wet his throat.

tAt once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who
ttakes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttI kept trying to call you after my
ttdivorce and Tom always said you
ttwere busy.  When I got the Wedding
ttinvitation I knew you weren't sore
ttat me anymore, Godfather.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttCan I do something for you still?
ttYou're not too rich, or too famous
ttthat I can't help you?

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttI'm not rich anymore, Godfather,
ttand...my career, I'm almost washed
ttup...

tHe's very disturbed.  The GODFATHER indicates that he come
twith him to the office so no one will notice.  He turns to
<b>tHAGEN.
</b>
<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttTell Santino to come in with us.
ttHe should hear some things.

tThey go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tHAGEN glances up the staircase.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttSonny?

tThen he goes up.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tSONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her
tgown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing
tagainst the door.  Her face peeks out from the layers of
tpetticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.

</b>
<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttACT LIKE A MAN!  By Christ in
ttHeaven, is it possible you turned
ttout no better than a Hollywood
ttfinocchio.

tBoth HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON
tsmiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still
tadjusting his clothes.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttAll right, Hollywood...Now tell me
ttabout this Hollywood Pezzonovanta
ttwho won't let you work.

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttHe owns the studio.  Just a month

tThe DON is silent, stern.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttYou take care of your family?

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttSure.

tHe glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as
the can.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttYou look terrible.  I want you to
tteat well, to rest.  And spend time
ttwith your family.  And then, at the

</b>ttI'll make him an offer he can't

tHe takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough
tto hurt.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttNow go back to the party and leave

tHe closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN.

</b>ttWhen does my daughter leave with

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThey'll cut the cake in a few

ttWhat else, Tom?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI've called the hospital; they've

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttGenco will wait for me.  Santino,

</b>ttUnderstood.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tNow all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over
tthe entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels
tin a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most
textravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument
tof his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they
tbegin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,
tin the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and
tkiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks
thitting five hundred glasses.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tSilence.

tHIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A
tsingle black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the
tdriver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who
tsits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWill your girl friend get back to
ttthe city all right?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTom said he'd take care of it.

tThe DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through
tthe gate of the great Corleone Mall.

<b>tINT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tA long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can
tsee a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but
tall plump and dressed in black.

tDON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.  But then the
tDON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder.  MICHAEL
tstops and turns toward his FATHER.  The two looks at one
tanother for some time.  SILENCE.  DON CORLEONE then lifts
this hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's
tuniform.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWhat was this for?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttFor bravery.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttAnd this?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttFor killing a man.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWhat miracles you do for strangers.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI fought for my country.  It was my
ttchoice.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttAnd now, what do you choose to do?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI'm going to finish school.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttGood.  When you are finished, come
ttand talk to me.  I have hopes for
ttyou.

tAgain they regard each other without a word.  MICHAEL turns,
tand continues on.  DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then
tfollows.

<b>tINT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tDON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR
tVIEW.  He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttt  (whispered)
ttGenco, I've brought my sons to pay
tttheir respects.  And look, even
ttJohnny Fontane, all the way from
ttHollywood.

tGENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.  DON CORLEONE
ttakes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around
this bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttGodfather, Godfather, it's your
ttdaughter's wedding day, you cannot
ttrefuse me.  Cure me, you have the
ttpower.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttI have no such power...but Genco,
ttdon't fear death.

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttt  (with a sly wink)
ttIt's been arranged, then?

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttYou blaspheme.  Resign yourself.

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttYou need your old Consigliere.  Who
ttwill replace me?
ttt  (suddenly)
ttStay with me Godfather.  Help me
ttmeet death.  If he sees you, he
ttwill be frightened and leave me in

ttfew strings, eh?  We'll outwit that
ttbastard as we outwitted all those
ttothers.
ttt  (clutching his hand)
ttGodfather, don't betray me.

tThe DON motions all the others to leave the room.  They do.
tHe returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and
twhispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

</b>
tThe interior of a non-stop Constellation.  HAGEN is one of
tthe very few passengers on this late flight.  He looks like
tany young lawyer on a business trip.  He is tired from the
tdifficult preparation and duties that he has just executed
tduring the wedding.  On the seat next to him is an enormous,
tbulging briefcase.  He closes his eyes.

<b>tINT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tThe honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE.  CARLO is in his
tundershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the
tenvelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the
tcontents.  CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble
tbathroom.  She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and
ttries to get his interest.

<b>tINT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tThe hallway of an apartment building.  SONNY enters, climbs
ttwo steps at a time.  He knocks, and then whispers.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttIt's me, Sonny.

tThe door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling
thim into the apartment.

<b>tINT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tLUCA BRASI's tiny room.  He is partly dressed.  He kneels
tand reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked
ttrunk.  He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof
tvest.  He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then
tputs on his shirt and jacket.  He takes his gun, quickly
tdisassembles, checks, and reassembles it.  And leaves.

tOne photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm

tlovely young child star to his immediate right.

tHAGEN considers other papers.

<b>tINT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tDON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.
tHe straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.

</b>ttRemember my new Consigliere, a
ttlawyer with his briefcase can steal
ttmore than a hundred men with guns.

<b>tEXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tJACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,
tarmed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate,
tand TOM enters.

<b>tEXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tHAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal
tgardens, martinis in hand.

<b>ttttWOLTZ
</b>ttYou should have told me your boss

tThey pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a
thuge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM."
tTWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they
trise as WOLTZ approaches.

<b>ttttWOLTZ
</b>ttYou like horses?  I like horses, I
ttlove 'em.  Beautiful, expensive
ttRacehorses.

tThe animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him
twith true love in his voice.

<b>ttttWOLTZ
</b>ttKhartoum...Kartoum...You are

<b>tINT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tHAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,
tattended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the
twalls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttMr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.
ttThat is very close, a very sacred
ttreligious relationship.

<b>ttttWOLTZ
</b>ttOkay, but just tell him this is one

tttry me again on anything else.

</b>ttHe never asks a second favor when
tthe has been refused the first.
ttUnderstood?

<b>ttttWOLTZ
</b>ttYou smooth son of a bitch, let me
ttlay it on the line for you, and

</b>ttOkay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny

ttlessons!  We spent hundreds of
ttthousands of dollars--I was going
ttto make her a star.  I'll be even
ttmore frank, just to show you that
ttI'm not a hard-hearted man, that it
ttwasn't all dollars and cents.  That
ttgirl was beautiful and young and
ttinnocent and she was the greatest
ttpiece of ass I've ever ad and I've
tthad them all over the world.  Then
ttJohnny comes along with that olive

<b>tEXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tAn unimposing little building in New York City on Mott
tStreet with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,
tINC." next to an open-faced fruit market.

tA dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we
tcannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters
tthe building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

<b>tINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tLooking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps
tbefore he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very
tdark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard,
tand obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of
tthe stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,
tintroducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of
thandshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful
tintroductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's
tglass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.
tThey are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are
tbrought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around
tin a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,
tCLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish
twith all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no
tone.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear
tthat this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttMy business is heroin, I have poppy
ttfields, laboratories in Narseilles
ttand Sicily, ready to go into
ttproduction.  My importing methods
ttare as safe as these things can be,
ttabout five per cent loss.  The risk
ttis nothing, the profits enormous.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWhy do you come to me?  Why do I
ttdeserve your generosity?

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttI need two million dollars in
ttcash...more important, I need a
ttfriend who has people in high
ttplaces; a friend who can guarantee
ttthat if one of my employees be
ttarrested, they would get only light
ttsentences.  Be my friend.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWhat percentages for my family?

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttThirty per cent.  In the first year
ttyour share would be four million
ttdollars; then it would go up.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttAnd what is the percentage of the
ttTattaglia family?

tSOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttMy compliments.  I'll take care of
ttthem from my share.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttSo.  I receive 30 per cent just for
ttfinance and legal protection.  No
ttworries about operations, is that
ttwhat you tell me?

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttIf you think two million dollars in
ttcash is just finance, I congratulate
ttyou Don Corleone.

tThere is a long silence; in which each person present feels
tthe tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttI said I would see you because I've
ttheard you're a serious man, to be
tttreated with respect...
ttt  (pause)
ttBut I'll say no to you.

tWe feel this around the room.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttI'll give you my reasons.  I have
ttmany, many friends in Politics.
ttBut they wouldn't be so friendly if
ttmy business was narcotics instead
ttof gambling.  They think gambling
ttis something like liquor, a harmless
ttvice...and they think narcotics is
ttdirty business.

tSOLLOZZO takes a breath.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttNo...how a man makes his living is
ttnone of my business.  But this
ttproposition of yours is too risky.
ttAll the people in my family lived
ttwell the last ten years, I won't
ttrisk that out of greed.

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttAre you worried about security for
ttyour million?

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttThe Tattaglias will guarantee your
ttinvestment also.

tThis startles SONNY; he blurts out.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttThe Tattaglia family guarantees our
ttinvestment?

tSOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face
thim.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out
tof line.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttYoung people are greedy, and they
tthave no manners.  They speak when
ttthey should listen.  But I have a
ttsentimental weakness for my
ttchildren, and I've spoiled them, as
ttyou see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my
ttno is final.

tSOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He
tglances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do
tas well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally
ttakes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard:

tThe DON turns to SONNY.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttSantino, never let anyone outside
ttthe family know what you are
ttthinking.  I think your brain is
ttgoing soft from all that comedy you
ttplay with that young girl.

tTWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display
twith the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWhat is this nonsense?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttIt's from Johnny.  It was announced
ttthis morning.  He's going to play
ttthe lead in the new Woltz Brothers
ttfilm.

<b>tINT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)
</b>
tIt is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,
tpresumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room
tfrom the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see
this face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably;
tmutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something
twet.

tHe wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.
tHe looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is
tfrightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on
this sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of
tblood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically,
tmoving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face
twith the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of
this bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy
ttendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle
tof blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and
tthe enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered
twith blood.

tWOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out.
tThen, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure
tterror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and
tknees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

tget in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open
tfruit stand near the corner.

tThe PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  The DON walks among
tthe trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular
tpiece of fruit.  As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the
tpieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.  The DON
tpays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then
tturns back to the car.

ttoward the parked car.

tThe paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins
trolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

tThe PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking
tover an entire case of fruit.

tThe TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.

tTheir feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are

tFREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;
thaving difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun
ttrembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops
tthe gun.

tThe gun falls amid the rolling fruit.

tThe GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed
tDON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;
tand pools of blood are beginning to form.

tThe GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;
tthey disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.

tThe PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:
trather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely
tfrom around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from
twindows.  But the street itself is now empty.

tFREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great
tpuddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and
tface down in them.

tFREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying
tsomething we cannot understand.  He begins to weep profusely.

tSOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,
trather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
tBRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter

tLUCA looks up at him.

tThen SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.
tLUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both
tclamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is
tthrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His
tface begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally
tpurple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a
tfar more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes
tbulge.

</b>
<b>tEXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tMorning in a simple Brooklyn suburb.  There are rows of
tpleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.  A
tdark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a
tnoticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.  This
tis ROCCO LAMPONE.  The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,
ttalks to him through the screen door, and then points to the
tside of the house.  ROCCO moves to the garage, which is
tspecially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work
twashing a shiny brand new Lincoln.  LAMPONE admires the car.

<b>ttttLAMPONE
</b>ttNice.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttCrazy Detroit delivered it with a
ttwooden bumper.  They're going to
ttsend me the chrome bumpers in a
ttcouple months.  I waited two years
ttfor this car to come with wooden
ttbumpers!

tHe scrubs and polishes with great affection.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttToday you make your bones on Paulie.
ttYou understand everything?

<b>ttttLAMPONE
</b>ttSure.

tAs he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,
tunwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>tt.22 soft-nosed load.  Accurate up
ttto five feet.

tLAMPONE expertly puts the gun away.  GATTO's car pulls into
tthe driveway, and he sounds the horn.

tThe two men walk to the car.  GATTO is driving, a bit
tnervous, like he doesn't know what is up.  LAMPONE gets in
tthe rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of
trecognition.  He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting
tto chide PAULIE for being late.  PAULIE flinches a little
twhen he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttRocco, sit on the other side.  A
ttbig guy like you blocks my rearview
ttmirror.

tCLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttGoddamn Sonny.  He's running scared.
ttHe's already thinking of going to
ttthe mattresses.  We have to find a
ttplace on the West Side.  Paulie,
ttyou know a good location?

tPAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook
the was on.  Also there's the money he can make by selling
tSollozzo any secret location.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttI'll think about it.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttt  (grunting)
ttDrive while you thinking; I wanna

tThe car pulls out.

tThe Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter
tlight.

tHe tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttPay attention!

<b>tEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

</b>ttGood for ten men...

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttOK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm

tNew part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.
tCLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttYou wait; I'll call.

tHe walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the
tcorner and enters the Luna Restaurant.

<b>tINT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tCLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.
tThe WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some
tbread--and then a plate of veal on his table.  He eats.

<b>tEXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tCLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;
the is well fed.

tWe move with him around the corner, not knowing what to
texpect has happened to Paulie.

tThere is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,
tLAMPONE in the rear seat.  CLEMENZA steps in.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttHe talked my ear off.  Want us to
ttgo back to Long Beach; have another
ttjob for us.  Rocco, you live in the
ttCity, can we drop you off?

<b>ttttLAMPONE (O.S.)
</b>ttAh, I left my car at your place.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttOK, then you gotta come back.

tThe car pulls out.  By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and
tsecure.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttYou think we'll go for that last
ttplace?

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttMaybe, or you gotta know now.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttHoly cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

<b>tEXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tThe car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.
tInside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttPaulie, pull over.  I gotta take a
ttleak.

tThe car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA
tsteps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

tHe turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer
tsee the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting
tthe ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there
tare two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and
tturns, moving back to the car.

tPAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind
thim are shattered.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttLeave the gun.

tLAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few
tfeet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off.

</b>
<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tHIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange
tcars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group
tof BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries
twith concealed weapons.

tMICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.

tHe is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the
tstrange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They
tlook back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the
trespect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He
twanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.

tA rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground
tequipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This
tis where he was a child.  Then a shout.

tCLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL
thurries into the house.

tHe points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the

</b>ttI can't...

<b>ttttKAY (O.S.)
</b>ttPlease say it.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttLook.  I'll see you tonight, OK?

</b>ttGoodbye.

<b>tEXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tA taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with
ta neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."  MICHAEL steps out, pays
tthe fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.

tMICHAEL looks.

tHe sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted.  He
tis the only one on the street.  There are gay, twinkling
tChristmas decorations all over the building.  He walks,
tslowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.  He
thesitates, looks around.  This area is empty.  He checks the
taddress on a scrap of paper.  It is correct.  He tries the
tdoor, it is empty.

tHe walks in.

<b>tINT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tMICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital
tlobby.  He looks to the right; there is a long, empty
tcorridor.  To the left: the same.

tHIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated
tbuilding lit by eerie green neon lighting.  All we hear are
this sole footsteps.

tHe walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION".  No one is there.
tHe moves quickly to a door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it;
tno one is there.  He looks onto the desk:  There is half a
tsandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHello?  Hello?

tNow he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,
talertly.  MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all
talone.  The floors have just been mopped.  They are still wet.

<b>tINT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS
</b>
tNow he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several
tflights.

<b>tINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR
</b>
tHe steps out onto the fourth floor.  He looks.  There are
tmerely empty corridors.  He takes out his scrap of paper;
tchecks it.  "Room 4A."  Now he hurries, trying to follow the
tcode of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker
tand quicker they flash by him.  Now he stops, looks up "4A--
tCorleone".

tThere is a special card table set up there with some
tmagazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the
tashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

<b>tINT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A
</b>
tSlowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he
twill find.  He looks.  Lit by the moonlight through the
twindow, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the
troom, and under a transparent oxygen tent.  All that can be
theard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly
tMICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,
tsecurely asleep.  Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the
tbed, and run to his nose and mouth.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttWhat are you doing here?

tThis startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.  It is a

<b>ttttNURSE
</b>ttYou're not supposed to be here now.

tMICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

<b>ttttNURSE
</b>ttOh your father just had too many

<b>ttttNURSE
</b>ttt  (frightened)
ttWe don't have to disconnect them,

tShe does so...and they perform the very difficult task of
tmoving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.

<b>tINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tThey roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently
tdown the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
tMICHAEL hears them, stops.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHurry, into there.

tThey push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks
tout from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they
temerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet
tof flowers.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (stepping out)
ttWho is it?

<b>ttttENZO
</b>ttMichael...do you remember me, Enzo,
ttthe baker's helper to Nazorine, now

</b>ttEnzo, get out of here.  There's

tA look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

<b>ttttENZO
</b>ttIf there...will be trouble...I stay
ttwith you, to help.  I owe it to the

tput his FATHER.

<b>ttttNURSE

ttHe's awake.

tMICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he
tcannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttPop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh,
ttdon't try to speak.  There are men
ttwho are coming to try to kill you.

tputs his finger to his FATHER's lips.

<b>tEXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tOutside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,
tpacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only
tweapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They
tboth stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.
tThey are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,
tlights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttGet rid of those and look like
ttyou've got a gun in your pocket.

tThe windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas
tdecorations.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttListen...

tWe HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL
tand ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes
tthe bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.
tThey stand, hands in their pockets.

tA long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.
tMICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car
tseems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.
tMICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the
tBAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they
tare not.

tAnother moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of
tpolice sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital,
tgetting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.

tIn a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of
tthe hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed
tPOLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts
ttoward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his
tarms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,
tspattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,
twith beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is
tMcCLUSKEY.

ttHow much is the Turk paying you to

tWithout any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL
tsquarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.
tMICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at
tMcCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and
the falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S
tMEN arrive.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tHIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a
tlong black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN
tstationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying
trifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN
tstanding by open windows.  It is clear that the war is
tescalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,
tMICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He
tstops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN
tholding rifles.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttChrist, Sonny really means business.

tThey continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various
tBODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttHow come all the new men?

<b>ttttTESSIO
</b>ttWe'll need them now.  After the
tthospital incident, Sonny got mad.
ttWe hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock
ttthis morning.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY
</b>
tThey enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tSONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttI've got a hundred button men on
ttthe streets twenty-four hours a day.
ttIf Sollozzo shows one hair on his
ttass he's dead.

tHe sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,
tkiddingly.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttMikey, you look beautiful!

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttCut it out.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttThe Turk wants to talk!  The nerve
ttof that son of a bitch!  After he
ttcraps out last night he wants a meet.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWas there a definite proposal?

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttSure, he wants us to send Mike to
ttmeet him to hear his proposition.
ttThe promise is the deal will be so
ttgood we can't refuse.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWhat about that Tattaglias?  What
ttwill they do about Bruno?

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttPart of the deal: Bruno cancels out
ttwhat they did to my father.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWe should hear what they have to say.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttNo, no Consiglere.  Not this time.
ttNo more meetings, no more
ttdiscussions, no more Sollozzo
tttricks.  Give them one message: I
ttWANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all
ttout war.  We go to the mattresses
ttand we put all the button men out
tton the street.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThe other families won't sit still
ttfor all out war.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttThen THEY hand me Sollozzo.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttCome ON Sonny, your father wouldn't
ttwant to hear this.  This is not a
ttpersonal thing, this is Business.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttAnd when they shot me father...

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttYes, even the shooting of your
ttfather was business, not personal...

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttNo no, no more advice on how to
ttpatch it up Tom.  You just help me
ttwin.  Understood?

tHAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI found out about this Captain
ttMcCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
ttHe's definitely on Sollozzo's
ttpayroll, and for big money.
ttMcCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's
ttbodyguard.  What you have to
ttunderstand is that while Sollozzo
ttis guarded like this, he's
ttinvulnerable.  Nobody has ever
ttgunned down a New York Police
ttCaptain.  Never.  It would be
ttdisastrous.  All the five families
ttwould come after you Sonny; the
ttCorleone family would be outcasts;
tteven the old man's political
ttprotection would run for cover.  So
ttjust...take that into consideration.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttt  (still fuming)
ttMcCluskey can't stay with the Turk
ttforever.  We'll wait.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWe can't wait.  No matter what
ttSollozzo say about a deal, he's
ttfiguring out how to kill Pop.  You
tthave to get Sollozzo now.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttThe kid's right.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWhat about McCluskey?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttLet's say now that we have to kill
ttMcCluskey.  We'll clear that up
ttthrough our Newspaper contacts later.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttGo on Mike.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThey want me to go to the conference
ttwith Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting
ttfor two days from now.  Sonny, get
ttour informers to find out where the
ttmeeting will be held.
ttInsist it has to be a public place:
tta bar or restaurant at the height
ttof the dinner hour.  So I'll feel
ttsafe.  They'll check me when I meet
ttthem so I won't be able to carry a
ttweapon; but Clemenza, figure out a
ttway to have one planted there for
ttme.
ttt  (pause)
ttThen I'll kill them both.

tEveryone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.
tSilence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He points
ta finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttYou?  You, the high-class college
ttkid.  You never wanted to get mixed
ttup in the family business.  Now you
ttwanta gun down a police Captain and
ttthe Turk just because you got
ttslapped in the face.  You're taking
ttit personal, it's just business and
tthe's taking it personal.

tNow CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps
this face serious.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (angrily, but cold)
ttSonny, it's all personal, and I
ttlearned it from him, the old man,
ttthe Godfather.  He took my joining
ttthe Marines personal.  I take
ttSollozzo trying to kill my father
ttpersonal, and you know I'll kill

tMICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA (O.S.)
</b>ttIt's as cold as they come,

tMICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttJust let your hand drop to your
ttside, and let the gun slip out.
ttEverybody will still think you got
ttit.  They'll be starin' at your

ttlook.  Helps with identification.

tThey put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttMostly it gives witnesses an excuse
ttto change their identification when
ttwe make them see the light.  Then
ttyou take a long vacation and we
ttcatch the hell.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHow bad will it be?

</b>ttProbably all the other families

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

tMICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house.  A card
ttable is set up with a man playing cards with three of the
tCorleone buttonmen.

tHe continues into the living room.  It's a mess.  SONNY
tasleep on the sofa.  On the coffee table are the remains of
ta take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of
twhisky.  The radio is playing.

tHAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS
tmove in.

tHAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttOne of Tattaglia's people?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttNo.  Our informer in McCluskey's

ttt  and makes a crude drawing)
ttThis is the entrance, Mike.  When
ttyou finish just walk out and turn
ttleft, then turn the corner.
ttClemenza, you gotta work fast to

</b>
tThe enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands
tMICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat
tCLEMENZA had given him.  A long black car pulls around the
tcorner and slows before him.  The DRIVER, leaning over, open
tthe front door.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttGet in, Mike.

tHe does, the car drives off.

<b>tEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tInside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat
tand shakes MIKE's hand.

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttI'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we
ttcan straighten everything out.  All
ttthis is terrible, it's not the way
ttI wanted things to happen at all.
ttIt should never have happened.

</b>ttI want to settle things tonight.  I
ttwant my father left alone.

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttHe won't be; I swear to you be my
ttchildren he won't be.  Just keep an
ttopen mind when we talk.  I hope

tMcCLUSKEY grunts.

<b>ttttMCCLUSKEY
</b>ttHe's a good kid.  He's all right.
ttTurn around, up on your knees,
ttfacing me.

tHe gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.

</b>ttI'm sorry about the other night
ttMike.  I'm getting too old for my

ttaggravation.  You know how it is.
ttHe's clean.

<b>tEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tMICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where
tthey're heading.

tThe car takes the George Washington Bridge.  MICHAEL is
tconcerned.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWe're going to New Jersey?

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttt  (sly)
ttMaybe.

tMICHAEL closes his eyes.

<b>tEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tThe car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way
tto New Jersey.  Then suddenly it hits the divider,
ttemporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the
tlanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on
tthe way back to the city.

<b>tEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tSOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and
tthen leans to the DRIVER.

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttNice work; I'll remember it.

tMICHAEL is relieved.

<b>tEXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tThe car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in
tthe Bronx:  The "LUNA AZURA".  There is no one on the street.
tMICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with
tthem.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY
tand MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the
tcar.  They enter the restaurant.

<b>tINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tA very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.
tSOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small
tround table near the center of the room.  There are empty
tbooths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,
tand ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.

<b>ttttMCCLUSKEY
</b>ttIs the Italian food good here?

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttTry the veal; it's the finest in
ttNew York.

tThe solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.
tThey watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three
tglasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttI am going to talk Italian to Mike.

<b>ttttMCCLUSKEY
</b>ttSure, you two go right ahead; I'll
ttconcentrate on my veal and my
ttspaghetti.

tSOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening
tcarefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers
tin Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally
tbrings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.
tThen MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in
tItalian, accidentally lapses into English.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (using English for emphasis)
ttMost important...I want a sure
ttguarantee that no more attempts
ttwill be made on my father's life.

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttWhat guarantees can I give you?  I
ttam the hunted one.  I've missed my
ttchance.  You think too highly of
ttme, my friend...I am not so
ttclever...all I want if a truce...

tMICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling
tholding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up
tmy sleeve".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look
ton his face.

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttWhat is it?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIs it all right if I go to the
ttbathroom?

tSOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with
this dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's
tthigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.

<b>ttttMCCLUSKEY
</b>ttI frisked him; I've frisked
ttthousands of young punks; he's clean.

tHe looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;
tindicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods,
tindicating no one is there.

<b>ttttSOLLOZZO
</b>ttDon't take too long.

tMICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and
tdisappears inside.

<b>tINT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tMICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very
thard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his
thands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.
tThen he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.
tSlowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he
tcannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is
tjust a few inches from the gun...he gropes
tsearchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.

tCLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he
tbreaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep
tbreath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some
tunexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately
twashes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.

<b>tINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)
</b>
tHe hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.
tMcCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO
tturns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at
tMICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues
tback to the table.  He sits down.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNow I can talk.  I feel much better.

tThe MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now
the too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down
tcomfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton
this jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again
tbut MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear
thim.

tThe WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to
tspeak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away
tfrom him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts
tthe gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his
ttemple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's
thead blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the
tentire area.

tThe WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is
tsprayed and stained with blood.

tSOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he
tseems to hang in space suspended.

tMICHAEL pivots, and looks:

tThere is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal
tsuspended in air before his gaping mouth.

tMICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging
tthroat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then
tcoolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right
tthrough McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

tThe air is filled with pink mist.
tMICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.
tHe does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.
tNow he carefully shows his hands to be empty.
tThe WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an
texpression of horror on his face.
tMICHAEL looks at his two victims:
tSOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by
tthe table.
tMcCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.
tMICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His
thand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.
tHe moves, not letting the gun go.

tMICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.

tHis hand: still holding the gun.

tHis face: finally he closes his eyes.

tHis hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.

tHe walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.

tHe sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had
tbeen recreated in wax.

tThen he leaves.

tSeveral cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York
tapartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's
tbodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards
tagainst the curb.

tInside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of
tbrass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

tUp one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,

tThe man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.

tSONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI
twrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she
tdraws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he
tcomes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

tHe jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard
ton the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The
tmen quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car:

</b>ttPick up your sister?

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttYeah.

tThe car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the
tbodyguards in their cars.

</b>
tHe knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again.

<b>ttttCONNIE'S VOICE
</b>ttWho is it?

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttIt's me, Sonny.

tWe hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY
tenters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her
tback to him.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttt  (tenderly)
ttConnie, what is it?

tHe turns her around in his arms.

tHer face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her
trough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.
tAs soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red
twith rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing
thim from running out of the apartment.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttt  (desperately)
ttIt was my fault!  I started a fight
ttwith him and I tried to hit him so
tthe hit me.  He didn't even try to
tthit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.

tSonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder,
tthe thin silk robe.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttI'm goin' to have the doctor come
ttover and take a look at you.

tHe starts to leave.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttOh Sonny, please don't do anything.
ttPlease don't.

tHe stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttHey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do?
ttMake your kid a orphan before he's
ttborn.

tShe laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

<b>tEXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET
</b>
tCARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.
t"Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking
tbeer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the
tcorner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the
tkids on the street are still playing stickball.

tCARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street
tsuddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block
tand to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires
tscream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a
tMAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast
tthe everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we
trecognize that it is SONNY.

tHis face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on
tthe stoop and has CARLO by the throat.

tHe pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down
tinto the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,
tand hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to
thide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.
tHis shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.

tSALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

tSONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,
tin a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His
tblows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

tThe kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching
tin fascination.

tCARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.

tSONNY beats him mercilessly.

tNow SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become
tspectators.

tSONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into
tCARLO's face and body.

tCARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does
tnothing, other than hang onto the railing.

tSONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag
thim off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in
tthe effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;
teven biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go.

tIt's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will
tnot be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him
tmore; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he
tstammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttYou...bastard...You...hurt my
ttsister... again...and I'll
ttkill...you.

tHe wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.
tand hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,
tleaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN
twith a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially
tinterested.

tCARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.  He slumps
tonto the stoop.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tHIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.  It is a gray, rainy day.
tYoung BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of
tvarious points around the main house and compound.  Things
thave changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new
tand secure gate house has been built.  Security measures
tthat had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made
ta permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval
tFortress.  We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the
tresult of a recent bomb attempt.  The house nearest the
tcrater is damaged by fire.

tA taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright
tyellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the
tshelter of the gate house.

tThey are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they
tcall the main house.

tKAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still
truns down onto her face.

tShe notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the
tsullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.

tTOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttKay, we weren't expecting you.  You

</b>ttI've tried calling and writing.  I
ttwant to reach Michael.

</b>ttNobody knows where he is.  We know
tthe's all right, but that's all.

tKAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with
trainwater.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhat was that?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttAn accident.  No one was hurt.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttListen Tom, I let my cab go; can I
ttcome in to call another one?

tTOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has
tto.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttSure...I'm sorry.

tThey hurry through the rain and into the Main House.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tIn the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and
ttakes her rainhat off.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWill you give this to him.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttIf I accept that letter and you
tttold a Court of Law I accepted it,
ttthey would interpret it as my
tthaving knowledge of his whereabouts.
ttJust wait Kay, he'll contact you.

tWe hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE
tenters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttYou're Mikey's little girl.

tKAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttYou eat anything?

tKAY shakes her head.

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttt  (to HAGEN)
ttDisgrazia, you don't even give the
ttpoor girl a cup of coffee?

tHAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves
ttoward MAMA, the letter extended.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWill you give this letter to Michael.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttMama, no.

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttYou tell me what to do?  Even he
ttdon't tell me what to do.

tShe takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhy did they blame Michael?

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttYou listen to me, you go home to
ttyour family, and you find a good
ttyoung man and get married.  Forget
ttabout Mikey; he's no good for you,
ttanymore.

tShe looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what
tthat means.

<b>tEXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tA hospital in New York City.  POLICE and teams of PRIVATE
tDETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area.  An ambulance
twith a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the
thospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL
tASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying
tthe DON.

tTESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing
tup the rear.  HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a
tmoment they disappear behind the ambulance.  Then suddenly,
tsiren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung
tcars.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

tThe Corleone Mall.

tEqually impressive security stands ready at the Corleone
tMall.  EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE

</b>
tIt all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.
tAll is silent.  The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday

tOne ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,

tAll the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tThe DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but
tbeen converted into a hospital room, with complete and
textensive equipment.  The various CHILDREN get a turn to
tkiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then
tSONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO
tshould leave.

tThey do, the door is closed.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tThe mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the

tCARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttWhat's the matter, Carlo?

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttShut up.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tAll the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with
tgrim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.  The DON
tdoes not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and
tglances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is
tthe spokesman for the family.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>tt...since McCluskey's killing, the
ttpolice have cracked down on most of
ttour operations...on the other
ttfamilies too.  There's been a lot

</b>ttWe put out a lot of material
ttthrough our contacts in the

ttFrancesco of L.A.  I want him to
ttrest...

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttI'm goin' to learn the casino

tThe DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room
tfor a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttMichael...
ttt  (he takes a breath)
ttIt was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

tThe DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and
trage.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttHe's safe now...we're already
ttworking on ways to bring him back.

tThe DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they
tleave him alone.

tHAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is
texpansive and optimistic.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttYou lousy tramp bitch.

tShe slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the
tbathroom drying his golden body.

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttWhat was that?

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttYour girl friend.  She says she
ttcan't make it tonight.  You lousy
ttbastard you have the nerve to give
ttyour whores my telephone number.
ttI'll kill you, you bastard!

tShe hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then
tshe flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy
tbelly heaving under the thin slip.

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttt  (defending himself)
ttYou're crazy.  She was kidding
ttaround; I don't know, some nut.

tHe pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttYou're staying home.  You're not
ttgoing out.

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttOK, OK.  You gonna make me something
ttto eat at least?

tThat calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing
theavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and
tstarts her wifely duties.

tCARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in
tthe doorway.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttThe food is on the table.

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttI'm not hungry yet.

</b>ttBa Fa Goulle.

</b><b>ttBA FA GOULE YOU!

tShe turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen.  A moment
tlater we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking.  CARLO
tslowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically
tsmashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy
tveal and peppers all over the apartment floor.

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttYou filthy guinea spoiled brat.
ttClean it up or I'll kick your head

<b>ttttCONNIE

the slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in
this hand.

</b>ttClean it up!

tHe swings the belt against her heavy hips.  She moves back
tinto the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it
tready.

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttEven the female Corleones are
ttmurderers.

tHe puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her.  She
tmakes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids.  He
tpulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process.  She
tgets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,
tgets her; and starts to slap her in the face.

tShe breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.

tunder the bed.

tHe reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.

tHe slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he
tthrows her on the bed, contemptuously.  He grabs part of her
tthigh, pinching it very hard.

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttYou're fat as a pig.

</b>ttMama...mama, it's Connie.  Mama, I

tBONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE
tsees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.

tSilently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows
tsomething serious is happening, and never takes her eyes
tfrom him.  He lights a cigarette.

tBONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without
tturning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,
tpast the tables, and equipment.  He operates the chain that
tlifts a large overhead garage type door.  And looks out into
tthe alley.

tHe sits on a bench, and waits.

twe notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral
tparlor.

tCLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.
tBONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.  He notices TWO
tOTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a
tCORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet
tprotruding.

tBONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way
tthe MEN should carry their sinister burden.

<b>tINT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

tThen BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the
tdarkness somewhat uncertainly.  It is DON CORLEONE.

tHe walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.  His
tcold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.
tThen, after a long gaze:

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWell my friend, are you ready to do
ttme this service?

tBONASERA nods.  The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming
ttable; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.

<b>ttttBONASERA
</b>ttWhat do you wish me to do?

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttt  (staring at the table)
ttI want you to use all your powers,

thim, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll
tbooths on both side of him, and from the front window of the
tcar blocking him.

tThe windows of his car are shot out.

tBullet holes puncture the doors of his car.

tView on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room.  He is silent
ta moment, and then:

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt  (quietly)
ttOK.  Go to Clemenza's house and
tttell him to come here right away.
ttHe'll tell you what to do.

tThe MEN leave him alone.  He is quiet, standing in the
tmiddle of the living room a moment.  He looks in the
tdirection of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA
tmoving around.

<b>tINT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tTOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the
tDON's room.  He opens the DON's door.  Looks in.

<b>tINT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tThe DON in his hospital bed.  Asleep under sedation.  HAGEN
thesitates.  He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN.  He
tcloses the door.

<b>tINT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tHAGEN alone in the office.  He is drinking.  He looks up at
tthe sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving.  Then he
thears footsteps.

tThe door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE
tslowly enters the room.  He walks directly to his stuffed
tarmchair, sits down.  His face is stern, as he looks into
tHAGEN's eyes.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttGive me a drop of anisette.

tHAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttMy wife was weeping before she fell
ttasleep, outside my window I saw my
ttcaporegimes to the house, and it is
ttmidnight.  So, Consigliere of mine,
ttI think you should tell your Don
ttwhat everyone knows.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt  (quietly)
ttI didn't tell Mama anything.  I was
ttabout to come up and wake you and
tttell you.  Just now.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttBut you needed a drink first.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttNow you've had your drink.

tPause.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThey shot Sonny on the Causeway.
ttt  (pause)
ttHe's dead.

tDON CORLEONE blinks.  One feels that just for a second he
tloses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of
thim on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttI want no inquiries made.  No acts
ttof vengeance.
ttt  (pause)
ttConsigliere, arrange a meeting with
ttthe heads of the five
ttfamilies...this war stops now.

tHe rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttCall Bonasera...he will do me a
ttservice.

tAnd leaves.  HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThis is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for
ttDon Corleone, at his request.

<b>ttttBONASERA (O.S.)
</b>ttYes, I understand I'm listening.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttYou owe the Don a service.  He has
ttno doubt that you will repay it.

<b>tEXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tDay in Manhattan.  An impressive Bank Building in the
tfinancial center of New York.  Many limousines are parked,
tuniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

<b>tINT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tThe Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.

tCARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,
tsits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a
tMAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and
tsettles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;
tas the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE (O.S.)
</b>ttI want to thank you all for coming.
ttI consider it a service done to me
ttpersonally and I am in the debt of
tteach and every one of you.
ttEspecially those of you who have
tttraveled from such distances as
ttCalifornia, St. Louis, Kansas City;
ttand New Orleans...

tThe VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both
tyounger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,
tshort and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the
ttable to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his
tJEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an
tolder man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO
tCUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then
tDON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair
tand a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his
tearly sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at
tCONNIE's Wedding.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttAh well, let's get down to business.
ttWe are all honorable men here, we
ttdon't have to give assurances as if
ttwe were lawyers.
ttt  (he sits, gazes out
ttt  at them, and sighs)
ttHow did things ever go so far?
ttWell, no matter.  A lot of
ttfoolishness has come to pass.  It
ttwas so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

tThe VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks.  A
tlarge, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,
tand two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during
tthe day's trading, and projected above.

tDON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttTattaglia has lost a son; I have
ttlost a son.  We are quits.  Let
ttthere be a peace...
ttt  (he gestures
ttt  expressively,
ttt  submissively, with
ttt  his hands)
ttThat is all I want...

<b>ttttBARZINI
</b>ttDon Corleone is too modest.  He had
ttthe judges and politicians in his
ttpocket and he refused to share them.
ttHis refusal is not the act of a
ttfriend.  He takes the bread out of
ttthe mouths of our families.  Times
tthave changed, it's not like the old
ttdays where everyone can go his own
ttway.  If Don Corleone had all the
ttjudges and politicians in New York,
ttthen he must share them or let
ttothers use them.  Certainly he can
ttpresent a bill for such services,
ttwe're not Communists, after all.
ttBut he has to let us draw water
ttfrom the well.  It's that simple.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttMy friends, I didn't refuse out of
ttmalice.  You all know me.  When
tthave I ever refused an accommodation?
ttBut why, this time?  Because I
ttthink this drug business will
ttdestroy us in the years to come.
ttIt's not like whiskey or gambling
ttor even women which most people
ttwant and is forbidden them by the
ttpezzonovante of the Church and the
ttGovernment.  But drugs?  No.  Even
ttpolicemen, who help us in gambling
ttand other things would refuse to
tthelp us in drugs.  But...I am
ttwilling to do whatever all of you
ttthink is necessary.

<b>ttttDON ZALUCHI
</b>ttI don't believe in drugs.  For
ttyears I paid my people extra so
ttthey wouldn't do that kind of
ttbusiness...$200 a week.  But it
ttdidn't matter.  Somebody comes to
ttthem and says, "I have powders, if
ttyou put up three, four thousand
ttdollar investment, we can make
ttfifty thousand distributing."  Who
ttcan resist such a profit?
ttThere's no way to control it, as a
ttbusiness...to keep it respectable.
ttt  (rapping the table)
ttI don't want it near schools!  I
ttdon't want it sold to children.
ttThat is an infamita.
ttt  (thinking)
ttIn my city I would try to keep the
tttraffic in the dark people, the
ttcolored.  They are the best
ttcustomers, the least troublesome,
ttand they are animals anyway.  They
tthave no respect for their wives or
tttheir families or themselves.  Let
ttthem lose their souls with drugs.
ttBut something has to be done, we
ttcan't have everybody running around
ttdoing just what they please, like a
ttbunch of anarchists.

<b>ttttBARZINI
</b>ttThen, are we agreed; the traffic in
ttdrugs will be permitted, but
ttcontrolled; and Don Corleone agrees
ttto give it protection in the East.

tDON CORLEONE nods.

<b>ttttBARZINI
</b>ttThat's the whole matter then, we
tthave the peace, and let me pay my
ttrespects to Don Corleone, whom we
tthave all known over the years as a
ttman of his word.
ttt  (noticing TATTAGLIA
ttt  is uneasy)
ttDon Philip?

<b>ttttTATTAGLIA
</b>ttI agree to everything here, I'm
ttwilling to forget my own misfortune.
ttBut I must hear strict assurance
ttfrom Corleone.  When time goes by
ttand his position becomes stronger,
ttwill he attempt any individual
ttvengeance?

tThey all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that
tDON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something
telse in mind.  Slowly the DON rises.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttI forego my vengeance for my dead
ttson, for the common good.  But I
tthave selfish reasons.  My youngest
ttson had to flee, accused of
ttSollozzo's murder, and I must now
ttmake arrangements so that he can
ttcome home with safety, cleared of
ttall those false charges.  That is
ttmy affair, and I will make those
ttarrangements.
ttt  (with strength)
ttBut I am a superstitious man...and
ttso if some unlucky accident should
ttbefall my youngest son, if some
ttpolice officer should accidentally
ttshoot him, or if he should hang
tthimself in his cell, or if my son
ttis struck by a bolt of lightning,
ttthen I will blame some of the
ttpeople here.  That, I could never
ttforgive, but...aside from that, let
ttme swear by the souls of my
ttGrandchildren that I will never be
ttthe one to break the peace we have
ttmade.

<b>tEXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)
</b>
tThe DON's black limousine.  He sits quietly in the padded
trear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

tIt is night.  Lights flash by them every so often.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWhen I meet with Tattaglia's
ttpeople; should I insist that all
tthis drug middle-men be clean?

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttMention it, don't insist.  Barzini
ttis a man who will know that without
ttbeing told.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttYou mean Tattaglia.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttt  (shaking his head)
ttBarzini.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt  (a revelation)
ttHe was the one behind Sollozzo?

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttTattaglia is a pimp.  He could
ttnever have outfought Santino.  But
ttI wasn't sure until this day.  No,
ttit was Barzini all along.

tThe black limousine speeds away from us in the night.

</b>
<b>tEXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT
</b>
tA CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and
tdowncast, the left side of his face healed, but left
tgrotesque and misshapen.

tGRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea
tjacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.

tTHE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on
teither side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his
tshoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple
thonest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,
tand with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry
tknapsacks.

tThe THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,
toverlooking an impressive view of land and sea.

<b>tEXT DAY: SICILY ROAD
</b>
tThe THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make
ttheir way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn
tsound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.
tAn OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The
tcar pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods
trespectfully.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttDon Tommassino.

<b>ttttDON TOMMASSINO
</b>ttMichael, why must you do this.  We
tthave been lucky so far, all these
ttmonths you've been here we've kept
ttyour name a secret.  It is from
ttlove for your father that I've
ttasked you never to more than an
tthour from the Villa.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttCalo and Fabrizzio are with me;
ttnothing will happen.

<b>ttttDON TOMMASSINO
</b>ttYou must understand that your
ttFather's enemies have friends in
ttPalermo.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI know.

<b>ttttDON TOMMASSINO
</b>ttWhere are you going?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttCorleone.

<b>ttttDON TOMMASSINO
</b>ttThere is nothing there.  Not anymore.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI was told that my Grandfather was
ttmurdered on its main street; and
tthis murderers came to kill my
ttfather there when he was twelve
ttyears old.

<b>ttttDON TOMMASSINO
</b>ttLong ago.  Now there is nothing:
ttthe men killed each other in family
ttvendettas...the others escaped to
ttAmerica.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttDon Tommassino...I should see this
ttplace.

tDON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.

<b>ttttDON TOMMASSINO
</b>ttThat is your birthright...but
ttMichael, use this car.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo...I would like to walk to
ttCorleone.

tThe OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

<b>ttttDON TOMMASSINO
</b>ttBe careful Michael, don't let them
ttknow your name.

tThe old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues
ton his journey.

<b>tEXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE
</b>
tThe THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit
ttrees, in bloom and bursting with life.

<b>tEXT DAY: VILLAGE
</b>
tThey continue in the empty streets of a little town; the
tpost-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the
tempty streets.  Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only
tgasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.  And there
tare many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

tThe THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main
troad "VOTA COMMUNISTA".

<b>tEXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD
</b>
tThey continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally
ta donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.

<b>tEXT DAY: FIELD
</b>
tOut in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession
tof peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,
tmarching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men
tcarrying billowing red banners.

<b>tEXT DAY: GROVE
</b>
tThey are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees
tis a deep, tall field of wild flowers.

tThe Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out
tloaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

tMICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttYou tell us about America.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHow do you know I come from America?

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttWe hear.  We were told you were a
ttPezzonovanta...big shot.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttOnly the son of a Pezzonovanta.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttHey America!  Is she as rich as
ttthey say?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttTake me to America!  You need a
ttgood lupara in America?
ttt  (pats his shotgun)
ttYou take me, I'll be the best man
ttyou got.  "Oh say, can you
ttseeee...By da star early light..."

tMICHAEL laughs.

<b>tEXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD
</b>
tThe TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military
tconvoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of
tthe U.S. drivers, as they move by.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttAmerica.
ttHey America!
ttTake me with you!
ttHey, take me to America G.I.!

<b>tEXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL
</b>
tThey continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until
tthey hesitate, and look down.

<b>ttttCALO
</b>ttCorleone.

tThey can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

<b>tEXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET
</b>
tMICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of
tthe village.  They walk behind him, and spread to either
tside about fifteen feet away from him.

tThey move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.
tMICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.
tThey go on.

tThey move up a very narrow old street.  MICHAEL looks at the
tdoorways that they pass.

tMOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.

tCALO sees MICHAEL looking.

<b>ttttCALO
</b>ttThe names of the dead.

tMICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street.  He looks.

tThe street is empty, barren.  Occasionally, an old woman
twill pass.

tMICHAEL turns his head.

tThe other side of the street: empty and deathly.

tA HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old
tstreet, the shepherds a respectful distance away.

<b>t-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------
</b>
<b>tEXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE
</b>
tA green ribboned field of a baronial Estate.  Further ahead
tis a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been
tdiscovered in the ruins of Pompeii.  There is a group of
tyoung village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,
tdressed in black.  They have been gathering the pink sulla,
tpurple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon
tblossoms.  They are singing, off in the distance as they work.

tMICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this
tFantasy-like scene.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttt  (calling out to them)
ttHey, beautiful girls!

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (sternly)
ttShhhhh.

tHe settles down to watch.

tThe GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that
tcling to their bodies.  They are still in their teens, but
tdeveloped and womanly.

tThey are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not
taware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.
tThree or four of the girls begin chasing one of them
tplayfully, in the direction of the grove.

tThe GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her
tleft hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws
tthem back at her pursuers laughing.

tThey come closer and closer.  Just short of the grove, she
tposes, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the
tview of the THREE MEN.  She stands there on her toes about
tto run.

tMICHAEL sees her; now face to face.  He looks.

tHer face.  Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair
tand a rich mouth.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttt  (murmuring)
ttJesus Christ, take my soul.  I'm
ttdying.

tQuickly, she turns, and runs away.

tMICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her.  We hold
ton him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS
tlaughing.  Then he turns to them.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttYou got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?

tCALO pats him on the shoulder.

<b>ttttCALO
</b>ttEasy man.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttYou can't hide it when you're hit
ttby the thunderbolt.

<b>tEXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE
</b>
tThe little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,
tis decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.

tMICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central
tsquare, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.

tThe proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;
the greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at
ttheir table.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttYou know all the girls in this
tttown, eh?  We saw some beauties
ttcoming down the road.  One in
ttparticular got our friend hit with
ttthe Thunderbolt...
ttt  (he indicates MICHAEL)

tVITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with
tnew interest.

<b>ttttVITELLI
</b>ttYou had better bring a few bottles
tthome with you, my friend; you'll
ttneed help sleeping tonight.
ttt  (he laughs)

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttThis one could seduce the devil.  A
ttbody! and eyes as big and black as
ttolives.

<b>ttttVITELLI
</b>ttt  (laughing with
ttt  them...pouring more wine)
ttI know about what you mean!

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttThis was a beauty.  Right, Calo?

<b>ttttVITELLI
</b>ttt  (laughing)
ttBeautiful all over, eh?

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttAnd hair.  Black and curly, like a
ttdoll.  And such a mouth.

tVITELLI does not laugh quite so much.

<b>ttttVITELLI
</b>ttYes, we have beautiful girls here...
ttbut virtuous.

tVITELLI is no longer drinking with them.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttShe wore a red dress, and a red
ttribbon in her hair.  She looks more
ttGreek than Italian.  Do you know a
ttbeauty like that?

tAs MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,
tuntil he wears a scowl.

<b>ttttVITELLI
</b>ttNo.

tThen he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttGod in Heaven, I think I
ttunderstand...

tHe goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he
treturns.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttLet's get out of here; he's boiling
ttup his blood to do us mischief.
ttIt's his daughter.

tThey start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

<b>ttttCALO
</b>ttCome quickly.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttInnkeeper.  More wine!

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttt  (whispered)
ttThe old bastard mentioned two sons
tthe only has to whistle up.

tMICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTell him to come to me.

tThe two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in
ta moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI
tbetween them.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (quietly)
ttI understand I've offended you by
tttalking about your daughter.  I
ttoffer you my apologies, I'm a
ttstranger in this country, I don't
ttknow the customs very well.  Let me
ttsay this, I meant no disrespect to
ttyou or her...

tCALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.

<b>ttttVITELLI
</b>ttt  (shrugs)
ttWho are you and what do you want
ttfrom my daughter?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI am an American hiding in Sicily
ttfrom the police of my country.  My
ttname is Michael.  You can inform
ttthe police and make your fortune
ttbut then your daughter would lose a
ttfather rather than gain a husband.
ttIn any case, I want to meet your
ttdaughter.  With your permission and
ttunder the supervision of your
ttfamily.  With all decorum.  With
ttall respect.  I am an honorable man.

tCALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then
tasks:

<b>ttttVITELLI
</b>ttAre you a friend of the friends?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWhen the proper time comes, I'll
tttell you everything that a wife's
ttfather should know.

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttIt's the real Thunderbolt, then.

<b>ttttVITELLI
</b>ttt  (formally)
ttCome Sunday morning:  My name is

<b>tEXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD
</b>
tMUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from
tPalermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an
tAlfa Romeo.  CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday
tbest, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their
tluparas on their shoulders.

tDON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,
trocky and bouncing on the dirt road.

tThe Sunday churchbells ring.

tthe yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the
tMOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.
tFinally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate
tSunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to
tAPPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives
ther permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light

tThey go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is
ttalking and talking.

tMICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.
tShe wears the gold necklace around her neck.

<b>t--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------
</b>
<b>tEXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME
</b>
tMICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,
tseemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.

tAs the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a
thalf dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces
tfurther behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on
ttheir shoulders.

tFurther up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,
tand falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm.  She modestly regains
ther balance, and they continue walking.

tBehind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

<b>t--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------
</b>
<b>tEXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH
</b>
tChurch bells in an ancient belfry ring out.  Music, old and
tdissonant, plays.

tThere is a bridal procession in the street of the village;
tthe same in feeling and texture as it might have been five
thundred years ago.

tDonkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant
tflowers; children carrying candles and wearing white
tconfirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by
tcountless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.

tWe present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with
tall the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in
tSicily.

tAPPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome
tdespite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

</b>
<b>tEXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE
</b>
tCALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the
tgreat wedding celebration.  It is held in the Village
tSquare; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the
ttops of buildings, carrying luparas.

</b>
<b>tINT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA
</b>
tMICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight
tfills the room.

tHe turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA.  A
tlittle frightened; but lovely.

tHe moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,
tlooking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

tSlowly and tenderly he kisses her.  Her tiny hands come up
tto his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

tShe lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.

</b>
<b>tINT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA
</b>
tMorning.  MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the
troom.

tAPPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially
tcovered by the bedsheets.

tHe looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.

<b>tEXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD
</b>
<b>tHIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA
</b>
tWe HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving
terratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost
thitting th inner court wall.

tAPPOLONIA is laughing, driving.  MICHAEL pretends to be
tfrightened, as he teaches her to drive.

tOutside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking
tguard duty.

tThe car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt's safer to teach you English.

<b>ttttAPPOLONIA
</b>ttMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
ttThursday, Friday...See, I learned
ttit.  Now teach me to drive!

tDON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard.  He seems tired and
tconcerned.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttCiao, Don Tommassino.

tAPPOLONIA kisses him.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThings went badly in Palermo?

<b>ttttDON TOMMASSINO
</b>ttThe younger men have no respect.
ttThings are changing; I don't know
ttwhat will happen.  Michael, because
ttof the wedding, people now know
ttyour name.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIs that why there are more men on
ttthe walls?

<b>ttttDON TOMMASSINO
</b>ttEven so, I don't think it is safe
tthere anymore.  I've made plans to
ttmove you to a villa near Siracuse.
ttYou must go right away.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWhat is it?

<b>ttttDON TOMMASSINO
</b>ttBad news from America.  Your
ttbrother, Santino.  He has been
ttkilled.

tFor a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the
tFive Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

<b>tEXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD
</b>
tMorning.  MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.

tBelow, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,
tcombing his thick hair.

tMICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttGet the car.  I'll be leaving in
ttten minutes.  Where's Calo?

<b>ttttFABRIZZIO
</b>ttCalo is having a cup of coffee in
ttthe kitchen.  Is your wife coming
ttwith you?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo, she's going home to her family.
ttShe'll join me in a few weeks...

<b>tINT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN
</b>
tMICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the
tkitchen.  CALO is just finishing a bite.  He rises when he
tsees MICHAEL.

<b>ttttCALO
</b>ttShould I get your bag?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia?

<b>ttttCALO
</b>ttt  (smiling)
ttShe is sitting in the driver's seat
ttof the car, dying to step on the
ttgas.  She'll be a real American
ttwoman before she gets to America.

tMICHAEL smiles.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTell Fabrizzio and wait for me in
ttthe car.

tHe leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.

tHe looks out from the opening in the doorway.

<b>tEXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD
</b>
tThere is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's
tseat, playing with the wheel like a child.

tCALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear
tseat.

tThen MICHAEL seems disturbed.

tOver, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO
tdisappear through the gate.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (muttering to himself)
ttWhere the hell is he going?

tMICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.

tMICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer
tcourtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

tAPPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay
twhere he is.

<b>ttttAPPOLONIA
</b>ttt  (calling out)
ttI'll drive to you.

tHe smiles affectionately.

tCALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling
tby his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the
tsmile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds
tout his hand.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo.  No!

tHis shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,
tas she switched on the ignition.

tPart of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;
tand there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.

tMICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.

<b>tINT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM
</b>
tMICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.  We hear
twhispering around him, but can't make any of it out.  A soft
tcloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.  DON
tTOMMASSINO is there, close to him.  He looks at them and
tfrom their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttFabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know
ttthat the one who gives me Fabrizzio
ttwill own the finest pastures in
ttSicily.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)
</b>
tEaster.

tA HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes
tof little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children
tand Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,
tsearching here and there for candy treasures and hidden
tEaster eggs.

tThe DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing
tbaggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around
this garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

tSuddenly, he stops and looks.

tMICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

tGreat emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in
tMICHAEL's direction.

tMICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son
tand embraces him.

tDON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the
tbuilding.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttThis old building has seen its day.
ttNo way to do business...too small,

tThey enter the DON's glass-panelled office.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttHave you thought about a wife?  A

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (pained)
ttNo.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttI understand, Michael.  But you

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI want children, I want a family.
ttBut I don't know when.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttAccept what's happened, Michael.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI could accept everything that's
tthappened; I could accept it, but
ttthat I never had a choice.  From
ttthe time I was born, you had laid
ttthis all out for me.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttNo, I wanted other things for you.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYou wanted me to be your son.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttYes, but sons who would be
ttprofessors, scientists,
ttmusicians...and grandchildren who
ttcould be, who knows, a Governor, a
ttPresident even, nothing's impossible
tthere in America.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThen why have I become a man like
ttyou?

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttYou are like me, we refuse to be
ttfools, to be puppets dancing on a
ttstring pulled by other men.  I
tthoped the time for guns and killing
ttand massacres was over.  That was
ttmy misfortune.  That was your
ttmisfortune.  I was hunted on the
ttstreets of Corleone when I was

ttfather was.  I had no choice.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttA man has to choose what he will be.
ttI believe that.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWhat else do you believe in?

tMICHAEL doesn't answer.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttBelieve in a family.  Can you
ttbelieve in your country?  Those
ttPezzonovante of the State who
ttdecide what we shall do with our
ttlives?  Who declare wars they wish
ttus to fight in to protect what they
ttown.  Do you put your fate in the
tthands of men whose only talent is
ttthat they tricked a bloc of people
ttto vote for them?  Michael, in five
ttyears the Corleone family can be
ttcompletely legitimate.  Very
ttdifficult things have to happen to
ttmake that possible.  I can't do
ttthem anymore, but you can, if you
ttchoose to.

tMICHAEL listens.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttBelieve in a family; believe in a
ttCode of Honor, older and higher,
ttbelieve in Roots that go back
ttthousands of years into your Race.
ttMake a family, Michael, and protect

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttt  (hurrying into the bedroom)

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttJohnny, the Corleone family is

</b>ttI'll make him an offer he can't

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttJohnny, the Don wants you to help

tfollowed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed
tin the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast

</b>ttBuy me out?...

tttomorrow.  Think of your price.

<b>ttttMOE
</b>ttYou son of a bitch, you think you

ttfrom strength, not weakness.  We
ttshould build our Regimes and take

ttIsland, at least.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttDo you have faith in my judgement?

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttYes, Godfather...

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttThen do what Michael says...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttAll I can say is that things are
ttbeing resolved that are more
tteffective than a thousand buttonmen
tton the streets.  Understood?

tThere are uneasy looks all around.

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttUnderstood.  I just wish I was
ttdoing more to help out.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI'll come to you when I need you.

tHe looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.  They all nod,
treluctantly.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttAll right, then it's resolved.

tNERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.

tCLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,
tthen CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the
tcorridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.

tThen NERI closes the door.

tMICHAEL relaxes.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttMike, why are you cutting me out of
ttthe action?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTom, we're going to be legitimate
ttall the way, and you're the legal
ttman.  What could be more important
ttthan that.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI'm not talking about that.  I'm
tttalking about Rocco Lampone building
tta secret regime.  Why does Neri
ttreport directly to you, rather than
ttthrough me or a caporegime?

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttI told you that it wouldn't escape
tthis eye.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHow did you find out?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttBookkeepers know everything.
ttRocco's men are all a little too
ttgood for the jobs they're supposed
ttto be doing.  They get a little
ttmore money than the job's worth.
ttt  (pause)
ttLampone's a good man; he's operating
ttperfectly.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNot so perfectly if you noticed.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttMike, why am I out?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYou're not a wartime Consigliere.
ttThings may get tough with the move
ttwe're trying.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttOK, but then I agree with Tessio.
ttYou're going about it all wrong;
ttyou're making the move out of
ttweakness... Barzini's a wolf, and
ttif he tears you apart, the other
ttfamilies won't come running to help
ttthe Corleones...

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttTom, I never thought you were a bad
ttConsigliere, I thought Santino a
ttbad Don, rest in peace.  He had a
ttgood heart but he wasn't the right
ttman to head the family when I had
ttmy misfortune.  Michael has all my
ttconfidence, as you do.  For reasons
ttwhich you can't know, you must have
ttno part in what will happen.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttMaybe I can help.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (coldly)
ttYou're out, Tom.

tTOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM
tleaves.

tMICHAEL looks at NERI.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI'm going to talk to my father.

tNERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors,
tbreathes in the air, and steps outside.

<b>tEXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)
</b>
<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttI see you have your Luca Brasi.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI'll need him.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttThere are men in this world who
ttdemand to be killed.  They argue in
ttgambling games; they jump out of
tttheir cars in a rage if someone so
ttmuch as scratches their fender.
ttThese people wander through the
ttstreets calling out "Kill me, kill
ttme."  Luca Brasi was like that.
ttAnd since he wasn't scared of
ttdeath, and in fact, looked for
ttit...I made him my weapon.  Because
ttI was the only person in the world
ttthat he truly hoped would not kill
tthim.  I think you have done the
ttsame with this man.

tThey walk through the DON's vegetable garden.  Tomatoes,
tpeppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.
tMICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then
tstoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttBarzini will move against you first.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHow?

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttHe will get in touch with you
ttthrough someone you absolutely
tttrust.  That person will arrange a
ttmeeting, guarantee your safety...

tHe rises, and looks at Michael...

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>tt...and at that meeting you will be
ttassassinated.

tThe DON walks on further.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttYour wife and children...you're
tthappy with them?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttGood.

tMICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI've always respected you...

tA long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttAnd I...you.

<b>tEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)
</b>
tKAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left
tthem off.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHow is your husband feeling?

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttHe's not the same since they shot
tthim.  He lets Michael do all the
ttwork.  He just plays the fool with
tthis garden, his peppers, his
tttomatoes, as if he was some peasant
ttstill.  But men are like that...

tShe stops toward the Church.

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttYou come in, too.

tKAY shakes her head.

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttThe Priest ain't gonna bite you
ttcause you're not Catholic.
ttt  (whispered)
ttHe's in the back drinkin' his wine.

tKAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.
tThey enter.

<b>tINT DAY: CHURCH (1955)
</b>
tInside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from
tthe holy water.

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttYou can.

tTentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and
tblesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in
tawe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally
tthe Altar.

tMAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a
tlarge coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting
tcandles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives
ther some.

tMAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the
ttaper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great
tdignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights
ttwenty candles.

tShe finishes, and bows her head.

<b>tEXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME
</b>
tVery few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black
tflower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.
tAn expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.
tCertainly no more could be done for a President or a King.

tEach car carries an elaborate floral decoration.  We show
tthese in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to
tMankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."Our Don Our Leader"..."The
tSacred Heart"...

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (1955)
</b>
<b>tHIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL
</b>
tSilence.

tThe flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill
tall the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.

tHundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the
twedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is
tsomber and respectful.

tMICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform
twhich holds the ornate coffin.  We cannot see the remains of
tDon Corleone.

tBONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved
tfamily.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely
twith grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

tThe VIEW ALTERS,

tand we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears
topenly falling, takes his turn.

tChildren are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last
tlook at the great man.

tCLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE
timmediately arranges for the members of the Five New York
tFamilies to pay their respects.

tFirst CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP
tTATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.

tThen BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.

tMICHAEL watches the scene.

tBARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined
tby his men.

tAs BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on
thim; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear
tfrom the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that
the is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don
tCorleone.

tMICHAEL watches silently.

tBARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First
tCLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO.

tCONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He
tembraces and comforts her.

tEverywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching
tall who come close to him.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (LATER)
</b>
tLater on the Mall; some people have left, although there are
tstill hundreds of mourners.

tA young GIRL approaches TESSIO.  She's about 18.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttDo you remember me?

<b>ttttTESSIO
</b>ttNo...

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttWe danced together at Connie's
ttwedding.

tTESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',
tand they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.  He
tfinds him.

<b>ttttTESSIO
</b>ttMike, could I have a minute?

tMIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.  NERI is close
tby.

<b>ttttTESSIO
</b>ttBarzini wants to arrange a meeting.
ttSays we can straighten any of our
ttproblems out.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHe talked to you?

<b>ttttTESSIO
</b>ttt  (nods)
ttI can arrange security.

tMICHAEL looks at him.

<b>tEXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)
</b>
tThe Cemetery.  Late day.

tThe hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the
tstone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in
tQueens Village.

tHundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take
tpictures, etc.

tMICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (softly)
ttChrist, Tom; I needed more time
ttwith him.  I really needed him.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttDid he give you his politicians?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNot all...I needed another four
ttmonths and I would have had them
ttall.
ttt  (he looks at TOM)
ttI guess you've figured it all out?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttHow will they come at you?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI know now.
ttt  (a passion wells up
ttt  inside of MICHAEL)
ttI'll make them call me Don.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttHave you agreed on a meeting?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (nods)
ttA week from tonight.  In Brooklyn
tton Tessio's ground, where I'll be
ttsafe.

tHAGEN looks at him; understands.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttBut after the Baptism.  I've
ttdecided to stand as godfather to
ttConnie's baby.

tThey look up.

tThe coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which
tstands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,
twith the bold inscription: CORLEONE.

<b>tINT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)
</b>
tALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he
tpulls a small trunk from under his bed.  He opens it, and we
tsee in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's
tuniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.
tThen the badge, and the identification card; with his
tpicture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he
tbegins to dress.

<b>tINT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)
</b>
tMICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in
ttheir room.  MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is
tbeginning to take on a matronly look.

tchecks it, and puts it back together.

<b>tEXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)
</b>
tPETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.  He hesitates,
ttakes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then
tgets in, drives off.

<b>tEXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)
</b>
tThe Church.

tVarious relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the
tChurch.  They laugh and talk.  A MONSIGNOR is officiating.
tNot all of the participants have arrived yet.

tCONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.  She holds the
tinfant; showing him off to interested people.

<b>tEXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)
</b>
tNERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN

tpoliceman.  He carries a huge flashlight.

<b>tEXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)

tMotel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising

</b>ttYes, I promise.

<b>tEXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.
</b>
tNERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He
tcontinues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On
this side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly
tacross from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he
tapproaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his
tnightstick.

tThe DRIVER looks up in surprise.

tNERI points to the "No Parking" sign.

tThe DRIVER turns his head away.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttOK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or
ttyou wanna move?

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttt  (obviously a hood)
ttYou better check with your precinct.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttMove it!

tThe DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,
tand hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's
tjacket.

tNERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then
the crooks a finger at the DRIVER.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttLet me see you license and
ttregistration.

<b>tEXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY

tIt parks.  A young, pretty GIRL gets out.  Quickly, he
treturns into the room.

<b>tINT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)
</b>
tCLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.  He
trounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.

tapplies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.

<b>tWHAT HE SEES:
</b>
tTWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving
tglass doors.

tNERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass
tdoors.  The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of
tBARZINI within them.

tthe infant.

tLAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down
tthe iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.

tsemi-nude young GIRL leans up.

tThey are riddled with gunfire.

tThe christening party outside the Church.

tFour or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to
treceive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.

tEveryone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

tAs the fuss is going on, a car pulls up.  LAMPONE gets out
tand works his way to MICHAEL.  He whispers in his ear.  This
tis the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

tCONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttKiss your Godfather.

tThe infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an
texcuse to back away.

ttto go on ahead.

tTHREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt  (gently)
ttI can't go with you either, Tessio.

tHe flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he
tpanics, and then he accepts it.

<b>ttttTESSIO
</b>ttt  (after the pause)
ttTell Mike it was business...I

ttTom, can you get me off the hook?
ttFor old times' sake?

tHAGEN looks away, and walks off.

<b>tINT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

tnervously.  He moves to the window and looks out.

</b>
tMICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,
tLAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

tHe wears a broad smile.

<b>ttttCARLO
</b>ttGodfather!

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYou have to answer for Santino.

tThe smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish
tattempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and
tbacks into the living room.

<b>tINT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)
</b>
tThe door opens, and the grim party enters.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYou fingered Sonny for the Barzini

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (quietly)
ttBarzini is dead.  So is Philip
ttTattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
ttand Moe Greene...I want to square
ttall the family accounts tonight.
ttSo don't tell me you're innocent;
ttadmit what you did.

tCARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (almost kindly)
ttDon't be frightened.  Do you think
ttI'd make my sister a widow?  Do you
ttthink I'd make your children
ttfatherless?  After all, I'm

ttpunishment is that you're out of
ttthe family business.  I'm putting
ttyou on a plane to Vegas--and I want
ttyou to stay there.  I'll send
ttConnie an allowance, that's all.
ttBut don't keep saying you're

</b>ttt  (softly)
ttGood, good.  Leave now; there's a

tONE opens the front door for him.

tSOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.

tCARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back
tto see the other man.

tIt is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

tThe motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA
tsuddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes
tand leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.

tThe garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

tHis thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.

tThen the body goes slack.

tCLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car
tdrives off.

</b>ttYou know I would never question
ttanything you say.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (smiles)
ttSpeak your mind.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttI'll do this for you; you know I
ttshould.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo.  This I have to do.

<b>tEXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)
</b>
tMICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an
tItalian Pizzeria.  NERI opens the door.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttSit in the car.

<b>tINT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)
</b>
tHe walks alone into the restaurant.  A MAN is tossing pizza
tdough in the air.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWhere's the boss?

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttIn the back.  Hey Frank, someone
ttwants you.

tA MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttWhat is it?

tHe stops, frozen in fear.  It is FABRIZZIO.

tVIEW ON MICHAEL.  Gunfire from under his coat.  FABRIZZIO is
tcut down.  MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.

<b>tEXT DAY: MALL (1955)
</b>
<b>tHIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL
</b>
tSeveral moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that
tthese are the final days; the families are moving out; signs
tindicating that the property is for sale are evident.

tA black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,
tthe rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,
trestrained by MAMA.  She manages to break free and runs
tacross the Mall into Michael's house.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)
</b>
tInside the Corleone house.  Big boxes have been packed;
tfurniture prepared for shipping.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttMichael!

tShe hurries into the living room, where she comes upon
tMICHAEL and KAY.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt  (comforting)
ttConnie...

tBut CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.  NERI
tis watchful.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttYou lousy bastard; you killed my
tthusband...

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttConnie...

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttYou waited until our father died
ttand nobody could stop you and you
ttkilled him, you killed him!  You
ttblamed him about Sonny, you always
ttdid, everybody did.  But you never
ttthought about me, never gave a damn
ttabout me.
ttt  (crying)
ttWhat am I going to do now, what am
ttI going to do.

tTWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders
tfrom him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to
tfinish.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttConnie, how could you say such
ttthings?

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttWhy do you think he kept Carlo on
ttthe Mall?  All the time he knew he
ttwas going to kill my husband.  But
tthe didn't dare while my father was
ttalive.  And then he stood Godfather
ttto our child.  That coldhearted
ttbastard.
ttt  (to KAY)
ttAnd do you know how many men he had
ttkilled with Carlo?  Just read the
ttpapers.  That's your husband.

tShe tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria
tshe has no saliva.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttGet her home and get a doctor.

tThe TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,
tgently but firmly.

tKAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from
tMICHAEL.  He feels her look.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttShe's hysterical.

tBut KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMichael, it's not true.  Please
tttell me.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttDon't ask me.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttTell me!

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttAll right, this one time I'll let
ttyou ask about my affairs, one last
tttime.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttIs it true?

tShe looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so
tdirectly that we know he will tell the truth.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt  (after a very long pause)
ttNo.

tKAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs
thim.  Then she kisses him.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt  (through her tears)
ttWe both need a drink.

<b>tINT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)
</b>
tShe moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the
tdrinks.  From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the
tdrinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the
thouse with their BODYGUARDS.

tShe watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive
tthem.  He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one
tfoot slightly behind the other.  One hand on his hip, like a
tRoman Emperor.  The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

tCLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttDon Corleone...

tThe smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her
thusband has become.

<b>tINT DAY: CHURCH (1955)
</b>
tKAY wears a shawl over her hand.  She drops many coins in
tthe coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in
ta pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.
