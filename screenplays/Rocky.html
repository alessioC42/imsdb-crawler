<b>RING PRODUCTIONS, INC.
</b>
<b>MASTER SCRIPT: INCLUDES ALL REVISIONS AS OF 1/7/76  REVISED:
</b><b> 
</b>



<b>INT. BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
<b>SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... "NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA"
</b>
... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can.
The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle.
The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is
fighting.

In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black.
The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old.
His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black
hair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a
plodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and
bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy.
But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins
at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead.

The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for
blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters.
In the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is
hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony.
A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.

The BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner...
Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring.

The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers
across the ring at Rocky.

<b>ttttBLACK FIGHTER
</b>ttt(to cornerman)
tt... I'm gonna bust his head
ttwide open!

In Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled,
balding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He
works on Rocky without any enthusiasm.

<b>ttttCORNERMAN
</b>ttt(lackluster)
tt... Ya waltzin' -- Give the
ttsuckers some action.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHey --

<b>ttttCORNERMAN
</b>ttt(overriding)
ttYa movin' like a bum -- Want
ttsome advice --

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Just gimme the water.
<b> 
</b>
<b>tttttttttt2.
</b>

A FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with
yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.

<b>ttttFAN
</b>ttShould I bet the fight don't
ttgo the distance -- Ya feel
ttstrong?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttAbsolutely.

<b>ttttCORNERMAN
</b>tt... Ya want some good advice?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... I just want the mouthpiece.

The BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross.  The
fighters engage in battle.  The other fighter grabs Rocky in
a clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding
cut on the corner of Rocky's eye.

Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into
the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the
fighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into
the ring.  Rocky ignores it.

The fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does
not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under
the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new
fighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe.
Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion."

<b>ttttANNOUNCER
</b>ttWinner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a
ttsix rounder between local
ttlightweights.

Without pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a
cigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher
passes behind him.  He watches for a moment and continues up
the aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the
BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky
fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.

<b>THE TITLE CREDITS END:
</b>
<b>INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his
locker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other
fighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.
<b> 
</b>
<b>tttttttttt3.
</b>

<b>ttttFIGHTER #1
</b>tt... Tomorrow me an' my woman
ttare gonna tip on down to
ttAtlantic City, man.

<b>ttttFIGHTER #2
</b>tt... It's cold, Bro'.

<b>ttttFIGHTER #1
</b>tt... That's right, I got the
ttcity to myself...

Another paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and
spit nervously on the floor.

A young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO
that is BLASTING MUSIC.

The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer
and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters
are smoking.  The room is cloudy.

A short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater
buttoned over a t-shirt.

<b>ttttPROMOTER
</b>tt...Balboa!?

Rocky raises his head.  The promoter steps over.

<b>ttttPROMOTER
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt... Twenty bucks for the
ttlocker an' cornerman -- Two
ttbucks for the towel an'
ttshower, seven for tax -- The
tthouse owes ya, sixty-one
ttdollars.

The man peels off the money and departs... Rocky closes his
locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.

<b>INT. TROLLEY - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly... The
trolley is empty except for a thin old black WOMAN... The
black Woman studies Rocky's bruised face... Rocky becomes
self-conscious.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(almost apologetic)
ttI'm a fighter.
<b> 
</b>
<b>tttttttttt4.
</b>

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(tired)
tt... Yo' iz an accident.

<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... He waves
at a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back.

Rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty
bookstore.  Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway.

Further down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the
"ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP"... He peers into the dark store and
sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window.  He mumbles to
the dog and continues to the corner.

<b>EXT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
A short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located
in the most deprived section of South Philly.  He kicks away
the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and
enters.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
The narrow hallway is painted olive brown.  A single light
bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky enters.  The one-room apartment is drab, with a
curling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall...
Nailed against the far wall is a mattress.  The mattress is
used as a punching bag.  Stuffing spills out of the center.

Rocky drops his coat on the floor.  He puts on a pair of
glasses.  He crosses to a small turtle bowl... He lifts the
creatures.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt...Look who's home.

Rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then
places an old 45 RPM record on a battered phonograph.  The
record is a tune, "ALL IN THE GAME."

... As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his
hairbrush.  Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the
record.  He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning
to thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a
bullish fighting stance and throws several punches.

The water boils.  Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.
<b> 
</b>
<b>tttttttttt5.
</b>

<b>EXT. SUNRISE OF PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAWN
</b>
We SEE the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering
figure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it
sits majestically above City Hall...

<b>EXT. DOCKS - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Rocky is walking along the waterfront... He has a bandaid
over one eye.  He looks at the rugged stevedores going about
their business... He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool
jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded.

Rocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked
car.  These men look like blood drinkers.

<b>ttttMAFIA #1
</b>ttYo, Rock -- How's your Boss?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttReal good.

<b>ttttMAFIA #2
</b>ttFightin' again?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah, here an' there.

<b>ttttMAFIA #1
</b>ttMebbe we make sum money
tttogather soon... Give ya boss
ttmy best.

Rocky shrugs and moves away... He nears a heavy man working
the crane.  The heavy man looks frightened... He stops the
crane and hurries into the ship's hole.  Rocky dashes up the
gangplank.

<b>INT. SHIP - DAY
</b>
The man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked
crates and coffee beans.

Rocky sprints after him... He lunges and flings the man by
the neck against the wall of stacked cargo.

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttt(terror-filled)
ttDon't hit the face!  Not the
ttface!!

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttMr. Gazzo wants the two
tthundred now!
<b> 
</b>
<b>tttttttttt6.
</b>

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttHonest to God I'm broke --
ttGimme a break.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttMr. Gazzo says I should get
tttwo hundred or break the thumb.

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttPlease, I need my hands to
ttwork -- Christ, don't bust my
ttthumbs.

At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by
stevedores.  Rocky remains cool.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttGoin' fishin'?

The man drops the hook.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWhat's ya name again?

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttBob.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttLook, Bob, if ya wanna dance,
ttya gotta pay the band -- If ya
ttborrow, ya gotta pay the man...
ttMe, I ain't emotionally
ttinvolved.

Rocky's determined expression strikes home.  The fat man
quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small
wad of bills.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing; counting)
ttA hundred an' thirty.

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttThat's it, I'm broke.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttThat's it? -- Completely?

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttThat's it.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWhat about for food an' stuff?
<b> 
</b>
<b>tttttttttt7.
</b>

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttYou have my food in ya hand.

Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's
flushed expression.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... The juice is climbin'
ttevery week.

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttI know the juice is climbin' --
ttI been workin' six months just
ttto pay the damn interest.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYa still light seventy.

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttWaits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't
tthave to break nothin' -- Here,
tttake my coat, it's worth
ttfifty-sixty dollars.  It's
ttyours.

The man quickly removes his coat and extends it...

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSee, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's
ttdon't have to know nuthin'.
ttI'll go tape up the hand like
ttya broke my thumb.  Gazzo
ttwon't be wise to nothin' -- Be
tta smart guy, keep the coat,
ttwe'll fake like ya broke the
tthand.

The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the
man's thumb and bends him to his knees.

<b>ttttFATS
</b>ttt(almost a whisper)
ttNo - no - no - Please -
ttPlease - Please don't...

Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock.  The
thumb is fine.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt...That's what coulda happened.
ttt(walks off.)
<b> 
</b>
<b>tttttttttt8.
</b>

<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
Later that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in
South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In
the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed
Kittens -- $1.50"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning.
He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the
window and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and
presses his face against the window and does his impression
of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks
away.

The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not
very attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old.
Brown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses.

Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so
painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters.

<b>INT. PET SHOP - DAY
</b>
<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt... Could you take the puppy
ttout --

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttIt can breathe.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttPlease -

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttPlease, nothin' - I paid for
ttthis dog and can do whatever I
ttwant with it - I can throw it
ttthrough the window if I want -
ttNow give me my two dollars
ttback before I do throw it
ttthrough the window.

Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches
the bag out of her hand.  He removes the puppy and hands it
to Adrian.

<b>ttttCUSTOMER
</b>ttGet away from me - Give me that!

Rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it
to the lady... She nervously exits.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... How's the turtle food this
ttweek?
<b> 
</b>
<b>tttttttttt9.
</b>

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt... Fine.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttMe, I'm kinda aggravated.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt... I'm sorry.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttAin't your fault - Here's the
ttproblem.

Adrian nods... Though charmed, she is slightly intimidated.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttThe last food I got here had
ttmore moths than flies -- An'
ttthe moths get caught in my
ttturtle's throat -- That makes
ttthem cough --

The OWNER, a squat woman of forty, steps out of the back and
waves at Rocky.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYo, Gloria -- I was talkin'
ttabout the turtle food -- Like
ttI was sayin', the moths get
ttcaught in the turtle's throat
ttan' makes 'em cough...
ttt(coughs)
ttA little cough an' I gotta
ttsmack 'em on the shell -- An'
ttwhatta think they get?

Adrian shrugs.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI smack 'em hard on the shell
ttan' they get... What?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt... I don't know.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttShell-shocked!

Both the Owner and Adrian smile.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt10.
</b>

<b>ttttOWNER
</b>ttStartin' with the bad jokes
ttearly today, huh.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttInventin' jokes ain't easy.

Rocky steps over to a large cage at the rear of the shop...
Inside is a huge dog.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHow's Butkus this mornin'?

<b>ttttOWNER
</b>ttAin't had time to check 'em.

Rocky opens the cage and the large dog jumps out and looks
very happy.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYo, Butkus -- Dead.  Play dead.

The dog plays dead.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt...What kinda dog is this again?

<b>ttttOWNER
</b>ttBullmastiff.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttThe owner was suppose to pick
tthim up three weeks ago.

<b>ttttOWNER
</b>ttWe're not responsible for
ttanimals left over thirty
ttdays - We board it ain't a
ttanimal shelter, Y'know.
tt...Adrian, I want you to clean
ttall those cat cages downstairs,
ttthey're a mess.
ttt(Adrian nods.)


Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop.

<b>EXT. LEHIGH ST. TRAIN TRESTLE - DAY
</b>
Gazzo picks up Rocky.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt11.
</b>

<b>INT. GAZZO'S CAR - MOVING - DAY
</b>
MR. GAZZO and his YOUNG BODY GUARD sit in the front seat...
Rocky is in the back seat.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHe only had a hundred an'
ttthirty. -- I think he's good
ttfor the rest next week, Mr.
ttGazzo.

<b>ttttGAZZO
</b>ttt(patiently)
ttSure, Rocky, Bob's good for
ttit...

Gazzo hands Rocky a twenty.

<b>ttttGAZZO
</b>ttTomorrow collect from Del
ttRio -- He's late three weeks.
ttHow'd you do last night?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Fine.

Gazzo's Bodyguard looks at Rocky's bruised face in the
mirror and smiles.

<b>ttttBODYGUARD
</b>ttDid ya get the license number?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttOf wa?

<b>ttttBODYGUARD
</b>tt... Of the truck that run over
ttyour face.

Gazzo steps out of the car and beckons to Rocky.

<b>ttttGAZZO
</b>ttYo Rock.  Did I give you a job
ttthis mornin?  How come ya
ttdidn't break this guy's thumb
ttlike I asked ya?  When ya
ttdon't do what ya are told, it
ttmakes me look bad, kid.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI figure if I break the thumb
ttthis guy gets thrown outta his
ttjob and can't pay nothin no
ttmore.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt12.
</b>

<b>ttttGAZZO
</b>ttIt don't matter.  It's my
ttreputation.  These guys think
ttthey can get off light.  It's
ttbad for my reputation -- It's
ttbad for business.  See ya
ttkiller.

Gazzo gets into his car.

<b>ttttGAZZO
</b>ttt(to Bodyguard)
tt... The Rock's a good kid.

<b>ttttBODYGUARD
</b>ttt(emotionless)
tt... A meatbag.

They pull away.

<b>EXT. GYM - DAY
</b>
Gazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to
Goldmill's Gym.  On the way he passes several familiar
people and exchanges waves... Out front is a young Irishman
who runs a soft pretzel stand... His name is RUDY.  It is
apparent from his face he was a prize fighter... He is blind
and mentally defective.

<b>ttttRUDY
</b>tt...See the fight last night?

<b>ttttRUDY
</b>ttNah, I was fightin' myself.

<b>ttttRUDY
</b>ttApollo Creed beat the bum to
ttpieces.

<b>EXT./INT. GYM - DAY
</b>
Mickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy
spoons.  Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive
among themselves.  Two winos lean against the entrance.

Rocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full.  The
MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes
the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of
machinery.  Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers
BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of
the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the
THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt13.
</b>

The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five
percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other.

As Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to
wave and yell greetings.

<b>ttttFIGHTER #1
</b>ttHey, hear ya knocked Spider
ttRice out in the sixth?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttThe third -- Shoulda seen it.

Rocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag.

<b>ttttFIGHTER #2
</b>ttt(removes glove)
ttHey, Rock, touch my hand.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHow come?

<b>ttttFIGHTER #2
</b>ttC'mon, it's important.

Rocky touches the Fighter's bare hand.

<b>ttttFIGHTER #2
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttCan ya tell I just whacked-off?

Rocky smiles and moves away.

<b>INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
</b>
The dressing room is lined with dented lockers.  Wooden
benches stretch across the room.  On the wall is a sign that
reads, "NO KISSING."

Rocky goes to his locker.  He tries to open it but fails.
He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers.
Still it does not open.  He shakes the lock forcefully, no
luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the
situation.

After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the
bench and smashes open the lock.  Opening the door Rocky is
taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(mumbling)
tt... These ain't my clothes.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt14.
</b>

He sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside
of the door.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt... These ain't my pictures.

A short powerful man of thirty-five enters.  His hair looks
like it has been shaped with hedge clippers.  His name is
<b>MIKE.
</b>
<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYo, Mike -- What's happenin'
tthere?

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttIt ain't your locker no more.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWhatta ya talkin' about it
ttain't my locker no more?

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttListen, I'm with you -- But ya
ttgotta talk to Mickey -- I put
ttya stuff in the bag over there.

Rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping
bag and follows Mike across the room... Mike leans his head
into the shower room.  Two Latin fighters are lathering up.

<b>ttttFIGHTER
</b>tt...Hey, Peanut, gimme some
ttsoap, Man.

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttt(irate)
ttHey, Nobody -- Yeah, you,
ttNobody -- You don't call me
ttPeanut.

<b>ttttFIGHTER
</b>ttPeanut, gimme some soap.

The fighters laugh.  Inflamed, Mike removes a bar of soap
from his pocket and hurls it at the insulting fighter.  It
hits just above the man's head.  The fighters are shocked
into silence.

Mike turns and exits with Rocky... The fighters curse them
loudly in Spanish.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt15.
</b>

<b>INT. GYM - DAY
</b>
Rocky and Mike move past fighters going through their
training routines.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYou were ready to bite that
ttguy's face.

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttYeah -- See the fight last
ttnight?  Apollo Creed beat that
ttEnglish guy bad.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttCreed's great.

Mike fakes a friendly punch at Rocky and hurries off to
another chore...

<b>INT. GYM - DAY
</b>
The Owner, MICKEY, sits on a stool near the entrance.  He
wears a baggy suit... He is in his late seventies.

Rocky approaches... Mickey is conversing with another fighter.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttI don't care what nobody says,
ttthis bum Creed woulda never
ttmade it in the Thirties --

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHey, how ya feelin', Mickey?

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(monotoned)
tt... What?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI said, how ya feelin'?

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(dryly)
ttDo you see me talkin'?  Huh?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(low)
ttYeah.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt16.
</b>

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(spitting)
ttThen stand there an' wait till
ttI'm done -- Creed's good,
ttyeah, he's real fine but I
ttgotta boy, y'know Big Dipper,
ttwho's got the stuff it takes
ttto be a champ -- He's mean,
ttquick, an' big -- What more
ttd'ya need?  Okay, go to work...
ttt(to Rocky)
ttHey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI was talkin' with ya man,
ttMike. -- Hey, how come I been
ttput outta my locker?

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttDipper needed it.

Rocky turns and looks at DIPPER sparring... Dipper is a
young, muscular heavyweight with a mean expression.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttDipper's a climber -- You're a
tttomato.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Tomato?

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttFacts is facts.  I run a
ttbusiness here -- I'm cleanin'
tthouse --

Mickey pauses to watch a young middleweight time-skip as his
trainer sings "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM."

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHow old are ya?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt...What?

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttHow old?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttCome July, twenty-five.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt17.
</b>

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttMore like thirty.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttTwenty-five, thirty -- What's
ttthe difference? -- It took me
tttwo months to learn the
ttcombination of that locker.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttThe legs must be goin'.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah, they're goin', -- that's
ttnature... That was my locker
ttfor six years.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>tt... Did ya fight last night?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah --

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttDid ya win?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah, Kayo.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>tt... Who'd ya fight?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttSpider Rice.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttRice is a bum.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYou think everybody I fight is
tta bum.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttAin't they?

Mickey shoots Rocky a quick, indifferent look and removes a
rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt18.
</b>

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYa want the truth -- Ya got
ttheart, but ya fight like an
ttape -- The only thing special
ttabout you is ya never got ya
ttnose broke -- keep ya nose
ttpretty -- what's left of ya
ttbrain an' retire.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttListen, I'm gonna take a
ttsteam -- Did good last night --
ttShoulda seen it.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttHey, ever think about retirin'?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt...No.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttThink about it.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah, sure.

Shrugging, Rocky moves away.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt...I think I'm gonna take a
ttsteam -- Shoulda seen me
ttfight -- Did good, y'know.

Mickey leans over to Mike who approaches with a mop and pail.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(gesturing
ttttowards Rocky)
ttKnown him since he was
ttfifteen -- A waste of life.

Dejected, Rocky travels to the locker room.  He passes Big
Dipper sparring in a ring... Dipper spits a mouthful of
water in a bucket and looks smugly at Rocky.

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttt(to Rocky)
tt... I dig yo' locker, Man.

<b>ttttTRAINER
</b>ttTime, Dipper.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt19.
</b>

Dipper smiles cruelly and begins sparring... Scene FADES on
Rocky's crestfallen expression.  He moves off.

<b>EXT. PET SHOP - DUSK
</b>
At sunset Rocky comes down the street and pauses at the pet
shop... He is eating Colonel Sanders' fried chicken out of a
bag... He taps on the window with a chicken bone.

<b>INT. PET SHOP - DUSK
</b>
Inside Adrian is arranging pet toys on the counter... She
hears the tapping, sees Rocky, and tenses.  Rocky enters.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Wow -- cold!  Good night
ttto catch pneumonia.

Adrian smiles slightly and moves behind the counter.  Rocky
fumbles idly among the pet toys.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAh -- I came in here for
ttsomethin'... Oh, yeah, would
ttya like somebody to walk ya
tthome?

The girl wants to say yes but a tremendous inferiority
complex will not permit it... Rocky understands.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey, how's my buddy doin'?
ttt(looks into
tttButkus' cage)
tt-- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see
ttya later.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt... Goodnight, Rocky.

Rocky exits.  Adrian watches his departure with mixed
emotions.

<b>EXT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT
</b>
A short while later Rocky arrives at Andy's Bar... He throws
the Colonel Sanders bag and bones in a large public litter
can.  The trash can has a bicentennial picture of George
Washington pointing at a pile of garbage.  The caption
reads, "There was no litter at Valley Forge!"
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt20.
</b>

<b>INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky enters the bar.  He sits the Drunk in a booth...
Several drinkers wave at him.  OLD ANDY sets a mug of beer
in front of him... Rocky seems to be looking for someone.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttCatch pneumonia out there --
ttSeen Paulie?

Andy casually nods towards the men's room.

Rocky traverses the room and passes TWO DRUNKS leaning on
the bar.

<b>INT. ANDY'S RESTROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky enters the restroom... It is a vile stench hole with
years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall.

PAULIE is presently trying to comb his hair in the only
remaining piece of mirror in the room... Paulie is in his
early thirties.  He is medium height.  Brown hair.  Square
shouldered.  He has a foul personality... A classic
misanthrope.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYo, Paulie.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(very drunk)
ttYo, Rocky -- Look at this
ttmirror.  I'd like to kill the
ttfriggin' moron who broke this
ttmirror.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYo, Paulie.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYour sister's givin' me the
ttshoulder.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttForget her.  You could do
ttbetter than my sister.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttEvery mornin', every night I
ttpass by -- I smile.
<b>tttt(MORE)
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt21.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttI say jokes.  Nothin'.  She
ttlooks at me.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(annoyed)
ttLooks, huh?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah, like I was a plate of
ttleftovers -- Somethin' wrong
ttwith my face -- Whatta I need,
tta Caddy to connect with ya
ttsister?

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttMy sister's a friggin' loser.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHey --

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttSometimes she gets me so
ttcrazy, I'd like to split her
tthead with a razor.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttDon't get mental, man.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttYa caught me in a bad mood.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYa always in a bad mood --

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>tt... Adrian ain't sharp.

The restroom stench is overwhelming... Rocky covers his nose
with the neckline of his t-shirt.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttShe's a loser -- She don't
ttenjoy life -- She reads --
ttBrainy -- Pushin' thirty
ttfriggin' years old!  She's
ttgonna die alone if she don't
ttwise up.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI'm thirty myself.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt22.
</b>

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttAn' you're dyin' alone, too.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI don't see no crowd around
ttyou, neither.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(pointing at
tttthe wall)
ttI wanna kill the friggin'
ttmoron who broke the mirror.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttLet's get outta this stink.

<b>INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT
</b>
The restroom door opens.  Rocky guides Paulie out.  Though
stumbling, Paulie talks as he walks.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttThe girl's dryin' up!  She's
ttgotta live a little before her
ttbody dries up!!  You're a pal,
ttRock -- How 'bout yo' talk to
tther?  Y'know, it's Thanksgivin'
tttomorrow.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Sure.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttTomorrow you come for some
ttbird, right?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttAbsolutely...

Paulie smiles and Rocky guides him to a booth... Rocky steps
to the bar.  Andy leans over to him.

<b>ttttANDY
</b>ttThat was alotta crap to go
ttthrough for a dinner invite.

Rocky shakes his head no and raises his eyes towards a
suspended television... the nightly sports broadcast is on.
The SPORTS COMMENTATOR is at the airport and about to
interview the heavyweight champion of the world, APOLLO
CREED.  Creed is twenty-eight years old.  He is a tall,
smooth-muscled Black with barely a scar on his light coffee-
colored face...
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt23.
</b>

He is followed by an entourage of mixed trainers and
cornermen.  Also tagging alone is a small group of hangers-on.

The Commentator interviews Creed as he and his followers
disembark a private jet.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>ttHow was the flight, Champ?

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttVery high an' very fast.

Apollo's crowd smiles almost automatically at everything he
says.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>ttApollo, how would you rate
ttthis last British challenger,
ttHenry Wilcoxson?

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttHe was big, an' very nasty so
ttI destroyed him in a hurry --
ttNow I'm gettin' ready for Mac
ttLee Green next month.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>ttYou're referring to the much
ttpublicized bicentennial fight?

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttThat's right -- It's gonna be
ttthe greatest sportin' event in
ttthis country's history -- A
ttgala occurrence!

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>ttStill to be held in
ttPhiladelphia?

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttThe Bicentennial Heavyweight
ttChampionship of the World is
ttgonna be held in the only
ttplace it can be held --
ttPhiladelphia! -- the nation's
ttcradle -- January First -- the
ttfirst major event of our two
tthundredth year.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>ttWhere're you off to now?

Apollo draws his wife close.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt24.
</b>

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttMe an' my wife are goin' home
tt'cause we miss our children
ttan' can't go no more time
ttwithout seein' them.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>ttAny quick advice for young
ttboxing hopefuls?

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttt(looks straight
tttinto the camera)
tt... Stay in school an' use
ttyour brains, dig -- Be a
ttlawyer, be a doctor, carry a
ttleather briefcase an' forget
ttabout sports!!  Sports can
ttonly make ya grunt an' smell --
ttBe a thinker not a stinker!!

Apollo's entourage laughs and they move on... The Commentator
faces the camera.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>ttJerry Simpson at Kennedy
ttAirport with the Champion,
ttApollo Creed.

The sports show cuts away, but Rocky continues to look at
the television with a pensive stare... Andy has been speaking
the following dialogue over Apollo's broadcast.

<b>ttttANDY
</b>ttNobody cares what's happenin'
ttin the world of sports
ttnomore -- Downhill.  Baseball,
ttdownhill -- Basketball,
ttdownhill.  Football's goin',
tttoo.  Bank on it.  Baseball
ttuse to be America's best
ttsport... Sure -- Nuttin' like
ttsquattin' through a great
ttdouble header, but now
ttbaseball's all business.

The news report with Apollo ends.  Andy drinks.

<b>ttttANDY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhere are the real fighters?
ttThe pros.  Today we jig clowns.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt25.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttClown.

<b>ttttANDY
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHe took his best shot an'
ttbecame champ -- What shot did
ttyou ever take?

<b>ttttANDY
</b>ttYo, Rock, you ain't happy with
ttyourself?  Fine.  But me, I
ttgotta business here -- I don't
ttneed to take no shot.

Becoming despondent, Rocky rises and crosses to Paulie
slumped unconscious in the booth.

Rocky exits the bar... Andy turns to his customers.

<b>ttttANDY
</b>ttt(continuing; boldly)
ttTake a shot, he says! -- Sure,
ttI'll take a shot!

Laughing, Andy pours himself a shot.

<b>EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky passes an all-night sandwich shop... In the window
hangs the sign "ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP, INC." Out front are
several YOUNG MEN and WOMEN.  They are much too young to be
out so late... A boy with a badly-chipped tooth beckons to
Rocky.

<b>ttttCHIPPED TOOTH
</b>ttt(aggressively)
ttYo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... No wine -- Bad for ya'
ttbrain.

<b>ttttCHIPPED TOOTH
</b>ttC'mon, man, it's cold, man.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttNo wine.

<b>ttttCHIPPED TOOTH
</b>ttYo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt26.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttCHIPPED TOOTH
</b>ttt(sarcastically)
tt'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme
tta dollar.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttNo dollar.

<b>ttttCHIPPED TOOTH
</b>ttHey, give Rocky a dime.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN #2
</b>tt... How come?

<b>ttttCHIPPED TOOTH
</b>ttSo he can call all his friends.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(mildly embarrassed)
tt... That's an old one.

<b>ttttCHIPPED TOOTH
</b>ttBuy us some Thunderbird, man.

Rocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who
is smoking and leaning whore-like against the wall.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttIs that Marie? -- Marie, ya
ttbrother know you're hangin'
ttout so late?

The girl, MARIE, assumes an indifferent attitude, attempting
to impress her friends.

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>tt... Screw you.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(awed)
ttWhat'd you say?

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>tt... Screw you, yoyo.

The gang laughs.  Angered and shocked, Rocky grabs her arm.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttDid these guys teach you to
tttalk dirty?  Huh?
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt27.
</b>

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttHey --

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttStuff it, man!

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(shakes her)
ttDon't you never say that --
ttt(to the gang)
tt-- You guys talk like that in
ttfront of a little girl -- You
ttguys are scum.

<b>ttttCHIPPED TOOTH
</b>ttThis is our place, dig!

The gang reluctantly backs up a step.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttDon't ya never come round this
ttgirl -- Go home.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN #2
</b>ttThis is our corner, man!  You
ttgo, chump!

Rocky moves forward and they scatter... They quickly move off.

<b>ttttCHIPPED TOOTH
</b>ttt(backpedaling)
ttWe'll kill you, man -- We
ttgotta gun.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttPull heat on me? -- I'll dent
ttya face!

Rocky leads the girl away.

<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky is walking the young girl home... They are presently
cutting through a dark public school yard.  They pass
through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights
located at the top of the school building.  The atmosphere
is somewhat eerie.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt28.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHow come ya wanna hang out
ttwith those guys?  They teach
ttya bad things.

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttI like 'em.  If you don't you
ttcan f--

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHey!  When I was your age,
ttthere was only one girl who
tttalked like that in the whole
ttneighborhood.

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttt(bored)
tt... Yeah.

She attempts to light a cigarette... Rocky nonchalantly
tosses it to the ground.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttMake your teeth yella --

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttI like yella teeth.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttMakes your breath like garbage.

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttMaybe I like garbage.

Rocky and Marie take a shortcut through a dark school yard.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttNobody likes garbage --
ttAnyway, this girl with the
ttdirty mouth wasn't bad lookin',
ttbut the guys wouldn't take her
ttout for any serious datin'.

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt'Cause that's the way guys
ttare -- They laugh when ya talk
ttdirty.  They think ya cute for
tta while, but then ya getta
ttreputation an' watch out.
<b>tttt(MORE)
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt29.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttNobody's ever gonna take ya
ttserious.  Ya get no respect...
ttI gotta use a bad word --
ttWhore.  You'll end up maybe
ttbecomin' a whore.

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttC'mon, Rocky.  I'm twelve.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttThat doesn't matter -- You
ttdon't really have to be a
ttwhore, just act like one an'
ttthat's it.

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYo, a bad reputation -- Twenty
ttyears from now people will say
tt'D'you remember Marie?' 'No,
ttwho was she?' 'She was that
ttlittle whore who hung out at
ttthe Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh,
ttnow I remember!'... See, they
ttdon't remember you, they
ttremember the rep.

Rocky and Marie exit the dark school yard... Standing in the
shadows of the building are three young muggers.  The light
from their cigarettes flares red in their faces.

The muggers pace Rocky across the street and follow them
down the block... Rocky sees them and stops and faces the
three.  The muggers pause and study Rocky from a distance of
twenty yards.  Rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his
nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders...
The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander
away.

Rocky turns to Marie who has been standing behind him.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(points down
tttthe block)
tt... That's your house, ain't it?

Marie nods.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttListen, I hope ya don't --
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt30.
</b>

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttI won't.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWhat was I gonna say?

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttYa hope I don't keep acting
ttlike a whore or I'll turn into
ttone, right?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYa, somethin' like that.

They exchange smiles and Marie moves away.  Rocky has made
an impact on her life.

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>ttGoodnight, Rocky.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt'Night, Marie.

She takes a few more steps and pauses again.

<b>ttttMARIE
</b>tt... Fuck you, Creepo!!!

The girl runs to her house as Rocky looks on in dismay.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(walks off)
tt... Yeah, who're you to give
ttadvice, Creepo.

<b>INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY
</b>
APOLLO CREED and his LAWYER and TRAINER are seated in the
offices of MILES JERGENS.  Jergens, a successful promoter
looks unhappy as he looks into the scowling face of Apollo
Creed.

<b>ttttLAWYER
</b>ttAre the doctor's reports
ttconfirmed?

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttDefinitely --

<b>ttttLAWYER
</b>ttJergens, don't play games with

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttt(holding up

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttWent to California and gained

Apollo stands beneath a new fight poster and points to it.

ttPerhaps you're right, and no

</b>

<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
Late that afternoon Mr. Gazzo's white 1970 Cadillac pulls up
to Rocky's apartment... Rocky is in the back seat with the
loan shark.  Gazzo's bodyguard is driving.

Gazzo flips through a small black notepad.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttNext Wednesday I grab a grand

The Bodyguard reddens... Gazzo motions to his Bodyguard to
relax.

The Bodyguard has been looking at Rocky with murderous eyes.

</b>ttDon't like yours neither.

<b>ttttBODYGUARD
</b>ttKiss my ass.

Mr. Gazzo is amused.  He steps out of the car, followed by
Rocky.

<b>ttttGAZZO

ttBuddy's got a thing against

<b>EXT. STREET - DUSK

Rocky and Paulie walk towards his house... Even though it is
cold and dark, a group of kids conduct an energetic game of
half-ball. (Half-ball is a variation of stick-ball.)

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(mimes throwing)
ttI usta be deadly at half-ball.

Paulie extends his thick hands and tries to make a fist.

ttInflamed joints -- Walkin' in

<b>EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - DUSK
</b>
They continue past the Atomic Hoagie Shoppe, Inc... A group
of young men pitch quarters on the sidewalk out front.

Rocky pauses... He sees Marie, the little girl from the
night before, hanging around with the guys.  She sees Rocky.

Marie takes a deep drag on her cigarette and faces the
opposite direction... The gang smiles and continues to pitch
quarters.

Anger and disappointment register across Rocky's face.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttYou know her?

Rocky shrugs and the two men move off... Filling the night
air is the METALLIC SOUND of pitching QUARTERS.

<b>EXT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The men arrive at Paulie's home.  It is at the top of a
dimly-lit four story walk-up.

</b>ttYa sister knows I'm comin'?

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttYeah, sure -- She's very

<b>INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Paulie unlocks the apartment door and enters... Rocky
stiffly follows.  Paulie's sister steps out of the kitchen.
A large serving spoon is in her hand... The TV is on.

She stops short and eyes Rocky... She is visibly unsettled
by Rocky's unexpected presence.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttt(weakly)
ttPaulie, you're late.

She looks at Rocky again.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttDid you call the hospital?
ttt(to Rocky)
ttIf I'm ten minutes late, she
ttcalls the hospital.

Adrian enters the bedroom and slams the door... Paulie
follows.  An argument ensues and Rocky overhears.

OVER the argument is HEARD a SPORTS BROADCAST rising from
the TELEVISION.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR (V.O.)
</b>tt... Unfortunate luck for

in the bedroom.

</b>tt... Paulie, why didn't you

tthome?!  Look at me, I'm not

</b>ttI can't go out.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttPaulie, it's Thanksgiving.
ttI've gotta turkey in the oven.

Paulie turns and leaves the bedroom... He enters the kitchen.
Grabbing a large fork, he opens the oven and spears the
turkey... With the turkey suspended on the end of the fork,
Paulie heaves the dripping bird out the window.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt41.

Adrian has seen this and is shattered.  She runs back into
the bedroom and locks the door.

</b>ttForget nothin' -- Here, talk

Rocky walks over to Adrian's bedroom door and begins speaking
to the enclosed girl.

</b>tt... Yo, Adrian, it's me,

ttkinda hard for me to think of

Rocky turns away and begins to walk off.

Adrian opens the door... She already has her winter coat on.

ttWe'll have a good time.

Paulie opens the front door and gives Rocky an encouraging

The Cleaner yells from the sideline.

Adrian does a slight turn and Rocky has to speed up and
nearly falls.

</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSee, I ain't graceful,

carefully across the ice.

ttThat's ten bucks.

Rocky and Adrian start to leave.  Rocky pauses at the door

Rocky goes to the icebox.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWould ya like a glass of water?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt... No thanks.

Adrian looks at the mirror above Rocky's dresser.  She sees
a high school photo of Rocky.  He once was handsome and
smooth-faced... Rocky steps up behind her and his face is
reflected in the mirror.

He turns on his cheap RECORD PLAYER... He reaches into the
turtle bowl.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHere's the guys I was tellin'

</b>ttt(continuing)
tt!!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's

Rocky closes the window and faces the woman... She is not

</b>ttt(continuing; softly)
ttWould ya take off your glasses?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttt(dumbstruck)
ttWhat?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttThe glasses... Please.

Rocky removes her glasses and looks deeply into her eyes.

tt... T-thank you.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttDo me another favor?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt... What?

</b>ttCould ya take off that hat.

After a moment, Adrian removes the hat... She is becoming
rather pretty.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI always knew you was pretty.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttDon't tease me.

The woman melts into the corner and begins lightly sobbing...
Rocky steps forward and fences her with his arms and body.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't
tthave to kiss me back if ya
ttdon't feel like it.

Rocky softly kisses the woman... Her arms hang limp.  He
puts more passion into the kiss and she starts to respond.
Her hand glides like smoke up his back.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt52.
</b>

She embraces his neck.  The dam of passion erupts.  She
gives herself freely for the first time in thirty years.

<b>EXT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY
</b>
The following day, Rocky strolls down the street to
Goldmill's Gym... Out front a group of young blacks stop
talking and study Rocky as he passes.  Rocky's eyebrows knit
in confusion.

<b>INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY
</b>
Rocky climbs the stairs and enters the gym...

... In a matter of seconds, his presence is known and the
athletes stare in wonderment... The big black heavyweight
contender, Dipper, throws down his towel in disgust and
turns away.

Mike quietly approaches Rocky.

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttHey, Rock -- What happened?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt'Bout what?

Mickey Goldmill steps out of his office...

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttDid ya get the message, kid?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttMessage -- What message?

Mickey pulls out a card from his breast pocket... He hands
it to Rocky.

</b>ttHere's the card?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWhen was they here?
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt53.
</b>

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>tt'Bout an hour ago.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttProbably lookin' for sparrin'
ttpartners.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>tt... I said that before.

Rocky turns from Mickey and jogs out of the gym.  Mickey
fumbles with his rosary beads.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt... Waste of life.

<b>EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY
</b>
Rocky steps off a bus in mid-town Philadelphia.  He hurries
down Broad Street.  Every few steps he breaks into a trot...
He enters a skyscraper.

<b>INT. OFFICE BUILDING - HALL - DAY
</b>
Rocky exits the elevator and enters the office of Miles
Jergens' Productions.

<b>INT. JERGENS' PRODUCTIONS - DAY
</b>
The SECRETARY is slightly startled by Rocky's excited
expression.

<b>ttttSECRETARY
</b>ttMay I help you?

Rocky hands her the business card.

<b>ttttSECRETARY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYour name, please?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttBalboa, Rocky Balboa.

The Secretary rises and enters Jergens' office... Rocky eyes
the multitude of sporting pictures hanging on all four walls.

The Secretary returns.

<b>ttttSECRETARY
</b>ttYou may go in.

Rocky collects himself and enters...
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt54.
</b>

<b>INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Miles Jergens warmly greets him.

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttHello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles
ttJergens -- Please, have a seat.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Thanks.

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttMr. Balboa --

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(overriding)
ttRocky.

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttRocky, do you have any
ttrepresentation?  A manager?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttNo -- Just me.

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttRocky, would you be interested
ttin --

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttSparrin'?

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttExcuse me.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI know ya need sparrin'
ttpartners -- I'm very available.

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttI'm sure you are.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttAbsolutely -- Sparrin' with
ttthe Champ would be an honor --
tty'know what?

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI wouldn't take no cheap shots.
ttI'd be a good sparrin' partner.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt55.
</b>

Jergens seems very amused.  He lights a cigar.

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttRocky, would you be interested
ttin fighting Apollo Creed for
ttthe Championship?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Like I said, I'd make a
ttboss sparrin' mate.

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttDid you hear what I said?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttSure, an' I'm smart enough to
ttknow that no sparrin' partner
ttshould take cheap shots at the
ttChamp.  He's just there to
tthelp condition the man.

<b>ttttJERGENS
</b>ttNot spar, I'm asking whether
ttyou would be interested in
ttfighting Creed for the
ttchampionship.

The weight of the statement comes crashing down in Rocky.
For a long moment he becomes nothing more than a basket case
as he ponders the statement... He half regains his senses.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Ah... Absolutely.

The SCENE FADES and becomes a black and white television.

<b>INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky and Adrian are at her home watching an old black and
white television... Rocky smiles... The film now cuts to
Apollo being interviewed.

<b>ttttREPORTER #1
</b>ttHow'd you like the 'City of
ttBrotherly Love?'

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttI like my Philadelphia Brothers.
ttAn' I'm patriotic!

Apollo has to move to the side to avoid a thrusting
microphone.
<b> 
</b>

</b>

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttt(continuing;
tttmock seriousness)
ttIf yo' don't back up I'm gonna

The Reporters laugh.

<b>ttttREPORTER #2
</b>ttWhy did you agree to fight a
ttman who has virtually no
ttchance of winning?

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttIf history proves one thing,
tteverybody gotta chance --
ttDidn't yo' all ever hear of
ttDavid an' Goliath? -- 'Course
ttI woulda knocked out Goliath.

<b>ttttREPORTER #3
</b>ttIt is a coincidence that
ttyou're fighting a white man on
ttthe most celebrated day in the
ttcountry's history?

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttThe same coincidence that he's
ttfightin' a black man.

<b>ttttREPORTER #1
</b>ttWhat're your feelings about
ttthe challenger?

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttHe's Italian.

<b>ttttREPORTER #1
</b>ttWhat does that mean?

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttIt means if he can't fight, I
ttbet he can cook!

Rocky and Adrian laugh at the interview... Paulie, her
brother, takes offense.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttDo me a favor -- His lungs,
ttpunch 'em out.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttPaul.
<b> 
</b>

Rocky's interview now fills the screen.  Rocky squints and
looks nervous under the hot lights.

</b>ttThis is your largest payday

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttFeel?  I dunno... Happy.

ttCreed's great, ain't he...
ttI'll do what I can.

<b>ttttREPORTER #1
</b>ttWhere did you get the name,
tt'Italian Stallion?'

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI thought of it 'bout eight
ttyears ago, when I was eatin'
ttdinner.

<b>ttttREPORTER #2
</b>ttIs it true the most you've
ttever made in a prizefight is
ttfive hundred dollars?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttFour hundred -- But that was a
ttlong time ago.

<b>ttttREPORTER #2
</b>ttAnd now your payday will be
ttone hundred and fifty thousand
ttdollars.  Any comment?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttListen, I wanna say hi to my

Adrian blushes and laughs.

</b>ttOh, Rocky!

<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt58.
</b>

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttYou didn't!

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttSure I did.  You heard.

They continue to watch the remainder of the interview... The
head COMMENTATOR is looking directly into the camera.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>ttA Bicentennial Fight --
ttJanuary first.  It will be the
ttfirst sporting event on our

ttmore than a minute I would say

ttt(sarcastically)
ttIt's matches like this with

ttThe guy's a friggin' moron.

</b>ttHelp what?

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttY'know, to help keep ya livin'

</b>ttI'll do okay.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttYa gotta have a guy help ya

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHey, who cared about me
ttyesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I
ttthink I'm gonna train myself.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttWithout havin' good people
ttaround, ya won't have such a
ttgood chance.

Adrian is not happy with her brother's overbearing attitude.
She faces him.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttEinstein flunked out of
ttschool... twice.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttThat so.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttRoosevelt finished last in his

ttI think Rocky has a good chance.

<b>INT. HALLWAY OF PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky stands in Adrian's doorway.  He kisses her.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttSee ya tomorrow.

Rocky moves down the stairway and continues to do so as he
converses with Adrian who remains upstairs.  His VOICE
ECHOES up the stairwell.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt60.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHow'd ya like hearin' ya name
tton TV?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttI don't know -- I was shocked.
ttWhy did you do that?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYa puttin' me on, right?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttt(smiles)
ttAbsolutely -- What time should
ttI expect you?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt'Bout seven.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttI'll be waiting.

Rocky is now on the ground floor yelling up to Adrian on the
top floor landing.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttY'know how I said that stuff
tton television didn't bother me?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttIt did.

As Rocky completes the last word, he exits the building and
slams the door which RESOUNDS throughout the apartment house.

<b>EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
Gazzo, the bodyguard, and Rocky are standing out front.
They are eating hot sandwiches.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttY'know I won't be able to work
ttfor ya no more.

<b>ttttGAZZO
</b>ttHey -- if a good man can make

<b>ttttGAZZO
</b>ttTake your shot, kid -- You got

</b>ttA few bucks.

Gazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills.

<b>ttttGAZZO
</b>ttHere's five hundred -- Put it
ttin your glove.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttDo I have to pay juice?

Gazzo looks at the Bodyguard and shakes his head as if to
imply, "Why's this guy asking such a foolish question?"

Gazzo and the bodyguard step to the white Caddy parked at
the curb.  They enter the cab.  Rocky watches.

ttEven when I owned you in '66
ttyou never had luck.  But now I

Rocky smiles and Gazzo gets into his car.  Rocky follows him
across the street.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky returns home and enters his apartment.  After turning
on the light, he flips on his RECORD PLAYER.  He now feeds
the turtles.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttLook who's home!

Rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold.  He
approaches them with a sense of awe.  He opens and reads one.
Settling on the bed, he reads the other.

A KNOCK is HEARD.  Rocky opens the door.  Mickey Goldmill,
the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(stiffly)
ttI seen the light.  I figure
ttsomebody was home.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin'
tthere?  Here, sit down.

Rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttBest seat in the house -- Hey,
ttMick, this is too much.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttHow do you mean?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI'm usta seein' ya at the gym,
ttbut seein' ya here, in my
tthouse, it's kinda outta joint.

By the manner in which Goldmill listens, it is obvious
something important is preying on his mind.

Rocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at
having outsiders see how he lives.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttListen, Rock, you're a very
ttlucky guy.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt64.
</b>

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttWhat's happened is freak luck.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttFreak luck for sure.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttLook at all them other fighters.
ttReal good boys.  Good records.
ttColorful.  Fight their hearts
ttout for peanuts -- But who
ttcared?  Nobody.  They got it
ttshoved in their back door.
ttNobody ever give them a shot
ttat the title...

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(uneasy)
ttFreak luck is a strange thing.

Mickey does not hear.  His attention is drawn to the turtles.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttWhatta' those?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttTurtles -- domestic turtles.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(businesslike)
ttI'm here tellin' ya to be very
ttsmart with this shot.  Like
ttthe Bible sez, ya don't get no

Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes.

</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYa need a manager.  An advisor.
ttI been in the racket fifty
ttyears.  I done it all, there
ttain't nothin' about the world

He lights a half-smoked cigar.

</b>ttt(at a loss)
ttFifty years, huh.

ttHe had a manager -- September

</b>
<b>ttttROCKY

ttYa got a good mind for dates.

Mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttLook at this face -- twenty-
ttone stitches over the left
tteye, thirty-four over the
ttright -- my nose was busted
ttseventeen times, the last

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttNobody ever said that --
ttThere's his picture.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttYeah, ya kinda remind me of
ttthe Rock.  Ya move like 'im.

Mickey has rung the bell.  Nothing could please Rocky more
than being compared to his idol.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttReally think so?

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttYa got heart.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHeart, but I ain't got no

Rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a
crouch.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttChrist, I know this business.

remains on one knee.

</b>ttIf ya was wantin' my help, why

ttRocky, I'm seventy-six years

ttwinner I never was -- your
ttshot is my last shot!

Rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the
door.

Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves.

Several moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself
into bed.  Springing up a second later, he runs outside.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt69.
</b>

<b>EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form
of Mickey.  Way in the distance, we SEE Rocky stop the old
man beneath a street lamp.  He places an arm around his
shoulder.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN
</b>
The following morning, Rocky's ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF at
exactly four A.M.  Not accustomed to rising this early, with
great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to
the bathroom.  He turns the light on and roaches scatter.

At the top of the mirror hang the telegrams.  Rocky fills
the basin and submerges his face in cold water.

Rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs.  He
cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one
swill... his body quivers.

<b>EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Rocky steps outside.  He is dressed in a well-worn sweat
suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers.  It is pitch dark and
his steaming breath attests to the cold.

He begins running down the center of the deserted street.
He can only be clearly SEEN as his form passes beneath the
street lamps.

Two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass.

<b>EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAWN
</b>
Rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight
of stairs.  He stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear
into the morning gray.  Taking a deep breath, he starts up.
From the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his
legs give way.  Standing, he brushes off and descends the
stairs.

<b>EXT. CITY HALL - DAWN
</b>
Rocky passes City Hall and veers to the river.  He pauses,
heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths.  He throws several
lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his
aching sides.  Men delivering the morning papers observe
with amusement.

Rocky forces himself to begin running again.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt70.
</b>

<b>EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN STATION - DAWN
</b>
Heading along Spring Garden Street, Rocky passes beneath an
elevated train station.  The ROARING TRAIN overhead seems to
blend perfectly with his muscular running style.

<b>EXT. DOCKS - DAWN
</b>
The sky is beginning to lighten.  The fighter now runs along
the piers and past anchored freighters.

<b>EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN
</b>
It is five-thirty and Rocky approaches the loading platform
belonging to Eastern Packing Company.  Alongside the loading
platform come several boxcars.

Rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door.  It soon
opens and Paulie guides him inside.  Paulie is drunk.

<b>INT. SHIPPING OFFICE - DAY
</b>

</b>ttHow ya feelin'?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(panting)
tt... Tight.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttI got whiskey here.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... No.

Rocky notices TWO PUERTO RICANS lounging alongside theshipping office.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttThis is the guy who's fightin'
ttApollo Creed.

<b>ttttJOSE
</b>ttt(heavy accent)
ttGood luck -- Kill him, man.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(as though

ttHip -- Hip -- Hooray!  C'mon --
ttHip -- Hip --

ttHooray, man.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttRock'll be comin' by every
ttmornin' to pick up some
ttPrime -- can't train on that
ttstore crap.

Rocky smiles and Paulie leads him out of the office and to
the large metal door of a walk-in refrigerator.

<b>INT. FREEZER - DAY
</b>
They enter.  The freezer resembles a modern torture chamber...
row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the
darkness to the far end of the refrigerator.  The blower
overhead causes the men to speak loudly.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(teasing)
ttIf ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end
ttup hangin' on the hook, right?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttGazzo's a good man.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttHow 'bout you talk to 'em
ttabout me?
ttt(tightly)
ttPlease do me that favor.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttKeep this job, ya eat better.

Paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat.  He
swills whiskey from a pint bottle.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttY'know, d'ya think you an' my
ttsister -- Ah, doin' good
tttogether?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWhatta you think?

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttAin't sure, what's the story?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWhat?
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt72.
</b>

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttThe story -- what's happenin'?

Paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for
quite a while.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYa really like her?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttSure I like her.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(nervous laughter)
ttWhat's the attraction?  I
ttdon't see it?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI dunno -- she fills gaps.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttWhat gaps?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(shrugs and
ttttakes meat)
ttShe got gaps.  I got gaps --
tttogether we fill the gaps.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(sharply)
ttYou ballin' her?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(turns around)
ttDon't talk dirty 'bout ya
ttsister.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(tersely)
ttC'mon, ya screwin' her?

From across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttThat's why I can't put ya
tttogether with Gazzo, cause ya
tttalk too much -- big mouth.

Paulie reddens.  He steps forward and slams his fists in a
hanging beef.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt73.
</b>

The punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky
responds.

Rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs.

The grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging
corpse.  Rocky moves to the next one and hooks.

Rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as
though he were locked in total battle.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttHit the rump.  The rump!
ttYa'll break the ribs!

Rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of
beef.  Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every
punch, like he were receiving it.  Rocky moves into the dark
recess of the refrigerator.  Only the dull SOUNDS of his
POUNDING FISTS can be HEARD.

Rocky works his way to Paulie again.  Every hanging beef
swings and appears surrealistically alive.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWe do that to Creed an'
ttthey'll take us to jail for
ttmurder.

Rocky looks at his hands.  They are drenched in red up to
the elbows with beef blood.

Paulie hands him a package of beef.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttDon't talk dirty 'bout ya
ttsister.

Rocky takes the package and runs out.  Paulie's bleary eyes
reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment.

<b>INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY
</b>
The gym is filled to capacity.  The NOISE is DEAFENING.
Rocky pounds a heavy bag.

Mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his
pocket.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt74.
</b>

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(passionate)
ttStop!  Stop!  I can't stand it!
ttIt's clumsy.  You're off
ttbalance.

He motions to his bullish helper, Mike.  He hands him the
string.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttTie it to both ankles -- Leave
tttwo feet slack.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI never had good footwork.

Mike completes the task.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttForget the footwork -- You're
ttoff balance.  The legs are
ttsticking everywhere.  Marciano
tthad the same problem, an' the
ttstring cured it.  When you can
tthit and move without breakin'
ttthe string you'll have balance.

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttYou'll be a very dangerous

Two young boys in street clothes interrupt Mickey.

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttRocky, could we have your
ttautograph?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Sure.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(irate)
ttDon't you boys ever interrupt

The boys depart.

</b>
<b>ttttttttt75.
</b>

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAutographs!  Ya wanna be a
ttwriter or a fighter?  Let's
ttwork.

Mike looks off across the gym.

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>tt... we got visitors.

Mickey strains his eyes to see a group of REPORTERS and NEWS
CAMERAMEN entering his gym.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(approaching)
ttCan I help you guys?

<b>ttttREPORTER
</b>ttt(to Cameraman)
ttSet the camera up over there.
ttt(to Mickey)
ttWe're from Channel Seven --
ttCovering the pre-fight training.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttI own the place.

The Reporter has a hundred things on his mind... he turns
from Mickey and nods to his crew... the other television
crews rush to set up.

<b>ttttCAMERAMAN
</b>ttRolling here.

<b>ttttSOUND MAN
</b>ttSpeed here.

<b>ttttREPORTER
</b>ttt(to the camera)
ttWe're here at Goldmill's

ttcorner.  The sweat a trademark
ttof a unique profession... Yet,
ttthe most unique fixture is an
ttunprecedented 50 to 1 underdog
ttheavyweight named, Rocky Balboa.

The camera turns to Rocky.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt76.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(to Mickey)
ttShould I do this?

Mickey nods and Rocky faces the glaring lights.

<b>ttttREPORTER
</b>ttSo much has happened lately --
ttHas it changed your life style
ttmuch?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... People talk to me more.

<b>ttttREPORTER
</b>ttHow're you preparing for this
ttBicentennial bout?

A young punchy fighter yells out:

<b>ttttFIGHTER
</b>ttReadin' fuckin' history books,
ttman!

The gym explodes with laughter.

<b>ttttREPORTER
</b>ttt(flushed)
ttWe can cut that out later.
ttApollo Creed says he'll let

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(honestly)
ttApollo's a great fighter.

<b>ttttREPORTER
</b>ttDo you feel you have a chance?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttMaybe --

He faces Mickey.  Mickey whispers in his ear.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI'll tear his head off.

<b>ttttREPORTER
</b>ttDo you have anything derogatory
ttto say about the Champion?
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt77.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttDerogatory?  Yeah, he's great.

Apollo Creed and his entourage enter the gym.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttt(bellowing)
ttI am the Champion of the whole
ttworld!!!

The gym freezes... everyone turns and stares in wonderment...
Mickey Goldmill shakes his head in disbelief.  He now
realizes it is a publicity stunt.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttt(approaching Rocky)
ttItalian Stallion, I come over

Apollo turns to the cameras... Rocky is speechless.

ttThis classic fight -- Tha's

Dipper stands in the far ring... the attention Rocky is
receiving makes him a killer.

ttApollo Creed is one DAMN

Everyone laughs... Dipper moves across the room like a large
snake.  He brushes people aside and steps behind Rocky.  He
nudges him... Rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it.

Dipper pushes harder and Rocky looks questioningly at him.

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttt(loud)
ttYa nothin', Boy!

Apollo stops his sales pitch in mid-sentence... The
television crew faces Dipper.

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI say ya nothin'!

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttWhat's happenin' here?

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttI'm happenin'!  This pig is

</b>ttt(dumbstruck)
ttYo', Dipper, why're ya --

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttt(shaking his fist)
ttSpar me in front of these here
ttTV dudes -- I knock ya ass to
ttJersey!

Dipper's fat black trainer holds out his hands and Dipper
slaps them soul style.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(to Dipper)
ttYou can forget about sparring,
ttkid.

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttYo' know I iz the best man

</b>

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(almost

tttto the crew)
ttWhy let Rocky here take a

ttDipper.

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttDon't mouth me, old man, I'll
ttknock yo' out too.  C'mon,
ttwop, spar me, let everybody
ttsee who's got the heat around
tthere.

Silence looms over the gym... Apollo is apprehensive.  The
scene is becoming too real.  The frightened television crew
slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment.

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttt(continuing; insanely)
ttMan, yo' best keep them
ttcameras out!  Fight me, boy!
ttLet Creed here see the kind of
ttpunk he's fightin'!

Mike forces his way through the crowd and stands behind Rocky.

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttDon't chance it, man -- He's
ttsick.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttThis is gettin' outta hand --
ttRocky will fight in the ring
ttJanuary first, not here!

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttYo' yellow, old man.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttNot yellow, cautious.
ttt(to the crew)
ttSee, it's very easy for a
ttfighter to accidentally hurt --

Dipper suddenly steps forward and slaps Rocky very hard
across the side of the head... The gym becomes stone cold.
Dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt80.
</b>

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttIf yo're afraid to fight me,
ttthen get down an' kiss my
ttfeet, boy.

Mickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds
before the blood will run... Rocky stands motionless.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(softly)
ttLet's take a walk, Rock.
ttPlease, don't take a chance.
ttHe wants to hurt you so you
ttcan't fight.

Rocky swallows his pride.  He still has the string around
his ankles.  He starts to shuffle away with Mickey... Dipper
steps forward and viciously slaps Rocky again.

Mike jumps forward.

<b>ttttMIKE
</b>ttWhy you tryin' to cut 'im, man!
ttBack off, scumbag, or I'll
ttbite your face!

Dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks Mike flat.  The
room reeks of fear... Apollo's eyes flick back and forth
between Rocky and Dipper.  Apollo taps his bodyguards and
they begin to ease away.

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>tt... Now, boy, kiss my feet.

Rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor.  He shuffles
forward and stands before Dipper.

<b>ttttDIPPER
</b>ttt(continuing;
tttalmost in a whisper)
tt... Kiss 'em.

Rocky looks at Mickey, then lowers his eyes to Dipper's
feet... Dipper smiles.  Rocky starts to bend towards the
shoes.  Without warning, he explodes with a pair of
combinations into Dipper's exposed ribs.  A CRACK is HEARD
and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... The room
is silent except for Dipper's moaning.

Apollo is stunned by the scene.  The gym has become a very
gloomy place.  He eyes Rocky with admiration and a hint of
apprehension... He leaves.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt81.
</b>

Mickey is the first one to shake off the chill... He shakes
his fists at the Reporters, and puts his arm around Rocky.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttThe kid's got cannons -- Print
ttthat.

The crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken
figure lying on a dirty gym floor.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
They enter the dismal apartment... On the floor are at least
ten telegrams.  Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside.
Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams.
<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttDon't you open them anymore?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttThey either say, 'Kill the
ttnigger' or 'Hope you die,
ttHonky.' -- What ya got in the
ttbag?

Adrian steps to the window.  She pulls a pair of short but
lovely curtains from a shopping bag... The colorful curtains
glare in the dark room.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttLike?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttSharp -- Real nice.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttReally -- You don't think
ttthey're overly feminine?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttNo... Sharp -- You look great.

Adrian smiles and pulls out a small Christmas wreath...
Rocky smiles.  His eyes show what he feels for this woman.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttAdrian, you really look great,
tty'know -- But I can't fool
ttaround durin' trainin' --
ttmakes the legs weak.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttDon't want weak legs.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt82.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttCan't fool around -- You look
ttvery great.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt-- The legs.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah... But I think weak legs
ttain't bad sometimes, y'know.

Rocky approaches in a seductive manner.  Adrian
uncharacteristically removes her sweater.  Underneath is a
T-shirt that reads "Win, Rocky, Win."

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttI thought it might be cute.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYa right --
ttt(laughs)
ttMebbe we best just hold
tthands -- the shirt made me
ttfeel guilty, y'know.

<b>SCENE FADES.
</b>
<b>EXT. STREET - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Rocky is running... for extra weight he carries his huge
dog, Butkus.  After a half a block he sags under the weight,
and laughing, begins to wrestle with the dog on the
pavement... Rocky tries to sneak away from the dog, but
after a few steps the beast sees him and chases him down the
street.

<b>EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN
</b>
It is early morning and as usual Rocky jogs to the meathouse.
He is followed by his new dog, Butkus.  He is stopped short
when he notices several television news vans parked out front.

<b>INT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN
</b>
He and the dog enter the freezer area and see several
reporters and men with mini-cameras milling around... Paulie
is waiting for him -- Rocky is upset and goes outside.
Paulie follows.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt83.
</b>

<b>EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN
</b>
<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttYo, Rock.  I made a few phone

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttI thought I was doin' ya a

ttY'know, my sister really likes
ttya.

Rocky follows Paulie inside.

<b>INT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAY
</b>
A REPORTER points in Rocky's direction and suddenly he is
surrounded and led into the freezer area and positioned
beside a slab of hanging beef.  The camera lights go on.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>ttJust relax, Mr. Balboa --
ttt(to the camera)
ttToday we're here with
ttheavyweight challenger, Rocky
ttBalboa.  The reason we are
ttstanding in a refrigerated box
ttis that Mr. Balboa has an
ttunusual method of training and

tthow did you ever come to train
ttin an icebox?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttAh -- My buddy Paulie let me
ttin one day an' I hit the beef
tthere an' liked it -- An' since

ttfighters pound raw meat?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttI think me and Paulie invented
ttit.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>ttWould you give us a
ttdemonstration?

Rocky steps over to a hanging beef and begins pounding with
incredible intensity... Everyone present is taken aback.
Rocky completes hitting the meat and stands there with his
hands dripping beef blood.

The Commentator is unnerved and Rocky looks straight into
the camera lens and holds up his bloody fists.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR
</b>tt... Diane Lewis in the
ttmeathouse with the Southpaw,
ttRocky Balboa.

<b>INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Apollo sits behind Jergens' desk.  Jergens is not present.
Four middle-aged and younger types and Creed's lawyer sit
around the desk.  The desk is flowing with forms and charts.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttHow much is being channeled

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttYeah, I'd like to get Canada --

ttbreak -- Gimme the figures on
ttthe Program Concession.

Meanwhile, the trainer sits across the room in a darkened
corner looking at a small television.  He is watching
Rocky's bloody exhibition on the news...

He waves at Apollo.

<b>ttttTRAINER
</b>ttt(worried)
ttApollo, you oughta come see
ttthis boy you're gonna fight on

Apollo is still engrossed in his paperwork.

ttThe gross rental of the arena

tthundred ushers, right? --
ttGimme some coffee.

<b>EXT. PAULIE'S STREET - NIGHT
</b>
It is a moonless night and Paulie staggers across the street
and enters his building... He staggers up the stairs.

<b>INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Paulie removes his coat and tosses it listlessly in a
chair... He rubs his red eyes and sways into the kitchen.

He takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox.  As he swills
the wine he hears the SOUND of Rocky's and Adrian's VOICES
traveling from his sister's room.  Paulie's face tightens
and he staggers towards the bedroom.

He stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a
crack... Rocky, Adrian, and the dog are watching TV in the
otherwise darkened room.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt... And he called the
ttreporters --

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah... Threw my whole day off.

room.

bordering on a nervous breakdown.

ttOutta my house I want ya!!
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt87.

ttYou forget what I went through

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttI always seen ya had the best,

Paulie smashes a large lamp with the bat.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttDon't do that again!

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttGet away from me -- I could
ttnever even get married 'cause

The brother flares up and threatens Adrian with the bat.

</b>ttYou busted?!

Mortified, Adrian runs to her room... Rocky steps to Paulie.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(fuming)
ttHey --

Paulie cocks the bat back and tenses... Rocky remains still.

<b>ttttPAULIE

</b>ttWhat can I do about it?

<b>ttttPAULIE

Paulie looks ashamed... Rocky walks, then returns.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt... An' what ya said to my
ttgirlfriend ain't right -- Do
ttit again, I'll kill ya.

Rocky goes into the bedroom... Adrian has buried her face in
a pillow... She is rocking slightly.  Rocky cradles her and
kisses her cheek.

ttWanna hear a dirty joke?

<b>INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Mickey is in his cluttered office above the gym... the room
is dark.  Blankets are tacked over the windows.  Rocky is
watching 8 mm movies of Apollo Creed in action... Rocky
watches with intense concentration as the fighter moves like
a huge dancer around the ring.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttHis defense is great, can't
ttlie 'bout that -- You have a
ttrollin' style.  Can't retreat

They both watch the flickering images.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSee how he plays sometimes --
ttDrives his cornermen nuts.
ttNobody knows his next move --
ttHim included.

They watch more action... Creed has a fighter helpless
against the ropes.

</b>ttt(continuing)
ttKiller instinct -- Ya both got
ttthe killer touch.  Interestin'.
ttSee that! -- Right-cross

They watch more action.

The SCENE FADES on Mickey's voice and Rocky staring
transfixed at the images projecting on the wall...

<b>INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY
</b>
Rocky is pounding the heavy bag with intense concentration.
As he strikes from all angles, Mickey instructs.

<b>INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - LATER
</b>
Rocky now works on the incline situp board... While doing
situps, he pounds himself in the stomach with a dumbbell.
The pain is evident on his face.

<b>INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER
</b>
Pushups between two chairs as Mike sits on his shoulders...
Mickey coaching drives him on.

<b>INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER
</b>
Mike has on a pair of target gloves and Rocky moves around
the ring swinging at them.

<b>INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER
</b>
Drenched in sweat, Rocky hums the speed bag.  His expression
is hard and flushed.  Mickey clicks a stopwatch and pats
Rocky's shoulder... He is very happy.

<b>INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER
</b>
Rocky has just completed exercising with the medicine ball...
Dino hands him a towel... Paulie crosses the gym as Rocky
heads to the steam room... A thin man crosses the gym and
Mickey nods.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttWhat cha say, Benny -- Meet
tt'The Rock.' This is our
ttcutman, Benny Stein.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYo, Benny.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttCheck the eyes, Ben.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt92.
</b>

Benny checks the skin around Rocky's eyes.

<b>ttttBENNY
</b>ttAin't bad.  Seen worse --
ttCover up an' things should be
ttokay.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttTake a shower.

Heading towards the shower, Rocky is intercepted by Paulie
who traverses the gym.  He stops Rocky at the shower room
entrance.

<b>ttttPAULIE
</b>ttYo, Rock, I think I found an
ttangle to make some bread usin'
ttya name, ya mind?

Exhausted, Rocky studies Paulie's face a moment and nods
'yes.'... Rocky sways into the shower room and Paulie
strides off.

<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
Running... Rocky's crowd of trailing boys has tripled.
Dashing through the streets, he resembles the Pied Piper.

<b>EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAY
</b>
It is twilight and Rocky is alone at the very bottom of a
huge flight of steps that seem to stretch into the heavens...
Rocky takes a deep breath and sprints up the never-ending
stairs... Halfway up, his body shows the strain.  Nearing
the top, Rocky pumps with all his strength and arrives at
the very top... He looks down the steep stairs and swells
with pride... He is ready.

<b>INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Rocky is led into Mayor Rizzo's office by an aide... Rocky
is very nervous as he approaches the mayor, who is seated
behind his wide desk.

<b>ttttMAYOR
</b>ttSit down, Rocky.

Flips open a thick file that lays in front of him.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt93.
</b>

<b>ttttMAYOR

ttI've been going over your

Rocky tries to sink into the chair.

<b>ttttMAYOR
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI'm a very busy man, but I
ttjust wanted to remind you that
ttyou'll be setting an example
ttfor thousands of guys like

ttto Philadelphia.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... I'll try.

The mayor presses a button and a photographer enters.

<b>ttttMAYOR
</b>ttWould you stand up, please.

Rocky rises and the mayor shakes his hand... Their picture
is taken three times... The photographer exits.

<b>ttttMAYOR
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThank you for coming by,
ttRocky -- good luck.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(turns)
ttAny time.

<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt94.

<b>ttttROCKY

tt... Run for mayor.

The mayor is shocked at first but then breaks into a big,
friendly laugh, and Rocky exits.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Adrian and Rocky are at his apartment.  They are looking at
new scrapbooks.  Newsweek Magazine: Headline: "The Italian
Stallion or Donkey?" -- Philadelphia Magazine -- Rocky
stands with the mayor.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttRocky, do you realize everybody
ttin this country knows your

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah...

She flips through Sports Illustrated, The American Sportsman,
Ring Magazine, World Boxing, True, and a multitude of other
clippings.

The TELEPHONE RINGS... Rocky rises and walks to the new
white object hanging on the wall.

Adrian overhears the statement.

Rocky grabs his coat and moves to the front door.

</b>
<b>ttttttttt96.
</b>

<b>INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky arrives at Goldmill's Gym... He unlocks the gym's door.
Rocky and the dog move through the eerie shadows of the gym.

Rocky moves across the gym with his dog and moves up the
steps to Mickey's office... At the top of the stairs he
looks down at the ring, reflects for a moment, then enters
the office.

<b>INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
After turning on the lights, he quickly cleans the cluttered
desk and sets up the projector... He goes to the cabinet and
removes a stack of 16 mm films.

<b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER
</b>
The office clock indicates it is several hours later.  Rocky
is engrossed in watching another Apollo Creed film.  He sits
motionless.

Rocky sits upright.  Something catches his eyes... He
springs at the projector.  He reruns the scene several times.

<b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER
</b>
Several hours later Rocky is engrossed in watching another
Apollo Creed film... He sits motionless.  Something catches
his eye.  Rocky stops the projector as Apollo is delivering
a knockout blow to an unfortunate opponent.

Rocky moves right up to freeze frame and inspects it like it
was a priceless painting... He backs off and begins writing
on a note pad.

<b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAWN
</b>
The first light of dawn streams through Mickey's filthy
windows... Rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he
has lost interest in watching the movies.

The film has completed its run through the projector and
lazily flops around on the top reel... Listlessly Rocky rubs
his reddened eyes.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt97.
</b>

The door opens and Mickey flips on the light... The two men
stare at each other for a long moment.  Mickey studies
Rocky's despondent expression and knows what is on the
fighter's mind.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>tt... I know what you're
ttthinkin'm kid -- At least ya
ttgotta shot -- All ya can do is
tttry ya' best.

Rocky stands and, with his dog, inches past Mickey and exits
the room.  Mickey walks over and turns off the projector.
He idly pushes the machine with a lazy motion until it
slides off the desk and crashes to the floor.

<b>EXT. STREET - DAWN
</b>
After leaving Mickey's gym, Rocky and his dog listlessly
move down the street and head for home.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Rocky arrives at his apartment... Adrian is asleep on the
couch.  He lowers himself beside her.  Her eyes open.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Can't do it.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt... What?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... I can't beat him.

<b>ttttADRIAN

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYeah, I can't beat him.

Adrian touches his face.

ttI weren't just another bum

Adrian touches Rocky's face... The fighter gently lowers
himself beside his woman.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt... No foolin' around.

<b>INT. ARENA - NIGHT
</b>
It is the night of the Bicentennial fight... The location is
the Philadelphia Spectrum.

The Spectrum is filling to capacity... Grandly dressed
celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into
their ringside seat.  Nearly everyone is holding a red,
white, and blue sweater...

The arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red, white and
blue.  High above the ring are huge posters of GEORGE
<b>WASHINGTON - ABE LINCOLN - DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - BEN
</b>FRANKLIN - and APOLLO CREED.

<b>INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Apollo Creed sits in his dressing room... It is dead silent
except for some NOISE that filters under the door from the
arena.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt99.
</b>

It is a CLOSE-UP of Apollo's hand being taped... The RASPING
SOUND of the adhesive tape is very pronounced.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The atmosphere is identical to Apollo's dressing room.
Adrian watches in silence as Mike wraps Rocky's hand.

Again, the most pronounced SOUND is the RASPING of the
adhesive tape.

<b>INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Apollo's other hand is being wrapped.  Dead silence except
for the TAPE and APOLLO'S BREATHING.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky's other hand is being wrapped in a CLOSE-UP.  The only
SOUND is the TAPE and ROCKY'S mounting BREATHING PATTERN.

<b>INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
CLOSE-UP of drops being placed in his nose to help increase
his intake of oxygen.  The tremendously magnified SOUND of
<b>APOLLO TAKING IN AIR.
</b>
<b>INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
CLOSE-UP of the drops being placed in Rocky's nose.

<b>INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A heavy coating of vaseline is applied around the Champion's
eyes... In an EXTREME CLOSE-UP, the eyes shine brightly with
the grease.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Grease is smeared around Rocky's eyes... In the EXTREME
CLOSE-UP several deep scars are SEEN.

<b>INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
CLOSE-UP of Apollo's trainer digging his fingers deeply into
the thick neck muscles of Apollo's upper back and neck.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
CLOSE-UP OF Mike's arms wrapped around Rocky's waist and
lifting his diaphragm up... Magnified BREATHING ROARS from
the screen.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt100.
</b>

<b>INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Apollo's trainer slips a mouthpiece into Apollo's mouth.
Apollo shakes his head and the trainer removes it and places
another one in the champ's mouth... Creed nods yes.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Everyone present is motionless as Rocky is in the bathroom.
Alone, Rocky is on his knee praying.  Completing his silent
prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror.
Suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that
in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge
of his life.

Out in the dressing room, the door opens and a guard leans
in and nods that it is time.  He leaves... Rocky steps out.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>tt... It's time, kid.

Rocky nods and moves toward Adrian.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>tt... I'll wait for you here.

Rocky nods and she kisses him.  The fighter leaves with his
trainers... Adrian is on the verge of tears.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Rocky, Mickey and Mike start down the long hallway... Up
ahead are three security guards... Rocky rubs his bare
shoulders.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYo, Mick, can I have my rob?

Rocky puts on the robe... Embroidered across the back in
flaming letters is:

<b>tt"THE ITALIAN STALLION"
</b>
tttt*Pennzoil*

Mike helps him into the robe... Mickey is not amused.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttDon't you care what the people
ttwill say?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... I'm doin' it for a friend.

<b>INT. ARENA - NIGHT
</b>
TWO RINGSIDE COMMENTATORS sit in front of a panel of closed
circuit televisions.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #1
</b>ttWe would like to welcome our
ttviewing audience to the Grand
ttWorld Championship Bicentennial
ttHeavyweight Fight -- the first
ttmajor event of the Bicentennial
ttYear... A point of interest is
ttthat the fight is being beamed
ttto more than seven hundred and
ttfifty million fans in theatres
ttin nearly every corner of the
ttworld.  I would like to
ttwelcome an old friend, and co-
ttcommentator for this evening's
ttevent -- Jimmy Michaels.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #2
</b>ttThank you, Bob.  The
ttelectricity is everywhere
tttonight.  Rocky Balboa, a
ttfifty-to-one underdog, is
ttliving a Cinderella story
ttwhich has captured peoples'
ttimaginations all over the
ttworld -- to quote a popular
ttsports magazine, 'The fighting
ttstyle should be 'The Caveman
ttAgainst the Cavalier.' From
ttthe increase in sound it
ttappears the challenger is now
ttapproaching the ring... His
ttrecord is forty-four wins,
tttwenty losses and thirty-eight
ttknockouts.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #1
</b>ttI only wonder if this man has
ttthe skill to go past three
ttrounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt102.
</b>

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
A wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring.
Many people wish Rocky well as he passes... people also hurl
insults.  From the expression on Mickey's face it is also
the greatest night of his life.  In the audience are familiar
faces from the gym.  From the back of the arena a ROAR goes
up... Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George
Washington.  He throws silver dollars.  The NOISE builds to
DEAFENING proportions.  Creed's trainer holds the rope and
Creed bounds into the ring.  He tears off the Washington
outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in
an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red,
white and blue sequined top hat.  The robe is sequined red,
white and blue.  His boxing trunks are red, white and blue
silk with stars around the waistband.  The boxing shoes
match the trunks.  On his chin is a pointed white Uncle Sam
beard.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #2
</b>ttYou could go deaf with the
ttnoise -- it undoubtedly means
ttChampion Apollo Creed is
ttheading towards the ring --

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #1
</b>ttAm I seeing right?  Creed is
ttapproaching the ring in a boat.
ttIs he supposed to be George
ttWashington?  Obviously so.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #2
</b>ttIt's been confirmed that it is
ttdefinitely an impersonation of
ttGeorge Washington -- a great
ttway to start 1976 off.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #1
</b>ttI agree.

Immediately Creed begins gracefully dancing in a wide circle.
He passes within inches of Rocky in his Uncle Sam outfit.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttI want you!  I want you!

The crowd loves the taunting.  Apollo Creed floats back to
his corner.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttDon't let 'im get you tight.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt103.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWhatta ya think that outfit
ttcost?

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
The ANNOUNCER steps to the center of the ring... Several men
in suits stand against the ropes... Paulie is dressed nicely
and sits at ringside with a pretty blonde escort.  Rocky
waves at him.  Paulie waves back and secretly gestures at
his date... Rocky smiles and gestures back.

<b>ttttANNOUNCER
</b>ttLadies and gentlemen --

The CROWD ROARS and JACK DEMPSEY waves and goes to Creed's
corner, then Rocky's.

He moves off.

ttChampion, a son of Philly,
ttSmoking Joe Frazier!

FRAZIER rumbles to the center of the ring.  The CROWD CHEERS.
Apollo puts on a show... He grimaces and gestures like he's
going to attack Frazier.  His cornermen hold him back.  They
laugh.  Frazier goes to Rocky's corner.

The arena EXPLODES and Creed puts on a display of hand speed.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
The REFEREE motions to both fighters... They step to the
center of the ring.  As the Referee explains the rules
Apollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes... The
Referee's voice fades and the fighters' expressions fill the
screen... Something soulful and frightening is being
communicated.

<b>ttttREFEREE

The fighters return to their corners.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #1
</b>ttThe Champ stings the slower

ttout a triple combination that
ttbacks Balboa into a corner --
ttoh, a solid hook by Creed, a

</b>ttCreed is down!!!

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Rocky suddenly explodes with an upswing hook to the jaw.
Creed is dropped.  The arena EXPLODES.  Creed's eyes show
disbelief.  So do Rocky's.

Rocky backs into his corner... Mickey and Mike yell at him.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttYou can do it!  Goddamnit, you
ttgot the power!  The body, get
ttthe body!!!  Ya got him goin'!

<b>ttttREFEREE

Creed is up... His playful attitude is gone... he is now all
business.  His lightning jab stings Rocky's face repeatedly.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>tt... Come at me, sucker!

Rocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's
chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed
to cringe...

Apollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
The BELL for the second round RINGS... Rocky rushes out fast
and furious.  Apollo melts out a left hook that raises a
goose egg over Rocky's eye... Apollo employs footwork that
dazzles Rocky.  He has class.  He studies Rocky and employs
his lightning jab with cutting accuracy. Still Rocky shuffles
ahead, bombarding Creed's midsection with hooks.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt108.
</b>

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
The round ends with Apollo assaulting Rocky with blinding
combinations and delivering a stupendous right cross that
flings Rocky into the ropes and shatters his nose... The
round ends.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Apollo stands in his corner and jokes with the fans, but he
is beginning to show the strain from the body punches.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttMan, I rearranged his face
ttwith that right -- The people

Rocky sits as Mickey and Benny try to reduce the swelling
around his eyes... The nose is shattered.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttYa nose is broke.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttDamn!  How's it look?

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttCan't hardly tell.  Don't

</b>ttIf you had asked anyone who

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #1
</b>ttRound three ready to start and
ttshould be interesting to see
ttif Creed can put the challenger
ttaway -- there goes the bell.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Round three... Apollo comes out dancing.  He skips and side-
steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks.  An expert ring general,
Apollo uses the ring fully.  Rocky keeps tearing in and
Creed meets the bombing attack that cause thick swelling...
Near the end of the round Rocky fires a penetrating punch to
the heart.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #1
</b>ttApollo almost sprints out of
tthis corner -- feints and
ttthrows a pair of left-right
ttcombinations.  Balboa drops
ttbeneath a left upper cut and
ttlands a very solid shot on
ttCreed's temple -- not much
ttmovement from Balboa, duck a
ttleft, a right, another left
ttand explodes with a right hook
ttto the temple -- I mean
ttexplodes.  The Champ backs off.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #2
</b>ttThere's no way Apollo expected
ttthis kind of hitting power.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #1
</b>ttNo way -- but the brilliant
ttability of the Champion to

</b>ttCreed on the offensive --
ttBalboa takes the punishment
ttand counters with a left flush
ttover the heart... that hurt.

The wallop knocks Apollo off balance... The CAMERA GOES TO A
STEEP ANGLE SHOT from the floor, VERTICALLY UP Apollo's body.
The SCENE GOES INTO SLOW MOTION... Rocky releases a
terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under Creed's eye.
Creed's face contorts with excruciation.

<b>ttttTRAINER

ttCover your face!  Cover up!

ttMy man's cut, my man's

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
The BELL SOUNDS.  Apollo's corner works frantically to close
the wound... The ring DOCTOR inspects the cut.

<b>ttttTRAINER
</b>ttBad?  Talk to me, man!

<b>ttttDOCTOR
</b>ttDeep, but passable.

<b>ttttAPOLLO

Rocky's face is in very bad shape, not cut, but wretchedly
swollen around the eyes.

</b>ttHow you holdin' up, kid?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttFine... That guy's great.

<b>SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
In the next ten rounds, Apollo cuts and slashes Rocky to
ribbons, but pays dearly... Both his eyes and lips are cut.
Welts across his midsection attest to Rocky's body-battering.

<b>INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Adrian is unable to remain alone... She is lured by the
GROWING ROAR OF THE FANS... She exits the dressing room.

<b>INT. ARENA HALL - NIGHT
</b>
Stepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor.
The MOUNTING CHEERS make her speed up.  She opens the door
at the end of the corridor and is hit by a THUNDEROUS WAVE
OF SOUND.  The guard at the door inspects her and goes back
to watching the fight.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt112.
</b>

<b>INT. ARENA - NIGHT
</b>
Adrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the
battle.  She is entranced by the power of it all.

Back in the ring, Rocky keeps grinding ahead.  He plants a
thumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces...
Rocky is game but losing.

At ringside Paulie is frantic... He is living the fight from
his seat.

Mr. Gazzo and his Bodyguard watch from the second row.
Gazzo looks proud.  The Bodyguard, impassive.

<b>INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT
</b>
A huge and lively crowd look up at the television over the
bar... They see Rocky driving Creed against the ropes and
cheer loudly.

<b>ttttANDY
</b>tt... The Rock's got real stones.

<b>INT. ARENA - NIGHT
</b>
The men are fighting with appalling tenacity.  Rocky rips
and tears into the body... Apollo counters with a ceaseless
stream of rapier-like lefts... The Challenger is seriously
outclassed.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttC'mon -- Lemme cut yo'!

Rocky wades in and Creed employs incredible footwork.  He
sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross
to Rocky's already broken nose.  Blood sprays from the wound
and red droplets drip from his chin...

Rocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a
torrent of combinations.  Rocky's eyes are closed.  But
Creed cannot drop him... The BELL RINGS.

</b>
Apollo's corner is in turmoil... The Champion is definitely
hurt.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttMy side.

<b>ttttTRAINER
</b>ttt(to Assistant)
ttGet that doctor.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttNo doctor!

<b>ttttTRAINER
</b>ttYou're hurtin', man!

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>ttNo doctor!... I'm feelin'

</b>
In Rocky's corner, things are frantic.  His eyes are swollen
shut.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttWanna keep goin'?

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttWould you keep goin'?

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>tt... Yeah.

ttNo more.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt114.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttOpen my eyes -- Please, open
ttmy eyes!

Mickey nods to Benny.  He secretly places a small ring knife
between his index and middle finger.  In one smooth movement
he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers
the draining wounds with gauze... It is done so quickly no
one is ever aware of the operation.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
At the rear of the arena Adrian looks transfixed at the ring.
She is caught up in the heat of the battle.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
The BELL RINGS for round fourteen.  Rocky bores in close,
but Apollo still has spring in his legs.  He seems determined
to end it this round... Apollo catches Rocky flush on the
jaw.  Rocky is staggered.  Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose
with pure savagery.  Rocky is driven against the ropes and
receives a devastating beating from the Champion... Rocky is
dropped.

Rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring... Everything
is a distortion.  He looks for familiar faces as though to
ask for help... Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him
to stay down.

<b>ttttREFEREE
</b>ttSix -- Seven -- Eight --

Rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy.  He
is like a wounded wild animal.  The tide suddenly turns.
Rocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific
body punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his
throat... A CRACK is HEARD.  A glaze of pain covers Apollo's
eyes.  It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion
upright... Apollo is badly hurt.  He is bent over.

Rocky moves towards Apollo.  Apollo flicks dread jabs into
Rocky's eyes... The Italian wades in with punches that seem
to bulge out Apollo's back.  Creed takes the punishment like
a stoic.

Blood is running from Apollo's mouth.  In the clinch he
leans over Rocky and it drips down the Italian's neck and
shoulders.  Apollo shields his wound from the ringside
judges and continues to fight.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt115.
</b>

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
The BELL RINGS.  Apollo's men rush out and guide him to his
corner.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>tt... Ribs broke --

Blood trickles from the corner of Apollo's mouth.  The
Trainer feels the ribs.

</b>ttYo' bleedin' inside, man --
ttGet that doctor.

<b>ttttAPOLLO

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>tt... Thanks.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Rocky no longer resembles himself... His face has completely
been beaten to jelly, but his mood is buoyant.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttHow I look out there, Mick?

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttt(truly worried)
ttGreat, kid, great.

The ring Doctor leans over Rocky and checks the eyes.

<b>ttttDOCTOR
</b>ttOne more round -- How do you
ttfeel?

Rocky is approaching the supreme moment of his life.  He
cannot be bothered with pain or doctors.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt116.
</b>

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttFine -- Go away, I'm gonna

</b>ttYa gave it ya best shot!

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttNobody's gonna say ya didn't

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Apollo feints and Rocky falls for it.  The Champion unleashes
a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's
mouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the
ropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to
their feet.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Rocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to
come ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a
weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O.
written on every punch.  Rocky counters the assault blow for
blow.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttGimme ya best!!!!

Mickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttGimme ya best!!!

Blood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside
photographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood.

The fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit
of strength from their souls and beat each other without
mercy.  They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension
far beyond blood and pain.

</b>
<b>ttttttttt118.
</b>

Their cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters... In the
midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other
with unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched
gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives.

As though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step
towards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's
ear.

<b>ttttAPOLLO
</b>tt... Ain't gonna be no rematch.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>tt... Don't want one.

Mickey comes over and separates them and leads him back to
his corner... Mickey embraces him.

The Announcer enters the ring with a microphone.

The CROWD ROARS.

<b>ttttANNOUNCER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLadies and gentlemen -- We

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Apollo did not expect this and tenses.  His corner nervously
tries to reassure him.  It does no good.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Rocky did not expect this either and looks in confusion at
Mickey, but Mickey is frozen with anticipation.

Apollo is rigid.  Fear radiates from his eyes.  To lose the
crown on this night after the fight he fought would kill
him... A silence has blanketed the arena.

<b>ttttANNOUNCER
</b>ttJudge Conners scores it nine-
ttsix Creed... Winner and still

</b>
Rocky sorely smiles and looks at the waves of CHEERING fans
that circle the ring and reach out towards him... Mickey
grabs Rocky's hand and raises it.  The CROWD ROARS.

<b>ttttMICKEY
</b>ttI don't care what they say,
ttyou're a winner.

<b>ttttROCKY
</b>ttYo, can I have my locker back?

Mickey and Rocky look at each other and grin.  Mickey hugs
Rocky like a son.  Mickey raises Rocky's hand again.  Rocky
turns away from Mickey and pats Benny the cut-man's
shoulder... Benny smiles wearily.  Rocky stares across the
ring at Apollo Creed, who stands victorious, but his face
and body are badly distorted... The two men lock stares that
reflect admiration.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Apollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward
screaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Rocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well-
wishing fans rumble forward... Mickey's eyes show mounting
apprehension as the fans become abnormally active.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
They shove the police aside and clutch wildly at Creed.
Creed's army of bodyguards swing angrily at the crowd but
they are soon engulfed by screaming waves of humanity.
Apollo is suddenly hoisted into the air and is being carried
along by a legion of fans.
<b> 
</b>
<b>ttttttttt120.
</b>

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
On the opposite aisle Rocky is experiencing the same
overwhelming adulation by his fans but does not seem to be
frightened by it, like Apollo.  Mickey tries his best to
control things but his voice is drowned out in the growing
clamor.  The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to
their shoulders.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Rocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against
each other... chanting, 'Creed, Creed, Creed.'

Rocky's fans counter by bellowing, 'Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.'

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Paulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he
starts swinging.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Both Rocky and Apollo are completely at the mercy of the
crowd.  They are being passed overhead and remain helpless
as their bodies float up the aisle on the sea of hands...
The CHANTING IS DEAFENING.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Fearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move
forward.  Running headlong into the crowd, she angles
through the mass to get to Rocky.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
She is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions,
but she keeps her feet... She sees him.  In the distance,
Rocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall
and waits for the procession to pass.

The procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's
unbelievably battered but smiling face.  He appears to be
king of the world.

The procession approaches and passes Adrian.  She jumps on
her toes and waves frantically but is not seen.  She screams
Rocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through
the racket and reaches Rocky.

Rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages
to see Adrian jumping up and down waving.  The crowd is
carrying him away.  He attempts to lower himself but the
crowd won't permit it.

Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's
heads and shoulders.  He resembles a man trying to go up a

ttlove you...

The two are swept along into the greatest night anyone can
remember...
