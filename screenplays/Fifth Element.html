</b>
tOMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.

<b>2tEXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY
</b>
tThe mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
tOmar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.

<b>3tINT.  TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
tOmar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of
the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside
him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in
his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttt(deciphering)
tttt"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."

tHis fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>tttt"..the black hole like a door is open...
ttttEvil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..."
ttttSee?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil
tttt... make sure you get the snake!

tThe Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil,
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U.
Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist.

<b>ttttttBILLY
</b>ttttAnd when is this door opening snake act
ttttsupposed to occur?

tThe Professor's fingers touch the signs.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>tttt..if this is the five..and this the thousand..

tHe calculates.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttEvery five thousand years..

<b>ttttttBILLY
</b>ttttt(kidding)
ttttSo I have some time..

tHe reaches for the pad.

tANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water
bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttI will take it to them my son.

tStartled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttGo with God.. be safe from Evil..

tThe Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing
him.
tAs soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

tANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>tttt"..then arrange the elements of life against
ttttthe Terror just so.."

tHis fingers run on.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>tttt"..Water..fire..earth..air..four
ttttelements around the fifth.."

tHis fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by
all the others.

tThe Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into
the skin.

tANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttAziz!  Light!

tThe boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttLord forgive me.. they already know too,
ttttmuch..

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>tttt"..in which all the history of the Universe resides
tttt..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil.."

<b>ttttttPRIEST (V.O.)
</b>ttttAmen..

tThe Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup
from the skin.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttFather.. it in the most extraordinary thing..
ttttthe greatest find in history..can you imagine
ttttthe implications.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttOnly too well... here you must be
ttttparched..

tHe hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost
to his lips when..

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttI mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

tIn his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttHere the Good.. Here the Evil..

tAs the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the
water skin, drinking the leakage.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttHere..

tHe points to the Five Elements.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttA weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am
ttttgoing to be famous.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttThen let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

tThe Priest hands Billy a cup.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttDrink!

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttTo fame.. salud..

tThe Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttWe cannot toast with water.. Billy !
ttttIn my sack.. the Grappa!

tThe Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel.

<b>4tEXT.  COLONNADE - DAY
</b>
tA muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.

<b>5tINT.  TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
tBilly is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag.  He comes upon a
machine pistol.  When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention.  He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear.  Billy is
paralyzed.

<b>6tINT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe Professor keeps reading over the inscription.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>tttt"..this perfect person.. this perfect
ttttbeing.." I do not understand this.. perfect?

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttWhere is that boy? Billy!

<b>7tINT.  TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
tBilly presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but
sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him.  He
begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest's potion..

<b>8tINT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe Professor reads the wall.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttAnd this divine Light they talk
ttttabout.. what is Divine light?

tAt that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again.  The light
fails.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttt(without turning)
ttttAziz light!

tThe room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttBetter.. this is the most unbelievable thing
ttttI have ever seen..

tThe Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS.  A dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  Aziz is fast asleep.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttt(uncomprehending)
tttt...Uh, yes?

tThe Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttMaster... He was about to discover everything,
ttttbut I had the situation under control.

tThe two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttt(in a panic)
ttttWho are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen
ttttSie Deutsch?

<b>9tINT.  TUNNEL
</b>
tBilly staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.

<b>10tINT.  TEMPLE  ROOM
</b>
tThe KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttWhat did I do wrong?

tThe Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

<b>ttttttKOMMANDER
</b>ttttServant, you and the thousand guards
ttttbefore you... You have done your work well,
ttttbut we have to recover the elements. War will
ttttsoon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

tThe Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.

<b>ttttttPROFESSOR
</b>ttttUnbelievable!!!

tThe Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS
twaves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  He is followed by his men.  The Priest slips in
behind them.

<b>11tINT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
tThe Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-
shaped.  In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements.  In the middle, an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar.  The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttt(to himself)
ttttThe Fifth Element...

<b>ttttttKOMMANDER
</b>ttttTake them and put them in a safe place.

tHis men carry out his order.

<b>12tINT.  ROOM 1  TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
tBilly staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.

<b>13tINT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
tThe Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttt(moved)
ttttWill the elements be gone now forever
ttttfrom this place?

<b>ttttttKOMMANDER
</b>ttttWhen mankind comes to its senses.
ttttWe will return.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttKnowing mankind as I do, that could take
tttcenturies!

<b>ttttttKOMMANDER
</b>ttttTime is of no importance, only life
ttttis important.

tThe Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

tAngle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

tA MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the
tcase and looks at the Priest.

<b>ttttttKOMMANDER
</b>ttttWhen EVIL returns so shall we.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttt(head lowered)
ttttWe will be ready, Lord.

tBilly suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

<b>ttttttBILLY
</b>ttttStop.

tBilly trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to
close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttNo!!!  Don't!!!

tThe Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander.
The WARRIORS are in a panic.

<b>ttttttCLERK
</b>ttttHurry, Kommander!  The wall's closing!!!

tThe wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast
room fills up like an hourglass.

<b>ttttttKOMMANDER
</b>ttttA mission is a mission, Savoia.
ttttYou'll learn that.

tThe Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get
through it.  His
tarmor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and
the case through.

<b>ttttttKOMMANDER
</b>ttttMy apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..

tThe wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs
tthrough the huge piles of sand.

<b>14tEXT.  COLONNADE - DAY
</b>
tThe CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings.

<b>15tINT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried.

<b>16tEXT.  DESERT - DAY
</b>
tThe huge ship's main hatch closes.

<b>17tEXT.  TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
tThe ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.

<b>18tEXT.  PYRAMIDS
</b>
tA gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.

<b>19tEXT.  EARTH  ORBIT
</b>
tThe ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos.

<b>tWRITTEN:t500 YEARS LATER
</b>
tAnother, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.

<b>20tINT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOM
</b>
tCU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight
lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the
professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the
ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse.

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttDon't you have anything?  Not even
tttta temperature?

<b>ttttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttttThe thermo-analyzers have jammed.
ttttOne of them reads over a million degrees,
ttttthe other's at minus 5000...
ttttNever seen anything like it.

<b>ttttttTECHNICIAN
</b>ttttIt's taking shape.

<b>21tEXT.  SPACE
</b>
tIn the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color.

<b>ttttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttttt(in awe)
ttttWhat the hell can it be?

<b>ttttttTECHNICIAN
</b>ttttHook-up with the president in one
ttttminute, General.

tGeneral Staedert remains calm.

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>tttt...Send out a probe.

<b>22tINT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE  MANHATTAN
</b>
tLINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined
and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office.
There's a crisis in the air.  The President's AIDE leans down to his ear.

<b>ttttttAIDE
</b>ttttOn air in 30 seconds.

tIn the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of
Egypt.  A younger man DAVID, 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old
man.

<b>23tINT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE
</b>
<b>ttttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttttPresident on line sir..

tGeneral Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT (O.S.)
</b>ttttStaedert, do you read me?

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttI can hear you, Mr. President, but I
ttttcan't see you .

tThe President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
tHis face fills the screen.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttt(exasperated)
ttttIs that better?

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttPerfect, Mr. President.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttI have to address the Supreme Council
ttttin 10 minutes.
ttttJust the facts, General.

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttThere are no results from the chemical
ttttand molecular analysis as of yet, all the
ttttcalibers are overshot..we're hoping a
ttttthermo nucleatic imaging..

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>tttt(exasperated)
ttttWhat you are saying is you don't know
ttttwhat this..thing..is.

tConsternation reigns in the President's office.

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttNot yet Sir..The only thing we know is
ttttit just keeps getting bigger!

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttOptions.

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttWait or act.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttRecommendations.

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttMy philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
ttttask questions later.
ttttI don't like uninvited guests.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttGentlemen?

<b>ttttttHEAD CHEMISTS
</b>ttttI think it would be foolish to shoot at an
ttttorganism that seems alive, without first
tttttaking the time to study it more!
ttttBesides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttt(worried)
ttttNo... it's just getting bigger.

<b>ttttttHEAD CHEMISTS
</b>ttttSo do people, but that's no reason to shoot
ttttthem.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttt(exasperated)
ttttThe security of the Federated Territories is
ttttand remains number one priority.
ttttt(to the military)
ttttI suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is
ttttacceptable to you?

tAll the Generals nod "yes"

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttAll right, then! Staedert?

<b>ttttttPRIEST (O.S.)
</b>ttttMr. President?

tThe President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>tttt...Yes?

tThe camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
tAround his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.

<b>ttttttPRIEST
</b>ttttCornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.
ttttI have a different theory to offer you,
ttttMr. President.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttI'm listening.

<b>ttttttCORNELIUS
</b>ttttImagine for a moment that this. thing is not
ttttanything that can be identified because it prefers
ttttnot to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
ttttBecause it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttt(a little sarcastically)
ttttOne more reason to shoot first eh?

tAll the Generals nod in agreement.

<b>ttttttCORNELIUS
</b>ttttEvil begets evil, Mr. President.
ttttShooting would only make it stronger.

<b>24tINT.  SPACESHIP
</b>
<b>ttttttTECHNICIAN
</b>ttttThe probe will attain its objective in
ttttfive seconds.

tStaedert moves closer to the ship's window.

<b>25tEXT.  SPACE.
</b>
tEvil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a
furious volcano.

<b>26tINT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE
</b>
<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttMr. President, we're at crisis point.

tThe President looks puzzled.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttYour theory is interesting Father but
ttttI don't think we have time to go into it
ttttright now!

<b>ttttttCORNELIUS
</b>ttttTime is of no importance, Mr. President.
ttttOnly life is important.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttt(exasperated)
ttttThat's exactly what we are going to try and do:
ttttProtect the lives of some 200 billion of our
ttttfellow citizens! General?
ttttYou may fire when ready.

tttt..Up front loading of a 120 ZZR missile.
ttttMarker lights on the objective.

<b>28tEXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP
</b>
tAll of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases.
A black crust immediately covers it.

<b>29tINT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE
</b>
<b>ttttttSCIENTIST
</b>ttttt(consulting new data)
ttttIts structure has just solidified on the surface,
tttt as if the object felt something.  If that's the case,
ttttwe are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.

<b>ttttttCORNELIUS
</b>ttttThe most terrible intelligence imaginable,
ttttMr. President.

tThe President hesitates.

<b>ttttttCAPTAIN
</b>tttt...The ship is in combat formation.
ttttThe missile is loaded, General.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttt(uneasy)
ttttStaedert?  Give me a minute...
ttttI have a doubt.

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttt(cold)
ttttI don't, Mr. President.

<b>30tEXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP
</b>
tThe missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The
explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water.
Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger.

<b>31tINT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE
</b>
tStaedert looks worried.

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttLoad a series of 740 missiles. Maximum
ttttshield protection.

<b>ttttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttttYes, Sir.

tThe President is growing ever more worried.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttStaedert?  What's going on?  Did you
ttttdestroy it?

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttI'm about to, Mr. President.

<b>32tEXT.  SPACESHIP
</b>
tA series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.
And literally doubles in size.

<b>ttttttSCIENTIST
</b>ttttThe planet's diameter has greatly
ttttincreased and it's moving toward the ship.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttStaedert?  Get out of there immediately!
ttttI don't want an incident, do you hear me,
ttttStaedert?

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttt(worried)
tttt...What do we have that's bigger than 240?

<b>ttttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttttNothing, General.

<b>ttttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttttStaedert, get out of there!  That's an order!

tA bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert's spaceship.

<b>ttttttSTAEDERT
</b>ttttt(eyes wide)
tttt... Good God!

tThe flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that....

<b>33tINT.  APARTMENT

t... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs
his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,
unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there.
The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It
in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a
light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it
tstill rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttt(to the cat)
ttttI'm coming.

tHe grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet
wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the
bed makes itself automatically.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttt(on the phone)
ttttYeah?

<b>ttttttFINGER (V.O.)
</b>ttttHey bud! Finger here.

tHe opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for
a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>
ttttt(to the cat)
ttttHi sweetie!

t...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas

<b>ttttttFINGER (V.O.)
</b>ttttI love you too Major, but you haven't called

t...A picture of Korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttAt least, the cat comes back.

<b>ttttttFINGER (V.O.)
</b>ttttt(ironical)
ttttYou still pining for that two timing bitch.
ttttForget her.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttI just found a picture of you.

<b>ttttttFINGER (V.O.)
</b>ttttHow do I look?

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttLike shit.

tKorben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It
does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
GEMINI croquettes.
tOn the packet is an ad:
<b>tWIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE.
</b>
<b>ttttttFINGER (V.O.)
</b>tttt Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta bring
ttttme your hack for the 6 month overhaul.  A.S.A.P.

tKorben heats up some brackish water.

ttttI don't need one.

<b>ttttttFINGER (V.O.)

ttttUh... at least fifty.

<b>ttttttFINGER (V.O.)
</b>ttttIn your dreams! See you tonight!

tFinger has hang up.  Korben sighs and does the same.  He gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  The cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  Korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup.

tThe cat meows.  Korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer.

tThe office is emptied, only a few army officers remain.  An ancient

ttttThe Mondoshawans don't belong to the

ttttin their possession are the four elements of life.
ttttThese elements when they are gathered around a fifth:

ttttlife......

tThe SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the
bottom half of his body.  Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones.

ttttwhich is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

advice.

<b>ttttttMUGGER
</b>ttttThanks..

<b>ttttttKORBEN

tAs the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is
full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers
to his feet and runs off.

tKorben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches

<b>ttttttMACTILBURGH
</b>ttttActually only one cell survived..

ttttAlmost like it was...engineered.

</b>ttttSounds like a freak of nature to me.

<b>ttttttMACTILBURGH
</b>ttttYes... I can't wait to meet him.

tThey pass into the lab.

<b>53tINT.  LABORATORY
</b>
tThe two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in
the middle with the metal glove inside.  A DNA chain scrolls on the computer
screen.

<b>ttttttMACTILBURGH
</b>ttttt(rather fascinated)
ttttThe compositional elements of his DNA
ttttchain are the same as ours, there are simply
ttttmore of them tightly packed.
ttttHis knowledge is probably limitless..

<b>ttttttMUNRO
</b>ttttt(worried)
ttttIs there any danger? Some kind of virus?

<b>ttttttMACTILBURGH
</b>ttttWe put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
ttttThe cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

tMunro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to
open the
tself-destruct box.

<b>ttttttMUNRO
</b>ttttOK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...
ttttotherwise I turn him into cat food.

tMactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the
sell-destruct button, ready to use it.  Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.

<b>ttttttDOCTOR
</b>ttttThree seconds to ultra-violet protection.

tA shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.

<b>ttttttMACTILBURGH
</b>ttttt(to Munro)
tttt...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction
ttttof pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly
ttttgreasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
ttttto react, to protect themselves.
ttttThat means growing skin. Clever, eh?

ttttWonderful!

tThe meter slows, drops to zero.

tA whoosh of air in the glass chamber.  Captain Munro has his hand on the
self-destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been
reborn.

<b>ttttttMACTILBURGH

tAn electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside
to jerk.
tAfter a few moments of silence, the SOUND of a heartbeat fills the room
over the loudspeaker.

<b>ttttttASSISTANT
</b>ttttLife support system activated.

tThe Supreme Being is alive once again.

<b>ttttttMACTILBURGH
</b>ttttRemove the shield.

tThe ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly
reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful.  Munro stands there
gaping.  Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being.  Mactilburgh glances
at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct button.

<b>ttttttMACTILBURGH
</b>ttttt(with a smile)
ttttI told you ... perfect!

tMunro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty.

<b>ttttttMUNRO
</b>tttt...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives
ttttbefore she wakes up.

tMactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches
the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and
screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding.

ttttActivate the phonic detector.

tThe girl kicks the window repeatedly.

<b>ttttttMACTILBURGH
</b>ttttAnd give her a light sedative...
ttttand something to wear!

tThe ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor
in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly.
Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with
undisguised pleasure.

<b>ttttttMUNRO
</b>ttttt(to Mactilburgh)
ttttThis thing solid?

<b>ttttttMACTILBURGH
</b>ttttt(smiling)
ttttAn elephant couldn't crack it.

tMunro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.

<b>ttttttMUNRO
</b>ttttt(with a smile)
ttttYou're gonna have to learn to communicate
ttttbetter than that angel if you want out.

tMunro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams
her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The
chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The
girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps
out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her.
She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He
sets off a general alarm.

<b>54tINT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY
</b>
tThe girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad
of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The
girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air
shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it.

tShe has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has
become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run
vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.

<b>ttttttCHIEF

ttttGo on follow her!

tThe COPS stare into the gaping void.

<b>ttttttCOP
</b>tttt...No way.

tThe CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.

<b>ttttttVOICE (O.S.)

off.

tKorben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive
and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown.

tThe police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns
point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
tKorben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

tHer POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an
orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots
to Korben a look of pure distress.

tKorben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.

tThe police car takes out after him, sirens screeching.  An insane chase
ensues.

tCornelius runs into the next room.  Korben looks at the girl, goes to

Her skin seems so soft, so fragile.

on a plate as the Thai serves it to him proudly.

</b>ttttStewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..

tKorben forces a weak, polite smile as the Thai looks on expectantly.  The
phone rings.

the match box.
tKorben strikes one and it fizzles.

</b>ttttYou wouldn't even eat one to help your

</b>ttttt(resigned)

tKorben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding.

</b>ttttt(to the Thai)

The Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window.

tKorben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the
door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a
Captain and a Major.
tMAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.
tMunro opens a file.

</b>ttttAnd the third one?

tHe whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying
about,

tEveryone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic
voice.

code on the police wall box.  A device descends from the ceiling, a
flashing light-siren,
ta VOICE fills the air.

<b>ttttttVOICE
</b>ttttThis is not an exercise.
ttttThis is a police control.

tCornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge.

<b>ttttttCORNELIUS
</b>ttttOh my god oh my god..

tKorben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower
takes it's place.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttLeeloo, hide in here and don't move!

tLeeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed.

tKorben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He's

and beard.

tC.U. Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the
neighbor's apartment.  COP 3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor's door.
The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall, COP 1
arrives with Korben's picture.

<b>ttttttCOP 1
</b>ttttSir, this is a control.  Please put your

tKorben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth
chattering from the cold.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttI'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.

His eyes fall on an old blanket.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttHere let me wrap you up.

tKorben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttt..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and
tttyou've ended up in my arms both times.

tLeeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.

<b>ttttttLEELOO
</b>ttttt(nicely)
ttttValo massa... Chacha hamas.

<b>ttttttKORBEN

tThe intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion.

</b>ttttCoffee!  That's what you need!
ttttA nice, hot cup of coffee!

tHe pushes a button on the coffee machine.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttWith some honey!  You'll see, honey's
ttttgreat!...

tKorben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to
quite understand everything that is going on.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttA hot cup of coffee... with honey...

tHe rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and
begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon..

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttt(nervously)
ttttI've got this great honey somewhere.
ttttYou know about honey?  There used to be
ttttthese little animals who made it with antenna...

t..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>tttt..and these other animals who ate it..

tShe looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttI forget which ate it and which made it
ttttbut..

tAnd she smiles.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttHere it is!

tKorben holds up the jar of honey.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttTaste this...

tLeeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttIt... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

tShe savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

tAn indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttYou hear that?

<b>ttttttLEELOO
</b>ttttt(licking)
ttttCornelius..

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttOh god!

tKorben pushes the button on the wall.  The bed pops out, fully made, with
Cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttI'm really sorry.. let me help you..

Korben begins to pull at the covers when..

<b>ttttttLEELOO
</b>ttttAchta ge lumitai de matala..

tKorben turns..

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttWhat?

tHe turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. His breath is taken
away by the sight of her perfect body.

tCornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  Korben drops to
the floor.

<b>ttttttLEELOO

tThe POLICE exit the elevator and head for the front door.  A cop suddenly
takes a hit from a silencer, then a second. Others are bashed on the head

into a small shed.

tHe closes the door.

<b>120tINT. AIRPORT  HALL - DAY

tCornelius and Leeloo (still damp) arrive at the Manhattan Intergalactic
Airport.
tA huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

tThere are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash
holding picket signs.  A SECURITY GUARD picks up a phone off the wall.

</b>ttttIllegal gathering in Zone 4.

tA hand taps Leeloo from behind.  She whips around catching David in the
face.

<b>ttttttCORNELIUS

tHe turns to David who in holding his bloody nose.

<b>ttttttCORNELIUS
</b>ttttDid you get them?

tDavid hands Cornelius two passports.

<b>ttttttCORNELIUS
</b>ttttExcellent... Leeloo Dallas.

</b>ttttHe'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva...

ttttGod be with you.

tANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he
scopes the hall looking for Leeloo. A POLICE PATROL bearing down on the
STRIKERS jostles him. The cops open fire.  The strikers dive into the garbage
and disappear.

tDavid gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes.

tBack a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for
them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's
seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back.

isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared.

tCornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot,

kiss on his lips in welcome.

<b>ttttttHOSTESS

ttttWelcome to Paradise.

tKorben's face is covered in lipstick.  Leeloo sees he did nothing to stop
the girl and she doesn't like it.

tA HEFTY MAN wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck.  Then,
tobviously relishing it, he leans down to kiss her.  Leeloo bashes him on
the forehead.  The hefty man straightens up.  He's still smiling, but his
nose is bleeding. He falls slowly to the floor.

tKorben pushes forward trying to spot Leeloo.  He also tries to wipe the
lipstick off.  Leeloo tries to escape through a door marked PERSONNEL ONLY,
but it's locked.  A HOST looks at her with a grin.

as if nothing were amiss.

tA shriek of joy fills the room.  Korben turns around.  The HOSTESSES
cluster around Loc Rhod as he comes out of the plane.  Loc Rhod spots Korben
and latches onto his arm.  It's not going to be easy to remain discrete.

tKorben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in

ttttHere's some champagne. I'll drop by after

tShe gives him a blinding smile and closes the door.

tKorben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular
view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity.
Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of
his reverie.

tLeeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear
the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of
tPORTERS carrying trunks.

tNot wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a
painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face
of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and
strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy.
The Diva's ASSISTANT comes up to her.

<b>ttttttDIVA'S ASSISTANT
</b>ttttPlease forgive this little incident. She wants
ttttyou to know that she senses great powers in
ttttyou... in the service of a noble cause... She

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttListen, Ma! I've only got a few days

tThe door RINGS.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>tttt...Hang on, it's the door. No!
ttttI told you I didn't bring anybody!
ttttI'm all alone... as usual!

tKorben opens the door.  It's not the champagne.  Even better. It's
Leeloo.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttt(to his mother)
tttt...I'll call you back.

tLeeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  Korben has to
turn away once more.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttHere we go again...

<b>ttttttLEELOO
</b>ttttt(by rote)
ttttYou know women normally change five
tttttimes more than men.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttYou get that off the screen?

<b>ttttttLEELOO
</b>ttttYes... you know there's a lot of
ttttdifferences between men women.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttYou noticed..

<b>ttttttLEELOO
</b>ttttOK, you can turn around!

tKorben turns around.  Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy
to the max.  He is smitten.  So much so that Leeloo wonders if something
isn't quite right.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttWhere you going?

<b>ttttttLEELOO
</b>ttttI'm going to see the Diva sing. What's
ttttthe matter?... Do I look bad?

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttNo, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite,
ttttyou're... you're beautiful!

tLeeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  She turns, revealing
her unzippered back.  Korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh.  Her
perfect bottom.

<b>ttttttLEELOO
</b>ttttDo you know how this works?

tKorben's blood boils.  She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to
the zipper.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttI have an idea.

tBut instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  A
flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going
from the floor to the ceiling.
tStunned, Leeloo is held captive.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttI told you I need to work in peace.
ttttRemember? I need to concentrate.

<b>ttttttLEELOO
</b>ttttAnd you can't concentrate with me
ttttaround?.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttIt's difficult.

tShe tries to breakout.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttArmy issue. I'm sorry.

tLeeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. Impossible.

tKorben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.
tLeeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.

tThe door flies open.  Loc Rhod barges in.

tThen he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  His mind goes
to the obvious.

</b>ttttKorben my man what's happening here?
ttttWho's the chick? What's the gig?

tttt"I love to sing, too, but in the shower", she

tA waiter gives them two glasses of champagne.  Track with the WAITER an
he leaves the hall with his empty tray.  He enters a small room reserved for
staff.

tThe waiter joins some other WAITERS.  They are well armed.  He opens a

tLeeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert.

<b>181tINT.  CONCERT  HALL
</b>
tKorben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown,
stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  Behind her, a star filled
window.  The MUSIC begins.  The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien.
And then she begins to sing.  Her voice is divine, unmatched.  Korben is
swept up in the TEARS.

<b>182tINT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

tLeeloo has tears in her eyes

tThe manager couldn't care less about the concert.  His main problem is
the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open.  The doorbell RINGS.

</b>ttttFlowers for the Diva.

<b>ttttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttttThere's champagne as well...

tThe manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. A dozen Mangalores rush
in. One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall.

the beginning of our story.

<b>188tINT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

tLeeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam
with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough
for her to escape.

<b>189tINT.  CLOSET  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

finds a case engraved with the four elements.

</b>
tA WARRIOR whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes Leeloo.  She
disarms him gracefully.  A violent fight breaks out.  The Diva sings and
Leeloo dances.  The Mangalores pay a heavy price for the show.

<b>193tINT.  CORRIDOR
</b>
tHearing noise from inside the suite, the Mangalore by the door gets
nervous.  He runs for reinforcements.

<b>194tINT.  POLICE  STATION

tCornelius enters the police station wearing handcuffs.  The Chief of
Police is behind him holding a gun.

<b>195tINT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL

tLeeloo knocks out the last Mangalore just as the Diva finishes her song
to a burst of applause.  The Diva takes a bow.   So does Leeloo.

tAkanit and his men listen to the concert. The Mangalore guard runs in.

tttt...And thanks for doing all the dirty work!
ttttI couldn't have done it any better myself!
ttttt(sharply)

tLeeloo smiles and hands him the case.  Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready
to kill her.

<b>ttttttZORG
</b>ttttNice knowing you.

tLeeloo catches on quickly.  She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into
the gun which throws Zorg's shot off.  She jumps to the ceiling and
disappears in an air vent.  Furious, Zorg fires at the ceiling.

tLeeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

tZorg fires his 3000 round clip.  The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss
cheese.  Zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on.  The

seconds.

bullets.  A dozen Mangalores attack the police office.  Akanit is at
their head.  The policemen are caught unaware.

<b>ttttttAKANIT
</b>ttttNobody move! We're taking over this

his time.

tMore Mangalores rush in from all around shooting.  Two cops are killed.
tThe Diva... takes a bullet.

tShe falls from the stage into Korben's arms. He lowers her to the floor.
Korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket,
trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds.

nearby, still on the air.

tHe cannot believe his eyes.  He goes berserk, destroying everything in

</b>ttttI'm sorry, but... the Stones...

ttttThey are... with me...

tThe Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.  Korben frisks the
Diva but doesn't find anything.  The shooting slowly stops in the theatre.
The Mangalores are now in total control.

tHe touches the Diva's stomach and senses something hard.  Girding
himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a Sacred Stone.
Then another.  And another.  Korben pulls out all four Stones, covered in blue
blood.  Everyone has left the theater.  The Mangalores check the aisles one
by one.

tLoc Rhod peeks out from under a seat.

tA Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva.  He grabs Korben by
the shoulder and pokes him with his gun.

tKorben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  Just for

and snatches the gun.

tKorben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands.

</b>ttttNo. It's much simpler. If we don't figure
ttttout where these Stones go in five minutes,
ttttwe're all dead! Think you got it?

tLoc Rhod's got it and runs over to put in his Stone.  The four Stones are
all in place but nothing happens.

ttttsupposed to be four beams of light.

<b>ttttttCORNELIUS

ttttYes, of course, but... The Stones are shut!
ttttThey have to be open for it to work.

tKorben is desperate.  Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out
of her.
tHe darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttThe rain falls... the wind blows?

tLoc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttTry and figure out how this fucking thing

tLoc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around.

Loc Rhod is discouraged.

<b>ttttttLOC RHOD
</b>tttt...we'll never make it.

tHe sighs.  Three hooks pop off the Stone.  Loc Rhod can't believe his
eyes.

<b>ttttttLOC RHOD
</b>ttttIt... it moved! Korben! Korben!

tKorben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttWhat did you say? What did you do?

<b>ttttttLOC RHOD
</b>ttttNothing! Swear to God, I didn't do
ttttnothing!

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttLook, you did something that set it off.
ttttTry to remember. Concentrate. Tell me

tLoc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement.

<b>ttttttLOC RHOD
</b>ttttI was like this... With my hands here and...
ttttI said, "We'll never make it!" That's all!

tNothing happens.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttIs that all?

<b>ttttttLOC RHOD
</b>ttttYeah... then I sighed... like this.

tLoc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more.
tKorben's got it.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttThe wind! The wind blows...

tKorben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttQuickly, everyone on a Stone!
ttttWater for water!  Fire for fire!
ttttEarth for earth!

tThe two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears.

tLoc Rhod has a problem.

<b>ttttttLOC RHOD
</b>ttttt(shaking)
ttttI don't have a light.  I stopped smoking
ttttlast week! If we'd come a bit sooner...

tKorben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only
one left.

<b>ttttttKORBEN
</b>ttttDon't breathe.

tLoc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A
small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben
feels like he's got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone.
The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch
of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.

crisscross.

ttttthis time, for as long as you want.
ttttCome on! You can do it!

tKorben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.
tLeeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
tAn indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

<b>ttttttCORNELIUS
</b>ttttCome on Leeloo! Come on!

tThe beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor.

tThe heat in the temple is unbearable.  All the walls start to ooze the
same horrible black slimy liquid seen at Zorg's.  A drop of liquid falls to
the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  Loc
Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  Korben quickly straightens
Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.

</b>ttttLeeloo! If you don't get on with the

t- Korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he's never kissed
anybody before.  - The white beam, the Divine Light, immediately forms
around Leeloo and Korben. - The stopwatch hits zero.  - The Absolute Beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down.  - Korben and Leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow.

t- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet.  Inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet.  Screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying.

t- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites.

tIn the temple, the beam loses its intensity.  But Leeloo and Korben
remain stuck together, lost in their kiss.  Cornelius has dropped to his
knees, clutching his hands.

tLoc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh.  He gives Cornelius a knowing
smile.

tMactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him
to see what is going on under the blue shield.

probably engaged in hoppi hoppa.
