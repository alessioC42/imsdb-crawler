<pre>

<b>EXT. TRAIN - DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN
</b>
Suburban Connecticut, outside of New York City, 1973. The
still after a terrible storm. Trees dripping, their branches
torn, the air warming just before the break of a new day. The
train lies dark and motionless, a few flashing yellow
emergency lights up front, as a work crew removes debris from
the track.

<b>INT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN
</b>
Various passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep.

On Paul Hood, 15-and-a-half, stoner-preppie look, hunched up
in his seat under the faint emergency exit light. He reads
his Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the
emergency exit sign.

Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the
train's engines returns.

The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic
nasal voice.

<b>tttCONDUCTOR 
</b>tGood morning ladies and gentlemen --

He sounds like a baseball announcer.

<b>tttPASSENGERS
</b>tt(mumbling, ad lib)
tWhat ladies?

<b>tttCONDUCTOR 
</b>t-- this train originating at New
tYork's Grand Central Station is
tback in service - next stop will be
tNew Canaan, Connecticut. New
tCanaan, Connecticut, next stop!

He moves on to the next car.

The train begins to move.

Paul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the
still-dark early morning.

He looks back down at his comic book.

On the comic book: Reed Richards (also known as Stretch) has
zapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the
destructive energy that Annihilus has implanted in him. 

The Thing, Medusa, Flame, and Richards' wife Sue Storm look
on, stunned.
<b>t"THEN YOU'VE TURNED HIM INTO A
</b><b>tVEGETABLE. YOUR OWN SON." "DON'T
</b><b>tYOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO
</b><b>tPOWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD
</b><b>tCONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE
</b><b>tDESTROYED THE WQRLD!"
</b>
Paul looks up again, thinking.

<b>tttPAUL (V.O.)
</b>tIn issue number 141 of The
tFantastic Four, published in
tNovember 1973, Reed Richards has to
tuse his anti-matter weapon on his
town son, who Annihilus has turned
tinto a human atom bomb. His son is
tthe result of Richards' coupling
twith the earthling Sue Storm, and
tthe problem is that the cosmic rays
tthat infused Richards and the rest
tof the Fantastic Four on their
taborted moon mission have made
tyoung Franklin a volatile mixture
tof matter and anti-matter.

<b>EXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN
</b>
The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested
landscape.

<b>tttPAUL (V.O.)
</b>tAnd that's what it is to come from
ta family, if you analyze it
tclosely. Each of them is negative
tmatter for the other ones. And
tthat's what dying is -- dying is
twhen your family, which is in fact
tyour personal negative matter from
twhich you emerge -- it's when the
tfamily takes you back, thus hurling
tyou back into negative space...

<b>INT. TRAIN. CONT'D.
</b>
On Paul, as the sun breaks over the horizon. His face glows
warmly in the yellow light. He looks down idly at the comic
book.

<b>tttPAUL (V.O.)
</b>tSo it's a paradox -- the closer
tyou're drawn back in, the further
tinto the void you're thrown.

<b>EXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING
</b>
The train slowly pulls in.

The train doors open, and Paul, weary from the long night,
emerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the
platform -- Ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining
traces of his boyish looks; Elena, 37, distant and elegant
even in her oversized sweater; and Wendy, 14, a sullen
suburban Lolita.

He pauses, regarding them.

They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.

<b>EXT. ST. PETER'S SCHOOL. MORNING
</b>
To establish. A typical New England prep school.

<b>INT. PAUL AND FRANCIS'S DORM ROOM. MORNING
</b>
Cramped, a mess, but quaint. Paul shares the room with
Francis Davenport IV, a dissolute, smart-ass son of money.

Paul's alarm clock rings. He slams his hand down on it and
jumps out of bed, fully clothed in his rumpled preppie
uniform of frayed khakis, loose tie, shirt with one tail
untucked in, etc. Across the room, Francis beckons from his
desk, as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong.

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tArise and shine, young Hood.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tI hope you changed the water in
tthat bong from last night.

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tt(finishing a hit)
tThe water, as you call it, is a
tspecial mixture of amaretto and
tBen&Ben blended for just the exact
tchemical interaction with the last
tof our precious Thai stick.

Paul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit. He coughs,
spewing uninhaled smoke.

<b>tttFRANCIS (CONT'D)
</b>tWaste not Master Hood -- that was
t$20 for the bag.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tt(gathering books, papers,
tt almost talking to
tt himself)
tMan, Francis, you are one drug
taddled elitist freak, and when the
trevolution comes I do not want to
tbe lined up with you and shot,
t'cause you're fucking ripe for
tpolitical reeducation, you know,
tlike in the fields.

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tPaul, cancel your mental
tappointments, baby. What are you,
tlike still stoned from last night?

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tt(spraying some chloroform
tt mouth spray)
tI gotta get to English class.

<b>INT. ST PETERS' CLASSROOM. DAY
</b>
An English class in progress.

Paul Hood sits blankly, hardly listening, until he hears the
teacher call out.

<b>tttTEACHER 
</b>tLibbets?

<b>tttLIBBETS 
</b>tWhat Dostoyevsky is saying here is
tthat to be a Christian is to
tchoose, because you have to choose
tof your own choice, but since you
tcan't choose to be good because
tthat would be too rational you have
tto choose to be bad -- it's
texistential.

<b>tttTEACHER 
</b>tThank you Libbets, that's a very
tcompelling summary, but --

Paul looks at her, smitten. Marge, Paul's friend, notices his
look.

<b>INT. ST. PETER'S HALLWAY. DAY
</b>
As class lets out, Paul accosts Libbets.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tUm, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm
talso really a fan, and what you
twere saying, you know, have you
tever read The Idiot?

<b>tttLIBBETS 
</b>tThe Idiot?

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tIf you liked Notes from
tUnderground, you'll love The Idiot.

<b>tttLIBBETS
</b>tt(turning to go)
tGreat, thanks for the tip.

<b>tttPAUL
</b>tt(after her)
tThe Idiot.

<b>INT. ST. PETER'S HALLWAY. DAY
</b>
Paul walks with Marge.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tI'm in love with Libbets Casey.

<b>tttMARGE 
</b>tYeah, well, you've been in love
twith like every other girl here, I
twas wondering when you'd get around
tto Libbets.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tIt's beyond mere physical
tattraction.

<b>tttMARGE 
</b>tThat's good, because I don't think
tLibbets is capable of the sex act.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tTruly? Do speak.

<b>tttMARGE 
</b>tMy diagnosis is messed in the head.
tA poor little rich girl -- I mean
tcheck out the jeans and fur look.
tAnd lend your ears to this
tbrutality. Like her mom and step
tdad and her step-sisters are going
tto Switzerland to ski over
tThanksgiving break -- and like they
tdidn't invite her!

<b>tttPAUL
</b>tHow do you know this shit?

<b>tttMARGE 
</b>tThey did it last year too. It's
tlike traditional or something.
tThey've got this humongoid Park Ave
tapartment and she just holes up
tthere with a wad of cash. 
tt(beat)
tAren't the hugely wealthy sad?

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tt(pause)
tYou think Francis is going to beat
tme to the punch here?

<b>tttMARGE 
</b>tSince he sleeps with every girl you
tever show an interest in, why don't
tyou just keep your Libbets thing a
tsecret from him?

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tGood thinking Marge.

<b>INT. SCHOOL PARTY. NIGHT
</b>
Paul, Francis and friends enter the dark, crowded room.
Various kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm
style undanceable rock (Jethro Tull, etc.) Francis hands Paul
the tail end of a joint, but Paul waves it away.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tNo more man. I'm about to drop as
tit is.

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tSee ya.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tWhere you going?

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tPaul, let me enlighten you about
tsomething.
tYou and I exist on two opposite
tsides of a great existential
tdivide, that being your pathetic
tvirginity on the one hand and my
tastonishing number of sexual
tconquests on the other. I'm off to
tget laid. See you.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tFlame on, asshole.

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tAnd remember, with your erogenous
tzones lubricated as such with the
tmighty herb, do not attempt
tterrestrial contact with members of
tthe opposite sex -- because you
tdrone on like a motherfucker when
tyou're stoned.

He waves his fingers toward Paul's eyes, in the classic
"stoned" gesture, then wanders off.

Paul looks on at the gathering. Marge waves to him from the
dance floor.

<b>ttttttLATER:
</b>
<b>INT. SCHOOL PARTY. CONT'D
</b>
Paul wanders, stoned, through the party. He sees Libbets from
across the room. She seems to be surrounded by friends.

<b>INT. PARTY. CONT'D
</b>
Paul has cornered Libbets and is talking over the music.
There are just a few people left, most of them making out
with each other.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tt(stoned)
t-- because I've been reading
tKerouac and Ginsberg and those guys
twere creating beat culture and
ttraveling and sleeping wherever,
tand, of course, with all kinds of
tpeople, but when you read carefully
tthe various contemporary accounts
tof their lives, and, uh, these guys
tdidn't bathe much, I mean they were
treally filthy, with like genital
tcrabs, lice, exceptionally strong
tbody odor...

Libbets smiles through her yawn.

<b>EXT. SCHOOL BENCH. NIGHT
</b>
Paul sits alone on the bench, freezing cold, eating a donut.
Some kids from across the lawn yell good-night to him.

<b>INT. DORM ROOM. EVENING.
</b>
Paul is at his desk. Francis enters, wrapped in a towel,
fresh from the shower.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tHow can you do that man?

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tDo what?

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tSleep all day. I mean, look, it's
talready getting dark outside, and
tyou're just getting up.

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tt(beat)
tUm, Libbets Casey.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tWhat?

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tAha! I could sense the vibe.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tWhat do you mean?

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tAm I right or am I right?

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tShit. You're not planning --

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tMy man, I speak to you solely as a
tcomrade in arms offering
tunconditional aid. I've been giving
tthis one a lot of thought, and I
tbelieve that the two of you
ttogether might just reach that
thigher ground that --

A knock at the door.

<b>tttSTUDENT  (O.S.)
</b>tHood, telephone.

Paul rolls off his bed, opens the door.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tDon't mess with Libbets. I mean it!

<b>INT. DORM HALLWAY. NIGHT
</b>
Paul walks to the pay phone at the end of the hall.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tHello?

<b>INTERCUT - HOOD HOUSEHOLD. NIGHT
</b>
It's a modern (shag carpet, geometric-patterned wallpaper,
etc.) suburban house.

Ben Hood talks on the phone, a drink in his hand.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tPaul?

In the background, we can see Wendy watching Richard Nixon on
<b>TV.
</b>
<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tHi dad.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tHey guy. Things ok up there? You
tall right?

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tI'm fine dad.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWell good. Just confirming. You'll
tbe on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tWell dad, actually I thought I'd
ttake the morning train on
tThanksgiving -- got a lot of
tstudying, papers, you know, lab
texperiments --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tLab experiments? Right smart guy --
tPaul, you know your mother's gonna
tbe disappointed not to see more of
tyou -- In fact, let me make this
tmore than a simple request guy, I
tthink you should...

<b>IN THE BACKGROUND:
</b>
<b>tttNIXON
</b>tt(on TV, from San Clemente
tt press conference) 
tWell, with regard to the questions
tas to why Americans feel we were
twrong to make the tapes, that is
tnot particularly surprising. I
tthink that most Americans do not
tlike the idea of taping
tconversations and, frankly, it is
tnot something that particularly
tappeals to me...

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tHold on for a second.
tt(turning)
tWendy, you want-to say hi to your
tbrother?

She frowns.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tCome on!

She gets up sullenly and goes to the phone.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tCharles.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tCharles. Have you been keeping out
tof my shit? Have you refrained from
tentering the sacred precincts of my
troom?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tI have not touched your sh--
tt(looks at father)
tStuff. You watching this?

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tWatching what?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tNixon, doofus! It's incredible. He
tshould be shot.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tt(overhearing)
tHey, that's the president of the
tgoddam United States you're talking
tabout, Wendy!

From the kitchen, Elena overhears. She's dressed to go out,
but in the process of making a Kraft macaroni and cheese
dinner for Wendy.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tHe's a liar!
tt(still talking more to her
tt father than into the
tt phone)
tDean told him on March 21st about
tKalmback and Hunt, all about the
tpayoffs to the Watergate burglars,
tso you tell me where the so-called
t"Dean Report" is, but you can't
tbecause it doesn't exist, because
the lied about Haldeman and
tErlichman and the April 17 tape,
tthat's why! Liar!

Ben retreats, going to the wet bar to pour another drink.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tt(muttering)
tOK, OK, the defense rests.
tt(to Elena in the kitchen)
tWant another?

<b>tttELENA (O.S.)
</b>tNo thank you. We should be off.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tGotcha.

He puts the bottle back down without pouring.

<b>INTERCUT BACK TO PAUL:
</b>
<b>tttPAUL
</b>tt(on the phone)
tHey Charles. Charles, calm down --
tI wasn't in on it.

Elena, putting on her coat, comes into the den and gives
Wendy a kiss on the forehead as Wendy mumbles her good-byes
to Paul on the phone.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tDinner's on the counter. We'll be
tat the Williams's -- you know the
tnumber. 
tt(takes the phone from
tt Wendy)
tPaul. Hi. Is there anything you'll
twant, any particular kind of food
tor snack or anything we can stock
tup on?... You're all right? ... OK.
tSee you next week. I love you.

Back to Nixon on the TV.

<b>tttNIXON 
</b>tWe must recognize that one excess
tbegets another, and that the
textremes of violence in the 1960s
tcontributed to the extremes of
tWatergate...

On Wendy as she regards the TV, hearing her parents'
farewells as they leave through the front door.

<b>EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. NIGHT
</b>
A large New England Colonial, with a few modern additions and
touches. We hear the sound of dinner chatter.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS DINING ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
The kitchen door swings open into the dining room, and Mikey
and Sandy Williams emerge, each holding platters of food.
Mikey, 15-and-a-half, lost in space, and Sandy, 14, a sullen
and barely pubescent boy, each have towels draped over their
forearms -- they are the evening's "waiters".

They move unsteadily to the table, at which sit their parents
Janey (38, a hard-edged, sharp-witted beauty) and Jim (43,
large and a bit goofy, a genius inventor), together with
their guests, Ben and Elena Hood, and neighbors Dorothy and
Ted Franklin.

We jump cut through the evening's conversations, seen mostly
from the furtive POV's of the boys.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tHis brother came back --

<b>tttDOROTHY 
</b>tFrom where?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tVietnam.

<b>tttDOROTHY 
</b>tOh. Are we going to talk about
tthis, about...?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tYou should hear. It's very sad, he
twas --

<b>ttttttJUMP CUT:
</b>
Janey is whispering something into Mikey's ear, who returns
to the kitchen.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tIt was a benefit for the ACLU or
tsomething, and Harry Reems himself
twas there --

<b>tttDOROTHY 
</b>tThe man with the -- from Deep
tThroat?

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tThe very one -- something about a
tfirst amendment defense fund --
twell I believe in it --

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tTed took me to see it.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tTed, how romantic.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tI have to say, the movie didn't do
tmuch for me. But being in that
ttheater, surrounded by all those
thorny young college boys and
tperverts, there was something in
tthe air that --

<b>ttttttJUMP CUT:
</b>
The boys are pouring wine.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>t-- pulls right up to the pump,
tjumps out like there's no gas
tshortage, oblivious, and by this
tpoint everybody in line's piling
tout of their cars ready to kill the
tguy, when they notice it's that
tReverend Edwards --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tThe Unitarian? The new one?

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tYeah -- claims he pulled off Creek
tRoad and didn't notice the line
tgoing back Mill Street for half a
tmile.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tHe's either got his head in the
tclouds or up his --

<b>tttDOROTHY 
</b>tI hear he's slept with half the
twomen in his congregation --

<b>tttTED 
</b>tLucky bastard!

As this is said, Mikey accidentally spills some wine on Ben.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tHell! -- I mean, no problemo there
tMikey. Here, I --

Janey leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe
of Ben's pants. Is there a just barely noticeable frisson
between Ben and Janey as she removes the napkin? If there is,
Elena doesn't -- or pretends not to -- notice.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
The boys, now in pajamas (Sandy's with padded feet, Mikey's a
combination of t-shirt and pj bottoms) are bringing out
coffee and dessert. The adults eye Mikey's handling of the
coffee pot with some nervousness.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tt(unconvincing)
tSo fascinating. Do you get free
ttickets to the movies, that kind of
tthing?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tNo, my job is just to analyze the
tentertainment stocks and advise our
tinstitutional investors on where to
tput their money. It's --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tDon't be so modest, Ben. It's a job
tthat requires a certain prescience
twith regards to entertainment
ttrends. You were the first to
tpredict that Billy Jack would be a
thit --

<b>tttBEN
</b>tt(with a bit too much
tt conviction) 
tAnd as usual no one believed me...

Silence.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
The dinner party has moved to the living room for after
dinner drinks. Elena remains behind to help Janey pick up the
table. She stacks a plate on top of another.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tPlease don't.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tIt's not a bother.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tI insist.
tt(beat)
tDon't touch them.

Elena realizes that there's an edge to Janey's voice.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tOh.

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tt(realizing she's gone too
tt far)
tIt's really quite all right.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tOf course.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
The party progresses. Mikey and Sandy are lying on their
stomachs at the top of the stairs, out of sight.

<b>tttDOROTHY 
</b>tAnd to think -- they met at a key
tparty of all things.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tA key party?

<b>tttDOROTHY 
</b>tYou know, it's a California thing.
tThat scuzzy husband of hers dragged
ther kicking and screaming to one
twhen they were out in L.A. you
tknow, the men put their car keys in
ta bowl, and then at the end of the
tevening the women line up and fish
tthem out and go home with whoever's
tkeys they've got. Anyhow that's how
tshe met this Rod person or whatever
this name is and he's left his wife
tand she's packing for California.
tIrwin is devastated. It's so
tironic.

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tIronic? 

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tt(caught out)
tWell, um, yes. Ironic. His name is
tRod.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS FRONT HALLWAY. NIGHT
</b>
The guests are leaving. The men shake hands, the women kiss,
and the men and women awkwardly peck each others' cheeks.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tThank you Janey.

<b>tttDOROTHY 
</b>tIt was lovely!

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tHey Jim, next time you've got to
tfill me in on whatever it is you're
tup to these days.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tWill do.

<b>INT. STAIRWAY. NIGHT
</b>
At the top of the stairs, a rather dejected Sandy and Mikey
finish spying on the leave-takings below. Mikey nudges Sandy,
and they silently head back the upstairs hall.

<b>INT. MIKE'S ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
They enter Mike's room -- the door has a "nuclear waste 
positively no admittance" sign on it.

As Mikey reaches his bed, he doubles over, groaning, and
starts to make retching noises. He then throws himself onto
the bed, his head leaning over the far side.

Sandy walks over and sees a pile of vomit next to the bed.
Taken aback for a moment, he then reaches forward and picks
it up -- it's fake plastic vomit. He throws it on top of
Mike's back, but Mikey doesn't take notice.

<b>tttSANDY
</b>tStupid!
tt(pause, looking sullenly
tt at Mike's back)
tIs Wendy Hood your girlfriend?

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tt(not looking up, but
tt alarmed)
tWho said so?

<b>tttSANDY
</b>tNo one.

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tI don't have a girlfriend.

Mikey returns to his reading -- a copy of The Sensuous Woman,
obviously well pawed over. He absentmindedly picks his nose.
As he flips the pages, a beautiful, almost electrical HUMMING
SOUND begins to fill his ears. He frowns and pauses to listen
to it.

Sandy, who has picked up a balsa wood miniature plane,
obviously doesn't hear it.

Mikey focuses on the plane as Sandy waves it through the air.
Perhaps the hum is the sound of its engines as it soars
through the sky...

<b>INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</b>
There is a large poster of a cartoon version of Richard Nixon
"Tricky Dick" -- on her wall. Wendy is on the phone to her
friend Beth.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>t-- he knows that when the March
t24th tape -- you know with Dean,
twhere Dean tells him that there's a
tcancer growing on the presidency --

She pauses as Beth asks a question.

<b>tttWENDY (CONT'D)
</b>tWho? No way. He's like a big
tinfected whitehead wearing jeans. I
twouldn't --

She hears the downstairs door open.

<b>tttWENDY (CONT'D)
</b>tt(whispering)
t-- shit, it's my parents.

She turns her light out.

<b>INT. HOOD UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. NIGHT
</b>
Ben and Elena walking past Wendy's room to their bedroom.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYou'd think she'd learn how to cook
ta chicken, eh? My drumstick was
tstill frozen when you cut inside
tthere. I'm probably going to get
twhatever that disease -- and Jim,
thow that guy ever became a
tmillionaire --

He pauses before a hall table, and, with his eyes, traces the
telephone cord under Wendy's room.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tHmm. I knew she'd still be up.
tWatch this --

But Elena simply continues into the master bedroom.

He starts to pull gently on the cord. And continues pulling.
No response for a few seconds. Then:

<b>CONTINUED: 25
</b>
<b>tttWENDY (O.S.)
</b>tt(yelling behind her door)
tDad stop it!

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tGet to sleep young lady -- and I

Wendy opens the door to her room.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tFascist!

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tIf I were a fascist I would have
tsent you to one of those Southern
tmilitary academies a long time ago.
tNow get to bed.

She slams the door.

He opens it.

<b>INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
</b>
Ben enters the room, angry.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tHey!

Wendy jumps into bed and under the covers, pulling them up
over her head. He stands over her, looking down at the
crumpled pile of sheet and blanket.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tt(softening)
tHey, kiddo. Sleep well, huh.

He places his hand where her cheek should be, and caresses
the sheet.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tt(without pulling the sheet
tt down, but nicely)
tGood-night dad.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tGood night kiddo.

Ben turns to the door, where he sees a silent Elena standing
in her nightgown, a slight smile on her face.

<b>INT. HOOD BEDROOM. NIGHT
</b>
Elena is sitting cross-legged, eyes closed, on her side of
the bed. We hear the toilet flush from the master bath, and
see Ben emerge in his boxers. He pauses in front of the bed,
looking at Elena.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tt(without opening her eyes)
tYou're staring at me.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI wasn't star--

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI've been thinking, Ben, about
tWendy. I was going to ask if she'd
tcome with me sometime to meet Dr.
tWoolens.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tThat shrink -- the one you always
twanted me to see? I thought you
tdropped him.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI did, but -- somebody should
tprobably see her, talk to her...
tYou think she's ok?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWhy shouldn't she be?

Elena just gives him a look, more sad than angry.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tt(pause)
tThen again, why should she be? I
tmean with us, with our...

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tSo maybe you'll come too?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tOh not again Elena! If we've got
tproblems, why can't you just come
tout and talk about them.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tIt's you Ben who needs to talk.
tI've had my say, and I'm waiting to
thear back from you.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYeah but Elena, even you don't
tbelieve all that "I'm OK. You're
tOK" stuff you keep babbling about --
tyou say so yourself. I've been all
tears for about ten years now on his
tsubject, and --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>t-- And you haven't moved out yet.
tIt's because you're too lazy, Ben.
tToo scared or lazy to either deal
twith us or simply make a decision --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tElena.

Silence.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tt(sighing)
tSleep in the study? Please.

Ben picks up a pillow and walks out, pausing wistfully at the
door.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tGood night.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tGood night.

<b>INT. WENDY'S ROOM. NIGHT

Wendy hears her parents' door close and sees a strip of light
illuminate under her door as the hall light goes on, then
off.

<b>EXT. MANHATTAN OFFICE BUILDING. DAY

A nondescript, cleanly "modern" building. Engraved on the
doors: "Shackley and Schwimmer, Securities Brokerage -

<b>INT. SHACKLEY AND SCHWIMMER CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY
</b>
Ben, seated, is finishing a brief presentation to a small
group of men, which includes George Clair, mid-thirties,
unctuously handsome.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tBut what, exactly, is stagflation,
tthis mixture of inflation and
tstagnation, and how should we in
tthe securities industry understand
tand accommodate it? Well -- and I
thope I'm not out of bounds here -
tthink of the money supply as a
tlarge male organ, continuously
tinflating, and yet, the societal
tvaginal cavity simply wants more.
tAs the vicious circle of higher
treturns without real satisfaction
tcontinues, the money-organ may seem
tto be in demand, but in fact even
tthe most inflated capital is
tunwanted. This is why I suggest
tthat while we engage this mawing
tabyss for the highest returns, we
tat the same time fantasize, so to
tspeak, of the safe harbor of
tcapital appreciation.

The aging boss nods agreement.

<b>tttSHACKLEY
</b>tt(more or less mumbling)
tBrilliant, brilliant.

George Clair just grins.

<b>INT. BEN HOOD'S OFFICE. DAY
</b>
Ben is gathering papers, readying to leave. He looks up to
see George Clair in his doorway.

<b>tttGEORGE 
</b>tHey there Benjie, you're becoming
tquite the in-house philosopher.
tWhen do you have time to think up
tall that stuff -- Shackley sure
teats it up.

<b>INTERCUT HALL IN FRONT OF BEN HOOD'S OFFICE
</b>
As we see that Clair is deftly fondling Hood's attractive
secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to
his office. She looks up coyly at Clair, hidden for the
moment from Ben's view.

Ben comes out of his office, pulling his coat on. Clair and
the secretary pull back, but it's clear that Ben has some
sense of what's transpiring between them.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tGeorge, I'm just trying to get a
tglobal view of things -- can't just
tlook at the small picture.

There's an obvious rivalry between the two of them.

<b>tttGEORGE 
</b>tAnd speaking of which, you have
tthose market share charts Mr.
tShackley was asking about?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tGotcha George, not a problem.
tTomorrow. Hey, you want to start
tcovering the old filmed
tentertainment sector yourself?

<b>tttGEORGE 
</b>tBen you know that's your territory 
t- and I wouldn't dream to trespass 
t- you're the expert. Hey, how do

</b>tOverpriced bomb, cost over $6

The secretary pretends not to hear.

<b>EXT. UNIVERSITY CLUB. DAY
</b>
An august New York institution. To establish.

<b>INT. CLUB RESTAURANT. DAY
</b>
A stuffy, Ivy League atmosphere. A decades-old tradition of
serving overcooked American food. Ben is seated across from
his father, Harold Hood, a retired curmudgeon. There is a
walker parked by Harold's chair.

<b>tttHAROLD
</b>tt(waylaying a passing
tt waiter) 
tI'd asked for that double martini
tabout three hours ago!

<b>tttWAITER 
</b>tComing right up, sir.

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tSo asking me out for lunch -- what

tOf course I'm paying.

</b>tWe don't have to always go to your

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tAnd why are you still calling me

talready, and --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>t-- Well what am I supposed to call
tyou?

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tThat's besides the point.

The martini arrives, along with Ben's beer.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI was actually trying to see about
tgetting a little advice, you know --

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tAdvice? I'm supposed to be getting
tthe stock tips from you, Ben.
tUnless - have you quit your job?
tThey fired you?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYou know, dah--

He looks up and sees his father slurping his martini, not
paying attention.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tActually it's not about work, it's

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tOh for crying out loud Ben, you

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWell, Elena and I have kind of been

<b>tttHAROLD
</b>t-- Your mother, God bless her,

</b>t-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad? 
tt(back to Ben)
tYou want advice Ben? If your big

tLook kid, you married that woman

Ben ponders, as the food arrives.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tt(weakly)
tBut...

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tBut what?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tBut I -- well maybe I love her.

His father rolls his eyes and stabs his salad with a fork.

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tChrist Ben! Make up your mind and
teat your lunch.

<b>INT. BOOK STORE. DAY
</b>
Elena browses the self-help section. A longish-haired,
slightly gone-to-seed, but still handsome clergyman pauses
next to her. He's wearing an ecclesiastical collar and bell
bottoms.

He pulls out a copy of Me, Myself and I, glancing again at
Elena.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tElena. Elena Hood, am I right?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tYes.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tReverend Edwards. Philip Edwards.

</b>tYes, it was -- I ended up --

<b>tttPHILIP
</b>tt(smiling)
tNo need to make excuses --

<b>EXT. NEW CANAAN HIGH SCHOOL FIELD. DAY
</b>
A cool gray afternoon. A group of boys are playing flag
football on the field, while two groups of girls are gathered
underneath the bleachers at either end, warily smoking
c1garettes.

Wendy, Beth, and a couple of other girls are gathered in one
group.

<b>tttBETH
</b>tt(referring to one of the
tt girls gathered in the
tt other group)
tShe said you licked Dave Brewster's
tweenie in the third floor bathroom.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tShe's a liar. I wouldn't touch Dave
tBrewster's dick if you paid me.
tIt's probably crawling with v.d.
tafter he put it in her, which he
tdid.

The conversation peters out at this point, as the two groups
of girls give each other the hairy eyeball from afar.

Wendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto the
field where the boys are playing.

A group of boys break from a huddle, Mikey among them.

The quarterback takes the hike and Mikey runs out for a pass.
As he runs, his breathing increases in volume, filling his
ears, and transforming into the humming sound he'd heard
before.

The quarterback spots him and throws a long one.

He runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound.

The ball drops next to him as he continues, in a world of his
own, to run.

Suddenly, the humming ends and he stops and turns around, to
see all the other kids just standing there looking at him.
One of them makes a pot-smoking gesture, as if that's the
explanation.

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tt(as he returns to the
tt group, ball in hand)
tDid anybody hear that?

The other kids snicker. Wendy looks on, and catches Mikey's
eye for a fleeting moment.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tI gotta go.

She takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off.

<b>INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY
</b>
Elena and Philip are seated at a booth.

<b>tttPHILIP
</b>tIt's been a tremendously
ttransformative year -- maybe a
tlittle controversial of course, but
twe're breaking down the old
tUnitarian barriers --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI suppose my reluctance was the
tgroup aspect of it -- I've never
tbeen much of a joiner, although I
tstill consider myself a somewhat
treligious person --

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tWell I of course flatter myself
tthat our church is not exactly what
tmost people would call organized
treligion -- at times it's the
tdisorganization that's liberating --
tand of course I've begun to
tminister much more in what one
tmight call therapeutic
tenvironments, in small groups, and
tone on one, couples --

Elena looks outside the window, and sees Wendy speed past on
her bicycle.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tt(cutting him off)
tMy daughter. I haven't been on a
tbike for years.
tt(still not really looking
tt at him)
tWhen was the last time you rode a
tbike?

<b>tttPHILIP
</b>tt(a bit taken aback by the
tt abrupt topic change)
tThey say you never forget.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tt(jarred back to his
tt presence) 
tForget what?

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tForget how to ride a bike.

Silence.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tNo, of course you don't, you're
tright.

<b>EXT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY
</b>
Wendy pulls her bike up to the back, locks it, and walks in.

<b>INT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY
</b>
Wendy moves with a certain amount of stealth through the
aisles, arriving at the candy selection.

She looks around.

She takes a package of twinkies and slips them into the
oversized pockets of her painter's pants.

She turns around, and her breath goes out of her -- an OLD
WOMAN has been watching her shoplift. The woman looks sadly
at her, but says nothing. Wendy slowly walks past her and out
the back door of the store. The woman looks on.

<b>EXT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY
</b>
As she walks her bike onto the sidewalk, Wendy comes across
Sandy.

<b>tttSANDY
</b>tHey Wendy.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tHey Sandy.

<b>tttSANDY
</b>tMikey was looking for you.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tYeah? See ya.

She pushes off on her bike.

Sandy gazes after her. He takes his G.I. Joe out of his coat
pocket, and points it at her.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tBam.

<b>EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS. DAY
</b>
Wendy flies along on her bike. It's a desolately beautiful
fall day.

<b>EXT. SILVER MEADOWS PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE. DAY
</b>
Wendy rides by the front gates of the posh grounds of the
private psychiatric clinic. A security guard leans against a
booth.

Once a bit past the gate, she gets off her bike and walks it
into a grove of trees near the front drive.

<b>EXT. SILVER MEADOWS. DAY
</b>
Mikey is waiting amid the trees next to his bike as Wendy
arrives.

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tWant some gum?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tSure.
tt(pulling them out of her
tt pocket)
tTwinkie?

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tt(opens his mouth,
tt displaying the gum on his
tt tongue)
tI'm chewing.

She puts the Twinkies back, and pops the gum in her mouth.

They stand together chewing.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tt(after a pause)
tDid you tell Sandy?

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tTell Sandy? What?

Wendy doesn't say anything.

<b>tttMIKEY (CONT'D)
</b>tYou didn't tell him either, did
tyou?

<b>EXT. SILVER MEADOWS SWIMMING POOL. DAY
</b>
The wind is picking up and the light is fading. Mikey and
Wendy climb the fence around the pool, which is empty and
half-covered in dead leaves and twigs.

They climb down into the concrete recess and walk into the
deep end, leaning against the far wall of the pool.

They each matter-of-factly take their gum out and put it
behind their ears.

They begin not so much to kiss as to place their tongues in
each others' mouths.

We see them from high above the pool, as the dead leaves
swirl lightly around them, Mikey groping under Wendy's
poncho.

<b>EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. DAY
</b>
To establish.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. DAY
</b>
A couple are in the final throes of lovemaking. We see Janey
Williams's face, more or less enjoying the proceedings. The
man gives a final heave and groan, and rolls off to reveal
himself to be -- Ben Hood.

<b>ttttttJUMP CUT TO:
</b>
Janey smokes a cigarette. Ben is babbling.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tWe were golfing, and you know,
tgolfing to me is something I'm
tsupposed to enjoy, and I was on the
tgoddam golf team in college, so
tit's something one would assume I
tdo well -- I used to do well -- but
tbasically these days golfing for me
tis like hoeing, or plowing.

Janey smiles briefly at this.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tIt's like farming. I am basically
tchewing up large tracts of
texpensively landscaped scenery with
toverpriced sticks, and George Clair
thas obviously, in the mere two
tyears since he joined the firm, he
thas obviously been taking secret
tlessons with a golf pro, and I
tassume the entirety of his
tdisposable income has been devoted
tto humiliating me on the golf
tcourse. And the guy talks -
tincessantly -- throughout the
tentirety of the miserable 18 holes 
t- on topics that are the supposed
tdomain of my department --

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tBen--

<b>tttBEN
</b>tYeah?

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tt(gently)
tYou're boring me. I have a husband.
tI don't particularly feel the need
tfor another.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tYou have a point there. That's a
tvery good point. We're having an
taffair. Right. An explicitly sexual
trelationship. Your needs. My needs.
tYou're absolutely right.

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tYou should probably get dressed.
tThe boys will be home soon.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tGotcha.

She wraps a blanket around herself and gets up.

<b>EXT. BACK OF WILLIAMS HOUSE. EVENING
</b>
Ben cautiously walks out he back door and heads for the side
gate.

<b>INT. HOOD KITCHEN. EVENING
</b>
Wendy enters the house as Elena is finishing supper
preparations.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tHi mom.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tHi Wendy.

Without waiting for instructions, Wendy starts pulling out
plates and silverware and setting the table.

<b>tttELENA (CONT'D)
</b>tI saw you on your bike today.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tWith Mikey?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tWho?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tWe were just riding around.

Elena takes this in.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tWell, you looked very -- free --
twhen I saw you.

Wendy continues setting the table.

<b>tttELENA (CONT'D)
</b>tWeightless almost -- as if I were
tseeing my own memories of being a

tabout it.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tMom. Are you ok?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tWendy, of course. I'm sorry. You

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tYou're not a psycho!

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tThe people at Silver Meadows aren't

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tWell, I saw what I saw, and if you
tdon't want to believe me --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tOh Wendy.

Wendy frowns.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tThey need the money for my band
tuniform at school.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI thought you quit the band - I
tnever hear you practice anymore.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tI don't really need to practice. I
tjust play a few notes, you know, so
tI thought maybe I'd stay in.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tWell, I'm sure your father and I
twould love to hear what you're
tplaying these days. Maybe after
tdinner.

<b>INT. HOOD LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
Ben and Elena take their seats on the sofa. Wendy stands
before them holding an enormous trombone, with a music stand
and sheet music in front of her.

She puffs a series of seemingly disconnected notes in waltz
time.

When she's done, she looks up from the sheet music to her
parents.

They applaud.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tCan't wait to see how it fits in
twith all the other instruments.

Elena gives him a look.

<b>INT. HOOD KITCHEN. NIGHT
</b>
Elena is sorting through bills and writing checks at the
kitchen table. Ben comes in and fills a glass with ice.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tThe Halfords have invited us again
tthis year.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tYou want to go?

<b>tttELENA
</b>tWhat do you think?

<b>tttBEN
</b>tWell, it is a neighborhood
ttradition.

He comes up behind her, looks down at the checkbook.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tI'm, uh, going to bed.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tSo early?

<b>tttBEN
</b>tRough day. Good night.

He leans over and kisses her on the cheek. She sniffs.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tIs that a new aftershave?

He recoils a bit.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tOh yeah. Musk, or something. You
tlike it?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tHmm. Good night.

He walks uncertainly from the room. Does she suspect?

<b>INT. MIKE'S ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
Mikey is painfully at work writing an English essay. Sandy
comes to the door with a geometry textbook.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tMikey?

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tYeah?

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tGeometry?

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tSure, anything but this English.

Sandy puts the open textbook in front of him.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tWhy are you so good at math but not
tin English?

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tI'm not good at math. Just
tgeometry.

He looks at the book.

<b>tttMIKEY (CONT'D)
</b>tt(drawing out his examples
tt on a piece of paper) 
tIt's like, you know when they say
t"two squared"? And you think it
tmeans 2 times 2, equals 4? But
treally they really mean a square. A
tsquare with a side of two. And the
tarea of the square is four. Like
tevery time you use the word, like
tsquared, or cubed, it's really
tspace, it's not numbers, it's
tspace.
tAnd it's perfect space, but only in
tyour head, because you can't draw a
tperfect square, like in the
tmaterial world, but in your mind,
tyou can have perfect space.
tt(pause)
tYou know?

As Mikey goes on, we see his geometric doodles, and hear
faintly the HUMMING SOUND under his voice.

<b>tttSANDY
</b>tYeah. But I just need some help
twith my homework.

A knock at the door. Jim stands in the doorway with a
suitcase in his hand.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tHey guys, I'm back.

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tt(honestly confused)
tYou were gone?

Sandy looks at Mikey as if pondering a lost cause.

<b>tttJIM
</b>tt(a look of
ttdisappointment) 
tYeah Mikey. Yep, I was in Houston,
tworking on some great new ideas
tabout silicon, which comes from
tsand, very conductive. How you guys

Mikey's still flustered.

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tUh, I dunno. OK I guess.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tHmm. Alright!

He walks off.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tYou really didn't notice? Man, he's

<b>INT. WILLIAMS BEDROOM. NIGHT
</b>
Janey is reading, still dressed, on the bed. She nods to Jim
as he enters with his suitcase.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tGood trip?

He nods and puts his suitcase down, then sits heavily on the
side of the bed.

<b>tttJIM
</b>tt(as he sits)
tYou bet.

It turns out it's a water bed, and his weight creates a wave
that nearly pushes Janey off her edge of the bed.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tJust be careful.

<b>tttJIM
</b>tt(as he begins to unpack)
tYou notice anything with Mikey
tlately? The kid seemed a little out
tof it tonight, eh?

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tTonight? Jim, he's been out of it
tsince he was born.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tHell, I guess he takes after me,

He laughs to himself.

She gives him a look.

<b>INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY
</b>
Elena and Philip Edwards are having coffee again.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tIn many ways, the church-bound
ttradition of the father, son, and
tholy ghost is simply a version of
tthe parent-child-adult triad within
tus all. It's a primitive set of
tsymbols for our inner psychology.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tYou're saying that Christ is the
tchild, and --

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>t-- And God the angry parent, and
tthe Spirit the hope of an
tintegrated adult self.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tAll well and good -- But tell me
tagain what is it exactly that you
tbelieve in?

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tYou ask what the point is?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tThat's right.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tSelf-realization. Ministering to
thelp people reach their fullest
tpotential. Would you believe me if
tI told you I want you to see
tyourself reach your fullest
tpotential and self-realization?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI would say it sounds like you're
ttrying to get me into bed.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tIf that's a potential you see
tyourself fulfilling... I mean... 
tt(flustered)
tMy, I sound a bit --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I
tdidn't mean to be so rude.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tYou weren't. You actually, for some
treason, you have the effect on me
tof making me feel just a tiny bit
tashamed of myself.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tBut not too ashamed.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tt(smiling)
tNow you are being rude.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tAnd you're still trying to get me
tinto bed.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tOuch.

Just then, Dorothy Franklin passes by their table, a smirk
firmly implanted on her face.

<b>tttDOROTHY 
</b>tHello you two. Am I barging in on
tsome kind of religious study group?
tElena, you look marvelous. Will I
tsee you and Ben at the Halford's?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI suppose we'll make an appearance.

<b>tttDOROTHY 
</b>tAnd Reverend Edwards? Did you make
tthe list?

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tt(laughing)
tI believe so Mrs. Franklin.

<b>tttDOROTHY 
</b>tWith the two of you there it will
tbe positively a revival! I'm off!

She scurries out of the coffee shop.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tI'm afraid she's something of a
tgossip, isn't she?

<b>tttELENA
</b>tt(gathering her things to
tt go)
tI'm afraid people around here
tprovide her with quite a bit to
tgossip about. 
tt(getting up)
tTake care.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tThat I will indeed.

<b>INT. CLASSROOM. DAY
</b>
Mikey is reading his English paper before the class.

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tBecause of molecules we are
tconnected to the outside world from
tour bodies. Like when you smell
tthings, because when you smell a
tsmell it's not really a smell, it's
ta part of the object that has come
toff of it -- molecules. So when you
tsmell something bad, it's like in a
tway you're eating it. This is why
tyou should not really smell things,
tin the same way that you don't eat
teverything in the world around you 
t- because as a smell, it gets
tinside of you. So the next time you
tgo into the bathroom after someone
telse has been there, remember what
tkinds of molecules you are in fact
teating.

An embarrassed silence.

<b>INT. SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM. DAY
</b>
Band practice. The New Canaan High School band is doing a
wind version of a popular rock tune.

In front, there's Wendy, in halter top and hip-hugging bell
bottoms, incongruously blowing away on her trombone -- this
being her one stab at extracurricular activities.

In the flute section directly behind her is Sandy, piping
away on a tiny piccolo. He sits on a riser slightly elevated
above her.

He directs downward at Wendy a protracted regard, a look of
intense concentration on his face.

<b>SANDY'S POV:
</b>
Wendy's backside, her pants pushed outward in the back,
affording Sandy a libido-charged view of the top of her bum
crack.

Push in on a close-up of this cherished abstract landscape,
then back to Sandy's furrowed face.

<b>INT. CLUB RESTAURANT. DAY
</b>
Ben and Harold are at their table again. Lunch is being
cleared.

<b>tttHAROLD
</b>tIt's not the taxes I object to.
tIt's all the fines and penalties.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tAlright dad. But you sold the
thouse, you didn't tell anyone,
tincluding the IRS, and I'd of
tcertainly liked to have seen if
tthere was any old stuff --

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tIt was all junk!

Another pause. Ben decides not to pursue an overworked topic.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tOh. Elena wanted to know when we
tcould expect you on Thanksgiving.
tIt's just going to be you this
tyear.

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tBen, I'm going to Florida. I hate
tThanksgiving and I hate the cold. I
thave a new nurse. She's a negro,
tshe weighs three hundred pounds,
tand I've decided to leave my entire
testate to her.

Ben spits his drink out.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWhat?

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tJesus, Benjamin, you're still as
tgullible as ever.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tThat was a joke? You don't tell
tjokes.

<b>tttHAROLD 
</b>tI thought I'd start trying. If you
tdon't mind. But I am going to
tFlorida and I do have a new nurse.

<b>INT. TRAIN. EVENING
</b>
Ben sits in the moving train, commuting home. He puts down
his paper to look at this fellow passengers. [NOTE: He is in
the same seat as was Paul at the beginning of the film.]

<b>INT. HOOD DEN. DAY
</b>
Elena sits in a yoga pose.

<b>INT. HOOD GARAGE. DAY
</b>
Elena enters the garage from the kitchen and turns the light
on.

She finds an old bicycle and pulls it out.

<b>EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS. DAY
</b>
Elena rides her bike into town, infused with the girlish
sense of freedom she imagined for her daughter.

Suddenly, there's a pop -- a tire is blown out. She slows
down and gets off the bike. As she bends to look at the
wheel, a station wagon slows near her. The driver's side
window rolls open. It's Janey Williams.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tNeed a lift?

<b>INT. JANEY'S CAR. DAY
</b>
Elena sits in the passenger seat. The two women are obviously
uncomfortable with each other.

Silence.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tThanks again. For the dinner.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tThanks for eating it. I don't know
twhy I even pretend I can cook.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI used to know how to cook.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tIt's not like we're too busy.

They smile, barely.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI'm thinking of going back to
tschool.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tSocial work?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tHow'd you know?

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tEducated guess.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI'm that predictable? No, you don't
thave to answer that. It's just that
twith the kids almost grown --

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tYou don't have to apologize. I'm
ttoo much of a cynic. You actually
tseem to be trying to figure things
tout -- don't mind me.

She pulls the car over.

<b>EXT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY
</b>
Janey's car pulls to the curb.

<b>INT. CAR. CONT'D
</b>
<b>tttJANEY
</b>tHere you are.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tt(opening her door)
tThanks for the lift. If the bike's
tany bother--

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tNone at all. I'll leave it in front
tof your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.

<b>EXT. FIVE AND DIME. CONT'D
</b>
Elena watches the car pull away. She turns and walks into the
store.

<b>INT. FIVE AND DIME. DAY
</b>
Elena moves through the aisles, putting various sundries into
a basket.

She pauses in front of the lipsticks.

She picks up a lipstick, looks at it, then quietly places it
in her pocket.

We see her reflection in the security mirror above the aisle,
as she quickly exits the store.

The middle-aged lady behind the counter watches her leave.

<b>EXT. FIVE AND DIME. DAY
</b>
In a wide shot, from across the street, we see Elena leave
the store, followed by the shopkeeper who runs behind her and
taps her on the shoulder. They converse for a minute, and
Elena is accompanied back into the store.

Through the store windows we see her take the lipstick out of
her purse. She's obviously distraught -- offering to pay,
talking quickly, etc. The shopkeeper is holding a telephone,
not yet decided on whether to call her in.

<b>tttPAUL (V.O.)
</b>tTo find yourself in the Negative
tZone, as the Fantastic Four often
tdo, means that all everyday
tassumptions are inverted -- even
tthe invisible girl herself becomes
tvisible, and so she loses the last
tsemblance of her power.

<b>INT. TRAIN. DAY
</b>
Close on images from The Fantastic Four.
<b>t"HERE IN THE NEGATIVE ZONE, HIS
</b><b>tPOWERS ARE HALVED. WE CAN DO
</b><b>tNOTHING BUT WAIT... AND PRAY" "BUT
</b><b>tWHAT ABOUT FRANKLIN? HE'LL BE

Paul sits reading on his way home.

<b>EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. DAY
</b>
Janey pulls up in the driveway. As she gets out of the car,
she hears a small explosion from the back of the house.

<b>EXT. HOOD BACKYARD. DAY
</b>
Janey comes around the back to discover Sandy stuffing a
model airplane with m-80 firecrackers. He lights them and
runs back a safe distance. The plane explodes, its wreckage
joining the debris from a few other dolls, models, and toys.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tSandy!

Sandy looks up -- busted.

Janey marches over to him.

<b>tttJANEY (CONT'D)
</b>tYou little idiotic prick, you could
tblow yourself fucking sky high with
tall this demented crap.

Sandy looks on the verge of tears. She softens and bends down
to him.

<b>tttJANEY (CONT'D)
</b>tt(sighing)
tHey.
tt(picking up the
tt firecrackers)
tI'll take this stuff.

<b>tttSANDY
</b>tYou going to tell dad?

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tWould it matter?
tt(sees something else lying
tt on the ground)
tAnd what's that?

<b>tttSANDY
</b>tt(sniffling)
tYou know, it's the whip -- the one
tuncle Frank got me from Mexico.

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tIt's not packed with explosives, is
tit?

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tNo!

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tt(going into the house)
tPlay with the whip.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. DAY
</b>
Mikey and Wendy are in front of the TV, watching a rerun of
Divorce Court.

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tOh. Hi Wendy.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tHi Mrs. Williams.

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tMikey, have you heard the
texplosions coming from the
tbackyard?
tt(he stares blankly at her)
tDo you know what Sandy's been up
tto?

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tt(honestly oblivious, as
tt usual)
tI dunno.

She pauses, then walks into the kitchen.

<b>EXT. WILLIAMS BACKYARD. DAY
</b>
Sandy flicks his enormous whip in the direction of a small
bush.

One by one, he snaps off its leaves.

<b>INT. WILLIAM KITCHEN. DAY
</b>
Janey hauls a turkey out of a bag and into the fridge.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. DAY
</b>
Mikey and Wendy are still in front of the TV.

Janey comes in again and looks at them.

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tDon't you kids have homework?

<b>tttMIKEY AND WENDY 
</b>tt(without looking up, in
tt unison)
tThanksgiving break.

She walks out of the room again.

Sandy comes in, whip in hand, looks over at Mikey and Wendy,
then walks over to them, and, without a word, slumps down
beside them and watches the TV.

<b>EXT. TOWN STREET. DAY
</b>
Elena walks unsteadily, pausing to rest against a brick wall.
She takes a deep breath, then walks to a corner where a local
taxi station wagon sits idling. She gestures to the driver,
who beckons her in.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. DAY
</b>
Later, still mentally devolving in front of the TV, but with
various junk food detritus surrounding them and a different
show, a rerun of the original Highway Patrol.

Sandy wanders off.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
Later.

Wendy gets up, goes upstairs, and wanders down the hall to
the bathroom.

She gets to the door just as Sandy gets there from the
opposite direction.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tAfter you.

Sandy hesitantly opens the door, as Wendy still hovers by it.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tWell, you can...

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tHey Sandy, what were you blowing up
tout there? Your mom was pretty
tp.o.'d.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tAll my model planes.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tThe ones you built?

<b>tttSANDY
</b>tThey were old. And they couldn't
tfly anyhow. I'm going to get a
tradio-controlled airplane at
tChristmas, and then I'll stuff it
tfull of m-80s and then fly it into
tMrs. Burgess's English class and
tblow it up.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tI have to go to the bathroom.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tYeah.

But he stays put, unaware it seems that he's blocking the
doorway.

Wendy looks around -- no one in sight.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tI'll show you mine if you show me
tyours.

Sandy goes wide eyed, and almost against his will backs into
the bathroom like a feather.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. DAY
</b>
Mikey looks up from the TV, wondering where Wendy is. He eats
another Pringle.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS BATHROOM. DAY
</b>
Wendy flips up her dress for Sandy.

He slowly unzips, his hand unsteady. We can tell from the
look on Wendy's face that she's feeling a bit sorry for the
little guy.

Suddenly Sandy turns beet red, and bursts into tears.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tWhat do you want?! What do you
twant? Get out! Get out of here!

The door flips open -- and Janey Williams appears.

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tt(sizing up the situation) 
tShit.

<b>INT. MASTER BEDROOM. DAY
</b>
Janey is giving Wendy a lecture

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tA person's body is his temple,
tWendy. This body is your first and
tlast possession. Now as your own
tparents have probably told you, in
tadolescence our bodies tend to
tbetray us. That's why, in Samoa and
tin other developing nations,
tadolescents are sent out into the
twoods, unarmed, and they don't come
tback until they've learned a thing
tor two.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS HOUSE DOORWAY. DAY
</b>
Wendy is led to the door by Mrs. Williams.

Wendy trades a glance with a sullen Mikey, who sits in the
living room pretending to ignore her.

<b>EXT. STREET. DAY
</b>
Wendy walks her bike with the wind in her face.

From behind her, Mikey rides up on his bike and rides
alongside her.

She doesn't look at him.

Trying to stay on his bike, but moving slowly, he wobbles,
nearly falling off.

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tI don't ever want to see you.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tThen why'd you come after me?

<b>EXT. HOOD HOUSE. DAY
</b>
The taxi pulls up. Elena gets out and pays the driver.

<b>INT. HOOD KITCHEN. DAY
</b>
Ben is in front of the open freezer, trying to get something
out. He hears Elena come in the front door.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tElena. I need some help here if
tthis thing's gonna defrost by
ttomorrow.

She comes up and together they tug and pull until they
succeced in extracting a large, frozen turkey. As they pull
it out, it slips from their hands and, after a dull thump,
slides along the floor.

They smile.

Elena bends over to pick it up. Ben observes her. She notices
his look.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tHere.

He goes over and picks up the turkey, placing it in the sink.
He looks back at her and notices her vaguely distraught look.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tYou all right there?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tOh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to
tpick up the cranberry sauce?

<b>tttBEN
</b>tUm, yes.

They stand together, his concern and her vulnerability
forming an awkward attraction between them.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tBecause you like it on your turkey
tsandwiches.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI do. I'm -- are you...?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI... I think I am...

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tt(pause)
tYou know Elena, I've been thinking--

<b>tttELENA
</b>tBen, maybe no talking right now? If
tyou start talking, you're going to--

She kisses him as if she needed him.

<b>INT. HOOD HALLWAY. DAY
</b>
Ben and Elena enter their bedroom. Elena closes the door
quietly behind her.

<b>INT. HOOD BEDROOM. DAY
</b>
Ben and Elena undress shyly.

They make love. Elena's face is almost fearful.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
Elena and Ben lie in bed side by side in the pale afternoon
light. Neither speaks. Ben turns on his side, and notices a
small tear forming in Elena's eyes.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYou crying?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI'm just sad Ben -- I mean it
twas... you were, but, you know. I
tjust don't know...

tWhat is going to happen with us?
tHave you --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYou have to bring this up now?
tWhat? Did I do something here? Is
tthat it? Is it something I did?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's
tjust that we've got to be honest.
tNot just with ourselves, but with
tthe children.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tt(pause, sitting up)
tHell, I know. I -- I guess if you
twant to accuse me, you've got --
tt(looks at watch)
tOh hell! I've got to pick up Paul.
tI almost forgot.

He gets up and starts to get dressed.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tYou were saying?

He smells the armpits of the shirt he's putting on.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tYikes -- I was hoping to wear this
tthing to the Halford's Friday.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tThat shirt?

<b>tttBEN
</b>tWhat?

<b>tttELENA
</b>tLeave it -- I'll wash it for you.

He looks at her ruefully.

<b>EXT. HOOD STREET. DAY
</b>
Wendy walks and Mikey rides along.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tYou have to follow me?

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tI dunno. I --

They're now in front of the Hood's house.

<b>EXT. HOOD HOUSE. DAY
</b>
Ben exits the house in a rush, and sees Wendy and Mikey on
the street in front.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tHey there Mikey, how's business?

<b>CONTINUED: 85
</b>
<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tt(tripping off of his bike)
tBusiness? Uh, I dunno.

Ben grimaces, fiddles for his car keys.

As Mikey remounts and rides off, Wendy passes her father on
the driveway.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tI'm picking up Paul at the station 
t- want to come?

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tNah.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tWhat you been up to?

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tNothing.

<b>INT. HOOD LIVING ROOM. DAY
</b>
Wendy enters the house and climbs the stairs.

She sees the crumpled bed sheets in her parents' room and
hears Elena in the shower.

<b>EXT. NEW CANAAN STATION. DAY
</b>
Paul walks to the parking lot with his father, who carries
his duffel bag.

<b>EXT. STREETS. DAY
</b>
Ben's car heading back to the house with Paul.

</b>tYeah.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYou know Paul, I've been thinking,
tmaybe this is as good a time as any
tto have a little talk, you know,

He makes a sharp turn. Paul puts his arms up on the dashboard
to steady himself.

<b>tttPAUL
</b>tt(nervous)
tAbout?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWell, the whole gamut. Facts of
tlife and all. Some fatherly advice,

tenough... well...
tt(pause)
tFor example, on the self-abuse
tfront -- now this is important -
tit's not advisable to do it in the

texpect you to be doing it there in
tany case -- and, um, not onto the
tlinen, and not on your sister's
tunderwear or any clothing belonging
tto your mother --

He pauses to gauge the effect of his monologue on his son,
then continues.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tUh, Dad --

Just then Ben runs a stop sign and almost slams into another
car.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tHoly! Well. If you're worried about
tanything, just feel free to ask,
tand, uh, we can look it up.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tUh, dad, you know I'm 16.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tAll the more reason for this little
theart to heart... great.

<b>EXT. HOOD HOUSE. DAY
</b>
The car pulls up. Paul gets out, looking shell-shocked. He
sees Wendy waving to him from a second floor window. He nods
back.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tUm, Paul. On second thought, can
tyou do me a favor and pretend I
tnever said any of that.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tSure dad.

In the doorway, Elena waits.

</b>tHello, Charles.

They both ponder silently. Then:

</b>tMay I operate your telephonic

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tWhy don't you use the phone
tdownstairs?

<b>tttPAUL

<b>INT. HOOD BATHROOM. DAY
</b>
The shower is running, but Paul is standing by the open
window, puffing on a joint and trying to blow the smoke
outside.

<b>tttPAUL
</b>tI'll be out in a second.

Ben walks back to the bedroom, smirking.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tSure you will.

<b>INT. HOOD DINING ROOM. DAY
</b>
One by one, each member of the Hood carried in a final item
to place on the overstuffed Thanksgiving table. Then, one by
one, they each silently take their seats.

They look over the table. No one moves.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWell, it's great we can all be
ttogether. And this Thanksgiving, no
thysteria, no yelling, especially
twith grandpa not here, although we
tmiss him. So let's do it right and
tactually, Wendy, why don't you say
tgrace. You used to love to say
tgrace, remember.

Wendy grimaces, as they all bow their heads slightly.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tDear Lord, thank you for
tThanksgiving, and for letting us
twhite people kill all the
tIndians...

Everyone looks up.

<b>tttWENDY (CONT'D)
</b>t... and steal their tribal lands
tand stuff ourselves like pigs

Mutterings and groans: "Wendy!" "For Christ's sake" etc.

<b>tttWENDY (CONT'D)
</b>t... while children in Africa and
tAsia are napalmed and --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tJesus all right enough!

They all unceremoniously start to dig in.

<b>ttttttFADE OUT:
</b>
<b>INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. DAY
</b>
Janey Williams is pouring Benjamin Hood a drink from a bottle
of vodka. Benjamin is already unbuttoned and shoeless; Janey
still fully dressed.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tHere.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tAfter the Thanksgiving I had, I
tneed it. You having one?

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tIn a bit.

She sits next to him, he kisses the back of her neck.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYou know, I think Elena might
tsuspect something.

Janey gives him a rather contemptuous look.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tt(thinking aloud)
tMaybe it's all for the better, you
tknow?
tYesterday, at dinner, well, she
thasn't said anything... has she
tacted funny to you, I mean, have
tyou noticed anything?

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tt(almost ironic)
tHave I noticed anything? I'm not
tmarried to her Benjamin, you are. I
tthink you've probably a better
tvantage point from which to observe
ther.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYeah, but, I -- I've been working a
tlot lately, and -- No, that's not
tit. I guess we've just been on the
tverge of saying something, whatever
tit is, just saying something to
teach other. On the verge.

Janey gets up.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tI'll be back.

Benjamin looks at her quizzically.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tHuh?

<b>tttJANEY
</b>tBirth control.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tRight. Gotcha.

She leaves the room.

He leans back onto the bed. Sits back up. Takes a sip of
vodka. Puts the glass down. Takes his socks off. He's now in
just his jockey shorts and shirt.

Faintly, he hears a door close. The front door?

He takes another sip.

He hears another sound.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tJaney?

Nothing.

He goes to the door and carefully opens it.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tt(quietly)
tJaney?

He hears, quite audibly, a car door open, close, Janey's car
start and pull out.

He runs to a front window just in time to catch a glimpse of
her driving off.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tShit.

<b>INT. GUEST ROOM. LATER
</b>
Benjamin sits on the guest bed, still in his underwear,
drinking from the bottle.

He gets up and starts to wander around the house, still
holding the bottle.

<b>INT. MASTER BEDROOM. CONT'D
</b>
Benjamin saunters through. He presses on the king-sized bed --
it undulates.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tWater bed! Dig it!

He wiggles comically, making more waves.

<b>ttttttJUMP CUT:
</b>
Ben idly goes through Janey's drawers.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS MASTER BATHROOM. CONT'D
</b>
He rifles through the bathroom cabinet, checking out the
medicines.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS BEDROOM. CONT'D
</b>
He notices a garter belt hanging from the walk-in closet
door. He picks it up and twirls it.

<b>INT. MIKEY'S ROOM. CONT'D
</b>
Benjamin walks in, an obvious look of distaste.

He sorts through a few of Mike's things -- monster eyes that
glow in the dark, The Sensuous Woman, etc.

He twirls the garter belt absentmindedly, then tosses it into
the back of Mike's closet.

<b>INT. GUEST ROOM. CONT'D
</b>
He finishes putting his clothes back on. As he reaches for
the door, he hears voices and quickly steps back in again.

Teenage voices. Mikey and Wendy.

<b>tttMIKEY (O.S.)
</b>tSee, no one's here. Maybe you want
tto go to the basement?

<b>tttWENDY (O.S.)
</b>tMaybe we can just watch some TV.

<b>tttMIKEY (O.S.)
</b>tThere's a TV in the basement.

Hood hears their steps down into the basement.

<b>INT. BASEMENT. DAY
</b>
Wendy and Mikey stand in the middle of the semi-lit basement.

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tMaybe we can mess around. You know,
tonly if you want to...

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tI don't know.

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tWhy did you -- with Sandy?

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tI don't know.

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tYou like him? He worships you.

But Wendy doesn't seem to hear -- she's drawn to an object
lying next to a bean bag chair off to one side.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tHey, what's this?

With a look of utter fascination, she picks up a Nixon mask,
looking at it as though it were an archeological find.

<b>tttWENDY (CONT'D)
</b>tWow!

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tWendy!

She puts the mask on.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tt(from behind the mask)
tI won't take my pants off. But I'll
ttouch it. That's as far as it goes.

Mikey looks totally confused.

Remaining fully clothed, Wendy loosens Mike's belt, showing
no excitement from behind her mask, and lets him climb on top
of her for a dry hump.

Just then, a shaft of light hits them from the top of the
stairs -- Ben towers above them, looking down.

Mikey flips over immediately and pulls his clothes together,
grabbing a TV Guide as Wendy stands up, the mask still on.

As Ben descends Mikey, still stuffing his shirt-tail into his
pants, pretends to flip through the TV Guide.

<b>tttMIKEY
</b>tt(muttering)
tWhen worlds collide.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tHuh?

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>t4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.

Ben arrives, folds his arms.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWhat the hell are you kids doing
tdown here?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tWhat do you think we're doing, dad?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWhat do I think? I think you're
tprobably touching each other. I
tthink you're touching that reckless
tjerk-off, for god's sake, and I
tthink he's trying to get into your
tslacks. I think, at fourteen years
tof age, that you're getting ready
tto give up your girlhood --

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tHey, hang on there, Mr. Hood --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tDon't you direct a single word at
tme, Mikey. I don't want to hear it.
tI'll be speaking with your parents
tabout this situation very soon. Bet
tyour ass on that, son. Young lady?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tTalking to me, dad?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWho else would I be talking to? And
ttake that thing off!

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tt(pulling off the mask)
tWell, then forget all this stern
tdad stuff.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI'm not interested in your smart
tass remarks now, lady. Let's go.
tRight now. You and I can discuss it
ton the walk home.

She stands next to Mikey for a moment, both on the verge of
tears.

<b>EXT. STREET. EVENING
</b>
Hood and Wendy walk through a cold drizzling rain.

He looks at her from time to time, then takes her arm.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tLook, kiddo, don't worry about it.
tI really don't care that much. I'm
tjust not sure he's good enough,
tthat's all.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tHuh?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI mean, he's not serious, he'll end
tup living off Janey and Jim, you
twatch.
tIt's just that you develop a sense
twhen you get older, if things are
tgoing to work out or if they won't,
tand sometimes it's not worth the
tmess...

She looks at him. They keep walking. She walks through a
puddle.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tYour toes cold?

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tYeah.

He stops and lifts her in his arms.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tI'll carry you up the drive.

She puts her arms around his neck and he lifts her up.

On her face, as he carries her -- a look of blank but real
intimacy.

<b>INT. HOOD FRONT HALL. EVENING
</b>
Hood and Wendy enter, wet and cold, muttering hellos.

<b>tttELENA (O.S.)
</b>tt(from the kitchen)
tDinner in ten minutes.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tYou go dry off now.

Wendy heads for the stairs, Hood following.

<b>INT. HOOD BEDROOM. EVENING
</b>
Hood finishes taking off his wet clothes as Elena enters and
turns on a light. She stands watching him.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tNever guess where I found her.

Not much response From Elena.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tIn the basement over at Janey and
tJim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not
teven a TV on.
tAnd they're on the floor and he's
tgot his trousers down though thank
tgoodness she's still dressed. Well,
tI really let him have it! 
tt(a nervous laugh)
t... and Wendy came home
tpeacefully... Hey, should I dress
tfor the Halford's now, or - give me
tyour -

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tUp to you. I'd like to go early and
tleave pretty soon after that.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI get you loud and clear... hey,
tyou look nice.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tSo what were you doing in the
tWilliams' basement anyway?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tOh, just dropping off a coffee cup.
tJim left it, last time he was over.
tIt was on the dash of the car. You
twere, you know, reading, thought
tI'd just catch some air. Let's eat.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tOh right. The mustache coffee cup.
tThe one that was sitting on the
tdash.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYeah, that one.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tThat one.

She walks down to the kitchen, Benjamin following her.

<b>INT. KITCHEN. EVENING
</b>
Wendy is already in the kitchen, fishing through the drawers
for silverware and napkins.

Paul enters.

<b>tttPAUL
</b>tSee you. 

<b>tttBEN
</b>tStay out of trouble.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tYou'll be on the 10:30 train?

<b>tttPAUL
</b><b>t11:30?
</b>
<b>tttELENA
</b>tPaul --

<b>tttBEN
</b>tAh let the guy have his fun. What's
tthe name of this girl with the Park
tAvenue address?

<b>tttPAUL
</b>tLibbets. Libbets Casey.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tLibbets? What kind of name is
tLibbets?

<b>INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
</b>
A silent dinner of turkey sandwiches with Elena, Benjamin,
and Wendy. The turkey carcass sits, embarrassed, in the
middle of the table.

Wendy, finished, gets up from the table. Opens the fridge,
but finds nothing. Then goes to the candy shelf and grabs
some Hot Tamales, leaving the room without a word and going
into the den.

<b>INT. DEN. NIGHT
</b>
Wendy turns the TV on.

<b>tttTV
</b>t... and that ends today's highlight
tcoverage of the Watergate affair.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tShoot.

<b>INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
</b>
Hood and Elena rise from the table with their dishes.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tWhat's for dessert?

<b>tttELENA
</b>tSee for yourself.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tNo advice from the experts, huh?

His plate slips out of his hands into the trash. He fishes it
out and sets it on the counter.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tDon't start.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tYou think I --

<b>tttELENA
</b>tI have no idea.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tWhat's on your mind? Don't --

<b>tttELENA
</b>tIt wouldn't make a pleasant
tevening, if that's what you're
tafter. I don't want to talk about
tit. Stupid mustache cup.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tWhat do you mean?

<b>tttELENA
</b>tDon't be dim.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tElena, what are you're talking
tabout?

<b>tttELENA
</b>tI'm not surprised.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tListen, Elena, if you're gonna pull
tthat passive aggressive stuff on me
tagain --

<b>tttELENA
</b>tYour unfaithfulness -- that's what
tI'm trying to talk about. Your
tunfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your
tdalliance. And you won't do me the
tdignity of being up front about it.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tt(quieter)
tAm I unfaithful? Is that what
tyou're trying to say?

<b>tttELENA
</b>tIt's a starting place.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tWell, what kind of faithfulness are
tyou after?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tIf you're going to insult me --

<b>tttBEN
</b>tWhat else could I be? What else
tcould I be? We're not living in the
treal world here. You're living out
tsome fantasy land from the past, or
tsome advice or something from those
tpsychoanalysts... there are some
thard facts here.

Silence.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tIt's the law of the land... the
tgovernment, the world, those two
tguys on the Yankees... And I'm not
thaving any fun at it, I can tell
tyou that. I'm not...

<b>INT. DEN. NIGHT
</b>
Wendy puts the volume of the TV up, to drown out a
conversation she can almost overhear but doesn't want to.

<b>INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. CONT'D
</b>
<b>tttELENA 
</b>tOh lord. You think I'm so dense.
tAnd now you want to be seen with
tyour dense wife at the cocktail
tparty. You want to wear that
tridiculous shirt which doesn't go
twith those pants at all. You want
tto wear that, and you want me to
tshake hands with your friends and
tmake conversation and dress up in
tan outfit that shows a lot of
tcleavage and you're not going to
taccord me the respect of talking
thonestly about this... You don't
treally know what this feels like.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tt(whispering)
tSure I do. Do I know what
tloneliness feels like? Sure I do. I
tknow a lot about it, if that's what
tyou mean.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tBenjamin. That's supposed to
texplain it?

Seemingly tired, he stands before her. Silence. Elena sighs,
then walks into the den.

<b>INT. DEN. NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttELENA 
</b>tWe're going to the Halford's. The
tnumber's on the calendar in the
tkitchen. We should be home around
<b>t11.
</b>
<b>tttWENDY
</b>tt(eyes still glued to the
<b>tt TV)
</b>tIs it a big party? A big
tneighborhood party?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI suppose. Why?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tJust curious. If there's a problem,
tI guess I'll just call you there to
tinterrupt.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tWhat sort of problems are you
tplanning exactly?

Elena kisses the top of her head.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tt(still watching the TV)
tOh I thought I'd steal the station
twagon, drive up to a commune. Or
tset the house on fire. You know.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tJust bundle up. It's supposed to
tfreeze tonight. We'll see you in
tthe morning.

<b>EXT. HOOD HOUSE. NIGHT
</b>
Elena and Ben emerge from the house, and look up at a
darkening, foreboding sky. A light rain falls. They jog
toward their car.

<b>INT/EXT. HOOD CAR. NIGHT
</b>
The car moves slowly through the rainy suburban streets.

Inside, Elena and Ben don't speak.

<b>EXT. HALFORD HOUSE. NIGHT
</b>
Their Firebird pulls up. There are already many other cars
parked on the lawn and driveway.

<b>INT. HALFORD FOYER. NIGHT
</b>
Hood and Elena enter. Dot Halford accosts them.

<b>tttDOT 
</b>tBen, Elena. Wonderful! Wonderful!
tSo wonderful to see you.

Finishing the last of a celery canoe, she kisses the air next
to Ben's ear and gives Elena a manic hug.

Then, picking up a white salad bowl from the hall table:

<b>tttDOT (CONT'D)
</b>tWould you care to play? New this
tyear.

Close on: the bowl full of keys.

<b>tttDOT (CONT'D)
</b>tStrictly volunteer, of course. You
tcan put your coats in the library
tif you like.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tOh, damn. Uh, I've left the --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYou've...

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tIn the car.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tOh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right
tback, Dot.

<b>INT./EXT. CAR. CONT'D
</b>
Ben and Elena climb back in the car and close the doors,
shivering.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tThis just isn't the best moment for
tthis.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI know, I know. I had no idea --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tThat this was going to be a key
tparty?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tYeah, well, if we'd understood we
tcould have invented some kind of
texcuse. A key party -- did you see
thow stuffed that bowl was already?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tWell?

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI think we're here and we don't
thave to stay -- we ought simply to
tput in an appearance and then we
tcan head home.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tDamn it, Ben --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI'm not staying at this party so we
tcan go home with someone else's
twife. That's not why we're here,
tright? We're simply being neighbors
there, and I think we should do just
tthat --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tYou're not going to --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI'm not.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tYou have some marker, that's what I
tthink, if you want to know the
ttruth.
tYou have some marker and you're
tgoing to put it on the house keys
tso that Janey can find them and
tthen when I get back to the house
tI'll find the two of you in there
tand Wendy'll be able to hear you
tand Paul will be back and he'll
thear you and I'll catch you, that's
twhat I think. She'll be swearing
tand banging against the wall and
tI'll catch --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tElena.

She rubs her eyes.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tElena, it's not what you think.
tIt's not a big plot. Honestly.
tHonestly. I don't know if you want
tto go over this now, but it's just
tsomething that comes over me. I
tdon't feel good about it. I know
tI've done what I didn't want to do.
tI don't know --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tWell, I'm really pleased to hear a
tconfession.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tElena, you're just getting wound up
tto get wound up.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tThanks for the diagnosis, Ben.
tThank you. So let's just go to this
tfiasco if that's what you want to
tdo. Let's just go on in. I'd rather
ttalk to anyone else but you.

She pulls the keys out of the ignition, gets out of the car,
and slams the door. He follows her.

<b>INT. HALFORD FOYER. NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttELENA 
</b>tOh, Dot!

Elena, entering the house again, tosses the keys at Dot
Halford, who looks surprised.

Hood slides in behind his wife.

Dot drops the keys into the bowl.

Slow-motion, close up: the keys, on their equine chain, fall
in with a THUNDEROUS CRASH.

<b>INT. HALFORD LIVING ROOM. CONT'D
</b>
The room is crowded with nervous, expectant couples and
various groupings.

Elena slips into a side room.

Benjamin heads over immediately to the drink table and pours
a stiff one, turning around to find at his elbow none other
than George Clair.

<b>tttGEORGE 
</b>tBenjie!

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tClair, George Clair! What the hell
tbrings you to New Canaan?

<b>tttGEORGE 
</b>tWell, it's the funniest thing. I've
tbeen talking to some investors -- a
tlittle outside venture, you
tunderstand, between you and me --
tabout a scheme to manufacture a new
tStyrofoam packaging. Little peanut
tlike pieces that can really keep an
titem free from trauma during
tshipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it
tturns out the genius behind the
twhole project is your neighbor, Jim
tWilliams. How about that!

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWell, hey, isn't that a one-in-a
tmillion coincidence. A real
tdreamer, Jim Williams, eh?

<b>tttGEORGE
</b>tDarned right. Look here, Benj,
twhaddya make of this sequel to The
tGodfather? You think it's gonna
twork?

<b>tttBEN
</b>tDon't see how. I think the public's
thad its fill of this gangster
tstuff. No, trust me -- disaster
tpics. And air hockey.

<b>tttGEORGE
</b>tYeah, good.

Benjamin catches a glimpse of Janey, voluptuously attired,
across the room.

<b>tttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>tWell, gonna make a break for the
thors d'oeuvres guy.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tYeah, see you bright and early
tMonday am.
tt(beat)
tSay, where's the wife?

<b>tttGEORGE
</b>tt(winking as he goes)
tIn Rhode Island with the folks. I'm
ta free agent tonight.

At this, they both notice Elena slowly gliding across the
other side of the room. Clair gives Ben a sideways glance,
then moves on.

Ben makes straight for Janey, who pretends to be preoccupied
with a plant.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tOh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you
tare.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tDamn right, but where the hell were
tyou?

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tt(looking around)
tWhat are you talking about?

<b>tttBEN
</b>tt(whispering, but too
tt loudly)
tDon't bullshit me around, Janey.
tJesus Christ, I waited around for
tmore than half an hour, in nothing
tbut my boxer shorts, and -- and
twhat's all that about? What the
thell happened?

Janey takes a sip of her drink.

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tA prior engagement overcame me.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tWhat?

<b>tttJANEY 
</b>tListen, Benjamin Hood. I have
tobligations that precede your...
tfrom before you showed up. One or
ttwo, you know, good-natured
tencounters, that doesn't mean
tI'm... I'm not just some toy for
tyou. When I remembered some chores
tI wanted to get done before the
tparty, I just did them, that's all,
tbecause I wanted to do them before
tI saw Jimmy.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tJimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to

</b>tHow you take it isn't all that
tinteresting to me, Benjamin. I'm
tsorry --

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tI just can't believe you could be
tso --

Stalling, he watches her take another sip of her drink and
wander off.

The air is filled with talk of Watergate, Billie Jean King,
the Oil Crisis, the Mets.

Benjamin goes over to the couch, where Dave Gorman is
chatting up an attractive younger woman.

<b>tttGORMAN
</b>tt(lighting up a joint)
tWelcome to the Monkey House has

they Benjamin -- give it a try? This

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tt(waving it away)
tThanks for the advice Dave.

But then, Benjamin changes his mind.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tUh, well, what the hey...

Taking the joint, he tugs on it, holding the smoke in his

Benjamin walks over to a window. The outdoor lamps illuminate
a new and heavy downpour of frozen sleet.

<b>INT. CONRAIL TRAIN. NIGHT
</b>
Paul is seated, reading the latest number of The Fantastic
Four comic book. The cover displays a lurid, atomically
glowing baby.

The conductor walks through the cabin.

<b>tttCONDUCTOR 
</b>tApproaching our final stop, Grand
tCentral Station.

Paul looks out the window at the tenements of Harlem, barely
visible through the walls of sleet. Soon the train enters the
tunnel toward the station.

<b>EXT. PARK AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDING. NIGHT

Paul opens the door, and enters the apartment.

</b>
It's half dark, has an air of old wealth.

Libbets skids across the parquet floor to him.

<b>tttLIBBETS 
</b>tExcellent. We were waiting!

She turns and runs into the den.

<b>tttPAUL
</b>tt(under his breath)
tWe?

And there, in the den, cleaning an ounce of dope on an open
copy of Nixon's Six Crises, is -- Francis.

tYou oughtta read this Hood, Nixon,

Paul trudges disconsolately out of the room.

<b>INT. LIBBETS KITCHEN. NIGHT
</b>
Paul, after wandering a maze of halls, enters the kitchen,
where he takes a six-pack out of the fridge and returns to
the living room.

<b>INT. LIBBETS LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
He enters the room with the beer.

<b>tttLIBBETS
</b>tFrankie opens them with his teeth.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tt(handing him a beer)
tHey, it's a sellable skill.

Francis licks closed a second joint, then takes the beer and
opens it with his rear molars.

<b>tttFRANCIS
</b>tHell on the fillings.

Paul opens the other two beers and hands one to Libbets. They
light up a joint.

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tEverything's gonna freeze, the big
tfreeze.

<b>tttLIBBETS 
</b>tYeah, Paul, are you gonna get home

Paul and Francis exchange a look.

She puts an Allman Brothers tape on the 8-track and turns the
TV down.

<b>INT. HOOD BATHROOM. DAY
</b>
Wendy enters the bathroom.

She fills the sink with water, then turns off the tap. She
takes a razor blade from the counter, and slowly,
determinedly, holds it to her wrist.

She presses it into her skin, drawing a small drop of blood.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tOuch!

She drops the blade and splashes water on her wrist, grabbing
some toilet paper and holding it against the tiny wound.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tStupid.

She hears the phone ring and walks downstairs.

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tOut.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tIt's freezing.

<b>tttMIKEY

tSo when you breathe, there's

Sandy just looks at him. He walks out into the night.

<b>INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT

Elena sits on a couch, talking to no one, barely looking up,
when someone stands in front of her.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tReverend Edwards.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tPerhaps you might find it in your

He sits beside her.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tYou're here... I'm a bit surprised.

<b>tttPHILIP 
</b>tSometimes the shepherd needs the
tcompany of the sheep.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tI'm going to try hard not to
tunderstand the implications of that
tsimile.

Philip's about to reply, but thinks better of it.

They sit glumly next to each other for a minute. Then Philip
rises.

<b>tttPHILIP
</b>tForgive me.

He walks swiftly to the hall and hurriedly fishes his keys
out of the bowl, then heads for the door.

<b>tttTED FRANKLIN
</b>tt(passing by)
tI hope those weren't my keys.

He laughs at his own joke as Philip rushes out the front
door.

Back to Elena, even more forlorn than before.

<b>INT. LIBBETS APARTMENT BATHROOM. NIGHT
</b>
Paul enters the bathroom. We hear Francis' and Libbets'
voices from the other room, laughing.

He pees.

At the sink, he pauses in front of the medicine cabinet, then
opens it.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tEureka.

He pulls out some bottles.

<b>tttPAUL
</b>tValium. Seconal. Uh,

tt this one)
tPar-er-goric?
tt(a beat, looking into the

He pockets the Seconal and turns out the light.

Paul re-enters the den to find Francis alone.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tAnd whence has yon virginal maiden
tabsconded?

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tLike into one of the other 20 or so

</b>tPharmaceutical! You are a god.

<b>tttPAUL (CONT'D)
</b>tt(picking up beer, trying
tt to hurry before Libbets
tt returns)
tOne for you and one for me.

He hands a pill to Francis, then pretends to pop one into his
mouth and takes a swig of his beer. As Francis downs his own,
Paul pockets his unswallowed pill.

<b>tttLIBBETS
</b>tt(in the doorway)
tNo candy for me?

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tGroovy.
tt(to Paul)
tYoung master of the revels, a treat

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tWell, uh, I don't, it's really --

</b>tLet's see!

<b>tttPAUL
</b>tt(hand in pocket)
tLibbets, you really shouldn't mix

tI'll put 'em back.

Libbets reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bottle.

<b>tttLIBBETS 
</b>tOh far out, Paulie. Hey look, these
texpired like five months ago. You
tthink they're better aged?

She opens up the bottle and takes one out.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tMaybe you should have just a half.

<b>tttLIBBETS 
</b>tThanks for the advice dad.

She takes the pill.

Paul looks on, thwarted.

<b>INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT
</b>
Ben is back at the bar, pouring another tall one. Mark Boland
sidles up next to him.

<b>tttBOLAND 
</b>tBenjie, feeling no pain.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tAs the Indian saying goes, pain is
tmerely an opinion.

<b>tttBOLAND
</b>tt(nodding across the room)
tHey -- check it out. Maria Conrad's
tbrought her son.
tt(walking off)
tI wish some of the gang had brought
ttheir daughters!

Ben feels a wave of distaste at the joke.

He looks across the room as Maria and her son Neil (stringy
hair, acne, tie-dyed turtleneck, patched jeans) are engaging
Janey and Philip Edwards in conversation.

<b>INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT
</b>
Paul, Francis, and Libbets sit on the floor, listening to the
music blasting at full strength.

Libbets and Francis are obviously on the verge of
unconsciousness. Paul regards them with a look of
apprehension on his face.

<b>INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT
</b>
Neil has now cornered Janey.

<b>tttNEIL 
</b>tAs Werner says, there is nothing to
tget. That's It. When you get that
tthere's nothing to get. That's the
ttraining, when you ask yourself,

</b>tWait, this is the training, where
tthey don't let you go to the

<b>tttNEIL 
</b>tThat was the hardest part. But I
tdid it. And you get into some far
tout shit.

<b>INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT
</b>
Libbets puts a blanket over a sleeping Francis, who's crashed
out on the floor in a corner. Francis alternates between
snores and various mumbled delirious ravings.

<b>tttFRANCIS 
</b>tThe foot... the foot... toeclipper
tman...

Paul is sitting on the couch, and Libbets comes back and sits
at his feet, facing up to him.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tI guess he's just real exhausted
tfrom, you know, tests and stuff.

Libbets is herself somewhat in dreamland.

<b>tttLIBBETS 
</b>tYeah.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tYou know Libbets, I really feel,
tyou know, like a real connection to
tyou --

<b>tttLIBBETS 
</b>tYeah but you don't even know me

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tSure I do, you know, like your

</b>tIt's like very positive, and I feel

<b>tttLIBBETS 
</b>tAnd I have a special feeling too,

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tYou do? I'm glad. Because I feel

</b>tRight. Cool. So, how about we take
ta bath together?

<b>tttLIBBETS
</b>tt(consciousness fading
tt fast)
tHah hah you're funny. A bath. Like
ta brother and sister. Oh man, I'm
tso wasted.

Her head bobs and weaves, her eyes close, and suddenly her
head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch -- smack
dab between Paul's legs.

She begins to snore instantly, her open mouth nuzzling into
his crotch.

Paul doesn't move, doesn't even breathe. Then, slowly, he
leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of
his body.

He looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and
received a lobotomy.

<b>INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT
</b>
The crowd's a bit thinner than before.

As Dot Halford begins calling out for everyone's attention, a
few couples make their last-minute way to the door.

<b>tttDOT 
</b>tOK everyone. We have a little
tbusiness to attend to now. So
teveryone who'd like to stay, please
tgather in the living room.

She scoops up the bowl and places it on a high end table
which has been put in the middle of the room.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tt(walking up to Elena)
tReady to go?

<b>tttELENA
</b>tWe're not going anywhere.

Elena waves at Janey Williams, who is standing across the
living room.

Janey looks back without expression.

<b>INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT
</b>
Libbets and Paul in the same position whence last we saw
them.

Paul delicately leans to one side of the couch and picks up a
phone. He dials a number.

<b>ttttttINTERCUT:
</b>
<b>INT. HOOD LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

The phone rings. Wendy picks it up.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tHood residence.

tCharles, what time is it?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tIs this Charles?

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tWhat time is it?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tUm, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tI'm, uh, in the midst of a moral

</b>tShit. I can't really talk about it.
tI guess I better get to the train.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tRight.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tWhat are you doing at home on a
tFriday night?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tI have plans.

Paul hangs up the phone and looks down at Libbets.

Libbets' Allman Brothers tape has run out. The machine makes
a repeated clicking sound as the take up real continues to
circle. The only other sound is the noise of the wind and
rain lashing against the apartment's windows.

<b>EXT. HOOD HOUSE. NIGHT
</b>
Wendy emerges from the house and gets on her bike, but the
ice makes it too slippery. The storm is now in full swing.
She gets off and walks.

<b>EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</b>
Wendy walks, barely keeping her balance in the wind.

<b>INT. HALFORD'S NIGHT
</b>
All the couples are now gathered for the key selection
process, men on one side of the room, women on the other. The
storm can be heard outside.

<b>tttDOT 
</b>tWell, what shall the order be,
talphabetical? In order of

<b>tttPIERCE SAWYER 
</b>tGolf handicap! Lowest handicap does

Nervous laughter.

</b>tGolf handicap? Ladies, isn't it up
tto you?

<b>tttMARIA CONRAD 
</b>tOh I'll go first, damn it. Let's
tjust line up and get it over with.

Maria chooses Stephen Earle. Hands the keys to him. A
smattering of applause as she takes his arm and they leave.

<b>tttMARIE EARLE 
</b>tGood luck!

Neil watches his mother's exit.

<b>ttttttJUMP CUT TO:
</b>
A few more couplings.

<b>ttttttJUMP CUT TO:
</b>
Helen Worthington approaches the bowl. Helen Worthington has
the size and shape of a sumo wrestler.

There is a nervous shifting of weight on the male side of the
room.

Helen delicately reaches into the bowl. Her hands emerge with
a key chain.

George Clair steps forward, obviously depressed, as a
collective sigh of relief goes up from behind him. Ben looks
on, momentarily triumphant.

Elena smiles to herself.

<b>ttttttJUMP CUT TO:
</b>
The Gadds choose each other.

<b>tttMRS. GADD 
</b>tOh, my own husband. Isn't that
tagainst the rules?

<b>tttDOT 
</b>tTry again?

<b>tttMRS. GADD 
</b>tt(relieved)
tOh, I think not.

Mr. Gadd smiles as they leave, obviously happy to go.

Finally, only Mark Boland, Neil Conrad, Janey and Jim
Williams, Rob and Dot Halford, Sari Steele, Benjamin and
Elena.

<b>tttDOT 
</b>tGetting down to the wire!

Elena steps forward. Benjamin is obviously agitated.

Close on Janey's hands selecting -- away from Ben's equine
key ring.

She lifts up another key ring -- Neil Conrad, the teenager.

She hands the self-important-looking Neil his keys and they
turn to go.

Jim Williams smiles mysteriously to himself.

Ben suddenly lurches forward, semi-drunkenly, trying to
separate Neil from Janey.

<b>tttTHE GROUP
</b>tt(ad lib)
tHey hey Ben, hang on there a sec.

He backs off, ashamed, and, taking a step backwards, trips
over the coffee table.

Mark Boland helps lift him up.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tSorry... maybe I should... the
tbathroom?

<b>tttDOT
</b>tRight down the hall, Ben.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tt(muttering)
tSorry, I'm sorry. Uh, I'll be back.

Dot follows Mark Boland down the hall behind Ben.

Suddenly, it's just Elena and Jim Williams, and Sari Steele
and Rob Halford.

<b>tttROB HALFORD
</b>tt(taking Sari's arm)
tActually, we didn't put our keys in

Elena and Jim look at each other.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tRob, we'll fix it for ourselves.
tYou two go and get acquainted.
tWe'll let ourselves out the front

Jim and Elena stand there alone.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tWell, I have to say I don't have
tmuch faith that my car keys are
tstill in that bowl. Doesn't seem
tentirely safe, leaving your car
tkeys around?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tLet me.

She takes the bowl and dips her hand in. Two sets are left.
One, her own, she avoids. She takes out Jim's keys and walks
across the room, handing them to him.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tThanks, but -- oh, I don't think
tso. It's been kind of a
tdiscouraging evening.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tYou couldn't have hoped for much

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tSomehow it was different in my
timagination when I thought about

tit at all, really.

They sit down on the sofa.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tYou want coffee or something?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tWell, maybe they have one of those
tfilter jobs in the kitchen --

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tLook, Elena, the fact that we're
tneighbors... you know, close
tfriends, well it sort of makes this
ta little strange, don't you think?

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tMy husband is probably passed out
tin the bathroom, or at least he
twishes he were. I've been married
tto him for 17 years and I don't
thave any intention of going in
tthere to get him... so what I'm
tproposing is that since your wife
thas gone off with a boy, and since
tyou are standing here alone, I'm
tproposing that you and I do what
tmakes sense. Stay warm. Pass some
ttime. That's all.

They both look at their hands.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tNow don't make me feel as if I'm
tbeing too forward, OK? If you don't
<b>t--
</b>
<b>tttJIM 
</b>tWhat the hey. Let's go for a drive.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tOkay. Shall we clean up around here
tfirst? Do you think it's all right--

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tNah, that wasn't in the contract.

But they still walk around turning off lights.

In the hallway, Elena looks a bit mournfully at the light
seeping from underneath the bathroom door. She hears the
sound of running water from inside.

Then she goes into a sideroom and joins Jim. They pick up
their coats.

<b>EXT. HALFORD HOUSE. NIGHT
</b>
Elena and Jim walk outside into the freezing, pelting rain.

Covering their faces, they jog to his car, an oversized
Cadillac. A thick glaze of ice forms on his windshield.

<b>INT. JIM'S CADILLAC. NIGHT
</b>
They climb in.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tWe're going to have to defrost this
tthing for a while.

He turns on the ignition, and the vents start to blow cold
air at them.

He leans over and kisses her.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tDo these seats go back?

That starts it. He jumps at her, unbuckling her and unzipping
himself.

They tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds. And then,
comically, he's in her.

With a groan, it's over in a flash.

Jim pulls himself off, readjusting his pants.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tThat was awful, really awful. I'm
tso sorry, Elena.

Elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove
compartment, and is trying to figure out how to extricate
herself.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tThings are really rotten at home.
tYou wouldn't believe how rotten.
tJaney's sick. She's unstable, I
tguess... it's not the right time to

tlike I can't make her happy, the
tboys can't make her happy, she just
tdoesn't --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tJim, maybe we should just go. I've

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tJesus, let me make it up to you --

</b>tOf course.

She opens the door and walks back to the house.

<b>INT. HALFORD'S. CONT'D

She opens the door. Ben's sitting on the floor, next to the
toilet, woozily flipping through the pages of a magazine.

He sits, accepting and quiet.

pushes on it, and lets herself in.

Wendy wanders into the living room, then climbs the steps.
The sound of the wind and the darkness begin to scare her.

She goes into Mikey's room -- it's even more of a disaster
zone than usual.

She sees on the wall his dark-light poster of the 12 (sexual)
positions of the zodiac.

She notices the black garter belt on the floor, and picks it
up, absentmindedly swinging it in her hand as she walks out
of the room.

She walks back down the stairs and into the kitchen, leaving
the garter belt on the counter.

She opens the refrigerator, grabs a jar of peanut butter, and
scoops some up in her finger. As she puts her finger in her
mouth --

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tWendy.

She gives out a little yelp.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tSandy, you scared the shit out of
tme.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tWhat are you doing?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tJust thought I'd stop by.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tMike's out -- I think he went to
tSilver Meadow to see if you were
thanging around there.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tYeah.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tt(pause)
tAre you his girlfriend?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tNo.

<b>INT. JIM'S CADILLAC. NIGHT
</b>
Elena gets in. They drive off silently.

<b>EXT. STREETS. NIGHT
</b>
The car moves haltingly through the sleet and ice, inches up
a hill, then falters and slides back silently, circling a
couple of times before crashing into an embankment.

<b>INT. CAR. NIGHT
</b>
As the car slides and crashes amid Jim's and Elena's screams.

Silence.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tYou okay?

<b>tttELENA
</b>tYeah. You?

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tYes. Well, I guess we can walk from
there.

<b>EXT. CAR. NIGHT
</b>
Jim and Elena get out, shaky, from the car.

They pause for a moment.

The street lamp above them sizzles, but stays on.

They start to walk.

<b>INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT
</b>
Paul and Libbets, still frozen in the same position. Finally,
Paul gently pushes Libbets' head back.

It slides off his leg and, as Paul lurches forward in a
failed attempt to grab it, Libbets flops backwards, her head
hitting the carpet with a dull but decidedly loud thump.

<b>tttPAUL
</b>tOh shit!

Paul gets up, looks down at her.

She snores.

He runs over to a side table and sees the clock: 11:10.

<b>tttPAUL (CONT'D)
</b>tOh shit oh shit.

He grabs his comic books and runs for the door.

<b>INT. TAXI. NIGHT
</b>
The driver impassively inches down Park Avenue.

<b>tttPAUL 
</b>tOh shit oh shit. C'mon!

<b>INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM. NIGHT
</b>
Paul sprints down the platform just as the doors are closing.
He barely makes it into the train.

<b>INT. TRAIN. NIGHT
</b>
Paul walks through the nearly empty train car and finds a
seat. He pulls his Fantastic Four comic book out of his coat
pocket.

<b>INT. HALFORD KITCHEN. NIGHT
</b>
Ben makes his way to the kitchen, pours himself a cup of
coffee.

He sees himself reflected in the black glass of the cabinets.

<b>INT. SANDY'S ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
Sandy and Wendy are sitting on the floor. He grabs his G.I.
Joe.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tCheck this out. He's supposed to
ttalk all kinds of stuff, but he's
tlike malfunctioned.

He pulls the dog tag on the doll, and G.I. Joe emits a
plastic macho voice.

<b>tttG.I. JOE 
</b>tMayday! Mayday! Get this message
tback to base!

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tSame thing. Again and again.

Wendy takes the doll and yanks the cord.

<b>tttG.I. JOE 
</b>tMayday! Mayday! Get this message
tback to base!

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tIt's gonna get a lot colder
ttonight, I predict. Probably a
tblackout. Do you have candles in
tyour house?
tI know where the candles are, and I
thave my own flashlight. Over there.
tAlso, I know where every emergency
texit is on this floor.

During the course of his monologue, as Wendy looks on, Sandy
calmly ties a noose for his doll.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tThis knot's called a bowline.

He puts the noose over the doll's head, as Wendy holds him.

<b>tttG.I. JOE 
</b>tMayday! Mayday!

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tLet's hang him.

Sandy drapes the noose over the edge of a dresser drawer.
G.I. Joe dangles. They both look at him in silence.

The silence continues.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tHe's dead.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tIf it wasn't raining we could take
thim outside and blow him up.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tHe wouldn't blow up. He'd just get
tall mangled or twisted.

She takes him down and lays him flat on the bed. And then
begins to remove his clothes.

Sandy looks on, desirous.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tWell.
tt(noticing his lack of
tt anatomy) 
tIt looks like someone got to his
tprivate parts before us.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tCommunist Viet Cong.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tThey left it in the jungle.

They speak with high seriousness.

Wendy slides up on the bed where Sandy sits, a pillow on his
lap, and one by one, with exaggerated slowness, she removes
her snowboots, as if they were stiletto heels.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tCan I get into your bed? 
tt(pause)
tWith you?

Sandy begins to shake.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tWe -- we have to go to the guest
troom. We can't stay in here. What
tif Mikey? My parents?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tDon't worry about them. They're at
tthat party, getting drunk and
tfalling all over each other and
tmaking jokes about McGovern and
tstuff.

Sandy begins to cry.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tIt's just -- it's just --

She takes his hand, and they walk out of the room and down
the hall, into the guest room.

<b>INT. GUEST ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
Wendy and Sandy enter. She sees the vodka bottle on the
dresser.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tWant a drink?

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tVodka?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tYou never tasted the stuff?

She fills the glass to the brim and hands the bottle to
Sandy.

They clink and each toss back a sip -- Wendy almost the
entire glass.

Sandy coughs and gags, but swallows.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tTry again.

He does.

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tIt feels warm.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tOne more shot?

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tOkay.

They drink.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tUnder the covers.

Under they go, and soon every layer of clothing emerges.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tt(feeling her way)
tGet 'em off.

Sandy begins to laugh, and soon Wendy joins him.

They roll around on top of each other for a while.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tHave you ever had a nocturnal
temission?

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tHuh?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tThat's the name for when you wake
tup and find this little pool of
tsticky stuff, like after a sexy
tdream.

Sandy shakes his head.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tThey didn't tell you this stuff
tyet? What planet do you live on?

Sandy doesn't answer, but climbs back on top of her and
kisses her neck.

<b>tttSANDY
</b>tI love you.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tThat's nice. Are you drunk?

<b>tttSANDY 
</b>tI don't know. How do I know?

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tI don't know either. You spin
taround, when you lie down.

Sandy rolls off her and lies on his back.

<b>tttSANDY (CONT'D)
</b>tI don't think I'm spinning.

They cuddle up together.

He yawns. She yawns.

<b>EXT. SILVER MEADOW. NIGHT
</b>
Mikey walks along the edge of the empty pool in the rain. He
climbs up on the diving board and bounces lightly on it, but
then gets off and stands, looking down at the pool again.

<b>EXT. SILVER MEADOW. NIGHT
</b>
Mikey walks across the field.

<b>EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</b>
The storm has let up. Mikey walks along. With a running
start, he slides on the ice down a hill.

He walks back up and slides again, hollering with joy. He is
an image of a tiny yet absolute and positive freedom.

The streetlights sputter on, then off.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. NIGHT
</b>
Sandy and Wendy lie asleep.

<b>EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</b>
A power line is down. It hisses and HUMS -- a humming very
much like the humming Mikey has been hearing earlier.

The humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which
Mikey has become so accustomed at such moments.

Mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail, to ponder the
sound and the snaking coil of electricity.

A strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face,
as the power line connects to the guardrail.

<b>tttMIKEY 
</b>tOh shit.

Glued by an electrical pulse to the rail, he shakes as the
current flows through him.

After a minute, his body slumps and slides down the road.

<b>INT. TRAIN. NIGHT
</b>
As Paul sits reading on he moving train, the lights inside
begin to sputter, and the train begins to slow. After a few
moments, the train grinds to a halt, and Paul and his few
fellow late night passengers are left in near total dark,
with only the light of an emergency exit sign above Paul's
head to light the scene.

The train is eerily silent.

<b>EXT. HOOD CAR. NIGHT
</b>
Ben drives home.

<b>EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</b>
An emergency vehicle, lights flashing, crawls by Ben's car.
He drives on slowly.

<b>EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF WILLIAMS HOUSE. PRE-DAWN
</b>
Jim and Elena arrive on foot.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tYou want to come in, get a cup of
tcoffee -- warm up? I can either
twalk you home, or you could crash
tin the guest room.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tSure. Maybe coffee.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. PRE-DAWN
</b>
<b>tttJIM 
</b>tPhone's out. I hope the pipe's --

He walks into the kitchen. The pipes have begun to burst.
There's a water leak running down the walls, forming a puddle
on the floor.

Elena has walked into the kitchen behind him. She leans
against the counter, picking up the garter belt without
thinking for a second, then putting it back down.

<b>tttJIM 
</b>tOh well. Why don't you put on some
tdry socks -- and we've got some
train boots in the guest closet back
tthere. Last room upstairs -- back
tof the hall.

Elena climbs the stairs in her bare feet.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. CONT'D
</b>
Elena opens the door, and discovers Wendy and Sandy asleep.
She stands before the bed, and gazes down on them.

They look almost angelic.

Wendy, sensing her presence in the room, opens her eyes,
slowly coming out of sleep.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tt(heartbroken, softly)
tGet dressed.

Elena walks out of the room, back to the kitchen.

Wendy gets out of bed quietly, leaving Sandy sleeping
peacefully.

She looks at him lovingly, and tucks the blanket back up
around him.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. DAWN
</b>
Elena and Jim are drinking coffee.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tYou should let him sleep.

Wendy enters. She looks inquisitively at the two adults.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tWhere's dad?

<b>INT. HOOD CAR. DAWN
</b>
Ben continues to drive slowly. He looks out his side window,
and sees something. He puts on his brakes.

<b>EXT. STREET. DAWN
</b>
Ben gets out of the car, and stands on the top of an icy
embankment. In a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a
parka.

He walks hesitantly toward it. Mike's body lies face down in
the wet ice.

Ben leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in
amazement and saddened shock.

He stands there for a moment, then picks Mike's body up,
carrying him over the hill and onto the street. We see now
that he is parked just a short block from the Williams's
house.

He bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward
the house. The effort is obviously enormous. He falls from
time to time, then gets back up.

<b>INT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN
</b>
Various passengers asleep.

Paul, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit
light, cold. He reads his comic book by the light of the
emergency exit.
<b>t"DON'T YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO
</b><b>tPOWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD
</b><b>tCONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE
</b><b>tDESTROYED THE WORLD!"
</b>
Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the
train's engines returns.

The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic
nasal train conductor voice.

<b>tttCONDUCTOR
</b>tGood morning ladies and gentlemen --

On Paul, squinting in the harsh light.

<b>EXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN
</b>
The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested
landscape. On the street below the bridge, an emergency
highway crew is removing a fallen tree, their trucks aglow in
flashing yellow lights.

<b>INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. DAWN
</b>
Elena pours Wendy a cup of coffee. They're both in their
coats.

<b>tttWENDY
</b>tI don't like coffee.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tIt'll warm you up.

Elena sits next to her. They both raise their cups and sip
the coffee, not noticing the simultaneity of their movements.

<b>INT. GUEST ROOM. DAWN
</b>
Jim watches the sleeping Sandy, picks up the half-empty
bottle of vodka, pours himself a drink. The noise wakes Sandy
up. Jim sits down on the bed at his feet and takes a sip.

<b>tttSANDY
</b>tDad?

Jim looks at him.

<b>INT. KITCHEN. DAWN
</b>
Elena and Wendy hear a hollering from outside, get up to see
what it is.

<b>EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. DAWN
</b>
Elena and Wendy come out the front door, as Ben lays Mikey's
body onto the ground before the front steps.

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tBen?

He's too breathless to speak.

They stand there, looking down at Mikey.

Behind Elena and Wendy, Jim appears.

He pushes softly by them toward the body of his son.

<b>tttBEN
</b>tJim -- he was just up --  in Silver
tLane -- I think maybe -- a power
tline --

Jim picks up his son.

He carries him silently into the house.

Sandy, now standing inside the foyer, pushes himself back
against the wall as they pass, without expression.

After a moment, from outside, the Hoods can hear Jim's
wailing.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tDo you think? Maybe we should call
tsomeone --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tThe phone's out.

<b>tttBEN (CONT'D)
</b>tYeah. Well, we can just --

<b>tttELENA 
</b>tBen, I don't think he wants us
there.

Wendy has been watching Sandy through the screen door.

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tWait, I --

She turns back up the front steps and gently goes in --

<b>INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. CONT'D
</b>
on the living room floor, Jim is hugging Mike's body, his
shoulders shaking uncontrollably, sobbing.

Wendy walks and stands next to Sandy, who is filled
momentarily with a brief inexplicable rush of anger toward
her -- but she takes him and gives him an awkward, childlike
hug, then turns and runs out the door, joining Ben and Elena
on the driveway. Sandy watches her go, his face wet with
tears.

<b>EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. CONT'D
</b>
<b>tttELENA 
</b>tOh you know, for a minute I thought
tit was --

<b>tttBEN
</b>tPaul? Yeah. You think --

<b>tttWENDY 
</b>tHe's probably been waiting all
tnight at the station.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tC'mon.

<b>EXT. STREET. DAWN
</b>
Elena, Wendy, and Ben reach the car and get in. The car
starts and drives off.

There are more crews out cleaning up the storm's debris and
fixing the power lines as they drive.

<b>EXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING
</b>
The train slowly pulls in. The Hood family walks down to the
end of the platform.

The train doors open, and Paul, tired and a bit cramped,
emerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the
platform, and walks to them.

They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.

When he joins them they all walk silently to the car and get
in.

<b>INT. HOOD CAR. EARLY MORNING
</b>
Sunlight floods in and temporarily blinds Ben as he starts
the engine.

He squints, his eyes tearing a bit from the light.

He looks around, first at his wife, then at his two children
sitting in the back seat.

He turns off the engine. Quietly, he begins to cry.

He turns to the back seat.

<b>tttBEN 
</b>tThere's something -- your mother
tand I -- have to tell you two --

Elena puts her hand out, almost touching him.

<b>tttELENA
</b>tt(softly)
tBen.

Paul looks at Wendy, silently asking her what's happening.

She casts her eyes downward, as does he.

<b>tttELENA (CONT'D)
</b>tt(her hand still not yet
tt touching him)
tBen.

<b>EXT. STATION PARKING LOT. MORNING
</b>
From above:

The car, the first morning light shining upon it.
