<b>tEXT. WALL STREET - EARLY MORNING
</b>
tFADE IN. THE STREET. The most famous third of a mile in the
tworld. Towering landmark structures nearly blot out the
tdreary grey flannel sky. The morning rush hour crowds swarm
tthrough the dark, narrow streets like mice in a maze, all in
tpursuit of one thing: MONEY... CREDITS RUN.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
tWe hear the ROAR of the trains pulling out of the station.
tBlurred faces, bodies, suits, hats, attache cases float into
tview pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which
tnow open, releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed,
tone of them BUD FOX.

<b>tEXT. SUBWAY EXIT - MORNING
</b>
tThe bubbling mass charges up the stairs. Steam rises from a
tgrating, shapes merging into the crowd. Past the HOMELESS
tVETS, the insane BAG LADY with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags
thuddled in the corner of Trinity Church...

tBud the Fox straggling behind, in a crumpled raincoat, tie
taskew, young, very young, his bleary face buried in a Wall
tStreet Journal, folded, 'subway style', as he crosses the
tstreet against the light.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttWhy Fox? Why didn't you buy...
ttschmuck?

tA car honks, swerving past.

<b>tINT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</b>
tCavernous modern lobby. Bodies cramming into elevators. Bud,
tstuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.

<b>tINT. ELEVATOR - MORNING
</b>
tBlank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, Bud
tagain mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes
tcatching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away.
tParanoia in the elevator. We quickly cut into private lives.

<b>ttttWORRIED MAN (V.O.)
</b>tt... he'll sue me, could be for 5-6
ttmillion, and he'll get a million,
ttthe house, they'll impound my
ttpaychecks...damn, damn, why did I
ttsign that contract?

<b>ttttBLACK BIKE MESSENGER (V.O.)
</b>tt... gotta get Lola in the sack man,
tttake her to the Garden for the
ttTerrells, Jimmy give me the tickets
ttfor 12 bucks, I pull the midnight
ttshift, I could do 60 bucks... wow,
ttcheck those legs out...

tHis eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away, self-
tconscious about her legs. The elevator stops at a floor,
tdiscards only one person. The doors close a little too slowly.

<b>ttttBLONDE EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
</b>tt... jerk...
ttt(shifts her thoughts)
ttcall Hanratty. The decimal points
tton the code are uncalibrated.
ttHoskins. The signatures on the bank
ttdraft. Boyle, that
ttbitch...insurance...tax form. Shit,
tttalk to Kahn.
ttt(recalling)
ttThat's Hanratty, Hoskins, Bank,
ttBoyle and Kahn... H2B2K - shoot,
ttinsurance and theatre
tttix...H2B2K,I,T -- and the cleaners!
ttrepeat...

tCatching the eyes of Bud Fox once again wandering to her.
tCamera moving to Bud who looks away.

<b>ttttBUD (V.O.)
</b>tt...sorry, what a fox... funny, the
ttmost beautiful girls in the world
ttare always on the street or in
ttelevators, never get to talk to
ttthem, shy ... my looks, never had
ttconfidence in them ...
ttovercompensating work syndrome...
ttprove your worth with money...
tt'cept I'm not making any money...
ttt(pause, the elevator
tttat another floor, slow)
tt... wonder what all these people
ttare thinking about.

tCamera moving slowly again over the eyes. The silence of
tindividual tension reigns over all.

<b>ttttANGRY MAN (V.O.)
</b>tt...Screw him! I'll destroy that
ttsonufabitch... he thinks he can
ttbreak a contract with me he's got
ttsomething to learn.

<b>ttttSECRETARY (V.O.)
</b>tt...9:15!... he'll kill me this
tttime, he will really kill me... oh
ttcome on elevator!... why do you
ttstop on every floor...

tAs the elevator stops again to disgorge two people.

<b>ttttBIKE MESSENGER (V.O.)
</b>ttt(pissed now at the elevator)
tt... come on man, time is money
ttman... One floor here I could do
tteleven blocks...

<b>ttttBLONDE EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
</b><b>ttH2B2K,I,T,CL,P,O,T2...
</b>ttt(pause, she looks
tttlike she forgot something)


<b>ttttWORRIED MAN (V.O.)
</b>tt...goddamn elevators!...people, too
ttmany goddamn people in this world!

tThe elevator finally comes to a slow stop... They wait,
tplead, beg, screech with the eyes.

tThe door at last opens. None of them acknowledging each
tother, they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp
tof release, a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal
tafter a punishing wait...

tThe elevator tension is over, but the killer grind continues.

<b>tINT. JACKSON, STEINEM INVESTMENT HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tCredits continue to run. Bud moves past the functional
treception area, past CAROLYN, a cheerful young black girl.

<b>ttttCAROLYN
</b>ttHow you doing Buddy?

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttGreat Carolyn, doing any better
ttwould be a sin...

tHe slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his Paul
tStuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room.

tBrokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the
tpapers, the quotrons. The digital clock by the big board
tcounter clicks to 9:26 am -- four minutes until the market
topens. You can smell the hunger.

tBud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and
tstruts into the office -- fuck it -- it's a new day.

tMOVING past DAN STEEPLES, a flush-faced old-timer, a blue
tand white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttMorning, Dan. What's looking good
tttoday?

<b>ttttSTEEPLES
</b>ttIf I know I wouldn't be in this
ttbusiness. Get out while you're
ttyoung, kid. I came here one day, I
ttsat down, and look at me now.

tPast CHARLIE CUSHING, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man
twith rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>tt...hey Chuckie, how's the woman-
ttslayer?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...still looking for the right 18
ttyear old wife, how you doing, pal?

<b>ttttBUD
</b>tt...if I had your looks, better.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(used to it)
tt...takes years of genetics, pal,
ttand a Yale education... and the
ttright tailor.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>tt...not that you learned anything,
ttChunk.

tBud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and
tpulls out a computer print-out of last night's homework.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttI gotta feeling we're going to make
tta killing today, Marv.

<b>ttttMARV (O.S.)
</b>ttYeah, where's your machine gun.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttJoke about it. I was up all night
ttcharting these stocks. You want to
ttsee this or what?

tHis associate, MARVIN, a manicky wise-guy, swivels over his
tchair from a nearby desk. He gives the charts a quick read.

<b>ttttMARV
</b>ttt(scowling)
ttLooks bearish to me, buddy. You got
ttit all upside down.
ttt(confidential)
ttOkay, I'm giving this to you and
ttyou alone, 'cause I feel sorry for
ttyou. Take the Knicks against the
ttBullets, and my pick of the day --
ttDuke to beat the spread against
ttWake Forest.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttThanks, Marv, with that I might be
ttable to qualify for welfare.

tLOU MANNHEIM, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker
tin his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button
tdown white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from
tanother era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously
tailing in the legs and breath department.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttt(friendly)
ttYou got a look in your eye, Mr.
ttMannheim... You got something for
ttthe small fry...

<b>ttttMANNHEIM
</b>ttJesus, can't make a buck in this
ttmarket, country's going to hell
ttfaster than when that sonofabitch
ttRoosevelt was around... too much
ttcheap money sloshing around the
ttworld. The biggest mistake we ever
ttmade was letting Nixon get off the
ttgold standard. Putney Drug--you
ttboys might want to have a look at it.

<b>ttttMARV
</b>ttTake 5 years for that company to
ttturn around.

<b>ttttMANNHEIM
</b>tt...but they got a good new drug.
ttStick to the fundamentals, that's
tthow IBM and Hilton were built...good
ttthings sometimes take time.

tThe stentorian voice of OFFICE MANAGER HIERONYMUS LYNCH
tbooms over the intercom.

tWe see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit
toffice; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his
tface.

<b>ttttLYNCH
</b>ttAttention. Please. Office Production
ttis down ten percent this week. I
ttrecommend that you all go through
ttyour clients' investments for any
ttportfolio adjustments. And don't
ttforget -- double commissions today
tton our 'A' or better bond funds.
ttt(looking in Bud and
tttMarv's direction)
ttEspecially you rookies. Also,
ttremember, the sales contest ends
tttomorrow.

tBud and Marvin roll their eyes. The digital clock flashes
t9:30. The CREDITS close.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttAnd they're off and running!

tThe room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the
tclatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines,
tnewsprinters' Dow Jones and Reuters, phones ringing off the
thook. Brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets,
tdodging each other; it's a controlled riot.

<b>ttttBROKERS
</b>ttHere's a hot lead... Have I got one
ttfor you.... sell ... dump it all!!
tt... 500 at an eighth, an eighth!...
ttJuly fifties. April thirties...how
ttbout those Decembers? You see where
ttthey're going? ... Morgan is
ttselling a billion one at the close.
ttYeah. That's right, they're selling
ttall over the place... we're still
ttlong on the treasuries -- $110
ttmillion. What about the Japs?
tt...Where am I?
ttt(confused at all the
tttphone lights)
ttWe gotta lot of lights here! Let's
ttpick 'em up.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttt(on phone)
ttJack, take 50 Gulf, with a 3/8 top,
ttforget the hundred. What about
ttDelroy? I can go long at 23, let's
ttgo long...Conwest Air -- let me
ttcheck it...

tHe looks up at the TICKER... stock quotes whizzing by.

<b>ttttBUD (O.S. CONT'D)
</b>ttUp an eighth. How many you want?
ttIt's on the floor.

tHe writes the order up.

tA shot of CHARLIE CUSHING yawning as he half-listens to his
tcustomer, resting the phone on his kneecaps.

tTHE CLOCK... It's 2.30 p.m. We hear the relentless clatter
tof the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices,
tblarihg market information out of squawk boxes.

tBud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature,
tcrumpled notes, beverage cups and a half-eaten sandwich.
tHe's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller
ton the other end is breaking his balls. Marvin paces past,
tmaking a dramatic phone pitch.

<b>ttttMARV
</b>ttDr. Beltzer has to have his
ttinformation this minute! It
ttconcerns his future!

tBud waves Marvin away, answers his caller, trying to keep
tcool, worried how as he sees Lynch, the office manager,
tcoming over.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttHey Howard, I thought you were a
ttgentleman. Sure it's gone down a
ttlittle bit, but you got the tip
ttfrom your printer, I didn't... Yeah

ttNo, I can't give it back! Give it

ttt(beat)
ttNo, he's out right now.

tAs he looks up and winks at Lynch, standing over him.

</b>ttt(cupping the receiver)
tt... That's what you told us to say.

</b>ttGive me that phone.

ttYes, sir, this is the manager. What
ttseems to be the problem?

<b>ttttMARV
</b>ttt(into his phone)
ttWhat?... Well, how was I to know
ttyou were in surgery? What am I
ttMarvin the mind reader here?

tBud whispers, tensely. Lynch listens.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttHe's lying.

<b>ttttLYNCH
</b>ttOkay, sir. I'll discuss this with
ttthe broker and I'll get back to you.
ttYou're welcome.

tLynce hangs up and glares at Bud.

</b>ttIf I'm closing out this account. If
tthe doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you
ttpay for it.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttMr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!

</b>ttFox, you're making more problems
ttthan you are sales.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttI don't think you're being fair,

ttyou know he's got a history...

<b>ttttLYNCH
</b>ttSomebody has to pay for that error.
ttAnd it's not me.

tLynch walks off. Bud does some quick calculations in his head.

<b>ttttMARV
</b>ttt(reappearing)
ttBuddy, buddy, buddy; little
tttrouble, huh, today.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttt(devastated)
ttHoward the Jerk reneged on me. I've

tHe takes out his wallet and loans Bud a hundred bucks.

</b>ttThanks Marv, I'll make it good to

</b>ttJust put me on the institutional

tMarvin points up at the clock. Bud looks up... it's 2:40.
tBud quickly composes himself. He picks up the phone, dialing
tpurposefully.

<b>ttttMARV (CONT'D)
</b>ttBuddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize
ttit's big game hunters that bag the
ttelephants, not retail brokers. I

ttstocks short.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttHello, Natalie -- guess who? That's

<b>tINT. GEKKO OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tNATALIE, a classy attractive Englishwoman is on the phone
twith Bud, somewhat amused by his manner. She is the personal
tsecretary to multimillionaire, Wall Street trader and
traider, Gordon Gekko. His windows look out on a panoramic
tview of the city and East River.

<b>ttttNATALIE
</b>ttMr. Fox, I've told you before, I'm

ttGekko only deals with investment
ttbankers. Yes, I shall give him your
ttmessage ...

tAs they're speaking, another SECRETARY leads two well-heeled
tJAPANESE BUSINESSMEN past her desk. As she opens the door to
tthe inner office and ushers them inside, we catch a glimpse
tof a figure, pacing back and forth, talking animatedly on
tthe phone by the huge corner window. HE IS GORDON GEKKO. We
thear a deafening ROAR as we:

</b>
tIn the background, a 747 ascends into the night sky,
tclimbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses.
tBud, coat collar pulled up against the wind, crosses the
tstreet, entering a neighborhood bar. We see an old maroon
tHonda behind him.

<b>tINT. MCGREGOR'S - TWILIGHT
</b>
tDimly-lit, noisy, blue-collar airline bar. Machinists and
tmechanics still in their overalls at the bar, drinking,
twatching ESPN FIGHT NIGHT, on TV. Bud searches the crowd. A
tgroup of middle-aged men wave him over, BLUESTAR AIRLINES
tinsignias on the pockets... CHARLIE DENT, a rugged, chain-
tsmoking ex-Marine Sergeant, and DOMINICK AMATO, a big strong
tItalian greet Buddy as he comes over.

tHe has a genuine affection and pride in his somewhat
tglamorous son.

tthe restlessness of a caged tiger, a 50-foot extension cord

tHe is carrying on overlapping conversations with a myriad of
tbankers, partners and lawyers; pausing to issue commands to

tacross a bank of quotron monitors, carrying everything from
tNew York Exchanges to London, commodities, gold, and

tcould possibly be doing out at night in public alone.

tback to the bar to order. As he gets the bartender's

tlooks as if he stepped out of the pages of GQ. Together they

tDark mahagony wood, plush banquettes, a long oak bar. Bud
tenters the main dining room in a relatively outre suit that
thangs on him embarrassingly as other businessmen in well-cut
tsuits move around him and a Maitre d' sniffs, then leads him
tto where Gekko is parked, finishing up his lunch. A half

tBud's hands clamped over his eyes. The numbers stop. Noise
trecedes. He opens his eyes, looks down at his desk, stacked

taround the court, as if punishing him, the kid exhausted but
tthe ball's never quite out of reach -- till Bud finally
tcan't take it anymore and at the end of his breath, smashes
tinto the wall and collapses. Gekko laughs. Bud lying there
tlike a sad dog as Gekka hauls him up.

tthe scruffy Exchange Floor, as he weaves through a crush of

</b>
tGordon enters a den lined with old books hunting prints;  he
tproudly picks up something from his gun collection.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttRarest pistol in the world, Larry,
tta .45 Luger. Only six were ever
ttmanufactured.

<b>ttttWILDMAN
</b>ttCongratulations but rarer still is
ttyour interest in Anacott Steel.

</b>ttThe same interest as yours Larry.
ttMoney. I thought it'd be a good
ttinvestment for my kid...

<b>ttttWILDMAN
</b>ttNo. This time I'm in for the long

ttGordon. I'm going to turn it around.
ttYou're getting a free ride on my
tttail, mate, and with the dollars
ttyou're costing me to buy back the
ttstock, I could modernize the plant.
ttI'm not the only one who pays here
ttGordon. We're talking about lives
ttand jobs; three and four generations
ttof steel workers...

tA strong hint of the cockney working class east and London
tboy whiffing through his speech and manner. The "mate" is
ttough and to the point but not insulting...

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttt(has to smile)
ttYou must be wearing a mask you're

ttLet's cut the "sir" crap. Correct

tBud watching this drama unfold. Gekko is about to blow,
tcontrols it.

ttwatching you and your giant ego try
ttto make a horserace out of it...
ttt(turns to Bud)
ttWhat do you think is a fair price
ttfor our stock Bud?

tBud in the spotlight. The eyes all shift to him -- his
tmoment. After an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber --
tand ruthless as his mentor.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttThe break up value is higher. It's
ttworth 80.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttBut we don't want to be greedy now,
ttso let's let him have it at $72.

tHis eyes to Wildman who looks at him, cold, icy mean.

<b>ttttWILDMAN
</b>ttYou're a two bit pirate and a
ttgreen-mailer, Gekko, nothing more...
ttnot only would you sell your mother
ttto make a deal, you'd send her COD...

tBud looking sharply as Gekko's eyes flare with hot white anger.

<b>ttttGEKKO

tHe rises and exits.

tGekko stops at the door, a beat.

</b>ttConsidering you brought my mother
ttinto it, $71.50.

</b>ttDone. You'll hear from my lawyers.
tt8 a.m. Good night.

tHe walks out with the silent lawyer. Past Gekko who watches.
t"Ta Ta".

ttHe's right. I had to sell. The key

tThe sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up

tBud comes out of the building and starts walking away. As he
tpasses the freight entrance, Bud abruptly notices a van
tmarked MARSALA MAINTENENCE COMPANY. He looks back, thinks
tfor a moment: a look in his eyes.

tBud smiles, ready with his spiel.

tAn elevator opens. A body steps out. A set of keys. Boom up
tpast a clipboard and pen to a shirt pocket with MARSALA
tMAINTENANCE written on it, up to Bud dressed in janitorial
tclothing.

tWe move with him to the CREW SUPERVISOR who introduces THREE
tCLEANING WOMEN who nervously absorb Bud, worried for their
tjobs.

tBud strolls from office to office, looking official,
toverseeing his crew, making notations on a checklist.

tBud slips into the Senior Partners' office, thumbs through a
tcalendar on the desk. Sees the list of people, moves to the
tcomputer, punches the client's name in. The code number
tcomes up.

tBud nods to a SECURITY GUARD down the hall and enters the
tfile room where he looks at the Cleaning Lady and points to
this watch. As she exits, he scrambles nervously through the
tfiles -- finds the code number -- then anxiously flips the
tpages to the critical tender offer document -- with the
ttarget name -- INVESTMENT IN RORKER ELECTRONICS CORP. It's
tstamped "DRAFT" across the page. His face lights up. The

<b>tINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe annual Teldar Paper stockholders' meeting is in session:
t400 stockholders are there -- many middle aged and older,
tone bag lady. Cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the
tfront of the room surrounded by an army of bulky EXECUTIVES,
tnone of them weighing less than 200 pounds, ACCOUNTANTS and
tLAWYERS. Gekko in contrast seems like Robin Hood seated with
tAlex, Harold, Bud and the other stockholders. Cromwell is
tdelivering his prepared attack on Gekko in a highly
tsarcastic, gruff manner.

<b>ttttCROMWELL
</b>tt...Your company, ladies and

ttTeldar Paper is now leveraged to
ttthe hilt, like some piss poor South

ttis to get paid to withdraw his

ttapproximately another $200 million
ttin greenmail which will be passed
tton to the consumer...

tGekko seething, jumps up.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttWhere do you get off speaking about

</b>ttSit down, sir, you're out of order,
tthaven't you done enough damage to
ttTeldar as it is?...have you no
ttsense of decency?
ttt(to shareholders)
ttHow can your management...

tGekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various
tcatcalls, "Let the man speak!" "Sit down, Gekko!"

<b>ttttCROMWELL (CONT'D)
</b>tt...concentrate on long term growth
ttwhen we're busy fighting the get-
ttrich-quick, short term profit, slot
ttmachine mentality of Wall Street
ttwhen we should be fighting Japan!
ttThe original fundamental reason for
ttWall Street was to capitalize
ttAmerican business, underwrite new
ttbusiness, build companies, build
ttAmerica. The "deal" has now
ttsucceeded goods and services as
ttAmerica's gross national product
ttand in the process, we are
ttundermining our foundation. This
ttcancer is called "greed". Greed and
ttspeculation have replaced long-term
ttinvestment. Corporations are being
tttaken apart like erector sets,
ttwithout any consideration of the
ttpublic good. I strongly recommend
ttyou to see through Mr. Gekko's
ttshameless intention here to
ttstrip this company and severely
ttpenalize the stockholders. I
ttstrongly recommend you to reject
tthis tender by voting for
ttmanagement's restructuring of the
ttstock.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
tGekko is now at floor level with a microphone. He's calmer,
tmakes his pitch to the stockholders, looking up at the
tmanagement.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>tt...I appreciate the chance you're

ttsingle largest stockholder in
ttTeldar, to speak.
ttt(gets some laughter
tttand applause, loosens)
ttOn the way here today I saw a
ttbumper sticker. It said, "Life is a
ttbitch... then you die".
ttt(gets another laugh)
tt...well ladies and gentlemen, we're
ttnot here to indulge in fantasies,
ttbut in political and economic
ttreality. America has become a
ttsecond rate power. Our trade
ttdeficit and fiscal deficit are at
ttnightmare proportions. In the days
ttof the 'free market' when our
ttcountry was a top industrial power,
ttthere was accountability to the
ttshareholders. The Carnegies, the
ttMellons, the man who built this
ttindustrial empire, made sure of it
ttbecause it was their money at stake.
ttToday management has no stake in
ttthe company. Altogether these guys
ttsitting up there own a total of
ttless than 3% and where does Mr.
ttCromwell put his million dollar
ttsalary? Certainly not in Teldar

ttlunches, golf and hunting trips,
ttcorporate jets, and golden
ttparachutes! Teldar Paper has 33

</b>ttOne thing I do know is this paper
ttcompany lost $110 million last
ttyear, and I'd bet half of that is
ttin the paperwork going back and
ttforth between all the vice
ttpresidents...
ttt(increased laughter,
ttthe's getting them)
ttThe new law of evolution in
ttcorporate America seems to be
tt'survival of the unfittest'. Well
ttin my book, you either do it right
ttor you get eliminated. Teldar Paper
ttis doomed to fail. Its
ttdiversification into casualty
ttinsurance has not worked. Its crown
ttjewels are its trees, the rest is
ttdross. Through wars, depressions,
ttinflations and deterioration of
ttpaper money, trees have always kept
tttheir value, but Teldar is chopping
ttthem all down. Forests are
ttperishable, forest rights are as
ttimportant as human rights to this
ttplanet, and all the illusory
ttMaginot lines, scorched earth
tttactics, proxy fights, poison
ttpills, etc. that Mr.
ttCromwell is going to come up with
ttto prevent people like me from
ttbuying Teldar Paper are doomed to
ttfail because the bottom line,
ttladies and gentlemen, as you very
ttwell know, is the only way to stay
ttstrong is to create value, that's
ttwhy you buy stock, to have it go up.
ttIf there's any other reason, I've
ttnever hear it.
ttt(laughter)
ttThat's all I'm saying...it's you
ttpeople who own this company, not
ttthem, they work for you and they've
ttdone a lousy job of it. Get rid of
ttthem fast, before you all get sick
ttand die. I may be an opportunist,
ttbut if these clowns did a better
ttjob, I'd be out of work. In the
ttlast seven deals I've been in,
ttthere were 2.3 million stockholders
ttthat actually made a pretax profit
ttof $12 billion. When I bought the
ttIxtlan Corporation it was in the
ttexact same position Teldar is
tttoday -- I turned three of its
ttcompanies private and I sold four
ttothers -- and each of these
ttcompanies, liberated from the
ttsuffering conglomerate has
ttprospered. I am not a destroyer of
ttcompanies, I am a liberator of them.
ttThe point is, ladies and gentlemen,
ttgreed is good. Greed works, greed
ttis right. Greed clarifies, cuts
ttthrough, and captures the essence
ttof the evolutionary spirit. Greed
ttin all its forms, greed for life,
ttmoney, love, knowledge, has marked
ttthe upward surge of mankind -- and
ttgreed, mark my words -- will save
ttnot only Teldar Paper but that
ttother malfunctioning corporation
ttcalled the USA...Thank you.

tMuch applause as he sits. Now a standing ovation; shouts of
tapproval. Cromwell knows he has lost the day, tries to
tcontinue the meeting by calling for "order".

tBud watches, impressed.

<b>tINTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE
</b>
tThe music is geared to speed, money, triumph and just plain
tmaterial fun.

<b>tINT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT
</b>
tIn its first stage, Darien supervising. It's expanse of
twhite walls devoid of mouldings, a blank plaster canvas. The
tcity views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of
tother cookie cutter condos. Several young artists are
tworking on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the
tliving room. They are colorfully dressed, listening to a
tTALKING HEADS tape while they work. A carpenter who looks
tlike a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old
tcolumns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the
tentrance to the living room while another fits a brass sink
tinto an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar.

<b>tINT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT
</b>
<b>tINTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE - SECOND STAGE
</b>
tLiving room furniture arrives. A fantail shrimp chaise from
tArt Furniture's "Sushi Collection" arrives, along with an
tenormous sofa encased in an ecru linen slipcover made
tdeliberately baggy and tied on with rows of self bows on
teach end, several faux Etruscan pots wired up as lamps, a
tpoured concrete coffee table that looks like it came from
tPompeii, and a hand-painted floor cloth instead of a rug for
tthe bleached floor with the stencilled border... Darien
tsitting in a fantastical adirondack chair made from gnarled
tbranches, amused by Bud's reactions to the furniture.

tTHIRD STAGE. The kitchen has the latest compact computer
tdishwasher and compact microwave, garbage compactor, and
tsinks with infrared controls... A brief food montage gives
tus a sense of the modernist approach to food and its
tpreparation:

t1) Darien hones the knives on the electric knife sharpener as

t2) Bud uses a stainless steel Cape Cod oyster opener to work
ton two dozen oysters...

t3) at the same time working on the automatic vinaigrette
tmixer, the phone ringing to the tune of Mozart's "Jupiter"...

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttt(picking it up)
ttYes...no...at 37 1/2. Convert the
ttbonds right...and check the price
ttin Tokyo at 8:00 LA time. Thanks...

t4) As he starts his pasta sauce flame an his O'Reilly fat-
tfree grill with a flexible neck fire starter...

t5) A freshly heated roll pops out of a hanging space-saving
ttoaster, as Darien works the electric pasta maker while
tmelting the frozen ice cream cartons in the microwave.

t6) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars
tfrom Verdi's "Rigoletto" as he works the piece de la
tresistance--the automatic sushi maker...

t7) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table.
tRed wine, pasta, sushi...it looks perfect, lit by
tcandlelight, the view of the city below.

<b>ttttDARIEN
</b>tt...isn't it perfect!

<b>ttttBUD
</b>tt...too perfect...let's not even eat.
ttLet's just watch it and think about
ttit.
ttt(pause)

<b>tFOURTH STAGE - INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY
</b>
tBud goes over a stack of bills with something approaching
tconcern as the gothic oak refectory table which seats 20 is
tcarried in, followed by a Jean Michel Basquiat featuring a
tskull on a rough board. Darien instructs the movers to place
tan important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered
tin buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for
t$20,000) at either end of the titanic sofa. No vestige is
tleft of the cookie cutter space we first saw. Walls have
tbeen removed, mouldings and architectural found objects
tadded, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been
tcreated from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil
tcrew. The point is, decorating can transform.

<b>tINT. CONDO - NIGHT
</b>
tThe look of the place is evocative of ancient times, yet
tsumptuous. Darien and Bud sink into the bales of down in the
tsofa and are dwarfed. She rests her head on a hand stencilled
tvelvet Venetian throw pillow, looking like a Pre-Raphaelite
tmadonna. A terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis
tgraces the coffee table. As the sun sets over the canyons of
thighrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe.
tThis apartment, perfect in its restrained taste with all the
t"correct" flowers and objects, has nothing to do with him.
tPerhaps he can understand the state-of-the-art kitchen, the
tcomputerized telephone, stereo and light system, but he
tneeds a set of instructions just to be able to switch on
tDavid Letterman.

tThis apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the
tincidental client who paid for it. Most importantly to her,
tit is ready to be photographed by House and Garden.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttt(dubiously looking at
ttta rough plaster wall
tttof fading fresco)
ttYou know, the elevator man couldn't
ttbelieve I paid $300,000 to have my
ttwalls looking like this, he's got
ttthem for free in Brooklyn.

<b>ttttDARIEN
</b>ttI'll bet he's got an opinion on the
ttstock market too. This apartment is
ttalready ahead of its time. I call
ttit the "demolished" look. They've
ttalready heard about it at House and
ttGarden and they're coming next week
ttto photograph it before it gets...
ttlived in. Is that alright? I'd love
ttto have it in my portfolio.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttSure... But your fee... considering
ttyou're way over budget, should be
ttnegotiable.

tAs he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops.

<b>ttttDARIEN
</b>ttLet's get things straight, Bud. I'm
ttnot going to take a cut. I worked
tthard and you can't decorate a room
ttin New York for less than $100,000.
ttCurtains alone...

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttI'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're
ttstill young, Darien. So what's
ttmoney anyway when everybody's
ttmaking it, it's all relative. After
ttall, this is not the house in
ttConnecticut, this is just a crash
ttpad good for a couple of
ttyears...before we slip our two
ttlovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie
ttinto the Lycee Francaise.

<b>ttttDARIEN
</b>ttYou got it all charted out don't
ttyou, like a stock projection.
<b>t 
</b><b>tttBUD
</b>ttThat's right -- one with high
ttyield, rich assets and no downside...

tAs the kiss grows, his hands move into her nether regions.
tShe looks at him, sober.

<b>ttttDARIEN
</b>ttDo you think you're ready?

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttIt's not me I'm worried about...You
ttknow Darien, the only reason we
tthaven't slept together is because
ttwe both know we will -- and not
ttknowing when was the only surprise

</b>ttIs this real? Is this really real?

<b>tEXT. BUD'S CONDO - TERRACE - NIGHT
</b>
tBud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet
toverlooking Central Park. The wind stirs his hair. The East
tand West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond
tnecklace of brilliant light.

tBud stares down at the world. He has it all now. The money.
tThe girl. The magic palace apartment. What more is there?
tSomething...because Bud suddenly throws a wrenching
tdislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he
tbrushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself.

tThere is no ready answer. As he finally turns and goes back

</b>ttt(getting the drift)
ttWhat does that mean?

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttt(playing out his ace)
ttThe three unions. It's 43% of
ttBluestar's operating budget, the
tthourly cost of a flight crew is
tt$850 an hour, that's the real

tBud, in high gear, all smiles, expensive Armani suit, opens
tthe door. His father stands before him, looking like a man
ton his way to the dentist.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttDad, well come on in. Everybody's
tthere. We couldn't start the show
ttwithout you.

tWide-eyed, Carl follows Bud through the foyer, taking in the
tfurnishings, paintings, antiques.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttt(under his breath)
ttWell I'll be a lousy Republican.

<b>ttttDARIEN
</b>ttt(overhears him)
ttI decorate for Democrats too, lots
ttof them.

tttand gives him a warm smile)
ttI'm Darien Taylor.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttt(sardonically)
ttI know. You're one of the art works
ttthat go with the apartment.
ttt(softens a little)
ttPretty creative. Doesn't look
ttanything like the place my son
ttbought a few months age.

<b>ttttDARIEN
</b>ttListen, I hope you'll come here
ttoften, and under less formal
ttcircumstances.

tHalfway won over Carl enters the living room where Darien
thas set up a table with miniature gourmet pizza, etc. The
tatmosphere is strained, the camps separated. Gekko stands by
tthe bar, conferring with his lawyer, Harold Salt. Darien
twalks over to the couch with drinks for the Ixtax Union
tReps: DUNCAN WILMORE, ALPA Leader, a rugged silver-haired
tuniformed pilot; TONI CARPENTER, AFA Rep, hard looking,
t40ish flight attendant.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttDad, you know Duncan Wilmore,
ttpilot's union, and Toni Carpenter,
ttflight attendants...

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttI met them before you were born.

tThey exchange nods.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttAnd I'd like to introduce you to Mr.
ttGekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttA pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.

tCarl stares at Gekko, sizing him up.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttI'd be proud to have a son like Bud.
ttHe's got a great future ahead of him.

tCarl looks to his fellow union representatives, then to Gekko.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttt(gesturing at Salt)
ttI thought this was an informal
ttmeeting. What's he doing here?

ttHarold, you don't mind strolling

ttOf course...

tSalt gathers his jacket to leave, as Gekko and Carl eye one
tanother, tentatively.

<b>ttttDARIEN
</b>tt...please help yourselves to some

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
tThe food is half consumed. Gekko addresses the union leaders.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttLook, I have no illusions about
ttwinning a popularity contest with
ttany of you. I was roasted the other
ttnight, and a friend of mine asked--
ttwhy are we honoring this man--have
ttwe run out of human beings?

tHis joke breaks the ice; they laugh, except for Carl.

<b>ttttGEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt's not always the most popular
ttguy who gets the job done. You got
ttlosses of 20 to 30 million dollars,
ttdividends cut to zero, you're
ttgetting squeezed to death by the
ttmajors. Present management may not
ttbe the worst scum of the earth, but
ttthey're the ones who've put you on
tta kamikaze course, and pretty soon
tteverybody's going to be scrambling
ttfor the parachutes. Only there
ttaren't enough to go around.
ttManagement has them. You don't. If
ttthey throw Bluestar into Chapter
tt11--which I think they will--then
ttthey can use bankruptcy laws to
ttbreak your unions and your
ttcontracts and throw you guys off
ttthe property.

tWe hear a loud crunching sound as Bud's father bites into a
troll, glaring at Gekko.

<b>ttttWILMORE
</b>ttt(pilot)
ttWith all due respect, Mr. Gekko,
ttwhat's to prevent you from doing
ttthe same thing?

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttCause I have a way around all this,
tta way we can all make money and
ttmake this airline profitable again.
ttWhat do you say we cut to the chase.
ttI'm asking for a modest twenty
ttpercent across-the-board wage cut.

tCarl drops his fork on the plate. Gekko goes on.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttAnd seven more hours a month.

tToni Carpenter and Duncan Wilmore exchange questionable looks.

<b>ttttCARPENTER
</b>ttWhat kind of time frame are we
tttalking about here?

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttGive me a year. If we're still
ttlosing money, the reductions stand.
ttIf however, we move into the black,
ttI return part of the givebacks,
ttsalaries go back to present levels,
ttand...
ttt(a beat)
ttwe institute an employee profit
ttsharing program with stock. You'll
ttown part of the airline.

tCarpenter and Wilmore react with surprise, it's obvious they
tweren't expecting the profit sharing part. Bud smiles at
tDarien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll
tbefore putting it back.

<b>ttttWILMORE
</b>ttAre you prepared to put that in
ttwriting?

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttI'll have a letter of agreement
ttdrawn up within two days.

<b>ttttCARPENTER
</b>ttWhat's your marketing strategy? How
ttdo you plan to return us to
ttprofitability?

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttWhy don't I give Bud an opportunity
ttto answer that.

tDarien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass.
<b>t 
</b><b>tttBUD
</b>ttThank you Mr. Gekko. First of all I
ttwant you to know my door will
ttalways be open to you cause I know
ttfrom my Dad it's you guys that keep
ttBluestar flying. One -- Modernize.
ttOur computer software is weak, we
ttupdate it, we squeeze every dollar
ttout of each seat and mile flown.
ttYou don't sell a seat to a guy for
tt$89 when he's willing to pay $389.
ttEffective inventory management
ttthrough computerization will
ttincrease our load factor by 5 to
tt20%, that translates to
ttapproximately 50 to 200 million
ttdollars in revenues; the point is,
ttwe can beat the majors at a price
ttwar. Two -- Advertising -- more,
ttmore, and aggressive, attack the
ttmajors. Three -- expand our hubs to
ttAtlanta, North Carolina and Dallas,

tThe men are visibly shaken by Bud's determination.

</b>ttt(restrained, hopeful)
ttIf you mean what you say, I think
ttwe're in the ball park. I'll take
ttit to my people.

<b>ttttCARPENTER
</b>ttt(approvingly)
ttYou've sketched some broad strokes.
ttI'd like to see the fine print. But
ttso far so good.

tGekko looks to Carl Fox who, putting down knife and fork,
tbreaks his silence.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttI guess if a man lives long enough,
tthe gets to see everything. And I
ttmean everything. What else do you
tthave in your bag of tricks, Mr. Gekko?

tBud tenses, looking at his father. Gekko ignores the
tinnuendo and replies softly.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttFrankly, Carl, I can't see giving
ttmuch more. If you have any
ttsuggestions I'll be glad to listen.

</b>ttThere came into Egypt a Pharoah who

ttI beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?

</b>ttt(smiling)
ttNo, it's a prophecy. The rich have
ttbeen doing it to the poor since the

ttthe Egyptians didn't have unions.
ttt(looking at Wilmore
tttand Carpenter)
ttI know what this guy is about--

ttand he don't take prisoners. He

</b>ttNow, wait a minute, Dad...

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttt(shrugs, keeping his composure)
ttSure. What's worth doing is worth
ttdoing for money. It's a bad bargain
ttwhere nobody gains. And if this
ttdeal goes through, we all gain.

tCarl throws down his napkin, rises from the chair, looks at
tthe others.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttt(looks at Bud)
tt'Course my son did work three
ttsummers as a baggage handler and
ttfreight loader. With those

tThere is frozen silence at the table.

tCarl turns and leaves. Bud glances at Gekko, reading his

ttCongratulations. You did a great

tWildman's broker takes the order with a curt "got it" and
tdashes out of the cubicle over to the Bluestar post where a
tchaotic crowd is gathered, traders frantically screaming to
tsell Bluestar shares. He looks at the Big Board--sees an XTR

tThe 35" television is on to:

<b>ttttNEWSCASTER
</b>ttThe big Wall Street story tonight
ttis the  roller coaster ride of
ttBluestar Airlines. Fueled by
tttakeover rumors, the stock soared
ttto an all-time high of 24 1/8. Then
ttwhen contradictory rumors later
ttsurfaced that the takeover was
ttunfounded, buyers went running for
ttcover, and the stock plummeted on
ttgigantic volume to as low as 16 1/2
ttbefore closing at 17.

tCamera discovers Gekko sitting, grimly watching the report.
tRudy seen riding his toy car in background.

ttt(a beat)
ttAccording to many sources, raider
ttSir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in
ttand bought a substantial block of
ttBluestar and is going to announce a
ttdeal tomorrow at 18 that includes
ttthe support of the unions.

tCamera now tracks in close on Gekko as he absorbs the
tunexpected blow. O.S. Rudy yelling and squealing. Gekko
tleans back, putting the pieces together, his eyes narrowing
tinto burning slits. He smashes the glass cocktail table with
ta massive paperweight as Kate hears it, shocked.

<b>tEXT. WALL STREET - MORNING
</b>
tPeople rushing to work. Bud crosses the street, his face
tburied in The Financial Times. Insert: "SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN

</b>
tSatisfied, Bud folds the paper and heads into his office
tbuilding.

tHe walks past Carolyn the receptionist who is strangely mute...

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttSmile, Carolyn, there's justice in
ttthe world...

<b>tINT. MAIN OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tHe passes the CHINESE STOCKLADY. She sees him and manages to
tlook away. Marvin exchanges a look with him but can't bring
thimself to talk. Bud wonders...the whole office seems
tsilent, the other BROKERS stealing glances.

t...as he passes Lou Mannheim with Charlie Cushing, who
tignores Bud...

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttHow's it going Mr. Mannheim? Got
ttout of Bluestar in time I hope?

tMannheim stops, winds up. Bud impatient but polite.

<b>ttttMANNHEIM
</b>ttt(with gruff affection)
ttBud I like you, just remember

</b>ttI think I understand what you mean

tBut not really. As, on this increasingly strange morning, he
tmoves on past Janet who wants to tell his something but he
tcuts her off.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttGet my father will you Janet?

<b>tINT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tAs Bud walks in, the camera glides to reveal the young SEC
tINVESTIGATOR, who has been tracking Buddy, going through his
tfiles. A SECOND MAN, PATTERSON, is standing behind the desk
tusing the phone as a bored-looking 3RD MAN and POLICEMAN
tstand off to the side with Hieronymus Lynch, who gives Bud a
twithering glance.

<b>ttttPATTERSON
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttHe just came in. I'll talk to you

tOn Bud--a struck-dumb look passing to resignation, as if for
ta long time now, he has been expecting this.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttI guess you're not here to open an

tLong shot. Activity is winding down, a few sunbathers
tcollecting their blankets. A solitary figure stands on a
thill silhouetted by the sunset. A second figure appears on a
tfootpath and starts climbing the hill towards the other man.

tGekko waits, expressionless... Bud approaches him. They
tstand facing each other.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttHello Bud.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttGordon.

<b>ttttGEKKO
</b>ttYou sandbagged me on Bluestar.

ttI guess you think you taught the

tBud looks away. Gekko's smile fades.

<b>ttttGEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>ttWell let me cue you in: the ice is
ttmelting under your feet sport...

tWithout warning, he grabs Buddy roughly by the lapels and
tlets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps
tacross his face.

<b>ttttGEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou think you could've gotten this
ttfar this fast with anybody else?
ttYou think you could be out there

ttyou'd be cold calling dentists and
ttwidows to buy twenty shares of some

ttI opened doors for you!...I showed

tGekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with
tthe blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.

</b>tt...the value of information! How

ttResources, Transuniversal, Fulham
ttOil. And this is how you pay back,

ttgave you your manhood. I gave you
tteverything.

tHe backhands Bud across the face. Bud lies on the ground,
tspent, as is Gordon breathing hard. Bud gets to his knees,
tblood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied. Passersby
tlook on, wondering.

tGekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse. He
thands Bud a handkerchief. Bud staunches the flow of blood
tfrom his nose.

<b>ttttGEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(softly, innocently)
ttYou could've been one of the great

tBud looks at Gordon, torn by mixed emotions: the bonds they
tshare and the betrayal wrought.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttt(shakes his head, thoughtfully)
ttI don't know. My Dad once told me,
tt"money is something you need in

ttguess I realized I'm just Bud Fox.
ttAnd as much as I wanted to be
ttGordon Gekko--I'll always be Bud Fox.

tHe looks at Gordon, as if wanting to say more, but doesn't.

tIn long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away.

tMORRISSEY and AGOSTINI, the two investigators, rip the tape
toff his chest, retrieving a small tape recorder. Morrissey
