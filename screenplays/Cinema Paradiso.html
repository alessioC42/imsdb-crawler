</b><b>t1  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tThe October sun slashes through the gray clouds, cuts across the
tshadow towards the sea, along the coast where the new suburbs of the
tcity of Giancaldo have been built up.
<b>t
</b>tBright light streams through the windows, glancing off the white
twalls in an almost blinding reflection. MARIA, a woman a little over
tsixty, is trying to find somebody on the phone.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>tt...Salvatore, that's right, 
ttSalvatore. Di Vita Salvatore
tt...But, miss, what do you mean you 
ttdon't know him?!...I...Yes...
ttt(She gives a nervous sigh. 
tttShe has dialed her way 
tttthrough endless numbers 
tttbut still hasn't managed 
tttto speak to Mr. Di
tttVita. She finally heaves a 
tttsigh of relief.)
tt...That's right, good for you! 
ttOh!...yes...And I'm his
ttmother. I'm calling from Sicily. Been 
tttrying all day...Ah, he's not 
ttthere...But would you be so kind as 
ttto give me...?...Yes...
ttt(She nods at another woman 
tttaround forty sitting 
tttnearby: it is LIA, her 
tttdaughter, who jots down 
tttthe numbers her 
tttmother dictates:)
tt...Six, five, six, two, two, oh, 
ttsix...Thanks ever so
ttmuch...Goodbye. Goodbye.
<b>t
</b>tShe hangs up, takes the number LIA has jotted down, determined to have still 
tanother try. LIA speaks to her as if she were a baby, to be more convincing.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLIA  
</b>ttLook, Ma...It's useless calling him. 
ttHe'll be terribly busy, God knows 
ttwhere he is. Besides he might not 
tteven remember. Do as I say, forget 
ttit...He hasn't been here for thirty 
ttyears. You know how he is. 
<b>t
</b>tMARIA pauses to think it over. The decision she has to make is important. Then, 
tstubbornly.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttHe'll remember! He'll remember! 
ttt(She puts on her glasses 
tttand starts dialing 
tttthe number.)
tt...I'm positive. I know him better 
ttthan you do. If he were to find 
ttout we hadn't told him, he'd be 
ttangry. I know. 
ttt(She takes off her 
tttglasses.)
tt...Hello? Good morning. Could I 
ttplease speak to Mr. Salvatore Di 
ttVita. I'm his mother...
<b>t
</b><b>t2  ROME. STREETS. EXT/INT. NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIt's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown.
tInside a high-powered car, a man  around fifty is driving. It is
tSALVATORE Dl VITA. Elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face
tcreased by deep wrinkles. His weary expression hides the determined,
tsell-assured manner of the successful self-made man. He must be a
theavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his
tcigarette.
<b>t
</b>tHe stops at a red light. He stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the
twindow, as a little Fiat Uno pulls up alongside. A rock tune plays full
tblast on the radio. SALVATORE turns instinctively to have a look at the
tman at the wheel  a BOY with a brush cut standing straight in the latest
tfashion. He studies the Boy's expression with almost exaggerated
tattention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly. The GIRL sitting beside him,
tlots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns SALVATORE'5 look,
tprovocatively. The BOY notices, turns to SALVATORE in a surly voice:
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBOY  
</b>ttHey! What the fuck you looking at!?
<b>t
</b>tGreen light. The Fiat Uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake.
<b>t
</b><b>t3  ROME. SALVATORE S APARTMENT. INT. NIGHT 
</b><b>t
</b>tThe apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished. There is no one waiting for 
tSALVATORE. Through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen 
tslumbering in the night. SALVATORE gets undressed on his way to the bedroom. He 
tmoves quietly, as if to make no noise. He doesn't even turn on the light, 
tfinishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window. 
tA rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCLARA  
</b>ttSalvatore...But what time is it? 
<b>t
</b>tShe turns on the bedside light. It is CLARA, a young woman around thirty. 
tSALVATORE climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a 
twhisper.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttIt's late, Clara. Sorry, but I wasn't 
ttable to let you know I wouldn't be 
ttcorning...
ttt(He fondles her, but he is 
ttttired, feels like 
tttsleeping.) 
ttGo to sleep now. Sleep.
<b>t
</b>tHe turns over on the other side. CLARA shuts her eyes, is about to drop off, 
tbut whispers.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCLARA  
</b>ttYour mother phoned. She took me for 
ttsomebody else...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttt(Surprised) 
ttAnd what'd you tell her?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCLARA  
</b>ttI played dumb, so as not to 
ttdisappoint her. We had a nice little 
tttalk. She says you never go see her, 
ttand when she wants to see you she has 
ttto come to Rome...Is it true?
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE doesn't answer. God only knows how often he's heard that question 
tbefore.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttShe phoned just to say that? 
<b>t
</b>tShe reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCLARA  
</b>ttShe said a certain Alfredo had died. 
ttAnd the funeral's taking place 
tttomorrow afternoon...
ttt(A strange look suddenly 
tttcomes into SALVATORE'S 
ttteyes. The idea of going to 
tttsleep has clearly left 
ttthim. It's a piece of news 
ttthe didn't expect. That's 
ttttaken him off-guard. CLARA 
tttwould like to carry on the 
tttconversation, but 
tttsleepiness makes 
tttit almost impossible. An 
tttshe can manage is one last 
tttquestion in a faint little 
tttvoice:)
ttWho is it? A relative of yours?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttNo. Sleep. Go to sleep.
<b>t
</b>tShe falls asleep in the dead silence of the night. SALVATORE is seized by a 
tsort of chill a deep, troubled feeling. He gazes through the window al the city, 
twith its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a 
theavy curtain of rain. But he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the 
tdark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless 
tmemories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he 
tthought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re-emerges, comes back to 
tlife, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle-aged features of 
this face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is 
tformed, an ancient, remote image...
<b>t
</b><b>t4  GIANCALDO. CHURCH AND SACRISTY. INT. MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tAn image from over forty years before. In the baroque church of
tGiancaldo. SALVATORE is nine years old. Dressed as an altar boy, he
tis kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands. The
tcongregation is also kneeling. The PRIEST is consecrating the Host.
tLittle SALVATORE has just got out of bed, is still half-asleep, yawns
tand doesn't notice that the PRIEST is standing there with the Host in
tthe air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPRIEST  
</b>ttPss! Pssst!
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the
twithering look of the PRIEST. He gets the message at once and
trings the bell. Now the PRIEST can carry on, lifts the chalice and
tthe bell is heard again.
<b>t
</b>ttttttCut to:
<b>t
</b>tThe service is over. The PRIEST is in the sacristy removing his
tvestments. And SALVATORE is also there, removing his altar-boy
ttunic.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPRIEST  
</b>ttBut how can I make you understand? 
ttWithout the bell I just can't go on! 
ttAlways half asleep, you are! What do 
ttyou do at night anyway? Eat instead 
ttof sleep?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttFather, at my house we don't even eat 
ttat noon. That's why I'm always 
ttsleepy. That's what the vet says.
<b>t
</b>tThe PRIEST has finished disrobing. He takes the bell
tSALVATORE was holding during the service and turns to leave.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPRIEST  
</b>ttAll right, Toto, get moving, I've got 
ttthings to do. Say hello to your 
ttmother.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttCan I...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPRIEST  
</b>ttt(Interrupting him) 
ttAnd don't ask if you can come...
ttBecause you can't!! Shoo, shoo, off 
ttwith you!!
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE gives a shrug and leaves. The PRIEST goes down a
tcorridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door
tleading to an outside courtyard. He cuts across it and disappears
tinto another door.
<b>t
</b><b>t5  CINEMA PARADISO AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. MORNING
</b><b>t
</b>tThe PRIEST enters a movie house. Not very big  200 seats on the main
tfloor and another seventy in the balcony. Along the walls, posters of
tfilms to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures. In one corner,
ta statue of the Virgin Mary with flowers. The CLEANING LADY has
tfinished work and is leaving. Up in the balcony, over the last row of
tseats, are the holes of the projection booth. The middle hole is
tcamouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the
tlens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth.
tthere are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be
tmade out, appearing and disappearing...It is ALFREDO, the
tprojectionist. He is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough
tpeasant face. He has finished loading the projector and is checking the
tcarbons in the arc lamp. Then he removes the glass from one of the
tholes and looks down into the theatre, at the PRIEST who waves his
thand.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPRIEST  
</b>ttOK, Alfredo, you can start!!
<b>t
</b>tHe sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre.
tUp in the booth, ALFREDO lights the arc lamp and sets the
tprojector going.
<b>t
</b>tDown in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth
tstreams the glowing ray aimed al the screen. String music, sweet
tand ominous, spreads through the theatre. On the screen appear
tthe credit titles of an American film of the 1940s. The PRIEST
tscrews up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on
tthe arm of his seat.
<b>t
</b>tAt the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves,
topens a crack and SALVATORE'S gaunt little face appears. He
thas managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a
tword, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen.
tThe credit titles have long come and gone. The story is at a
tturning-point. 
<b>t
</b>tUp above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion,
tALFREDO watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the
tPRIEST, who is now drumming the bell with his fingers. On the
tscreen, the male and female lead, two Hollywood stars, are in
tclose-up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic. SALVATORE,
tcarried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty
tof the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he
tis sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen. 
<b>t
</b>tThe love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love-struck 
tcouple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. Instinctively, the PRIEST 
traises the bell into the air, as in some age-old ceremony, and gives it a loud 
tring...
<b>t
</b>tUp in the booth ALFREDO hears the bell; it's the signal he's been
twaiting for. He takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that
tpurpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that
tspecific scene as it winds on to the reel. The projection
tcontinues...
<b>t
</b>t...And also the kiss of the two actors. The PRIEST'S nervous look lingers on 
tthose black-and-white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last 
tdeclaration of love before separating. SALVATORE is wide-eyed, he's probably 
tnever seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the 
tattraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. The screen is now filled with 
tthe figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, 
tvoluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. SALVATORE stares in open-mouthed 
twonder. The PRIEST, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth. 
tFrom the sound of the bell to another sound...
<b>t
</b><b>t6  GIANCALDO. MAIN SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b>tThe tolling of the bell-tower rings out over the 
tsquare. It is noon. The vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people. A 
tnoisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water. 
tPeddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries. People come and go in front of the 
ttown hall. The working men's club is deserted. The entrance of the Cinema 
tParadiso is shut. Hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been 
tseen on screen. Up above, the windows of the projection booth are open. The hum 
tof the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of 'THE END'. 
tThen dead silence. The showing is over.
<b>t
</b><b>t7. CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tDespite the speed, numerous white streaks spin around on the reel,
tcreated by the slips of paper ALFREDO has inserted into the loops. He
tis rewinding the film by hand on the film-winder. When he's not
ttalking, ALFREDO usually sings to himself. SALVATORE stands beside
thim, taking in everything he does with those quick, thieving eyes of his
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttt(Harshly, shouting) 
ttYou must not come here! How many 
tttimes do I have to tell you?
ttt(And he slows down the 
tttreels with his hand. The 
tttslips of paper
tttare about to arrive. 
tttHere's the first.)
ttIf the film catches fire, runt that 
ttyou are, you'd go up in a
ttburst of flame...whoosh! And turn 
ttinto a piece of...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttt(Overlapping him)
tt...and turn into a piece of 
ttcharcoal!!
<b>t
</b>tHe's used to his terrorisms, pays no more attention. Not even his
tgrim look scares him. Anyway, ALFREDO catches the joke, starts to give him a 
tslap, but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttt(Angrily) 
ttChrist, that's a sassy little tongue 
ttyou've got! Watch out, or someday 
ttI'll snip it off. 
<b>t
</b>tAnd he snips a piece of film, pastes the ends together and goes on turning the 
thandle. SALVATORE picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look. He sees 
ta series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttCan I have it? 
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO snatches it out of his hand, furiously, at the end of his string. He 
tshouts.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttNo!!! Are you deaf or something? I've 
ttgot to put this back in when we wind 
ttup the film again! You're a real pain 
ttin the neck! 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE reaches into a basket full of strips of film. He takes out a handful: 
tall kisses that have been cut.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttThen why didn't you put these back 
ttwhen you wound up the films again? 
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO is caught out. He stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck 
tin and cuts the scene:
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>tt'Cause sometimes you can't find the 
ttright place any more and so...well, 
ttactually...they stay here. 
ttt(Finding an excuse) 
ttBesides, there are more kisses than 
ttyou can count.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttt(Excited) 
ttSo I can have these? 
ttt(ALFREDO explodes, flies 
tttoff the handle. He grabs 
tttSALVATORE by the shoulders 
tttand shakes him.)
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttLook, Toto! Before I kick your ass 
ttall the way to China and back, let's 
ttmake a deal. These strips here are 
ttyours, I give them to you. However! 
ttOne  you're not to stick your nose in 
tthere any more. Two  I'll keep them 
ttfor you, because you can't take them 
tthome for God forbid and save our 
ttsouls, if they catch fire, all hell 
ttwill break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now 
ttscram! 
<b>t
</b>tHe takes him and turns him towards the stairs. For him the matter is closed. He 
treturns to the film-winder. SALVATORE sneaks back and while ALFREDO's attention 
tis elsewhere, snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter, 
tstuffs them into his pocket and...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttWhat sort of deal is this? The strips 
ttare mine! So why can't I come see 
ttthem? 
<b>t
</b>tAnd he stares at ALFREDO with a sly, saucy look. ALFREDO clutches his hand, 
tdarts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass. He 
tshrieks:
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttGet out!! And don't show your face 
tthere again! 
<b>t
</b>tAnd before the kick reaches its destination, SALVATORE has already dashed off 
tdown the spiral staircase.
<b>t
</b><b>t8  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING
</b><b>t
</b>tThat was not the first theft of film strips. SALVATORE's hand reaches
tinto a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film. He takes out a
tfew frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp. Gazes at the
tfigures that remind him of the films seen at Cinema Paradiso, and in a
twhisper mangles fragments of dialogue, the shooting of guns, the
tmusical climaxes...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttBang! Bang! Bang! Shoot first, think 
ttlater! This is no job for weaklings! 
ttTreacherous dog!
<b>t
</b>tThe house has no lights, is gloomy and cold. SALVATORE's
tmother, MARIA, is leaning on the table in front of him. She is
tyoung, around thirty, and her pretty face is haggard, marred by
tall the sacrifices. She is sewing some clothes, is a seamstress. LIA,
this four-year-old sister, is sleeping on a cot in one corner. The
tkerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on
tthe wall, figures of prairies, gunslingers, thugs. SALVATORE's
tvoice changes, turns even tougher.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE
</b>ttHey there, you lousy bastard, take 
ttyour hands off that gold, You black-
tthearted pig, stay away from me, or 
ttI'll smash your face in! 
tt'Ntantatah!!!...
ttt(In the heap of movie 
tttframes there are also 
tttseveral photographs. 
tttSALVATORE picks them up. 
tttFamily keepsakes. A man in 
tttan army uniform. Then the 
tttsame man with a girl 
tttbeside him whose smiling 
tttface can be recognized as 
tttMARIA. SALVATORE takes a 
tttcloser look at the man's 
tttface, then whispers to his 
tttmother:)
ttMa, if the war's over, how come 
ttDaddy's never come back?
<b>t
</b>tMARIA looks up at him with a sweet smile.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttHe'll be back, he'll be back...
ttYou'll see. One of these
ttdays...
<b>t
</b>tBut there is not much conviction written on her face. She looks
tback down at her sewing. SALVATORE goes on looking at the
tphotos.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttI don't remember him any morex97Ma, 
ttwhere's Russia?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttIt takes years to get there. And 
ttyears to come back...Now go to bed, 
ttToto, it's late.
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE puts the photos back into the box and tucks the box
tunder LIA's cot near the charcoal burner.
<b>t
</b><b>t9  GRADE SCHOOL. COURTYARD. EXT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tA noisy crowd of little children in black smocks, white collars and blue
tbows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm
ttrees. The boys head for one door, the girls towards the opposite one.
tThe Janitors line them up two by two, ready to enter. Here and there,
tparents and relatives accompany the younger ones. Beneath one of the
tpalms, SALVATORE pulls off the altar-boy tunic, stuffs it into the
tkhaki-colored cardboard schoolbag, takes out the smock and puts it
ton, as one of his schoolmates passes by. It is MASINO, and he's crying
tdesperately because he doesn't want to go to school. His FATHER drags
thim along, yelling:
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMASINO'S FATHER
</b>ttYou can fool your mother but not me! 
ttGet yourself a damn diploma and 
ttbecome a policeman. You good-for-
ttnothing!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMASINO  
</b>ttI don't want to go to school'
ttt(The sound of the bell. 
tttThe black lines move up 
tttthe steps towards the 
tttschool.)
<b>t
</b><b>t1O  FOURTH GRADE. INT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b>tSALVATORE is sitting at the front-row desk next to PEPPINO, 
ta little freckle-faced boy. His attention, like that of the whole class, is 
tconcentrated on what is taking place at the blackboard. The TEACHER is standing 
tthere, watching a plump little boy, shy and not quite all there, do a two-figure 
tmultiplication  it is NICOLA SCORSONE, known as 'COLA'. He is red in the face, 
thas one purple ear and one white one. He stares in terror at that '255 x 15' 
twritten on the blackboard. The TEACHER yells, waving a birch rod in her hand. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttTEACHER  
</b>ttWell then?! Five times five 
ttequals...? 
<b>t
</b>tCOLA stops to think a moment, then... 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCOLA  
</b>ttThirty!
<b>t
</b>tThe TEACHER grabs him by the purple ear and bashes his head against the numbers 
ton the blackboard. A large thud echoes through the room, followed by a roar of 
tlaughter. The TEACHER slams her rod on the desk.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttTEACHER  
</b>ttSilence!! 
ttt(Then to COLA) 
ttThe five times table. Dunce! One 
tttimes five, five!!
ttt(The class repeats with 
tttthe TEACHER, in a sing-
tttsong chorus:)
<b>t
</b>ttttTEACHER and CLASS  
ttTwo times five, ten! Three times 
ttfive, fifteen! Four times five, 
tttwenty!
ttt(With a wave of the rod, 
tttthe TEACHER silences the 
tttclass, and finishes the 
tttsing-song with the fateful 
tttquestion.)
<b>t
</b><b>ttttTEACHER  
</b>ttFive times five?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCOLA  
</b>ttt(Timidly) 
ttForty...?
<b>t
</b>tAnother blow of the head on the blackboard. Hubbub.
tSlapping of the rod on the desk. SALVATORE secretly shows
tCOLA the picture of a Christmas tree on one page of the book,
tand mouths the word 'twenty-five'. COLA smiles, he has finally
tcaught on.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttTEACHER  
</b>ttI'm asking you for the last time, 
ttblockhead! Five times five equals...?
ttt(COLA turns to her with 
tttsmiling eyes and answers 
tttblissfully:)
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCOLA  
</b>ttChristmas!!
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE clutches his head in anger, watches the TEACHER
tflogging COLA on the back with the rod. COLA screams at every
tblow, and at every blow the laughter in the class grows louder.
tSALVATORE stares at the rod moving up and down rhythmically. But he is not 
tthinking of the pain his schoolmate is feeling, but is drawn, rather, by that 
tstrange regular beat, finds it similar to another regular beat, that of...
<b>t
</b><b>t11  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND MAIN FLOOR. INT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>t...the rolling pin ALFREDO uses to flatten out a reel of film that has just 
tbeen unloaded. SALVATORE carefully watches ALFREDO 5 every move. He is not in 
tthe projection booth, but up in the balcony, standing on top of the last row of 
tseats. He peers through the hole next to the lion's head. His bright little eyes 
tfix in his mind the things ALFREDO does, as he loads the film into the 
tprojector, shuts the fireproof housings, turns on the amplifier, checks the 
tcarbons in the arc lamp, then lowers his head to have a look into the theatre 
tand finds himself face to face with SALVATORE.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttt(Sternly) 
ttWhat are you doing here? 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttI bought a ticket. I've come to see 
ttthe film.
ttt(Meanwhile the USHER comes 
tttup behind him and grabs 
ttthim by the collar, and he 
tttalmost jumps out of his 
tttskin. ALFREDO laughs.)
<b>t
</b><b>ttttUSHER  
</b>ttt(Yelling) 
ttGo sit downstairs! You good-for-
ttnothing sponger! ! 
ttt(To the audience) 
ttWorse than rabbits they are!
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE has run downstairs. The main floor is more
tcrowded than the balcony, like every Sunday, and there is a greatdin. The BOY 
tselling ice-cream, soda pop and candy shouts and
truns around like a chicken with its head off. Now the lights dim,
tthe hubbub dies down and the performance starts. Before the film
tthere is a preview for Stagecoach. The screen fills with images ofJohn Wayne, 
tthe pursuit of the stagecoach by hostile Indians
tetc...
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE is sitting in the front rows, right under the screen,
tnext to BOCCIA, COLA, MASINO, PEPPINO and OTHER KIDS, all with their noses in 
tthe air. BOCCIA, the biggest show off of the group, is smoking a cigarette. An 
tOLD MAN appears through the entrance curtain, takes a couple of steps and 
tshouts:)
<b>t
</b><b>ttttFIRST OLD MAN  
</b>ttHello, everybody!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttAUDIENCE  
</b>ttt(At once) 
ttSsssssh!!! Ssssssh! Silence!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttFIRST OLD MAN  
</b>ttCan't I say hello?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttUSHER  
</b>ttIt's a double-feature today.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttFIRST OLD MAN  
</b>ttI couldn't care less. I come here to 
ttsleep.
<b>t
</b>tAll at once, a chorus of shouts and whistles fills the theatre. Up
ton the screen, a globe of the world appears, spinning among the
tstars, the logo announcing the newsreel.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttAUDIENCE  
</b>ttt(Hooting and whistling) 
ttFor Christ's sake! Cut it, 
ttAlfredoooo!
<b>t
</b>tThe CHILDREN in the front rows also yell, but SALVATORE goes
ton being alert. He turns and looks up at the holes of the projection
tbooth, as if it were an impregnable fortress. He watches the crazy
tdancing of light in the glowing stream that opens towards him in a
tcone. And besides, that lion's head, mysterious, almost gruesome,
temphasizes the enigmatic secret of the movies. In his dreamy eyes,
tthat lifeless lion seems to wake up with a ferocious roar.
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE has a frightened look...Another lion roaring. But up on the screen. 
tThe MGM lion. The throng of children imitate the famous growl all together, 
tshaking their heads in unison.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCHILDREN  
</b>ttGrrrr! Grrrrr! 
<b>t
</b>tThe film starts: it is Visconti's La terra trema. SALVATORE is in bliss. His 
twide eyes looking up at the magic square of light. The title music. Another OLD 
tMAN enters at the back of the theatre, but before sitting down, says hello in a 
tloud voice.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSECOND OLD MAN  
</b>ttGreetings to one and all!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttAUDIENCE  
</b>ttSSSSSH' Drop dead! Silence! Hey, 
ttkids, we're here to see the film! 
<b>t
</b>tNow there is an important sequence. The audience is silent. Concentrated on the 
tscreen. BOCCIA passes the lighted cigarette to SALVATORE. He takes a puff and 
thands it on to the others without ever taking his eyes off the screen. The 
tbeautiful star of the film appears on screen. A different kind of attention 
ttakes hold of the excited audience. SALVATORE and the others stare at her with 
topen mouths...She leans towards the leading man, a languid expression, their 
tprofiles touch. But all at once, just at the best part, there is a sudden jolt. 
<b>t
</b>tThe kiss isn't seen.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttAUDIENCE  
</b>ttt(Disappointed) 
ttAhhh! What a shame! I've been going 
ttto the movies for twenty years and I 
ttnever saw a kiss! 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE is the only one to laugh to himself. He knows what has happened.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttAUDIENCE  
</b>ttAnd when will we see one? 
<b>t
</b>tUp in the balcony, the audience is more sedate. The tickets cost more and the 
tpeople are richer, more refined. Among them, a MAN with a moustache, the look of 
ta public notary, is sitting right in front of the railing. Seriously, without 
tbatting an eye, he spits down below with contempt. Right on the dot, a voice is 
theard, followed by a chorus of protests.
<b>t
</b>ttttVOICE and AUDIENCE  
ttBugger!!! Ssssh!!! Silence!!
<b>t
</b><b>t12  SQUARE AND ENTRANCE OF CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tThe bell-tower rings midnight. The square is nearly deserted. Except
tfor a landowner near the refreshment stand, with a moustache and a
that, DON VINCENZO by name, who is picking out from a group of
tlabourers the men he'll be needing in the country at dawn. He chooses,
tpoints his finger, calls...
<b>t
</b>tPeople come out of the movie house after the last showing.
tThe USHER locks the front door as ALFREDO climbs down from the
tprojection booth. Among the crowd there is only one kid, SALVATORE.
tTired, half-asleep. He's seen all the showings. He starts to walk away
twhen he catches sight of his mother standing on the opposite corner,
twrapped in an old coat. She's waiting for him, in a temper.
tSALVATORE drops his eyes to the ground, mortified. He knows what's
tcoming. He goes over to her timidly, uncertain, gives her a questioning
tlook.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttI've been looking for you all day. 
ttDid you buy the milk?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttNo...
<b>t

</b>ttThen where's the money?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttSomebody stole it.
<b>t
</b>tMARIA gives him a slap. SALVATORE holds back the sobs, but
this eyes brim with tears. ALFREDO and the USHER are nearby,
thave heard everything.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttWhat'd you do with the money? Go to 
ttthe movies?
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE nods his head and the sobs increase. MARIA, in
tdespair, flies off the handle, slaps him again, but looks as if she
tdoesn't really want to, as if deep down she forgives her son's
tescapade. ALFREDO catches on, speaks up on behalf of
<b>tSALVATORE.
</b><b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttSignora Maria, don't do that. He's 
ttjust a kid. 
ttt(To SALVATORE) 
ttAnd why are you telling fibs? 
ttt(To MARIA) 
ttWe let him in free. He must have lost 
ttthe money inside the movie

tttin amazement, goes on

<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttThanks, Uncle Alfredo. Thanks. Good-
ttnight.
<b>t
</b>tShe walks away, dragging SALVATORE by the hand. ALFREDO
tgives him a wink. SALVATORE smiles and winks back, but he's
tnot very good at it; he can't manage to shut only one eye.
tEverybody leaves and the square empties, as the VILLAGE IDIOT
tcomes up to the group of labourers, beside DON VINCENZO,
tmotioning them all to get moving.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttIDIOT  
</b>ttIt's midnight. I've got to shut down 
ttthe square! Go away.
ttThe square's mine! The square's

<b>t
</b><b>t13  CEMETERY ROAD AND VILLAGE ROAD. EXT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tSALVATORE, dressed as an altar boy, walks alongside the PRIEST
twho is wearing the ceremonial vestments. They are tired, have walked
ta long way. Behind them a donkey pulls a wagon containing a little
twhite coffin and a bunch of flowers. Behind that a little procession  the
tparents and relatives of the dead child. The road is very wide, covered
twith white earth. The spring sun is dazzling. The funeral procession
tkicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy, like a
tdream, rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea. The
tprocession now turns into the large gate of the cemetery. ALFREDO,
tworking in the fields, takes his hat off and watches the coffin as it passes by.
<b>t
</b>ttttttCut to:
<b>t
</b>tThe funeral is over. The PRIEST and SALVATORE are walking back
tto the village. ALFREDO appears out of the countryside on e bicycle
twith a hoe and other farm tools in the basket. He comes pedaling up
tbeside them.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttGood morning, father. It's hard on 
ttthe feet, huh?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttPRIEST  
</b>ttt(Breathless) 
ttYeah!...Getting there's downhill and 
ttall the saints help you. But coming 
ttback! The saints stand there watching 
ttyou, that's all! God's will be done.
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE is about to open his mouth, wants to say something
tto ALFREDO, but he doesn't have time. ALFREDO pedals harder
tand rides off.
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE is crestfallen. He looks et the PRIEST, then at the bicycle riding 
taway. His eyes light up  an idea! He suddenly yells:
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttOuch! Ouch! My foot! I can't walk!
<b>t
</b>tHe limps. Throws himself to the ground as if a snake had bitten him. The PRIEST 
tleans over in alarm. Up ahead in the distance, ALFREDO turns around to look.
<b>t
</b>ttttttCut to:
<b>t
</b>tThere is a smile on SALVATORE'S face. He is riding on the crossbar of ALFREDO's 
tbicycle. On their way back lo the village.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttAlfredo, did you know my father?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttOf course I knew your father. He was 
tttall, thin, pleasant, and had a 
ttmoustache like mine. Always smiling. 
ttHe looked like Clark Gable. 
<b>t
</b>tThere's something SALVATORE wants to talk about, but he doesn't know how to 
tstart. He has a try with an innocent stratagem.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttAlfredo, now that I'm older, I'm not 
ttsaying I can start coming to the 
ttprojection booth, to the movie 
tthouse...But...maybe, why don't we 
ttbecome friends? 
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO knows exactly what the little rascal is up to, and answers in a 
tstrange, theatrical tone, as if he were repeating something he knows by heart, a 
tremark taken from some old film.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttt'I choose my friends for their 
ttlooks, and my enemies for their 
ttbrains...' 
ttt(Laughs) 
ttYou're too smart to be my friend. 
ttBesides, as I always tell my kids, be

<b>t

ttBut you don't have any kids!!!
<b>t

</b>ttt(Spluttering) 
ttAll right, all right! When I've got

tttinto sight.)
<b>t
</b><b>t14  SALVATORE S HOUSE. EXT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tLIA, SALVATORE'S kid sister, is crying outside the front door, terror
tstricken. Her face is smeared with smoke and her little dress half
tscorched and soaking wet. MARIA is distraught, damp with sweat, and
ttries to console her, hugging her in her arms.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttStop crying...The fire is out...I'm 
tthere...That'll do, that'll do...
ttt(ALFREDO and SALVATORE 
tttcome up behind them. 
tttSALVATORE has barely leapt 
tttoff the bicycle when his 
tttmother sails into him like 
ttta fury, shrieking:)
ttMiserable boy! You're the ruin of me! 
ttYour sister would have been burnt 
ttalive if I hadn't been there! And all 
ttyour fault!
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE darts off, chased by his mother, swift as a deer.
tALFREDO doesn't understand what has happened, leans over
tLIA, who goes on bawling her eyes out, and sees on the ground, in
tthe middle of the water, a flowery box all charred and still
tsmoking, and all around scraps of film reduced to ashes and
tseveral singed photographs, the photos of SALVATORE s father.
tALFREDO gets the message now, looks up at MARIA, who has
tcaught SALVATORE and is dragging him home, hitting and
tslapping him all the way. SALVATORE covers his head with his
thands to stave off the blows. MARIA turns to ALFREDO, in a
tstern, indignant voice.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA
</b>ttBut aren't you ashamed of yourself, 
ttUncle Alfredo, playing with a little 
ttboy at your age?!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttt(Cowed) 
ttBut...what's it got to do with

<b>t

</b>ttAnd who gave him all those films? 
ttPromise you won't give him any more 
ttof this trash! Don't let him set foot 
ttany more in the movie house. The 
ttboy's crazy! Crazy! All he talks 
ttabout is movies and Alfredo' Alfredo 
ttand movies!! 
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO is crestfallen, didn't think that SALVATORE'S craziness, his morbid 
tpassion for movies, could go this far.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttI give you my word, Donna Maria. 
ttt(MARIA now turns one last 
ttttime to her son.)
<b>t

</b>ttGod's got to grant me one wish! Send 
ttyour father back home! And he'll see 
ttyou get what's coming to you! 
ttt(SALVATORE lowers his

tttwith the dreadful 
tttsincerity of children:)
<b>t

</b>ttDaddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
ttt(An icy flash runs through 
tttMARIA'S eyes.)
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttIt's not true! No! It's not true!!! 
ttI'll show you he's coming back!
<b>t
</b>tAnd she beats him desperately, as if to enforce her stubborn hope, slap after 
tslap. This time ALFREDO doesn't step in, lets MARIA give vent 
tto her rage and fury, but SALVATORE'S cries make him feel guilty.

</b><b>t15:SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b>tAnother Sunday. A crowd of men has gathered in the square around the cafxe9 where 
tthere is a loudspeaker. They are listening to the running commentary of the 
tsoccer games. They check their Sisal pools coupons. NICOLO CAROSIO'S VOICE

tpeers out of the window of the projection booth. CAROSIO'S voice drowns out the 
tsoundtrack of the film being shown. ALFREDO is bored. He goes over to the 
tprojector, looks through the hole...It's the last sequence of the film. The 
tmusic swells to a climax as 'THE END' appears on the screen. Swift as ever, 
tALFREDO turns on the lights in the theatre' stops the projector. Looks back 
tthrough the hole, to see...)
<b>t
</b><b>t16:CINEMA PARADISO. INT/EXT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>t...the house packed to the rafters. Voices and laughter of the children. Smoke, 
tice-cream, soft drinks. The USHER has opened the emergency exits to let in air. 
tHe fights off the gate-crashers who are trying to get in free. The sound of the 
tsports commentary fills the theatre. The village BLACKSMITH is sleeping in his 
tseat, his head thrown back and his mouth wide open. The KIDS blow up the empty 
tice-cream sacks and pop them next to his ears. Bang! The BLACKSMITH wakes up 
twith a start, in a sea of laughter. He yells:  
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBLACKSMITH  
</b>ttAh! I'll wring all your necks!! Or my 
ttgood name means nothing! !! Lousy 
ttbrats! 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE doesn't laugh. He is sad. He turns and looks up at the projection 
tbooth. He sees ALFREDO through the lion's mouth. ALFREDO also catches sight of 
thim. SALVATORE gives him a timid wave of the hand, as if asking if he can come 
tup a moment. The look on ALFREDO'S face is unmistakable, irrevocable: N0! 
tSALVATORE'S not surprised; after what happened it won't be easy to win him over. 
tYet there must be some way. But what is it? As usual, SALVATORE is smart as the 
tdevil when he's out to get something. Through the emergency exit he sees a woman 
tpass by with a packet in her hand. It is ALFREDO's WIFE, and the packet is his 
tsupper. SALVATORE leaps to his feet and runs out to her.

tALFREDO'S reaction, but pricks up his courage and shows him the
tpacket. ALFREDO sees him, is about to pounce on him...

</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttt(On the defensive) 
ttYour wife told me to bring you this.

</b>ttt(Sternly) 
ttGive it to me!...
<b>t
</b>tHe takes the packet, unwraps it and lifts the lid, shuts it again and puts the 
tcontainer inside the lamp of the projector to keep it warm. SALVATORE hasn't 
tmissed a single gesture, but speaks with his eyes 
tto the poor.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttI told my mother you weren't the one

</b>ttToto, come here. 
<b>t
</b>tAll things considered, there is something in that little boy, maybe his 
tfeverish passion, that strikes him. He'll talk to him seriously, without 
tresorting to terrorism, try to convince him. He lowers the volume of the 
tmonitor, sits down on the stool. SALVATORE raises his eyes from the floor and 
tlooks at him at last...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttNow listen to what I've got to say. I

</b><b>t20  GRADE SCHOOL DINING HALL. INT. MORNING 
</b><b>t
</b>tThe fifth-grade exams. In the vast dining hall all the children are seated, one 
tfor each desk, under the watchful eyes of the teachers. SALVATORE, BOCCIA, 
tPEPPINO, MASINO and COLA have taken places here and there, as nervous as 
teverybody else. The EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER is dictating the text of the 
tarithmetic problem. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttEXAMINING BOARD MEMBER  
</b>ttA merchant owns two stores. In the 
ttfirst he sells fruit and vegetables. 
ttIn the second he sells nails and

</b>ttExcuse me, professor. Here are the 
ttmen taking the exam for the 
ttelementary school certificate. 
ttt(Turning to the door) 
ttCome in, please...
ttt(All the children turn to 
tttlook. A MAN around thirty 
tttenters, ill at ease. The 
tttchildren recognize him and 
tttlaugh mischievously. The 
tttsecond is the BLACKSMITH, 
tttthe one who falls asleep 
tttat the movies. The third 
tttis a twenty-year-old-boy, 
tttANGELO. The fourth is 
tttALFREDO, embarrassed and 
tttred in the face. SALVATORE 
tttis speechless. Gives a 
tttslightly ironic laugh. 
tttThere is a look of revenge 
tttin his shrewd little 
ttteyes.)
<b>t
</b>ttttttCut to:
<b>t
</b>tThe assignment is now being carried out. There is dead silence in the 
thall. 
<b>t
</b>tTEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL moue about, checking to be sure there are no notes 
tbeing handed around or other forms of 'collaboration'. The four outsiders are 
thaving a hard time. It can be seen on their faces. ALFREDO is also in trouble, 
tdoesn't know how to solve the problem, the calculations are too diff cult. He 
tlooks at the desk next to him, where SALVATORE is sitting. SALVATORE is about to 
tlook up at him, but ALFREDO immediately looks away, too proud to let himself be 
tseen. 
<b>t
</b>tThe exchange of glances continues, grotesque, almost comical. SALVATORE 
tmeanwhile writes down numbers and operations quite quickly. ALFREDO can't stand 
tit any longer, is nervous, beaded with sweat. He's sorry he ever showed up. 
tSALVATORE laughs up his sleeve, now he has the upper hand. ALFREDO tries 
tsneaking a look at his exercise book in order to copy something. But SALVATORE 
tturns his back, hiding it from sight. ALFREDO tries sneaking a look at somebody 
telse's exercise book, but the damn kid also covers it. It looks like a 
tconspiracy against him. ALFREDO has no way out. He has to accept the idea of 
teating humble pie. He looks at SALVATORE, motions him with his eyes in a 
tconversation of glances. He asks for help, but SALVATORE stands firm, 
timplacable. 
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO tries to put it into words in a low voice.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO 
</b>ttYOU jerk. Tell me how to solve this 
ttfucking problem! 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttTEACHER  
</b>ttSsssh! Silence back there!! 
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO insists with his eyes. SALVATORE makes him understand with gestures 
tthat he could help him maybe, but...on one condition. He imitates the gesture 
tof winding the crank of the projector. ALFREDO gets the message. It's pure 
tblackmail. He rubs his hand over his sweating face, raises his eyes to the 
tceiling as if he were swearing. Then he surrenders, accepts the condition. 
tSALVATORE is serious, does not flaunt his victory, but you can tell he is happy. 
tHe takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared, with the solution to the 
tproblem, rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the TEACHER passes by, 
ttakes aim and flicks it to him. ALFREDO'S hand catches the precious and dearly 
tbought message in mid-air. Their quarrel is over.
<b>t
</b><b>t2I  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT. DAY/EVENING
</b><b>t
</b>tA bright, lilting tune marks the rhythm of the quick, blurred images, as
tin a dance, the images of ALFREDO teaching SALVATORE all the
tsecrets of the projectionist trade.
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO slips the reel on to the projector, unrolls the trailer and hands
tit to SALVATORE. SALVATORE mounts the film on the sprockets.
tNow SALVATORE sets the projector into motion, opens the shutter and
tstands on tip-toe to see the screen from the hole...
<b>t
</b>tA shot from In nome della legge. The main-floor audience applauds a
tline spoken by Massimo Gironi. And from the balcony, the same little
tMAN with the face of a public notary spits below.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAIN FLOOR VOICE  
</b>ttBastard!! Pencil-pusher!!
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO shows SALVATORE the running of the film. He points
tto a place on the projector.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttPay attention. This is where it can 
tteasily catch fire. If it
tthappens, the first thing you've got 
ttto do is break it off, here
ttand here, so the whole reel doesn't 
ttgo up in fames.
<b>t
</b>tOn the screen, a shot from Riso amaro. A kiss. Unrelenting, the PRIEST rings his 
tbell. SALVATORE licks the film on one side, then on the other. He laughs.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO 
</b>ttYou understand which side the 
ttgelatin's on?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttIt tastes wonderful!
<b>t
</b>tA shot of Amedeo Nazzari in La figlia del capitano. A jump,

ttYou see?

</b>ttOK, Alfredo.
<b>t
</b>tDown on the main floor, a scene from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
tEveryone screams and hides their faces when Hyde looks at the
tcamera.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttAUDIENCE  
</b>ttHoly Mother! What a face! So ugly!
<b>t
</b>tOne young man, ANGELO, doesn't hide his face. He looks up at
ta young woman, ROSA, in the balcony, who turns and smiles at
thim.
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO gives SALVATORE a wooden stool. He's had it made especially for him, so 
the can be high enough to reach the reels of the projector and the arc lamp. 
tSALVATORE climbs up on it. He laughs, all excited. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttNow you can run it by yourself. 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE gives another smile. He is posing in a photographer's studio . He is 
tall dressed up for first communion, holding a white lily. The flash goes off 
tlike lightning during a storm. Now SALVATORE is posing next to his mother and 
tlittle sister. They smile without hugging. Another flash of light. Click!
<b>t
</b><b>t22  FIFTH GRADE. INT. DAY

</b>tAnother click. The transparency of Rita Hayworth in her black gown
tfrom Gilda. MASINO is pasting it inside a minute pair of plastic field

</b><b>ttttMASINO  
</b>ttt(In a whisper) 
ttChrist, what a piece of ass!!!
<b>t
</b>tBut there is not a cheerful atmosphere in the class - on the
tcontrary, a strange silence. The pupils are all standing around the
tteacher's desk, having received their end-of-the-year report cards.
tPEPPINO, who shared SALVATORE s desk, is saying goodbye to
this schoolmates. BOCCIA, COLA, the others. They have serious,
tsad expressions. He and SALVATORE kiss like grown-ups. The
tTEACHER is standing among them. One of the schoolmates does
tnot respond lo PEPPINO's goodbye gesture. He takes a few steps
tback, serious, scared, his eyes lowered.

</b>tAnother farewell scene in the square. PEPPINO to his grandparents. His father 
tand mother are also there, saying goodbye to the old folks. There are tears. The 
tcardboard suitcases tied with string are loaded on to the luggage rack of the 
tblack car. The scene is watched by SALVATORE and ALFREDO, up in the window of 
tthe projection booth. They look like old friends. On the sound monitor, the 
tstrains of some American musical comedy tune. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttWill they really find work in 
ttGermany? 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO

</b><b>t
</b>tThe lion's head with the beam of light, seen from the balcony.
tSALVATORE'S face appears in the hole beside it, as he peers down at the
timages of the Settimana Incom newsreel.
tThe audience is distracted. The snoring of a man sleeping can be heard.
tA pair of urchins pick up a cockroach with their hands, tip-toe down the
taisle. The sleeping man is the same old BLACKSMITH, with his head
tthrown back. A little hand drops the cockroach into the gaping mouth.
tThe URCHINS take to their heels. The BLACKSMITH squirms, wake up
twith a start. Spits, while everybody laughs. The newsreel is now about
tmissing soldiers in Russia.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCOMMENTATOR  
</b>ttThe Defense Minister has announced a 
ttnew listof names of Italian soldiers, 
ttso far considered missing and now
ttconfirmed as dead. Families concerned 
ttwill be notified directly by military 
ttauthorities.
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE pays careful attention, sees the black-and-white
tshots of the last war. The Russian campaign. The troops in the
tsnow. Now in detail a heap of personal objects found on the
tcorpses. Documents, clothing, glasses, photographs. One quick
tdetail catches SALVATORE's eye  among those photographs, for one
tinstant he sees one he thinks he recognizes. He quickly sticks a slip of paper 
tinto the take-up reel, as when marking the kisses to be cut.
<b>t
</b><b>t25  PREFECTURE. CITY. INT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tThe hands of an OFFICIAL tear off several forms and give them to
tMARIA who is sitting in front of the desk. She is dressed in black.
tSALVATORE stands beside her, holding her hand. They have black
tbands on their arms. An empty stare in their eyes.
tMARIA is pale, a cold look in her sunken eyes. Her heart is bursting in
ther breast. And a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking. She
tlooks at her husband's belongings, identifies them  a gold chain, an ID
tcard and the photograph, the one SALVATORE saw in the newsreel.
tMARIA strokes it with her fingers. SALVATORE comes up and looks, as
tthe OFFICIAL concludes:
<b>t
</b><b>ttttOFFICIAL 
</b>tt...Unfortunately we don't know what 
ttwar cemetery he's buried in...This 
ttis the form for the pension. If you'd 
ttlike to sign it...
<b>t
</b><b>t26  PREFECTURE AND CITY STREET. EXT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b>tMARIA walks through the city. She holds SALVATORE by the hand. SALVATORE looks 
tup, trying to catch her eye. He sees her crying, in silence. The heartbroken 
ttears of someone who has lost the one last hope, but held back, so as not to be 
tseen by the child. SALVATORE presses close and puts his arm around her waist. 
tThey turn the corner, and walk off in the noisy city, disfigured by the ruins of 
twar. A poster for Gone with the Wind catches SALVATORE's eye. He smiles.
<b>t
</b><b>t27  CINEMA PARADISO. BOX OFFICE. PROJECTION BOOTH. SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
</b><b>t
</b>tWinter has returned. On the screen, a sequence from I pompieri di Viggiu. The 
ttheatre is jam full. The sea of heads sways and shakes at the irresistible jokes 
tof Toto. 
<b>t
</b>tSome people have climbed up on the window-sills. The aisles are crammed, an the 
tway down to the screen, where grown-ups and children sit on the floor, their 
tnoses in the air. Some people munch crusts of bread they've brought along from 
thome. Almost everybody is smoking. A woman laughs, holding the baby she is 
tnursing. In one corner, at the end of one of the aisles jammed with people 
tstanding, a girl laughs, but every now and then her expression reveals a look of 
tdeep pleasure. 
<b>t
</b>tHer body moves slightly. Clinging to her from the rear is a man bathed in sweat. 
<b>t
</b>tThey are making love standing there among the crowd, which notices nothing and 
tgoes on laughing.
<b>t
</b>tIn the balcony ANGELO is holding hands with ROSA.
tThe curtain over the entrance is open. People are also standing there,
tseeing what they can from the distance, even a corner of the screen
tthrough the forest of heads. But the line continues on outside...All the
tway to the entrance of the movie house, out in the square. There are
tcrowds of people, shivering from the cold, who protest, shove, risk
tprovoking incidents. The PRIEST, Father Adelfio, is exhausted, tries to
tcalm them down.
<b>t

tthe poster of the film a ' LAST DAY' sticker. The PRIEST, the
tTICKET-SELLER, the USHER and TWO CARABINIERES push the crowd back, close the 
tfront door. The protest grows louder. Fists pound the door.

</b>tTrying not to put his hand in front of the lens, ALFREDO removes the
tframe with the glass that protects the projection. He wheels it around
tand motions SALVATORE to look...On the wall behind the projector:
tthe film picture appears gradually, reflected by the glass, moves as the
tglass moves all the way over to the window looking out over the square.
tThere it disappears. SALVATORE can barely believe his eyes, as if it
twere a piece of magic. He takes a quick look through the hole to see if
tthe film is still showing on the screen. It is.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttt(Mysteriously) 
ttGo to the window, boy, and have a 
ttlook...
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE goes over to the window. Looks out. The reflected
tbeam of light ends up on the white row of houses facing the
tsquare. It's like another screen. Except the images are
tbackwards, like when you look in a mirror. And here and there
tare the windows of the houses...For SALVATORE, it's a
twonderful spectacle, like a dream, ravishing.

<b>t

</b>ttGood for you, Alfredo! 
<b>t
</b>tA close-up of Toto projected on the houses, and one of the windows opens. A MAN

tHe sees all those people looking at him and laughing together.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCROWD  
</b>ttShut the window!! Shut the window! Go

</b>tSALVATORE runs on. ALFREDO looks wistfully towards the huge image in the 
tsquare. Down in the square SALVATORE heads for the crowd, his eyes trained on 
tthe house-front screen. Behind him, the door of the movie house opens. The 
tPRIEST, Father Adelfio, sees the film being projected on the house front, 
tthe people standing or sitting on the ground, laughing. His eyes nearly pop out 
tof his head. Then he motions over the TICKET-SELLER, whispers something into his 
tear. The TICKET-SELLER strides over to the shivering spectators, pulls the pad 
tof tickets out of his pocket.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttTICKET-SELLER  
</b>ttLadies and gentlemen! You have to buy

ttOtherwise...
<b>t
</b>tThe crowd roars with laughter. SALVATORE laughs too, as if carried away by it 
tall. And over the general merriment looms the shadow of ALFREDO, standing in the 
twindow of the projection booth. All at once, on the house-front screen, the 
timage of Toto slows down for an instant, a white blister appears and spreads 
tuntil it fills the whole screen. The crowd gives a start of bewilderment and 
tfear. SALVATORE jerks his head around to look at the booth.
<b>t
</b><b>t29  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b>tThe film bursts violently into flame among the gears and sprockets of the 
tprojector. ALFREDO is taken off-guard. He breaks the film running into the take-
tup reel, but is unable to do it for the delivery reel. He grabs the film which 
tis catching fire and pulls it out quickly, tries to stop the flames from 
treaching the reel in the f reproof housing. A desperate race against the speed 
tof the fire. The flames on the floor burn his legs. ALFREDO gives a jump, slows 
tdown the movement of his hands for an instant and inevitably the flames run 
tahead, reach the upper housing. It's like an explosion. The flames leap out, 
tstriking him full in the face. ALFREDO doesn't have time to scream, struggles 
tdesperately and falls to the floor. Meanwhile the flames envelop everything.

<b>t
</b>tIn the general panic, SALVATORE tries in vain to get inside, elbows his way 
ttowards the street with the stairs leading to the projection booth. The audience 
tclashes against him, knocks him to the ground, almost trampling him underfoot. 
tHe is suddenly seized by a superhuman force; gets up, claws his way desperately 
tahead, with people falling on top of him and to the floor. He finally succeeds, 
tstarts up the stairs...

tALFREDO's body on the floor, burning. SALVATORE moves quickly, throws a blanket 
tover his shoulders, drags him by the feet over to the stairs, as boxes and other 
tobjects fall on him. Using the same blanket, he stamps out the flames that have 
tseared ALFREDO'S clothes. With the force of desperation, he drags him further 
tdown the stairs which have been reached by the smoke but not by the flames. 
tALFREDO doesn't move, his face is burnt. SALVATORE looks at him and only now is 
tpanic-stricken, lets out a terrified shriek, like a wounded colt.

tthe new projectionist: SALVATORE. He is very nervous, but serious, self-
tpossessed. His worried-looking mother is also there for the occasion. The PRIEST 
tturns to SPACCAFICO.

tinauguration film. Among the spectators, SALVATORE'S mother, MARIA, and his kid 
tsister, El A. Up on the screen, a man and a woman kiss. The first time a kiss 
thas been seen at the Cinema Paradiso. The audience murmurs, surprised and 
texcited.

</b>ttOoooooh! They're kissing!! Look at

<b>t
</b>tAn OLD LADY sitting next to the MAYOR, crosses herself, flabbergasted. CICCIO 
tSPACCAFICO chuckles. Rubs his hands: these are going to be golden times for him. 
tFATHER ADELFIO gets up and stalks out of the theatre, indignant; he'll
tnever set foot in the place again. The love theme gets louder and
tlouder...
<b>t
</b><b>t40  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING
</b><b>t
</b>tThe same music spreads through the booth from the monitor. SALVATORE is by 
thimself. He is watching the film through the hole but strangely enough, the 
tstory doesn't absorb him. ALFREDO'S absence makes him nervous, he gazes at the 
tstool he used to sit on. Il has been repainted. A voice from the rear of the 
tcabin:
<b>t
</b><b>ttttANNA'S VOICE  
</b>ttToto?...
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE turns and at the top of the stairs sees SIGNORA
tANNA and behind her, ALFREDO, her husband. He is wearing a
tpair of dark glasses and walks with the kelp of a cane. He has
tlost his sight, but not his spirit. He smiles:
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttAny room for me in this Cinema

ttt(SALVATORE runs over and 
tttembraces him.)
<b>t

</b>ttt(to SALVATORE) 
ttToto, will you bring him home when

</b>ttYes. Signora Anna. 
ttt(To ALFREDO) 
ttI'm glad you came.
<b>t
</b>ttttttCut to:
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO is now sitting there immobile. He listens to the soundtrack of the film. 
tSALVATORE studies the way he stares into empty space, and the idea of darkness 
tfrightens him. There is something new in ALFREDO'S manner, as if having grazed 
tdeath and the loss of his sight had endowed him with a deeper knowledge of men 
tand life.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttHow's school?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE

</b>ttWhy? What do you mean?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttToto, this isn't for you. For the

ttyou, and you need the Cinema

ttt(He reaches out and 
ttttouches SALVATORE'S face 
tttto 'feel' his expression.)
ttThat's right, more important. I know 
ttit. Now that I've lost my sight I see 
ttmore. 
ttI see everything I didn't see 
ttbefore...
ttt(As ALFREDO moves his hand 
tttfrom SALVATORE's face, we 
tttsee that he is now a young 
tttman, and that ALFREDO is 
tttolder, grayer.) 
ttAnd it's all thanks to you, who saved 
ttmy life. And I'll never forget it...
ttt(SALVATORE doesn't 
tttunderstand his strange 
tttwords. ALFREDO can 'feel' 
ttthe is troubled.)
ttAnd don't put on that look. I haven't 
ttgone off my head yet. You want proof?
<b>t
</b>tAnd he gives a joking smile. SALVATORE is curious, expects one of his fiendish 
ttricks.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttt(Smiling) 
ttYes. I want proof.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttFor example, at this moment the 
ttfilm's out of focus. Go see. 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE stands up in disbelief. He looks through the hole, and indeed the film 
tis out of focus. He puts it back into focus, flabbergasted.

twhispers ahead of time all the lines of Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson, knows them by 
theart. Among the crowd in the balcony there is ALFREDO and his wife, the MAYOR, 
tDON VINCENZO the landowner, the schoolteachers. Now the music is loud, heart-
trending. 'THE END' appears on screen. The lights go on. And there is a great 
tdin and uproar as one audience leaves and another arrives. The race for empty 
tseats. Quarrels. The CARABINIERES help the USHER maintain order and persuade the

tclaps his hands over his ears. Alternating with the machine-gunfire on screen, a 
treal pistol shoots the back of one of the spectators, the landowner DON

tfalls like a dead weight to the ground...SALVATORE photographs the animal in 
tthe throes of death with his 8mm movie camera. As well as the faces of the MEN 
twho now bleed and skin it quickly. In the vast slaughter-house, the voices of 
tthe men and animals mingle together.
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE'S eye is quick to catch the most unexpected expressions of ordinary 
tpeople. His movie camera is always ready, like a hunter's rifle. Now he is 
tshooting...
<b>t
</b>tA meeting in the square: the passionate reactions of the peasants listening to a 
tspeaker who flails his arms around.
<b>t

tdreams, her eyes staring off into empty space, as a tear runs down her pale, 
tunhappy face, and the unknowing STUDENTS carry out their assignments.
<b>t
</b>tAt the railroad station: the nervous excitement of the people waiting on the 
tplatforms. SALVATORE pans his camera on to TWO MEN fighting. But an arriving 
ttrain comes in between. Salvatore follows the train, pans along the cars. The 
ttrain stops. 
<b>t
</b>t-A door opens and the passengers climb out. Several TRADERS, a CARABINTERE, a 
tgroup of commuting STUDENTS, the TICKET-COLLECTOR, a distinguished looking 
tCOUPLE and lastly, a GIRL who stops in the middle of the viewfinder. SALVATORE 
tis immediately attracted by her face. He goes on shooting without leaving it a 
tmoment. He follows her through the lens. She is very beautiful, must be around 
tsixteen, a simple, sweet face, blue eyes. She is certainly the daughter of the 
tdistinguished looking COUPLE who got off just before she did. The little family 
tmoves off down the platform. Salvatore follows the girl's movements, as if 
thypnotized. Now she passes by him, turns towards him for one moment, as if 
ttrying to figure out where he is aiming that funny-looking gadget. SALVATORE 
tsmiles at her, entranced.

tgesture. A flash come into his eyes, the same flash he had as a little
tboy when he finds the right way to hit home. He picks up his step,
ttrips BOCCIA and brings him to the ground. He pounces on him
tand lets go with his fist. He starts running again. Picks the
tbundle off the ground. Catches up with the GIRL from the
tstation, nervous and inexperienced, but polite.

</b><b>t
</b>tSALVATORE has a black eye, swollen shut. He is setting up a little 8mm projector 
ton a stool. ALFREDO is sitting in one corner. He has come to keep him company. 
tHe listens to the sound-track of the movie being shown. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO
</b>ttChaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto? 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttThat's right, Modern Times. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttI've shown it so many times I know it 
ttby heart. The first time I showed 
ttit, in 1940, was the Sunday my first 
ttwife died. They kept it hidden from 
ttme all day so they wouldn't have to 
ttclose down the movie house. I only 
ttfound out that night, after the last 
ttshow. Those are things you never 
ttforget...
ttt(Changing his tone.) 
ttSo, Toto, how are these home movies 
ttgoing? 
ttt(SALVATORE has switched on 
tttthe little projector and a 
tttsquare of light appears on 
tttthe wall beside ALFREDO, 
tttwith the scenes shot in 
ttttown.) 
<b>t

</b>ttYes.

</b>ttt(Whispering) 
ttWhat is it, what is it? What's the 
ttpicture? 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttIt's people in the slaughter-house 
ttkilling a calf. There's blood all 
ttover the floor, like a lake. And 
ttthrough this lake another calf passes 
ttby on its way to die. 
<b>t
</b>tALFREDO is concentrated, as if SALVATORE'S description transmitted the 
treal image to him, the colours, the forms. The railway station has appeared on 
tthe wall, and the sequence of ELENA. SALVATORE does not move, does not say a 
tword, as he gazes at those blue eyes looking into the camera. ALFREDO senses 
tsomething funny in the boy's s11ence.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttNow what can you see?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttNothing, there's nothing. It's all

</b>ttt(Smiling) 
ttIs there a woman?...Tell me the 
tttruth...
ttt(SALVATORE is shamed, 
tttuncertain, doesn't know 
tttwhet to say. A tender look 
tttfilters through ALFREDO's 
tttdark glasses. He has 
tttobviously caught on and 
tttwhispers:) 
ttThere is a woman.

</b>tSALVATORE is forced to admit it, with a sigh.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttYes, it's a girl I saw at the 
ttstation.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttWhat's she like? What's she like?...
<b>t
</b>tAnd as other shots of ELENA appear on the screen, SALVATORE describes her. As 
tonly somebody in love could.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttShe's nice. My age...Slender, with 
ttlong hair, brunette. She had big blue 
tteyes, a simple expression and a 
ttlittle beauty mark on her lip, but 
ttreally tiny. You can only see it 
ttclose-up. And when she smiles...She 
ttmakes you feel...
<b>t
</b>tHe stops. Only now does he realize that he has let himself be carried away by 
tpassion, by the desire to talk about her. ALFREDO smiles, spellbound...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttEh! Love...what a mystery!
ttt(SALVATORE turns off the 
tttprojector and heaves a 
tttdeep sigh, almost of 
tttliberation. ALFREDO'S 
tttsympathy does him a lot of 
tttgood. It's nice to be 
tttunderstood. He moves over 
tttcloser to him. ALFREDO 
tttruns his hand through his 
ttthair, whispers:)
ttI understand you, Toto...The ones 
ttwith blue eyes are the
ttmost beautiful. Whatever you do, you 
ttcan't make friends with
ttthem.
ttt(SALVATORE is comforted by 
tttthe way he talks. He 
tttdidn't think it
tttwas possible to put into 
tttwords the things he has 
tttfelt since meeting
tttELENA. He nods his head. 
tttALFREDO sighs.)
ttEh, there's nothing to be done about 
ttit! The heavier a man is,
ttthe deeper his footprints. And if 
tthe's in love, he suffers,
ttbecause he knows he's up a one-way 
ttstreet. Because love is a
ttmeaningless thing when a man gets it 
ttinto his head to do what
tthe wants...
ttt(SALVATORE is touched by 
ttthis sensitivity, by his 
tttintense, passionate, sweet 
tttway of speaking.)
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttWhat you say is wonderful! But sad...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttt(Smiling) 
ttThey're not my words. John Wayne said 
ttit in Shepherd of the Hills.
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE suddenly changes expression, as if discovering he was being made fun 
tof.

tSALVATORE doesn't stop to think twice, dashes off, runs through streets
tfull of dust, another square, turns the corner, but has lost sight of her.

ttOnce upon a time a king gave a feast 
ttand there were all the most beautiful 
ttprincesses of the realm. Basta, one 
ttof the guards, saw the king's 
ttdaughter: she was the loveliest of 
ttall! And he immediately fell in love 
ttwith her. But what could a poor 
ttsoldier do compared with a king's 
ttdaughter?!...One day he managed 
ttto meet her and told her he couldn't 
ttlive without her. The princess was so 
ttstruck by the depth of his feeling 
ttthat she said to the soldier  'If you 
ttwill wait a hundred days and a 
tthundred nights beneath my balcony, 
ttthen in the end I'll be yours.' 
ttChrist, the soldier ran off there and 
ttwaited! One day, two days, 
ttten, twenty...Every night she looked 
ttout of her window, but he never 
ttbudged. Come rain, wind, snow, never 
ttbudged! The birds shat on him and the 
ttbees ate him alive! After ninety 
ttnights he was gaunt and pale and 
tttears streamed from his eyes but he 
ttcouldn't hold them back. He didn't 
tteven have the strength to sleep any 
ttmore. The princess kept watch...And 
tton the ninety-ninth night, the 
ttsoldier got up, picked up his chair 
ttand left!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttNo! You mean right at the end? 
ttt(SALVATORE is amazed, 
tttdumbfounded; that ending 
ttthas made a deep

tttstart walking again.)
<b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttThat's right, Toto, right at the end? 
ttAnd don't ask me what it means. If

</b><b>t6I:CHURCH.INT.EVENING
</b><b>t
</b>tBefore the high altar, the Virgin Mary in tears clutches three spikes inher 
thand. And beside her is another statue  Christ descended from the
tcross. MEN and WOMEN stand in line to kiss Christ's wounds. Many people are 
tsitting between the pews. SALVATORE helps ALFREDO take a seat, and at that 
tmoment catches sight at the far end of ELENA on her way to the confessional. 
<b>t
</b>tShe kneels down on one side, just as FATHER ADELFIO comes out of the middle 
tbooth and goes to the altar to say something to the sacristan. SALVATORE'S eyes 
tlight up. He has had a brainstorm. 
<b>t
</b>tHe leans over and whispers something into ALFREDO's ear. ALFREDO nods his head. 
tSALVATORE is so happy that he gives him a pat on the cheek, like a caress. Then 
the hurries over to the PRIEST. Says something in a low voice, gesticulates with 
tsome agitation, points to the pew where ALFREDO is sitting. The PRIEST tries to 
tsay he can't now, but SALVATORE insists, and wins. The PRIEST goes over to 
tALFREDO, leans over. 
<b>t

</b>ttWhat is it, Alfredo? Right now, of

<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE watches from a distance. He sees the PRIEST put on an alarmed 
texpression and then sit down beside ALFREDO. Everything's ready. He creeps over 
tto the confessional. ELENA is there, kneeling down waiting for the PRIEST to 
tarrive. In an instant, without anyone noticing, SALVATORE pops inside the 
tconfessional. He shuts the little door below and draws the purple curtain. On 
tthe other side of grille, only a few inches away, those eyes that keep him awake 
tall night. 
<b>t

</b>ttFather, I have sinned...

<b>t

</b>ttBut Alfredo, what you're saying is

</b>ttI know. But take the-miracle of the

<b>t
</b>tIn the confessional, the whispered conversation between SALVATORE and ELENA 
tcontinues.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttELENA  
</b>ttt(Annoyed) 
ttThere was a terrible rumpus at home. 
ttMy mother told my father. And how

<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE is mortified, on tenterhooks, keeps an eye on ALFREDO and the PRIEST 
tthrough a crack in the curtain.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttForgive me, Elena. It was stupid of 
ttme. But I had to talk to you. 
<b>t
</b>tShe looks up at him and her eyes are even more beautiful in the candlelight. 
tThis time SALVATORE finds the courage to speak to her calmly, with 
tdetermination. That grille probably helps him, allows him to see without being 
tseen.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttYou're so beautiful, Elena...That's 
ttwhat I wanted to tell you. When I 
ttmeet you, I can't put two words

ttBut I think I'm in love with you. 
<b>t
</b>tELENA gazes through the grille at the two shining specks of his eyes. She is 
tbewildered by that flood of passion. At that moment, an OLD WOMAN kneels down on 
tthe other side of the confessional and her face appears behind the grille.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttOLD WOMAN  
</b>ttFather, I have sinned...
ttt(SALVATORE turns lo her, 
tttinstinctively.)

tttshut in her face. ELENA is 
tttbarely able to control her 
tttlaughter.) 
ttWhen you laugh, you're even more 
ttbeautiful. 
<b>t
</b>tShe pulls herself together again and puts on a serious, but tender look.

</b><b>ttttELENA  
</b>ttSalvatore, it's awfully sweet of you. 
ttAnd even though I don't know you, I 
ttlike you. But...I'm not in love with 
ttyou. 
<b>t
</b>tFor SALVATORE, it's as if a knife had plunged straight into his heart. He sits 
tthere gazing into her eyes, at the beauty mark on her lip, without moving. Then 
tthrough the crack sees ALFREDO and the PRIEST conversing nervously, God knows 
twhat they're saying. And he turns back to her.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttI don't care. I'll wait.
<b>t

</b>ttFor what?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttFor you to fall in love with me too.

theard coming from the houses. Old discarded objects hail down from balconies. 
tFirecrackers explode here and there. SALVATORE is there in the same old place,

treaches its climax. Two hands come out. SALVATORE shuts his eyes for a moment,

</b>tAt his house, glasses are about to be raised. There is a strange, tense 
tmerriment. MARIA is unable to conceal her concern, her presentiment. She glances 
tat the door, hoping to see SALVATORE appear.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttt(To Maria) 
ttThere's nothing to worry about. He's 
ttprobably with his friends. 
ttt(To all) 
ttLet's toast!

</b><b>ttttEVERYBODY  
</b>ttt(Toasting) 
ttHere's to you! Here's to you! Happy 
ttNew Year!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttFor Toto too, here's to you!! Happy 
ttNew Year! !
<b>t
</b>tEverybody echoes MARIA'S toast...
<b>t
</b><b>t66  ELENA S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT 
</b><b>t
</b>tBut SALVATORE is not happy in these first few minutes of the New Year. He feels 
thurt, humiliated, rejected. He walks off amidst the old discarded objects flying 
tdown from the terraces. That was his last night. He's not showing up beneath 
tthat balcony any more.
<b>t
</b><b>t67  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON 
</b><b>t
</b>tOutside there is a violent thunderstorm. The pounding of the rain and the 
trumbling of the thunder drown out the sound-track of the film being shown. Two 
tbuckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof. SALVATORE 
tis alone. For the first time he feels he hates the profession he's got into. He 
tis tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for 
tELENA. He tears it into a thousand pieces, as if trying to wipe out the traces 
tof his grief. He is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't notice that 
tsomeone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room. And 
tnow stands there watching him in silence. The thunder is deafening. That someone 
tis ELENA. She comes up behind him, realizes he is thinking 
tabout her. Whispers. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttELENA  
</b>ttSalvatore...
<b>t
</b>tLoud passionate music is heard on the monitor. SALVATORE turns and sees her as 
tif in a dream. It is a sudden blow to the heart. The look on her face is 
twonderfully sweet, the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and 
twho now realizes at last that she is in love too. For SALVATORE it is an 
toverwhelming, almost unbearable moment...A long passionate embrace that is 
tnever-ending. They are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other 
tagain. 
<b>t
</b>tThey spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the 
tfirst-part endings and the trailers. Another intense look, their eyes 
tlocked...And it is their first kiss. A kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost 
tclumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant. Amidst the film strips dangling 
taround and touching their young faces. Meanwhile the film has finished, the 
tprojector turns uselessly...Down below the screen is blank, the audience 
twhistles...But SALVATORE hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless 
twhirring of the reels in the projector. All he hears is her breathing, an he 
tfeels is the warmth of her 
tskin.
<b>t
</b><b>t68  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tThe happiest, most vivid moments SALVATORE and ELENA spend
ttogether:
<b>t
</b>tA country outing. They eat a lavish salad using the flat branches of the
tprickly pear for plates.
<b>t
</b>tA chase through an endless field of wheat.
tIn the projection booth. A cake with seventeen lighted candles.
tSALVATORE and ELENA blow them out together. And then a kiss.
<b>t
</b><b>t69  ROAD AT THE EDGE OF TOWN.EXT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tSALVATORE is driving an old beaten-up Balilla he bought from a
tcar-wrecker. ELENA sits beside him, having the time of her life. They
troar with laughter. The car jolts, moves by fits and starts, jarred by the
tholes in the road, and besides SALVATORE is not such a hot driver. She
tfondles him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttELENA  
</b>ttt(Ironically) 
ttYou have a great future as a driver. 
ttIf they don't arrest you first!!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttThat's nothing to do with it, it's 
ttthe car that's still being run in...
<b>t
</b>tHe has barely finished the last sentence when the car gives a
tsudden violent shudder. A sharp report. A cloud of white smoke issues from the 
tmotor. And the Balilla stops dead in its tracks. ELENA and SALVATORE cannot 
tsmother their wild laughter. They embrace. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttELENA  
</b>ttSO now how do we get home? 
<b>t
</b>ttttttCut to:  
<b>t
</b>tThe two of them are standing beside the empty road, looking bored, as they have 
talready been waiting a long time for someone to go by, a car, a wagon. When all 
tat once a car comes around the bend, heading for town. SALVATORE and ELENA flag 
tit down. 
<b>t
</b>tThe DRIVER slows down. The back door opens, a MAN gets out. An alarmed and 
tstartled look comes over ELENA's face  that man is her FATHER. She sees him 
tstride over in a rage. 
<b>t
</b>tHe has almost reached SALVATORE, who tries lo be polite, to make the best of the 
tsituation. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttHello, Dr Mendola...Hem...
<b>t
</b>tELENA buries her face in her hands, so as not to see...
<b>t
</b><b>t70  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
</b><b>t
</b>tSALVATORE has a bruise on his cheek and two Band-aids on his face.
tHe got himself a good thrashing, and then some. The house is jammed,
tas on the great occasions. Curiosity is written all over the faces of the
taudience. But what they're seeing is not a film, but an instalment of
tDouble or Nothing. SALVATORE is standing by a teleprojector which
thas been set up in the central aisle of the balcony. It is a machine that
tmakes it possible to project television show on the screen. ALFREDO is
tsitting beside him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttt(In a low voice) 
ttToto, are you pulling my leg or 
ttsomething? How is it possible to see 
ttthis television without film?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttJust so, Alfredo. There isn't any. 
ttAnd if you buy a television set, you 
ttcan watch it at home, without any 
ttfuss...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttt(Sceptically) 
ttCould be...But I don't like this
ttbusiness. It smells fishy to me.
<b>t
</b>tELENA is sitting in one corner of the balcony with her parents. Sitting beside 
ther FATHER is the owner of the movie house, SPACCAFICO, who thanks him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSPACCAFICO  
</b>ttt(In a low voice) 
ttYou see what a bright idea, Dr 
ttMendola? But without the bank loan 
tthow could I have bought the machine? 
ttIf we don't get organized around 
tthere, in this day and age, we'll meet 
ttthe same end as the Punch and Judy 
ttshows! 
<b>t
</b>tELENA is not very interested in the TV show. She sneaks a look at SALVATORE. 
tFrom the looks on their faces, it is clear that things are not going very well. 
tHe gives her a nod, as if to say he wants to speak to her and that she should 
tfigure out some way! ELENA leans over to her MOTHER, whispers something into her 
tear.
<b>t
</b><b>t7I  CINEMA PARADISO. TOILET. INT. EVENING
</b><b>t
</b>tELENA's MOTHER stands waiting in front of the women's toilet,
tgazing at Mike Bongiorno emceeing the TV show in the distance.
<b>t
</b>tInside the toilet, ELENA is standing on the toilet seat whispering to
tSALVATORE, who is standing on the 20ilet seat of the men's toilet.
<b>t
</b>tTheir eyes are barely able to peek over the flush tank which they have
tuncovered. ELENA is worried.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttCould it be your father doesn't like 
ttthe work I do...That my family's too 
ttpoor...Is that it? 
<b>t
</b>tShe gives a nod of the head, but only faintly, so as no2 to wound his

ttt(To Salvatore, in a

<b>t
</b><b>ttttELENA'S MOTHER  
</b>ttt(Off-screen) 
ttElena! 
<b>t
</b>tELENA climbs down, pulls the chain and walks off, leaving SALVATORE standing 
tthere on the toilet seat.
<b>t
</b>tSummer has come. A bevy of barefoot children chase after the carts carrying the 
tcarters' families to the beach to go swimming. SALVATORE, helped by the USHER, 
thas finished loading the disassembled projector on to a wagon in order to carry 
tit to the outdoor movie house. The USHER has hung a sign on the Cinema Paradiso 
tto the effect that 'Showings to continue at the Imperia Arena', and now climbs 
tinto the wagon. 
<b>t
</b>tThe horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds 
tSALVATORE that the summer is going to be long this year, longer than ever. And 
the leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the 
twheels. A cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the 
twagon. There are the MEN from the slaughter-house. They recognize SALVATORE. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSLAUGHTER-HOUSE MAN 
</b>ttWell, look who's here!! Cecil B. De 
ttMille! Hey, Toto!! When are you 
ttcoming to shoot another film?!? 
<b>t
</b>tAnd they laugh, with their gaping toothless mouths. SALVATORE doesn't feel like 
tjoking, not even like answering. He looks away, so as not to see their leers. He 
twants to be by himself. 
<b>t
</b><b>t73  BEACH AND IMPERIA ARENA. EXT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b>tThe beach is almost deserted, dotted here and there with groups of bathers. The 
tcarts and horses are scattered in the sand, near the Imperia Arena, where some 
tWORKMEN are putting on the finishing touches for the new opening. The wagon 
tarrives and SALVATORE and the USHER unload the projector.
<b>t
</b><b>t74  BEACH. IMPERIA ARENA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT.EVENING
</b><b>t
</b>tA sultry evening. The jacklights of the octopus fishers twinkle on the
tdark horizon. The sound-track of a comic film reverberates over the sea,
tthe laughter of the audience mingles with the sound of the shallow waves
tbreaking on the rocks. A group of LITTLE BOYS in a boat pulls away
tfrom shore. They join some more boats standing still in the water, all of
tthem crammed with LITTLE BOYS all looking in the same direction...
ttowards the screen of the open-air movie at the water's edge. There is a
tfunny scene.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLITTLE BOYS  
</b>ttAll seats are sold out! Free entrance 
ttand payment on the way out!! Sssssh!!
<b>t
</b>tAnd they guffaw noisily. Their laughter is echoed by more
tlaughter, in the distance...
<b>t
</b>t...the laughter of the Arena audience, scattered among the
tmetal chairs. By dint of laughing, the people in one of the rows
tof chairs tip over backwards. Screams, laughs, whistles.
tThe projection booth has a door at the back with stairs leading
tdown to the rocks. SALVATORE is sitting on the ground, bare
tchested, tired and sticky with sweat. He is reading a letter from
tELENA. He is so engrossed the words can almost be read on his
tface.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttELENA'S VOICE  
</b>ttt(Off-screen) 
ttSalvatore, my darling, here the days 
ttnever end. I find your name 
tteverywhere if I read a book, do a

ttCinema Paradiso.
<b>t
</b>tOn the Arena screen, with its potted plants and palm trees, a
tvery funny scene is being shown. The audience again bursts into
twild laughter. And the audience of LITTLE BOYS in the boats also laugh. One
tof them, laughing himself to tears, loses his balance and falls
tinto the water. The others howl with laughter. A voice rises up
tout of the carousel of boats.

</b><b>t
</b><b>t75  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b>tThe August sun is blazing hot. People are forced to stay inside when the sirocco 
tblows. The streets are empty. And there is a strange silence. Nothing can be 
theard except far in the distance, from somewhere in the country, the love song 
tof some carter...SALVATORE hears it too, stretched out on the floor of his 
troom, his eyes fixed on the ceiling where flies buzz around nervously. The 
tMAILMAN comes down the street on his bicycle, rides up to SALVATORE and hands 
thim a letter...Sitting in the shade of a white wall, SALVATORE reads the 
tletter. Next to him, the dog that kept him company at night, beneath ELENA's 
twindow. He gazes up at him as if looking for news of her.
<b>t
</b><b>t76:ARENA IMPERIA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT.EVENING
</b><b>t
</b>tThe Arena is crowded with sun-burnt faces. On screen, scenes from
tUlysses. On a shelf in the projection booth, there is an enormous pack of 
tletters. SALVATORE is worn out. The waiting has destroyed him. He looks
tlike a madman. As he winds up one of the parts of the film, he repeats
ther name obsessively, under his breath.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttElena...Elena...Elena...
<b>t
</b>tNow he is sitting outside on the back steps, a few yards from the
tsea. There is a breeze this evening, the waves are rather high and
tthe boats of 'gate-crashers' can be seen out in the water, rolling
tfitfully but not dangerously. SALVATORE stretches out, gazes up
tat the inky sky and talks to himself, just like a madman,
twhispering...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttWhen will this shitty summer be over? 
ttt(Half shutting his eyes) 
ttIn a film it'd already be finished...
ttt(Smiling)
tt...Fade-out and cut to a nice 
ttthunderstorm!!! Huh? that'd be 
ttperfect!
<b>t
</b>tA clap of thunder explodes in the air. Loud, rumbling. SALVATORE'S eyes pop 
topen. The Arena audience looks up in alarm at the sky...The 'gate-crashers' in 
tthe boats also look up and see a streak of lightning ushering in another clap of 
tthunder. One of those storms is building up that ruins late summer 
tnights. SALVATORE gives a contented smile as the cloudburst pours down 
tviolently, suddenly... The Arena audience scatters with a howl and scurries 
tover to the overhanging roofs of the projection booth, to take shelter and to go
ton watching the film despite the rain...
<b>t
</b>tThe LITTLE BOYS in the boats quickly pull tarpaulins over their
theads...But SALVATORE does not get up. He lets the rain fall on him,
tgoes on laughing, incredulous and stunned as if a real miracle had
ttaken place. And as he shuts his eyes and lifts his head up, to
tcatch more rain on his face, and gives himself up to that marvellous feeling of 
tjoy, a mouth comes to rest passionately on his lips it is ELENA. SALVATORE opens 
this eyes in utter amazement, it seems like a vision, another hallucination 
tcreated by the rain...Instead no, it is really her! 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttElena!...But when...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttELENA  
</b>ttI got back today. You can't imagine 
ttthe excuses I had to make up to be 
tthere...
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE's lips interrupt her. It is an intense, a stupendous kiss. They've 
tprobably never been so happy as they are at that moment. They cling to each 
tother as the rain goes on streaming over their bodies, mingling her hair with 
this, binding them ever closer.
<b>t
</b><b>t77  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tAutumn has arrived. In the streets, the PEASANTS prepare the barrels
tfor preserving the grape must. ALFREDO is sitting in front of the Cinema 
tParadiso with SPACCAFICO and the USHER. It is a quiet moment, they chat, while 
tthe humming of the projector and the sound track of the film can be heard 
tthrough the window of the booth. The MAILMAN stops and hands SPACCAFICO a folded 
tsheet of paper.

tELENA gives him a meaningful look through the window. SALVATORE returns the 
tlook, but stands there motionless, with a grim expression, like someone who 
tknows how to take the treacherous blows of life. The car drives off and with it 
tELENA. Their eyes hang on the same thread. The thread of hope and now of fear.

tthere is no sign of ELENA. SALVATORE stands nervously up in the window of the

tfull of film.
<b>t
</b>tThe first part is now about to finish, the reel is almost empty, and ELENA still 
tisn't there. SALVATORE is extremely nervous, worried, mortified by his meeting 
twith her FATHER. 
tHe sees ELENA's face pulling away in the car. Thinks back over her 
tterrible confession. He paces back and forth, as if he were in a prison cell, 
tthinking up solutions...The stair light finally goes on; there she is SALVATORE 
tdashes over and down the stairs to meet her. He comes down the final turn of the 
tspiral staircase and finds himself face to face with ALFREDO, who is slowly

trefuses to accept...

tthrough his whole body. He rings the bell, but nobody answers. A MAN who lives 
tin the building opens the front door and comes out. 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE seizes the chance and climbs up to the third floor. He pounds on the

ttThird Battalion, Ninth Company,

</b>tSALVATORE sneaks out of line, goes over and slips a letter into

<b>t
</b>tOn one of the public phones in a square of Rome, SALVATORE is phoning ELENA. 
tNobody answers. He slams down the receiver, as the line of SOLDIERS waits its 
tturn...
<b>t
</b>tNight-time. A large plastic bag full of water. A thud. SALVATORE wakes up with a 
tstart in a lake of ice water. He lets out a terrified shriek as the others 
tlaugh, protected by the dark.

</b>tSALVATORE is in the guardhouse. A cold, dark, filthy cell. His nerves start to 
tgive way. He bows his head in despair. 
<b>t
</b>tHospital. SALVATORE is exhausted, run-down. The night-stand is jammed with 
tmedicines. He lies in bed without moving, staring off into empty space, and 
trepeats obsessively in a low voice, as if talking to himself.

</b>tThe bus disappears around the corner leaving SALVATORE standing there alone. It 
tis a blazing hot day. The sirocco wind blows the yellow dust in all directions. 
tThe square is empty, the billboard in front of the closed movie house announces 
ta Western. SALVATORE puts his suitcase on the ground, looks around. Everything 
texactly the same, immobile. Only one new feature  in the cafe there's a jukebox 
tplaying 'Estate' sung by Milva. 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE turns towards the Cinema Paradiso. The projectionist is at the 
twindow of the booth, smoking a cigarette. Who knows who he is, where he came 
tfrom. A hot flurry of dust. SALVATORE turns and sees a dog leaping around kim, 
twagging its tail. It's the dog that kept him company during his nights beneath 
tthe window. SALVATORE gives a start of joy, drops his suitcase and leans over to 
tstroke him. Then he hugs him, as if he were an old friend.

</b>tThe sea is ruffled and the air is less sultry, easier to breathe. 
tSALVATORE and ALFREDO walk slowly along the waterfront. ALFREDO totters 
tslightly, holds on to SALVATORE, who is telling him something very funny. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttAt the Christmas party the lieutenant 
ttpinches a girl's ass. The girl turns

ttjust touched, I'm done for! 
<b>t
</b>tAnd they roar with laughter. They look like two old school buddies telling each 
tother dirty jokes. They stop beside a low wall. ALFREDO knows that those laughs 
tare simply a way of uselessly dancing around the countless things that are 
ttroubling SALVATORE. And he breaks the ice, while SALVATORE is still 
tlaughing.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO

ttof doing? 
<b>t
</b>tIt's a terrible question, and SALVATORE has no answer to it. In fact, would 
trather not even talk about it. He changes his tone, as if he hadn't heard it, 
tlaughs, trying again to ding to the funny jokes he heard during military 
tservice.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttListen to this one...The commander

ttt(And he bursts into 
tttnervous laughter. But this

tttunmoved, does not laugh 
tttwith him. SALVATORE 
tttgradually falls silent. He 
tttdoesn't know what to say. 
tttFor the first time in his 
tttlife, he doesn't know what 
tttgoal to aim for, doesn't 
tttknow what to do. The cloud

ttand the princess? 
ttt(ALFREDO nods his head.) 
<b>t

ttthat she was there waiting for him...
ttt(This time SALVATORE is 
tttthe one to explain

tttgentle smile) 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttNo, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! 
ttLife's not like you saw it in the

ttt(He lays his hand on 
tttSALVATORE'S shoulder, 
tttgives it a hard squeeze.) 
ttGet out! Go back to Rome. You 're

tcolorless on the horizon.
<b>t
</b><b>t95  VARIOUS SETTINGS. EXT/INT. NIGHT 
</b><b>t
</b>tNight. The square is empty. SALVATORE is sitting on the church steps. 
tHis head in his hands. He has to make a decision leave or stay. And why?... 
t'What decision will he make?' is the question that keeps ALFREDO awake, in his 
thot dark bedroom...
<b>t
</b>tMARIA, his mother, also can't get to sleep. She knows, senses, that her son is 
ton the verge of an important turning-point. But what will he decide? What will 
thappen?...
<b>t
</b>tAlso LIA, his sister, feels a strange, heavy tension in the air. And 
tdoesn't sleep. She's probably wondering where SALVATORE is at that 
thour... 
<b>t
</b>tHe's sitting on the ground. But even if he were to go to bed he wouldn't 
tsleep. He rubs his face with his hand. The church bell chimes four a.m...
<b>t
</b>tALMOST THIRTY YEARS LATER, another distant bell is chiming four a.m. And 
tSALVATORE is once again wide awake. He is thinking, with his hand on his face, 
tjust like then. And the same decision to make: what to do? Stretched out beside 
ta sleeping WOMAN, he goes on staring at the window. Outside, the storm has 
tpassed. The long memory has almost faded, only the sound of a train surfaces in 
this mind...
<b>t
</b><b>t96  GIANCALDO RAILWAY STATION. EXT. DAY

tof his home town before leaving for Rome. SALVATORE hugs his

tALFREDO. The old man is deeply moved. A heart-rending trembling
tcomes into his husky voice. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttALFREDO  
</b>ttDon't come back any more, don't think 
ttabout us, don't turn round, don't

</b><b>t
</b>tTHIRTY YEARS LATER, a plane flies over Sicily. It lands on the 
trunway char seems to emerge from the sea and flatten out towards the slopes of 
tthe dark mountains. Salvatore's face appears among the clouds reflected in one 
tof the plane windows. He has the tense look of the man who suddenly comes home 
tafter the adventure of life has carried him afar, wandering the world, where he 
thas forgotten everything. From the plane window to another window...
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>t...the window of the taxi-cab driving SALVATORE to his home town. The scenery 
tmoving by on either side of the road summons up sweet memories. A lot of things 
thave changed, but the colors are still the same. The yellow running through the 
tentire landscape is unmistakable. And all those black birds perched in a row on 
tthe guard-rail are crows. 
<b>t
</b>tThe cab now approaches the outskirts of Giancaldo. But if the sign, 
thadn't been there with the name on it, it could be an entirely different

tsweater. Her hands move very swiftly, almost mechanically.

tshort. That is what she has been waiting for. She mumbles in excitement. 
<b>t

</b>ttIt's Toto...I knew it...
<b>t
</b>tAnd she scrambles to her feet, dropping her knitting in the chair, one needle 
tdangling over the edge. She hurries off, forgetting that she still has the ball 
tof white yarn in her apron pocket. And the yarn runs off the needles and the 
tknitting comes undone quickly as she moves about the house, goes down the stairs 
tto the front door.   
<b>t

tttMARIA opens a door, steps 
tttaside to let her son in, 
tttwhispers:) 
ttI put all your things in here. Go in, 
ttgo in...
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE lakes a few steps, is flabbergasted at the sight of his old room 
tperfectly reconstructed and preserved. It looks like a museum, the museum of the 
tpast. Despite the bed, the clothes in the cupboard, the books on the shelves, it 
tis perfectly clear that no one has ever lived in it and never will live in it. 
tMARIA senses his perturbation, remains standing in the doorway as if to leave 
thim alone...SALVATORE goes over to the bed, looks around  the old 8mm movie 
tcamera, the projector, his documentaries, the bicycle hanging on the wall, the 
tphotographs of his favorite movie stars. But what mostly catches his eye is a 
ttiny framed photograph: SALVATORE as a little boy and ALFREDO, standing smiling 
tin front of the Cinema Paradiso. Strange, at that time ALFREDO was younger than 
the is now! It's as if he were standing there before him one last time. That 
timpressive figure, his good-natured bur firm look, touches his heart. From 
tALFREDO'S smiling face to...
<b>t
</b><b>t101  GIANCALDO. MAIN STREET AND SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b>t...the coffin where his old blind friend rests for ever. The funeral
tprocession winds its way down the main street. At the intersections, , 
tcars stop to let the black hearse pass by. People cross themselves. The old men 
tremove their hats. Store shutters are lowered. Then, when the procession has 
tpassed by, the cars start up again, the old men put their hats back on, the 
tshutters are pulled up. 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE is in the front row with his MOTHER, next to ALFREDO'S WIDOW. 
tSIGNORA ANNA says in a whisper, her eyes fixed on the coffin.  
<b>t
</b><b>ttttANNA  
</b>ttHe would have been happy you came, 
ttToto. He always talked about you. 
ttAlways! Right to the end! He was 
ttterribly fond of you...
ttt(Tears come to her, she is 
tttunable to say any more. 
tttSALVATORE gives her a hug, 
tttdeeply touched by her 
tttwords.) 
ttHe left two things for you. Come see 
ttme before you leave. 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE nods his head. He gazes intensely at the coffin covered with flowers 
tand is grieved as if he were ashamed never to have come to see the man who had 
tbeen like a father to him. But why had he forgotten him? Up in front, leading 
tthe procession, he sees a young PRIEST with an altar boy beside him, and these 
tfigures are also like chisels scraping the rust off his soul and bringing old 
tfeelings to light again. 
<b>t
</b>tThe procession reaches the square. The dark column stands etched in the dazzling 
tearly-afternoon light. SIGNORA ANNA motions the driver and the procession comes 
tto a halt. It is ALFREDO'S last farewell to the place where he had spent the 
tbest years of his life  the Cinema Paradiso. Everyone turns to look and 
tSALVATORE also turns, taken by surprise...It has fallen to pieces: doors and 
twindows boarded shut, crumbling walls, a piece of the sign dangling down, weeds 
tand mildew in the cracks and on the roof. The square has changed completely, is 
tunrecognizable. Buildings, stores, sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a 
tsnail's pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns. And the central square has 
tturned motorcycles. SALVATORE turns slowly to look behind him, towards the small 
tcrowd, and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at 
tonce, despite the many years that have gone by:  the MAN AT THE BOX OFFICE, the 
tUSHER who also served as bill-poster, the CHARWOMAN, the CARABINIERE SERGEANT, 
tand further on behind ROSA and ANGELO, the lovebirds who had met in the movie 
thouse and then got married. They all have white hair. And they too have 
trecognized him, give little hello nods and gestures. Another face 
the seems to recognize: why sure, it's SPACCAFICO, the owner. How old he's 
tbecome! He also looks up and his eyes meet SALVATORE'S. A hello nod. 
tSALVATORE makes his way over to him through the crowd. They shake hands 
theartily, without a word, both touched. The procession starts up again. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttt(Under his breath) 
ttHow long's it been shut? 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSPACCAFICO  
</b>ttSix years ago this May. No one came 
ttany more. You "know better than me, 
ttMr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, 
ttvideos. By now the movie business is 
ttonly a dream. The city's bought it 
ttnow to make a new parking lot. Next 
ttSaturday they're 
tttearing it down...A pity!...
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE is disconcerted, irritated by that 'Mr. Di Vita'. Besides, finding 
tout that the movie house is to be torn down depresses him, after all, it's a 
tpiece of his life...And all those curious faces staring at him.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttBut why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? 
ttIt didn't used to be that way...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSPACCAFICO  
</b>ttWell, it's hard to call an important 
ttperson by his first name. But if it 
ttreally matters to you, I'11 call 
ttyou...
ttt(Smiling) 
ttToto!...
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE smiles at that. Meanwhile, the procession has reached the church. 
tSALVATORE excuses himself and goes over to the hearse. Old SPACCAFICO watches 
thim go, then says, almost to himself) 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSPACCAFICO  
</b>ttBless you, Toto. 
<b>t
</b>tThe coffin is unloaded. SALVATORE has asked to be one of the 
tbearers into the church. As he moves off slowly with that weight 
ton his shoulder, somebody catches his eye on the other side of the sidewalk. An 
told woman, sixty or seventy years old, with a plastic bag in her hand. She 
tcrosses herself quickly. SALVATORE recognizes her  she was the one he made love 
twith for the first time. TERESA, the prostitute. The coffin is carried into the 
tchurch, followed by the little procession. 
<b>t
</b><b>t102  SALVATORE' S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. EVENING 
</b><b>t
</b>tThe little house is sunk in the darkness of evening and the ground floor
twindows are lit up. The rustling of the sea can be heard. The family is having 
tsupper. The table is set with the finest silver and the company china has been 
tbrought out. LIA is also there with her husband, ALFIO, and their two children. 
tFILIPPO, fifteen, and SARA, thirteen. The television is on, but the sound has 
tbeen turned practically all the way down. SALVATORE'S presence arouses a special 
texcitement. The children look at their uncle with a certain awe, after all they 
tdon't really know him. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSARA

ttFine. But I warn you, there isn't

tnever seen her laugh like that, amused, at peace.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttFILIPPO  
</b>ttYou leaving tomorrow, Uncle? 
<b>t

tupheavals, a series of almost overwhelming emotions and now he knows nothing  on 
tthe one hand, he' d like to stay, let himself drift on the sweet tide of family 
tlife, be completely carried off by the rolling waves of his own past: on the

tand light wrinkles line her face. 
<b>t
</b>tThen he looks at her husband, ALFIO, he's going bald but he tries to hide it by 
tcombing over the little hair left. Who knows what their marriage is like, he 
twonders. He looks back at LIA, and it's as if she sensed it, she looks up, 
tguesses the nature of his thoughts, imagines what he is trying to figure out, a 
tblush colors her cheeks and she smiles. SALVATORE returns a conniving smile.
tThe ringing of a phone. SARA starts to get up to go and answer it, hut MARIA 
tstops her with a glance of the eye.

</b><b>t
</b>tThe TRAFFIC cops are trying to break the front door down with their
tshoulders. Once, twice, and at last, the door flies open with a screech, 
tkicking up a cloud of dust. SALVATORE enters by himself...
<b>t
</b><b>t104  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b>tSALVATORE'S silhouette stands out against the light in the open door. S lowly he 
tmakes his way into the empty theatre. A thick layer of dust lends everything a 
tgray, rarefied look. The light streaming in from the windows up above teems with 
tstrange mates of dust, like a haze. 
<b>t
</b>tCobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling. SALVATORE walks down the middle 
taisle. The rows of seats are unhinged, what was once the wooden veneer has 
twarped from the dampness. He looks around as if he Were thumbing through the 
talbum of his memories.  
<b>t
</b>tThe screen dangles from its frame. The emergency exits are boarded 
tand nailed shut. Observing the emptiness of the theatre, SALVATORE 
thas the feeling he can hear the howling, the whistling and voices of the . 
taudience, as he remembers it. But only for one brief moment, then the silence 
treturns. A mouse creeps along one wall, stops near a pile of dust. SALVATORE is 
tattracted by that little gray mass. He goes over as the mouse scampers off, 
ttakes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lion's head covered with 
tdust. He moves it with his foot, then looks up at the projection booth, 
trepeating the same gesture of bygone years. But the lion's head is no longer 
tthere, only the outline of it on the wall, and cobwebs have covered the hales of 
tthe booth, those little square openings that had caused him such long suffering 
tas a little boy...SALVATORE now climbs up the spiral staircase. Each step kicks 
tup a little cloud of dust. 
<b>t
</b>tThe little booth, yellow with fumes, appears before him again. Now it 
tlooks like some big, empty cave. The projector is no longer there, nor 
tthe equipment. Who knows where they junked them?! The only thing left is a clump 
tof film strips still attached to the wall: trailers, Part One 
tendings, etc...There he had kissed ELENA for the first time, and
tstrips of film like those had grazed their faces. Now they are caught up
tin the coils of cobwebs. And where the film-winder once stood, the
tnails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts. Of all the films 
tshown at the Cinema Paradiso Palace. And three more boxfuls of 
tthem are on the floor. 
<b>t
</b>tAnd the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass   
tbroken. SALVATORE peers out of one of the cracks in the window and
tsees the village...which is now a city. A different world he no longer 
tknows. 
<b>t
</b><b>t105  CAFxc9 IN SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY

</b>tThe cafe in the square has been completely renovated. The CASHIER and BARMEN 
thave young, unfamiliar faces. SALVATORE holds out the receipt with a tip. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttA double whisky, please. 
<b>t
</b>tSeveral BOYS are sitting at the comer tables, talking about girls. Others stand 
tplaying 'war games', shake around to the obsessive strains of same electronic 
ttune. 
<b>t
</b>tA man comes up to SALVATORE and asks for his autograph. Then SALVATORE turns to 
tthe plate-glass window overlooking the main street, where the workers' club once 
twas. And like a flash, a shudder freezes him to the spot.... Two steps away 
tfrom 
thim, through the glass, a stunning vision, which casts him beyond time, chills 
this blood: there before him is ELENA! But she is still young, young as she was 
tthen! Sweet, luminous, alluring, exactly the way he saw her the first time at 
tthe station. 
<b>t
</b>tShe is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her 
tarm...Have the passing years had no effect on her? Or is she an hallucination? 
tNo! It's a dream! Or is he dead too, like ALFREDO? SALVATORE doesn't know how to 
texplain it. And he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic. His glass drops to 
tthe floor...As the GIRL walks off... 
<b>t
</b><b>t106  GIANCALDO. STREET. EXT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b>tAt the age of fifty-five, SALVATORE feels no scruples about wandering
tthe streets of his home town, spying from a distance on an eighteen- year-old 
tgirl. There's nothing he can do about it. He stares at her with the amazement of 
tsomeone who discovers that miracles exist. Now he is nearer to her. How lovely 
tshe is! It's her, no doubt about it! Exactly the same. Except she has a 
tdifferent hair-do and is wearing different clothes:  ELENA didn't wear slacks. 
tThe GIRL goes up to a parked motorcycle. She removes the padlock and fastens her 
tbooks to the rack. SALVATORE is standing there a few steps away, and without 
tstopping to think, moves a little closer, discreetly, politely.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>tThe old shots of ELENA getting off the train and walking away, casting a curious 
tlook at the camera...SALVATORE is watching her again, projected on the white 
twall of his room. He also watches the other shots of those happy long-gone days  
tthe picnic,. she at the beach, smiling, joyful...And again SALVATORE doesn't 
tunderstand, or doesn't want to understand. But these scenes could have been shot 
tyesterday, so identical to ELENA is the girl he saw on the street...And the 
twound which he thought had healed years ago, starts bleeding again. 
<b>t
</b>tThe lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever 
tknowing why, and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his 
tyoung mind, start slipping through his soul again, like those shots 
tslipping again through an old 8mm projector. 
<b>t
</b>tThrough the crack of the door, MARIA sees those images on the wall, SALVATORE 
trocking his head back and forth slowly, like he used to do as a boy when he 
tcried. She somehow feels his grief, his bitterness, lowers her eyes and walks 
taway without a word, as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank, 
tempty...And SALVATORE sits there gazing at it, as if he saw other scenes which 
this camera never set down on film, only his memory. 
<b>t 
</b><b>t108  HIGH SCHOOL. STREETS AND LITTLE SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
</b><b>t
</b>tThe HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS are coming out after school. Happy young faces. That 
tGIRL 's motorcycle can be seen in a rear-view mirror. SALVATORE is at the wheel 
tof the car ALFIO has lent him. He has obviously followed that motorcycle before. 
tHe waits with an eagerness he thought he had long lost, a determination to 
tunderstand, to get to the bottom of the matter, which frightens him and at the 
tsame time overwhelms him hopelessly. 
<b>t
</b>tAnd here she comes. She unlocks the padlock and prepares to speed off. SALVATORE 
tstarts the motor and follows her a short distance away. The GIRL heads for the 
tnew residential district on the outskirts. 
<b>t
</b><b>t109  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY

</b>tMARIA is setting the table. LIA and her family are eating at her 
thouse today. SALVATORE is sitting again, with a lighted cigarette, 
tgazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the 
trolling sea. The air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a 
theaviness to the silence, like the troubled look on his face. MARIA glances at 
thim. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttWhat are you thinking, Toto? 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE looks at the old woman's lovely face, a faint smile. on his lips. 
tThere was always something like an unspoken rule between them, the rule of 
tsilence, of unconfessed complicity. And now he feels that rule has to be broken. 
tHe speaks quietly, as if to curb the tumult of his feelings of guilt.

ttbut I would have later...
<b>t
</b>tMARIA doesn't answer, but she is not troubled. An inner peace lends her a sweet, 
tquiet expression. Then she too agrees to break the rule of silence. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARIA  
</b>ttI never had anybody. If that's what 
ttyou think...I didn't want anybody. I

ttt(SALVATORE is immersed in

tttnothing. The silence is 
tttbroken by the ringing of 
tttthe phone. A menacing 
tttsound, which SALVATORE 
tttcannot bear. He knows they

tthe already overflowing ashtray.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSALVATORE  
</b>ttt(Whispering) 
ttNo...It's nothing to do with you. 
ttIt's just that I was scared of coming

ttfind it's quite the opposite, as if I 
tthad never left. And yet, I look at 
ttLia and feel as if I didn't know her,

ttran away like a thief, thought only 
ttof myself, and never gave you

ttOnly one thing made me suffer: 
ttbolting the door shut before going to

ttfelt as if I had left somebody

tttand entranced by the 
tttpoetry of her way of 
tttspeaking...)

trealizes she has always known everything. But he doesn't' answer her. 
tThey look at each other a Long time without speaking. Their rule of conniving 
tsilence has come back into play, as before, forever. It is her expression that 
ttells him to leave, to take the plane and fly away...

</b>tThe GIRL'S motorcycle is parked in the courtyard beyond the gate of a small 
thouse. He is studying it from inside the car parked in a corner of the small 
tsquare, near a cafxe9. Re has been there some while, but is not nervous, waits 
tthere with determination...
<b>t
</b>tSeveral windows in the house are lit, but no one can be seen through 
tthe curtains. Nothing but shadows pass by every now and then. Now the light in 
tone of the windows goes out, and the light on the stair goes on. The front door 
topens and the GIRL comes out with a tall, sturdy- looking, elegantly dressed 
tGENTLEMAN around fifty. 
<b>t
</b>tThey converse bur are too far away for their voices to be heard. SALVATORE 
twatches them come out the gate and climb into a car. They look like father and 
tdaughter. The car now drives off and passes right by him. A gleam of light, 
tthe reflection from the headlights, falls on the GENTLEMAN'S face. He recognizes 
thim at once, from the birthmark on his temple...

</b>ttt(Mumbling) 
ttHis last name was Lo Meo, Vincenzo. 
<b>t

tthen disappears... 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE is at a loss, sits down at one of the rabies near the 
tphone in the almost empty cafe. At the far end, a group of five people watching 
ttelevision.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBARMAN  
</b>ttYou want something? 
<b>t
</b>tAnd he turns back to the television. SALVATORE lights a cigarette. He is 
tuncertain. Once again he has to lake an important decision  redial the number 
tand seek a face behind that shadow? Or forget the whole thing, the GIRL, BOCCIA, 
tthe shadow, and go away? Yes, best go away. He gets up and leaves. He can be 
tseen through the window turning the comer. A pack of cigarettes and a lighter 
tlie on the table, he has forgotten them. And the lighted cigarette bums down in 
tthe ashtray. A few moments have gone by. Footsteps, and a hand picks up the 
tlighter and the cigarettes. It is SALVATORE who now, on a sudden urge, slips 
tanother token into the slot. The shadow reappears at the window. The same voice 
tas before.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>tSALVATORE stands motionless on the pier, facing the storm-tossed sea. He feels 
trelieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts, blurs them, 
tbut does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes. A flashing light seems 
tto approach behind his back. SALVATORE turns and is blinded by the headlights of 
ta car parked at the beginning of the pier. The splattering waves lend the scene 
ta hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights. Now the lights 
tmove towards him. And SALVATORE also lakes a few timid steps forward... 
tThey are close. The car has almost stopped. But it is impossible to make out the 
tperson at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door. A voice can be 
tbarely heard over the raging sea. It is ELENA's voice. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttELENA  
</b>ttSalvatore! 
<b>t
</b>tSALVATORE approaches, accepting the invitation, enters the car and shuts the 
tdoor. The headlights go off and the car remains there suspended between the open 
tsea and the harbor with its rocking boats. Inside the car, not a word. Two dark 
tfigures gaze at each other, unintelligible, as if the night were trying to 
tfurther delay that meeting. The glowing reflection of a wave higher than the 
tothers now lights up their faces. ELENA was right, they are no longer the faces 
tof teenagers, but of people on in years who study each other, searching for a 
ttruth. The howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder, but 
tELENA and SALVATORE /rear nothing, sit glued to their seats, fixed in the 
tendless gaze that envelops them. He is the first to break the silence in a faint  
tvoice.

</b>tSALVATORE turns on the light of the rear-view mirror. Finally 
tthey can see better. They look at each other a little ill at ease, 
tmaking the inevitable comparisons with the memory of their young faces. 
tSALVATORE carefully observes her graying hair, her blue eyes lined 
twith wrinkles, the somewhat faded beauty mark on her lip.

<b>t
</b>tThe white foam of the waves splashes up over the wall of the pier, dashing 
tagainst the car windows. The shadow of the trickling water is superimposed on 
tthe agony of their faces. ELENA hides her embarrassment beneath a faint but 
thaughty smile.
