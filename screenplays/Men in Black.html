<b>EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT
</b>
A million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an
insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides
effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air.

The insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS
unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down
the road.

<b>INT. VAN -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT
</b>
The DRIVER of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers,
smearing the remains all over.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttGoddamn bugs.

He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but
now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight
of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.

He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He
speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled.

<b>ttttDRIVER (CONT'D)
</b>ttDeja me hablar.
ttt(Let me do the talking.)

<b>EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT
</b>
The van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue
four doors with "INS" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS
stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward
and comes to the window.

The DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also
government issue, looks at him and sighs.

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttWell. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where
ttyou comin' from?

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttI was fishing in Cuernavaca.

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttSure you were. What do you say we have a
ttlook at your catch?

<b>AT THE BACK OF THE VAN,
</b>
the Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED
MEXICANS, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus
looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his
head.

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttMe, I woulda thrown 'em back.
ttt(to the passengers, in Spanish)
ttVamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina!
ttt(Let's go. Out. Form a line!)

They pile out of the van. Some are parents with small children.

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhat do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a
tthead?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all
ttfor your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna
ttneed --

He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching,
fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several
Agents pull their weapons.

The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS
cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their
headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD.

TWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple
black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of
world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach
the INS agents.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWe'll take it from here.

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttWho the hell are you?

Kay and Dee flash some form of ID.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttINS Division 6.

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttDivision 6? I never heard of Division 6.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttReally?

Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhat're we thinking, Dee?

<b>ttttDEE
</b>ttTough call, Kay.

He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in
Spanish.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>tt!Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey!
ttt(What's up, how are you?)
ttNo se preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los
ttEstados Unidos.
ttt(Don't worry grandma.
tttWelcome to the United
tttStates.)
tttt(next)
ttA donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo,
ttno? Buena suerta.
ttt(Where are you going? San
tttAntonio?  Looking for
tttwork, aren't you?  Good
tttluck.)
tttt(next)
ttEs un placer verle aqui.
ttt(It's a pleasure seeing
tttyou here.)

One by one, their faces relax, reassured by Kay's calm demeanor. When he
reaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but:

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttQue dices si te rompo la cara?
ttt(What do you say if I
tttbreak your face?)

The Guy smiles and nods. Kay stops. His own smile broadens and he drops a
hand on the Guy's shoulder.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttNo hablas ni una palabra del Espanol,
ttverdad, amigo?
ttt(You don't speak a word
tttof Spanish, right, friend?)

Again, the Guy smiles and nods. Kay looks back at Dee.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe got a winner.
ttt(to the others)
ttLos restos estan libres a irse. Largense!
ttt(The rest of you are free
tttto go. Scram!)

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttSir!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttTomen el camion, y vayeuse.
ttt(Get on the road and go.)

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttSir, you can't just --

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttDon't "Sir" me! You have no idea who you're
ttdealing with!

Silence on the road. The Driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the
van. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(to Janus)
ttWe're gonna have a little chat with our
ttfriend here. You boys can hit the road ...
ttand keep on protecting us from dangerous
ttaliens.

Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise,
leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway.

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttYou ever heard of Division 6?

<b>tttt2ND INS AGENT
</b>ttThere is no Division 6.

<b>tttt3RD INS AGENT
</b>ttWho are those guys?

<b>EXT. DESERT CLEARING - NIGHT
</b>
Kay and Dee lead their captive into a clearing in the desert brush. Dee
pulls an enormous handgun from a shoulder holster and stays a pace or two
off, covering him. Kay has an arm draped around the man's shoulders.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI think you jumped off the bus in the wrong
ttpart of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet
ttdollars to pesos that you're not --

He pulls out a small laser device, which he ZIPS neatly down the front of
the man's clothes.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>tt-- from anywhere near here.

The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is
underneath -- A SCALY SPACE BASTARD, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with
a snouth, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at
the top of his head.

The only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the
humanesque "head," which he still lamely holds in one of his hands. It's
propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions
as he holds it.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttMikey?! When did they let you out of jail?

MIKEY replies -- an unfathomable combination of GRUNTS, SQUEAKS, and
saliva.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttPolitical refugee. Right.

<b>ttttDEE
</b>ttYou know how many treaty articles you've
ttjust violated?

Mikey makes a lame SQUEAK.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttOne, my ass. Try seven.

<b>ttttDEE
</b>ttFrom unauthorized immigration to failure to
ttproperly inoculate prior to landing.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(off Mikey's objections)
ttOkay, that's enough. Hand me your head and
ttput up your arms.

From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP.

Kay and Dee both look over quickly. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall
stalk, whips around too. All three of them see AGENT JANUS, standing just
over the rise, staring in frozen amazement.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttAh, shit.

Agent Janus SCREAMS. Mikey rips free of the rest of the "Mexican"
disguise, knocks Dee out of the way, and takes off straight at Janus,
SCREECHING a horrible Space Bastard screech. Janus freezes, terrified.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttDee! Shoot him!

Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell
out of his hand as he hit the ground.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttDee, for Christ's --

Mikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to Janus quickly. He steps
on a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide
open --

-- there is a SIZZLING sound, a brilliant white flash --

-- and Mikey ERUPTS in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the
ground, the trees, and Agent Janus' face. Behind where Mikey was, Kay
stands, smoking weapon in hand.

<b>EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT
</b>
On the road, the INS AGENTS pull their guns and run toward the rise.

<b>EXT. DESERT CLEARING -- NIGHT
</b>
Kay has an arm around Janus, whom he is leading further into the clearing.
Janus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars.

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttTh -- th -- th --

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(helping)
tt"That."

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttThat wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHuman, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on
ttyou.

He takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the Agent's face. As he does,
Janus looks back to where Mikey blew up. Then at Kay. And then up at the
stars.

The other INS Agents burst over the rise, SHOUTING questions.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttOkay, everybody, situation's under control,
ttcalm down. If you'll just give me your
ttattention for a moment I'll tell you what
tthappened.

From over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start
to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular
metallic device the size of a pocket recorder. He checks his watch,
figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the
device up to "08."

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttThis is called a "neuralyzer." A gift from
ttsome friends from out of town. The red eye
tthere isolates and measures the electronic
ttimpulses in your brain. More specifically,
ttthe ones for memory.

Behind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses,
come over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttGimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;
ttholes at 40, 60, and 80.

<b>tttt2ND INS AGENT
</b>ttWhat in the hell is going on?!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttExactly the right question. And the answer
ttlies right -- here. Pay attention.

<b>ttttJANUS
</b>ttWho are you, really?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttReally? I'm just a figment of your
ttimagination.

He holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay reaches
into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses --

-- and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a
tenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs. They stare blankly.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttGod, we're a gullible breed.

Behind him, TONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the
Men in Black. Kay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming
around, as if awakening from a concussion.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttI mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be
ttalive after a blast like that.

The Agents look around, confused.

<b>ttttAGENT JANUS
</b>ttWhat -- blast?

Kay gestures behind him, where the Men in Black are now using fire
extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttUnderground gas vein, genius. You guys need
ttto exercise more caution before discharging
ttyour firearms.

He jabs a finger into Janus' chest.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttEspecially you.

Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at
the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away
from the group and finds him. He sits down next to him.

<b>ttttDEE
</b>ttI'm sorry. About...back there.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHappens.

<b>ttttDEE
</b>ttDidn't used to.

He holds up his hands, which tremble with age.

<b>ttttDEE (CONT'D)
</b>ttThe spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of
ttme...

He looks up, at the million stars shining overhead.

<b>ttttDEE (CONT'D)
</b>ttThey're beautiful, aren't they?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttDEE
</b>ttThe stars. We never just -- look. Anymore.
ttt(back to Kay)
ttI'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase.

Kay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNo. You won't.

<b>EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- SOUTHERN EXPOSURE -- NIGHT
</b>
A shot of the clock on the Station's stately southern exposure. WE PAN
<b>DOWN TO...
</b>
A pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the
PERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME.

A new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC
COP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet
behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up.

Edwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a
chain under his shirt.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttStop! NYPD!

He continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other COPS,
overweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air.

<b>ttttCOP
</b>ttAll yours, Edwards!

The Cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes.

<b>TRACK WITH EDWARDS AND THE PERP
</b>
As they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low Forties.
The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's
a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail, and drops to Forty-first
Street below.

EDWARDS is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn't waste a second. He,
too, hurdles the guard rail and lands on...

<b>EXT. 41ST STREET AND PARK AVENUE - NIGHT
</b>
A DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown
traffic. The bus, of course, is completely filled with JAPANESE TOURISTS,
and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.

EDWARDS pushes through the crowd...

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttGrand Central Station off to your left,
ttfolks...

With the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs
out through the side door.

He spots the Perp, sailing east on Forty-first Street.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttDammit, man, you're making me sweat up my
ttgear!

Edwards spots one of those New York Post delivery trucks, the kind with
the open back door, rumbling by.  He runs and jumps into the back.

<b>EXT. FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT
</b>
THE PERP, meanwhile, is running at top speed, when Edwards glides into
frame, leaning off the back of the truck.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttYo, man, your luck just ran out.

He leaps from the back of the moving truck and tackles the Perp.

The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.

<b>ttttPERP
</b>ttHe's coming! He's coming!

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttAnd when he gets here, I'll kick his ass
tttoo.

Edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the Perp blinks. Nothing
unusual about that, but then another set of translucent, milky white
eyelids, underneath his regular eyelids, blinks also.

Edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the Perp needs to
pull out...

His WEAPON, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen. Reacting
quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand.

THE WEAPON smashes into the stone wall surrounding Central Park and
SHATTERS into a million pieces.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWhat the...

WHOMP! The Perp kicks him in the nuts, then scrambles to his feet and
takes off again. Edwards staggers after him, in pain.

The Perp leaps over a moving car, towards the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM. Edwards
tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the
Perp is gone.

<b>EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- NIGHT
</b>
Edwards runs over to the Museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it,
and in the next instant...

The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of
the Guggenheim. He scrambles up and over the ledge.

Edward reacts. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open and
runs inside.

He runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim.

<b>EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- ROOF -- NIGHT
</b>
On the roof, the PERP reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and CRUNCHES
to the gravel surface. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It's
locked.

He tugs on another. It's locked too. He pulls on a third. It swings open --

-- revealing EDWARDS on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon
at the Perp.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWassup?

The Perp SCREAMS inhumanly and panics. He backpedals, toward the edge of
the roof.

<b>ttttPERP
</b>ttHe's coming! He's coming because I failed,
ttand now he'll kill me too!

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttStop!

<b>ttttPERP
</b>ttYou don't understand. Your world is gonna
ttend.

But the Perp has backed right into the edge of the roof, and now he starts
to fall over. The Perp blinks.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWhat are you?!

The Perp looks down. He decides.

-- and he falls, SCREAMING, to his death.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
EDWARDS sits on one side of the table, a POLICE INSPECTOR and a UNIFORMED
SERGEANT (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit
across from him.

<b>ttttINSPECTOR
</b>ttPerpetrator then blinked two sets of
tteyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttNo, sir. He blinked once with one set, then
ttagain with another completely different set.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttSort of a low beam, high beam.

<b>ttttINSPECTOR
</b>ttWas that before or after he drew the weapon
ttwhich you claim evaporated into a million
ttpieces?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttAfter, sir.

<b>ttttINSPECTOR
</b>ttAnd why do you suppose none of the other
ttofficers saw either of these two events?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>tt'Cause some of the other officers are a
ttlittle soggy in the midsection. And they
ttcouldn't keep up, sir.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttHey, Edwards, if you were half the man I
ttam --

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWhat do you mean? I am half the man you are.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttWhat the hell is your problem?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttMy problem is you being all up in my damn
ttface all the time.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttI think he threw him off the roof. Ten
ttminutes -- your best shot.

<b>ttttINSPECTOR
</b>ttt(cutting off the Sergeant)
ttSergeant. I want to talk to you outside.
ttNow.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttYou need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you
ttpudgy bastard.

<b>INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT
</b>
A woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish,
dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above
him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and
saw a spaceman (which she did).  She looks over her shoulder once, then
whispers to him.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttLaurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I
ttbelieve you. I opened him up. Find me at
ttthe morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I
ttfound.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttHey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttt(turning at the door)
ttYou have really pretty eyes.

She hurries to turn the corner, but is STOPPED by someone who remains just
offscreen.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttDr. Weaver, from the coroner's office?
ttWorking on the John Doe?

Edwards twists in his chair, to get a better look. All he sees is Laurel,
facing whoever it is in the hallway.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttYes. That's right.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttWould you look right here, please.

The Someone says something else and Laurel steps forward, now also out of
Edwards's line of vision.

<b>ttttLAUREL (O.S.)
</b>ttLook where?

Edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding FLASH
from the corridor. Really curious now, he starts to get up --

-- when KAY steps into the room and closes the door behind him. Edwards
rolls his eyes.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttSome night, huh?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttOh, yeah, some night.

He crosses to the door.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThey were gills.

Edwards stops.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNot eyelids.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWho are you?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttDid he say anything to you?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttt(scoffing)
ttYeah, sure. He said the world was coming to
ttan end.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttDid he say when?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttYou're kidding, right?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWould you recognize his weapon if you saw
ttit again?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttAbsolutely.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttLet's take a ride.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttIt's all done.

At that point, the INSPECTOR sticks his head in, smiles and gives Edwards
the thumbs up.

<b>ttttINSPECTOR
</b>ttGood work, Edwards.

Edwards looks at the Inspector, then at Kay. As they leave.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou ran that guy down on foot? That's tough.
ttThat's double tough.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. FORD LTD - A MOMENT LATER - DRIVING
</b>
In a plain, boxy Ford, Kay drives, silent. He raises his hand and nods to
a black MIB truck coming in the opposite direction.Edwards, in the
passenger seat, is still in his undercover outfit.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttSo who you with?

Kay says nothing.

<b>ttttEDWARDS (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou got the plain clothes, the
ttgovernment-issued wheels. Secret Service?
<b>ttCIA?
</b>
Kay remains utterly silent.

<b>ttttEDWARDS (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(referring to the car)
ttYeah, well, whoever it is, you're short on
ttfunding.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNothing is what it seems, kid.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttOh, yeah, my bad '86 Ford LTD. That's a
ttluxury ride. C'mon, who ya with?

Kay pulls the car to a stop.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI'm part of a secret organization that
ttmonitors and polices alien activity on earth.

Kay opens the door and gets out of the car. Edwards follows.

<b>EXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
Edwards looks around. Sees they're standing in front of a PAWN SHOP.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttThis is where we're going?

They get out of the car.

<b>ttttEDWARDS (CONT'D)
</b>ttJack Jeebs? Guy buys from chain snatchers.
ttDoesn't even sell guns.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttReally?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttAll right, you think it's worth shaking him
ttup, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some
ttanswers.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttDo your "thing," kid.  Edwards goes inside.

<b>INT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
JACK JEEBS is the sleazy, sarcastic proprietor of the Pawn Shop. He's not
easily intimidated.

<b>ttttJEEBS
</b>ttOfficer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these
ttget here? I thought I turned 'em in to the
ttproper authorities.

He casually brushes some Rolexes off the counter.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWay I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a
ttlittle hotter than some stolen Rolexes.

<b>ttttJEEBS
</b>ttSure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just
ttwork here because I love the hours.

This pisses Edwards off. He grabs Jeebs by the collar.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttt(getting angry)
ttI'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech
ttstuff.

<b>ttttJEEBS
</b>ttC'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.

<b>ttttKAY (O.S.)
</b>ttWhy don't you show him the imports, Jeebs.

At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming
over his face.

<b>ttttJEEBS
</b>ttH-hiya Kay, how are you?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThe imports, Jeebs. Now.

<b>ttttJEEBS
</b>ttYou know I got outta that business a long
tttime ago, Kay.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhy do you lie to me? I hate it when you
ttlie.

He pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead.

<b>ttttJEEBS
</b>ttWhoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI'm going to count to three.

Edwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttHe'll do it, Jeebs.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttOne.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttI've seen him do it.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttTwo.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttTalk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's
ttlike this.

<b>ttttJEEBS
</b>ttHe's always crazy.
ttt(to Kay)
ttTake a cruise. Get a massage --

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThree.

KA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor.
Edwards is shocked.

Edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay's head.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttPut down the gun and put your hands on the
ttcounter!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI warned him.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttDrop the weapon!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou warned him.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttYou are under arrest. You have the right to
ttremain silent.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWill you relax?

<b>ttttJEEBS (O.S.)
</b>ttt(irritated)
ttDon't do that.

Edwards whirls around to see Jeebs' BODY, growing another head. Only takes
four or five seconds. Kay calmly shoves his gun up against Jeebs'
baby-soft new cheek.

<b>ttttJEEBS (CONT'D)
</b>ttDo you know how much that hurts?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttShow us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up
ttanother one.

Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which
promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with
junk --

-- but this is all alien junk. Weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly
weapons of all shapes and sizes.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttEdwards?

Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the
weapons.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttUh, this. This is what I saw.

Kay looks at Jeebs, pissed off.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity
ttto an unlicensed cephlapoid.

<b>ttttJEEBS
</b>ttHe looked all right to me.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttA carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs.
ttWho was the target?

<b>ttttJEEBS
</b>ttI don't know.

Kay raises the weapon again, threatening.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttJeebs!

<b>ttttJEEBS
</b>ttI don't know!

Kay lowers his gun, gestures to the shelf full of weapons.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThis is all confiscated. All of it. I want
ttyou on the next transport off this rock. Or
ttI'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.

Jeebs nods, point taken. Kay leaves.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttYeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.

Shaken, Edwards follows.

<b>EXT. PAWN SHOP -- NIGHT
</b>
Edwards staggers out of the shop, trying to get the day's events straight
in his head.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttThe eyelids, fine ... and the jumping thing
tt... and the gun ... okay, but the head?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttSearching for a handle on the moment here?
ttA place to file all this.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttSee a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just
ttgrow back.
ttt(looking up)
ttWhat's going on?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttCan't help you, kid. Only comfort I can
ttoffer is that tomorrow, you won't remember
tta thing.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttOh, no. This I'm gonna remember for a long,
ttlong time.

Kay pulls the neuralyzer from his pocket. He hesitates for the briefest of
moments -- as if this particular neuralyzation is different than all the
others.

Then he puts on his sunglasses.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttEver see one of these?

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
-- the flash dims on EDWARDS and KAY, sitting at a table in a Chinese
restaurant.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(finishing a joke)
tt-- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know,
ttbut this one's eating my popcorn!

He busts out laughing. Edwards, across from him, is completely
disoriented. He looks down. There's a half-eaten order of broccoli beef
and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttHuh?

Kay checks his watch.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWhere am I?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttSee what I mean about tequila? You're a
ttbright young man, James. Just lay off the
ttsauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m.
ttsharp.

He turns and walks out. Edwards checks his watch. A WAITRESS appears.

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>ttAnother beer?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttCoffee. Please.

She walks off. Edwards looks at the table. There is a business card lying
next to his plate, on which Kay has handwritten "James D. Edwards,
Saturday, 9 a.m., 504 Battery Drive."

Edwards looks at it, puzzled. He turns the card over and looks at the
other side. There's not much there, no name, no phone or fax number, no
e-mail address. Just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card:

<b>ttttMIB
</b>
<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate New York farm
country. Several lights are on and through a window we can see the
silhouette of a MAN sitting at the kitchen table, the silhouette of a
WOMAN hovering over him, bringing things to him.

The Man (EDGAR) waves his arms, ranting.

<b>ttttEDGAR (O.S.)
</b>ttI go out, I work my butt off to make a
ttliving, all I want is to come home to a
ttnice clean house with a nice fat steak on
ttthe table, but instead I get this -- this
tt-- I don't even know what you call this!

In the sky above, it's one of those brilliant star fields. But something
strange is happening with one of those stars -- it's getting bigger.

<b>ttttEDGAR (O.S.)
</b>ttI'll tell you what it looks like, it looks
ttlike poison. Don't you take that away, I'm
tteating that, damn it! It is poison, isn't
ttit?!

No, that star isn't getting bigger, it's moving. Toward us. Fast. It goes
from a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way
into fruit metaphors.

<b>ttttEDGAR (O.S.)
</b>ttI swear to God, I would not be surprised if
ttit was, the way you skulk around here like
tta dog been hit too much -- or ain't been
tthit enough, I can't make up my mind.

Okay, we're way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it's starting
to glow hot red as it enters the earth's atmosphere, headed straight
toward us, coming here, to Beatrice and Edgar's place.

The blazing fireball barrels through the sky, SNAPS off a couple trees --

<b>ttttEDGAR (O.S.)
</b>ttYou're useless, Beatrice! The only thing
ttthat pulls its weight around here is my
ttgoddamn truck!

-- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A
concussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts.

<b>ttttEDGAR (O.S.)
</b>ttStay here!

The silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws
it open. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty,
bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun. His mouth agape, he
walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck.
The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering
hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttFigures.

He walks to the truck and touches the door handle. Hot. Using his shirt
tail, he opens the door and peers down into the hole.

IN THE HOLE, he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights.
Embedded into the ground is, indeed, a spaceship, maybe eight feet across.

BEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully.

<b>ttttBEATRICE
</b>ttWhat is it, Edgar?!

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttt(turns to her)
ttGet your big butt back in that house!

Beatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. Edgar turns back
to the smoldering rock, raising his shotgun in defense. AN OTHERWORLDLY
VOICE comes from deep in the hole.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttPlace projectile weapon on ground.

Edgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises
the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttYou can have my gun when you pry it from my
ttcold, dead fingers!

There is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer. Finally, it
responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttYour proposal is acceptable.

A long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and
pulls him down into the hole.

From deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet
being torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment
later, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to
the truck.

It's Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face,
arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now
he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the
prom.

The shotgun flies out and lands beside him.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears
from Edgar's diatribe. The door opens and EDGAR comes back into the
kitchen, seemingly fleshed out again, leaving the door hanging open behind
him. He carries the shotgun.

She looks up at him, anxious. But his face is a blank.

<b>ttttBEATRICE
</b>ttWhat on earth was it?!

He looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than
before. More refined.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttSugar.

Pause. She looks out the window, at the smoking truck.

<b>ttttBEATRICE
</b>ttI've never seen sugar do that.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttGive me sugar.

Puzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar.
She holds it out to him.

<b>ttttEDGAR (CONT'D)
</b>ttIn water.

Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. She dumps some of
the sugar into it.

<b>ttttEDGAR (CONT'D)
</b>ttMore.

She puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a
knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling.

Edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no
idea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck.

<b>ttttBEATRICE
</b>ttEdgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just
tthanging off your bones!

Edgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He
reaches up --

-- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, then tucks the
skin of his neck back into his shirt collar.  He looks at her.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttThat better?

Beatrice faints.

<b>EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Stillness. Silence. A loud SCRAPING sound comes from the pit left by the
spaceship.

The nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit, wavers, keeps moving,
and finally CRUNCHES to the ground outside the pit.

EDGAR climbs out of the pit, breathing heavily. He dusts himself off and
continues pushing the ship, along the ground, off into the darkness.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. MIB BUILDING - DAY
</b>
The next morning. EDWARDS, holding the small MIB business card in his
hand, compares the address written down by Kay to the address on the
utterly nondescript building in front of him. It's seven stories high,
gray, windowless, perfectly square, squatting on a bridge over a road like
a fat guy on the john.
ttt   "504 Battery Drive."

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY
</b>
EDWARDS steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre
room. One wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel
vent air intake. There is an elevator at the far end of the room and an
OLD SECURITY GUARD, the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding
metal chair halfway across.

Edwards walks across the room, his footsteps ECHOING. The Guard looks up.

<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttHelp you?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttMaybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --

<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttElevator. Push the "call" button.

And he goes back to his comic book. Edwards, maybe out of nothing more
than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator.
As he draws close, the elevator doors WHOOSH open, expecting him.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - ENTRANCE ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
Edwards steps inside and turns around. The doors close. He pushes the
"call" button and waits, but the elevator doesn't move. Instead, doors on
the other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him. Edwards
waits, unaware.

From behind him, somebody clears their throat. Edwards turns around, and
finds himself standing in --

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</b>
This back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway.
Standing at the front of the room is ZED, a wire-haired career G-man, an
old school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit Kay had on last
night. SIX OTHER HOT RECRUITS sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at
Edwards.

One chair is empty.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttYou're late. Sit down.

Edwards takes the remaining chair. The elevator doors slide shut. Zed
continues addressing the Recruits.

<b>ttttZED (CONT'D)
</b>ttMy name is Zed. You're all here because
ttyou're the best of the best. Marines, Navy
ttSEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.

They all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly. He gives it back.

<b>ttttZED (CONT'D)
</b>ttAnd we're looking for one of you. Just one.
ttWhat will follow is a series of simple
tttests designed to quantify motor skills,
tthand-eye coordination, concentration,
ttstamina -- I see we have a question.

Edwards's hand is, indeed, up.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWhy, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one
ttreally asked this, but -- why, exactly, are
ttwe doing this?

Silence. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand. Zed calls
on him.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttSon?

<b>ttttAMBITIOUS RECRUIT
</b>ttt(loud and formal)
ttJake Jensen, West Point, graduate with
tthonors. We're here because you're looking
ttfor the best of the best of the best, sir!

Edwards tries to stifle a laugh, but can't.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttWhat's so funny, Edwards?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttI -- I don't know, sir. This guy. "Best of
ttthe best of the best of the best of the --"
ttt(realizing nobody is with
ttthim on this)
ttIt just struck me as --
ttt(totally serious)
ttHumorous. Sir.

Short pause. Then Zed continues.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttOkay. Let's get going.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER - DAY
</b>
The recruits scribble away at the written test. It's a thick document --
reasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams.  The RECRUITS seem to be
really powering through it, filling in answer after answer.

But no desks have been provided for them, and they're all still in their
chairs, writing uncomfortably on their thighs or knees.

EDWARDS is really struggling. He writes two words on one answer, then
decides to erase it. The lack of a writing surface is driving him crazy;
his pencil even TEARS through the page.

He looks up. In the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table.
Edwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold --

-- and drags it, SCREECHING DEAFENINGLY, back to his chair. Everybody
looks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room.

Edwards sits back down, now writing on the table.  That's better.

Zed raises an eyebrow. He stares at Edwards, then looks up, toward a
smoked glass window. Behind the dark glass, a FIGURE stands, staring,
unemotional.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MIB BUILDING -- SHOOTING GALLERY -- DAY
</b>
SEVEN WEAPONS rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty,
triangular room. The SEVEN RECRUITS stand in front of the table.

There's an odd moment -- where everyone sort of looks around: at each
other, at the blank walls...

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttAnyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're
ttdoing here?

<b>ttttMARINE
</b>ttt(clipped, unquestioning)
ttLooking for the best of the best of the best.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttt(can't help but smile)
ttWell, yeah, I know, but...

And then .. suddenly --

The two far walls pull apart. The whole room pulsates and the air is
suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images, both
human and alien. Everywhere is color, light and movement -- a holographic
mass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously.

The Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim. SIX
SHOTS are fired at once. And then, a second later, a SEVENTH SHOT is
fired. Everyone sort of looks at Edwards, who puts his gun down last.

There's an awkward silence. Then the door opens. Light pours in, and ZED
with it. Even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some
sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttThe hell happened?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttHesitated, sir.

Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of
creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in
its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a
large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back
corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty
eight-year-old girl.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttMay I ask why you felt little Tiffany
ttdeserved to die?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttShe was the only one who actually seemed
ttdangerous. At the time.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttAnd how did you come to that conclusion?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttHook-head guy. You explain to me how he can
ttthink with a hook for a head. Answer; it's
ttnot his head. His head is that butt-ugly
ttbean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you
ttlook at the snarling beast-guy, he's not
ttsnarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues
ttin his hand. No threat there, and anyhow,
ttthe girl's books were way too advanced for
ttan eight-year-old's. And besides, from
ttwhere I'm looking, she was the only one who
ttappeared to have a motive. And I don't
ttappreciate your jumping down my throat about
ttit.

Sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed sighs.

<b>ttttEDWARDS (CONT'D)
</b>ttOr, uh -- do I owe her an apology?

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</b>
ZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are
still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttHe's got a real problem with authority.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttSo do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed.
ttOn foot. Tenacity. That I can use.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttI hope you know what you're doing.

Zed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who
stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group.

Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and
into the shooting gallery. As he talks, Kay turns and walks off.

<b>ttttZED (CONT'D)
</b>ttCongratulations, you're everything we've
ttcome to expect from years of government
tttraining. Now, if you'll just follow me, we
tthave one more test to administer, an eye
ttexam.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
The RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long
hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of
the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway.

KAY is outside the door, waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last
night.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttYou! Hey, what's goin' on?

The other recruits continue down the hall with Zed. Kay doesn't answer,
just gestures to Edwards to follow him down the hall, which he does.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttBack in the mid-fifties, the government
ttstarted a little underfunded agency with
ttthe simple and laughable purpose of making
ttcontact with a race not of this planet.

As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have
been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from
his pocket.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttNow, if you'll look directly at the end of
ttthis device.

He holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare
obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses.

Edwards stares, fascinated, but Kay's hand reaches in and yanks him away,
just as Zed's neuralyzer FLASHES WHITE.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
As KAY leads EDWARDS down an impossibly long corridor, he hands him a file
folder stuffed thick with eight by ten photographs.

He hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine MEN in plain black
suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and
fluorescent lights. DEE and ZED are there, much younger.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttEverybody thought the agency was a joke.
ttExcept the aliens. They made contact on
ttMarch 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.

Another photograph, a grainy black and white image of two ships hovering
in the night sky -- classic flying saucer shapes.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttThere were nine of us that night. Seven
ttagents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor
ttkid who got lost on the wrong back road.

Yet another photograph, this one showing a young KAY, in a shirt and tie,
holding a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of the landed
flying saucer. ALIEN SHAPES are visible within.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttYou brought the aliens flowers?

Kay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as
the first.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThey were intergalactic refugees with a
ttsimple request. Let us use the earth as an
ttapolitical zone for people without a
ttplanet.  Ever see "Casablanca?" Same thing,
ttno Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all
ttevidence of their landing.

Another picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under
construction. Giant models of rockets mark the Fair's theme of space
travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the
flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttThe 1964 World's Fair was a coverup?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhy else would we hold it in Queens?
ttt(another hallway)
ttNow left. More nonhumans arrive every year.
ttThey live among us, in secret.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttI see. Not to change the subject, but when
ttwas your last cat-scan?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttEvery six months; it's company policy.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWell, thanks for the very amusing morning,
ttbut I'm hopin' you'll show me where I came
ttin?  'Cause this is where I go out.

They have stopped next to an unmarked door. Kay throws it open and steps
inside.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee
ttwhile we're right here.

As Kay walks into the kitchenette, Edwards' jaw drops, his eyes widen, and
he stares in wonderment --

-- at THREE WORM-LIKE ALIENS standing around a water cooler. Tall,
impossibly thin, most certainly not from New York, the aliens hold an
animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of
Esperanto and microphone feedback.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(to the aliens)
ttDon't tell me we've only got that powdered
ttshit for cream again?

One of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to
the counter.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttOh.

He finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated,
dumps some in his coffee, and comes back outside, closing the door behind
him. He reaches up and gently pushes Edwards' jaw up, closing his mouth.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttFor future reference, this is a better look
ttfor you.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY
</b>
EDWARDS, thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside KAY on a
bench in Battery Park. Kay drinks his coffee while they talk.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAny given time, around fifteen hundred
ttlanded aliens are on the planet, the
ttmajority right here in Manhattan. Most
ttaliens are decent enough, just trying to
ttmake a living.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttCab drivers?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNot as many as you'd think. Humans, for the
ttmost part, don't have a clue. Don't want
ttone, either. They're happy. They think
ttthey've got a pretty good bead on things.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWhy the big secret? People are smart, they
ttcan handle it.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttA person is smart. People are dumb.
ttEverything they've ever "known" has been
ttproven to be wrong. A thousand years ago
tteverybody knew as a fact, that the earth
ttwas the center of the universe. Five
tthundred years ago, they knew it was flat.
ttFifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans
ttwere alone on it. Imagine what you'll know
tttomorrow.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttSo what's the catch?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhat you'll gain in perspective, you'll
ttlose in ways you're too young to comprehend.
ttYou give up everything. Sever every human
ttcontact. No one will know you exist. Ever.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttNobody?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou're not even allowed a favorite shirt.
ttThere.  That's the speech I never heard.
ttThat's the choice I never got.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttHold up. You track me down, put me through
ttthose stupid-ass tests, now you're trying
ttto talk me out of it. I don't get it.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou got 'til sun-up.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttIs it worth it?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou find out, you let me know.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. BATTERY PARK - DUSK
</b>
Almost nighttime now, and the park is empty. EDWARDS is still on the
bench. And still thinking. Above him, the stars are coming out.

Slowly, he looks up, into the vastness of the heavens.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. GARAGE - DAY
</b>
The next morning. A door opens on a garage and an ORKIN MAN steps inside,
carrying a tank of toxic gas. The morning light spills on an abundance of
spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them
have moved in and taken over this dusty place.

The Orkin Man sighs and sets down his tank.

<b>ttttORKIN MAN
</b>ttWell, well, well. Movin' right in, are we?
ttThink we own the place?

He unfurls a hose from the side of the tank.

<b>ttttORKIN MAN (CONT'D)
</b>ttGot a little eviction notice for you, boys.

He raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the
tank. LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttJust what exactly do you think you're doing?

The Orkin Man turns around. EDGAR stands in the doorway to the garage,
staring at him disdainfully.

<b>ttttORKIN MAN
</b>ttt(shrugs)
ttTakin' care of your pest problem.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>tt"Pest" problem? "Pest?"

<b>ttttORKIN MAN
</b>ttYeah. You got a hell of an infestation.

Edgar advances on him, slowly.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttYou know, I have noticed an infestation
tthere. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing
ttbut undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious
ttpond scum. So convinced of their own
ttsuperiority as they scurry about their
ttshort, pointless lives.

<b>ttttORKIN MAN
</b>ttWell -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of
tt'em?

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttIn the worst way.

Edgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the Orkin Man's face with
one hand --

-- and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other.

THE ORKIN MAN'S CAR KEYS drop to the garage floor, and Edgar picks them
up.

<b>EXT. GARAGE - DAY
</b>
A six-by-ten sheet of plywood THUDS to the driveway outside the garage.
EDGAR raises one end of it so it's hanging off the back end of the Orkin
man's van -- now it's a ramp.

He walks off and we hear that familiar SCRAPING sound again. Edgar,
GRUNTING with the effort, slowly pushes his spaceship up the ramp and into
the back of the Orkin truck.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY
</b>
EDWARDS stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room, the same one he
first came into yesterday. The elevator doors open and KAY, obviously
summoned by the OLD SECURITY GUARD, stands waiting for him.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttOne thing you gotta know right now.

Edwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with Kay.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
Inside the elevator, the doors WHOOSH shut, KAY turns a key in a certain
floor number, and the descent begins. EDWARDS continues.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttAll right. I'm in because there's some
ttnext-level shit going on around here, and
ttI'm with that. Before you beam me up, there
ttare a couple of things we need to get
ttstraight. You chose me 'cause you recognize
ttthe skills. So as of now you can cease with
ttall of that calling me "son" or "kid" or
tt"sport." Cool?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttCool, slick. Now about those skills of yours,

The elevator doors --

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY
</b>
-- slide open on Men in Black headquarters.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAs of this moment, they don't mean much.

It's unlike anything we've ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties
design, polished steel and glass. The workplaces are sleek and
uncluttered, manned by both HUMANS and ALIENS. Most of the Aliens stay in
the background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling,
shuffling papers.

KAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out
over the whole place.

Kay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of
passport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking
the documents of a line of ALIENS who've just arrived. There are a dozen
bizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien
tongues.

Edwards slows as they pass, listening to the PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER as
he addresses an ARQUILLIAN, a large, humanoid visitor.

<b>ttttPASSPORT OFFICER
</b>ttPurpose of trip?

<b>ttttARQUILLIAN
</b>ttDiplomatic mission.

<b>ttttPASSPORT OFFICER
</b>ttDuration of stay?

<b>ttttARQUILLIAN
</b>ttLunch.

<b>ttttPASSPORT OFFICER
</b>ttCarrying any fruits or vegetables?

Edwards just stares, fascinated, but Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries
him along.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttLet's go. He's a little...grouchy.

Kay moves him into the central hall.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttA couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year
ttflight would get on anybody's nerves.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWhat branch of the government do we report
ttto?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNone. They started asking too many questions.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttSo who pays for all this?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttOh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we
ttconfiscated from our out-of-state visitors.
ttVelcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.

AT A STORAGE CAGE, Kay turns a key in the lock of a caged-in area and
throws the door open. Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking
devices stacked on shelves and tabletops.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(picking something up)
ttHere. A new recording device to replace
ttCD's.  So now I gotta buy the White Album
ttagain?
ttt(something else)
ttThis is amusing. Universal translator.

He holds up a cylindrical metal tube and a small wire clip that looks like
a lapel microphone.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe're not supposed to have it. I'll tell
ttyou why.  Human thought is so primitive
ttit's considered an infectious disease.
ttMakes you proud, doesn't it?

Edwards picks up a small yellow ball from one of the shelves.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttWhat's this?

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttDon't touch that!

THE BALL ZINGS OUT OF EDWARDS' HANDS -- it flies out into the main complex
-- hits the ceiling and ricochets around the room, faster than the eye can
follow --

VARIOUS SHOTS OF HUMANS AND ALIENS ducking, dodging, and jumping out of
its way.

ON KAY as he calmly, a little wearily, slips an odd-looking metal glove
over his right hand...

He raises his hand and the yellow ball zings into it -- Kay catches the
ball, calmly.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttCaused the '77 New York blackout. Practical
ttjoke by the Great Attractor. He thought it
ttwas funny as hell.

They leave the room.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttSorry!

ON THE MAIN FLOOR, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant
screen on the far wall.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttObservation, the heart of our little
ttendeavor.

The screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights
blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttThis map shows the location of every
ttregistered alien on earth at any given
tttime. Some of them we keep under constant
ttsurveillance.

He hits a button on the console and the map is replaced by hundreds of
boxes, each with smaller video images.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttEveryone on these screens is an alien. In
ttpublic -- normal. In private -- you'll get
ttthe idea.

ON THE SCREENS, we see live images of aliens. Aliens who look alien are in
spots where they can't be seen.  Aliens who look human are functioning
right out in public -- including SAM DONALDSON. MICHAEL JACKSON. And TONY
<b>ROBBINS.
</b>
<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttMeet the twins.

Kay gestures to two small, bony CREATURES with eight arms each and a
single eye growing out of a central stalk in their heads. They turn around
and wave two or three arms each.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttI gotta be honest about something.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttIt makes no sense?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttIt makes perfect sense. When I was a third
ttgrader in Philadelphia, they told me I was
ttcrazy 'cause I swore that our teacher was
ttfrom, like, Venus or something.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMrs. Edelson.

Edwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots her onto the screen: Mean
face, cat glasses. Bony fingers. Extremely well-hidden tail.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttJupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.

With their remaining arms, they punch button after button on the enormous
console. ZED, who was standing up close to the screen, walks over to
Edwards, sizing him up.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttWhat's your jacket size, Edwards?

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttUh -- forty regular.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttThen let's put it on.

<b>ttttEDWARDS
</b>ttPut what on?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttThe last suit you'll ever wear.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY
</b>
Like the rest of the place, the MIB locker room is all white. White walls,
white floor, white ceiling, white lockers. ZED'S VOICE comes over:

<b>ttttZED (O.S.)
</b>ttFrom now on, you'll dress only in attire
ttspecially sanctioned by MIB Special
ttServices.

EDWARDS reaches out and opens a white locker, revealing a BLACK SUIT hung
from a hanger in the middle. Above it, on the shelf, a BLACK HAT and a
pair of BLACK SUNGLASSES. On the bottom, a pair of SHINY BLACK SHOES.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY
</b>
KAY is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate,
driver's license, social security card, library card, everything. ZED'S
VOICE continues:

<b>ttttZED (O.S.)
</b>ttYou'll conform to the identity we give you,
tteat where we tell you, live where we tell
ttyou, get approval for any expenditure over
tta hundred dollars.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING LASER BOOTH - DAY
</b>
EDWARDS stands in a cramped white booth.

He holds both his hands on a TEN-FINGERED KEYPAD, pressing down hard. The
pad glows red, a SEARING sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as
more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints.

<b>ttttZED (O.S.)
</b>ttYou will have no identifying marks of any
ttkind.  You will not stand out in any way.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY
</b>
One by one, KAY deletes Edwards's identity cards.

On the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- JAMES DARREL EDWARDS III.
Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to
left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name.

<b>ttttZED (O.S.)
</b>ttYour entire image is carefully crafted to
ttleave no lasting memory whatsoever with
ttanyone you encounter.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY
</b>
Pants come off the hanger. The white shirt is removed.

More letters are eliminated from his name. It reads "JAMES DARREL ED..."
then "JAMES DARR..."

<b>ttttZED (O.S.)
</b>ttYou're a rumor, recognizable only as deja
ttvu and dismissed just as quickly. You don't
ttexist; you were never even born.

The coat is removed. The hat comes off the shelf.

<b>ttttZED (O.S.)
</b>ttAnonymity is your name. Silence your native
tttongue.

<b>"JAMES..." "JAM..."
</b>
<b>ttttZED (O.S.)
</b>ttYou are no longer part of "the system."
ttWe're above the system. Over it. Beyond it.

Feet slip into black shoes. A belt is buckled. A tie pushed up.

<b>ttttZED (O.S.)
</b>ttWe're "them." We're "they."

On screen, all that's left is the letter "J."

As the coat is buttoned, we notice the sleeve. Monogrammed on the cuff is,
simply, the letter "J."

<b>ttttZED (O.S.)
</b>ttWe are the Men in Black.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY
</b>
Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, JAMES D EDWARDS
III -- or, rather, JAY -- steps into the doorway from the locker room. He
reaches into his pocket, takes out the sunglasses, and looks at KAY.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttThe difference between you and me?

He slips on the sunglasses.

<b>ttttJAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttI make this look good.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. NEW JERSEY - EARLY MORNING
</b>
We are looking at a telephoto shot of Manhattan in all its splendor.

We see the Orkin van topping a hill, heading towards Manhattan.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - ZED'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of
MIB headquarters. JAY and KAY sit across the desk from Zed. There are five
video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another
Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock
ticking in a corner of the image.

While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttOkay, let's see.
ttt(to one of the monitors)
ttBee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of
ttSinalee touching down in the forest outside
ttPortland tonight. I'm pulling you down from
ttAnchorage to do a meet-and-greet.

BEE, an agent on one of the monitors, nods.

<b>ttttBEE
</b>ttHumanoid?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttYou wish. Bring a sponge.
ttt(going through memos)
ttWhat else -- everybody, we gotta keep
ttRolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system,
tthe's scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat
ttwants to reveal himself on "Unsolved
ttMysteries." Bee, make sure he doesn't.

He turns a page, coming across a red memo.

<b>ttttZED (CONT'D)
</b>ttRed-letter from last night -- we had an
ttun-authorized landing somewhere in upstate
ttNew York farm country. Keep your ears open
ttfor this one, Kay, we're not hosting a
ttgalactic kegger down here.

Next to him, his computer screen BEEPS importantly.  Zed looks over at it.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttWell, well, well -- we got a skimmer.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(to Jay)
ttLanded alien out of zone.
ttt(to Zed)
ttWho is it?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttRedgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan
ttbut he's way out of town right now, stuck in
tttraffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why
ttdon't you take Jay? This is a good one for
tthim to warm up on.

<b>EXT. MIB BUILDING - BATTERY PARK - DAY
</b>
JAY and KAY come out the front of MIB headquarters.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYo, wussup with Zed?
ttt(imitating him)
tt"Go get em, tiger. We're not hosting an
ttintergalactic kegger..."

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttZed was saving the world before you were
ttborn, son. Show some respect.

An MIB MECHANIC pulls up in Kay's black LTD and hops out, leaving the door
open. Jay sizes up the car.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWe got the use of unlimited technology from
ttthe entire universe and we cruise around in
ttthis?

Kay glares at Jay. He's getting annoyed.

<b>INT. MIB LTD - DAY
</b>
They get in and slam the doors. Kay starts the car and the engine HUMS
quietly.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttSeat belt.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to
ttpeople. You could be a little kinder and
ttgentler.

Kay grits his teeth.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttBuckle up, please.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttNow did that hurt?

Kay shifts the car into reverse. The awesome power of the car kicks in and
Jay sails forward, THWACKING into the dash. Kay shifts into forward and
taps the gas, SLAMMING Jay back into his seat.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMakin' fun of my ride...

A LIGHTED PANEL rotates into place between the two front seats.  Jay's
hand falls by accident on a flashing red button in the panel.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttJay. The button?

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNever push the button, Jay.

Jay jerks his hand away.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY
</b>
The LTD is now stopped by the side of the road, dust swirling around it.
Ahead of it, another car has pulled over. KAY gets out, JAY follows a
moment later, shaky-legged. Kay walks up to the window of the car they've
stopped. The DRIVER, a guy in his mid-thirties with a WIFE in her
mid-thirties, rolls the window down.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttLicense and registration, please.

The Driver hands over some documents. Kay flips through them.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttOther license and registration, please.

The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. Jay peers over
Kay's shoulder.

The photographs on the "RESIDENT ALIEN ID"cards are of two
friendly-looking reptile types, husband and wife, smiling atthe camera,
their long, skinny tongues dangling in a friendly sort of way.

Kay hands them back.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttYour resident card has you restricted to
ttthe five boroughs only. Where do you think
ttyou're going?

<b>ttttREDGICK
</b>ttIt's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!

Kay leans down and looks in the window. MRS. REDGICK is in front, MOANING
in pain, holding her swollen belly. Kay straightens up, fast.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttOh God. How soon?

Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS in pain. Real soon. For the first time since we've
seen him, Kay is nervous.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttOkay. All right. No big deal.
ttt(to Jay)
ttYou handle it.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttMe?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttSure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.

Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS again. Redgick gets out of the car, worried.

<b>ttttREDGICK
</b>ttAre you sure he knows what he's doing?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time.
ttC'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask
ttyou something.

Kay gives Jay a supportive SLAP on the back and leads Redgick away, to the
rear of the car. Jay stays in the background and opens the rear door,
tentatively. He leans down, into the car.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttOh God! I see it I see it I see it!

A few yards from the car, Kay turns Redgick to face him.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttCroagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th.
ttYou were headed out of town.

<b>ttttREDGICK
</b>ttWell, we're, uh -- meeting someone.

Suddenly a TENTACLE whips out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, CRACKS the
whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttOh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see
ttthat?!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(still to Redgick)
ttSo? Who you meeting?

<b>ttttREDGICK
</b>ttWell, it's -- a ship.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttReally? I didn't see a departure clearance
ttfor today.

<b>ttttREDGICK
</b>ttYou didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.

Now a SECOND TENTACLE whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and
pulls tight. He GASPS, choking.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttGuys -- guys --

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttDoin' fine, Ace.
ttt(back to Redgick)
ttWhat kind of emergency? What's the rush to
ttget off the planet all of a sudden?

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttt(choking to death)
ttHelp?! HELP! Hello?!

He starts tugging for all he's worth, but the fight is sort of going
against him, as the tentacles pull him in even harder than he tries to
pull the baby out.

<b>ttttREDGICK
</b>ttWe just don't like the neighborhood anymore.
ttSome of the -- new arrivals.

Redgick looks at Kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes
away.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhat new arrivals? This have anything to do
ttwith the crasher from last night?

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttt(Screaming)
ttCan you guys do this later?!

But in that moment, Jay finally gets a foot up on the door frame, acquires
leverage, and RIPS the baby free. He falls, flat on his back in the dirt,
the multi-tentacled lizardlike baby resting squarely on his chest.

<b>ttttJAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttOh -- oh -- oh -- man.

Kay turns and claps Redgick on the back.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttCongratulations! It's a lizard.

Jay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttt(misty)
ttHey, you know, it is sorta --

It vomits on him.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIB LTD - DAY
</b>
Back in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY
starts up the car.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAnything about that seem unusual to you?

Jay just looks at him, very Jack Benny.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttPick.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhat kind of "new arrival" would scare
ttRedgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump
ttwith a newborn?
ttt(thinks)
ttLet's check the hot sheets.

<b>EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY
</b>
CLOSE ON on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them.
There are headlines like "POPE A FATHER!"and "TOP DOCTORS BAFFLED -- BABY
BORN PREGNANT!" and "MAN EATS OWN HOUSE!" (the subhead on that one is "And
That's Just the Appetizer, Says Neighbor.")

KAY and JAY are at a downtown newsstand. Kay is furiously searching
through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttThese are the hot sheets?

Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy
a buck.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttBest damn investigative reporting on the
ttplanet.  But hey, go ahead, read the New
ttYork Times if you want. They get lucky
ttsometimes.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou're actually looking for tips in a
ttsupermarket tabloid?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNot looking for. Found.

He SMACKS the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned
open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for
the Second Coming:

ttt     Farm wife says
<b>tt     "ALIEN STOLE MY HUSBAND'S SKIN!"
</b>
<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - ORKIN VAN - DAY
</b>
A flap of skin, now getting gray and crusty with age, hangs off EDGAR's
neck as he sits in the front of his Orkin van. He sucks as hard as he
possibly can on a straw stuck into a Jolt Cola ("Double the Sugar! Triple
the Caffeine!"), one of a six-pack that sits on the dashboard.

Across the street, Edgar sees a short, older man come out of one of the
jewelry shops on Thirty-Fifth Street. Edgar drops the soda and stares.

The Older Man (ROSENBERG), is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood
jewelry box. Carefully, he sets the box down and lovingly places the cat
on top of it while he locks all five locks on the door to his distinctive
shop.

That finished, he picks up the cat, then the box, then waddles off down
the street, one under each arm.

Edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him, slowly, trolling along
behind him.

ON THE STREET, Rosenberg walks happily along, HUMMING to himself. He gives
his cat a little peck. As he rounds a corner, we recognize the tune he's
humming -- "I've Got the Whole World In My Hands."

The Orkin van rounds the corner behind him. Following.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
</b>
The LTD pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway that leads to
Beatrice's farmhouse, where the alien ship landed. The wrecked pickup
truck is still there. JAY and KAY get out, very undercover cop. Jay starts
up the driveway.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNot so fast. Walk up slow.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttPart of the routine. Makes it look like
ttwe're sizing up the situation. Gives her
tttime to get the wrong impression.

BEATRICE appears in the door to the house, curious.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttPuts some fear into her. Makes things go
ttsmoother.

Beatrice calls to them.

<b>ttttBEATRICE
</b>ttCan I help you gentlemen?

Beatrice looks much better than the last time we saw her -- more nicely
dressed, a touch of makeup, a smile on her face.

Kay pulls a black card from his wallet and extends it to her as she draws
close. As she reaches for it, the card reforms into an FBI badge.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHow do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent
ttManheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a
ttfew questions about your visitor.

<b>ttttBEATRICE
</b>ttAre you here to make fun of me too?

In the living room, KAY sips some of her lemonade and winces. JAY moves
through the room, checking it out as BEATRICE tells her story.

<b>ttttBEATRICE
</b>ttAnd they said to me, "If he was murdered,

ttone. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him.
ttIt was more like something else that was
ttwearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.

A little GIGGLE escapes her at the thought. Jay, over by a bookcase,
notices a framed PHOTO OF EDGAR, kneeling in the woods, proudly about to
skin a deer.

Kay nods, puts on his sunglasses. Takes out another pair, hands them to
Jay.

Kay draws his neuralyzer. FLASH! Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead
as if hypnotized. Kay takes Jay's glasses off and hands them back to him.

<b>EXT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY
</b>
ROSENBERG, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing
district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. He heads into
Leshko's, a Russian diner.

A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street.

<b>INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY
</b>
ROSENBERG comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative
darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an
enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid
fifties.

Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. The
man (an ARQUILLIAN, and if we're eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien
on a "diplomatic mission" from passport control) rises from his chair. He
steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table.
Immediately, ROSENBERG'S CAT jumps on top of it.

Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment --

-- and then embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to
it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and
both seemed choked with emotion.

Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre
alien tongue, which is subtitled. Rosenberg wipes away tears.

<b>ttttROSENBERG
</b>ttSorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this
ttplanet are terrible.

<b>ttttARQUILLIAN
</b>ttYour majesty, you are in grave danger.

<b>ttttROSENBERG
</b>ttYeah, and they overcharge you every time.

<b>ttttARQUILLIAN
</b>ttSir, a bug landed here. We must get you off
ttthe planet.

<b>ttttROSENBERG
</b>ttA bug? He must know why I'm here.

<b>ttttARQUILLIAN
</b>ttWe think he does.
ttt(noticing the ornate box
ttton the table)
ttIs that what I think it is?

<b>ttttROSENBERG
</b>ttNo, just some diamonds for your children.
ttDo we have time to eat?

The Arquillian relaxes.

<b>ttttARQUILLIAN
</b>ttSure. I ordered you some pirogi.

<b>INT. LESHKO'S DINER - KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
In the kitchen, the Russian COOK slaps two orders of pirogi up on the
stainless steel counter --

<b>ttttCOOK
</b>ttTable six is up!

-- and turns away, back to the grill.

A HAND reaches in, takes the plates, and sets them on a tray. We follow
the tray, but see only the right arm and aproned midsection of the waiter
carrying it. He carries the tray along the counter toward a pair of
swinging doors that lead out into the restaurant.

The doors swing in as another WAITER sweeps into the kitchen, and our
waiter heads out into the dining area. As the doors swing closed behind
him, they reveal storage shelves crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed
tomatoes --

-- and a DEAD WAITER, literally folded in half and stuffed in among the
shelves.

<b>INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY
</b>
ROSENBERG and the ARQUILLIAN raise their glasses in a toast.

<b>ttttARQUILLIAN
</b>ttTo the continued reign of the Arquillian
ttEmpire.

<b>ttttROSENBERG
</b>ttTo the safety of the galaxy.

They CLINK glasses and drink, just as the Waiter arrives. Still, we see
only his arms and midsection as he sets the tray on a stand and lifts the
plates of pirogi. He carries them to the table and sets them down.

Rosenberg, setting his glass down next to the plate, catches a glimpse of
the Waiter's hand --

-- just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiter's sleeve
and scurries across the table. The glass slips out of Rosenberg's hand,
dumping wine all over the table.

He looks up, slowly, and sees the Waiter's face.

It's EDGAR. Another half dozen insects of all variety tumble out of
Edgar's sleeves and scurry across the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian
freeze, paralyzed with fear. They seem to know what dire implications
Edgar's presence holds.

<b>ttttROSENBERG
</b>ttt(in English again)
ttYou can kill us both -- but you will not
ttfind it.

Edgar smiles.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttYou're right about one thing.

Suddenly a long STINGER whips out from under the back of Edgar's apron and
zips under the table. First Rosenberg and then the Arquillian lurch
forward their chairs, their faces contorting in pain.

They both pitch forward, their faces slogging into fresh pirogi.

The stinger SNAPS out from under the table and whips back under Edgar's
apron. He moves quickly, searching their pockets, but he doesn't find what
he's looking for. The cat, still perched on top of the ornate box, HISSES
at him.

Edgar reaches out and BATS the cat away with one vicious swipe of his
hand. The animal HOWLS and flies across the room, landing in a WOMAN's
lunch.

The Woman SCREAMS. Now other DINERS' attention is drawn to Edgar's table,
where two obviously dead men are being robbed by a waiter. There are
SHOUTS of outrage, a few MEN rise out of their seats.

Edgar grabs the ornate box and tries to open it, but finds it locked. With
the furor rising around him, he shoves the box under one arm and bolts for
the door.

Rosenberg's cat leaps back onto the table and SNARLS at him as he goes.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

Later, and the Russian diner is now a crime scene, clustered with COPS and
flashing lights. THREE BODIES, now on stretchers and covered with sheets,
are being loaded into the back of ambulances.

ROSENBERG'S CAT races out of a UNIFORMED COP's arms and leaps onto one of
the stretchers, MEOWING mournfully. The Uniformed Cop turns to a POLICE
INSPECTOR who is questioning the WOMAN from the diner.

<b>ttttCOP
</b>ttWhat am I supposed to do with the cat?

<b>ttttINSPECTOR
</b>ttI don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let
ttfamily claim it.

The Cop nods and follows the stretcher with Rosenberg's body into the back
of one of the ambulances, allowing the cat to ride on the chest of its
dead owner for the time being.

The doors of the wagon SLAM shut.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

<b>INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

The stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police
headquarters. ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the
stretcher approaches two doors with "City Morgue" written across them. The
words split in half as the stretcher BANGS through the doors.

<b>INT. MORGUE - DAY
</b>
The city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses
parked left and right. Busy day in the Apple. The Cop wheeling the
stretcher calls out to the CORONER, who's hunched over another body.

<b>ttttCOP
</b>ttWhere do you want contestant number three?

The coroner turns around. It's DR. LAUREL WEAVER, the woman who tried to
speak to Jay before. She sighs and waves a hand.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttBy the wall, I guess.
ttt(noticing)
ttWhat's with the cat?

<b>ttttCOP
</b>ttOh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat.
ttSign here.

Laurel signs his clipboard.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttWhat's the problem with the cat?

<b>ttttCOP
</b>ttYour problem.

Laurel gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. She goes over to
the stretcher and bends down, petting Rosenberg's cat gently.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttAre you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up.
ttt(of Rosenberg)
ttHis is worse.

She sets the cat aside and wheels the stretcher under the lights.

<b>ttttLAUREL (CONT'D)
</b>ttOkey-dokey. Shall we?

<b>INT. MORGUE - LATER - DAY
</b>
Laurel is hunched over the corpse, the only light in the room coming from
the overhead spot that illuminates her work.

Fascinated by something, she digs deeper. And deeper. And looks up, her
face a mixture of alarm and excitement.

Two men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside
the morgue. They hasten down the hallway, their shoes CLICKING in perfect
lockstep, headed for those swinging doors at the other end.

JAY and KAY. Men in Black on a mission.

<b>INT. MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>
In the morgue, LAUREL has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms.
ROSENBERG'S CAT sits on the desk next to her, licking its paws. Suddenly,
the cat looks up, MEOWING urgently.

Laurel looks up and, following the cat's gaze, turns around slowly in her
chair. JAY and KAY stand in the doorway, staring at her. Kay steps
forward, holding out that black card again. It reforms into another kind
of official ID, this time it says "DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH"

She looks up. Jay and Kay are standing there.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttYeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm
ttgoing to need to see some ID.

He hands her his CARTE NOIR, which changes to read "Dr. Menville,
Department of Public Health." She hands it back.

<b>ttttLAUREL

ttYou boys must not have much of a home life.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWe watch the morgues very carefully. You've

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttI'd say so -- triple homicide.

She gets up and goes to the Arquillian's body, which is still out on a
table under the lights.

<b>ttttLAUREL (CONT'D)
</b>ttThe first corpse was perfectly normal,
ttexcept that he was broken in half, but when
ttI opened up the other two -- well, look.

She throws back a sheet, revealing (to them only, not us) the fully
dissected Arquillian. Kay raises an eyebrow; Jay nearly retches.

<b>ttttLAUREL (CONT'D)
</b>ttThere's a skeletal structure at work here
ttunlike anything I've ever seen.

Kay steps past her, going straight to the body. He begins to examine it.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI'll have a look at this one. Dr. White,
ttwhy don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the
ttother body?

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttThis way, Doctor.

Jay and Laurel cross the room, to where ROSENBERG's corpse lies out on
another gurney.

<b>ttttLAUREL (CONT'D)
</b>ttThis one's even stranger. I did a full
ttlaparotomy. I started with the lesser

ttjunction.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttI think, uh, we should start at the same

Jay hears a MEOW and looks down. Rosenberg's cat is rubbing up against his
leg.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYour cat?

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttGuess it is now. Came in with the bodies.

She SNAPS one of her rubber gloves and reaches down (out of frame),
sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside. Just by the
look on Jay's face, one can imagine how disgusting it is.

Laurel digs in, up to her elbows. Jay winces. She pulls one bloody glove
out, to wipe a strand of hair out of her face. He looks at her --

-- and she winks at him. He's surprised. She laughs.

<b>ttttLAUREL (CONT'D)
</b>ttOkay. Dive right in. God knows he won't

Jay is reluctant, so she rolls her eyes and helps him, taking him by the
hand and guiding him into the thick of the corpse.

<b>ttttLAUREL (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou have very pretty eyes.

ttWell, of course they are. What I'm pointing

</b>ttHave we met before? I have the strangest
ttfeeling of deja vu.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou know, I was just going to ask you the

Laurel looks at him sideways, skeptical, but also intrigued. She whispers
to him. Confiding in him.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttOkay. You wanna know what I really think?
ttt(re: Kay)
ttBut don't tell that guy. He looks like he's

ttt(then)
ttThis body is not really a body, but it's

Jay just looks at her intrigued.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttBy the way, stop me if I'm freaking you out.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttNo, no...not at all.

After a particularly gross GUSHY sound, he looks away, toward her. She's
staring at him.

Laurel leans over and lowers her voice, just for him.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttYou know what I like to do sometimes? When

From the other side of the room, Kay CLEARS HIS THROAT.

<b>ttttJAY (CONT'D)

He walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian.
But Jay never takes his eyes off Laurel.

ACROSS THE MORGUE, Laurel is still examining Rosenberg, now bent down next
to his head, carefully studying his left ear. She notices something
strange, turns, and calls over her shoulder to Jay.

Jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttLook at this.

Jay leans down. There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's
ear.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWhat is that?

He reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. With a soft
<b>CLICK --
</b>
-- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch.

Jay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and
Rosenberg's entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES
OPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial
skull.

<b>A TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG'S HEAD.

Though not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded. He
staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with
gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull.

But an inhuman GROWL rattles the whole van and they wise up, hurrying on
their way.

Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its
various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his
way into it. Crammed into the back of the van along with his spaceship,
Edgar wedges a screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the
rest of the box and SMACKS it with his right fist. Nothing doing.

He BELLOWS in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it
finally CRACKS a hinge. Edgar snaps it up, pries the rest of the hinge off
with the screwdriver, and wrenches the top off the box.

Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he
promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttNo. No, NO, NO, NOOOO!

He rips the box apart with his bare hands. There's nothing else there.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. MIB BUILDING - MAGIC HOUR
</b>
As lower Manhattan is waking up, Jay and Kay enter the building.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Despite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast. The large
screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the CONSTELLATION
<b>ORION.
</b>
Jay and Kay hurry in -- Kay peels off to one of the monitors; Jay heads
for Zed.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttDoesn't anybody believe in sleep around
tthere?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttThe twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time
tt-- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months --
ttyou'll get used to it. Or you'll have a
ttpsychotic episode.

He points up at the screen with a laser pencil.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttHere's Orion; the brightest grouping of
ttstars in the northern sky...
ttt(pointing)
ttand here's Orion's belt --

He indicates the three stars that make up the belt.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttThat's what the little guy was talking
ttabout, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on
ttOrion's belt..."

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttThere are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The
ttbelt is just these three stars; galaxies
ttare huge, made up of billions of stars.
ttt(switches off the laser
tttpointer)
ttYou heard wrong.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou're attracted to me, aren't you?

Jay starts to cross over to ANOTHER MONITOR, where Kay is sitting alone,
tie loosened, slightly disheveled. On the screen, the word "SEARCHING"
blinks, encouraging patience. The image changes to a satellite view of
North America, which quickly zooms in on the Southwest.

On screen, the satellite view zooms down to Arizona, then a city, then a
neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. The printout changes to
<b>"SUBJECT ACQUIRED."
</b>
The image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we
get a good look at a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.
<b>tttSUBJECT: ELIZABETH ANN RESTON
</b><b>ttt PRESENT LOCATION: RESIDENCE
</b><b>ttt 553 FAIRFIELD AVE./TEMPE/AZ
</b>Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely. She's setting a picnic
table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by
an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind
him.

Jay notices the monitor with the Middle-aged Woman on it. He looks at
Kay's expression, then back at the monitor.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttPretty lady...

Kay clicks off the picture of her. Jay drags a chair and sits down.

<b>ttttJAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou were the guy with the flowers in the
ttphoto, (the night the aliens arrived.)
tt(What, you were on your way to a dance or
ttsomething and you got lost? And she never
ttgot those flowers, did she?]

Kay doesn't answer, just stares at the screen. Elizabeth looks up, as if
she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky,
wondering how many stars'll be out tonight.

<b>ttttJAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttGrumpy Guy's story comes into focus. She
ttever get married?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNo.

It's more than Kay can bear. He reaches out and flicks a switch. The
monitor goes blank, except for a data screen:
<b>ttt    SUBJECT LOST
</b>Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. Jay looks at
him: "Is this me in thirty years?" A moment goes by. Finally:

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWell, it's better to have loved and lost
ttthan never to have --

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttTry it.

<b>ttttZED (O.S.)
</b>ttKay.

Jay and Kay cross back toward the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each
of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a
flickering LIGHT.

Some lights are starting to go out.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(quietly, with dread)
ttThey're leaving.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttWe've had twelve jumps in the last hour.
ttRedgick was just the beginning.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWhat do they know that we don't know?

Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Another light flickers out.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhy do rats desert the ship?
ttt(to the twins)
ttGo to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view
ttof Manhattan.

ON THE SCREEN New York City is just a bright spot of light on the Eastern
coast of the United States.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttFour hundred.

Now there's a view of the earth from space. Nothing unusual.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttFour thousand.

Now we're looking at earth from far, far away -- and from here we can see
something that doesn't belong in this picture:

A BATTLE CRUISER far off to one side of the earth. The words "LEVEL FOUR"
flash in red letters on one side of the map.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttThat's an Arquillian battle cruiser.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttAnd we've got a dead Arquillian prince.

A COMMUNICATION STARTS COMING OVER THE SPEAKERS -- a sound like a cat and
mouse caught in a blender.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMessage coming in.

The communication continues.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttSpeak of the devil.

The communication continues.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttThey sound pissed.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttt(to the twins)
ttTranslate that and step on it!
ttt(to Kay)
ttMeanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and
ttsee what you can turn up.

Kay and Jay walk away.

<b>ttttZED (CONT'D)
</b>ttAnd Kay -- take a lot of fire power.

IN THE EQUIPMENT LOCKER Kay pulls out the ENORMOUS, MANY-BARRELED HAND
GUN. A small, clear, canister sprouts from underneath it, malicious
swirling gases visible through its walls.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttI like that.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttSeries four de-atomizer.

Kay pulls out another weapon, the TINIEST GUN WE'VE EVER SEEN.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttHere. We call this the "Noisy Cricket."

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou get a series four de-atomizer and I get
tta "Noisy Cricket?!"
ttt(looks at the gun)
ttI'm afraid I'm going to break it.

Jay follows Kay out, glancing back to see the huge gun turrets on the
Arquillian Battle Cruiser HUM and WHIR as they swing around into position,
pointed down at the unwitting planet below.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY
</b>
SMASH! The window in the front door of Rosenberg's jewelry shop collapses
in a shower of glass. EDGAR reaches in and fumbles with the locks, undoing
them one by one. He gets them all and steps inside. Out the window behind
him, we can see his Orkin van, double parked in the street in front.

All the gems and jewels are under glass counters. Edgar starts SMASHING
the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside.

Outside, a New York City tow truck pulls up to the front of the Orkin van
and starts to hitch up.

Edgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed
pictures on the walls. He stops at one particular picture, staring
intently at it. It's a glamor shot of Rosenberg's cat, provocatively posed
on a satin pillow. There are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some
posed with Rosenberg, some by itself. This animal was important to
Rosenberg.

From outside, the ROAR of an engine distracts Edgar. He turns around, in
time to see the Orkin van lurch as the tow lifts its front wheels off the
ground.

<b>EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY
</b>
EDGAR rushes outside as the tow truck DRIVER gets the van up on the hoist.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttThat's my truck!

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttAnd make sure you tell them that at the
ttimpound.

Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve
gauge. He points it at the tow truck Driver. The tow truck driver looks at
him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun.

<b>ttttDRIVER (CONT'D)
</b>ttI got worse.

He keeps hitching up the van. Two pedestrians walk past the dispute, very
fast, ignoring the debate, headed right for the shop. We go with them, and
realize that it's --

-- JAY and KAY. They stop at the smashed door of the jewelry shop and
exchange a glance. Kay pulls a very menacing-looking weapon, nods, and
they step inside.

<b>INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY
</b>
They look around and see the recent demolition caused by Edgar. Jay
furrows his brow.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWho robs a jewelry store and leaves the
ttjewels?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttSomeone who's not looking for jewels.

Jay moves behind the counter. On the floor is an ornate, empty bowl and a
bag of cat food, next to a scrumptious pillow. There are several PHOTOS OF
A CAT on the wall.

There is also a pile of BEJEWELED CAT COLLARS. Jay picks up one of the
COLLARS, inspects it closely, shaking his head.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttThis guy had a serious crush on his cat.

Jay's attention is broken by something through the window. Outside,
lumbering straight for the store, is EDGAR.

Jay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face?

Suddenly, Edgar raises his arms, pointing both the farmer's rifle and the
driver's shotgun. Before Edgar can shoot, Jay YELLS...

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttKay! GET DOWN!

And then Jay FIRES, shattering the storefront window, and BLOWING UP A CAR
on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, SLAMMING
him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down
the street as Jay picks himself up.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttThe bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck
ttfrom the picture! That's him!

Jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(picking himself up)
ttDamn it.

Kay runs out after Jay.

<b>EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY
</b>
Edgar doesn't bother sticking around to continue his fight. He jumps
behind the wheel of the tow truck, starts it up, and hits the gas. The
engine ROARS.

Jay sprints after him, FIRING his noisy cricket. He is thrown back into
some pedestrians, while his SHOT...

Hits the rigging between the Orkin Van and the town truck, separating the
two. Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it
accelerates too quickly.

Edgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked CAR to
try and get some height. As Jay prepares to shoot, EDGAR DISAPPEARS AROUND
THE CORNER, and a HUGH TRUCK backs into his line of fire.

JAY FIRES, the TRUCK EXPLODES and Jay flies BACKWARDS, hurtling through
the air and CRASHING through the window of a car, his rear end right in
the woman driver's face.

When Jay looks up, Kay is standing before him. He yanks Jay out of the
car.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWe do not discharge our weapons in view of
ttthe public.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttCan we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's
ttan Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up
ttthe world if we don't...

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThere's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or
tta Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic
ttplague about to wipe out life on this
ttplanet, and the only thing that lets people
ttget on with their hopeful little lives is
ttthat they don't know about it.

Kay gestures to a group of ONLOOKERS, drawn by the curious blasts from the
store. There's smoking rubble everywhere.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttDon't worry about the bug. He's not leaving
tttown. We've got his ship.

After gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is
neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttZed, we're gonna need a containment crew
ttdown here at McDougal, south of Houston.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY
</b>
Back at Men in Black Headquarters, the little lights on the world map
which indicate aliens' locations are going out, one by one, about one
every five or ten seconds. A WARNING BUZZER is sounding, over and over,
and HUMAN STAFFERS are rushing left and right.

ZED is in his office.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttContainment may be a moot point, my friend.
ttThe exodus continues. It's like the party's
ttover and the last one to leave gets stuck
ttwith the check.

Zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with
suitcases walking across the floor.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttYou sorry little ingrates!

<b>ttttKAY (O.S.)
</b>ttWhat about the Arquillians?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttWe've only translated a part of the message
ttso far: "Deliver the Galaxy."

<b>ttttKAY (O.S.)
</b>ttNo, they don't want much, do they?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttOh, it gets better... They're holding us
ttresponsible.

He looks up at the screen. It reads:
<b>tttt   MIB
</b><b>ttt   DELIVER THE GALAXY.
</b>
<b>ttttZED
</b>ttAnother contestant has entered the ring.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK STREET (OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE)
</b>
As Kay puts away his phone, turns to Jay

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAll right, kid. The Arquillians want the
ttgalaxy, whatever the hell that means. We
ttneed help. A professional. Someone with
ttyears of experience in intergalactic
ttpolitics. I just hope the little prick
tthasn't skipped town.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. UPTOWN NEWSSTAND - DAY
</b>
The tow truck SQUEALS to a halt at a curb.  EDGAR gets out and walks away,
fast, CURSING under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he
passes a newsstand, he grabs the NEWS VENDOR by the collar.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttWhere do you keep your dead?

<b>ttttVENDOR
</b>ttt(thinks)
ttI don't have any dead.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttWhere?!

<b>ttttVENDOR
</b>ttI don't know, the city morgue!

Edgar shoves him away roughly. But before he leaves, his eye catches a
postcard display marked "LANDMARKS OF THE NEW YORK CITY AREA." Edgar
stares, fascinated, but we don't see what he's looking at. He reaches out
and picks up a color postcard.

He raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and
hurries off.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. STREET - KEY KIOSK - DAY
</b>
Kay's LTD SCREECHES to a halt in front of the kiosk on Orchard Street. JAY
and KAY leap out and Jay spots the VENDOR, closing up the shop. He's
wearing a dirty cardigan, watch cap, and fingerless gloves, his face
aquiver with ticks and mannerisms. He has a small dog in front of him.

Jay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttOf course that guy's an alien. That's gotta
ttbe the worst disguise I've ever seen.

A voice answers him, but not the Vendor's.

<b>ttttFRANK THE PUG
</b>ttYou don't like it, you can kiss my furry

Jay looks down. The voice is coming from the dog. This is FRANK THE PUG.
Kay approaches, motioning to Jay to make sure no one hears.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou busy, Frank?

<b>ttttFRANK THE PUG
</b>ttSorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my

Kay grabs Frank. He yelps like, well, a dog.

</b>ttCall the pound. We got a stray.

<b>ttttFRANK THE PUG
</b>ttHey! Get your paws off me!

PASSERBYS glare at Kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor

</b>ttThe, uh...dog owes my friend some money.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(to Frank)
ttArquillians and bugs. What do you know?

<b>ttttFRANK THE PUG
</b>ttI know nothing.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNot a thing?

Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to force an answer.

<b>ttttFRANK THE PUG
</b>ttStop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn't some
tttwo-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of
tta galaxy. They thought he would be safe
tthere on earth.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAnd the bug had other plans.

<b>ttttFRANK THE PUG
</b>ttThe galaxy is the best source for subatomic

ttRosenberg said something about a galaxy on

ttThey're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

</b>ttThe galaxy is here.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHere?

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttThe galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars

If a dog can smirk, Frank does.

<b>ttttFRANK THE PUG
</b>ttYou humans, when're you gonna learn that

</b>ttTiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel.
ttNow if you'll excuse me, I need to be walked

Kay lets go of Frank, turns to Jay, who is lost in thought.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(to Frank the Pug)
ttGet out of here.

In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT
leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the
middle of the file she's studying.

Laurel jumps.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttBoy, when you want attention --

She pets the cat. As she does, the cat's collar shines in the light.
Laurel turns the name tag to face her.

<b>CLOSE ON A PRECIOUS JEWEL, AND THE WORD "ORION."
</b>
As it is written across the collar of the cat.

<b>ttttLAUREL (O.S)
</b>tt"Orion." That's a pretty name.

From out in the corridor, a bell rings -- DING, DING.

Laurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a CIRCULAR ICON
of a strange and beautiful metal. The center is some sort of hardened,
translucent material, light green in color.

<b>ttttLAUREL (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhat's this?

She peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement.

<b>INT. ICON - DAY

It's as if Laurel is sucked into another universe. Her face goes
beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield, millions of
stars, billions of green, verdant planets, all racing by her at the speed
of light.

<b>INT. MORGUE - DAY
</b>
<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttWow.

Outside, the bell DINGS again. Orion looks up, as if knowing who's out
there, and not liking it. She SNARLS at the door and leaps off the desk,
scurrying across the lab and disappearing under some equipment.

<b>INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

On a counter in the morgue corridor, a gray, peeling hand BANGS on a bell
on a countertop, over and over. The hand belongs to EDGAR, who is carrying
his shotgun, concealing it behind one leg. The morgue attendant, TONY,
emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of Atlas
Shrugged and a fly swatter.

<b>ttttTONY
</b>ttThank you for making sure the bell works.

Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a

<b>ttttTONY
</b>ttI'll need a picture ID, written proof of

</b>ttDon't -- do that.

WHACK! Still another fly goes down.

<b>ttttTONY
</b>ttDo what?

Tony looks down, to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter. Half a dozen
cockroaches stream out of his sleeve.

</b>ttShit!

He ducks under the counter --

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttI told you, I don't know, it ran under some

He grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue, toward the equipment
she pointed to. As they draw close, ORION the cat bolts from underneath
it, races between their legs, and leapfrogs over several small cabinets,
landing on top of a very tall one with only six inches clearance between
it and the ceiling. A very tough hiding place.

Edgar just starts to turn when they hear the BELL and a VOICE from the
corridor outside.

<b>ttttJAY (O.S.)
</b>ttHello? Anybody here?

Edgar looks up at the cat's hiding place. No time to get it. The bell

Roughly, Edgar pulls Laurel close and puts a finger to his lips --
"Shhhhhhh."

<b>INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
KAY comes down the stairs and into the morgue corridor.  He checks his
watch, then leans against the counter and pulls out a pack of cigarettes.
Waiting.

<b>INT. MORGUE - DAY
</b>
Jay is thoroughly enjoying himself, but Laurel seems to be going crazy.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttI have something I need to show you.

She looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttNow slow down, you don't have to hit the
ttgas like that.

She leans in and lowers her voice.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttYou don't understand. You really need to
ttsee this.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttAnd I will. But we gotta get something
ttstraight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not
ttsome kind of macho trip, it's just the way
ttI'm used to doing things, okay?

<b>INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it
to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a sharp
<b>SIZZLE.
</b>
Kay furrows his brow. Odd.

<b>INT. MORGUE - DAY
</b>
Laurel is at the end of her rope.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttLook, Stud, I don't know how many more
tttimes I'm going to get to tell you this.
ttThere's something --

She points, sharply, at the examination table directly in front of her.

<b>ttttLAUREL (CONT'D)
</b>tt-- that you have to help me with.

Jay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out.  He starts to
reach for his gun.

<b>INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
Kay raises another lit match to his cigarette, but as this one gets close,
a BIG GLOB OF GOO drops from the ceiling and onto the match, dousing the
flame.

Kay looks up, sharply.

Above him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the
ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen
look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.

From inside the morgue, Laurel SCREAMS.

<b>INT. MORGUE - DAY
</b>
Kay races into the morgue just as the examination table EXPLODES into the
air, revealing EDGAR, who was hiding beneath it.

Now everything happens at once. Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy
Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his
shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttFreeze it, Bug!

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttDon't shoot! Don't shoot!

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttt(to Jay)
ttCHRIST, are you THICK!

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttHow was I supposed to know!?!

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttWhat did I have to do, SING it for you!?!

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttMaybe if you didn't come on like a drunken
ttprom date!

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttOh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman
ttshows the slightest hint of sexual
ttindependence, men just --

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttEverybody shut UP!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttLet her go, Shit Eater.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttListen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that
ttkind of talk in my end of the universe, but
ttcompared to you humans, I'm the top rung on
ttthe evolutionary ladder, so can it, all
ttright?!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou're breakin' my heart. Move six inches
ttto your left and I'll solve all your
ttproblems.

ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and
landing on Edgar, HISSING and scratching and clawing for all she's worth.
Edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off. The cat squirms in his arm, the
icon jangling. Edgar grabs the icon, holds onto it, and flings the cat
away, across the morgue. The icon comes free, remaining in his hand.

He drops it into his mouth and swallows. He shoves the gun hard against
Laurel's cheek.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttThat's better. Now put down your weapons.
ttWe're leaving.

Kay freezes, teeth clenched, gun still in front of him. Standoff.

<b>ttttEDGAR (CONT'D)
</b>ttHave you ever pulled the wings off a fly?

Edgar cranks one of Laurel's arms behind her back, hard, and she CRIES OUT
in pain.

<b>ttttEDGAR (CONT'D)
</b>ttWould you care to see the fly get even?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHow far you think you'll get without your
ttship? If that's what you call that hunk of
ttspace crap we've got back at our office.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttPut the weapons down!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNever gonna happen, Insect.

Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass
window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance,
slowly, cornering him.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttIt's okay, Laurel!

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttHOW is it okay?!

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttI mean it's going to be okay!

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttDon't bet on it, meat sack.

And with that he turns, leaps --

-- and CRASHES right through the window, into the air shaft.

<b>EXT. MORGUE (SIDE STREET) - DUSK
</b>
EDGAR, still clutching LAUREL, EXPLODES up over a railing.

Nobody looks twice as Edgar, dragging Laurel (with his arm over her
mouth), races toward the nearby busy Manhattan Street.

<b>INT. MORGUE - AIR SHAFT - DUSK
</b>
Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and
the walls are smooth anyway.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttDamn it!

They turn and run out of the morgue.

<b>EXT. THE NEARBY BUSY MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK
</b>
EDGAR, with LAUREL, RUNS right in front of a CAB, which screeches to a
halt inches from them. The CABBIE sticks his head out and YELLS something
in an unknown language. And KEEPS yelling as --

Edgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the Cabbie out the door
(cigarette and wooden seat-beads and all).

The Cab Driver is still yelling as Edgar leaps in, pushing Laurel in
before him, leaving her behind the wheel.

He removes a POSTCARD -- the one he took from the display on the
newsstand.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttTake me here.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttWhat???

Edgar just cranks the car into gear -- opening his mouth and swallowing
the icon -- and in so doing revealing a TRIPLE ROW OF SERRATED BUG-TEETH,
he SLAMS HIS FOOT on the gas pedal.

Laurel's head snaps back as the car rocks forward. She has no choice, but
to grab the wheel and start steering as --

The car screeches out into traffic, swerving wildly as Laurel is forced to
make a 90-degree turn. The car fishtails wildly, swiping an oncoming car
as it straightens and heads into the traffic.

The furious Cab Driver runs off after it, still yelling as he disappears
around the corner.

A second later, KAY and JAY rush out into the street. The cab is nowhere
to be seen. Jay runs into the street, noticing the wooden beads, the
ripped pine-scented green deodorizer, and the still-burning cigarette.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttThey're in a cab.

And Jay starts running down the street, where DOZENS of cabs are waiting
at the intersection.  He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows,
scaring the living shit out of people --

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttHey! Laurel!? Hey!

-- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found. Up ahead the light turns
green and the tide of taxis wash away, leaving Jay on the street. He turns
as a car screeches up behind him, its headlights shining in his eyes. As
it gets closer, Jay sees it's Kay in the LTD.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttStop wasting time. He's not getting off the
ttplanet in a cab.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head
toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in
frenetic activity in response to the threat from above.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(to tech at a desk)
ttCome with me. Put up a bio-net all the way
ttaround Manhattan; if it's not human, it's
ttnot leaving the island.

</b>ttWhat've we got from our friends upstairs?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttSame thing: "Deliver the galaxy."

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but
ttwe've got his ship. He's got to be looking
ttfor a way out.

Just then, a loud ALARM wails.

AT THE MAIN VIEWING SCREEN, A GREEN LINE shoots out from the Arquillian
ship, striking a region of planet earth.

<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
-- headquarters, where every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going
off.

<b>ttttJAY
</b><b>ttWHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?!
</b>
<b>ttttZED
</b>ttArquillian battle rules, kid. First we get
ttan ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we
tthave a galactic standard week to respond.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttA galactic standard week? How the hell long
ttis that?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttOne hour.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttOne hour?

Viewing the screen, it now reads:
<b>tttt    MIB

</b>
<b>ttttZED
</b>ttTo keep the bugs from getting it, the

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou're talking about US!

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttSucks, doesn't it?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttPull up the locations of all land-based
ttinterstellar vehicles.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttThey're all gone. Frank the Pug took the
ttlast ship on the planet.

As Kay and Zed watch as the machine scrolls through the data, Jay walks
back towards the center of the room, deep in thought. Over him we hear:

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAtlantic City?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttGone.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThat landfill on the Jersey Shore?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttGone.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttUh, gentlemen.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttEpcot?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttGone.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMiami Beach?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttGone.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttFellas.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHartford?

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttGone, thank God.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttHey. Old guys.

Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling.

<b>ttttJAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttDo those still work?

They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall
in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the
enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the
mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped
by --

-- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand
there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we --

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</b>
-- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing
Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards
away. EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver's door and follows behind
her, still holding his weapon on her.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttYou're coming with me.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttWhat?! Why?!

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttIt's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

And he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships.

Behind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the
front of the postcard he's been carrying around. "FLUSHING MEADOWS, SITE
OF THE 1964 WORLD'S FAIR," it says, with a distinctive photograph of the
spaceships.

So that's how he knew.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

Nighttime now, and the city hums along, just another Thursday night.  The

<b>EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT
</b>
TVs in the window of an appliance store show a rerun of "Cheers." PEOPLE

<b>EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT
</b>
The news ticker in Times Square announces the latest shattering news:

doom.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
KAY and JAY leap into Kay's LTD and SLAM the doors. Kay jams the key in
the ignition, the car ROARS to life, and he turns to Jay.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhaddya say we bag us some bug?

He hits the gas and the car ROCKETS away from the curb.

<b>EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
The LTD tears through the city.

<b>INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT
</b>
Kay turns sharply to the right, SMACKING Jay around. Looking up ahead, he
sees the entrance to the midtown tunnel.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou're taking the tunnel?!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou know a better way to Queens?

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttIt's usually jammed?!

<b>EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT
</b>
The LTD races through the tunnel at top speed. It's clear driving for a
few seconds, but then they round a bend --

-- and there's a traffic jam up ahead.

<b>INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT
</b>
Kay approaches the line of cars at top speed, with no intention of slowing
down. Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttI told you!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttJay. The button?

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYeah?!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttPush the button, Jay.

A LIGHTED PANEL rotates into place between the two front seats, and that
red button flashes underneath its plastic shield again. Jay flips back the
plastic cover and JAMS his finger down on the red flashing button.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttAnd you may want to throw on a seat belt.

<b>EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - MIB LTD - NIGHT
</b>
As the LTD rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve,
its shape actually changing. The sides and back extend as some sort of
endoskeleton pushes the "normal" panels out. It becomes a larger, wirier
machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and
metallic tendons.

Kay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last
possible moment it swerves off to the side, a SUCKING SOUND coming from
underneath it.

Instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to
it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic
below.

It keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels
clinging to the roof of the tunnel.

<b>INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT
</b>
Jay falls from his seat with a CLUNK, onto the upside down ceiling of the
car. Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they
tear through the tunnel, ZOOMING over the bottlenecked traffic underneath.

As they race through the tunnel, they have a minute to kill.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMind if I smoke?

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWhat?!?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttIn the car, I mean.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttI don't care!!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHey, just a common courtesy. It bothers
ttsome people if you smoke in a car.

He lights a cigarette and blows the smoke out leisurely, one hand on the
wheel, just waiting out the tunnel. Jay gives up struggling to right
himself and closes his eyes, suffering through this.

<b>EXT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT
</b>
From outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel.
We can hear KAY'S VOICE as he goes on. And on.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYeah, it's harder and harder to smoke
ttanywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I
ttshould quit. I've tried. Never took,
ttthough. I'm beginning to think I lack
ttself-control.

And they disappear out the other end of the tunnel --

<b>INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT
</b>
-- and flip over, BANGING back down onto the road on the other side. Jay
falls off the ceiling and SLAMS into his seat.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWell, back to work.

He flips his cigarette out the window and cranks the wheel to the left.

<b>EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - TOLL BOOTH - NIGHT
</b>
Approaching a toll booth, the LTD shoots across nine lanes of traffic and
through the only open booth, SHATTERING the gate. Traveling at about two
hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window --

-- and it CHINKS in the basket as their taillights disappear.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - LANDING TOWER - NIGHT
</b>
EDGAR climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships,
pushing LAUREL up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttCome on, let me go, you don't want to eat
ttme. I'm a very important person on my
ttplanet. Like a queen. A goddess, even.
ttThere are those who worship me, yes. I'm
ttnot trying to impress you with this, I'm
ttjust letting you know. It could start a
ttwar.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttGood. War means food for my family, all
ttseventy-eight million of them. That's a lot
ttof mouths to feed, your highness.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttYou're a wonderful dad.

And with that she KICKS him squarely in the face. He reels, momentarily
losing his grip on her. She takes advantage of the moment and FLINGS
HERSELF out, into the air.

Edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. She falls, tumbling through the
air --

-- and lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches
rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the
ground.

Above, Edgar just keeps climbing.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</b>
Over at the fence, the LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the
fairgrounds.

AT THE TRUNK, JAY and KAY flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever
weapons look most dangerous. Kay grabs a black box, UNSNAPS a row of
latches, and opens it, revealing --

-- the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet.

Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump
action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. The
shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. Kay loads up
the clip.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou know how to work that?

Kay pumps it once, with extreme confidence.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNo idea whatsoever.

He SLAMS the trunk, revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their
columns in the distance.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttLet's bag us some bug.

As if on cue, one of the saucers begins to HUM. Then it starts to spin,
faster and faster. The ship begins to rise.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttOh, shit.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - TREE - NIGHT
</b>
Laurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement.

<b>EXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT
</b>
At Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress. Behind the home plate side,
the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible.

But at that very moment, the batter CRACKS into a fastball, hard. The
crowd rises to its feet, SHOUTING, staring out at center field, where the
ball is headed.

All eyes in the house are on the Mets' CENTER FIELDER, except for his
eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen,
his jaw drops --

-- and the catchable ball sails over his head, THUDDING into the wall
behind him. The crowd BOOS viciously.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</b>
Kay raises the weapon he took from the trunk; looks over at Jay.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttSet it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic
ttimplosion factor --

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttPress the little green button, on three.

Jay raises his weapon; they press their green buttons.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttOne...two...

They pull their triggers.

For a moment, nothing happens, as if it were a misfire. But then, there is
a VACUUM WHUMP, like all the air in the immediate area being sucked into a
space the size of a dime, and a tremendous shock wave rolls out from the
barrel of the guns.

Jay and Kay are sucked to the ground by the bizarre force, THUDDING to
their stomachs like magnets to a refrigerator.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</b>
The shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship,
then it HITS the ship --

-- and it too is sucked back down. Hurtling back toward them.

<b>EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT
</b>
She flinches as the flying saucer shoots overhead.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</b>
The saucer CRASHES through the Unisphere, an enormous steel globe, and
THUDS to the earth, CRASHING through brush, dirt and rock...

Jay and Kay come to their feet...

In front of them, the dust clears... Trees uprooted, stones and dirt
thrown everywhere...a dumpster has been cast to their left...

And the saucer is there, embedded in the earth, tipped off-kilter in a
mound of debris...

A hatch comes up...revealing Edgar, walking slowly toward them, with
contained fury.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttYou don't get it. I've won. It's over.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou are under arrest for violating number
tt4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand
ttover any galaxy you might be carrying.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttYou milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a
ttfew seconds you won't even be matter!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMove away from the vehicle and put your
tthands on your head.

He pumps the gun for emphasis.

<b>ttttEDGAR
</b>ttPut my hands on my head?

Edgar stares at him. Then flexes his arms, still encased in flesh. His
giant pincers RIP free of the rotting skin.

He extends both pincers to the sides, and, my God, his reach must be
twelve feet across.

Now the skin and clothes on Edgar's legs begins to CRACK and SHRED. They
BURST APART, revealing two hideous, doubled-over insect legs. The bug
raises himself aloft on his legs.

He sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the Edgar suit goes
the way of the arms and legs. The torso EXPLODES in great rendering of
cloth and skin, and finally

Edgar's head simply BURSTS apart, SPATTERING against the walls. Edgar now
reveals himself as he really is: a hairy, bug-like exoskeleton, a scaly
tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a
small nose, and two horse-like feet with three toes each.

He raises his pincers in the air, resting them on his head. The GALAXY
hangs on a chain around his neck.

<b>ttttBUG
</b>ttLike this?

Kay and Jay pump their guns and aim at the Bug.

Suddenly the Bug SPITS. And a HUGE, SLIMY WAD OF GOO shoots from him and
engulfs both shotguns. The Bug snorts it back, tearing them from Jay and
Kay's grasp, then swallowing them.

Jay and Kay have only a second to react before --

The Bug SWIPES at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone
brushing aside a gnat -- and SENDS THEM FLYING FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR.

<b>EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT
</b>
She flinches as she sees them hit the ground. She starts to climb the
tree.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</b>
Jay and Kay hit the ground with loud grunts.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttThat did not go at all like I had planned.

They look up to see the Bug moving for the second tower -- and the second
flying saucer. Kay gets to his feet.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThis guy's really starting to bug me.

Kay starts walking after the Bug.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on
ttthat ship.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWhere are you going?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttGetting my gun back.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWhat!?

Kay steps forward and yells at the departing Bug.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttHey, Bug!

The Bug just keeps moving toward the ladder.

<b>ttttKAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttI'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many
ttof your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

The Bug turns toward Kay. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off
against the giant alien hug.

<b>EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT
</b>
She quietly makes it to the ground -- hurries off to the darkness of the
woods.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON KAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT
</b>
Kay has himself in the Bug's face, its dripping fangs inches from Kay's
face.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou're just a smear on the sports page to
ttme, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal
ttparasite! Eat me!

The Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS,
lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth.

The Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. Kay
slides down the Bug's throat, bending it sideways as he kicks and SCREAMS
his way down into its abdomen.

JAY looks on, in stunned horror...

AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a
<b>HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH.

Jay watches as the Bug continues its HOWL OF TRIUMPH...He feels totally
defeated. But...

He can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the Bug's stomach...

CLOSE ON BUG'S STOMACH. Through the leathery pouch of the Bug's stomach,
we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers...and just
a few inches from it, a HUMAN HAND is reaching toward the gun... KAY!

<b>INT. BUG - NIGHT
</b>
Kay, swimming in the Bug's intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the
gun, Holding his breath. Eyes stinging.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</b>
Jay knows what he has to do. He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete
dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttHey! Come over here and try that!

The concrete THUNKS off the Bug's shell -- he doesn't seem to notice; just
keeps moving.

Jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttStop right there, or I'll start wailing on
ttyour waxy, pointed ass!

Jay starts pounding on the Bug with the metal pole.

<b>INT. BUG - NIGHT
</b>
Kay almost has his fingers around the stock of the gun -- The POUNDING on
the outside distracts him and he turns -- the gun shifts away.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</b>
The Bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of Jay's hands. He swings at
Jay -- Jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass.

The Bug slices down with razor-sharp claws at Jay --

-- Jay rolls out of the way, just as the mean-looking claws dig into the
grass.

Jay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs. His hand falls on something in
the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a
dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently
vulnerable underbelly, right above him.

He grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up,
into the Bug's gut, when;

The Bug bends its head down between its legs.

BUG'S POV of Jay there, upside-down from this perspective, lurking between
the Bug's legs.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</b>
The Bug opens its jaws and SNAPS at Jay -- who propels himself backward
out of harm's way.

The Bug starts climbing the tower. Jay howls in frustration.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWhat are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand
ttand fight like an arthropod!

In frustration, Jay screams and throws himself on the Bug, hanging onto
its back, trying to drag it down.

<b>ttttJAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe
ttyou're a badass in your hive, but this is
ttNew York City. You're just another tourist
tthere!

The Bug flicks him off with his tail -- sending him SAILING twenty feet
through the air.

Jay CRASHES into the dumpster, landing on a heap in front of the garbage.

But, scratched and beat-up, Jay still doesn't quit -- he stands to yell at
the Bug, extending his arm at the creature.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou're messing with the wrong species, Bug --

He notices something on his arm...a cockroach running down his sleeve. He
flicks it off...

Looks down at the ground...sees another roach...looks over to the dumpster
behind him...there are more of them...a whole mob, in fact...fifty or
sixty of the critters, climbing out of a rusted hole in the dumpster...

Jay has one last desperate idea...He kicks at the dumpster -- part of the
side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ROACHES pouring forth from the dumpster, crawling
like a black glittering river, away from the garbage...

Jay leaps to his feet and moves to the glistening mob of insects...

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttHey, Bug!

CLOSE ON JAY'S FOOT as he steps on the roach.  CRUNCH.

ON THE BUG as he flinches on the ladder -- he hates that sound.

ON JAY. He smiles.

<b>ttttJAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttIf I'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of
ttyours.

He knows he's getting to him. He steps toward the Bug -- moving his foot
over another roach.

CRUNCH! He crushes another one.

<b>ttttJAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhoa! That had to hurt. And, what d'you
ttknow, here's your old Uncle Bob!

He steps forward again -- CRUNCH!

ON THE BUG. He turns around, anger burning in his eyes.

<b>INT. BUG - NIGHT
</b>
Kay's hand reaches closer and closer to the gun...

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY - NIGHT
</b>
Jay keeps moving toward the Bug, finding new roaches to tread on -- holds
his foot over another one.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWhat's that? Can you hear what he's saying?
tt'Help me! Help me!'

CRUNCH. [ON] THE BUG as he starts climbing down the tower and moving
toward Jay.

ON JAY. They are moving toward each other in a show down -- Jay moves on,
poising his foot over another roach.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttOoh! There's a pretty one. That one looks
ttkinda familiar, don't you think? I know who
ttthat is!

The Bug is right over Jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up.

<b>ttttBUG
</b>ttDon't do that!

Jay stares right back at the Bug. Inside, he sees Kay's hand, closing
around the trigger of the shotgun. He brings it around, pointing up,
straight at the Bug's head.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttThat's your Momma!

He moves to CRUNCH the roach -- The Bug moves to chomp Jay -- Jay stares
up at him, unflinching...

<b>ttttJAY (CONT'D)
</b>ttDidn't she ever teach you not to bite off
ttmore than you can chew?

and at that very moment...

Kay BLASTS a hole right in the middle of the Bug's midsection. The front
of the Bug's thorax EXPLODES in a shower of bug juice all over Jay.

The Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end sailing one way; the head
flying behind Jay.

Kay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping
the atomizer from his slippery fingers.

The other gun sails off into the darkness.

The ICON drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay's feet, and CLATTERS to
rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor.

He calmly bends down and picks it up. Jay is pissed and starts in on Kay.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou son of a --

Kay holds up a finger in a 'wait a minute' gesture -- pulls out his pocket
phone and hits a number.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttZed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We
tthave the galaxy.

<b>INT. MIB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
Zed is standing at the console, a smile on his face. He glances over at
the console that displays alien arrivals and departures on the earth. The
red lights are coming back on.

<b>ttttZED
</b>ttI think the word's already out. Our friends
ttare coming back.
ttt(then)
ttGot an authorized landing at Times Square.
ttYou and Jay check it out on the way back...
ttAnd pick me up one of those soft pretzels,
ttwhile you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like
ttcelebrating.

<b>EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</b>
Kay flips the phone closed.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou were saying?

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttGetting eaten!? That was your plan!?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(shrugs)
ttWorked.

As they argue, behind them, unseen, THE FRONT HALF OF THE BUG RAISES
ITSELF UP on its forearms, eyes gleaming with hate, jaws dripping -- ready
to lower itself onto Kay and Jay.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttAfter I got the shit beat out of me!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAnd I almost got digested. It goes with the
ttjob.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttYou coulda told me what you were doing.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThere wasn't time, sport!

HISSS! The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. They turn to see
it, and just before the jaws snap down on their heads...

BOOM! The Bug's head explodes into a million bits. Bug juice showers down
everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further.

They turn to see...

LAUREL standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the
barrel smoking, the weapon and Laurel dripping the Bug innards.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttInteresting job you guys got.

ON THE SKY. Bits of Bug juice still flying through the air.

<b>INT. A CAR ON THE ADJOINING FREEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
The driver sees something tumbling toward the windshield. He winces.

<b>-- AND THE BUG'S REMAINS SPLAT AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD.
</b>
The driver grimaces at the mess.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttDamn bugs.

He reaches down and hits a button. Wiper fluid squirts onto the windshield
and the wipers spread the bug goo everywhere.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Kay's LTD is parked outside Men in Black headquarters. LAUREL leans her
back against the car.  We see JAY and KAY walking away in the distance.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttLook, I know we got rules, but she did just
ttbust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you
ttdon't have to flashy thing her.

Kay pulls out the neuralyzer.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttWho's she gonna tell, anyway? She only
tthangs out with dead people.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttNot her. Me.
ttt(looking up at the sky)
ttThey're beautiful, aren't they? The stars.
ttI never just look anymore and they're
ttbeautiful.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttKay, you're scaring your partner.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI haven't been training a partner -- I've
ttbeen training a replacement.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttOh no, I can't do this job by myself.

<b>ttttLAUREL
</b>ttt(walking towards them)
ttHey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment.
ttWe're not even on the right island.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMaybe you won't have to.

Kay starts dialing back the neuralyzer.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttDays. Months. Years. Always face it
ttforwards.

He hands the neuralyzer to Jay. Taps his pocket. Indicates for him to put
his glasses on. Jay resists.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI've just been down the gullet of an
ttinterstellar cockroach. That's one of a
tthundred memories I don't want.

Jay takes the neuralyzer. Slips on his glasses.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttSee you around, sport.

Jay raises the neuralyzer. With a brilliant FLASH, the screen turns white.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttNo, you won't.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY
</b>
CLOSE ON various tabloid headlines as a hand flicks through them. Here's
one:
ttt Mets' Centerfielder Says:
<b>tt     "UFO MADE ME MISS HOME RUN BALL!"
</b>And here's another one:
<b>tt    DETROIT HAS CAR THAT DEFIES GRAVITY!
</b>tttSecret Tests in N.Y.'s Tunnel
And a third:
<b>tttMAN AWAKENS FROM 30-YEAR COMA
</b>tt        Returns to Girl He Left Behind

A large photograph shows a smiling KAY, arm-in-arm with ELIZABETH RESTON,
his long-lost fiancee, in her back yard in Tempe, Arizona.

She holds a large bouquet of flowers, the same kind he brought but never
gave her thirty years ago.

JAY, who's reading the paper, smiles.

AT THE CURB, Jay hurries back to the LTD with the newspapers. ELLE,
(formerly Laurel), is waiting, leaning against the hood. Tailored black
suit. Black shoes. Short-cropped hair. The look never looked better.

<b>ttttELLE
</b>ttZed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9
ttemissary wants floor seats to the Knicks --
ttBulls game.

<b>ttttJAY
</b>ttI'll talk to Dennis Rodman, it's his damn
ttplanet.

<b>ttttELLE
</b>ttLet's roll.

Both car doors SLAM, Jay drops it in gear, and the LTD BLASTS away from
the curb.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK CITY BLOCK - DAY
</b>
The LTD is just one of many cars in a jam-packed Manhattan city block.

<b>FROM UP IN THE CLOUDS
</b>
Manhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl.

<b>FROM THE STRATOSPHERE
</b>
The east coast of the United States is just part of a much larger land
mass.

<b>FROM THE EOSPHERE
</b>
North America is just a small portion of the planet Earth.

<b>FROM SPACE
</b>
Earth is just a tiny ball in our solar system.

<b>FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MILKY WAY
</b>
Our solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field.

<b>FROM OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY
</b>
The Milky Way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy
spirals.

<b>FROM THE OUTER REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE
</b>
There seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to
close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists
seems to be contained in one tiny ball --

-- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red
dirt.

An ALIEN HAND reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering
and bouncing across the dirt, where it CLICKS into a dozen other big blue
balls just like it.

<b>ttttFADE OUT.
