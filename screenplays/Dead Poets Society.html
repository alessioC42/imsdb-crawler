<b>INT. WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
A young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother
adjusts his tie.

<b>ttttMOTHER
</b>ttNow remember, keep your shoulders back.

A student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young
boy and his brother line up for a photograph

<b>ttttPHOTOGRAPHER
</b>ttOkay, put your arm around your brother.
ttThat's it. And breathe in.

The young boy blinks as the flash goes off.

<b>ttttPHOTOGRAPHR
</b>ttOkay, one more.

An old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old
man's duties.

<b>ttttTEACHER
</b>ttNow just to review, you're going to
ttfollow along the procession until you
ttget to the headmaster. At that point
tthe will indicate to you to light the
ttcandles of the boys.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttAll right boys, let's settle down.

The various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding
banners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the
bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttBanners up.

The boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The
small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a
church. The pews are filled with students and parents while the
teachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church
behind the headmaster.

The boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The
bagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old
man carrying the candle.

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttLadies and gentlemen, boys, the light
ttof knowledge.

An organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands
to the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and
he bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the
candle of the boy next to him.

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttOne hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this
ttroom and were asked the same question that greets
ttyou at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what
ttare the four pillars?

All throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who
is not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them.

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>ttTradition, honor, discipline, excellence.

The boys quickly return to their seats.

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttIn her first year, Welton Academy graduated five
ttstudents. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And
ttmore than seventy-five percent of those went on to
ttthe Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is
ttthe result of fervent dedication to the principles taught
tthere. This is why you parents have been sending us
ttyour sons. This is why we are the best preparatory
ttschool in the United States.

Mr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience.

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttAs you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English
ttdepartment retired last term. You will have the
ttopportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John
ttKeating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,
ttfor the past several years, has been teaching at the
tthighly regarded Chester School in London.

The crowd applauds once again.

<b>EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY
</b>
The school lawn is a filled with luggage, students, and parents mulling
about in every direction.

<b>INT CHURCH ENTRANCE - DAY
</b>
Mr Nolan stands by the entrance, speaking with each family as they leave.

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttGlad you could come by.

<b>ttttMR ANDERSON
</b>ttThrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan.

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttYou've been away too long.

<b>ttttMRS ANDERSON
</b>ttHello Dr. Nolan.

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttGood to have you back.

<b>ttttMRS ANDERSON
</b>ttThis is our youngest, Todd.

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttMr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill,
ttyoung man. Your brother was one of our finest.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttThank you.

Todd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttLovely ceremony.

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttThank you. So glad you liked it.

MR PERRY approaches with his son Neil. He shakes Mr. Nolan's hand.

<b>ttttMR PERRY
</b>ttGale

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttTom

<b>ttttMR PERRY
</b>ttGood to see you again.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttHello Mr. Nolan.

<b>ttttMR NOLAN
</b>ttNeil. We expect great things from you this year.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttThank you, sir.

<b>ttttMR PERRY
</b>ttWell he won't disappoint us. Right Neil?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI'll do my best sir.

<b>EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY
</b>
A bell tolls. Parents begin wishing their boys farewell.

<b>ttttFATHER
</b>ttHey, come on son.

<b>ttttMOTHER
</b>ttChin up.

<b>ttttFATHER
</b>ttNo tears now.

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttOkay.

<b>ttttMOTHER
</b>ttChin up.

Another boy hugs his mother.

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttI don't want to go here.

<b>ttttMOTHER
</b>ttYou be a good boy and do your lessons.

<b>EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY
</b>
Neil emerges from a building and sees Todd.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttHey, I hear we're gonna be roommates.

He shakes Todd's hand.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI'm Neil Perry.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttTodd Anderson.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWhy'd you leave Balincrest?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttMy brother went here.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttOh, so you're that Anderson.

<b>INT DORMATORY - DAY
</b>
DR. HAGER is standing in his room doorway while SPAZ and his father are
going over some last minute precautions over the boy's allergies. Spaz's
father hands Hager various bottles.

<b>ttttFATHER
</b>ttThis is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you
ttgive him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing
ttyou can give him some of those.

<b>ttttHAGER
</b>ttAll right fine.

Dr. Hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room, shutting
the door.

<b>ttttFATHER
</b>ttt    (to son)
ttDid you remember your vaporizer?

<b>ttttSPAZ
</b>ttYes, I put it in my room.

Spaz's father tries to say something else to Dr. Hager but realizes he
has already gone.

<b>INT HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Neil pushes his way through a crowd of boys, carrying two suitcases. As
he enters his room, Knox quickly passes by.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttHey, how's it going Neil?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttHey Knox.

Cameron comes by and leans against the doorway.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttNeil, study group tonight?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYeah, sure.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttBusiness as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new
ttkid. Looks like a stiff!

He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttOops!

Cameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters
the room and sets his luggage down on his bed.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttListen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his
ttfoot in his mouth. You know what I mean?

He pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd 
across the back with it.

CHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and
MEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttRumor has it, you did summer school.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
ttHow was your summer Slick?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttKeen.

The boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who is
just entering. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttMeeks. Door. Closed.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttYes sir.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttGentlemen, what are the four pillars?

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>ttTravesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.

Charlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.
Meanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOkay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite
ttflunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study
ttgroup.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttSure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind
ttincluding him?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttCome on, he's your roommate.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThat's not my fault.

Meeks seems to notice Todd for the first time.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttOh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks.

Neil quickly gets up from his spot by the window.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttOh, this is Todd Anderson.

Todd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttNice to meet you.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttNice to meet you.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCharlie Dalton.

Charlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttKnox Overstreet.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttTodd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar. 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttOh well, welcome to Hell-ton.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a
ttgenius like Meeks.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttHe flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAnd English, and Trig.

Charlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly
stamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke
from the air.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttIt's open.

The door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises from
the window.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttFather, I thought you'd gone.

The other boys stand up when he enters.

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>ttMr. Perry.

<b>ttttMR PERRY
</b>ttKeep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've
ttjust spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking
tttoo many extra curricular activities this semester, and
ttI've decided that you should drop the school annual.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttBut I'm the assistant editor this year.

<b>ttttMR PERRY
</b>ttWell I'm sorry Neil.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttBut Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.

<b>ttttMR PERRY
</b>ttFellas, would you excuse us for a moment?

Mr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perry
pauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
The smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face. He grabs a hold of Neil's arm.

<b>ttttMR PERRY
</b>ttDon't you ever dispute me in public. Do you
ttunderstand?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttFather, I wasn't disputing-

<b>ttttMR PERRY
</b>After you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then you
can do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you.
Is that clear?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYes sir. I'm sorry.

<b>ttttMR PERRY
</b>ttYou know how much this means to your mother,
ttdon't you?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYes sir. You know me, always taking on too much.

<b>ttttMR PERRY
</b>ttWell, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,
ttyou let us know, huh?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYes sir.

Mr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his head
back against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhy doesn't he let you do what you want?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttOh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.
ttFuture Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOkay, so I don't like it any more than you do.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWell just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You
ttguys are the same way.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttAll right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWhat I have to do. Drop the annual.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a
ttbunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttWell, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttTodd, you're welcome to join us.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYeah, come along pal.

Todd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttThanks.

<b>EXT. FIELDS - DAY
</b>
A clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparently
disturbed by the noise, take to the sky.

<b>INT. STAIRCASE - DAY
</b>
The sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they
descend the stairs in a long spiralling line.

MR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttSlow down boys, slow down you horrible
ttphalanx of pubescense.

<b>INT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY
</b>
A teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books.

<b>ttttTEACHER
</b>ttPick three laboratory experiments from
ttthe project list and report on them every
ttfive weeks. The first twenty questions at
ttthe end of chapter one are due tomorrow.

The students let out a collective groan.

<b>INT. LATIN CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Mr. McAllister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and gets
the students to repeat everything he says.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttt    (students repeat after each word.)
ttAgricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.
ttAgricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.
ttAgrilcolis.

ttAgain, please.
ttAgricola.

<b>INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Dr. Hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back.

<b>ttttHAGER
</b>ttYour study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.
ttAnyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will
ttbe penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge
ttyou now not to test me on this point.

<b>INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Students enter Keating's classroom, talking and acting up. Keating
glances out from his room off to one side.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttHey Spaz, Spaz.

Spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper
while Cameron smacks him on the shoulder.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttBrain damage.

The students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,
whistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom and
out the door without a word. The students look around at one another,
uncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttWell come on.

He gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab
their books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway. 

<b>INT. ENTRANCEWAY - DAY
</b>
Keating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until all
the boys arrive.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>tt"Oh Captain, My Captain" who knows where
ttthat comes from?

Todd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. Spaz blows his
nose a little too close to Meeks for his liking.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNot a clue? It's from a poem by Walt
ttWhitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in
ttthis class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,
ttif you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,
ttMy Captain.

The students laugh slightly.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNow let me dispel a few rumors so they
ttdon't fester into facts. Yes, I too
ttattended Hell-ton and survived. And no,
ttat that time I was not the mental giant
ttyou see before you. I was the intellectual
ttequivalent of a ninety-eight pound
ttweakling. I would go to the beach and
ttpeople would kick copies of Byron in my
ttface.

The boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write all
this down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in his
hand.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNow, Mrx85 Pitts. That's a rather
ttunfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are
ttyou?

Pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>Mr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first
stanza of the poem you find there?

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>tt"To the virgins, to make much of time"?

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttYes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,
ttisn't it.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>tt"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old
tttime is still a flying, and this same
ttflower that smiles today, tomorrow will
ttbe dying."

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThank you Mr. Pitts. "Gather ye rosebuds
ttwhile ye may." The Latin term for that
ttsentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows
ttwhat that means?

Meeks immediately puts his hand up.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttCarpe Diem. That's "seize the day."

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttVery good, Mr.-

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttMeeks.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttMeeks. Another unusual name. Seize the
ttday. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.
ttWhy does the writer use these lines?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBecause he's in a hurry.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNo, ding!

Keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThank you for playing anyway. Because we
ttare food for worms lads. Because, believe
ttit or not, each and every one of us in
ttthis room is one day going to stop
ttbreathing, turn cold, and die. 

Keating turns towards the trophy cases, filled with trophies, footballs,
and team pictures.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNow I would like you to step forward over
tthere and peruse some of the faces from
ttthe past. You've walked past them many
tttimes. I don't think you've really looked
ttat them.

The students slowly gather round the cases and Keating moves behind them.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThey're not that different from you, are
ttthey? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,
ttjust like you. Invincible, just like you
ttfeel. The world is their oyster. They
ttbelieve they're destined for great things,
ttjust like many of you. Their eyes are full
ttof hope, just like you. Did they wait until
ttit was too late to make from their lives
tteven one iota of what they were capable?
ttBecause you see gentlmen, these boys are
ttnow fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen
ttreal close, you can hear them whisper their
ttlegacy to you. Go on, lean in.

The boys lean in and Keating hovers over Cameron's shoulder.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttt    (whispering in a gruff voice)
ttCarpe.

Cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttHear it?
ttt    (whispering again)
ttCarpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,
ttmake your lives extraordinary.

The boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence.

<b>EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - DAY
</b>
The boys emerge from the school, loaded down with numerous books.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttThat was weird.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttBut different.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttSpooky if you ask me.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttThink he'll test us on that stuff?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCome on Cameron, don't you get anything?

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWhat? What?

<b>INT. LOCKER ROOM - EVENING
</b>
A coach sticks his head around the corner into the room.

<b>ttttCOACH
</b>ttLet's go boys, hustle up in here. That
ttmeans you Dalton.

Meeks emerges from the showers, drying himself off.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttOkay, who's up for a trig study group
tttonight guys?

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttMe.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttMe.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(still annoyed by what the coach said)
ttWhat?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttI can't make it guys. I have to have
ttdinner at the Danburry's house.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttThe Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's?

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttBig alumns. How'd you swing that?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttFriends of my Dad's. They're probably in
tttheir nineties or something.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOoh!

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttAnything's better than Hell-ton hash.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll second that.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYeah we'll see.

Neil approaches Todd, who's been sitting by the window staring down at the
floor. Neil snaps his fingers to get Todd's attention. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttHey, you coming to the study group tonight?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttUh, no, no I, uh, I've got some history I
ttwanna do.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttSuit yourself.

<b>INT. TODD'S ROOM - EVENING
</b>
Todd is seated at his desk. He scrawls "CARPE DIEM" across a blank page
of his notebook. He looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it up
and opening up his Chemistry book.

<b>INT. ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Hager comes down the stairs. Knox is looking at one of the old class photos
on the walls.

<b>ttttHAGER
</b>ttReady Overstreet?

Knox reluctantly follows after Dr. Hager.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttReady to go sir.

<b>EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
The car leaves Welton and drives towards the Danburry's house.

<b>INT / EXT DANBURRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
The doorbell rings.

<b>ttttMRS DANBURRY (O.S.)
</b>ttChet, can you get that?

<b>ttttCHET (O.S.)
</b>ttI can't, Mom.

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttI'll get it.

The door opens and Knox is awe-struck by the beautiful girl (CHRIS) who
has answered the door.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttCan I help you?

Knox manages to break out of his daze.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttHi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttHi.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttThis is the Danburry's, right?

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttAre you here to see Chet?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttMrs. Danburry?

Chris begins to laugh as Mrs. Danburry arrives behind her.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttMRS DANBURRY
</b>ttSorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.
ttYou must be Knox.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttMRS DANBURRY
</b>ttt    (to Dr. Hager)
ttBack by nine.
ttt    (to Knox)
ttPlease come in.

<b>ttttCHET (O.S.)
</b>ttChris, come on, what are you doing?

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttChet, I'm coming.

Knox enters the house, his mind still hung up on Chris as MR DANBURRY
comes out of the living room to meet him.

<b>ttttMR DANBURRY
</b>ttKnox. How are you? Joe Danburry.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttNice to meet you sir.

<b>ttttMR DANBURRY
</b>ttWell he's the spitting image of his father,
ttisn't he. How is he? Come on in.

<b>ttttCHET (O.S.)
</b>ttChris!

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttHe's great. He just did a big case for GM.

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttI'm coming.

<b>ttttMR DANBURRY
</b>ttI know where you're headed, like father
ttlike son, huh?

<b>INT. STUDENT LOUNGE - NIGHT
</b>
Several students are throwing darts at a small rubber skeleton hanging
from the bulletin board. Various students are studying and playing games.
Meeks and Pitts are sitting at one table working on their "hi-fi system".
Meeks is waving an antenna around with no luck. Pitts points out to him
that he forgot to plug it in. Neil, Cameron, and Charlie are working on
their trig homework.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttJust replace these numbers here with "x",
ttfor "x" and "y".

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttOf course.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttOf course, so what's the problem?

Charlie enters the room and closes the door behind him, leaning up
against it heavily.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHow was dinner?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHow was dinner?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttTerrible. Awful.

He leaves the door and sits down with the other boys.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhy? What happened?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttTonight, I met the most beautiful girl
ttin my entire life.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttAre you crazy? What's wrong with that?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttShe's practically engaged. To Chet Danburry.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThat guy could eat a football.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttThat's too bad.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttToo bad? It's worse than too bad Pitsie,
ttit's a tragedy. A girl this beautiful in
ttlove with such a jerk.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttAll the good ones go for jerks, you
ttknow that.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttAhh, forget her. Open your trig book and
tttry and figure out problem five.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttI can't just forget her Cameron. And I
ttcan't think about trig.

The radio Meeks and Pitts were working on begins letting out a high
pitched hum.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttWe got it.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttHoly cow.

Mr. Hager walks into the room.

<b>ttttHAGER
</b>ttAll right gentlemen, five minutes. Let's
ttgo.

The students quickly pack up their gear and prepare to leave. Pitts tries
to hide the radio in his lap. Charlie leans in close to Knox.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDid you see her naked?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttVery funny Dalton.

<b>ttttHAGER
</b>ttThat wouldn't be a radio in your lap,
ttwould it Mr. Pitts?

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttNo sir. Science experiment, radar.

Meeks holds up the antenna as if demonstrating it.

<b>INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one
of his books.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttGentlemen, open your text to page
tttwenty-one of the introduction. Mr.
ttPerry, will you read the opening
ttparagraph of the preface, entitled
tt"Understanding Poetry"?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttUnderstanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans
ttPritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand
ttpoetry, we must first be fluent with
ttits meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.
ttThen ask two questions: One, how artfully
tthas the objective of the poem been
ttrendered, and two, how important is that
ttobjective. Question one rates the poem's
ttperfection, question two rates its
ttimportance. And once these questions have
ttbeen answered, determining a poem's
ttgreatest becomes a relatively simple
ttmatter.

Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttIf the poem's score for perfection is
ttplotted along the horizontal of a graph,
ttand its importance is plotted on the
ttvertical, then calculating the total
ttarea of the poem yields the measure of
ttits greatness.

Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students
dutifully copy it down.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttA sonnet by Byron may score high on the
ttvertical, but only average on the
tthorizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on
ttthe other hand, would score high both
tthorizontally and vertically, yielding a
ttmassive total area, thereby revealing the
ttpoem to be truly great. As you proceed
ttthrough the poetry in this book, practice
ttthis rating method. As your ability to
ttevaluate poems in this matter grows, so
ttwill - so will your enjoyment and
ttunderstanding of poetry.

Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sitting
across from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away from
the chalkboard with a smile.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttExcrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.
ttEvans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,
ttwe're talking about poetry.

Cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly
scribbles it out.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttI mean, how can you describe poetry like
ttAmerican Bandstand? I like Byron, I give
tthim a 42, but I can't dance to it.

Charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNow I want you to rip out that page.

The students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttGo on, rip out the entire page. You heard
ttme, rip it out. Rip it out!

Charlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes,
which consists of drawing breasts.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttGo on, rip it out.

Charlie rips the page out and holds it up.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you
ttwhat, don't just tear out that page, tear
ttout the entire introduction. I want it
ttgone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip
ttit out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,
ttPh.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I
ttwant to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.
ttPritchard.

Meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttWe'll perforate it, put it on a roll.

Keating sees Cameron still hesitating.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttIt's not the bible, you're not going to
ttgo to hell for this. Go on, make a clean
tttear, I want nothing left of it.

Keating goes over to his room. Cameron turns around to Neil.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWe shouldn't be doing this.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttRip, rip, rip!

Neil makes Cameron turn back around.

<b>ttttKEATING (O.S.)
</b>ttRip it out, rip!

From outside the classroom, Mr. McAllister hears all the noise and sees
all the students ripping out the pages. He bursts into the room.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttWhat the hell is going on here?

The boys all turn around in shock. Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his
mouth. Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttI don't hear enough rips.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttMr. Keating.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttMr. McAllister.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttI'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were
tthere.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttI am.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttAhh, so you are. Excuse me.

Mr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttKeep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,
tta war. And the casualties could be your
tthearts and souls. 

Keating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics
ttgoing forward, measuring poetry. No, we
ttwill not have that here. No more of Mr.
ttJ. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you
ttwill learn to think for yourselves again.
ttYou will learn to savor words and language.
ttNo matter what anybody tells you, words and
ttideas can change the world. I see that look
ttin Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century
ttliterature has nothing to do with going to
ttbusiness school or medical school. Right?
ttMaybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, 
ttthinking "Yes, we should simply study our
ttMr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter
ttand go quietly about the business of
ttachieving other ambitions." I have a little
ttsecret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up! 

The boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the center
of the class.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttWe don't read and write poetry because
ttit's cute. We read and write poetry
ttbecause we are members of the human race.
ttAnd the human race is filled with passion.
ttMedicine, law, business, engineering,
ttthese are all noble pursuits, and necessary
ttto sustain life. But poetry, beauty,
ttromance, love, these are what we stay alive
ttfor. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life
ttof the questions of these recurring, of the
ttendless trains of the faithless, of cities
ttfilled with the foolish. What good amid
ttthese, o me, o life? Answer: that you are
tthere. That life exists, and identity.
ttThat the powerful play goes on, and you
ttmay contribute a verse. That the powerful
ttplay goes on and you may contribute a verse.

Keating looks up at Todd.

ttttKeating
ttWhat will your verse be?

<b>INT. HEAD OF CAFETERIA - DAY
</b>
The cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables saying grace.

<b>ttttALL
</b>ttFor what we are about to receive, may the
ttLord make us truly grateful. Amen.

Mr. Keating and Mr. McAllister are seated next to one another at the table.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttQuite an interesting class you gave today,
ttMr. Keating.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttI'm sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttOh, there's no need to apologize. It was
ttvery fascinating, misguided though it was.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttYou think so?

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttYou take a big risk by encouraging them to
ttbe artists John. When they realize they're
ttnot Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,
ttthey'll hate you for it.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttWe're not talking artists George, we're
tttalking free thinkers.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttFree thinkers at seventeen?

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttFunny, I never pegged you as a cynic.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttt  (taken aback by the comment)
ttNot a cynic, a realist. Show me the heart
ttunfettered by foolish dreams, and I'll
ttshow you a happy man.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttBut only in their dreams can man be truly
ttfree. 'Twas always thus, and always thus
ttwill be.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttTennyson?

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNo, Keating.

Keating winks and Mr. McAllister can't help but laugh.

<b>INT. CAFETERIA TABLE - DAY
</b>
Neil joins the others at the table. He pulls out a yearbook.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttHey, I found his senior annual in the
ttlibrary.

He hands the annual over to Cameron who laughs at the younger picture of Keating.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttListen to this, captain of the soccer team,
tteditor of the school annual, Cambridge
ttbound, Thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttt    (reading from the annual)
ttMan most likely to do anything.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttWhat's the Dead Poets Society?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttIs there a picture in the annual?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNothing. No other mention of it.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN (O.S.)
</b>ttThat boy there, see me after lunch.

Cameron quickly puts the annual away and the others all return to their meal.

<b>EXT. WELTON GROUNDS - DAY
</b>
Keating is walking down towards the lake, whistling the same tune as before.
The boys emerge from the building and chase after him.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttMr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,
ttMy Captain?

Keating immediately turns around.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttGentlemen.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWe were just looking in your old annual.

He hands Keating the annual and Keating looks at his old photograph.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttOh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley
tt"The Tool" Wilson-

Keating crouches down and continues looking through the book.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttGod.

Neil crouches down next to Keating.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWhat was the Dead Poets Society?

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttI doubt the present administration would
ttlook too favorably upon that.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWhy? What was it?

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttGentlemen, can you keep a secret?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttSure.

The other boys crouch down around Keating.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThe Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking
ttthe marrow out of life. That's a phrase
ttfrom Thoreau that we'd invoke at the
ttbeginning of each meeting. You see we'd
ttgather at the old Indian cave and take
ttturns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,
ttShelley; the biggies. Even some of our
ttown verse. And in the enchantment of the
ttmoment we'd let poetry work its magic.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYou mean it was a bunch of guys sitting
ttaround reading poetry?

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNo Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just "guys",
ttwe weren't a Greek organization, we were
ttromantics. We didn't just read poetry,
ttwe let it drip from our tongues like honey.
ttSpirits soared, women swooned, and gods
ttwere created, gentlemen, not a bad way to
ttspend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry
ttfor this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,
ttespecially my picture.

Keating hands the annual back and walks away, whistling once again. Neil
remains crouched.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttDead Poets Society.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWhat?

The school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school.
Neil stands up.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI say we go tonight.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttTonight?

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWait a minute.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttWhere's this cave he's talking about?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttIt's beyond the stream. I know where it
ttis.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttThat's miles.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttSounds boring to me.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDon't go.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttYou know how many de-merits we're talking
ttDalton

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttSo don't come, please.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttLook, all I'm saying is that we have to
ttbe careful, we can't get caught.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNo shit, Sherlock.

<b>ttttHAGER
</b>tttt(yelling)
ttYou boys there, hurry up.

Neil turns around and faces the other boys.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttAll right, who's in?

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttCome on Neil, Hager's right-

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttForget Hager, no. Who's in?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm in.

<b>ttttHAGER (O.S.)
</b>ttI'm warning you, move.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttMe too.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttI don't know Neil

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWhat? Pitts-

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttPitsie, come on.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttHis grades are hurting Charlie.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYou can help him Meeks.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttWhat is this, a midnight study group?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttForget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,
ttare your grades hurting too?

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttI'll try anything once.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttExcept sex.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttHa ha ha.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttI mean as long as we're careful.

The boys run into the building.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat about you Knox?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttI don't know Charlie.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCome on Knox, it'll help you get Chris.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYeah? How?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWomen swoon.

Charlie laughs and runs inside. Knox chases after him.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttBut why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me
ttwhy they swoon. Charlie!

<b>INT LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
The boys are all gathered around one of the tables with a map laid out
on it.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttt    (whispering)
ttOkay, follow the stream to the waterfall.
ttIt's right there. It's got to be on the
ttbanks.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttI don't know, it's starting to sound
ttdangerous.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, why don't you stay home?

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttFor God's sake stop chattering and
ttsit down.

The boys take their seats once again and Neil goes over and sits next to
Todd, who is sitting by himself.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttTodd, are you coming tonight?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWhy not? God, you were there. You heard
ttKeating. Don't you want to do something
ttabout it?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttYes, but-

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttBut? But what?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttKeating said that everybody took turns
ttreading and I don't want to do that.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttGosh, you really have a problem with
ttthat, don't you?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttN- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,
ttI just- I just don't want to do it,
ttokay?

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttAll right. What if you didn't have to
ttread? What if you just came and
ttlistened?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttThat's not how it works.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttForget how it works. What if - what if
ttthey said it was okay?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttWhat? What are you gonna do, go up and
ttask them?

Neil shrugs.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttNo. No, Neil.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI'll be right back.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttNeil, Neil!

Neil gets up and rejoins the others. McAllister hears the boys whispering
again.

<b>ttttMCALLISTER
</b>ttOh shut up, will you.

<b>INT BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Various boys are crowded around the sinks getting ready for bed. Someone
is playing snake charmer music on a kazoo while someone else is bothering
Spaz with a red sock puppet acting like a snake.

<b>ttttSPAZ
</b>ttThat's my- that's for my asthma, okay.
ttCould you give that back please? Could
ttyou give that back?

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttWhat's the matter? Don't you like snakes?

Neil enters and taps Todd on the shoulder.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYou're in.

<b>ttttSPAZ
</b>ttGet away from me, okay?

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttSpaz, why don't you check your pocket,
tthuh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my
ttteeth

<b>ttttSPAZ
</b>ttGet a- get off, 

Hager walks past the bathroom and into his room.

<b>ttttHAGER
</b>ttCut out that racket in there.

The kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping. Hager
glares at them for a moment.

<b>INT NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Neil stands in his doorway. He looks across the hall to the other room
where Cameron and Charlie are standing. Cameron gives a thumbs up. Neil
closes his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight. Setting
the flashlight down on the desk, he notices a worn book, "Five
Centuries of Verse", sitting there. Opening it up, he sees John Keating's
name at the top followed by "Dead Poets". Below the title of the book,
is written: "To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings." Along with
several lines from Thoreau, beginning with "I went to the woods because
I wanted to live deliberatelyx85"

<b>INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT
</b>
The shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkened
halls.

<b>INT HAGER'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Hager hears a dog barking.

<b>INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Someone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dog's feet. He stops
barking and immediately begins gobbling them down. Hager looks out
into the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing.

<b>EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT
</b>
The boys quietly leave the building and set off running across the
fields towards the woods.

<b>EXT WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
The boys search about the trees trying to find the cave. Meeks is
searching around when Charlie leaps up behind Meeks in the dark
shining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs Meeks by the
shoulder.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttArrr, I'm a dead poet.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttAww, Charlie.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt    (laughing)
ttGuys, over here.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttYou're funny. You're real funny.

<b>INT CAVE - NIGHT
</b>
The boys are trying to start a fire. The cave is quickly filling up with
smoke.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttIt's too wet.

<b>CHARLIE
</b>ttGod, are you trying to smoke us out of
tthere?

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttNo, no, the smoke's going right up this
ttopening.

Pitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling. He
lets out a yell while the others laugh.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYou okay?

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttOh God. Clowns.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttAll right, all right, forget the fire.
ttLet's go gentlemen.

Neil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a drag
on a cigarette.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI hereby reconvene the Dead Poets
ttSociety.

The boys cheer.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWelton chapter. The meetings will be
ttconducted by myself and the other new
ttinitiates now present. Todd Anderson,
ttbecause he prefers not to read, will
ttkeep minutes of the meetings. I'll now
ttread the traditional opening message by
ttsociety member Henry David Thoreau. "I
ttwent to the woods because I wanted to
ttlive deliberately. I wanted to live deep
ttand suck out all the marrow of life."

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll second that.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>tt"To put to rout all that was not life,
ttand not, when I had come to die,
ttdiscover that I had not lived.

Several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttAnd Keating's marked a bunch of other
ttpages.

Neil begins flipping through the book.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAll right, intermission. Dig deep right
tthere. Right here, lay it down

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttOn the mud? We're gonna put our food on
ttthe mud?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttMeeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttYes sir, use Meeks' coat.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDon't keep anything back either. You
ttguys are always bumming my smokes.

Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it. Amongst
the pile are chocolate chip cookies, a box of raisins, a few apples, an
orange, and half a roll.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttRaisins?

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYuck.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWait a minute, who gave us half a roll?

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttt  (talking with his mouth full)
ttI'm eating the other half.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCome on.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttYou want me to put it back?

<b>INT CAVE - NIGHT
</b>
Neil, lit up by a flashlight, begins to tell everyone a story.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttIt was a dark and rainy night, and this
ttold lady, who had a passion for jigsaw
ttpuzzles, sat by herself in her house at
tther table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.
ttBut as she pieced the puzzle together, she
ttrealized, to her astonishment, that the
ttimage that was formed was her very own
ttroom. And the figure in the center of the
ttpuzzle, as she completed it, was herself.
ttAnd with trembling hands, she placed the
ttlast four pieces and stared in horror at
ttthe face of a demented madman at the
ttwindow. The last thing that this old lady
ttever heard was the sound of breaking glass.

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>ttOhhhx85 nox85

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttThis is true, this is true.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttI've got one that's even better than
ttthat.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHa!

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttI do. There's a young, married couple,
ttand they're driving through the forest
ttat night on a long trip. And they run
ttout of gas, and there's a madman on the-

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThe thing with the hand-

All the boys react, recalling the story and miming the scraping on the
roof of the car.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttI love that story.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI told you that one.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttYou did not. I got that in camp in
ttsixth grade.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhen were you in six, last year?

As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from the
book.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>tt"In a mean abode in the shanking road,
ttlived a man named William Bloat. Now,
tthe had a wife, the plague of his life,
ttwho continually got his goat. And one
ttday at dawn, with her nightshift on,
tthe slit her bloody throat."

The boys laugh.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttOh, and it gets worse.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou want to hear a real poem?

Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAll right? No, I don't need it. You take 
ttit. 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttWhat, did you bring one? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYou memorized a poem? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI didn't memorize a poem. Move up.

Neil moves to the side as Charlie stands and takes his spot.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttAn original piece by Charlie Dalton. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttAn original piece. 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttTake center stage. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYou know this is history. Right? This is 
tthistory.

Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and 
slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds,
Miss October, 1959)

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttOh, wow. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWhere did you get that? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>
ttTeach me to love? Go teach thyself more 
ttwit.
ttI, chief professor, am of it.

Neil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he is
reading.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThe god of love, if such a thing there 
ttbe, may learn to love from me.

Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWow! Did you write that?

Charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written down
the poem.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAbraham Cowley. Okay, who's next? 

Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttAlfred Lord Tennyson. 
ttCome my friends, 
tt'Tis not too late to seek a newer world 
ttfor my purpose holds to sail beyond the

ttAnd though we are not now that strength 
ttwhich in old days 
ttMoved earth and heaven; that which we 
ttare, we are;-- 
ttOne equal temper of heroic hearts, 
ttMade weak by time and fate, but strong 
ttin will. 
ttTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to

Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is 
performing a chant.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttThen I had religion, then I had a

ttI could not turn from their revel in

Knox picks up a metal container and begins using it as a drum. The
other boys stand and begin going in a circle, making music with
sticks of wood, combs, etc.

<b>INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Keating is walking to the front of the classroom filled with students.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttA man is not very tire, he is exhausted.
ttAnd don't use very sad, use-

He points to the back of the classroom.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttCome on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp, 
<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttMorose? 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttExactly! Morose. Now, language was 
ttdeveloped for one endeavor, and that is? 
ttMr. Anderson? Come on! Are you a man or 
ttan amoeba?

Keating stands before Todd's desk. Todd looks up nervously but
says nothing. Keating paused for a moment before looking away.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttMr. Perry? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttUh, to communicate. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNo! To woo women. Today we're going to 
ttbe talking about William Shakespeare. 

The class lets out a collective sigh.
<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttOh, God! 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttI know. A lot of you looked forward to 
ttthis about as much as you look forward 
ttto root canal work. We're gonna talk 
ttabout Shakespeare as someone who writes 
ttsomething very interesting. Now, many of 
ttyou have seen Shakespeare done very much 
ttlike this:

Keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to
speak in an exaggerated British accent.

tt"O Titus, bring your friend hither." But
ttif any of you have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,
ttyou know, Shakespeare can be different. 
tt"Friend, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
ttears." You can also imagine, maybe, John
ttWayne as Macbeth going, "Well, is this a 
ttdagger I see before me?"

<b>INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
The students are all seated together near the front of the room as
Keating reads from a book.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>tt"Dogs, sir? Oh, not just now. I do enjoy 
tta good dog once in a while, sir. You can 
tthave yourself a three-course meal from

ttparfait. And you can pick your teeth 
ttwith a little paw."

<b>INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
The students are all back in their normal seats and Keating leaps
up onto his desk.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttWhy do I stand up here? Anybody? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttTo feel taller. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNo!
Keating rings the bell on his desk with his foot

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThank you for playing, Mr. Dalton. I 
ttstand upon my desk to remind yourself 
ttthat we must constantly look at things 
ttin a different way. 

Keating glances around the classroom from atop the desk.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttYou see, the world looks very different 
ttfrom up here. You don't believe me? Come 
ttsee for yourself. Come on. Come on! 

Charlie and Neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front
of the classroom. The rest of the class follows them. While Keating
continues speaking, Neil and Charlie join him on the desk and then
Keating jumps down.


<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttJust when you think you know something, 
ttyou have to look at it in another way. 
ttEven though it may seem silly or wrong, 
ttyou must try! Now, when you read, don't 
ttjust consider what the author thinks. 
ttConsider what you think. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttBoys, you must strive to find your own 
ttvoice. Because the longer you wait to 
ttbegin, the less likely you are to find 
ttit at all. Thoreau said, "Most men lead 
ttlives of quiet desperation." Don't be 
ttresigned to that. Break out!

Keating notices Spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttDon't just walk off the edge like lemmings.
ttLook around you. 

The school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk.
Keating begins to gather up his stuff. The clock begins to toll as
Keating walks to the back of the class.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThere! There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank 
ttyou! Yes! Dare to strike out and find 
ttnew ground. Now, in addition to your 
ttessays, I would like you to compose a 
ttpoem of your own, an original work.

The students begin to groan. Keating begins flickering the lights
off and on while chanting ominously.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThat's right! You have to deliver it 
ttaloud in front of the class on Monday. 
ttBonne chance, gentlemen. 

Keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again.
Todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttMr. Anderson? Don't think that I don't 
ttknow that this assignment scares the 
tthell out of you, you mole.

Keating flicks the light off, leaving Todd to jump down in the darkness
as the students laugh.

<b>EXT. RIVER - DAY

Cameron, Charlie, and several other boys are rowing while Mr. Nolan
shouts orders from a bullhorn.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttTake a power train in two! Three! Keep

<b>EXT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP - DAY
</b>
Noisy static is replaced by music as Pitts climbs down form the peak to
join Meeks at their makeshift radio.

Several students are fencing on a grassy slope.

Meeks and Pitts perform a goofy dance together to the music.

<b>INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
Todd is on his bed trying to write a poem. The door opens and Todd
turns his writing pad over. Neil enters the room laughing. He crouches
down next to Todd's bed and plunks a sheet of paper in Todd's lap.


<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI found it. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttYou found what? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWhat I wanna do right now. What's 
ttreally, really inside me. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>tt"A Midsummer Night's Dream"? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttThis is it. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttWhat is this? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttIt's a play, dummy. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttI know that. I-- Wh-Wh-What does it have 
ttto do with you? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttRight. They're putting it on at Henley 
ttHall. Open tryouts. Open tryouts! 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttYes, so?

Neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed,
wearing it like a cloak.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttSo, I'm gonna act. Yes, yes! I'm gonna 
ttbe an actor! Ever since I can remember, 
ttI've wanted to try this. I even tried to 
ttgo to summer stock auditions last year, 
ttbut, of course, my father wouldn't let 
ttme. For the first time in my whole life 
ttI know what I wanna do.

Neil grabs a handful of papers off Todd's bed and tosses them into
the air.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttand for the first time I'm gonna do it 
ttwhether my father wants me to or not!
ttCarpe diem! 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttNeil, Neil, hold on a minute. How are 
ttyou gonna be in a play if your father 
ttwon't let you? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttFirst I gotta get the part, then I can 
ttworry about that. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttYeah, but won't he kill you if he finds 
ttout you went to an audition and didn't 
tteven tell him? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNo, no, no, no. As far as I'm concerned, 
tthe won't have to know about any of this. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttWell, that's impossible. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttBullshit! Nothing's impossible. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttWell, why don't you just call him and 
ttask him? And m-maybe he'll say yes. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttThat's a laugh!

Neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttIf I don't ask him, at least I won't
ttbe disobeying him. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttYeah, but if he said-- 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttt   (shouting angrily)
ttJesus, Todd! Whose side are you on?

Todd says nothing. Neil looks at him for a moment and then takes
the flyer back from Todd. He walks over to the window, his 
excitement gone.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI mean, I haven't even gotten the part 
ttyet. Can't I even enjoy the idea for a 
ttlittle while? 

Once again, Todd says nothing. After a moment, Neil sits on the
heater and Todd returns to his poem.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYou're coming to the meeting this 
ttafternoon? 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttI don't know. Maybe.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNothing Mr. Keating has to say means 
ttshit to you, does it, Todd? 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttW-What is that supposed to mean? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYou're in the club! Being in the club 
ttmeans being stirred up by things. You 
ttlook about as stirred up as a cesspool. 

Neil gets up from the window and stands over Todd.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttSo- You want me out? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNo! I want you in, but being in means 
ttyou gotta do something. Not just say 
ttyou're in. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttWell, listen, Neil. I-I appreciate this 
ttconcern, but I-I'm not like you. All 
ttright? You, you, you say thing and 
ttpeople listen. I'm, I'm not like that. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttDon't you think you could be? 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttNo! I--I, I don't know, but that's not 
ttthe point. The, the, the point is that 
ttthere's nothing you can do about it, so 
ttyou can just butt out. I can take care 
ttof myself just fine. All right? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNo. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttWhat do you mean, "no"? 

A smile comes to Neil's face.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNo. 

Neil grabs Todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with 
it. Todd leaps up after him.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttGive me-- Neil. Neil, give that back. 

The two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping from
bed to bed as Todd tries to grab his poem back.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>tt"We are dreaming of a--" Poetry! I'm 
ttbeing chased by Walt Whitman! Okay, 
ttokay.

Neil drops the notebook. Cameron walks into the room.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWhat are you guys doing? I'm sure-- You 
ttsee this chemistry-

Cameron tries to hold up his book and Neil snatches it from his hands and
suddenly all three of them are racing around the room.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttHey, give me-- Neil, give me-- Don't be
ttimmature. Come on. I need my- 

Charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttGive it to me! Give it to me! 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttCharlie!

Neil tosses Cameron's book to Charlie.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttLet me have my book, I need my- 

The four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters, tossing
Cameron's book back and forth. Neil picks up a recorder and begins
blowing erratic notes on it while Charlie starts pounding on a set of
bongo drums. Outside the room a crowd of boys watch.

<b>EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE - DAY
</b>
Knox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance. Seeing no
one nearby, he races through the open gates and down the road. He comes
to the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass, shouting
as he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air.

<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
A number of vehicles drive up, filled with students dressed in bright red
cosyumes, playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass.
Knox watches the growing crowd of students. They are all converging on
a bus. A football player, wearing a horned helmet, dances on the roof of
the bus. A band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising.
Knox spots Chris amongst the cheerleaders. He watches her until Chet
comes along and she grabs hold of his hand. Knox looks away in disgust.

<b>ttttCOACH
</b>ttOkay, everybody on the bus. Let's go, 
ttboys. Come on, let's go. On the bus, 
ttboys. Now!

Chris jumps into Chet's arms as everyone begins to board the buses. Knox
turns his bike around and leaves.

<b>EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY
</b>
Keating walks across the field, followed by his students. He kicks a ball
ahead of him while he carries a number of other balls in a net slung over
his shoulder.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNow, devotees may argue that one sport 
ttor game is inherently better than 
ttanother. For me, sport is actually a 
ttchance for us to have other human beings 
ttpush us to excel. I want you all to come 
ttover here and take a slip of paper and 
ttline up single file.

Keating reaches the stands. He tosses the balls aside and pulls sets
his briefcase down. As the boys line up he begins ripping off slips
of paper from a notepad and handing them out.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttMr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth. 
ttMr. Pitts, rise above your name.

He hands the notepad to another student.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttI want you to hand these out to the boys,
ttone apiece.

<b>EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY
</b>
The students are all lined up in single file, each holding a slip
of paper. Keating blows his whistle.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttYou know what to do, Pitts. 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>tt"Oh to struggle against great odds. To 
ttmeet enemies undaunted."

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>tt"Oh to struggle against great odds. To

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNow go on.

Pitts gives one of the soccer balls a good kick.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttYes! Next.

One of the students sets up the next ball as the line advances.

<b>ttttBOY 1
</b>tt"To be a sailor of the world, bound for 
ttall ports." 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNext. Louder! 

<b>ttttBOY 2
</b>tt"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not 
tta slave." 

Keating walks away and starts up a record player.

<b>ttttBOY 3
</b>tt"To mount the scaffolds. To advance to 
ttthe muzzle of guns with perfect 
ttnonchalance."

Classical music begins playing on the phonograph. Meeks goes to
read next but is confused by the music.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttCome on, Meeks! Listen to the music. 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>tt"To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout,

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttYes! 

<b>ttttHOPKINS
</b>tttt(without energy)
tt"Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of 
ttnew joys." 

Hopkins crumples up his paper and then barely taps the soccer
ball with his foot.

Keating puts a look of disgust on his face.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttOh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill 
ttyour soul! 

Charlie raises his hands over his head.

<b>ttttCHARLIE

Neil is racing down the hallway, all excited.

</b>ttCharlie, I got the part! I'm gonna play 
ttPuck! I'm gonna play Puck!

He pounds on Charlie's door.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttNeil, how are you gonna do this? 

<b>ttttNEIL

</b>ttjust knowing that she's alive.

Knox crumples his poem and walks back to his desk.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttSorry, Captain. It's stupid. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNo, no. It's not stupid. It's a good 
tteffort. It touched on one of the major 
ttthemes, love. A major theme not only in 
ttpoetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were

Hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfolds
his piece of paper.

<b>ttttHOPKINS
</b>tt"The cat sat on the mat." 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttCongratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is 
ttthe first poem to ever have a negative 
ttscore on the Pritchard scale. We're not 
ttlaughing at you, we're laughing near 
ttyou. I don't mind that your poem had a 
ttsimple theme. Sometimes the most 
ttbeautiful poetry can be about simple 
ttthings, like a cat, or a flower or rain. 
ttYou see, poetry can come from anything 
ttwith the stuff of revelation in it. Just

Keating approaches Todd's desk.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttMr. Anderson thinks that everything

ttIsn't that your worst fear? Well, I

Keating walks up to the blackboard and begins to write.

</b>tt"I sound my barbaric yawp over the

Todd reluctantly stands and follows Keating to the front.

</b>ttNow, you don't get away that easy.

Keating turns Todd around and points out a picture on the wall.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThe picture of Uncle Walt up there. What

Keating begins to circle around Todd.

Keating puts his hands over Todd's eyes and they begin to slowly
spin around.

</b>ttUh, I-I close my eyes. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttYes?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttA sweaty-toothed madman with a stare 
ttthat pounds my brain. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttOh, that's excellent. Now, give him 
ttaction. Make him do something. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttH-His hands reach out and choke me. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThat's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.

Keating removes his hands from Todd but Todd keeps his eyes
closed.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttAnd, and all the time he's mumbling. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttWhat's he mumbling? 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttM-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like 
tta blanket that always leaves your feet 
ttcold." 

The students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keating
quickly gestures for him to close them again.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttForget them, forget them. Stay with the 
ttblanket. Tell me about that blanket. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttY-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll 
ttnever be enough. You kick at it, beat 
ttit, it'll never cover any of us. From 
ttthe moment we enter crying to the moment 
ttwe leave dying, it will just cover your 
ttface as you wail and cry and scream. 

Todd opens his eyes. The class is silent. Then they begin to clap
and cheer.

</b>ttt   (whispering to Todd)
ttDon't you forget this.

<b>EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY
</b>
Keating's students are playing a soccer game. After they score the
winning goal they hoist Keating onto their shoulders and carry him
away.

<b>INT. CAVE - DAY
</b>
The boys are all sitting around the cave lighting their pipes.
<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAttaboy, Pittsie, inhale deeply. 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttMy dad collects a lot of pipes. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttReally? Mine's got thirty. 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttYour parents collect pipes? Oh, that's 
ttreally interesting. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCome on, Knox. Join in. 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttYeah, Knox, we're from the government. 
ttWe're here to help, man. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat's wrong? 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttIt's Chris. Here's a picture of Chris 
ttfor you.

Pitts holds up a centerfold.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttSmoke that. Put that in your pipe and 
ttsmoke it. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttThat's not funny. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttKnock it off. Smoke your pipes. 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttNeil!

Neil enters the cave carrying a beat up light stand.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttFriend, scholar, Welton men. 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttWhat is that, Neil? 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttDuh. It's a lamp, Meeks.

Neil removes the shade from the lamp, revealing the shape of a man
as the base of the lamp.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNo. This is the god of the cave. 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttThe god of the cave.

Charlie begins making loud noises with his saxophone.

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttCharlie, what are you doing? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat do you say we start this meeting? 

<b>ttttBOY 1
</b>ttY-Yeah, just-- I need a light. I just 
ttgotta- 

<b>ttttBOY 2
</b>ttGot my earplugs?

Charlie stands up and clears his throat.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttGentlemen, "Poetrusic" by Charles 
ttDalton.

Charlie begins playing erratic notes on the sexophone.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttOh, no. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttLaughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling. 
ttGotta do more. Gotta be more. 

Charlie plays more erratic sounds.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttChaos screaming, chaos dreaming. Gotta 
ttdo more! Gotta be more!

Charlie starts to play a real tune on the saxophone.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttWow! 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttThat was nice. That was great. Where did 
ttyou learn to play like that? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttMy parents made me take the clarinet for 
ttyears. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttI love the clarinet. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI hated it. The saxophone. The saxophone 
ttis more sonorous. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttOoh. 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttVocabulary. 

Knox jumps up.
<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttI can't take it anymore. If I don't have 
ttChris, I'm gonna kill myself. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttKnoxious, you've gotta calm down. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttNo, Charlie. That's just my problem. 
ttI've been calm all my life. I'll do 
ttsomething about that. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWhere are you going? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat are you gonna do? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttI'm gonna call her.

Knox begins to chuckle as he leaves the cave. The others
quickly grab their coats to follow him. Charlie goes back to
playing noise on his saxophone again.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Knox is making a call from the payphone.

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttHello?

Knox immediately hangs up and looks at the other boys who are
all gathered around him.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttShe's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will 
tthate me. My parents will kill me. 
ttAll right, goddamn it. You're right. 
tt"Carpe diem." Even if it kills me. 

Knox puts in another coin and calls again.

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttHello? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttHello, Chris? 

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttYes. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttHi. This is Knox Overstreet. 

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttOh, yes. Knox. Glad you called. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttShe's glad I called. 

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttListen, Chet's parents are going out of 
tttown this weekend, so he's having a 
ttparty. Would you like to come? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttWould I like to come to a party? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYes. Say, yes. 

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttFriday? Um- 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttWell, sure. 

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttAbout seven? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttOkay, great. I-I'll be there, Chris. 

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttOkay. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttFriday night at the Danburrys'. O-Okay. 
ttThank you. 

<b>ttttCHRIS (O.S.)
</b>ttOkay. Bye. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttThank you. I'll see you. Bye. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYawp! Can you believe it? She was gonna

tther. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAt Chet Danburry's house. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYeah. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttSo? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttSo, you don't really think she means 
ttyou're going with her? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttWell, of course not, Charlie. But that's 
ttnot the point. That's not the point at 
ttall. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat is the point? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttThe point, Charlie, is, uh-- 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttthat she was thinking about me. I've 
ttonly met her once, and already she's 
ttthinking about me. Damn it. It's gonna 
tthappen, guys. I feel it. She is going to 
ttbe mine. Carpe. Carpe!

Knox flips his scarf dramatically around his neck as he walks away
and climbs the stairs.

<b>EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
</b>
The students are standing in a line while Cameron, Pitts, and Knox
are walking in a circle. Keating watches as they go around.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNo grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take 
tta stroll.

After a few moments, the three boys begin to march to the same beat.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThere it is. 

The other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttI don't know, but I've been told-- 

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>ttI don't know, but I've been told-- 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttDoing poetry is old-- 

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>ttDoing poetry is old-- 

Mr. Nolan looks out at them from his office as Keating joins the
boys and begins marching with them.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttLeft, left, left-right-left. Left, left, 
ttleft-right-left. Left, halt! 

The boys come to a halt.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThank you, gentlemen. If you noticed, 
tteveryone started off with their own 
ttstride, their own pace.

Keating begins walking very slowly.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttMr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll
ttget there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could
ttsee him thinking, "Is this right? It might
ttbe right. It might be right. I know that. 
ttMaybe not. I don't know."

Keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttMr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force.
ttYes. We know that. All right. Now, I
ttdidn't bring them up here to ridicule
ttthem. I brought them up here to illustrate
ttthe point of conformity: the difficulty in 
ttmaintaining your own beliefs in the face 
ttof others. Now, those of you -- I see 
ttthe look in your eyes like, "I would've 
ttwalked differently." Well, ask 
ttyourselves why you were clapping. Now, 
ttwe all have a great need for acceptance. 
ttBut you must trust that your beliefs are 
ttunique, your own, even though others may 
ttthink them odd or unpopular, even though 
ttthe herd may go, "That's baaaaad." Robert 
ttFrost said, "Two roads diverged in a 
ttwood and I, I took the one less traveled 
ttby, and that has made all the 
ttdifference." Now, I want you to find 
ttyour own walk right now. Your own way of 
ttstriding, pacing. Any direction. 
ttAnything you want. Whether it's proud, 
ttwhether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, 
ttthe courtyard is yours.

The students begin walking about, some walking casually, others
making up silly walks. Keating notices that Charlie is still
leaning up against one of the pillars.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttYou don't have to perform. Just make it 
ttfor yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining 
ttus? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttExercising the right not to walk. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThank you, Mr. Dalton. You just 
ttillustrated the point. Swim against the 
ttstream.

Nolan moves away from the window where he had been watching them.

<b>EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT
</b>
Neil is walking by with the notes for the play when he notices Todd
sitting off by himself on one of the walkways.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttTodd? Hey. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttHey. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWhat's going on?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttNothing. Today's my birthday. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttIs today your birthday? Happy birthday. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttThanks. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWhat's you get? 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttMy parents gave me this. 

Neil looks down at a deskset sitting next to Todd, still in
its wrappings.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttIsn't this the same desk set- 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttYeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing 
ttas last year. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttOh. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttOh. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>tttt (laughing)
ttMaybe they thought you needed another 
ttone. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttMaybe they weren't thinking about 
ttanything at all. Uh, the funny thing is 
ttabout this is I, I didn't even like it 
ttthe first time. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttTodd, I think you're underestimating the 
ttvalue of this desk set.

Neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI mean, who would want a football or
tta baseball, or-

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttOr a car. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttOr a car if they could have a desk set 
ttas wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if 
ttI were ever going to buy a, a desk set 
tttwice, I would probably buy this one 
ttboth times. In fact, its, its shape is, 
ttit's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can 
ttfeel it. This desk set wants to fly.

Neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. Todd stands up
and Neil hands him the desk set.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttTodd? The world's first unmanned flying 
ttdesk set.

Todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and it
falls to pieces down below.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttOh, my! 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttWell, I wouldn't worry. You'll get 
ttanother one next year.

<b>INT. CAVE - NIGHT
</b>
All the boys but Knox and Charlie are gathered in the cave.

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>tt"To live deep and suck out all the 
ttmarrow of life. To put to rout all that 
ttwas not life"

The boys stop as they hear the sound of female laughter outside.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttOh, my God! 

<b>ttttGLORIA
</b>ttIs this it? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah, this is it. Go ahead, go on in. 
ttIt's my cave. Watch your step. 

<b>ttttTINA
</b>ttWe're not gonna slip, are we? 

<b>ttttGLORIA
</b>ttUh-oh.

Gloria hops into the cave wearing a bright red shirt. The lights from
the boys' flashlights play conspicously over Gloria's chest. Tina
enters right behind her.

<b>ttttGLORIA
</b>ttHi.

Meeks stands up and slams his head into the low ceiling.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttHello. 

<b>ttttGLORIA
</b>ttHello. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHi, you guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and--

</b>ttHi. Hi. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttGuys, move. Move. Come on, folks. It's

The boys move aside to let the girls in.

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>ttSorry. Excuse- Excuse me. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttGuys, I have an announcement to make. In 
ttkeeping with the spirit of passionate

ttnow on, call me Nuwanda. 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>tttt(laughing)
ttNuwanda? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNuwanda? 

Tina takes out a tube of red lipstick. Charlie takes it from her
and puts red marks on each of his cheeks.

<b>INT. CHET'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Knox enters the house and looks anxiously about.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttHello? Hello, Chris?

Knox stops and combs his hair in the hallway mirror. Chris comes
running out from one of the rooms.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttKnox! 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttHi. 

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttYou made it. Great! Bring anybody? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttNo. 

Chris grabs Knox by his jackets and pulls him forward as she walks
toward the stairs.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttNo. Ginny Danburry's here. Wait. I have 
ttto go find Chet. Why don't you go 
ttdownstairs where everybody is?

Chris runs up the stairs as Knox stares after her.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttMake yourself at home. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttBut I--

<b>INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Knox stares at a couple kissing passionately. Across the room he sees
Chet and Chris dancing. He walks away.

<b>INT. CHET'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Knox enters the kitchen, walking between several football players
to fill up a mug of beer from a keg.

<b>ttttSTEVE
</b>ttHey, you Mutt Sanders' brother? Bubba, 
ttthis guy look like Mutt Sanders to you 
ttor what? 

Bubba spits ice cubes into the sink.

<b>ttttBUBBA
</b>ttYou're his brother? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttNo relation. Never heard of him. Sorry, 
ttguys. 

<b>ttttBUBBA
</b>ttt  (obviously drunk)
ttWhere's your manners Steve? Mutt Sanders' 
ttbrother, we don't even offer him a 
ttdrink. Here. Go have some whiskey, pal. 

Bubba hands Knox a glass and fills it up.

<b>ttttSTEVE
</b>ttYeah. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttWhoa, I, uh, I don't really drink-- 

<b>ttttBUBBA
</b>ttTo Mutt. 

<b>ttttSTEVE
</b>ttTo Mutt.

The two guys raise their glasses in a toast and Knox reluctantly
joins them.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttTo Mutt.

They each take a big drink. Knox rolls his eyes and gasps,
loosening his tie to try and breathe.

<b>ttttBUBBA
</b>ttNow, how the hell is old Mutt, anyway? 

<b>ttttSTEVE
</b>ttYeah. What's ol' Mutter been up to, huh? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttI don't really know Mutt. 

<b>ttttBUBBA
</b>ttTo Mighty Mutt. 

<b>ttttGUY 1
</b>ttTo Mighty Mutt. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttTo Mighty Mutt.

They raise their glasses again for a toast and down the rest
of their glasses.

<b>ttttBUBBA
</b>ttWell, listen, I gotta go find Patsy. Say 
tthello to Mutt for me, okay? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttWill do.

Bubba puts on a horned football helmet and walks away.

<b>ttttSTEVE
</b>ttYeah. Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt.

<b>INT. CAVE - NIGHT
</b>
<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWe gonna have a meeting or what? 

<b>ttttGLORIA
</b>ttYeah. If you guys don't have a meeting, 
tthow do we know if we wanna join? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttJoin? 

Charlie leans over to Tina.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? 
ttThou art more lovely and more 
tttemperate." 

<b>ttttTINA
</b>ttThat's so sweet. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI made that up just for you. 

<b>ttttTINA
</b>ttYou did?

The boys laugh and Cameron shakes his head. Charlie moves over
to sit next to Gloria.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'll write one for you too, Gloria. 
ttShe walks in beauty like the night. 
ttShe walks in beauty like the night. 
ttOf cloudless climes and starry skies. 
ttAll that's best, dark and bright, 
ttMeet in her aspect and her eyes. 

<b>ttttGLORIA
</b>ttThat's beautiful. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThere's plenty more where that came 
ttfrom.

<b>INT. CHET'S BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
The room is whirling as Knox belches and staggers across the room. He
passes Chet and several of his friends. He steps over several couples
kissing on the floor and slump down on the couch, only to be crowded
in by another couple who seem oblivious to him. He is about to get up
again when he notices Chris sleeping next to him on the couch.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttGod help me.

Knox looks about and then looks back down at Chris.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttCarpe diem.

Knox takes a last swig of his drink  and then begins to softly run his
fingers over Chris' hair. He then leans over and kisses her forehead.
Across the room, Bubba looks over and sees what's going on.

<b>ttttBUBBA
</b>ttChet! Chet! Look! 

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttWhat? 

<b>ttttBUBBA
</b>ttIt's Mutt Sanders' brother. 

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttHuh? 

Chris rises up from the couch and looks at Knox in surprise.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttKnox, what-- 

<b>ttttBUBBA
</b>ttAnd he's feeling up your girl! 

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttWhat are you doing? 

Chet gets up from his chair.

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttWhat the hell are you doing? 

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttChet! Chet, don't. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttNow, Chet, I know this looks bad, but 
ttyou've gotta-

Chet throws himself at Knox, hurling them both to the floor. He
then straddles Knox and begins to punch at him as Knox simply
tries to protect himself.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttChet, no! You'll hurt him! No! No! Stop 
ttit! Leave him alone! 

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttGoddamn! 

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttChet, stop it!

Chris manages to haul Chet away from Knox.

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttBastard!

Knox takes his hands away from his face and feels at his bloody
nose. Chris tries to help him up.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttKnox, are you all right? 

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttChris, get the hell away from him! 

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttChet, you hurt him! 

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttGood! 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttI'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttIt's okay. It-It's okay.

Chet hauls Chris away from Knox and then points at him.

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttNext time I see you, you die. 

<b>INT. CAVE - NIGHT
</b>
Tina passes a bottle of alcohol to Neil.

<b>ttttTINA
</b>ttGo ahead, pass it around. 

Cameron motions for Neil not to take it but Neil takes a swig anyway.
There is a moment of awkward silence.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttMe and Pitts are working on a hi-fi 
ttsystem. It shouldn't be that hard to, 
ttuh, to put together. 

<b>ttttPITTS

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhy? Nobody knows who we are. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWell, don't you think they're gonna

ttno right to do something like that. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt's Nuwanda, Cameron.

</b>ttIn this week of Welton's Honor there 
ttappeared a profane and unauthorized 
ttarticle. Rather than spend my valuable 
tttime ferreting out the guilty persons -- 
ttand let me assure you I will find them -
tt- I'm asking any and all students who 
ttknows anything about this article to 
ttmake themselves known here and now. 
ttWhoever the guilty persons are, this is 
ttyour only chance to avoid expulsion from 
ttthis school.

The sound of a phone ringing can be heard. The professors look
about for its source. Charlie picks up a telephone receiver.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWelton Academy. Hello. Yes, he is. Just 
tta moment.

Charlie stands up, holding a phone and bell in his hands.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttMr. Nolan, it's for you. It's 
ttGod. He says we should have girls at 
ttWelton.

Most of the students laugh while the boys from the cave all shake
their heads in disbelief.

<b>INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Charlie stands with his back to the door as Mr. Nolan shuts it. Mr. 
Nolan then walks around to face Charlie.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttWipe that smirk off your face. If you 
ttthink, Mr. Dalton, that you're the first 
ttto try to get thrown out of this school, 
ttthink again. Others have had similar 
ttnotions and have failed just as surely 
ttas you will fail. Assume the position.

Charlie sighs and bends over, resting his hands on the desk. Mr.
Nolan hefts a flat wooden paddle in his hands.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttCount aloud, Mr. Dalton.

Mr. Nolan begins to strike Charlie with the paddle.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOne. Two. Three. Four. Five. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttWhat is this Dead Poets Society? I want 
ttnames.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
A crowd of students is gathered about as Charlie stiffly walks back to his room.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYou kicked out? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNo. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttSo what happened? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm to turn everybody in, apologize to 
ttthe school and all will be forgiven. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttSo, what are you gonna do? Charlie! 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDamn it, Neil. The name is Nuwanda.

Charlie smiles and then shuts his door.

<b>INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Keating and McAllister are enjoying tea in the small room off the
classroom. Mr. Nolan knocks on the door and enters.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttExcuse me. May we have a word, Mr. 
ttKeating? 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttCertainly.

Keating fixes his tie and follows Mr. Nolan into the classroom.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttThis was my first classroom, John. Did 
ttyou know that? My first desk. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttDidn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttEnglish. Oh, long before your time. It 
ttwas hard giving it up, I can tell you. 
ttI'm hearing rumors, John, about some 
ttunorthodox teaching methods in your 
ttclassroom. I'm not saying they've 
ttanything to do with the Dalton boy's 
ttoutburst. But I don't think I have to 
ttwarn you boys his age are very 
ttimpressionable. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttWell, your reprimand made quite an 
ttimpression, I'm sure. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttWhat was going on in the courtyard the 
ttother day? 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttCourtyard? 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttYeah. Boys marching, clapping in unison. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttOh, that. That was an exercise to prove 
tta point. Dangers of conformity. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttWell, John, the curriculum here is set. 
ttIt's proven it works. If you question, 
ttwhat's to prevent them from doing the 
ttsame? 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttI always thought the idea of educating 
ttwas to learn to think for yourself. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttAt these boys' ages? Not on your life! 
ttTradition, John. Discipline. Prepare 
ttthem for college, and the rest will take 
ttcare of itself.

<b>INT. STUDY ROOM - DAY
</b>
Charlie sits with his bongos as the other boys are all crowded
around him. He hits the bongoes as he mimes Nolan's footsteps.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCreak. He started walking around towards 
ttmy left. Creak. Creak. "Assume the 
ttposition, Mr. Dalton."

The door opens and Keating walks in. Many of the boys get up from
their seats.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttIt's all right, gentlemen. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttMr. Keating. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttMr. Dalton. That was a pretty lame stunt 
ttyou pulled today. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou're siding with Mr. Nolan? What about 
ttCarpe diem and sucking all the marrow 
ttout of life and all that? 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttSucking the marrow out of life doesn't 
ttmean choking on the bone. Sure there's a 
tttime for daring and there's a time for 
ttcaution, and a wise man understands 
ttwhich is called for. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBut I thought you'd like that. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNo. You being expelled from school is 
ttnot daring to me. It's stupid, 'cause 
ttyou'll miss some golden opportunities. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah. Like what? 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttLike, if nothing else, the opportunity 
ttto attend my classes. Got it, Ace? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAye, aye, Captain. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttKeep your head about you. That goes for 
ttthe lot of you. 

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>ttYes, Captain. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttPhone call from God. If it had been

Keating leaves and the boys gather around Charlie once again.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAll right. Go on.

Neil bikes away as the clock bell tolls.

<b>INT. THEATER - DAY
</b>
Neil walks into the back of the theater and watches various
actors rehearsing on stage. A smile fills his face.

</b>ttWe're trying to rehearse, okay? Start. 

<b>ttttLYSANDER
</b>ttA good persuasion, therefore hear me, 
ttHermia.

The bell rings and students rush down the hall.

</b>ttSpaghetti and meatballs!

Neil comes up the stairs as everyone else swarms down to the cafeteria.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttSave some for me. "But, room, Fairy! 
ttHere comes Oberon."

Neil opens the door to his room and sees his father sitting at his desk.

</b>ttFather.

Mr. Perry rises from the desk.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttDon't you dare talk back to me! It's bad 
ttenough that you've wasted your time with 
ttthis, this absurd acting business. But 
ttyou deliberately deceived me! How, how, 
tthow did you expect to get away with 
ttthis? Answer me. Who put you up to it? 
ttWas it this new man? This, uh, Mr. 
ttKeating? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNo. Nobody-- I thought I'd surprise you. 
ttI've gotten all A's in every class. 

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttDid you think I wasn't going to find 
ttout? "Oh, my niece is in a play with 
ttyour son," says Mrs. Marks. "No, no, 
ttno," I say, "you must be mistaken. My 
ttson's not in a play." You made me a liar 
ttof me, Neil! Now, tomorrow you go to 
ttthem and you tell them that you're 
ttquitting. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNo, I can't. I have the main part. The 
ttperformance is tomorrow night. 

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttI don't care if the world comes to an

ttthat play. Is that clear? Is that clear? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYes, sir. 

Mr. Perry goes to leave and then turns around.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY

<b>INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
Keating is seated at his desk. He is writing a letter and occasionally
looks up at the framed photo on his desk of a woman playing the cello.
There is a knock at the door.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttIt's open.

Neil enters and closes the door behind him. He appears to be nervous.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNeil, what's up? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttCan I speak to you a minute? 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttCertainly. Sit down.

Neil goes to take a seat but notices the chair is piled up with books.
Neil picks them up and Keating gets up from his seat to help him.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI'm sorry. Here. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttExcuse me. Get you some tea? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttTea. Sure.

Keating goes to a table in the corner and begins pouring several cups.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttLike some milk or sugar in that? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNo, thanks. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttGosh, they don't give you much room 
ttaround here. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNo, it's part of the monastic oath. They 
ttdon't want worldly things distracting me 
ttfrom my teaching.

Keating gives Neil a cup of tea and they return to their seats. Neil
looks at the photo on the desk.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttShe's pretty. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttShe's also in London. Makes it a little 
ttdifficult. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttHow can you stand it? 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttStand what? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttYou can go anywhere. You can do 
ttanything. How can you stand being here? 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>tt'Cause I love teaching. I don't wanna be 
ttanywhere else. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttWhat's up? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI just talked to my father. He's making 
ttme quit the play at Henley Hall. 
ttActing's everything to me. I-- But he 
ttdoesn't know. He-- I can see his point. 
ttWe're not a rich family like Charlie's, 
ttand we-- But he's planning the rest of

ttasked me what I want.

</b>ttI can't. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttWhy not? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI can't talk to him this way. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttThen you're acting for him, too. You're 
ttplaying the part of the dutiful son. I 
ttknow this sounds impossible, but you 
tthave to talk to him. You have to show 
tthim who you are, what your heart is. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI know what he'll say. He'll tell me 
ttthat acting's a whim, and I should 
ttforget it. That how they're counting on 
ttme. He'll just tell me to put it out of 
ttmy mind, "for my own good." 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttYou are not an indentured servant. If 
ttit's not a whim for you, you prove it to 
tthim by your conviction and your passion. 
ttYou show him that And if he still 
ttdoesn't believe you, well, by then 
ttyou'll be out of school and you can do 
ttanything you want. 

A tear falls down Neil's cheek and he wipes it away.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNo. What about the play? The show's 
tttomorrow night. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttWell, you have to talk to him before

</b>ttNo, you're not.

<b>EXT. CAMPUS - DAY
</b>
Knox exits one of the doors. The ground is covered with a thick
layer of snow. He looks around to see if anyone is about and then
hurries over to the bike rack. grabbing one of the bikes, he hurries
off.

<b>INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
A crowd of students come in from the cold. Knox pushes his way through
them, carrying a handful of wildflowers. He begins searching for Chris.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttChris!

He approaches a girl with hair similar to Chris' and turns her around,
only to realize that it's not her.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttChris Noel. Do you know where she is? 

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttUm, I think she's in room 111.

The girl points down the hallway and Knox sets off in that direction.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttThanks.

Chris is at her locker talking to a friend. She just closes her locker
as she notices Knox coming towards her. She turns away.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttExcuse me. Chris. 

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttKnox, what are you doing here? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttI came to apologize for the other night. 
ttI brought you these and a poem I wrote 
ttfor you.

Chris pulls him aside, out of the main hallway.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttKnox, don't you know that, if Chet finds 
ttyou here he'll kill you? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttI can't care. I love you, Chris.

</b>ttKnox, you're crazy. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttLook, I acted like a jerk and I know it. 
ttPlease, accept these. Please. 

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttNo. No-- I, I can't. Forget it.

Chris walks away. The school bell rings and she enters her
classroom, closing the door behind her. Undaunted, Knox follows,
opening the door and standing before her desk.

<b>ttttCHRIS
</b>ttKnox, I don't believe this. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttAll I'm asking you to do is listen.

As Knox begins to read his poem, the classroom grows quiet as
everyone stops to listen.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttThe heavens made a girl named Chris 
ttWith hair and skin of gold. 
ttTo touch her would be paradise.

Chris holds her head in her hands in embarrassment.

<b>INT. CAMPUS KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Knox sneaks in through a side door. He snatches a slice of toast
from the counter and motions to one of the staff to keep secret.
He then begins to eat the toast as he hurries away.

<b>INT. STAIRWAY - DAY
</b>
The school bell rings and Knox pushes his way up the stairs past
the slower students. At the top he joins the other boys where they
are grabbing their books.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttGet out of here. Cameron, you fool.

Charlie notices Knox and grabs his jacket.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHey, how'd it go? Did you read it to
tther? 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYeah.

The boys begin to get all excited but Charlie shushes them.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttNothing. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNothing. What do you mean, nothing?

</b>ttNothing. But I did it.

Knox walks away down the hall and the others chase after him.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttUh, he didn't like it one bit, but at

</b>ttCome on, Todd. I'm trying to fix 
ttthis. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttCome on, Nuwanda. You're gonna miss

ttbefore we left. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttGetting red? What does that mean? 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttI, uh-- Well, you know Charlie.

One of the stalls opens and Charlie's hand emerges, holding a small
brush and a bottle of red paint.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttSo, Charlie, what's this "getting red" 
ttbit?

Charlie opens his unbuttoned shirt to show a large red lightning bolt
painted down his chest.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttW-What is that? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt's an Indian warrior symbol for

Knox leaves the other boys to join her.

Snow is lightly falling as Chris and Knox walk outside.

</b>ttIt's fine for you to come barging into 
ttmy school and make a complete fool out

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttI didn't mean to make a fool out of you.

Chris walks away from him and then turns to face him.

Chris gestures for Knox to follow her. Charlie does a little 
twirl as he joins her and puts his arm around her. They walk away.

<b>INT. THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
The audience is packed. The stage is set up to resemble a forest and
lights dance about it. From behind a bush, Neil emerges, wearing a
crown of twigs and berries and twigs on his hands. In the audience,
Charlie emerges from his seat, all excited.

</b>ttHey, there he is! Hey, hey.

Cameron shoves him back into his seat.

</b>ttShh, boys.

On stage, Neil hides behind a tree as a girl emerges, similarly clad,
but with flowers in her hair. Neil sneaks over to the girl.

ttHe's good. He's really good.

Keating gives a thumbs up.

The director breaks Neil out of his thoughts.

<b>ttttDIRECTOR
</b>ttNeil. That's your cue, Neil. Come on, 
ttNeil. Here's your crown. Let's go.

Neil reluctantly replaces his crown and follows her.

<b>INT. THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
On stage, Neil collects dew in a leaf and holds it over his head while
fairies dance about. In the audience, Knox takes Chris' hand in his.

<b>INT. THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
The stage is dark. A spotlight comes on to reveal Neil with his back to
the audience. He slowly turns around to face the audience and his father.

<b>ttttPUCK
</b>
ttIf we shadows have offended,

Neil directs his eyes at his father, who stills stands at the back
of the theater.

<b>ttttPUCK
</b>ttThink but this, and all is mended, 
ttThat you have but slumber'd here 
ttWhile these visions did appear. 
ttAnd this weak and idle theme, 
ttNo more yielding but a dream, 
ttGentles, do not reprehend: 
ttIf you pardon, we will mend: 
ttAnd, as I am an honest Puck, 
ttIf we have unearned luck 
ttNow to 'scape the serpent's tongue, 
ttWe will make amends ere long; 
ttElse the Puck a liar call; 
ttSo, good night unto you all. 
ttGive me your hands, if we be friends, 
ttAnd Robin shall restore amends.

Neil backs away and the curtains close as the audience begins to
applaud enthusiastically. Behind the curtain numerous people
congratulate Neil as they line up for the curtain call. The curtains
open. Charlie and the other boys rise to their feet, followed quickly
by the rest of the audience. The actors bow to continued applause. The
actors push Neil forward and he takes a second bow.

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>ttYawp! 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYeah, Neil!

The curtain closes again and Neil turns around, letting out an
excited sigh. Various actors continue to congratulate him. Neil
lets out a yell as he walks offstage. In the audience, while others
are leaving, Mr. Perry approaches a woman.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttExcuse me, I'm Neil's father. I need to 
ttsee him.

Backstage, the woman approaches Neil.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttNeil, Your father. He's-

Neil nods in agreement.

<b>ttttACTOR
</b>ttWhat did you think?

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttReally I thought you were all just 
ttwonderful!

Neil emerges from the curtains, carrying his costume. The theater is
nearly empty now, except for Mr. Perry standing at the back. Neil
smiles at him but the smile quickly disappears.

<b>EXT. THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Perry pushes his way through the crowd of people, with Neil close
behind.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttExcuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

The boys notice Neil and try to dtop him to talk.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNeil, Neil, you were great. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI can't, guys. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttNeil! Neil!

Outside of the crowd, Keating manages to catch up to Neil. He takes
hold of Neil's coat.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttNeil. Neil. You have the gift. What a 
ttperformance You left even me speechless. 
ttYou have to stay with-

Mr. Perry returns from his car and shoves Neil aside.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttGet in the car. Keating, you stay away 
ttfrom my son. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNeil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttDon't make it any worse than it is.

Neil and Mr. Perry get into their car and drive away. Keating
stares after them.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIs it okay if we walk back? Captain?

Charlie motions Todd to follow.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttKnox.

The boys leave and Keating continues to stare after the car, wiping
the falling snow from his face.

<b>INT. MR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
A photo of Neil standing stiffly with his parents sits on a table
between a glass of alcohol and a half filled ashtray. Mrs. Perry
watches through the window as her husband and son arrive and then
takes a nervous puff on her cigarette before sitting down. Mr.
Perry walks in with Neil close behind him. Neil sits down beside the
desk while Mr. Perry remains standing.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttWe're trying very hard to understand why 
ttit is that you insist on defying us. 
ttWhatever the reason, we're not gonna let 
ttyou ruin your life. Tomorrow I'm 
ttwithdrawing you from Welton and 
ttenrolling you in Braden Military School. 
ttYou're going to Harvard and you're gonna 
ttbe a doctor. 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttBut that's ten more years. Father, 
ttthat's a lifetime! 

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttOh, stop it. Don't be so dramatic. You 
ttmake it sound like a prison term. You 
ttdon't understand, Neil. You have 
ttopportunities that I never even dreamt 
ttof and I am not going to let you waste 
ttthem.

Neil rises to his feet.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI've got to tell you what I feel.

Mrs. Perry stands up.

<b>ttttMRS. PERRY
</b>ttWe've been so worried about-- 

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttWhat? What? Tell me what you feel. What 
ttis it?

Neil looks to his mother and then back to his father but says
nothing.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttIs it more of this, this acting 
ttbusiness? Because you can forget that. 
ttWhat? 

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttNothing.

Neil sits back down dejectedly.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttNothing? Well, then, let's go to bed.

Mr. Perry leaves. Mrs. Perry pauses on her way out and kneels
behind Neil.

<b>ttttNEIL
</b>ttI was good. I was really good.

Mrs. Perry nods slightly.
<b>ttttMRS. PERRY
</b>ttGo on, get some sleep.

<b>INT. MR. PERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Mrs. Perry sits on the side of the bed with her back to her
husband. Mr. Perry removes his robe and slippers before
getting in to bed. Mrs. Perry begins to cry as he turns out
the light.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttIt's all right. It's going to be all 
ttright.

<b>INT. NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Neil's pyjamas, bathrobe, towel, and shaving kit are all neatly
laid out on his bed. Neil touches his pyjamas lightly and then
removes his coat and shirt. He walks over to the windows and
opens them, taking several deep breaths. He places the crown of
twigs on his head and then closes his eyes, slowly letting his head
fall to his chest.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
A door opens and Neil emerges, slowly walking down the stairs as if
in a trance.

<b>INT. MR. PERRY'S STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
Neil holds a key in his hands. He unlocks a drawer in his father's
desk and pulls out a pistol, wrapped in cloth.

<b>INT. MR. PERRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Mr. Perry jerks up out of bed, startled and breathing fast.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttWhat was that? 

<b>ttttMRS. PERRY
</b>ttWhat? 

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttThat sound. 

<b>ttttMRS. PERRY
</b>ttWhat sound? Tom?

Mr. Perry turns on the light and gets up out of bed, putting on his
robe and slippers.
<b>ttttMRS. PERRY
</b>ttWhat is it? What's wrong? 

Mr. Perry turns on the hallway light and knocks on Neil's door. He opens
the door and goes inside.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttNeil.

Mr. Perry notices the open window.

<b>ttttMRS. PERRY
</b>ttTom, what is it? What's wrong? Neil?

Mr. Perry continues to look through the house, continuing downstairs.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttNeil?

Mr. Perry notices the door to his study is ajar.

<b>ttttMRS. PERRY
</b>ttI'll look outside. Neil?

Mr. Perry flicks the light on but sees nothing. Then he smells
something. Looking closer, he sees a thin cloud of smoke rising from
behind his desk. As he moves around the desk he sees his gun on the
floor and Neil's outstretched hand.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttNo!

Mr. Perry crouches down by his son.

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttOh, Neil! Oh, my God!

Mrs. Perry enters the room and sees her son.

<b>ttttMRS. PERRY
</b>ttOh! No! 

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttOh, my son! 

<b>ttttMRS. PERRY
</b>ttHe's all right. 

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttMy son! My poor son! 

<b>ttttMRS. PERRY
</b>ttt    (crying hysterically)
ttHe's all right! He's all right! He's all 
ttright! He's all right! He's all right! 
ttHe's all right! 

<b>ttttMR. PERRY
</b>ttStop it! Stop it! Stop it.

Mr. Perry holds his wife and tries to comfort her.

<b>INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Todd is sleeping. Charlie reaches across to wake him. Tears are
running down his face.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttTodd? Todd.

Todd, still half asleep, tries to shrug him off.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttOh, Charlie.

Todd opens his eyes and sees Charlie's face

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttWhat is it?

Todd looks over to see Pitts, Meeks, and Knox by the door.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNeil's dead.

<b>EXT. CAMPUS - DAY
</b>
It is a snowy, overcast morning. Todd walks through the snow. He
has his coat on over his pyjamas. The other boys follow closely
behind him as he walks down towards the water. He stops and stares
out at the snow-covered surroundings.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttIt's so beautiful.

Todd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees, vomiting into
the snow. The other boys huddle around him, hugging him.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttTodd. It's okay, Todd. 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttCalm down. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt's all right, Todd. 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttTodd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt's all right. It's alright.

Charlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes Todd's mouth with it. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttHe wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it. 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttYou can't explain it, Todd. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttIt was his father! 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNo! 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttHe wouldn't have left us. It's because he-
ttHe wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his 
ttfather did it. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttTodd. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttHis father killed him. He made him do it.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttYou can't explain it, Todd.

Todd pushes himself away from the boys and stumbles down the hill,
slipping and falling in the snow.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttTodd! 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttLeave him be.

The boys watch as Todd runs down towards the dock by the river,
yelling and crying. He finally seems to regain control of himself
and walks in silence out onto the dock.

<b>INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Keating sits by himself at his desk. After a moment he gets up
and walks over to Neil's desk. Opening it, he finds his copy
of "Five Centuries of Verse" and flips through the first few pages.
Sitting down at the desk, he returns to the opening page, reading
the opening verse written there. Keating begins to sob, then closes
the book.

<b>INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY
</b>
A church service is going on. The boys have joined in the other
students in a hymn. Charlie is the only one not singing. He stares
off into nothingness.

<b>ttttBOYS
</b>tttt (singing)
ttAll my life 
ttThy light shall surely follow me 
ttAnd in God's house forevermore 
ttMy dwelling place shall be 
ttAmen.

Mr. Nolan stands at the pulpit, with the rest of the professors
seated behind him.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttThe death of Neil Perry is a tragedy. He 
ttwas a fine student. One of Welton's 
ttbest. And he will be missed. We've 
ttcontacted each of your parents to 
ttexplain the situation. Naturally, 
ttthey're all quite concerned. At the 
ttrequest of Neil's family, I intend to 
ttconduct a thorough inquiry into this 
ttmatter. Your complete cooperation is 
ttexpected.

<b>INT. CLOAKROOM - DAY
</b>
The boys (except Cameron) are sitting about the cluttered room
waiting. Charlie lights a cigarette.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou told him about this meeting? 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttTwice. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThat's it, guys. We're all fried. 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttHow do you mean? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCameron's a fink. He's in Nolan's office 
ttright now, finking. 

<b>ttttPITTS
</b>ttAbout what? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThe club, Pittsie. Think about it. The 
ttboard of directors, the trustees and Mr. 
ttNolan. Do you think for one moment 
ttthey're gonna let this thing just blow 
ttover? Schools go down because of things 
ttlike this. They need a scapegoat.

The door opens. All the boys except Charlie hurry to put
their cigarettes out and wave the smoke away. A light comes on
and Cameron enters.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWhat's going on, guys? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou finked, didn't you, Cameron?

Charlie gets up and approaches Cameron, tossing his cigarette away.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttFinked? I didn't know what the hell 
ttyou're talking about. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou told Nolan everything about the club 
ttis what I'm talking about. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttLook, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, 
ttthere's something called an honor code 
ttat this school, all right? If a teacher 
ttasks you a question, you tell the truth 
ttor you're expelled. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou little-

Charlie lunges at Cameron but Knox and Meeks hold him back.

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttCharlie! 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHe's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes, 
ttso he rattled to save himself. 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttDon't touch him, Charlie. You do and 
ttyou're out. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm out anyway! 

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttYou don't know that, not yet. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttHe's right there, Charlie. And if you 
ttguys are smart, you will do exactly what 
ttI did and cooperate. They're not after 
ttus. We're the victims. Us and Neil. 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat's that mean? Who are they after? 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWhy, Mr. Keating, of course. The 
tt"Captain" himself. I mean, you guys 
ttdidn't really think he could avoid 
ttresponsibility, did you? 

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttMr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is 
ttthat what they're saying? 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWell, who else do you think, dumb ass? 
ttThe administration? Mr. Perry? Mr. 
ttKeating put us up to all this crap, 
ttdidn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating, 
ttNeil would be cozied up in his room 
ttright now, studying his chemistry and 
ttdreaming of being called doctor. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttThat is not true, Cameron. You know 
ttthat. He didn't put us to anything. Neil 
ttloved acting. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttBelieve what you want, but I say let 
ttKeating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?

Charlie lunges at Cameron again and punches him in the face.
Cameron falls to the floor as the boys pull Charlie away. Cameron
lifts a hand to his bloody nose.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttYou just signed your expulsion papers, 
ttNuwanda.

Cameron rises to his feet.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttAnd if the rest of you are smart, you'll 
ttdo exactly what I did. They know 
tteverything anyway. You can't save 
ttKeating, but you can save yourselves.

Cameron walks away, closing the door behind him.

<b>INT. TODD'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
Todd looks out the window and watches as Hager escorts Meeks back
to the dorm. Inside the room, Neil's bed has been stripped of all
its bedding.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Meeks walks slowly to his room. Hager remains standing at the end of
the hallway.

<b>ttttHAGER
</b>ttKnox Overstreet.

Knox emerges from his room and goes to joing Hager. He gives a thumbs
up to Todd as he passes his door. Once he leaves with Hager, Todd goes
over to Meeks' door.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttMeeks? 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttGo away. I have to study. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttWhat happened to Nuwanda? 

<b>ttttMEEKS
</b>ttExpelled.

</b>ttTodd Anderson.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Todd is lead up the steps to Mr. Nolan's office by Hager.

<b>INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Todd enters the room to see his mother and father seated opposite
Mr. Nolan's desk.

<b>ttttMR. ANDERSON
</b>ttHello, son. 

<b>ttttMRS. ANDERSON
</b>ttHello, darling. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttMom.

THe door closes behind Todd. He remains standing, not knowing
what to do.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttHave a seat, Mr. Anderson.

Todd sits down next to his parents.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttMr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well 
ttput together what's happened here. You 
ttdo admit to being a part of this Dead 
ttPoets Society?

Todd says nothing.

<b>ttttMR. ANDERSON
</b>ttAnswer him, Todd. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttYes, sir.

Mr. Nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before him
before removing his glasses once more.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttI have here a detailed description of 
ttwhat occurred at your meetings. It 
ttdescribes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, 
ttencouraged you boys to organize this 
ttclub and to use it as a source of 
ttinspiration for reckless and self-
ttindulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. 
ttKeating, both in and out of the 
ttclassroom, encouraged Neil Perry to 
ttfollow his obsession with acting when he 
ttknew all along it was against the 
ttexplicit order of Neil's parents. It was 
ttMr. Keating's blatant abuse of his 
ttposition as teacher that led directly to 
ttNeil Perry's death. 

Mr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of
paper to Todd.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttRead that document carefully, Todd. Very 
ttcarefully.

Todd looks at the paper, which already contains the signatures of
the other four boys.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttIf you've nothing to add or amend, sign 
ttit. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttWhat's gonna happen to Mr. Keating? 

<b>ttttMR. ANDERSON
</b>ttI've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.

Mr. Nolan holds out a pen for Todd to take.

<b>EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Mr. McAllister leads his students, textbooks in hand, through the
snow outside the classrooms.

ttttMcALLISTER
ttGrass is gramen or herba. Lapis is 
ttstone. The entire building is 
ttaedificium.

Keating looks out from his office window. McAllister pauses and looks
up at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back.

<b>INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Keating laughs slightly as he watches McAllister from the window.
Inside, all his belongings have been packed up.

<b>INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
The students are all seated at their desks in silence. Everyone looks
as the door opens. They quickly stand as Mr. Nolan enters the room.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttSit.

The students sit once again as Mr. Nolan walks to the front of the room.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttI'll be teaching this class through 
ttexams. We'll find a permanent English 
ttteacher during the break. Who will tell

</b>ttIn the, in the, in the Pritchard? 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttKindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttWe skipped around a lot, sir. We covered 
ttthe Romantics and some of the chapters 
tton Post Civil War literature. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttWhat about the Realists? 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttI believe we skipped most of that, sir. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttAll right, then, we'll start over. What 
ttis poetry?

There is a knock at the classroom door.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttCome.

The students look back as the door opens. They quickly turn
away when hey see it is Keating.

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttExcuse me. I came for my personals. 
ttShould I come back after class? 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttGet them now, Mr. Keating. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttGentlemen, turn to page 21 of the 
ttintroduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud 
ttthe excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on 
tt"Understanding Poetry."

Todd slowly closes his book. Keating opens the door to the tiny
room off the classroom.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttThat page has been ripped out, sir. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttWell, borrow somebody else's book. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttThey're all ripped out, sir. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttWhat do you mean, they're all ripped 
ttout? 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>ttSir, we, uh- 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttNever mind.

Mr. Nolan takes his own book over to Cameron's desk and then
slaps the open page.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttRead!

As Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts
his scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away.

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>tt"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans 
ttPritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand 
ttpoetry, we must first be fluent with its 
ttmeter, rhyme and figures of speech, then 
ttask two questions: 1) How artfully has 
ttthe objective of the poem been rendered 
ttand 2)..."

The door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses. 

<b>ttttCAMERON
</b>tt"... How important is that objective? 
ttQuestion 1 rates the poem's perfection; 
ttquestion 2 rates its importance. And 
ttonce these questions have been answered, 
ttdetermining the poem's greatness becomes 
tta relatively simple matter. If the 
ttpoem's score for perfection is plotted 
tton the horizontal of a graph--"

Keating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the
classroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttMr. Keating! They made everybody sign 
ttit. 

Mr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttQuiet, Mr. Anderson. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttYou gotta believe me. It's true. 

<b>ttttKEATING
</b>ttI do believe you, Todd. 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttLeave, Mr. Keating. 

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttBut it wasn't his fault! 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttSit down, Mr. Anderson!

Todd reluctantly returns to his seat.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttOne more outburst from you or anyone
ttelse, and you're out of this school!
ttLeave, Mr. Keating.

Keating hesitates at the back of the classroom.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttI said leave, Mr. Keating.

Keating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens
it, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttO Captain! My Captain! 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttSit down, Mr. Anderson!

Keating pauses at the door and looks back at Todd on his desk.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttDo you hear me? Sit down! Sit down! This 
ttis your final warning, Anderson. How 
ttdare you? Do you hear me?

After a moment of indecision, Knox climbs up onto his desk.

<b>ttttKNOX
</b>ttO Captain! My Captain! 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttMr. Overstreet, I warn you! Sit down!

Pitts climbs up onto his desk, followed by several others,
including Meeks.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttSit down! Sit down. All of you. I want 
ttyou seated. Sit down. Leave, Mr. 
ttKeating.

More students stand on their desks until half the class is standing.

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttAll of you, down. I want you seated. Do 
ttyou hear me? 

<b>ttttMR. NOLAN
</b>ttSit down! 

Keating stands in the doorway, staring up at the boys in wonder. A
smile comes to his face.
