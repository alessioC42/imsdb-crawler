<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET
</b>
<b>CREDIT SEQUENCE:
</b>
The image is in black and white.

The sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant
shadows on the sea.

A little boy around 8 years old -- tanned from head to toe
-- sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to
another with amazing agility.

In one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag.  In the
other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and
sweater.

The only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit --
obvious hand-me-downs -- way too big.  He tugs on them as
he goes, holding them up... Until they slide again... as
he leaps again... and pulls them up...

The little boy is JACQUES MAYOL.

End credits.


<b>EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET
</b>
JACQUES reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove.

He spits in his mask... expertly spreads the spit with a
finger... locks his feet into the flippers... and dives.

He surfaces a long way out... adjusts his mask... and
swims away from shore.


<b>IN OPEN SEA
</b>
The boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -- sucks it
in -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid
breaths -- almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if
we've never seen this before.

His gaze is glued to the ocean floor.  Clear clear water.
40 feet deep.  And intensely blue.

Suddenly, he catches his breath and dives -- into the
blue.


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
JACQUES touches bottom.  Clamps his legs around a rock to
hold himself down.  Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet
under... he opens the plastic bag.  A huge speckled moray
eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him.
The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head.

The boy smiles at him.  Pulls a piece of raw meat out of
his bag and holds it out.  The eel takes the morsel
delicately -- and slithers back into his hole.

Gravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag.


<b>EXT.  VILLAGE - DUSK
</b>
JACQUES walks up a steep road bordering the port, almost
dry now.

Two boys about his age run up the streets; call out, catch
up with him and gesture toward the port.

<b>tttttTHE BOYS
</b>ttJacques!  Come quick!


<b>EXT.  PIER - DUSK
</b>
The little boys tug JACQUES to the end of the pier and
point to something in the water.

<b>tttttBOYS
</b>ttLook!  Right there!  It's shining!

JACQUES walks over, and sure enough sees something shining
a few feet down in the water.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (squinting)
ttA coin.

<b>tttttFIRST BOY
</b>ttI found it.

<b>tttttSECOND BOY
</b>ttLiar!

Camera pans and we see a middle-aged PRIEST loading
supplies into a small boat.  He stops to watch the
children's negotiations.  Little JACQUES is putting his
flippers on.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttOk.  I'll get it, but no fighting,
ttall right?

The two boys nod as they point to the coin.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWe'll split it.

<b>tttttFIRST BOY
</b>ttYou can't split a coin.  That's
ttstupid.

<b>tttttSECOND BOY
</b>ttHe's right.  You're stupid.

The pope smiles.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttThen we'll buy something and split
ttthat.

<b>tttttSECOND BOY
</b>ttA helicopter...

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttIt's a small coin.

<b>tttttFIRST BOY
</b>ttA Ferrari.

<b>tttttSECOND BOY
</b>ttI don't want a Ferrari... What is
ttit?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (interrupting them)
ttMaybe a little radio.

The two boys look at each other.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWell.  We'll decide later.  The light
ttis going.

<b>tttttSECOND BOY
</b>ttI get the radio from after school,
ttuntil midnight.

<b>tttttFIRST BOY
</b>ttSince when do you stay up until
ttmidnight?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttAll right, all right... Can I
ttconcentrate?  And you can stop
ttpointing.  I've seen it.

<b>tttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttI've seen it too.

The voice is ENZO'S.  Another young boy wearing little
round glasses.

<b>tttttFIRST BOY
</b>ttt   (annoyed)
ttShit, it's the Italian!

He is slightly older than JACQUES but he is taller.  ENZO
is with ROBERTO, his younger brother, the only one allowed
to carry his flippers.  Five kids are behind him.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttWell, if it isn't the little
ttFrenchman!  How is the little
ttFrenchman?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (cool)
ttFine!

ENZO pats JACQUES on the shoulder and leaves his hand
there -- a lightly intimidating gesture.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou don't mind if I go instead, do
ttyou?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (intimidated, and
ttt    pretending not to
ttt    be)
ttNo...

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttIf you did mind, you'd tell me,
ttwouldn't you?

ENZO pats his shoulder reassuringly.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to his brother)
ttRoberto, mio palmo!

ROBERTO who has already started to moisten his big
brother's gear in the water, holds a pair of dripping
flippers and a glistening mask.  The pope watches the
scene with obvious pleasure.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to his brother on
ttt    the edge of the
ttt    pier)
ttCount!

Sure of himself, ENZO takes a deep breath and dives in the
water.  ROBERTO counts out loud.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b><b>tt1... 2... 3...
</b>
The kids all walk over to the edge of the pier.  A few
feet away, JACQUES takes off his flippers.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b><b>tt4... 5... 6...
</b>
ENZO bursts out of the water, the coin in his hand.  The
children cheer and clap.  ROBERTO rushes to catch the
equipment that comes flying at him, piece by piece.
ENZO walks over to JACQUES.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (showing him the
ttt    coin)
ttWho's is it now?  You saw it but I
ttdove for it!

JACQUES doesn't answer.

ENZO smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket.  He
pulls it out again and waves it under JACQUES' nose.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (without turning
ttt    around)
ttRoberto?  How long?

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttSix seconds.

ENZO looks at JACQUES for a while.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttI'll throw it back into the water.
ttYou dive and if you do less than
ttsix, it's yours.

JACQUES doesn't say anything, then finally shakes his
head, negatively.  ENZO smiles, taps him on the shoulder.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttBrava!

The first boy finally sums up his courage to speak.

<b>tttttBOY
</b>ttt   (timidly)
ttEnzo?  I saw the coin first... We
ttsplit?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttYou can't split a coin, stupid.

ENZO laughing, sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves
the pier with his gang.

The pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket.

With his flippers dangling from one hand, JACQUES sadly
stares out at the sea.  The pope calls him over.

<b>tttttPRIEST
</b>ttJacques... Come, look.

JACQUES goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the
faint gleam of the coin underwater.

<b>tttttPRIEST
</b>ttIs it a coin shining down there?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (overjoyed)
ttIt is.  It's a coin!  I'll get it
ttfor you, Father!

<b>tttttPRIEST
</b>ttIt'll be for the poor.

JACQUES, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on
his fins, prepares his mask.  He swims in the water like a
fish, goes directly to the coin.  Scoops it up, brings it
to the surface.

He breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and
sees he is no longer there.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttPadre?

He looks at the ancient impression on the coin -- "Boy on
a Dolphin".

<b>tttttttt    DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>ON JACQUES - UNDERWATER
</b>
He's swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel.
He senses something behind him and turns around.  He sees
a dolphin, still and silent, floating vertically.  It
seems to be watching him.  The surprise is such that
JACQUES is in a panic, leaps up to the surface...


<b>ON JACQUES - IN BED
</b>
He bolts upright, as if suddenly awakening from a dream.


<b>INT.  ROOM - ON JACQUES' FATHER - DARK
</b>
A BURLY MAN, around fifty, crosses the room in the shadows
and throws open the shutters with a bang.  Sunlight pours
in.  He walks over to JACQUES' bed in the one room house,
and runs his hand through his hair.

<b>tttttFATHER
</b>ttt   (with a smile)
tt... Come on, time to get up,
ttJacques!

JACQUES rubs his eyes.  His father walks over to a pile of
blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room.  He
gives the pile a kick.

<b>tttttFATHER
</b>ttt   (screaming at the
ttt    top of his lungs)
ttLouis, wake up!

He uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl
of soup for Jacques.  A fifty year old man pokes his head
out from under the pile of blankets.  It's UNCLE LOUIS,
who is having a very hard time, waking up.


<b>EXT.  HOUSE - DAY
</b>
JACQUES bursts out of the house, running.  Diving gear
under his arm.  A piece of buttered bread in his mouth.

He catches up with his father and UNCLE LOUIS.  They're on
a path winding down to the port.  JACQUES slows down
abruptly.  Tries to imitate their stride.  The weather is
balmy and the sea lies before them, peaceful and blue.


<b>EXT.  SEA - DAY
</b>
Their boat on the water.  The chug of its ENGINE ECHOES
off the cliffs.  A few gulls -- drawn by the sound -- skim
the waves of its wake.


<b>EXT.  BOAT - DAY
</b>
On board.  JACQUES' Father checks the antique air pump.
JACQUES polishes the enormous copper diver's helmet and
lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea diver's
suit.

At the foot of an old monastery another boat passes.
The Priest is in it.

JACQUES' Father and LOUIS take off their caps.  JACQUES
takes the gold coin out of his pocket.

The pope nods to JACQUES.  His father looks over at him
without understanding.  The child quickly puts the coin
back in his pocket.


<b>EXT.  BOAT - DAY
</b>
LOUIS casts anchor.  A few feet away, siting on a rock,
the kid with little round glasses is fishing.  He turns
around to the boat.  JACQUES smiles and waves at him.
ENZO waves back, obviously disturbed in his fishing
session.

<b>tttttFATHER
</b>ttJacques, come help me.

JACQUES helps his father into the diver's suit.  The burly
man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes.  He
seems sluggish and tired.  JACQUES watches worriedly.  He
has a weird feeling.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttYou shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttThen you shouldn't eat everyday,
ttJacques.

His father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck.

<b>tttttFATHER
</b>ttt   (winks at him)
ttDon't worry.  When I'm tired down
ttthere, the mermaids help me out.

Father and son smile at each other.  Then his father puts
the helmet on.  JACQUES joins LOUIS at the pump.

The heavy diver's suit disappears slowly underwater.  The
gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of
sight.

JACQUES and LOUIS work the pump.  Regular, steady motions
to maintain the flow of air.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttt   (to Jacques)
ttHey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttNo.

They keep on pumping for a while, then...

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttI've seen them.

UNCLE LOUIS goes on.  JACQUES doesn't budge.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttDon't you want to know where?

JACQUES looks at the bottom to watch his father.
He doesn't answer.


<b>UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER
</b>
He moves along slowly in his cumbersome diving suit.  He
is working the top of a rock outcrop on the sea floor.  He
sees a sponge, hooks it; puts it in a bag that's attached
to a life line from the boat fastened to his waist.  He
moves on.


<b>INT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS PUMPING
</b>
They keep up the rhythm.  Sitting on a rock at a distance,
ENZO watches them.  UNCLE LOUIS is bored stiff.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttWhy don't you ask me?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttWhere I saw the mermaids?!  Why
ttdon't you ever ask any question?
ttI'm always the one asking the
ttquestion!  We're sitting here like
tttwo stones and I'm taking to myself.
ttAsk me something, Goddamnit!

JACQUES calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping
and almost serenely asks him:

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (in a completely
ttt    flat tone)
ttWhy did my mother leave?

UNCLE LOUIS seems disturbed by the question.  A beat.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttt   (ill at ease)
ttCome on now, pump!


<b>UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER
</b>
He is walking with difficulty at the bottom.  His bag is
full of sponges.  He seems to be having trouble breathing.


<b>EXT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS
</b>
JACQUES and LOUIS are pumping silently.  UNCLE LOUIS feels
obliged to answer JACQUES' question.

UNCLE LOUIS finally breaks the silence and explains:

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttYour mother didn't leave.  She went
ttback to America, that's all.  It's
tther home.  She's allergic to this
ttIsland.  She likes refrigerators and
ttmachines that clean the floor... so
ttone day she left.  Woman are like
ttthat, unpredictable, like the sea.

They haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing
at the surface.  The air hose is being pulled down in a
very worrisome way.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (with a slight grin)
ttSo where did you see mermaids?

UNCLE LOUIS smiles.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttIn the bars in Athens!

Very pleased with himself, UNCLE LOUIS burst out laughing.
JACQUES shyly shrugs his shoulders.  The air hose is
suddenly yanked down.  JACQUES immediately sees all the
bubbles.  He is white as a sheet.

JACQUES rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling
down at his father.  He grabs the life line and starts
pulling at it hysterically.  The air hose snaps and
starts flying around like some crazy snake.  JACQUES tries
to jump overboard.  UNCLE LOUIS catches hold of his foot
at the last second.  JACQUES is slapping the water with
his hands, trying to go down but UNCLE LOUIS won't let
him.  JACQUES is yelling desperately.  ENZO is now
standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified.

The sea now looks as if it were boiling.

UNCLE LOUIS grabs hold of JACQUES and hugs him in his
arms.  Standing on his rock, ENZO is now crying
desperately.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (screaming)
ttJacques!  Jacques!

The last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface; it
looks as if they will never stop.

<b>tttttttt    DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  ITALIAN VILLAGE STREET - DAY
</b>
The image is now in color.

A rocky pink cliff over looks the very bright sea which
fills the screen.

<b>SUPERIMPOSED:  1987 SICILY
</b>
ALFREDO runs (skips) up the cobbled street as fast as he
can go, surprisingly fast.

He runs to the large terrace of a restaurant which he
enters.  We have time to read the sign carrying the
restaurant's name:  "LA MAMMA".


<b>INT.  RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
ALFREDO skips in.  He is panting, covered in sweat.  His
panic is palpable.  The whole room watches him approach a
long table where a large family is having a birthday party
for a very old lady.

He has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can
get the words out.  Then leans over and whispers in the
ear of a great big man -- around 30 -- built like a bull,
wearing little round glasses.

The man listens, then stiffens.


<b>EXT.  HARBOR - CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
</b>
A beat-up FIAT, towing an equally beat-up trailer, stops.

ENZO unfolds out of the driver's seat, like a circus clown
emerging from a toy car.

The construction SUPERVISOR, an American, wearing a three
piece suit, hurries over to him.

ENZO has already started undressing.  ROBERTO unloads the
diving gear from the trailer.

<b>tttttSUPERVISOR
</b>ttt   (exhausted)
ttSignore Molinari?

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttt   (shaking his hand)
ttYes.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (calmly undressing,
ttt    expressionless)
ttHow did it happen?

<b>tttttSUPERVISOR
</b>ttt   (upset)
ttThe company asked me to extract
tteverything I could from the wreck;
ttso the divers were trying to get at
ttthe engine... and then the boat
ttturned over... in the current...
ttand... look, I fucked up!  Can you
tthelp?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttHow many are, down there?

ENZO goes back to the car.

<b>tttttSUPERVISOR
</b>ttJust one... We're feeding him air,
ttbut he's not breathing regularly...
ttYou've got to get him out fast.

ENZO glances at the map, then at the accident site.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (a beat)
ttTen thousand.

<b>tttttSUPERVISOR
</b>ttLira?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttDollars.

<b>tttttSUPERVISOR
</b>ttYou're going to hold me up at a time
ttlike this?

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttYou do understand you're talking to
ttthe champion diver of the world?

<b>tttttSUPERVISOR
</b>ttYes, but ten thousand dollars...

ENZO opens the trunk of his FIAT and pulls out the jack.
He slams the trunk shut, and stands looking at the
American, straight in the eyes.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttOkay.  You tell me.  How much would
ttyou say the man's life is worth?

Extremely uncomfortable, the SUPERVISOR doesn't answer.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttIn my village, we have a saying:
ttwhen the wind blows, the flags of
ttall nations flap in the same
ttdirection.

<b>tttttSUPERVISOR
</b>ttt   (baffled)
ttWhat does that mean?

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttThat you should get your checkbook.
ttDamn quick.


<b>EXT.  UNFINISHED PIER - ENZO
</b>
He's at the end of the pier, his feet dangling in the
muddy water of the port.  A few feet away a pump sends air
HISSING through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below.

ENZO inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow.
He carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons
his flippers, etc., with his usual flair of suspense.

Behind him the SUPERVISOR and other construction workers
watch expectantly.  ROBERTO heaves a stone weight into the
bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the
pier.

ENZO ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack,
flip-flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit
bottom.  He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay.


<b>UNDERWATER - WRECK
</b>
ENZO dives down a chimney of muck.  Picks his way over and
around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped
under a huge piece of debris.

He pats his shoulder to comfort him, he then inserts the
tire jack under a piece of concrete... And, as if he were
changing a tire, begins to pump the handle...

Slowly, in a swirl of mud and water, the chunk of debris
rises off the diver's leg.


<b>EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
</b>
Everyone is staring at the water silently, suspensefully.
The SUPERVISOR has his checkbook in hand, but has
completely forgotten it, intent upon what's going on
underwater.  ROBERTO taps him on the shoulder.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttSince we have a little time, what do
ttyou say you write that check?


<b>UNDERWATER - WRECK
</b>
ENZO cuts the cables tangled around the diver's torso.
Then he takes off his flippers, plants his bare feet on
the concrete, grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls
him free.

The diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as
possible toward the surface.


<b>EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
</b>
The diver surfaces, gasping for breath.  A cheer goes up
from the crowd.  Several men hurry to pull him onto dry
land.  But there is no sign of ENZO.  Everyone waits,
breathless.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttt   (to the Supervisor)
ttSign here.

Suddenly, ENZO appears, burst out of the water, holding
his flippers up in the air like a trophy.  The onlookers
cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the
back.

ENZO tosses the jack and his flippers to ROBERTO.
Impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize
fighter's robe that ROBERTO holds out for him, walks
solemnly back to his car.

ROBERTO takes the check and walks over to the car.  ENZO
bends down into the car and opens the roof.

<b>tttttSUPERVISOR
</b>ttt   (through the open
ttt    roof smiling)
ttThanks, thanks a lot.  I mean that
tttoo... You extortionist bastard!

The car rushes off.  In the distance we see a police
(carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the
direction of the construction site.


<b>INSIDE FIAT - DRIVING AWAY
</b>
ENZO'S car drives past them.  ENZO looks at ROBERTO out of
the corner of his eye, then suddenly explodes with joy.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttDollars, Roberto!  We took him for
ttten thousand dollars!

ROBERTO whoops and whistles.  ENZO reaches over and leans
on the horn.  The little car races by and finally stops at
the top of the cliff facing the sea.


<b>EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY
</b>
The two brothers sit back, relax.

Stare out to sea.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttt   (after a while)
ttEnzo, what are you going to do with
ttthe money?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttHave the car painted.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttSantini will do that for 25 dollars!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttThen tell him to wax it too.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttEnzo, really.  What are you going to
ttget?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (thinking)
ttA rosary for Mama, a dress for
ttAngelica, something with rhine-
ttstones for what's her name, and get
ttyourself a suit that fits... But
ttmost important...

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttYes?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttFind the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.


<b>EXT.  FLAKES OF SNOW - MOUNTAINS - DAY
</b>
Mountain peaks, stark and white.  A winter sky which is
strangely and disquietingly dark.  A landscape swept by
snow.

<b>SUPERIMPOSED ON SCREEN: PERU - LAKE HUACRACOCHA - MAY 1987
</b>
A yellow light comes out of the storm -- advances toward
us.  The headlight of a train.

A narrow gauge locomotive steams up grade pushing piles of
snow in front of it.


<b>INT.  TRAIN - DAY
</b>
Sitting in the train, leaning against the misty window,
JOHANA CROSS, 27, has clear quick charm and a sort of
romantic fragility.  She is dressed simply but warmly.
She looks through the window; all she sees is white.

It is clear that she was not the one who decided on this
trip.  Reading the key phrases from a beat-up note book,
she calls upon an old Peruvian.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (in Spanish)
ttIs this the Lago del Demonio?
tt(Es bien aqui el Lago del Demonio)
tt... Huacracocha?

The old man goes into a long, rambling explanation.
JOHANA nods without understanding a thing.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttGracias.

<b>tttttOLD MAN
</b>ttYou welcome.


<b>EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAY
</b>
The train pulls in, slowly pushing piles of snow in front
of it and finally stops in front of an old shack which
serves as the station.

A man, FRANK, bundled in a parka, comes out of a
snowmobile parked by the station, and walks up to the
train.

JOHANA steps down, carrying her suitcase and drops two
feet in the snow as she comes off the last step.  FRANK
walks over and leans down towards her.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttWelcome to Peru!

FRANK throws the luggage into the back of the snowmobile,
jumps in and turns the ignition on.  JOHANA takes her hat,
scarf and gloves off.  FRANK glances over at her, he is
both amused and charmed.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttDon't you have a heater?

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt   (hitting at the
ttt    dashboard)
ttYeah... Sure... Is this your first
tttrip to Peru?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttDoes anybody live to make a second?

FRANK smiles and kicks the heating system, then leans over
to check it, his eyes off the road.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (a little worried)
ttForget about the heater!


<b>EXT.  LAKE OF THE DEMON - CAMP - DAY
</b>
The storm is at its peak.  The frozen snowmobile plows
along side the lake HUACRACOCHA and stops in front of a
cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow.

FRANK gets the bags out of the back.  The suitcases are by
now frozen stiff.  JOHANA follows in his steps.

A couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in
attempt to protect themselves from the storm.

JOHANA is bewildered.  Shacks in the middle of the Andes,
the lake of the "Demon", and now llama that have to be
pushed aside to enter one's home.

As FRANK opens the door, a man is leaving the hut.  The
man is JACQUES MAYOL.  JOHANA and JACQUES pass each other
in slow motion.  Everything seems suddenly suspended:
time, sound, cold...

JACQUES MAYOL instantly makes an impression on her.  He is
now 34, still dark-haired, with dark eyes.  He is wearing
a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles.  He looks
like some legendary creature one would dream about.

Everything finally regains its formal speed.  The door
slams, the man is gone.  She and FRANK are in the middle
of the entrance hall.  JOHANA hasn't yet gotten over the
vision she has just had, but she regains composure and
enters the next room.


<b>INT.  QUONSET HUT
</b>
JOHANA happily takes her gloves off.

FRANK puts down the bags and walks into the next room.
It's a sort of laboratory, filled with ultra modern
equipment.

A big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a
long wooden dock.

Sitting in a corner, an old Peruvian man is preparing hot
drinks.  JOHANA drops into a chair.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttA drink to warm up?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYes, thank you.  Intravenous if
ttpossible.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt   (pulling out a flask)
ttTea... or whiskey?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>tt... both.  Did I just see a man in a
ttred suit and goggles?

FRANK smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tt... right.
ttt   (calling out)
ttDr. Lawrence?  The insurance man...
ttuh... The insurance person is here!

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttIt's about time!

FRANK smiles and pours JOHANA some tea.  She warms her
hands on the cup.  She asks blankly.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWould it be out of place to ask what
tthe's doing?

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttWho?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttThe guy in the Halloween suit!

LAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room.

He walks straight over to the bay window.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttDid you have a nice trip?  We were
ttgetting restless, it's been three
ttweeks since the accident.

JOHANA walks over to the bay window and starts staring at
something in the distance.


<b>EXT.  DOCK - ON JACQUES
</b>
At the end of the dock, JACQUES who is sitting on the edge
of a hole which is cut in the ice, is putting a pair of
gloves on.  He then grabs the handles of a strange machine
which emerges from the water and starts taking deep
breaths, oblivious to the cold, his mind completely
elsewhere.


<b>BACK IN LAB
</b>
JOHANA watches JACQUES.  She just can't believe her eyes.
LAWRENCE is bent over one of his machines, fiddling with
different switches.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttt   (to Johana)
ttYou should get things moving, you
ttknow.  We're out of equipment and we
ttcan't do half of our experiments...!
ttFrank, check the program!

JOHANA is finally able to speak.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWho... Who is that?

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttMayol... Jacques Mayol.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttThat's the experiment?  Dumping a
ttguy into a frozen lake?

LAWRENCE turns one last knob.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>tt... The truck fell into a very deep
ttcrevasse.  We weren't able to save
ttthe equipment.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI'll have to talk to the driver.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttIn the spring when he melts!

JOHANA walks closer to the window.  She isn't hearing a
thing he's saying.

JACQUES is putting on his flippers.

JOHANA can't believe it.

JACQUES is standing by a hole cut in the ice.  He is
holding onto the machine in the water.  He is waving a
mask.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (dumbfounded)
ttYou really send him under the ice?
ttHe isn't a slave or a convict or
ttanything?

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttMy dear, science is a cruel
ttmistress.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttBut... how is he going to breathe?

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttHe isn't going to breathe.

JACQUES takes a deep breath, turns a handle and a weight
yanks him straight down into the water.  LAWRENCE sets his
stop watch off and flips a few switches.

JOHANA grabs his arm as if they could do something about
it.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttListen...

He raises the volume:  we hear the man's heartbeat through
a small speaker.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttThat's his heartbeat.
ttt   (excited)
ttCan you hear the speed at which it's
ttslowing down, it's incredible.

LAWRENCE tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures
on it and hands it to JOHANA.

JOHANA feels she's on the verge of crying, and can't
figure it out.


<b>UNDERWATER - JACQUES
</b>
JACQUES stops his machine by turning one of the handles.
He's deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake.  He
swims deliberately, carefully into a large tube which is
hinged open.  He closes it around himself.  His heart is
still slowing down.  He pushes a button on the machine,
and a flash of light bursts in the opaque night
surrounding him.


<b>BACK IN LAB - ON VIDEO SCREEN
</b>
We see a moving X-ray image.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttHe's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen
ttto his heart.  Impressive, huh?  The
ttflow of blood is concentrated in the
ttbrain and doesn't even feed the
ttlimbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that
tthas only been observed with
ttdolphins... until now.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttHow long can he stay down?  Without
ttbreathing?

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttIt depends.  He should come up soon.
ttt   (smiling)
ttUnless he's decided to stay for the
ttnight.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWhy is he doing this?

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttFor one thing, it's his job... as
ttfor the rest of it, I wish I knew.

JOHANA sighs with relief as JACQUES appears at the surface
in one big breath.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttShouldn't somebody take him a
ttblanket or something?

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttt   (smiling at Frank)
ttCoffee might be nice.

She heads towards the Old Peruvian and pours a cup of
coffee...

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (afterthought)
ttWill he understand Spanish?

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttHis mother's an American.  He spent
tthalf of his life in the states.  I'd
tttry English if I were you.


<b>EXT.  DOCK - JACQUES SURFACING
</b>
He's groggy, half hypnotized.  He looks up at the dock,
sees JOHANA with a cup of coffee.  He stares at her.  She
hands him the coffee.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (puzzled)
ttI recognize you.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWe saw each other a little while
ttago.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (serious)
ttIn the lake?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (wondering whether he
ttt    is joking or not)
ttNo... in the hut.

After a long beat...

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (with a beautiful
ttt    smile)
ttThen it was somebody that looked a
ttlot like you... Thank you.

JACQUES then turns around and walks toward the huts.

JOHANA still hasn't moved, as if petrified by her emotions
and the severe cold.  She then walks up to the hole in the
ice and peers into the dark water.  She shudders.


<b>INT.  CABIN - DAWN
</b>
JOHANA emerges from a down sleeping bag.  She's wearing a
big sweater and a wool hat.  She is not sleeping.

Intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile, she gets up and
walks over to the frozen window.  JACQUES and FRANK are
loading their luggage onto the snowmobile.

Outside, LAWRENCE is saying "Goodbye" to JACQUES.  Unseen,
JOHANA also waves from behind her curtain.  JACQUES senses
something:  he turns around toward the cabin and smiles,
waving his hand at JOHANA.  She hides behind the curtain
and shyly waves back.

JACQUES gets into the snowmobile and drives out of the
frame.  We are left with an endless array of snow-caped
mountains.

<b>tttttttt    DISSOLVE TO:

Fixed image of the Cote d'Azur.  The sparkling blue sea
fades into the distance.

A French taxi rides along the winding road overlooking the
creeks.


<b>INT.  - TAXI
</b>
From behind all his bags, JACQUES obsessively stares at
the sea.

The driver smiles.

<b>tttttDRIVER
</b>ttIt's beautiful, isn't it?

JACQUES smiles.

<b>tttttDRIVER
</b>ttWe had some bad wind this week.  The
tt"Mistral"!!  "Peuchere"!  There
ttisn't one olive left on its tree.
ttIt suddenly left us this morning...
ttI sure won't be the one to call it
ttback.


<b>EXT.  ANTIBES - ROAD TO MARINELAND
</b>
The taxi comes to a stop in front of Marineland.  JACQUES
gets out, carrying one of his bags.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (to the driver)
ttI'll only be five minutes.

He enters Marineland.


<b>EXT.  MARINELAND - ON JACQUES
</b>
The park is closed, the paths are deserted.  JACQUES
approaches the Dolphin's tank.  All three dolphins rise up
in the water.  Greet him with a click and clatter of
tongues.  JACQUES sits down at the edge of the tank.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttGood morning, everybody!  Did you
ttsleep well?  I slept in a plane, and
ttit wasn't too great.

He opens his duffel bag.  Hunts around, comes up with two
packages wrapped in brownpaper.  The dolphins stare at
him, intrigued.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (calling out)
ttHey!  presents.

The dolphins CACKLE some more.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttYou think I'd forget you?

He laughs.  The driver, who seems to be quite familiar
with the place, walks in heading straight over to the soda
machine.  Out of the corner of his eye, he takes in the
scene, very intrigued.

JACQUES has not noticed him.

He starts unwrapping the first package.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttFor Bathsheba.

He produces a little ceramic Llama.

<b>ON BATHSHEBA
</b>
looking at the llama, bewildered.  As bewildered as a
dolphin can be.  JACQUES turns the llama upside down.  It
moos:  HIAK, HIAK...

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttIt's a Llama.  You understand?  From
ttPeru.  It's fighting.

BATHSHEBA shakes her head.  JACQUES throws the llama into
the water.  He unwraps the second package.  A pair of
Peruvian gloves and hat.  Wide eyed, the driver sits in
the stands to watch the show.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttThat's for you, Darjeeling.  We
ttwouldn't want you to catch cold!

He throws them to DARJEELING who catches them.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttAnd now...
ttt   (singing out)
tt"Ta, da..." For you Tina.

He pulls out a thermos.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttSomething you've never seen either.

He opens the thermos.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttSnow!

He sprinkles snow flakes on TINA'S head.  She tries to
taste it.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (smiling like a
ttt    child)
ttA new experience, Tina.
ttt   (nostalgic)
ttI missed you little rascals.  Did
ttyou get my post card?

The three dolphins leap into the air and land with a huge
splash which soaks JACQUES.  He takes his shirt off.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (pretending to be
ttt    serious)
ttOh?  Is that what you want?
ttAlright, but five minutes, no more.
ttI have a taxi waiting.

He takes off his pants.  The taxi driver gets up, as if to
keep him from going in.  JACQUES dives into the pool.


<b>UNDERWATER - ON JACQUES
</b>
He swims under the dolphin, reaches out and grabs hold of
the dolphin's snout.

The dolphin pulls JACQUES around and around the basin
while JACQUES pets his chest and belly.  We have never
seen JACQUES so relaxed and happy.

Overview of a gray and dirty Manhattan morning.  JOHANA
depressed, stares blankly out of the window of a yellow

Brooklyn Bridge.

The driver keeps yelling obscenities to all the cars
around him.

A suitcase in each hand, JOHANA gets out of the cab and
walks up the stairs of her apartment.

JOHANA puts down her suitcase wearily.  Catches her breath
and gets out her keys.  She tries one in the top lock.  It
doesn't work.  She tries harder.  There's a woman's voice
yelling angrily from inside the apartment.

ttIt can't be true!

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (fast talking)
ttWe have to send somebody over there
ttimmediately!  If we prove the
ttforgery we can cancel the policy.
ttWe'll be off the hook.  There's a
ttflight to Rome in two hours and from
ttthere its just a short hop to

<b>tttttDUFFY
</b>ttt   (reaching for phone)
ttI'll send Cardoza, he'll be able
ttto...

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (interrupting)
ttI tried him, he can't go.  His son

ttI'll go, boss.

<b>tttttDUFFY
</b>ttI thought it was Spanish that you

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (after a beat)
ttItalian is practically the same
ttthing.


<b>EXT.  PORT OF MESSINE - DAY
</b>
A ferry comes into the dock, as a plank is slowly lowered.

As it descends, four rail cars lie in wait in its belly.
JOHANA comes off the boat, carrying her suitcase, she
wears a light summer dress.  She looks around, seeming a
little lost.

A white FIAT taxi screeches to a halt beside her.  JOHANA
jumps.  The driver whose arm loosely dangles from the car
window, grins at her.

<b>tttttDRIVER
</b>tt... Taxi?


<b>EXT.  SAN DOMENICO - DAY
</b>
The white FIAT taxi pulls up in front of the SAN DOMENICO
hotel, but it is JACQUES who gets out of it.  The driver
helps him with his bags.

<b>tttttRECEPTIONIST
</b>ttt   (checking the books)
ttMayol... Mayol... No reservation.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (uncomfortable)
tt... Are you sure?

<b>tttttRECEPTIONIST
</b>ttPositive, Sir.

JACQUES looks down at the piece of paper stapled to his
ticket.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttThis is the hotel San Domenico?

<b>tttttRECEPTIONIST
</b>ttYes Sir, and it has been so for 127
ttyears.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (more and more
ttt    uncomfortable)
ttYes, but... So, you haven't got a
ttroom left?

<b>tttttRECEPTIONIST
</b>ttNo Sir, the hotel is full because of
ttthe Diving championship.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttAh?!

The Receptionist starts working on his papers again.
JACQUES, completely lost, stares blankly at the hotel
clerk, wondering what to do next.


<b>INT.  HOTEL - DAY
</b>
The tiny FIAT clatters onto the sidewalk in front of the
hotel narrowly avoiding the Countess' limo.  Parks its
frontwheels on the sidewalk, rear end in the road.

ENZO, followed by ROBERTO, get out of his car, like a king
descending from his carriage.  On the way, he stops and
kisses a distinguished elderly woman's hand?  The hotel's
<b>CONTESSA.
</b>
ENZO tosses his keys to a doorman who stepped up to
complain.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to doorman)
ttBe careful with that car, it's a new
ttpaint job.

ENZO enters the hotel and sees JACQUES.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (yelling across the
ttt    lobby)
ttGiacomino!  My friend!  My brother!

ENZO and JACQUES.  The two men kiss each other on both
cheeks, pound each others back.  They are both moved.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (looking at him)
ttSo you finally decided to join us?
ttYou did the right thing!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to the desk clerk)
ttHey Paolo!  Come stai?  Get my key!
ttt   (to Jacques,
ttt    gesturing over his
ttt    shoulder)
ttYou remember my little brother
ttRoberto?

Roberto (26) nods to JACQUES who shakes his hand.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI remember.  Hi Roberto!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttWhat room have you got?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI don't have one.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou don't have a room?
ttt   (at the top of his
ttt    lungs)
ttPaolo?  What did I just hear?  I
ttpersonally called you to reserve a
ttroom for my good friend Jacques
ttMayol and you treat him like a
ttstranger?!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (embarrassed)
ttIt's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere
ttelse.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttNot only is Jacques Mayol a very

ttone of the best divers in the world!
ttAnd you're throwing him out!  Are
ttyou crazy, or what?  Stupido!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (really embarrassed
ttt    now)
ttEnzo drop it, I'll find something.

ENZO looks at him for a moment and gives him a warm smile.

He hands him his own keys.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttTake mine.  I'll take the Countess'
ttsuite.  She told me she was leaving
ttfor the cemetery... She'll be more
ttcomfortable there.

PAOLO half-heartedly, hands him the key.  ENZO glances at
JACQUES to make sure he's properly impressed.  He throws
his arm around JACQUES' shoulder, hugs him and gives him a
real smile.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (sincerely)
ttI'm glad you're here.


<b>EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - DAY
</b>
They're at a table on a terrace that overlooks the sea.
They've just arrived and all around them people are
lunching away furiously.

ENZO beckons to a passing WAITER who comes to the table.
He's a very handsome, slightly effeminate young man.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to waiter)
tt"Spaghetti del mare"
ttt   (to Jacques)
ttIt's delicious here.  It's the one
ttthing they really know how to make.

<b>tttttWAITER
</b>ttDel mare for two?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (nodding quickly)
ttYes, sure, for two.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttAnd a bottle of "Frascatti".  Two
ttbottles!

<b>tttttWAITER
</b>ttSi Signore, grazie mille.

The waiter hurries away.  ENZO watches his departure, then
thoughtfully.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttHe moves just like a woman.
ttt   (then, as if he were
ttt    speaking to Jacques)
ttIt must be hard to live in two
ttworlds like that, huh?  To breathe
ttin one, swim in the other...

JACQUES nods without really knowing.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (suddenly louder)
ttAnyway!  Nothing beats a sexy broad!
ttHuh, Jacques!

ENZO starts laughing.  JACQUES would like to crawl under
the table.

<b>tttttttt TIME DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - LATER
</b>
Their lunch is on the table, half eaten.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>tt... So, after all these years, you
ttmust have lots of questions to ask.
ttAm I right?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (quickly)
ttYes, of course.  Lots of questions.

JACQUES is satisfied with his answer.  He thinks that the
subject is closed.  They eat silently for a moment.  ENZO
watches him.  Then:

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttWell, what are they?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (giving up)
ttI'm sorry... I don't know how to ask
ttthe questions.

ENZO bursts out laughing.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttWell, then.  I'll do the asking for
ttyou.  "Tell me dear Enzo, how did
ttyou become World Champion?"  Oh,
ttthat's a long story.
ttt   (his voice changes)
ttWell, after you left Amorgos, I went
ttback to Italy and joined the Navy.
ttSo you now have in front of you --
ttCaptain Molinari, who's been on
ttleave of absence for the past 14
ttyears...

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttThat's good.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttHow do you make a living?  Your
ttexperiments, does it pay well?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttIt's okay.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>tt... You married?

JACQUES doesn't seem to have ever thought about marriage.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttNo.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttMe neither, 'cause of my Mother.
ttShe's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado.
ttStubborn as a mule!  I was
ttengaged... for a week.  After that,
ttMamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta
ttwas bouncing off the walls.

JACQUES smiles.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttSo, not married.  Well, good for
ttyou.  You play the field, like me.
ttA girl in every port, huh?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (bluffing)
ttExactly, I mean, after all, we're
ttmen!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (slapping the table
ttt    top)
ttDamn right!  That's what I tell them
ttwhen people say you've turned into a
ttfish.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (concerned)
ttPeople say that?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (sorry he went too
ttt    far)
ttForget it.  I was joking.


<b>EXT.  ENTRANCE TO TERRACE - ON JOHANA
</b>
JOHANA comes out of the stone tunnel which leads to the
terrace.  She looks over the crowd, trying to find
someone.

JACQUES is sitting with his back to her.  She finally
spots him and walks over to the table.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttEh!  La Madonna!  This one is for
ttme.  I'll bet you my watch that
ttshe's in my bed tonight.

JACQUES turns around and recognizes her.  JOHANA smiles
and walks up to the table.  ENZO takes his watch off and
puts it on the table.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (quickly)
ttI tell you she's mine!

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (to Jacques)
ttHello!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (surprised)
ttYou know each other?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttEnzo Molinari.

ENZO kisses her hand and brushes his watch off the table
in the same movement.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttThis is a great pleasure.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (laughing at the
ttt    protocol)
ttJohana Cross, pleased to meet you.
ttt   (then to Jacques,
ttt    faking surprise)
ttWell!  Isn't this a coincidence.  I
ttreally wasn't expecting this... All
ttthe way out here.  It's incredible!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttPlease, have a seat.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttThank you.  I wouldn't want to
ttinterrupt anything.

JOHANA sits down.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttNo, no!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttNot at all!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttYou're staying at the hotel?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI wish, but it's full.  They
ttrecommended a pension in town.  They
ttsay that all of Taormina is full.
ttWhat's going on here?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttIt's the Free Diving World
ttChampionship.  I am by the way world
ttchampion!

JOHANA has turned toward JACQUES, paying no attention to
ENZO.  JACQUES can't stop looking at JOHANA.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttBut what brought you to Sicily?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI was doing an insurance
ttinvestigation in Palermo.
ttt   (to Enzo)
ttI work for an insurance company.
ttt   (back to Jacques)
ttSo, I decided to take a few days
ttoff.
ttt   (uncomfortable)
ttI don't know this island at all.  It
ttreally is gorgeous.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttThere is no place in the world more
ttbeautiful than Sicily!

The waiter passes behind them.  ENZO reaches out, grabs
him by the arm, pulls him to the table.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to waiter)
ttA spaghetti del mare for the super
ttdedicated traveling insurance
ttagent.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttI think I'll have a coffee.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttNo, no.  You'll like it.  It's
ttsuperb.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>tt... Okay.  I'll try.

ENZO pours the wine.

JOHANA shrugs fatalistically.  The waiter leaves.
JACQUES, intrigued, stares at JOHANA.  She pretends not to
notice.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (impatient)
ttWhere did you two meet?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttIn a lake.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttI might have known.
ttt   (to Johana)
ttAs I was telling you earlier, I'm
ttthe world champion free diver.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttCongratulations.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttSome people say it's the most virile
ttsport in the world.  One has to
ttadmit that when you see those men
ttdiving head first in that deep blue
ttsea, all muscles contracted in one
ttsuper human effort...

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (interrupting)
ttEnzo?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (annoyed)
ttWhat?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttYour mother?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttAhi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia!
ttWhere...?  God, she'll kill me...
ttt   (pushing the plate
ttt    in front of Johana)
tt... if she catches me eating pasta
ttin a restaurant.

He quickly brushes off the crumbs in front of him.

<b>ON ENZO'S MOTHER
</b>
heading toward them.  She's a huge woman in widow's black.
She shoulders her way through the tables.

ROBERTO carrying her suitcases follows at her heels.

ENZO jumps to his feet.  Throws his arms around her.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>tt... Mamma!

<b>tttttMAMMA MOLINARI
</b>ttt   (expressionless)
ttYou expect me to carry all the
ttluggage myself?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttMamma.  Roberto and an elevator...
ttIsn't that enough?

A beat.  Signora MOLINARI inspects the plates on the
table.

<b>tttttMAMMA MOLINARI
</b>ttt   (suspiciously)
ttWhat have you been eating?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttCoffee only, I'm diving tomorrow.
ttYou remember little Jacques, Jacques
ttMayol...

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (timidly)
ttMadame...

<b>tttttENZO
</b>tt... And his friend, Johana...

Signora MOLINARI nods grudgingly.

<b>tttttWAITER
</b>ttt   (arriving proudly)
ttSpaghetti del mare!

Dead silence.

ENZO is the only one with no plate in front of him.
Signora MOLINARI'S eyebrows condense into a dark stripe
across her forehead.

JOHANA hands ENZO'S plate to the WAITER and takes the full
one.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (to waiter)
ttThank you.

And begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement
all around her.

<b>tttttMAMMA MOLINARI
</b>ttAmericana?

JOHANA nods enthusiastically, her mouth too full to speak.

<b>tttttMAMMA MOLINARI
</b>ttt   (impressed, to
ttt    Johana)
ttBenvenuto!

MAMMA MOLINARI has a huge grin on her face.


<b>EXT.  TAORMINA STREET - JACQUES, JOHANA - TWILIGHT
</b>
They emerge onto the street in front of the entrance of a
small rooming house.

JACQUES is carrying JOHANA'S luggage.  The old pension is
covered in bright pink bougainvilliers, there is laundry
hanging on the other side of the street.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttThanks for helping with the bag.
ttt   (she looks up at the
ttt    pension with little
ttt    enthusiasm)
ttIt looks great!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI thought it was a nice place.
ttt   (suddenly doubting)
ttIsn't it?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI'm being a pain in the ass.
ttt   (looking at him)
ttIt's beautiful here.

They look at each other.  JACQUES is silent.  He just
stands there, a suitcase in each hand.

JOHANA breaks the silence.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYou're going to be very busy these
ttdays aren't you?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI don't know... why?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttJust because... I would have liked
ttto visit the town... See the
ttcoast... I don't know anybody...
ttExpect for you.
ttt   (feeling she has
ttt    gone too far)
ttBut you are going to be very busy.
ttYou must have tons of things to
ttprepare, interviews... And a
ttcompetition like this one must
ttrequire a great deal of
ttconcentration, right?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (shakes his head
ttt    negatively)
ttYes... Maybe... I don't know.  I
ttdon't like competitions... It ruins
ttthe fun.  Don't you think?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (with a faint smile)
ttI guess... But you know... I'm
ttAmerican and I've mostly been taught
ttto be competitive... There's always
ttpleasure of being the best?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttMaybe on earth there is one... but
ttnot when you dive... You see, to
ttdive deep into the sea, for no
ttreason... just to do it.  It's a
ttfeeling... I don't know how to say
ttthis... Voluptuous?

He looks up at her as he pronounces the last word.  She
smiles at him, lovingly.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (laughing)
ttYou can put down the suitcases, you
ttknow.

He lets go of the suitcases.  Suddenly, behind them, there
is a loud screech of tires.  The FIAT tears across the
street.

ENZO in his FIAT.  He pokes his head out of the window.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttC'mon, you two... Jacques, we have
ttto get ready for the ceremony
tttonight.  We have a new world
ttchampion.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI'm a little tired, I don't know

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttGet in the car!


<b>INT.  ENZO'S SUITE - ENZO, JACQUES, ROBERTO - NIGHT
</b>
They're in front of a wardrobe looking JACQUES over in the
full-length mirrors.  He's wearing an evening shirt and a
tuxedo of ENZO'S.  The collar is too big, the sleeves
hangover his hands.  He looks at himself dubiously in the
mirror.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttRoberto!  The bow-tie!

ROBERTO hands ENZO the bow-tie, he hooks it around
JACQUES' collar.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (taking a few steps
ttt    back)
ttVery good.

JACQUES looks down at his tennis shoes.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttWhat about the shoes?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttVery chic.
ttt   (hesitates)
ttAnyway, you don't have anything
ttelse, do you?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttNo.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttThen, it's very chic.  Avanti!


<b>EXT.  RECEPTION ON TERRACE - NIGHT
</b>
A big reception is organized on the terrace of the hotel.
The official divers and technicians are all gathered in
front of a podium.  The terrace is loaded with
photographers.

ROBERTO keeps turning round and round the long buffet
table.

JACQUES is alone at the bar.  Incongruous detail:  a
whiskey bottle on the table beside him.

JOHANA enters.  She has also had a few drinks.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI thought you'd be at the dinner.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttIt's too loud for me.

He tugs at his over-sized tuxedo.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYou look adorable.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttThank you...

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (smiling)
tt... Especially the sneakers.

JACQUES looks down at his feet, doesn't know what to make
of her comment.  JOHANA sits down beside him and pours
herself a drink.  They touch glasses.


<b>EXT.  ON PODIUM - NIGHT
</b>
On the podium, NOVELLI, the organizer of the championship,
stands in his tuxedo, talking into a microphone.  An older
man in a worn out suit, stands next to him.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttLadies and Gentlemen, your
ttattention, please.  Mr. Andre
ttBonnet, President of the
ttInternational Diving Championship
ttCommittee, is going to present this
tttrophy to the new world champion of

ttnew champion descended to the
ttremarkable depth of 280 feet.

The audience applauds.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttThis young man Tia...

NOVELLI can't quite read his notes.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttTiraro... Tirao-re... Moa...

ANDRE BONNET takes his turn to read the note.  A young
Tahitian jumps up, heads for the podium.

<b>tttttTAHITIAN
</b>ttTiraero Moameora.

NOVELLI hesitates to repeat the name.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>tt... Let's all give him a big hand.

The audience cheers and applauds the new champion.  ENZO
sits at a table, watching the ceremony.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (very sarcastic)
ttA one day hero!

He gets up and walks out of the room.


<b>INT.  BAR - NIGHT
</b>
JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting at the bar.  The whiskeys
have gone to their heads.  ENZO walks over to them.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttA new world record!  That's great!
ttIt gives me something to beat
tttomorrow!
ttt   (to Johana)
ttYou ever been to Tahiti?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttNo.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttI'll take you there.  We'll live in
ttthe sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and
ttwe'll make love under the coconut
tttrees.

JOHANA smiles and shakes her head.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYou forgot the Hula!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYes, of course, I'll do the Hula!

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYou'll be lovely, but no thanks.
ttt   (to Jacques)
ttJacques, would you do a native dance
ttfor me?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI don't know how... Excuse me.

JACQUES leaves the bar.  JOHANA watches him go.  ENZO
notices her way of watching him.  He's a little jealous.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttHe looks strange, doesn't he?  Like
tta baby that just learned to walk.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttHave you known him long?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttForever.  We used to live on the
ttsame island in Greece, when we were
ttkids.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWhat was he like, when he was little?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttLittle.  Very little.  And skinny,
ttvery skinny too.  That is compared
ttto me.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (amused)
ttI get it, Enzo you were a superior
ttchild.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttExactly!  What is it Johana?  You're
ttso crazy about him, you don't see
ttthe truth?!

She doesn't answer.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttForget it, don't think of Jacques as
tta human being.  He's from another
ttworld.

She smiles.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttAnd just where are you from?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttItaly!


<b>EXT.  TERRACE OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
ENZO sits at the grand piano in the corner of the terrace.
Beethoven was always a favorite of his.

JACQUES, very tipsy by now walks over, a glass in each
hand.  He hands ENZO a glass, then takes off his tennis
shoes and sits them neatly on the piano.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttThere is nothing like music.  It
ttspeaks from the heart.  Can you tell
ttme why we bother diving in the dark,
ttthe cold, without ever taking the
tttime to breathe?  Huh?  Can you tell
ttme why we do it?

JACQUES nods.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttWhy?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>tt... For the mermaids.

ENZO smiles, moved.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttMy father used to see them
tteverywhere too... but the only one
tthe ever caught was my mother...
ttActually she caught him.

A beat.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttToday at lunch, you asked me if I
tthad any questions.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttAh ha.  You finally want to know
ttabout women.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWhy?  Are they what's most
ttimportant?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttNo... It depends... Sometimes they

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>tt... Everything.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttEverything about what?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (thinking)
ttWell... about everything.

ENZO grins at JACQUES and starts playing again.

<b>tttttttTIME DISSOLVE TO LATER:
</b>
<b>JACQUES AND ENZO
</b>
There are now several empty champagne bottles around.
They are both quite drunk.  ENZO is philosophizing.
JOHANA is looking for them.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>tt... So, between Mamma, Roberto and
ttthe sisters, we yell and scream all
ttday long.  Except with Angelica.
ttShe just cries.  And then finally,
ttwe all end up kissing.  Can you
ttexplain that to me?

JACQUES can't answer.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttBecause that's what love is all
ttabout.  It's a pain in the ass but
ttkeeps us together.
ttt   (then, in a half
ttt    dreaming, half
ttt    desperate tone)
ttA large and beautiful family!

JOHANA walks over to them.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (suddenly)
ttEnzo... We must quit the
ttcompetition.

ENZO hits a wrong note on the piano.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (worried)
ttWhy?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttIf we don't... I'm going to beat
ttyou.

JOHANA stands next to JACQUES.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (with a nervous
ttt    laugh)
ttHuh?  Well listen to him!
ttt   (to Johana)
ttDo you hear that?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttNo.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttHe looks me in the eye like some
ttfuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm
ttgoing to beat you".

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (with a smile)
tt... That's what he's here for, isn't
tthe?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttListen to her!  "That's what he's
tthere for"!  He's here to loose,
ttthat's what he's here for.  First of
ttall, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how
ttold are you?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttTwo years younger than you.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttAs I said, second of all you're too
ttskinny.  You've got tiny lungs.  I
ttstill don't understand how you can
ttdive without getting sick.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttThe size of the lungs has nothing to
ttdo with it!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttLook at me.  These aren't lungs.
ttThese are... Tanks.  How long can
ttyou hold your breath?

ENZO is getting really angry.  The drinks have a lot to do
with it.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (impatiently)
ttI don't know.  Longer than you.

ENZO pulls open his collar and rises.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttWe'll see.


<b>EXT.  HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - UNDERWATER - NIGHT
</b>
JACQUES and ENZO dive into the pool in their Tuxedos.
Each one carries a beach umbrella in a concrete base to
help them stay at the bottom.

ENZO takes two goblets out of his pocket, hands them to
JACQUES.  Takes a bottle of Champagne out of the other
pocket and opens it.  The cork floats out of the bottle.

Above on the surface of the pool there's a splash.  JOHANA
finds a mask on the side of the pool and watches them.
Her dress is soaked by now.

ENZO pours champagne.  Courteous and grave, they clink
glasses and begin to drink.  They have already been
underwater longer than a minute.  They can't really drink
out of the glasses and ENZO offers JACQUES the bottle.
JACQUES studies the label like a connoisseur.  He drinks,
passes the bottle back to ENZO.


<b>INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
Paramedics roll two stretchers toward the elevators at
full speed.  ENZO on one, JACQUES on the other.  Both men
keep throwing up water.


<b>INT.  JACQUES'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The paramedics roll the stretcher toward the bed.
JOHANA very worried, follows them.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttTake it easy...

<b>tttttPARAMEDIC
</b>ttDon't worry, he's empty now.  He
ttneeds sleep, that's all.

The two men leave the room.

JOHANA walks over to the chair and rearranges JACQUES'
shirt and jacket which the paramedic had thrown down.
JACQUES looks like he's just had a very rough night.  He
sits up and grabs the sides of the bed, as if he were on a
moving boat.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWho won?

JOHANA turns around, furious.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWon what?  The Ass Hole Award?
ttWell, let me tell you, it's a tie!

She walks over to the bed.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttActing like a pair of two year olds!
ttYou could have died in that damn
ttpool!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttPlease move slowly, you're rocking
ttthe boat.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttLucky I was there to save you.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (seeing her wet
ttt    dress)
ttYou jumped in?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttOnly to help the medics, I assure
ttyou.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttMy wallet.

JOHANA wet, walks over to the wet clothes on the chair.
She pulls out JACQUES soaking wallet from one of the
jacket pockets.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttIt's still here.

She tries to wipe it.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttNo.  I want to show you.  Is it
ttruined?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWell, water isn't exactly the best
ttthing for pictures... Not even for
ttpictures of dolphins...

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttGive it to me.

JOHANA hands him the photograph.  He stares at it, looking
very sad.  Worried JOHANA sits down next to him.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (on the verge of
ttt    tears)
ttMy real family...
ttt   (he looks at the
ttt    picture and cries)
ttWhat kind of man has such a family?

She takes the picture out of his hands.

He is so upset that JOHANA can hardly help from crying
with him.  She sits next to him and strokes his hair.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI'm sick of never feeling at home
ttanywhere.

JOHANA takes him in her arms.  He breaks down.


<b>EXT.  HOTEL - DAWN
</b>
The early morning sun slowly lights up the water.  A yacht
has left the hotel dock.  It is moving out to sea off the
coast of TAORMINA.


<b>EXT.  YACHT - ON DECK
</b>
This is the Committee Boat for the diving competition.

On the boat, ROBERTO is worried.  He checks his watch and
finally decides to wake up his brother.  ENZO is asleep in
the fore peak, curled up on a coil of line, snoring away.
He wears his tuxedo jacket over a skimpy bathing suit.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttEnzo, wake up!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (pulled from his
ttt    dream)
ttEh?  Si!  Avanti!

He gets up on one arm.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttThe medics are looking all over for
ttyou.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (irritated)
ttI'm meditating, can't you see?
ttJacques does two hours of yoga
ttbefore going down.  I can take a
ttfive minute nap, can't I?

The boat stops.  The anchor is thrown over board.

The sailors, technicians and officials are getting ready
for the competition.  Today is ENZO'S turn to dive.  A man
is hooking a plaque indicating the depth (324 feet) onto a
lead disk which he heaves into the water on a cable.


<b>INT.  YACHT - DOCTOR'S CABIN - DAY
</b>
A medic is bending over ENZO, taking his blood pressure.

ROBERTO pulls the tuxedo jacket down.  The doctor puts a
blood pressure band around ENZO'S upper arm, pumps it up.
He listens with his stethoscope.

<b>tttttDOCTOR
</b>ttMr. Molinari, I'm terribly sorry but
ttI cannot allow you to dive in such
ttan advanced state of exhaustion.

ENZO jumps to his feet, grabs the doctor by his lapels,
lifts him in the air.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (outraged)
ttWhat do you know about the sea?
ttHuh?  Nothing!  So you just put your
tttubes and tin cans away.  The sea is
ttmine!  I know when she is ready for
ttme and when she isn't.  And today,
ttshe is ready.  Understand?

<b>tttttDOCTOR
</b>ttYou dive at your own risk.  You're
ttbeen warned.

ENZO smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttBrave.


<b>EXT.  YACHT - ON DIVING PLATFORM
</b>
It's a large float, rigged to the stern of the Committee
Boat.  ROBERTO and an assistant help ENZO down the swim
ladder to the platform.  He's wearing a wet suit and fins.
He flip-flops to the end of the platform.

ROBERTO hands him his mask.  The goggles are filled with
polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible.
Only two pinholes to see through.  The mask fits tightly
over his nose.  When ENZO puts it on, he looks like an
astonished insect.  ENZO breathes faster and faster.
ROBERTO holds the wire controlling the weighted diving
apparatus.  ENZO crosses himself, takes a last long gulp
of air.

ROBERTO releases the weight.  It sinks and drags ENZO
down, he quickly disappears into the dark water...


<b>BLACK AND WHITE
</b>
But this is JACQUES as he was a child.  He swims along the
bottom, finds and picks up a gold coin.  We can see its
ancient markings, a youth on a dolphin.

JACQUES looks up.  In front of him is a dolphin, floating
vertically, still, apparently just watching.  JACQUES
isn't scared anymore.  But every time he swims toward the
dolphin, it moves further away.  It finally disappears.


<b>INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - DAY
</b>
He sits bolt upright in bed, awakened by his dream.  He
looks around the room, trying to get his bearings.

JOHANA is asleep in a chair across the room.  On the wall
behind her, her last nights dress is drying on a hanger.
She's wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep.

JACQUES finally awake from his dream, sees JOHANA
sleeping.  He walks over to her, touches her shoulder.
She wakes up, starts out of the chair.  She grabs the
blanket to cover herself, and in doing so, a book falls on
the floor.  It's one of his.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYou scared me!

JACQUES picks up the book.  JOHANA smiles.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttJust checking up on your family.
ttt   (then embarrassed)
ttI guess I was drunker than I thought
ttand the idea of going back to my
tthotel in a wet dress... Well...

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (getting up)
ttI'd better get back now.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttYou... You wouldn't want to spend
ttthe day with me?

She sits back in her chair, amazed that he would even ask.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (self conscious)
tt... No?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttNo?  Huh?
ttt   (she says "No" as if
ttt    she had asked the
ttt    question)
ttYes, of course!!


<b>EXT.  MARINELAND - TAORMINA - DAY
</b>
JACQUES and JOHANA enter the dolphinarium.  JOHANA is
wearing an old pair of JACQUES SHORTS along with an
oversized T-shirt and rolled up sweater.  She seems quite
pleased with her new attire.

JACQUES and JOHANA walk straight through MARINELAND and
head toward the dolphin pool.  It's pretty crowded, mostly
kids.

The dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the
pool.  The trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool
and getting absolutely no reaction.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWhat's the matter?

<b>tttttTRAINER
</b>ttI don't understand.  We've tried for
tttwo days.  They won't eat.  They
ttwon't perform.  It's since we got
ttthe new one.

<b>CLOSE ON DOLPHIN
</b>
surfacing.  It thrusts its head over the edge of the pool,
looks to JACQUES and SPEAKS.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttIs she the new one?

Surprised, the trainer nods.

JOHANA looks over at JACQUES then at the dolphin.  She
doesn't understand.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttHow can you tell it's a female?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>tt... The way she moves.

Three other dolphins gather around the one that JACQUES is
patting.

JACQUES is staring at the female dolphin.  It looks like
the animal is trying to tell him something.  Suddenly the
dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the
pool.


<b>UNDERWATER - DOLPHIN POOL
</b>
JACQUES hangs onto the dolphin's muzzle.  Let's it pull
him along.  The dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool,
and pulls JACQUES to the bottom.  The other dolphins
circle above.


<b>EXT.  DOLPHIN POOL - DAY
</b>
JACQUES pops up.  As he does, three dolphins leap in the
air behind him.  JOHANA walks closer to the pool.  She is
so excited by what JACQUES is doing, she finally falls
into the pool.

After a while, JACQUES gets out of the pool and helps
JOHANA out.

<b>tttttTRAINER
</b>ttDid you ever think of trying the
ttpublic pool?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttHe's a dolphin specialist.

<b>tttttTRAINER
</b>ttIn that case what's wrong with the
ttnew one?  Is she sick or not.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (taking his time to
ttt    answer)
ttNot the way you mean.

<b>tttttTRAINER
</b>ttWhat am I supposed to do?  Do I call
ttthe dealer...?  The investment, you
ttunderstand... I certainly am
ttentitled to complain!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttIt's going to cost you more than you
ttthink!

JACQUES turns around and walks off.  JOHANA catches up
with him.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttShe's not like the others.  She
ttcan't stand to be away from the sea.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (impressed)
ttHow do you know that?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (stopping)
ttI don't know, I just feel it.


<b>INT.  HALL - HOTEL - DAY
</b>
JACQUES and JOHANA are walking across the corridor.

ENZO walks up to them, followed by his tribe.  Everybody
is congratulating him.

ROBERTO is screaming, MAMMA MOLINARI is crying.  ENZO
smiles as he talks back to them.  He sees JACQUES.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (screaming)
ttAh!  Jacques!

ENZO grabs hold of his shoulders.  JACQUES and JOHANA are
completely soaked.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttDon't be sad, I only took back what
ttwas mine.

He gives JACQUES the diving plaque, it reads 280 feet.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttHere, it's a present.

JOHANA and JACQUES smile at each other.  JACQUES has won
his bet.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (touched)
tt... Thank you.

ENZO slaps him on the shoulder.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to Johana)
ttTonight we're having a little party
ttamong ourselves.  8 o'clock in my
ttsuite?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttOkay.

ENZO walks off then turns back toward them.  He whispers
in JACQUES' ear.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttTell me... Can you explain why you
ttare soaking wet?

A beat.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>tt... We're in training.

ENZO walks off.


<b>INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
Three formally dressed officials are waiting in front of
one of the hotel rooms.  One of them holds a medal in his
hand, a glass of champagne in the other.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttt   (through the door)
ttMr. Roberto, tell your brother to be
ttreasonable.  Everyone is waiting for
tthim upstairs.  The photographers are
ttthere, the press...

<b>tttttROBERTO (O.S.)
</b>ttHe can't, he's indisposed.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttt   (trying to keep his
ttt    calm)
ttShall we call a doctor?

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttNo, it's okay.  Mamma is going to
tttry something.

JACQUES and JOHANA walk up from the other side of the hall
and stop in front of the same door.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttMr. Mayol, help us.  He refuses to
ttreceive his medal and everybody is
ttwaiting for him up there.  We
ttalready have problems with the press
ttbecause of the danger, and if we
ttdon't even have the divers help...!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (dubious)
tt... I'll do my best.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttThat's very kind of you.

JACQUES knocks on the door.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttIt's Jacques... Mayol!

A beat.  Then ENZO opens the door himself.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttJacques!  My friend!  Come on in!

The officials look at each other baffled.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttMr. Enzo Molinari, allow me to
ttimpress upon you the importance of
ttyour attending the Award Ceremony...
ttFor the press...

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (loosing his temper)
ttI think my brother told you I was
ttindisposed, that should do it, no?
ttI'm allowed to be indisposed, right?
ttSo, you just tell the press that the
tt"big" Enzo Molinari, overwhelmed by
tthis inspiring descent to 324 feet,
ttwill not be able to receive this
tttrinket because he is...

He looks inquisitively at the three men.  ENZO looses his
temper.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttBecause he is?!

<b>tttttONE OF THE THREE MEN
</b>tt... Indisposed.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttBrave!

He slams the door in their face.


<b>INT.  HOTEL - ENZO'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttTell me, why don't you go and get
ttyour medal?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttBecause pasta should be eaten "Al
ttDente".  So the trinket will just
tthave to wait a bit.

ENZO takes JACQUES by the shoulder.  Inside his room is
absolute chaos:  dancing, singing, eating.  Wet suits hung
out to dry everywhere.  MAMMA MOLINARI is whipping up
mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the
middle of the room.  A lot of smoke... steam... color...
noise... All of Italy crammed into a few square feet.

JOHANA taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner
of the room.  JACQUES walks over and sits down at her
side.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to Mamma)
ttMamma!  La pasta?!

<b>tttttMAMMA MOLINARI
</b>ttArrivo!  Arrivo!

She points at ROBERTO who is taking forever to grate the
cheese.  ENZO grabs the guitar from his other brother's
hands and starts playing.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>tt... It's easy.  You go down.  You
ttcome up.
ttt   (to Johana)
tt... Right, Johana?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttCongratulations, Enzo.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttDon't you agree, Jacques?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>tt... You always were the best.

ENZO laughs then sees his mother.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttAh!  La pasta!

ENZO starts singing in Italian.  MAMMA MOLINARI serves the
pasta, ROBERTO follows her around, sprinkling his cheese
on the plates.  She serves JOHANA a huge plate of pasta,
enough for three giants.

<b>tttttMAMMA MOLINARI
</b>ttt   (with a smile)
ttBuon appetito, Signorina!

JOHANA who isn't even hungry, grins uncertainly.  JACQUES
has walked up to ENZO.  He doesn't dare ask his question.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttWhat's the matter?  You still have a
ttbunch of things to ask me?  You want
ttto know the price of tea in China of
tthow we landed on the moon?  Is that
ttit?

ENZO laughs.  JACQUES is serious.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttNo, I have to ask you a favor...
ttt   (a beat)
ttYou're the only one who'll
ttunderstand.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (seriously)
tt... I'm listening.


<b>INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttttMAMMA MOLINARI
</b>ttTutto va bene?

The three officials are eating pasta, plates on their
knees.  Their mouths are too full to speak, they nod
enthusiastically.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttt   (mouth full)
ttGracie mille, chignora.

MAMMA MOLINARI smiles and slams the door.


<b>INT.  FIAT - NIGHT
</b>
JACQUES is driving, JOHANA sits beside him.  ENZO crammed
in the back seat, very uncomfortably, because of a
stretcher which takes up all the space.

They are dressed as they were at ENZO'S party.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (leaning forward)
ttHey!  Will you slow down!  When did
ttyou learn how to drive?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttDriving isn't the problem, it's
ttremembering the right road.

JACQUES runs a red light.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttAnd the lights!  Running lights,
ttstealing stretchers...!  You'll have
ttus in jail.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttEnzo, stop bitching, will you?


<b>EXT.  MARINELAND PARKING LOT - FIAT - NIGHT
</b>
They get out of the car.  JACQUES starts to change into
his swimming trunks.  ENZO shakes his head, can't believe
he's really come along.  He laughs and starts undressing.


<b>INT./ EXT.  FIAT - STREET TAORMINA - NIGHT
</b>
It's a very narrow street.  The car moves down it quickly.
JACQUES drives.  The back seat is now occupied by the
dolphin.  Its nose and tail protruding through the
windows.

JOHANA is in the front seat, turned around, spraying the
dolphin with a watering can.


<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT
</b>
They have driven to the public beach.  They slowly lower
the stretcher into the water.  The dolphin, leaving the
stretcher, swims around a little but won't go away.

He won't leave JACQUES.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (moved)
ttYou can't stay here!  Come on!  Go
ttaway!

JACQUES swims off with her for a while.

ENZO walks back toward the car with the stretcher.

JOHANA, standing by the water looks at JACQUES and the
dolphin who are swimming off together.

JACQUES keeps splashing the dolphin as they swim.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou can stop that now, she has all
ttthe water she needs.

JACQUES cannot get rid of the dolphin.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttAll right, we did it.  Let's go back
ttto the party.

JACQUES and the dolphin can't seem to part.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttJust one minute.

JOHANA is worried, she walks up to ENZO who goes back into
the water and takes JACQUES by the arm.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttJacques, the dolphin is home now.
ttAnd that's where we're going.  Come
tton!  Hurry up now.  Our girlfriend
ttis freezing over there.

The dolphin starts swimming off.  JACQUES follows ENZO
half-heartedly.


<b>EXT.  JOHANA'S PENSION - NIGHT
</b>
ENZO stops the FIAT in front of the pension.  The three of
them get out.  ENZO hasn't bothered to dress.

JOHANA heads for the gate, she obviously has no desire of
leaving JACQUES.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWell, good night, then...

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou going to sleep here, all by
ttyourself?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYes...

She looks over at the pension, having a hard time
concealing her lack of enthusiasm.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>tt... It's a comfortable place.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttSinister is what I'd call it...!
ttOurs is so much cheerful!  Why don't
ttyou come and stay with me... There's
ttplenty of room in my suite.

<b>tttttJOHANA

ttThe Mamma's there too.

ttYes, the Mamma is is there.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttGood night Enzo, Good night Jacques.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttGood night.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to Jacques)
ttYou don't need a stretcher to take
tther with you.  You know that, don't
ttyou?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttThe dolphins aren't the only ones
ttwho don't feel very good sometimes.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttLeave it alone, Enzo, it's okay.

She rings the bell for the concierge, then looks back at
<b>JACQUES.
</b>
<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttCan I come watch you dive tomorrow?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (lost)
ttUh... Yes, of course!

The concierge comes out and opens the iron gate for her.
JOHANA disappears into the parc.  ENZO turns to JACQUES.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou really do have a few things to
ttlearn about women!


<b>EXT.  SEA - DAY
</b>
The sun is rising on a rough sea.  The Committee Boat is
anchored in the open sea, 600 feet above the sea bed.


<b>EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - BAY OF TAORMINA - DAY
</b>
JACQUES who is on the foredeck of a boat at sea has just
laid a towel down before him.  He's suited up, sitting in
the lotus position, staring straight ahead, clearly self-
hypnotized.

JOHANA, NOVELLI, and other officials are in the stern of
the boat watching last minute preparations.

The scuba divers in brightly colored wetsuits and
aqualungs, flop out onto the diving platform, plunge into
the water, disappear.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWhat are they for?

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttThey're paramedics.  They wait at
tt180 feet.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (just checking)
ttIf there was a problem, they could
ttdo something right?

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttOf course, that's what they're for.

JOHANA sees scuba divers with weird air tanks.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (pointing)
tt... And those?

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttThose are the divers who go down 300
ttto 330 feet.  They dive with a
ttHelium-oxygen mixture.  At that
ttdepth, compressed air is too
ttdangerous because it contains carbon
ttdioxide.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWhat's that little air bottle on the
ttmachine?

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttThat isn't for the divers actually.
ttIt's for the balloon.  It blows up
ttand pulls the diver up like an
ttelevator.  Without it, with the
ttpressure at the bottom, the diver
ttwould just stay pinned to the sea
ttbed.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (shocked)
ttBut doesn't Jacques dive without
ttanything?

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttYes... It's magic.


<b>INT.  BOAT - DAY - LATER
</b>
On the boat, NOVELLI checks his watch.  JACQUES comes out
of his room.  He's dressed to dive.  He ignores everyone
as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform.  He
seems to be in another world.  All sounds coming to him
are drowned out.


<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY
</b>
JACQUES sits in the diver's slot.  Opens his eyes slowly
and looks around.  He puts his flippers on, an assistant
stands at his side.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
The figures on the platform are vague, the VOICES are
GARBLED and incomprehensible.  Moving almost in slow
motion he raises three fingers.

<b>tttttTECHNICIAN
</b>ttTre minuti!

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive.
They disappear one by one into the blue.

JACQUES uses contact lenses instead of a mask.  He puts
them in, and now, his view of the world is as distorted as
his hearing... bodies deform... sounds fade...

Already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his
system, he moves into another reality altogether... seems
to empty himself out.

<b>tttttTECHNICIAN
</b>ttDue minuti!

JACQUES fills a small tube with water.  Pours it into his
nostrils... tilts his head... then lets it run out... He
puts on his gloves... all his movements are slow, he seems
to be operating in a different time zone... He seems
unable to take his eyes off the water.


<b>EXT.  END OF DIVING PLATFORM - DAY
</b>
<b>tttttTECHNICIAN
</b>ttUno minuto!

JACQUES puts his nose clip on.  He puts his hand on the
gueuse.  Closes his eyes and inhales slowly.  Then he
takes a sudden last breath, nods, the technician releases
the gueuse and in one flashing movement, he disappears.


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
The gueuse slides down the cable.  JACQUES hangs on like a
ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down.

Above him, the boat disappears from sight.

He moves faster and faster... through a sea that looks
like a cloudy sky.  The light fades rapidly around him.

Below, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night.
JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds.  Turns the
brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down.

The medics are waiting for him there.  They take his
pulse.  Check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the
bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around
them...

JACQUES closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he
releases the brake on the gueuse.  Plunges further, this
time into pitch black.

Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom.  He
reaches it and the dark diver moves to him.  JACQUES
brakes his machine.  Moving very slowly, turns his body
right side up.  Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to
take the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle
of the gesture.

The dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb and
forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear.  JACQUES
does not respond.  The diver repeats the signal.  JACQUES
does not respond.

The diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder... a beat... and
then JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay.
Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle
of the balloon.

The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him.  The
balloon inflates.  JACQUES hangs on... lets it carry him
up.

At the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the the
balloon.  With a burst of speed, it darts toward the
surface.

JACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish... He's
getting warm now... He closes his eyes.

Passes the medical control without stopping... without
even seeing it like someone asleep.

He's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air.
JACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter.

The silhouette of the boat comes back into view.  60 feet
to go.


<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY
</b>
In slow motion JACQUES' hand holding the plaque breaks out
of the water followed by his arm, in one continuous
movement, his shoulders and head.

He gasps for air.

A trickle of blood comes from his nose.

Flashbulbs flicker, spectators cheer.


<b>EXT.  OPEN SEA - A DOLPHIN
</b>
The dolphin, the one rescued last night, leaps into the
air, in perfect harmony with JACQUES' triumph.


<b>EXT.  DOLPHINARIUM
</b>
The dolphins in the dolphinarium leap into the air at the
exact same moment.

The trainer doesn't understand what's going on.


<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY
</b>
JACQUES falls back into the water.  Two divers run over
and pull him up onto the dock.

JACQUES seems completely dazed, almost in a trance.  He
slowly comes to and starts screaming louder and louder.
It is the scream of his body in need of the surface,
reality and the feel of the land.

JOHANA is terrified.  She can hardly breathe.  Everybody
applauds.


<b>EXT.  HOTEL DOCK - DAY
</b>
JACQUES and JOHANA walk down the gangway.  NOVELLI has
lead the way and the news has been spread.

JACQUES looks very weak and punchy.

JOHANA holds him up.

The spectators applaud as he goes by.  Intrigued, JACQUES
looks at them all.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (excited)
ttJacques, listen to the applause.

He doesn't respond.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (trying to keep up)
ttJacques, you set a world record.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI did?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttAren't you happy?  Don't you feel
ttproud...?  I feel proud and all I
ttdid was watch.

He is staring at her, he's returning to the real world.
Slowly he smiles.

She grabs hold of his arm and gives him a proud kiss on
the mouth.  JACQUES is a little stunned.


<b>EXT.  TERRACE - SWIMMING POOL - DAY
</b>
ENZO walks into the hotel, his arms filled with packages.
He sees JACQUES and JOHANA.  From the look on his face we
can tell he knows that JACQUES has beaten his record.  He
deliberately puts on a huge smile as he walks over to
them.


<b>INT.  TERRACE - SWIMMING POOL
</b>
<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttCongratulations Jacques!  It's
ttwonderful!  Wonderful!

He drops his packages on the bar and gives Jacques a big
hug.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttI'm happy for you!

He kisses him and starts handing out his presents.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to Jacques)
ttHere...
ttt   (to Johana)
ttHere...

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWhat is it?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttLittle presents, nothing much... I
ttknew it, I just knew it!  Look here!

He holds up his arm:  he is wearing two watches.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttRoberto's watch!  I won it!  He bet
ttthat you couldn't beat me!

JACQUES opens his present.  It's a little ceramic dolphin.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou still collect them?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou don't have that one, do you?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttNo.  Thank you.  It's really
ttbeautiful.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttOh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told
ttRoberto "He's very good that little
ttFrenchman, very good".  I lost my
tttitle but I won a watch!

JOHANA has opened her package.  It's a big plate with a
text engraved on it.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttIs it a poem?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttNo, it's the recipe for spaghetti
tt"Frutti del mare".
ttt   (to Jacques)
ttYou see I was right in getting you
ttout here.  You're a world champion,
ttmy friend!

JACQUES has opened the last small package.  It's a
measuring tape.  He looks at it without understanding.

ENZO explains:

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttIt's a measuring tape.

He grabs hold of the tape and lets it roll to the ground.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou see this is your record, three
ttfeet more than mine!  Looking at it
ttfrom here, it doesn't look like
ttmuch, does it?

JACQUES looks at him without saying a word.

ENZO hands him the measuring tape.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttKeep your little measuring tape, my
ttfriend, it will be a nice souvenir
ttwhen I beat you next.

ENZO taps his shoulder and smiles.


<b>INT.  ELEVATOR ASCENDING - JACQUES - JOHANA
</b>
They're locked in a long kiss.  He untucks the bottom of
her shirt and slides his hands under it.


<b>INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - TWILIGHT
</b>
They're in bed, making love in their fashion.  Moonlight
shines in the silver sea.  In the background are the
lights of the bay of TAORMINA.

<b>LATER
</b>
JACQUES is in bed with JOHANA.  They are both asleep.
Suddenly, he sits up, as he always does after his
recurrent dream.

He's wide awake, looks over at her sleeping.  She sleeps
peacefully like a baby.  Quietly, gently, he eases out of
bed and walks to the open window.

He stands on the balcony, staring at the sea.  Then in the
distance in the moonlight, a dolphin leaps out of the
water, once, twice, a third time.

JACQUES laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down
next to JOHANA.  She is still sound asleep.


<b>EXT.  HOTEL - PIER - NIGHT
</b>
JACQUES quickly gets into one of his diving suits.  He
puts on his flippers.  The dolphin is still jumping in and
out of the water.  JACQUES jumps off the pier and swims
over to her.


<b>INT.  JACQUES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
JOHANA rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep.

JACQUES' absence wakes her.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttJacques?

She gets up and walks over to the balcony.  She doesn't
see anything.


<b>EXT.  PIER - NIGHT
</b>
JOHANA walks down the pier and notices the little pile of
clothes JACQUES has left behind.  She looks around but
still can't see anything.  She decides to sit next to the
pile of clothes, and waits, her eyes riveted to the sea.


<b>EXT.  PIER - DAWN
</b>
The sky has just begun to light up again.  JOHANA is still
sitting next to the pile of clothes.

She is wearing JACQUES' sweater.  She looks sad, yet
serene.  The look of a woman who has been thinking over
the situation and who has made up her mind.

Tired, JACQUES swims back to the pier.  It looks as if he
has come out of nowhere.

He is exhausted.  He takes off his flippers and gets up
onto the pier in front of JOHANA.  He looks at her, a
little surprised to find her there.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (warm)
ttWhat are you doing here?

She answers in a far away voice, with the same serene
sadness.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI'm going to leave, Jacques.

Dripping with water, he sits down next to her.  His face
is drawn from fatigue.  She continues.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI'm going back home.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWhy?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttBecause one shouldn't fall in love
ttwith creatures from the sea.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI'm not from the sea... I don't
ttunderstand what you're talking
ttabout.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYes you do.  You know exactly what
ttI'm talking about.  You're afraid I
ttwant to hold onto you, and I do,
ttbut you're not ready... at least not
ttfor me.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttBut it's not true, I feel good with
ttyou... It feels right...

She looks at him for a moment, then takes his face in her
hands and rests it on her bosom, as if a small child.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI've got to get back to the hotel...
ttand get my suitcase packed.


<b>INT.  TRAIN STATION - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY
</b>
The train station faces the sea.  JACQUES and JOHANA are
standing on the platform, amid others.  In the distance we
hear the rumble and whistle of a train.

JOHANA gets on the train.  The station master blows his
whistle.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWill... will we see each other
ttagain?

JOHANA'S eyes are filled with tears.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttTake good care of yourself, Jacques.

The train starts pulling out of the station.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWhere can I call you?  Johana, tell
ttme where can I call you?

JOHANA doesn't answer.  JACQUES stands helplessly in the
station, his eyes filled with tears.


<b>INT.  ENZO'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
ENZO opens the door of his suite.  His hair is messed up,
he's got "sheet prints" on his face and is wearing the top
of a diving suit.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttCan I come in?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttNo problem, I enjoy talking in my
ttsleep.

ENZO walks back into the apartment and crashes on the bed.
He's lying on his stomach.  JACQUES walks in and lets
himself drop in a chair.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttWake me up at 11:00.

ENZO closes his eyes.  JACQUES looks over at the clock, it
says 11:25.  JACQUES doesn't say anything and stares
blankly out of the window.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (opening one eye)
ttHmmm!  Something wrong?

JACQUES doesn't answer.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttIs it the girl?

JACQUES stares out the window.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttDid she leave?

No answer.  ENZO gets up and sits on the side of the bed.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttHey!  I'm going to take care of you!
ttI've got this job, on an oil rig, no
ttsweat!  I'm taking you along... Come
tton!  Get your bags packed!  You're
ttcoming with me, I tell you!

He pats him on the back.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttWe'll make a great team, the two of
ttus.  You'll see!


<b>EXT.  OIL DRILLING PLATFORM - AT SEA - DAY
</b>
The platform shines in the morning light.

There are several stories of crew housing and offices
above the deck.  Long steel legs disappear into the
swelling slate-gray ocean.  We hear WHOP-WHOP-WHOP of a
helicopter.


<b>EXT.  HELICOPTER - PLATFORM
</b>
The helicopter is landing.  Crewmen rush to secure it to
the oil rig's deck.  Doors open and two passengers get
off:  JACQUES and ENZO.  They each carry a duffel bag of
personal belongings.  They're both wearing fluorescent
diving suits.

The DRILLING SUPERINTENDENT comes to meet them.

<b>tttttSUPERINTENDENT
</b>ttMayol, Molinari...?

They nod.

<b>tttttSUPERINTENDENT
</b>ttWe've been waiting for you for three
ttdays.  Goddamnit!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttIs that the way you talk to the best
ttdiver in the world...?  And to his
ttfriend Jacques Mayol!

The SUPERINTENDENT smiles sourly, and gestures to a
crewman.

<b>tttttSUPERINTENDENT
</b>ttShow them their quarters.

Five minutes later, JACQUES and ENZO are following the
crewman.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (whispering)
ttHe doesn't like us.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttSo what!?  His job is to hand out
ttthe paychecks.  And he does that
ttvery well, let me tell you.


<b>INT.  DIVING CAPSULE - DAY
</b>
The diving capsule, suspended by cables, begins its
descent through a trap door in the deck.  It plunges into
the sea.

The three men in the capsule are:  JACQUES, ENZO and the
tough looking CAPSULE COMMANDER NOIREUTER, who is much too
professional for ENZO'S tastes.

ENZO watches through a porthole while the COMMANDER
concentrates on the control console.  He runs through a
checklist of systems.  JACQUES responds with a "check" as
he verifies each one.  ENZO is already bored and fed up by
the procedures.

JACQUES is lost in thought, they don't look cheerful.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (suddenly)
ttYou still thinking about her?

JACQUES doesn't answer.  ENZO goes on.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttDon't think about her anymore!  Let
ttme tell you, you're just making
ttyourself unhappy!  There are so many
ttwomen in the world!

He takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and
stares at NOIREUTER.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttPlenty of women everywhere right?

<b>tttttNOIREUTER
</b>ttt   (coldly)
ttSmoking is absolutely forbidden.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttIt isn't lit yet.

<b>tttttNOIREUTER
</b>ttYou shouldn't even carry cigarettes
tton board!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttListen we're not supposed to piss
tteither but that doesn't stop you
ttfrom carrying "it" on board?!

<b>tttttNOIREUTER
</b>ttt   (stubborn)
ttThe rules are the rules.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (checking out this
ttt    creature)
tt... What's your name again?

<b>tttttNOIREUTER
</b>ttNoireuter.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttAnd where did you say you were from?

<b>tttttNOIREUTER
</b>ttI didn't say...
ttt   (contemptuous)
ttBrussels!

ENZO smiles sardonically, shaking his head very slowly.
The COMMANDER'S answer explains it all.


<b>INT.  DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</b>
A technician is overlooking the capsule descent on a
video screen.

The SUPERINTENDENT watches over the technician's shoulder.

<b>tttttTECHNICIAN
</b>ttThey're at 450 feet.

ENZO, a cigarette dangling from his lips, looks through
the porthole.

The technician fiddles with a few knobs.

<b>tttttTECHNICIAN
</b>ttMinus 800 feet.  End of descent.


<b>INT.  DIVING CAPSULE
</b>
The diving capsule ends its descent.  The COMMANDER turns
to ENZO and JACQUES who is still staring out the porthole.

<b>tttttNOIREUTER
</b>ttt   (with a Mickey Mouse
ttt    voice)
ttYou have enough air for 15 minutes.

ENZO bursts out laughing.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (with Donald Ducks
ttt    voice)
ttWhat's with the voice?

<b>tttttNOIREUTER
</b>ttIt's nothing.  It's just the helium,
ttbecause of the air pressure.

<b>tttttENZO

ttAnd... does the voice come back?

</b>ttFor others, yes... For you, who

ttTry speaking to me?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (with Daffy Ducks
ttt    voice)
ttI don't find this funny.  We were
tthaving a serious conversation.

ENZO and JACQUES burst out laughing.  They keep these same
voice till the end of the scene.

ENZO pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to Jacques)
ttHere, give me your finger.

ENZO taps a drop onto JACQUES' finger, then on his own.
Then NOIREUTER blows up.

<b>tttttNOIREUTER
</b>ttt   (in a panic)
ttIs that alcohol?  Are you out of
ttyour mind?  Alcohol is strictly
ttforbidden.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (loosing his temper)
ttHey!  D'you have any other
ttcomplaints?  Just make a list and
ttwe'll stick it on the porthole!
ttOkay?

ENZO pours a second drop on his own finger.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttGo on, suck your finger.

JACQUES hesitates.  ENZO has no qualms about it and sucks
his own finger.  NOIREUTER is petrified.

<b>tttttNOIREUTER
</b>ttAre you crazy?  At this pressure?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttIt's very deep down here.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttCome on, suck your finger, you'll be
ttseeing mermaids everywhere!

JACQUES, convinced sucks his finger too.  ENZO smiles.
The alcohol has an immediate effect on them.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to Jacques)
ttA thousand commanders and we get a
ttBelgian from Alcoholic's Anonymous.


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
ENZO gets out of the diving capsule, head first.
He is connected to the capsule by a number of cables.

JACQUES, who follows him, gets completely tangled up in
them.  They are both hilariously drunk.


<b>INT.  DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM

The SUPERINTENDENT hears them laughing through the control
room speakers.  He flips a communication switch.

<b>tttttSUPERINTENDENT
</b>ttCan you hear me?  What's going on?
ttt   (to the technician)
ttAre you sure you're on the right
ttchannel?

The technician nods back to him.


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
The two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed
to be working on.  They have their arms around each other
and are dancing.

NOIREUTER watches them through the porthole.  He shakes
his head in complete disbelief.


<b>INT.  CONTROL ROOM

We hear the two friends humming the tune of a Viennese
waltz.

JOHANA breaks into a wide grin.

<b>INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - DAY
</b>
DUFFY is at his desk.  His lunch is spread out in front of
him.  Outside the window, the window-washers are eating
their lunch too.  JOHANA hurries in.

<b>tttttDUFFY
</b>ttGood afternoon.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (agitated)
ttI came to make a clean breast of
tteverything... the whole business.

<b>tttttDUFFY
</b>ttt   (bluffing, with his
ttt    mouth full of
ttt    sandwich)
ttYes.  Of course.  Very wise.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (in a rush)
ttRemember when I went to Italy and
ttcanceled the policy on the new
ttstadium.  Well, we weren't being
ttcheated by the Mafia or anybody
ttexcept maybe by me...
ttt   (she sees the window-
ttt    washers)
tt... Do they come for lunch everyday?
ttI really went on my own business, to
ttsee a man that I happen to be in

ttbut I'm sorry about the policy and
ttI'll be happy to make up the money
ttthe company didn't get... of course
ttjust now I don't have...
ttt   (she checks a note
ttt    she's holding)
ttOne million, four hundred and ten
ttthousand dollars.  But if you were
ttto dock my salary, say, twenty
ttdollars a week, in a few hundred
ttyears we'd be even... and I think
ttthis is where you fire me?

<b>tttttDUFFY
</b>ttt   (swallowing sandwich)
ttYou're right.  You're fired.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWill that interfere with my getting
ttmaternity leave?  I'm pregnant.

<b>tttttDUFFY
</b>ttThe Italian, I presume?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttNo.  He's French, he was just in
ttItaly for the competition.

<b>tttttDUFFY
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttHe seems to have won it.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so
tthappy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest
ttpregnant fired person in the world!

She starts to leave... calls out to the window-washers.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttBon appetit and Adieu!


<b>INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
JOHANA stares out of the bay window of her Manhattan
apartment.  Hesitant, she walks around her telephone.
Finally she makes up her mind, picks up her address book
and dials the number.

<b>tttttJACQUES (V.O.)
</b>ttHello?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttIt's me... Johana.


<b>INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT
</b>
JACQUES is on the telephone, in front of a little window
overlooking the sea.  He is very glad to hear her voice.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttHow are you?


<b>INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI got fired.

<b>tttttJACQUES (V.O.)
</b>tt... That's funny... I had this job
ttwith Enzo... we got fired too.

JOHANA'S face lights up with a huge smile.

<b>tttttttt    DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>LATER
</b>
JOHANA is still on the phone, sitting in front of the bay
window.  Day is dawning.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (looking out at the
ttt    skyline)
ttIt's getting light out.

<b>tttttJACQUES (V.O.)
</b>ttHere, it's getting dark.

JOHANA smiles.  She stretches, lies down on the carpeted
floor.  JACQUES seems to have gone through all topics of
conversation.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI've been thinking about you a lot,
ttyou know...

JOHANA is by now completely stretched out on the floor.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttSo have I.
ttt   (a beat)
tt... Hello?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI'm still here.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWell, then, talk to me some more.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>tt... It's hard you know.  You're so
ttfar away and I don't know what else
ttto say.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttThen, tell me a story.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttUh... Ah!  A story?

He turns around and sits on the window sill, his feet
dangling in mid air.

He looks at the sea, seeking inspiration.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttDo you know how it is?
ttt   (starting again)
ttDo you know what you're supposed to
ttdo to meet a mermaid?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (with a smile)
ttNo... tell me.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttYou go down to the bottom of the
ttsea, where the water isn't even blue
ttanymore, where the sky is only a
ttmemory... and you float there,
ttquietly, quietly and stay there...
ttand you decide that you will die for
ttthem... Only then do they start
ttcoming out.  They come and greet you
ttand they judge the love you have for
ttthem... If it's sincere.  If it's
ttpure... They will be with you and
tttake you away forever.

JOHANA listens with the abandon of a child being put to
sleep.


<b>INT.  JACQUES' ROOM - ANTIBES
</b>
The sun hits the roof tops.  The sea is sparkling.
The phone rings on the window sill.  JACQUES answers.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttHello?

<b>tttttJOHANA (V.O.)
</b>ttIt's me again.

JACQUES smiles.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (after a silence)
ttI'm being a pain, huh?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>tt... Not at all.

<b>tttttJOHANA (V.O.)
</b>ttYou sure?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttAbsolutely positive.

<b>tttttJOHANA (V.O.)
</b>ttOkay.  In that case... I'm at the
ttairport in Nice.

JACQUES doesn't know what to say.  He looks around him,
can't figure out what to do.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (lost)
ttOkay... huh, I'll be right over.


<b>INT.  AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
JOHANA is standing in front of the airport.

JACQUES sees her.  They smile shyly at each other.


<b>EXT.  STREET - NICE - OPPOSITE THE NEGRESCO HOTEL
</b>
JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting in the back of a taxi.  The
driver stops in front of the hotel.

<b>tttttDRIVER
</b>ttt   (loud)
ttThe Carlton!  Enjoy your siesta.

JACQUES and JOHANA look at each other.


<b>INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY
</b>
The room is in semi-darkness, despite the blazing sunlight
coming through cracks in the shutters.  JACQUES and JOHANA
are making love.  JACQUES is on top of her, his whole body
covered in sweat.  The rumpled sheets and the movements of
their bodies suggest the movements of the sea.  ALL SOUNDS
are disproportionate and slightly distorted, they are
underwater...

ALL JOHANA'S reluctance has vanished.  Both of them act
like people who have never felt anything like this before.
A certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling.  An
increasing freedom.  All the muscles of their bodies
stretch to their limits.

JACQUES, progressively, finds himself disappearing.  His
image dissolves point by point... disintegrates into
unbroken blue... The effect creates the impression of
someone melting, the screen is now totally blue.

A thin, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.

From the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts
TOWARD the CAMERA.  It is JACQUES, naked, swimming out of
the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming
out of a dive.  He comes CLOSER and CLOSER to the
<b>CAMERA...
</b>
Until his head almost touches the lens...

A sudden DEAFENING NOISE... and we find JACQUES on top of
JOHANA.  He looks down at her, speechless.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (a little frightened)
ttAre you okay?

After a long beat.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>tt... I think I love you.


<b>INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - ANTIBES - DAY
</b>
JACQUES and JOHANA step out of the elevator of a 19th
century building.

JACQUES is carrying her suitcases.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWhy did you take me to the hotel, if
ttyou live here.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttYou'll understand.

JACQUES rings the door bell and sticks his key in the
door.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (surprised)
ttSomeone in there?

JACQUES nods and pushes the door open with the bags he's
carrying.  They enter a huge, very old apartment filled
with models and paintings of boats.

JACQUES leads JOHANA to the other end of the apartment.


<b>INT.  BATHROOM - ON UNCLE LOUIS (SORT OF)
</b>
It's a huge old-fashioned bathroom.  The centerpiece is a
deep ancient bathtub on faded gild feet.  There's a
rippling shadow of a body under the bath water.

JOHANA gasps.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttDon't be afraid.  It's my Uncle...
ttLouis.

He goes to the tub and pinches the end of a tube.  UNCLE
LOUIS, underwater, has been breathing through it.  LOUIS'
head pops out of the water, furious.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttAssassin!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (loud, as if speaking
ttt    to a deaf man)
ttUncle Louis, this is my friend
ttJohana.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttDid you buy the cassettes?  The
ttWagner, the Berlioz?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI brought Johana to meet you.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttAre you crazy?  I have no use for a
ttwoman!  Since my accident.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttNo, no.  Johana is visiting me.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (tentatively)
ttBonjour Monsieur... Louis.
ttt   (she looks to
ttt    Jacques)

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (whispering to
ttt    Johana)
ttUncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old
ttamazing guy, isn't he?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle
ttLouis.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttt   (to Johana)
ttDid you bring the cassettes, the
ttWagner, the Berlioz?
ttt   (pointing to Jacques)
ttThis idiot never listens to anything
ttI say.  Sometimes I wonder if he
ttisn't deaf.

LOUIS climbs out of the bathtub, and pulls on a bathrobe.
Behind him he's pulling two insulated wires out of the
bathtub.  We see that they're connected to small
underwater speakers.  As they surface, incredibly LOUD
MUSIC BLASTS:  the finale of the "1812 Overture",
(trumpets, timpani, cannons, etc...) The sound fills the
room, the apartment, and probably all of ANTIBES.


<b>INT.  DINING ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - LOUIS - LATER
</b>
The three of them are at the table.  There are a few
scraps on their plates on a threadbare lace tablecloth.

Incredibly LOUD SYMPHONIC MUSIC is PLAYING.  LOUIS is as
deaf as a fence post.

Everyone has to scream over the music.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttWhere are you from, Henrietta?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (correcting him)
ttJohana... New York.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttWhat kind of name is that?  To be
ttnamed after a city?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttHe doesn't hear too well.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (yelling)
ttI said I was from New York.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttt   (yelling at Jacques)
ttThat explains it!  The best lays are
ttfrom New York!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttUncle Louis!

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttNo, no.  It's true.  When I was in
ttNew York, oh boy!
ttt   (to Johana)
ttBefore my accident, you understand?
ttt   (then back to
ttt    Jacques)

JACQUES stands up and lowers the music.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (impatient)
ttUncle Louis!  Johana is my friend.
ttShe's come to stay with me for a
ttwhile.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttGood.  That way I'll see more of
ttyou... Where are you going to stay?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWell... here.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttt   (outraged)
ttIn my apartment?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (with a sigh)
ttIt's my apartment.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttt   (jumping up)
ttLiar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you
ttwere an orphan I nursed you at my
ttbreast.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttUncle Louis, we have a guest!

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttI'm going to put a lock on the
tttelephone.
ttt   (them calming down,
ttt    to Johana)
ttDid you bring the cassettes?


<b>INT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA
</b>
JACQUES' room looks like a diving equipment storage room
with a bed in it.  JACQUES notices JOHANA'S gaze.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (solicitously)
ttYou think it'll be all right?
ttYou'll be comfortable here?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (catching her breath)
ttIt's going to be... interesting.


<b>EXT.  PORT OF ANTIBES - DAY
</b>
JACQUES, JOHANA and ROBERTO are waiting at the port.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttt   (glancing at his
ttt    watch)
tt... It's not like him to be late.
ttOf course sometimes he doesn't show
ttup at all.  Once in Capri, he...

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (interrupting)
ttWe get the picture, Roberto.
ttt   (looks over her
ttt    shoulder)
ttJacques, I think Louis needs help.

JACQUES turns around.  UNCLE LOUIS is a few yards behind
them at a fish stand on the dock.  He's holding up an eel
and screaming at the fishmonger.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttt   (yelling)
ttTwo dollars for this!  This fish
ttwasn't caught.  It died of cancer!

JACQUES shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of
interfering.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttt   (pointing)
ttHere he comes!

A speed boat races along the water.  It's a beautiful
highly-varnished mahogany Riva.  It races into the port.
Standing at the helm, looking like Christopher Columbus
his hair brushed back by the wind, is ENZO.

Next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive
six foot, dark haired beauty.  She has a scarf over her
hair.  She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a cerise
halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long.
If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd make
Raquel Welch hide in shame.  Her stage name is BONITA
<b>MARIPOSA.
</b>
ENZO kills the THROTTLE, swings the speedboat into a
perfect landing at the dock.  ROBERTO takes the lines.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttJacques!  Johana!

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttEnzo!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttEnzo!

During all of this, everyone's attention is actually on
BONITA who is tugging at her long black hair.  They're all
awestruck except for ROBERTO.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttt   (meaning the speed
ttt    boat)
ttWhere did you get that?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (meaning Bonita)
tt"That"!  This is not a "that"...
ttThis is Bonita Mariposa, the famous
ttSpanish actress.
ttt   (whispering to
ttt    Bonita)
tt... Who is going to be careful with
ttthe varnish...
ttt   (back to Roberto)
ttAnd who has come to spend a few days
ttwith us.
ttt   (and very quickly)
ttWhere's Mamma?

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttt   (checking watch)
ttYou have eight hours before she gets
tthere.

ENZO glances at his watch and sighs with relief.  BONITA
says hello to JACQUES, kisses JOHANA.


<b>INT.  LIVING ROOM IN JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Loud classical music booms from the stereo.  The noise
pins JACQUES, ENZO and ROBERTO to their chairs.

UNCLE LOUIS gets a bottle of whiskey and serves everybody.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttHe's really going totally deaf!

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttI'm not as deaf as you are blind, my
ttboy!  You take care of your eyes,
ttI'll take care of my ears!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (laughing)
ttI'm sorry Uncle Louis.

UNCLE LOUIS pours him a whiskey.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttCome on, drink up, my boy!  It might
ttjust save us from your bullshit.

The bottle is empty.  UNCLE LOUIS goes to the kitchen.
JACQUES turns down the music, and finally hears the bell
which has been ringing.  JACQUES opens the apartment door:
it's Professor LAWRENCE.  Suit and tie and carrying a
bottle.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI'm glad you could come.  I want you
ttto meet Enzo.

ENZO and LAWRENCE shake hands.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttt   (with a smile)
ttSo you're the famous Enzo Molinari?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (with an even bigger
ttt    smile)
ttIn the flesh.  I have that honor!


<b>INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
JOHANA comes into the bathroom, closes the door, cutting
down the blaring music.  The paint is peeling off the
ceiling.

BONITA is standing under a 40 watt lamp, putting on make-
up in front of JACQUES' cracked shaving mirror.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttYou're going to live here
ttpermanently?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>tt... Maybe, if Jacques will let me
ttfix up the place a little.

JOHANA walks over to the mirror and watches BONITA put on
her make-up like a professional.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttt   (wistfully)
ttHe's shy, not like Enzo.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYes.  Not like Enzo.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttt   (putting on
ttt    eyelashes)
ttI think, he's really nice... He's a
ttfunny guy... sometimes even very
ttmoving.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (after a long
ttt    silence)
tt... I'm pregnant, Bonita!

BONITA stops working on her make-up and looks pensively at
<b>JOHANA.
</b>
<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttAre you going to keep it?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttDoes he know?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttNo.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttt   (thinking)
ttMaybe you should talk to him about
ttit.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI can't... I just don't know how
ttto...

BONITA looks at her with the same pensive look.

JOHANA goes on.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI was thinking of something kinda
ttstupid last night.  You know those
ttwomen in the greek mythology that
ttmade love with the Gods.  Take Leda
ttfor example, sleeping with Jupiter,
ttwho came to earth as a swan... Well,
ttcan you imagine Leda announcing to
tther swan "You're going to be a
ttfather, my little chick-a-dee"?

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttt   (starts laughing)
ttBut your man isn't quite a God!

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (smiles)
ttProbably not, but I still don't have
ttthe nerve to tell him.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttWell, you're going to have to tell
tthim, sometime!

Unconvinced, JOHANA nods.  She changes the subject.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttAnd you...?  Do you love Enzo?

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttt   (earnestly)
ttVery much, I think.
ttt   (a beat)
ttBut, there's going to be a problem.


<b>EXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
The "problem":  MAMMA MOLINARI sits between ENZO and
ROBERTO, looking like a malevolent storm cloud, staring
across at BONITA.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttt   (desperately)
ttMamma, calimari fritti... Zuppa de
ttpesci.  Sono buoni.

<b>tttttMAMMA MOLINARI
</b>ttt   (eyeing Bonita)
ttNothing.  I'm not hungry.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttMamma, Bonita is an actress like
ttSophia Loren, Anna Magnani...

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttt   (icy)
ttSarah Bernardt.  I sing too... a
tthell of a Carmen.  Want to hear?

<b>tttttMAMMA MOLINARI
</b>ttt   (coldly)
ttNo thank you.

There's an interminable awkward silence.  Then UNCLE LOUIS
at last finds his way to the table.  JACQUES who is too
grateful for the interruption springs to his feet.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttUncle Louis, you remember Enzo's
ttmother Signora Molinari from
ttAmorgos?

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttt   (screaming)
ttThe whale!  How could I forget?
ttAlways was something fishy about
ttthat woman!

MAMMA MOLINARI is having trouble breathing.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttWhat were Italians doing living in
ttGreece anyway?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttLouis, we were French!

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttThat's different!  What's the matter
ttwith you?

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttt   (complete panic)
ttMamma, pesce di spada?

All of them are gasping for air, trying so hard not to
laugh.

<b>tttttUNCLE LOUIS
</b>ttt   (to Mamma)
ttHey, whale!  Can you pass down the
ttsquids?

They all burst out laughing.


<b>EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY
</b>
The diving platform is out.  The competition has begun.
ENZO is at the gueuse, getting ready to dive.  ROBERTO
works around him busily.

BONITA on deck above him is making little gestures of
encouragement.  ENZO isn't amused.

Other competitors watch from the Committee Boat.

ENZO turns the handle on the gueuse, plunges into the
water.

Professor LAWRENCE, taking notes, stands a few feet away.


<b>UNDERWATER - ON ENZO
</b>
He dives down, further and further down.  He approaches
the two medics in aqualungs at the control point (210
feet).

They move toward him.


<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO
</b>
Surfacing.  Assistants help him onto the platform.
ROBERTO pulls off his fins.  ENZO rips off his mask.  He
looks furious.  He tosses the depth plaque (which proves
he is qualified) back into the water.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttA shit dive.

He looks around angrily for an official.  Sees NOVELLI.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttThose goddamned frogmen doctors
ttwaiting around at 200 feet they just
ttkill your concentration.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttThey're required by law.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (climbing off
ttt    platform)
ttThere's no law down there!  The only
ttlaw is what your lungs can take.
ttt   (to the next diver)
tt... Have fun!  They waiting for you
ttdown there, to take the temperature
ttof your ass.

He keeps on walking across the boat, runs into JACQUES,
who's just about to begin his yoga preparation.

JACQUES sees ENZO'S expression, looks concerned.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (defensively)
ttAnybody can have a bad day!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI've had many... when the sea
ttdoesn't want you.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (disgusted)
ttIt's never the sea!  It's Roberto,
ttMamma, that stupid actress... Oh
ttshit!  Jacques, what do you know?
ttGo do your Hindu exercises and don't
ttbreak my balls!

ENZO stamps into one of the cabins.


<b>INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
JOHANA is reading a child birth catalog.  She throws it
away upside down, as soon as she hears JACQUES
approaching.  JACQUES comes in and sits opposite her.  He
seems bitter.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWell, how was it?

In an involuntary gesture, JACQUES flips through the
catalog.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (sadly)
ttEnzo had a bad day.

JOHANA wonders if JACQUES will understand the presence of
the baby magazine.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (tense)
ttAnd you?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI didn't dive.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (she takes the
ttt    magazine)
ttYou'll try again tomorrow?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI don't know... it didn't feel
ttright.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.

He goes away.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYou forgot your magazine!

He hasn't heard.

JACQUES goes to the bedroom, and throws himself on the
bed.

JOHANA looks as if she had wished he'd put two and two
together.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>tt... Nothing.

<b>tttttttt    DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY
</b>
ENZO bursts out of the water.  He rips off his face mask,
throws it on the diving platform, roaring with pleasure.
He tosses the depth plague to ROBERTO.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttLet them try.


<b>INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
JOHANA opens the apartment door.  BONITA is standing
there, a suitcase in one hand.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttI wanted to say goodbye, Johana.

They kiss each other goodbye.

JOHANA is very uncomfortable.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYou're leaving?

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttYes...
ttt   (she hands her a
ttt    note)
ttCould you please give this to Enzo.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttOf course.

BONITA grabs the note back and tears it up.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttIt's no use... Just tell him I said
ttgoodbye... And give him a kiss for
ttme, Okay?

The two women hug again.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (sorry)
ttBonita, you shouldn't be discouraged
ttso easily.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttI don't have the strength to fight
ttoff la Mamma... Anyway who wants to
ttspend their whole life waiting at
ttthe end of a pier.

BONITA rests her hand on JOHANA'S stomach.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>ttDid you tell him?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttNot yet... I'm waiting for the right
ttmoment.

<b>tttttBONITA
</b>tt... You take care of yourself,
ttJohana.

BONITA smiles at her and disappears down the stairs.


<b>EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DOCKING - DAY
</b>
Officials, NOVELLI, LAWRENCE, ROBERTO and of course ENZO
disembark.  There is a lot of excitement on the dock.
Everyone has already heard the news.
People swarm around ENZO.

LAWRENCE spots JACQUES in the crowd, and goes to him.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttGood huh?

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttHe really was unbelievable, 328
ttfeet, deeper than the world
ttrecord...
ttt   (then eagerly)
tt... And, Jacques!  He held his
ttbreath for four minutes and fifty
ttseconds!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (smiles too)
ttGood... I guess I have tomorrow's
ttwork cut out for me as Enzo would
ttsay...

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttt   (seriously)
ttYou must be very careful, Jacques.
ttAt these depths, to hold your breath
ttfor over five minutes is... You'd
ttreally be pushing it.  I think it's
ttvery, very dangerous.

JACQUES sees ENZO being carried past on the shoulders of
the crowd.  He ignores LAWRENCE, runs beside ENZO.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (yelling)
ttEnzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!


<b>EXT.  AWARD CEREMONY - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (in answer to the
ttt    crowd's applause)
ttThank you, thank you very much!

ENZO and NOVELLI stand on a little stage facing the crowd.
ENZO is holding a gold trophy, waving to friends in the
audience.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>tt... Now I'm sure you've heard that
ttsome people have suggested it is too
ttdangerous for us to continue.
ttDangerous, because we don't know how
ttto measure the physiological
ttconsequences of this type of dive
ttand also because the scuba divers
ttare not used to going down below 300
ttfeet.

While the attentive crowd listens to NOVELLI, ENZO is
gesturing to ROBERTO, explaining what appetizers he wants
from the cocktail trays.

The crowd laughs.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttBut, we polled the free divers and
ttthey insist that the competition
ttcontinue!

There's wild applause.  ENZO lifts the trophy over his
head, smiles like a champ and yells into the microphone.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (yelling)
ttGood luck to you all!


<b>EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY
</b>
ENZO and ROBERTO are on the front deck watching the
divers.

A German diver comes up to the surface, empty handed.
ENZO smiles.

The Tahitian comes out of the water in a semi-coma.  The
doctors carry him away.  Once he's sure that the diver is
out of danger, ENZO smiles again.

A whole team of Japanese walk over to the diving platform.
The team consists of one diver and six assistants, three
of them playing music to help the diver concentrate.  The
diver wears a white wet suit with a red circle on his
forehead.  He is concentrating very hard, so much that
ENZO walks over to him to make sure he's okay.  The
Japanese diver concentrates with such strength that he
faints.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (smiling to his
ttt    brother)
ttFabulous, what a dive, huh?

ROBERTO smiles.

The diver from the Philippines stands at the end of the
diving platform.  He concentrates for a moment then gives
up and walks away.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttHe's right.  What's the point of
ttknocking yourself out?


<b>INT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - NIGHT
</b>
They're in bed, side by side, both of them half asleep.
The only light in the room comes from the open windows.
He rolls over and watches her sleep, looking down at her
adoringly.  He slips off the chain with the gold coin.
Slowly, holding the chain, he runs the coin gently over
her body, stops at the level of her stomach and lets it
rest there.  She opens her eyes and looks at him,
wondering if he senses something.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (softly)
ttWhat are you doing?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI'm putting you on the coin... Your
ttessence... That way you'll always be
ttwith me when I dive.

She smiles, closes her eyes.  He swings the coin over her
face gently, some kind of private ceremony.  She looks
just a little intimidated.

The coin is now dangling in front of her mouth.  She
hesitates then opens her mouth, JACQUES lets the coin
slide into it.


<b>EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY
</b>
JACQUES walks up to the diving platform.

LAWRENCE has fixed scientific equipment on his chest.
JACQUES wets and slowly puts them on.

ENZO watches from the deck, his expression has changed.

JOHANA, on the deck also, opposite ENZO, watches a little
worried.  JACQUES concentrates then releases the gueuse
and lets himself disappear under the water.


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
JACQUES dives down very fast.  The control takes place at
200 feet, the doctors check him and let him go.  He
continues his descent, it's getting darker and darker
around him.

The gueuse stops at the level of the underwater platform,
just below the diver, who swims over to him in a sea of
bubbles from his oxygen bottles.  He asks JACQUES if he is
alright, JACQUES nods and gives him a huge smile before
swimming off, downwards!

The diver realizes and starts after him.  He grabs JACQUES
by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round
platform.  JACQUES lets go of the balloon.

The diver panics.  JACQUES slowly motions that everything
is fine and slowly paddles up to the surface.


<b>EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY
</b>
The boat's huge stop watch indicates min:  4:50, then
5:00, then 5:10.  JACQUES has been down there for over 5
minutes.

JOHANA is worried sick.  ENZO doesn't know what to make of
it and LAWRENCE feels completely helpless.  The stopwatch
indicates 5:20, then 5:25 and JACQUES, half unconscious,
brakes through the surface of the water.

JOHANA screams and cries with joy when she sees him.  The
crowd applauds.  ENZO is somber.

NOVELLI takes the plaque from JACQUES' hands and turns to
the crowd.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttt   (stunned)
tt360 feet!  He dove 360 feet!!!

The crowd cheers in excitement.

ENZO is sullen.  LAWRENCE is very worried.


<b>EXT.  ON PORT - END OF THE DAY
</b>
There's a pile of gear on the dock.

ENZO is in the boat loading one piece of luggage at a
time, JACQUES comes up to the boat.  Parked in the
background, we see a taxi waiting with JOHANA sitting in
the back seat.  ENZO pretends not to notice JACQUES'
arrival.

JACQUES watches him for a moment then finally dares to
speak.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (pointing at taxi)
tt... There's a party at the hotel
tttonight.

ENZO keeps loading up the boat.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (busy)
ttThat's good.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (after a beat)
ttEnzo, don't be angry.  I was
ttlucky... that's all.

ENZO throws the last duffel bag into the cockpit.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (serious)
ttI'll see you in Amorgos.

ENZO turns around and jumps onto his boat.

JACQUES walks off the dock, past the cab.  JOHANA opens
the door to let him in, but he keeps walking.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttJacques...?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttYou go back, I'll walk.

He walks off.


<b>EXT.  MARINELAND - DOLPHIN POOL - ANTIBES - NIGHT
</b>
The park is empty as JACQUES approaches the pool.

TINA the dolphin, jumps out of the water, swims to meet
JACQUES.  JACQUES pats her and kneels to talk to TINA
<b>NINA.
</b>
<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (sadly)
ttI won today.  I dove very deep,
ttTina.

The dolphin giggles.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWhat's so funny?  Can you dive
ttdeeper?

The dolphin nods "yes".

JACQUES smiles.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (smiling)
ttSo you understand everything?

The dolphin nods.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttThat's good... So tell me why
ttthey're all angry at me?  Why is
ttEnzo angry?  I never wanted to
ttcompete with him.  I never wanted to
ttbe champion of anything... All I
ttwant is to escape from them all...
ttFor just a few minutes, no people...
ttNo noise... Nothing but the sea.

The dolphin nods and giggles.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttDo you really understand me?  Huh?
ttAre we actually having a
ttconversation here?

Again the dolphin nods "yes".

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttAll right then, tell me:  can I ever
ttdive as deep as you?  Stay under as
ttlong...?

A beat.  Then the dolphin nods "yes".

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttAre you sure?

The two other dolphins stick their heads out of the water.
They all nod together.

JACQUES is awed and perplexed at the same time.


<b>EXT.  AMORGOS - DAY
</b>
The little town of Amorgos is beautiful, mountainous.
It's surrounded by a luminous turquoise sea, with white
villas clinging to hillsides.  There is a small port.  (we
saw it in the opening sequence) Further along the coast,
we see the Diving Federation Committee Boat surrounded by
all sorts of activity.


<b>INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY
</b>
Through the open windows we can see parts of the village
where JACQUES grew up.  He's staring out the window, lost
in his own thoughts.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttIt's beautiful, isn't it?

Behind him, JOHANA is hiding and throwing up.  He walks to
her.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttWhat's wrong?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttIt's nothing.  Just the long trip.
ttI'm a little jet-lagged.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttYou want to lie down for a while?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttNo, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand
ttme a glass of water?

While JACQUES gets her the water, JOHANA stares at the
view.


<b>EXT.  ENZO'S BOAT - IN THE LITTLE PORT
</b>
ROBERTO stands on the port, waiting for his brother.
Suddenly the sound of a motor boat and twelve note horn
echoes in the bay.

The boat has just arrived at the town dock.

ENZO, tears rolling down his cheeks from the wind, throws
a duffel bag on the dock and looks up at ROBERTO.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttIs he here?

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttt   (uncomfortable)
ttHe's training.

ENZO makes a face.


<b>EXT.  SMALL PORT - DAY
</b>
JOHANA sits on the little dock in front of the hotel.
JACQUES pulls on his fins, looks out into the water.

She clutches a stopwatch, ready to set it off.

A few yards behind, hidden between two bungalows, ENZO
watches them.  JACQUES takes a few deep breaths and dives
a few feet underwater.

JOHANA starts the stopwatch.

ENZO, who sees JACQUES disappear, walks over to JOHANA and
sits down beside her.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttOkay, now we have a good five
ttminutes to have a nice peaceful
tttalk.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWhat are you doing here?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttChecking out the competition.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttEnzo, why do you guys do this?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (teasing)
ttWhat else is there?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (seriously)
ttYou know what I'm talking about.
ttWhy do you and Jacques risk your
ttlives diving?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (avoiding the
ttt    question)
ttYou risk your life when you cross
ttthe street.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (frustrated)
ttDamn it!  Why won't you give me a
ttstraight answer, for once?!

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttBecause you'd laugh.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI won't, I swear.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (seriously)
ttI dive in search of God.  If I go
ttdeep enough I'm going to find him.
ttTo me, the sea is a religion... That
ttsurprises you, doesn't it?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (looking down at
ttt    Jacques in the
ttt    water)
ttA little... You think it's the same
ttfor Jacques?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (shaking his head)
ttNo.  Jacques is a creature of the
ttsea.  He isn't meant to live on
ttearth, among us... You should know
ttthis, Johana.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (reassuring herself)
ttHe can learn.  He is learning.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou really think so?  Did you tell
tthim you were pregnant?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (surprised)
ttHow do you know that?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou told Bonita, but you didn't tell
tthim, right?

JOHANA shakes her head negatively.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>tt... Not yet.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttDon't.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWhy?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttBecause he won't understand and it
ttwill just hurt you... Jacques has
ttbeen put on earth by complete
ttmistake.  And he's only waiting for
ttone thing:  that some God up there
ttwill turn him into a fish!  How long
tthas that moron been down there?

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (looking at the
ttt    stopwatch)
ttFive minutes and fifty seconds.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (grabbing away the
ttt    stopwatch)
ttThat idiot!

They jump up.  ENZO dives into the water.

As JOHANA watches panicky, ENZO pulls JACQUES up onto the
dock, in his arms.  JACQUES is unconscious.

ENZO is furious.  The fear of loosing his friend has
absolutely enraged him.  He starts pacing up and down the
dock.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttIs he alright?  What happened?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (furious)
ttThe fool was asleep!  If I weren't
ttaround, he'd already be dead!!!  Is
ttthat who you want to live with?
ttWell, good luck!  You better learn
ttto look after him because I won't
ttalways be here to do it!

Once again he marches off, then comes back.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (mumbling)
tt... How long was I asleep?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to Jacques)
ttLong enough to die.  Listen, if you
ttreally want to die, that's your
ttproblem, but don't do it under my
ttnose, okay?

A few steps away, then coming back.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (to Jacques)
ttI'll never let you take away my
tttitle.  D'you hear me?  Never!

ENZO stalks off defiantly.


<b>EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - ANCHORED OFF THE COAST
</b>
There's activity.  The competition has begun.

<b>MUSIC
</b>
A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS of different competitors at
various points in their dives.

The Tahitian comes up unconscious.
The German comes up unconscious.
So does the diver from the Philippines.

NOVELLI doesn't know what to think.


<b>EXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - JACQUES - JOHANA - SUNSET
</b>
JACQUES is in a T-shirt and jeans, rope-sole sandals.
JOHANA wears a light white cotton dress.  They both sit on
the restaurant's terrace overlooking the sea.

Below them, a small boat passes.  In it are baskets filled
with sponges.  JACQUES stares at them for a long time.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttDo you ever sometimes just stop and
ttthink how sweet life can be?

A beat.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>tt... Sure.

JOHANA wants to say something.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>tt... When you dive... with that
ttmachine... What does it feel like?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (after thinking about
ttt    it)
tt... The feeling of slipping without
ttfalling... The hardest is once you
ttare at the bottom.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttWhy?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttBecause you have to find a good
ttreason to come back up again... And
ttI always have a hard time finding
ttone.

JOHANA has never looked so sad and lost.

JACQUES doesn't notice.

ENZO who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to
play, staring at the sea.

JACQUES and JOHANA turn around and look at him.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (smiling)
tt... You should start playing the
ttpiano, the piano is really
ttrefreshing, it clears the sinuses.
ttVery good the piano!  Tomorrow is
ttgoing to be a big day!


<b>EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT UNDERWAY - ON JACQUES
</b>
He's alone in the bow.  The others are clustered in the
saloon, cockpit in the stern.  The boat is moving close to
the cliffs.  The monastery looms above them.

<b>CLOSE ON JACQUES
</b>
He's scanning the apparently abandoned monastery searching
for signs of life.

A red and blue taxi-boat pulls up alongside the Committee
Boat.  In it, LAWRENCE waits to climb on board.


<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY
</b>
ENZO puts his flippers on and grabs his gueuse.  He is
serious, concentrating hard.

LAWRENCE'S boat slides along the big Committee Boat and
the DOCTOR climbs onto it.


<b>INT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - LAWRENCE - NOVELLI - OTHERS
</b>
LAWRENCE'S briefcase is open.  There's a stack of graph
paper on a cabin table.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>tt... When I analyzed the data from
ttMayol's last dive, it became
ttapparent...
ttt   (taps the graph
ttt    paper)
tt... At the depths these men are
ttdiving, it is a physiological
ttimpossibility that they can retain
ttenough oxygen in their blood to make
ttit back to the surface.  It's a
ttfunction of how long it takes to get
ttto the bottom, orient themselves and
ttto return... To attempt to break
ttMayol's record is simple suicide.
ttt   (to Novelli)
ttFor the last time.  I'm telling you
ttcancel the competition.

NOVELLI and the MEDIC look over at the diving platform
where ENZO is concentrating.

<b>tttttMEDIC
</b>ttMolinari's a seventeen time world
ttchampion.  Do you want to tell him
tthe can't dive.

LAWRENCE doesn't answer.  NOVELLI is thinking.

<b>tttttNOVELLI
</b>ttGet Mayol in here.


<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO
</b>
ENZO is preparing.  He sits at the edge of the platform
hyperventilating, almost in a trance.

We see JACQUES in the background, talking to NOVELLI, he
then walks over to ENZO and climbs down next to him.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttEnzo?
ttt   (no response)
ttEnzo... I know you're angry at me.
ttt   (no response)
ttEnzo, it's important.

ENZO opens one eye.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttI'm concentrating.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (quickly)
ttWe can't dive anymore.  They want to
ttcancel the competition for a while.

ENZO looks at him coldly.  Takes another deep breath.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (rushing on)
ttIt's not safe, they say.  The
ttdoctors say it isn't possible to go
ttdeeper and live.  Free diving is
ttover as a sport.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttYou say that because you have the
tttitle!

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttNo!  I would never cheat you.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttWell that's very nice of you.

He takes a last breath, signs himself and reaching for the
gueuse, disappears into the water.

LAWRENCE, NOVELLI, the MEDICS, and others are arguing.
LAWRENCE is furious that ENZO is diving.  NOVELLI is
balling out his assistants.

JACQUES is on the platform watching the others as if they
were a gaggle of geese.  He listens to the sound of the
gueuse playing out, watches the depth indicator, the
stopwatches.  He knows something is wrong.

He walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little
oxygen bottle which is there for security.  He takes a few
breaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives
down after ENZO.


<b>UNDERWATER - JACQUES
</b>
JACQUES pulls himself down the cable, hand over hand.
80 or 90 feet down he sees a group of MEDICS coming toward
him carrying ENZO'S unconscious body.

JACQUES struggles with them, pushes them away, takes ENZO
in his arms and climbs toward the surface, frantic,
screaming silently at him, desperate to get away from the
flow of air bubbles from the scuba tanks, the commotion,
the memory of death.

ENZO has a big serene smile on his face.  The MEDICS push
both divers toward the surface.

As if they were on land, JACQUES starts shaking ENZO to
wake him up.  He then slaps his face but ENZO remains
unconscious.

They finally break the surface in each others arms.


<b>EXT.  ON DIVING PLATFORM
</b>
They pull ENZO out of the water.  The doctors open his
jacket.  ENZO motions to JACQUES to come close.  He still
has that long smile.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (faintly)
ttYou were right.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (moved)
tt... I was right about what?

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttt   (after a long
ttt    silence)
tt... It is much better down there.
ttIt's a better place.

He tries to take a deep breath, the effort is exhausting.
JACQUES smiles, holding back his tears.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>tt... Push me back in the water...

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (crying)
ttI can't.

<b>tttttENZO
</b>ttJacques, take me back down...
ttPlease.

His smile freezes, he stops breathing.  His eyes close.

JACQUES puts his head down on his friend's chest and sobs.
The doctors gently try to move him away, but JACQUES
resists.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttJust give him five minutes!  What
ttdoes it matter now, anyway... Come
tton, just leave him alone!

LAWRENCE encourages everybody to leave the platform.

JACQUES quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his
belt.  Before anybody can stop him, JACQUES rolls ENZO'S
body back into the water and dives after it.


<b>UNDERWATER - JACQUES
</b>
He holds ENZO in his arms.  Lets the dead weight of the
body pull him down, deeper and deeper.  The rope around
JACQUES' waist runs out, stops his descent with an abrupt
jerk.  When he feels it, JACQUES lets go... watches as
ENZO'S body continues to drift by itself into the
bottomless blue...


<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM
</b>
The doctors have run over and are pulling the cable that
JACQUES is attached to.  He is unconscious when they pull
him up.  They hold him up by his feet.  JACQUES throws up
gallons of water.  They put an oxygen mask on his face.

<b>tttttA DOCTOR
</b>ttt   (listening to his
ttt    heartbeat)
ttThe heart is going to stop!  The
ttstimulator, quickly.

Suddenly, everything collapses for JACQUES.  Sounds
disappear.  The image slows down, the light fades.

JACQUES only hears his heartbeat, which slows down.

His heart stops.

Among the crowd around him, he sees JOHANA, fresh, gentle,
smiling.  Her movements are smooth and slowed down.  She
smiles at him, simply.  JACQUES smiles back.  The heart
starts again slowly.

The image goes back to normal.

Sounds multiply (doctors, the panic, etc...) and slowly
come back.

JACQUES falls unconscious.

<b>tttttA DOCTOR
</b>ttThe heart started again!  It's all
ttright!

NOVELLI falls back in his chair, relieved.

JACQUES is lying on the bed, he has a strong fever.

JOHANA sits at his feet.

LAWRENCE rummages through a medical kit.  He takes a pill
from a bottle and gives it to him.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttTake this.  Have a good sleep.

JACQUES swallows the pills.  JOHANA walks over from the
balcony.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttSweet dreams.

LAWRENCE motions to JOHANA that they should let him sleep.
He goes out of the room.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (tenderly to Johana,
ttt    who had started to
ttt    leave the room)
ttKiss me.

JOHANA bends over and kisses him.

JACQUES holds her by the arm, doesn't want her to leave.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttSleep now.  We'll talk later.

JOHANA kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room.


<b>EXT.  HOTEL BAR - ON TERRACE - LAWRENCE - JOHANA
</b>
They're at the little zinc bar.  Not talking, not really
drinking either, just toying with their glasses.

ROBERTO passes, stops.

<b>tttttROBERTO
</b>ttI've packed all of... Enzo's
ttclothes.
ttt   (a beat)
ttI'm going to the radio telephone...
ttt   (swallowing)
tt... to call Mamma.

They watch sadly as he leaves.


<b>INT.  JACQUES ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
JACQUES sitting up in bed finally lies down under the
sheets.  He turns off the light by the bed.


<b>INT.  HOTEL RESTAURANT - LAWRENCE - JOHANA
</b>
They've moved from the bar to the table.  There is uneaten
food in front of them.  A third place is set.

JOHANA looks at the wall clock.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttI'll go see how he's doing.

<b>tttttLAWRENCE
</b>ttLet him sleep.


<b>INT.  JACQUES ROOM - JACQUES
</b>
JACQUES is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore.  He
is breathing loudly, as if tired out.  From his POV the
room becomes very dark and blue.  The noise is unbearable.
The ceiling turns into water.

JACQUES' eyes are wide open.  His face is sweating.  The
water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he
is swallowed by it.

As he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air
at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue.

The dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of
muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.  They
all break through the surface to gulp air regularly.

Suddenly, one of them, leaves the group.  He crosses the
blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.  We see a sonar
picture.  It's an image in which the dolphin will appear a
few seconds later.  The dolphin comes up like a rocket,
gulps air and goes back down.

The sonar image appears again.  Finally, the dolphin,
locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly
like a war plane.  He manages to break the group in two,
then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim.

He breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.  He
goes full power.  The fish he is after are even more
divided.  There is only one left, totally lost and in a
panic.

The exhausted fish is swallowed.

The dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface
in slow motion.  Images becomes pale and bright.

He screams inhumanly.

Image is white, black, silence.


<b>INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES
</b>
JOHANA opens the shutters.

The room is a shamble of broken glass, water pitcher and
glasses, lamps and vases.  The windows are blown out.

JACQUES is lying in bed.  There is a thin trickle of blood
coming from his nose and ears.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (in a panic)
ttJacques... Are you alright?


<b>EXT.  DOCK - JACQUES - JOHANA - NIGHT
</b>
JACQUES jumps into ENZO'S boat.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (still worried)
ttJacques?  Are you alright?  Answer
ttme!  Are you alright?

She jumps down into ENZO'S boat.  He starts the engine.
The boat is racing out of the port.  JOHANA yells over the
sound of the engine.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYou've got to tell me what happened?

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttI saw how it has to be.

JACQUES parks the boat in front of the COMMITTEE BOAT'S
DIVING PLATFORM.  He turns on the platform lights:  above
and underwater.  He throws down the diving cable:  60, 90,
120 feet...

JACQUES gets undressed and sits down in the lotus
position, concentrating...

JOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him,
wondering just how far he is going to push this whole
thing.

As the cable unrolls, JOHANA starts crying.  She
understands that JACQUES is going to dive to the bottom,
into the blue, into himself.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttJacques, you know I love you.

JACQUES is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his
gueuse.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttt   (after a silence)
ttDon't be sad... It's not because of
ttyou, it's me.  It's all going on
ttinside me!
ttt   (a beat)
ttI've gotta go and see.

JOHANA starts pacing up and down the diving platform.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttSee what?  There is nothing to see!
ttIt's pitch black down there!  It's
ttcold.  You'll be all alone!  Look at
ttme, Jacques!  I am here!  I exist!
ttLook!!!
ttt   (she starts waving
ttt    her arms)
ttI'm real!  I am not a dream!
ttJacques will you look at me?
ttt   (she breaks down)
ttPlease!

JACQUES has not moved, he still sits motionless, facing
his gueuse.

JOHANA doesn't know what to do or say.  She is totally
drained.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttJacques?  I'm pregnant.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttThat's good... that's wonderful.
ttIt's wonderful for you.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttYou are the father.

Silence.  JACQUES is petrified, without any reaction.  He
doesn't understand.  She realizes it's hopeless and stares
at the sea.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttt   (after a while)
ttI lied... to keep you here.

She kisses him.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttPromise me one thing.

<b>tttttJACQUES
</b>ttAnything.

<b>tttttJOHANA
</b>ttPromise you won't forget me.

She pulls the line releasing the gueuse.

JACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the
gueuse, disappears into the water -- as if swallowed by
the ocean.


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
JACQUES slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of
the gueuse.  He has a beautiful smile on his face.  He is
in his element.  Night has closed in around him.  He turns
on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light
around him.


<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT
</b>
JOHANA has walked over to the edge of the platform.  She
is holding the cable, to "hear" JACQUES' descent.

The counter shows that JACQUES is quickly passing the 300
feet mark.


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
JACQUES keeps going down, as serene as ever.  He has
gained a lot of speed.


<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT
</b>
JOHANA holds her face in her hands.  The counter indicates
that JACQUES is going very fast.


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
The gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable.  JACQUES
turns his body right side up.


<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT
</b>
The counter now indicates a depth of 600 feet.

JOHANA has felt the jolt of the cable.  She cries her
tears and looks down at the water.


<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
The headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet
around JACQUES, as if he were standing in a circle of
light.  He stays there, patiently floating around and
around his cable... as if he were waiting for something.

A long form circles the border between the darkness and
the light.

JACQUES holds out his hand.  A dolphin comes and presses
its body against it.  Two other dolphins come out of the
night.  JACQUES watches in amazement.

A dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES' hand, ready to lead
him off.  JACQUES hesitates.

JACQUES lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away.
Their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night.
