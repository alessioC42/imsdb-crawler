<b>tINT. BASEMENT - EVENING
</b>
tA NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE.  It dangles from the ceiling of
ta basement.

tLIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs.

tAnna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence.  She stands
tin the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines
ther slender body.  Her gentle eyes move across the empty room and
tcome to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall.

tShe walks to the bottles.  Her fingertips slide over the labels.
tShe stops when she finds just the right one.  A tiny smile as she
tslides it out.

tAnna turns to leave.  Stops.  She stares at the shadowy basement.
tIt's an unsettling place.  She stands very still and watches her
tbreath form a TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR.  She's visibly
tuncomfortable.

tAnna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry.  Each step faster
tthan the next.  She climbs out of the basement in another burst
tof LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS.

<b>tWE HEAR HER HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH.
</b>
<b>tTHE LIGHTBULB DIES.  DRIPPING BLACK DEVOURS THE ROOM.
</b>
<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. DINING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
tTwo place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table.
tTake-out Chinese food sits half eaten on good china.  An empty
tbottle of red wine sits between boxes of Chinese food.

tAnna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater.
tShe hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to Malcolm.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttIt's getting cold.

tMALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and
ttie on the sofa behind him.  A jacket and an overcoat lay on a
tbrirfcase next to him.

tMalcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking,
tintelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study.  His
tcharming, easy-going smile spreads across his face.  He points.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttThat's one fine frame.  A fine
ttframe it is.

tMalcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a
tdining room chair.  It's printed on aged parchment-type paper.
tThe frame is a polished mahogany.

tHe slips on the sweatshirt.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttHow much does a fine frame like
ttthat cost, you think?

tAnna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttI've never told you...  but you
ttsound a little like Dr. Seuss when
ttyou're drunk.

tMalcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttAnna, I'm serious.  Serious I am,
ttAnna.

tAnna giggles.  She's clearly buzzed herself.  Malcolm doesn't get
tit.  Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine.  Her attention
tslowly moves to the framed certificate.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttMahogany.  I'd say that cost at
ttleast a couple hundred.  Maybe
ttthree.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttThree?  We should hock it.  Buy a
ttC.D. rack for the bedroom.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttDo you know how important this is?
ttThis is big time.
ttt(beat)
ttI'm going to read it for you,
ttdoctor.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttDo I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

tAnna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat.  She leans forward
ther seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to
ttickle her.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttIn recognition for his outstanding
ttachievement in the field of child
ttpsychology, his dedication to his
ttwork, and his continuing efforts to
ttimprove the quality of life for
ttcountless children and their
ttfamilies, the City of Philadelphia
ttproudly bestows upon its son Dr.
ttMalcolm Crowe...  That's you...
ttthe Mayor's Citation for
ttProfessional Excellence.

tBeat.  The power of the words sobers the two of them.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttWow.  They called you their son.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttWe can keep it in the bathroom.

tAnna turns to Malcolm.  He smiles.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttIt's not real, Anna.  Some
ttsecretary wrote that up.  Don't
tttell me you thought it was real?

tAnna's expression becomes serious.


<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttWhat?

tShe just keeps staring.  Beat.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttDon't do the quiet thing.  You know
ttI hate it.

tBeat.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttThis is an important night for us.
ttFinally someone is recognizing the
ttsacrifices you made.  That you have
ttput everything second, including me,
ttfor those families they're talking
ttabout.

tMalcolm plays softly with her face.  Anna takes his hands and
tholds them steady.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttThey're also saying that my husband
tthas a gift.  Not an ordinary gift
ttthat allows him to hit a ball over a
ttfence.  Or a gift that lets him
ttproduce beautiful images on a
ttcanvas...  Your gift teaches
ttchildren how to be strong in
ttsituations where most adults would
ttpiss on themselves.
ttt(beat)
ttYes, I believe what they wrote
ttabout you.

tAnna lets go of his hands.  Anna's eyes are emotional.  Malcolm
tsmiles softly.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttThank you.

tAnna leans towards him.  They hold each other tight.  Beat.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttWhat are we hugging about again?

tAnna laughs as she wipes her eyes.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttNothing.  There wasn't supposed to
ttbe any crying at this celebration.
ttJust a lot of drinking and sex.

tMalcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttI would like some red wine in a
ttglass.

tAnna hands him his glass.  He stares at it.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttI would not like it in a mug.  I
ttwould not like it in a jug.

tMalcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said.  They crack up
tlaughing.  THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tTWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY.  They try to
tturn on the light.  It doesn't come on.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttBulb's out.

tAnna giggles some more as Malcolm's shadow stumbles across the
tbedroom.

<b>tMALCOLM TURNS ON THE BATHROOM LIGHT.
</b>
tA SHAFT OF LIGHT falls on Anna as she stands in the corner of the
troom.

tAnna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater.  She sways to a
tpretend striptease song.

tMalcolm can't hold back his grin.  He joins in -- slowly peeling
toff the sweat-shirt.  He looks back to Anna.  She's stopped her
tplayful dance.  She's facing away from him.

tHe walks towards her.  HIS GRIN QUIETLY DISAPPEARS.  Malcolm's
tface turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the SHATTERED
tWINDOW in their bedroom.  The wind moves through the room.  A
tlamp lays broken on the ground by the window.

tMalcolm kneels down.  Beat.  Anna's eyes fill with a quiet
tawareness.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttHe's still in the house.

<b>tA SHADOW FROM THE BATHROOM FLATS OVER BOTH OF THEM.
</b>
<b>tANNA SCREAMS.
</b>
tMalcolm spins around.  His heart stops.

tMalcolm and Anna stare at the bathroom doorwary.  They know
tsomeone is inside.  Beat.

tMalcolm slowly starts towards the door.  The first thing that
tcomes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor.  Then the
tfigure of a man comes into view.  A STRANGER stands bare chested
tin the back of the bathroom.

<b>tNO ONE MAKES A SOUND.
</b>
tThe STRANGER is about nineteen.  Drugged out.  Pitch black eyes
tbulging.  His body is covered in scars and bruises.  His hands
tare folded in front of him.  He shakes ever so slightly.  He has a
tpatch of white in his hair.

tMalcolm speaks in a very calm voice.  Never takes his eyes off
tthe stranger.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttAnna, don't move.  Don't say a word.

tAnna barely nods her understanding.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttt(to the stranger)
ttThis is forty-seven Locust Street.
ttYou have broken a window and
ttentered a private residence.  Do
ttyou understand what I'm saying?

tThe stranger slowly looks up for the first time.  His eyes lock
ton Malcolm.

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttYou don't know so many things.

tBeat.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttThere are no needles or
ttprescription drugs of any kind in
ttthis house.

tThe stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway.  Malcolm
tstumbles back onto the edge of the bed.

tAnna sees the stranger for the first time.  Her face drains of
tcolor.

tThe stranger looks at Malcolm.  He half grins.

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttAre you drunk?

tThe stranger's stare slides to Anna.

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttDid you get him drunk?

tThe stranger gazes at Anna.  Gazes directly into her eyes.  A
tpenetrating, unwavering stare.


<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttDo you know why you're scared when
ttyou're alone?

tAnna's expression instanly changes.

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttI know.

<b>tBEAT.  THE ROOM GOES SILENT.
</b>
<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttWhat do you want?  I don't
ttunderstand what you want.

tThe stranger turns and glares at Malcolm.

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttWhat you promised.

tMalcolm stops all movement.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>tt--My God.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>tt--Do I know you?

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttLet's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm
ttCrowe. Recipient of awards from the
ttMayor on the news.  Dr. Malcolm
ttCrowe, he's helped so many children...
ttAnd he doesn't even remember my
ttname?

tMalcolm can't speak.  Beat.  The stranger's face starts to
ttremble.

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttI was ten when you worked with me.

tBeat.  Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers.

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttDowntown clinic?  Single parent
ttfamily?
ttt(beat)
ttI had a possible mood disorder...
ttt(beat)
ttI had no friends... you said I was
ttsocially isolated.
ttt(beat)
ttI was afraid -- you called it acute
ttanxiety...
ttt(beat)
ttYou were wrong.
ttt(beat)
ttCome on, clear your head...  Male,
ttnine...  Single parent...  Mood
ttdiscorder... Acute anxiety.

tMalcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer.

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttI'm nineteen.  I have drugs in my
ttsystem twenty-four hours a day...
ttI still have no friends.  I still
tthave no peace.  I'm still afraid.

tTears jump into the stranger's eyes.

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>tt...I'm still afraid.

tMalcolm stands.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttPlease give me a second to think.

tMalcolm's shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the
tstranger.  Beat.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttBed Freidken?

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttSome people call me freak.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>tt...Ronald...  Ronald Sumner?

tTears fall down the stranger's face.

<b>ttt     STRANGER
</b>ttI am a freak.

tMalcolm looks up at the sound of those words.  Something clicks
tin his head.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>tt--Vincent?

<b>tTHE ROOM GOES SILENT AGAIN.
</b>
<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttVincent Gray?

tVINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears.

tMalcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep
twaters.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttI do remember you, Vincent.  You
ttwere a good kid.  Very smart...
ttQuiet...  Compassionate...
ttUnusually compassionate...

tVincent's eyes burn at Malcolm.

<b>ttt     VINCENT
</b>ttYou forgot cursed.

tVINCENT is fully crying now.

<b>ttt     VINCENT
</b>ttYou failed me.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttt(whispers)
ttVincent...  I'm sorry I didn't help
ttyou...  I can try to help you now.

tVincent turns to the sink.  His hand goes in.  He turns arund and
traises a gun at Malcolm.  He FIRES.  A VIOLENT, EAR-SHATTERING
tECHO.  Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll
tonto the bed.

tVincent instantly moves the gun to his own head.  ANOTHER
tHORRIFIC BLAST SPIKES THE AIR.  Vincent crumples onto the
tbathroom floor.

<b>tANNA'S CHILLING SCREAMS FILL THEIR HOME.
</b>
<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. BENCH - AFTERNOON
</b>
tThe legend, "Two Years Later" appears.

tA man flips open a worn file folder on his lap.  Handwritten
tnotes fill every line.  At the top of the first page reads,
t"Vincent Gray, age 10, Referred January 19, 1989."

tThe man's hand touches the name almost reverently.

tHe glances through the page.  Words and phrases are circled
tthroughout the file.

t"...Acute anxiety"
t"...Socially isolated"
t"...Possible mood disorder"
t"...Parent status -- Divorced"
t"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

tThe man's hands flip the page.  At the top of this new page
treads, "Cole Sear, age 8, Referred September 1998."

tAs the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words
tand phrases circled throughout this new case history.

t"...Acute anxiety"
t"...Socially isolated"
t"...Possible mood disorder"
t"...Parent status -- Divorced"
t"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

tThe hands close the notepad.  The hands are slightly shaking now.

tWE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr. Malcolm
tCrowe.

tMalcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes
tacross the street.  He gazes blankly at the brownstones.  Beat.

tA door opens.  Malcolm is brought out of his trance.

tCOLE SEAR steps out his front door.  Cole is a munchkin of a boy
twith large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around
thim.

tHis hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side.
tCole carefully locks the door behind him.

tHe moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously.
tAnxiously.

tThe eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a
tpair of VERY LARGE GLASSES.  They look comical on him.

tMalcolm rises to his feet.  He smooths out his shirt.  Looks down
tand buttons his jacket.

tWhen he looks up, Cole is gone.

tMalcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy.  Cole runs at full
tspeed down the street and turns the corner.  TINY SNEAKERS
<b>tSCREECHING ON THE SIDEWALK.
</b>
tFor a second, Malcolm doesn't react.  The second passes.  He
tstuffs the file in his bag and starts running too.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
tMalcolm hauls down the sidewalk.  He comes to a hard stop at a
tstreet intersection.  Searches.  Spots Cole running into a
tparking lot.

tCOLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a
tbuilding.  He has to use all his strength to push open the highly
tornate doors.  He slips inside.

tMalcolm jogs into the parking area.  His pace slows to a walk and
tthen to stillness as he gazes up at the building.  Its old stone
tand huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all
taround it.  Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church
tquietly.

tA SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE.  Malcolm's hand goes to it
tquickly.  He waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate
tdoors.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CHURCH - DAY
</b>
tOnly a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews.

tMalcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for
tin the last row of the church.

tHe moves down the center aisle towards the back.

tMalcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and
tbeige plastic soldiers.  Cole makes the soldiers talk to each
tother.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttt(soft)
ttPro... Fun... Add...

tThe words are unintelligible.

tCole senses someone.  He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at
thim.  The boy immediately goes white.  Every cell of his body
tstill with fear.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttIt's okay, Cole.  Don't be
ttfrightened.

tCole stays rigid.  Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttMy name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.  I
ttwas supposed to meet you today.
ttSorry I missed our appointment.

tMalcolm waits for a response.  None comes.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttDo you mind if I sit down?  I have
ttthis injury from a couple of years
ttago and it flares up every once in
tta while just so I won't forget it.

tBeat.  Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of
tthe seat.  Malcolm sits.

tCole fidgets with his soldiers.  Beat.  Malcolm looks over and
tstares at Cole's glasses.  He leans forward to inspect them more
tcarefully.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttYour eye frames.  They don't seem to
tthave any lenses in them.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttt(soft)
ttThey're my dad's.  The lenses hurt
ttmy eyes.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttI knew there was a sound explanation.

tMalcolm returns to staring at his lap.  Beat.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttWhat was that you were saying
ttbefore with your soldiers?  Day pro
ttfun.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>tt...De profundis clamo ad te domine.

tMalcolm stares surprised.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttIt's called Latin.  It's a
ttlanguage.

tMalcolm nods at the information.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttAll your soldiers speak Latin?

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttNo, just one.

tMalcolm smiles at Cole.  His eyes drift down to Cole's arms.
tMalcolm's smile slowly disappears.

tCole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES.  Some almost
thealed.  Some fresh.  Malcolm looks around to gather himself.
tBeat.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttI like churches, too.
ttt(beat)
ttIn olden times, in Europe, people
ttused to hide in churches.  Claim
ttsanctuary.

tCole looks up.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttWhat were they hiding from?

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttOh, lots of things, I suppose.  Bad
ttpeople for one.  People who wanted
ttto imprison them.  Hurt them.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttNothing bad can happen in a church,
ttright?

tMalcolm studies Cole's anxious face.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttRight.

tMalcolm and Cole just stare at each other.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttI forgot your name.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttDr. Crowe.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttYou're a doctor.  What kind?

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttI work with young people who might
ttbe sad or upset or just want to
tttalk.  I try to help them figure
ttthings out.

tBeat.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttAre you a good doctor?

tMalcolm smiles.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttI got an award once.  From the
ttMayor.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttCongratulations.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttThank you.  It was a long time ago.
ttI've kind of been retired for a
ttwhile.
ttt(beat)
ttYou're my very first client back.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttYou use needles?

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttNot even little ones that aren't
ttsupposed to hurt?

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttThat's good.

tCole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttI'm going to see you again, right?

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttIf it's okay with you?

tCole thinks it over carefully.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttIt's okay with me.

tCole and Malcolm just stare at each other.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttAnd Cole, next time I won't be late
ttfor you.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttNext time I won't be scared of you.

tCole turns and starts to the rear of the church.  Malcolm loses
thimself in his thoughts.

tWhen Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and
ttake a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table.  Cole pockets the
tstatue and quietly leaves the church.

tMalcolm just sits and stares.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. MALCOLM'S HOME - EVENING
</b>
tThe house is dimly lit.  Malcolm has to turn on the HALLWAY LIGHT.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttIt's me.

tHe stops before a pile of mail collecting on a thin table.  He
tstares at it blankly.  Almost every envelope has "Over Due" or
t"Final Notice" stamped on it.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. DINING TABLE - EVENING
</b>
tMalcolm stares down at the remains of a meal on the only place
tsetting on the table.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. BEDROOM - EVENING
</b>
tMalcolm quietly walks into his bedroom.  Only A READING LIGHT IS
<b>tON.  THE SOFT LIGHT FALLS ON ANNA AS SHE SLEEPS.
</b>
tMalcolm moves to her side.  The sight of her stops him.

tHe stares at his wife...

tShe huddles under a blanket, a wad of tissues in her hand.  He
ttakes it in silently.

tHis eyes move to her face...  One wisp of hair falls over her
tsoft lips.  OUTLINED IN THE SOFT READING LIGHT, Anna Crowe truly
tlooks like an angel.

tMalcolm forms a tiny smile.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. HALL - NIGHT
</b>
tMalcolm turns and moves for a narrow door in the hallway.

tTHE DOOR KNOB.  He tries to open it.  IT'S LOCKED.  Malcolm
treaches into his pockets.  Searches for his keys.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tThe empty basement is no longer empty.  It's piled with file
tcabinets and boxes of psychology and medical books.  A desk sits
tin the corner next to the wine racks.

tThe room still feels unsettling.

tMalcolm hunches over one of the books.  Rifles through a stack of
tdusty books.  Pulls out a thick text.

tThe spine of the text reads, "The Meridian Latin Dictionary."

tMalcolm sits back at his desk and opens Cole's file.  Handwritten
ton the first page are the words,

tt"De profundis calms ad te, domine"

tMalcolm starts working through the Latin text.  As he comes to
teach word, he jots it down underneath the Latin.

tMalcolm translates the last word.

tHe stares quietly at the paper.  The new words reads...

tt"Out of the depths, I cry to you Lord."

tBeat.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttt(whispers)
tt...The mass for the dead.

tThe words seem to hang in the air forever.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. PHILADELPHIA - DAWN
</b>
tOld Philadelphia awakens...  For a moment, it's like we're back
tin time.

tA golden sun dances on the waters of Penns Landing.  Historical
told ships sit docked in its harbor...  The dark bronze surface of
tthe Liberty Bell reflects the dawn...  A majestic Independence
tHall stands watch as its city begins to stir...  A thirty foot
tstatue of Ben Franklin makes a proud silhouette against the
tmorning sky...

<b>tAND THEN 1997 COMES CRASHING IN.
</b>
tFLUORESCENT HOUSE LIGHTS COME ON IN WINDOWS...  Jeeps and
thatchbacks start roaming the cobblestone streets...  Neon
trestaurants signs flicker to life...  Traffic helicopters make
ttheir rounds...  CAR ALARMS PIERCE THE AIR.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING
</b>
tA hand turns off a radio, shutting off the morning news.

tThe dog is gone now.  Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a
tnew tie.  She finds one, then turns and steps back into the

tdoesn't move at all.

tAnna sits alone at a corner table.  The remains of her half-eaten
tdinner lay on the only place setting on the table.  A small PIECE
tOF CAKE WITH A CANDLE in it sits untouched.

tAnna stirs sugar in her coffee as Malcolm sits in the seat across
tfrom her.  She gently stops stirring, but doesn't look up.  Beat.

tAnna looks around for the waiter.

tthave the same mannerisms.  The same

ttIt might be some kind of abuse.

tThat makes Anna turn back.  She glances across the table, then
tlooks down.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttThere are cuts on Cole's arms.

ttHard to say this early.  Could

tMalcolm loses himself in his thoughts.  The waiter drops off the
tcheck on the table.  Anna grabs it before Malcolm and quickly
tsigns it.

</b>ttYou want to ask me a question?

tto them.

tTwo rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that
toverlook the street...  A corner table displays fancy wooden
tchess set.  The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust...
tAn easel stands before a piano.  The incomplete water color
tpainting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench
tsits sadly on the faded yellow paper.

tMalcolm takes in the living room silently.  He stands near the
topen door.

tCole walks through the room.  Tiny eyes searching carefully.  He
tleans behind the sofa looking for something.  Malcolm watches
tCole with a crinkled brow.

tCole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall.

</b>ttThank you.

tMr. Marschal shuffles over to the sofa.  Takes a seat.

tpush the plant aside revealing AN AIR VENT.  Cole gently reaches
tover and takes off the metal face.  It slips right off.

tCole's hands disappear into the darkness of the vent.  They
treemerge holding a STACK OF NOTEBOOKS.

tMalcolm becomes very still.

tCole softly lays his hand on Mr. Marschal's silver hair.  Mr.
tMarschal reaches up and clutches his small hand.

tThey stay like that for a while.  Beat.  Mr. Marschal lets go and

</b>
<b>tINT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
</b>
tLynn holds a laundry basket on her hip as she fiddles with the
tthermostat in the hall.  The house is cold.  Lynn wears a winter
tjacket in the house.

tLynn turns and moves into the shadowy hallway.  No lights.  The
thouse seems somewhat ominous.  Beat.

tLynn's eyes dart to an open guest room like she just saw
tsomething.  She stares in the doorway until a SOUND TURNS HER IN
<b>tTHE DIRECTION OF THE FAMILY ROOM.
</b>
tShe picks up balled-up boy's sweat socks and dirty T-shirts
tlaying on the carpet.  When she reaches the end of the hall, she
tHITS A LIGHT SWITCH.  The hall LIGHTS UP REVEALING A WALL OF
tPHOTOS.  Lynn forms a tiny smile.

tSnapshots of Cole and Lynn's life hang before her eyes.

tCole's birthday parties...  Lynn and Cole at an amusement park...
tCole under the Christmas tree...  Cole on Lynn's shoulders in a
tpool...  Cole with a group of neighbors at a barbecue...

tLynn takes a step forward.  Lynn's face betrays the fact that she
tnotices something she never noticed before.  She touches a photo
tof three-year-old Cole.

<b>tWE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO -- COLE'S FACE SMILES AT US.  LYNN'S
</b><b>tFINGER GENTLY BRUSHES A THIN STREAKS OF LIGHT THAT CURVES IN THE
</b><b>tBACKGROUND BEHIND COLE.  THE STREAK OF LIGHT IS BLURRED, LIKE
</b><b>tSOMETHING CAUGHT IN MOTION.
</b>
tLynn looks to the adjacent photo -- the barbecue photo --
tEveryone stands with hot dogs and sodas.  Lynn searches the
tpicture.  Her eyes suddenly stop at the TINIEST BLUR OF WHITE
<b>tLIGHT STREAKING AROUND COLE.
</b>
<b>tWE MOVE FROM FRAMED PHOTO TO FRAMED PHOTO -- EACH THE SAME --
</b><b>tSOMEWHERE HIDDEN IN THE FRAME, SOMEWHERE NOT EASILY SEEN, LYNN

tLynn takes it all in curiously.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

<b>tINT. COLE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
tLynn moves into Cole's room with the laundry basket balanced on
ther hip.  The Walkman headphones on her head blares A MUFFLED
tTECHNO DANCE BEAT.  Lynn starts picking clothes up around Cole's
troom.

tThis bedroom is an eerie place.  The shadows seem to make shapes
tand figures.  All the furniture is wood -- old fashioned.  The
tlamps, the paintings on the wall -- antiques as well.

tThe most striking feature of the room, however, is the homemade
ttent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to chairs and
tbureaus.  It takes up a large corner of the room.

tA sign hangs over the bedsheets.

<b>tt"DO NOT ENTER"
</b>
tLynn grabs the spiderman P.J.s that drape over the tent.

tA German Shepherd Puppy sleeps on the pillow.  SEBASTIAN lifts
this head sleepily and peers at Lynn before returning to his
tslumber.

tLynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under
tCole's pillow.  Slides it out...  It's a VACATION PHOTO of a
tcouple.  Lynn and Cole and a man.  The man looks in every way a
tlarger version of Cole.

tThe picture has a visible effect on Lynn.  She lets out a shaky
tbreath before returning the photo to its hiding place.

tLynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll
tcover desk next to the bed.

tThe desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings.
tLynn's eyes are drawn to the papers.

tHer curious gaze turns serious.  Her mouth opens a tiny bit
tinvoluntarily.

tTHE PAPERS are strewn with lines of handwriting.  Countless
tlines.  Thousands of words...  Some horizontal, some vertical...
tThe writing moves in arcs and flows in various size -- written at
tgreat speed -- every word connected by a single pen stroke --
teverything written in one continuous motion.

tLynn slowly spins the papers, taking in some of the phrases...

t<i>...Christ break the freaking glass oh no God no what the hell is
tgoing on Quiet the damn baby I'll cut you I swear it someone stop
tthe burning I'll kill you I'll kill all you bastard...</i>

tThe words go on and on.

tLynn removes her hands from the paper.  She pulls her headphones
toff slowly.

</b>ttOne night, as an example...  leave

tCole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully.

</b>ttYou don't have to answer now.

tMalcolm heads for the door, stops when Cole emerges from behind
tthe couch.  Cole is wearing his father's jacket, it hangs to the
tground like a dress.

</b>ttInstead of something I want, can I

ttAmerica from 1790 to 1800?

tMr. Cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine
tyear old private school students.  They stare back at him blankly.

tCole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big
teyes.

<b>ttt     MR. CUNNINGHAM

tStanley Cunningham looks over the class of blank faces.  He's
tjust about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up.
tMr. Cunningham looks surprised to see who it is.

</b>ttYou talked funny when you went to

tto cry.

tfolded arms on the table.

tMalcolm peeks his head in the door -- unsure if he's in the right
tplace.  He spots Cole and enters the room.  He silently takes a
tseat across from Cole.  The eight-year-old looks up.  Cole's eyes
tare hard -- filled with anger.

</b>ttHey, big guy.

tCole stares for a second.

</b>ttDo you like magic?

tCole's face softens a bit.  He turns from the windows and looks
tto Malcolm.  Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

tMalcolm pulls out a penny from his pocket.  He places it in his
tright hand.

</b>ttWatch the penny closely.

tMalcolm closes his hand around the penny.

tcarefully.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttAnd suddenly the penny has

tCole looks to Malcolm's closed left hand.  Malcolm doesn't open
tit.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttBut that's not the end of the trick.
ttWith another magic shake, the penny

tdoesn't open it.

</b>ttBut that's still not the end!...  I

tLynn lays Cole gently on his bed next to his German Shepherd
tPuppy.  Cole curls up with Sebastian.

tLynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment.  Cole is
tcurled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands.  He
tlooks like a four-year-old.  Lynn has been carrying Cole's
tsweater from over her shoulder.  She pulls it off and begins to
tfold it.  Her attention is drawn to the sweater.  She fingers the
tfabric of the back.  IT'S RIPPED.  Her eyes move to Cole.  In the
tmiddle of the back of his T-shirt are THREE SMALL TEARS.  Lynn
tpushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees DEEP FINGERNAIL
tLIKE SCRATCHES on his skin.

tIt's a truly horrific sight.  A BLACK MAN in britches and no

tin a torn white frilly dress -- tears soaking her face, hangs to
tthe right.  A small MIXED RACE CHILD in half pants, hangs to

tHe slowly comes to a stop in front of an old building.  He holds
this arm up.  Uses his other hand to gently touch his hairs on his
tarm's surface.

tthe corners of the historic building...

tthrows his shoe at the power button.

tHe moves to the dinner table where Lynn is seated.  Cole sits.
tHis hands go on the table.  He's wearing a pair of his father's

tCole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home.

tSuddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield.  It's a page

tMalcolm stands on a familiar sidewalk.  He stares into the bay
twindow of Mr. Marschal's brownstone.

tInside the window we see Mr. Marschal seated with a group of
tolder gentlemen his age.  They sit around a table eating
tsandwiches and talking.  Malcolm watches as Mr. Marschal tells a
tstory to his friends.  WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING, but when
the finishes everyone at the table laughs.  Mr. Marschal smiles.

tMalcolm can't help smiling as well.  This is not the same man he
tsaw before.  Life has returned to this house.  Beat.

tMalcolm turns and moves down the street.  Each step faster than
tthe next.

tHis eyes scan the empty seats.  No one in sight in any direction.

tMalcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath.  He holds his
thand to his side as he winces a bit.

tMalcolm's eyes float up to the balcony where toy soldiers sit on
tthe bannister.  Cole's head pops up.

tCole takes a big sigh.  Fiddles with his riflemen.

ttto hurt somebody?

tCole looks nervous.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttHow do you know for sure?

tMalcolm's eyes are drawn to Cole's arm.  Peeking out from under
this shirt sleeve are a set of cuts.  Malcolm gazes at them.

tCole and Malcolm stand silently in the center aisle of the back
tof the church.

tMalcolm moves around the corner on his street.  His mind surges
twith thoughts.  And then he glances up.  His steps slow to a
tcomplete stop.

tFurther down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his
thouse is SEAN.

tMalcolm's face turns to stone.  He watches as Sean comes down the
tfront stairs and starts across the street.

tA sudden rage surges up.  Malcolm moves towards Sean fast.

tSean reaches his car and enters it.  He doesn't notice the figure
tclosing in on him.

tTHE ENGINE STARTS.  Malcolm reaches the car a second late.  Sean
tpulls away into traffic almost hitting another car as he does.

tMalcolm watches the car disappear down the next street.  Beat.

tMalcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and
toverwhelming pain erupting his eyes.

tstatues and pictures.

tCole's eyes open as he hears HIS MOTHER'S DISTANT VOICE.

<b>ttt     LYNN
</b>ttCole...

ttCole, what's happening...

tCole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent.  His foot
tcatches one of the chairs the tent is fastened to.  He stumbles
tout.  He doesn't realize one of the bedsheets comes loose.  It
tfolds to the ground.

tHe doesn't stop as he moves through the shadowy hall and pushes
topen his mother's bedroom door.

</b>
<b>tINT. LYNN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tCole stands in the doorway to his mother's bedroom.  He looks
tover the room carefully.  Everything is still.

tLynn's room is sparse.  No paintings, no accessaries.  A bed
twithout a frame sits in the corner.  A table with a sewing
tmachine fills the other side of the room.

tHIS MOTHER'S VOICE turns his attention back to the bed.

<b>ttt     LYNN
</b>ttCole, what's happening to you?

tCole looks down and finds his mother laying in her bed.  Her face
tcontorted in deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep.

<b>ttt     LYNN
</b>ttIs someone hurting you?...  I'll
ttbeat their asses.

tCole smiles at his mother as he moves to her side.  Touches her
tface with his tiny fingers.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttt(whispers)
ttMomma, you sleep now.

tHis touch seems to have an effect.  Lynn becomes still in her

</b>
tCole closes the door to his mother's bedroom shut.  He stands
tstill in the hallway.  Lets out a heavy sigh...

<b>tHIS BREATH ROLLS IN A TINY CLOUD IN FRONT OF HIM.
</b>
tCole's brow furrows.  He breathes again.  This time
tintentionally.  Watches as his breath materializes in the
tsuddenly ice cold air.

tEvery muscle in Cole's eight-year-old body becomes rigid.  He
ttakes a second before moving through the inky darkness of the
thall.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>

tCole hurries to fix his tent.  He ties the collapsed bedsheet in

tWhen Cole turns around, he stops breathing.

tAN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL VOMITS ON HERSELF IN HIS TENT.  She
tfinishes and looks up at Cole with drawn eyes.

<b>ttt     GIRL
</b>ttI'm feeling much better now.

tThe girl reaches out with her withered and emaciated hands --
ttiny tubes hang from her wrists.  She scratches Cole as he

tCole runs hard out of his bedroom and down the hall to the living

tlegged couch.

tSebastian is already huddled in fear under the couch.  Cole
tpresses as far back as he can and waits.

tCOLE'S P.O.V. -- is of the living room floor.  Chair legs.
tCoffee table base.  Rugs...  Everything is still.

tCole holds his breath.  He waits.  Beat.  Nothing happens.  He
ttakes his first short breaths and watches the room for any sign
tof movement.

tA few minutes later.  Cole is now standing in his doorway.  He
tstares at the hunched figure covered by the collapsed tent.

tBEAT.  Cole makes a decision.  He looks like he is going to cry --
tfights it back.

tHe walks towards it.  Reaches down and slowly pulls the sheet off
tthe figure.  The girl vomits one more time before looking up at
tCole.

<b>ttt     GIRL
</b>ttI'm feeling much better.

tCole and the little girl stare silently at each other.  Cole
tholds her stare with trembling eyes.

tCole's large eyes drink in the passing scenery.

tCOLE'S P.O.V. -- A dark, abandoned building stretches for an
tentire block on one side.  A MAN IN A GREY, FULL-BODIED UNIFORM
<b>tWITH NUMBERS PRINTED ACROSS HIS CHEST...  RISES OUT OF THE TALL

tcarefully.  Rows of parked cars spill out from the driveway onto
tthe streets.

tPeople in suits and dark dresses move somberly in and out of the
tfront door of the home.

tCole and Malcolm join the visitors as they walk slowly towards
tthe doors.

tA frail, little girl about four years of age sits in a dark dress
ton the swings in front of the house.  Visitors say hello to her
tas they pass.  She doesn't say anything back.

tA FAMILY PORTRAIT HANGS NEAR THE FRONT DOOR.  Two girls, one
tbigger, one smaller sit on the ground in front of their mother
tand father.  Their smiling faces welcome the mourners.

tMalcolm and Cole are standing at the bottom of a staircase.
tWaiting.

tThe front door opens as another group arrives.  Malcolm nods to
tCole as the foyer fills up.  The two of them quietly disappear
tupstairs.

tThe narrow hall is lined with boxes of medical supplies.  I.V.
tstands, sterile needles and pads are in the process of being

tCole stares at the shut door like he doesn't want to go in.  His
teyes move to the large, colorful map of the world that dons the
thallway wall.  He gazes at the many countries and continents.

tCole closes the door behind him.  He turns and gazes at the
tgirl's bedroom.  There's a hospital bed near the window.  The
twalls are covered with get-well cards and drawings from family,
tfriends, and school children.

tHer shelves are filled with puppets.  All shapes and sizes of
tpuppets.  Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on
ta mini tripod sitting next to it.

tCole walks to the shelf and picks up a FINGER PUPPET DANCER.  He
tplaces it in his pocket.

tOn the girl's desk, is a large collection of video cassettes.
tThe labels read, "Puppet Show Christmas 96," "Puppet Show
tBirthday party," "Puppet Show class trip"...

tCole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the
tclosets.  He passes the bed.

<b>tAN EMACIATED HAND REACHES OUT FROM BENEATH THE BED AND GRABS

tCole jerks back startled.  He watches as the girl's hand slips
tback under the bed.  Cole stays very still.  Waits.  Nothing
thappens.

tHe slowly bends down.  His hands touch the floor.  He tilts his
thead and looks under the bed.

tThe emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the
tfloor.  Her bulging eyes glare at Cole.  She moves suddenly.
tThrusts a jewelry box forward.  It slides across the wooden floor
tand stops just before Cole.  Cole and the sickly girl stare at

tthrough the room to the kitchen, she receives the many cards,
thugs, and flowers that are offered as condolence.  Mrs. Collins
tleaves the living room.

tMalcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as Cole moves
tthrough the many adults across the room.

tThe girl's father, MR. COLLINS, a thin man in his late twenties,
tis seated on the reading chair next to a T.V.  His face is
tgranite.  No one in the room dares to talk to him.  He stares
tstatue-like at an abstract point in the room.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttMister?

tThe man doesn't react.  Some of the guests look oddly at the
tlittle boy standing before the man.

tnext to him.  Cole is very shaky.

tMalcolm watches everything anxiously.

tCole stares at Mr. Collins.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttAre you Kyra's daddy?

tThe man's face begins to crumble.  Beat.  He nods, "yes" softly.

tThe father just stares at it.  Beat.

tThe father becomes very still.  His eyes fill with a storm of
tconfusion and pain.  After the longest time, the father reaches
tand gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands.

tCole begins to back away...

tThe father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd.  Cole
treaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house.

tThe father looks down in a daze.  He goes to open the jewelry
tbox.  His movements are slow and strained.  He lifts the latch

tAnd then it happens.

tThe image of the mother walks to a closet.  Opens it.  An
tassortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside.
tShe pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner.  Reads the label for the

tChecks it.

</b>
tCole sits on the swings next to Kyra's four-year-old sister.  She
tdoesn't look up.

tMalcolm waits in the driveway.  Watches them from a distance.

tCole reaches into his pocket and pulls out the little FINGER
tPUPPET.  He holds it out.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttYou liked it, she said.

tThe four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes
tit in her small hands.

tThe two children don't say anything for a while.  Malcolm glances
tto the house, where all movements in and out of the home has
tceased.

tCole turns to the four-year-old.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttShe watched out for you.

tThe little girl finally looks up.  She has the saddest eyes.

<b>tttFOUR YEAR OLD
</b>ttKyra's not coming back.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttNot anymore.

tThe little girl stares down at the finger puppet.  Cole lightly
tplaces a hand on her shoulder.

tNothing else is said.  Nothing else is done.

tMalcolm looks across the two children on the swings.  One
tmourning.  One consoling.

tMalcolm takes it in, overwhelmed.

</b>
tStanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop
troom door in the back.  He puts an ear to the door, listens and
tthen knocks.  After a second, he enters.

tMr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a
tFEMALE TEACHER kneels next to him and makes final adjustments.
tCole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham.

</b>ttThey're calling for the stable boy.

tMr. Cunningham looks around the room and then directly at Cole.

<b>ttt     MR. CUNNINGHAM
</b>ttWho were you talking to?

tThe Female Teacher looks to Cole and nods.

<b>ttt     FEMALE TEACHER
</b>ttPoor Stanley.

tShe stands up.  The entire left side of her face has been burnt
thorribly.  Grotesquely disfigured.

tMr. Cunningham smiles.

<b>ttt     MR. CUNNINGHAM
</b>ttYou're welcome, Cole.

tThey share a look before walking out of the prop room and
tentering the hall.

tWe see them walking away.

</b>ttYou know when I was in school,

tscurries up the stairs of the school.

</b>

</b>
tMalcolm stands and catches his breath in the corridor of St.
tAnthony's Academy.

tA teacher rushes in the hall with an armload of costumes.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttHas the play started yet?

tThe teacher hurries past Malcolm and down the hall without saying
ta word.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttIs that a yes?

tThe teacher scurries around a corner.  Malcolm watches her
tcuriously.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON
</b>
tMalcolm moves quickly to a set of double doors and opens them.
tHe steps into the DARKNESS OF THE AUDITORIUM.

tThe play is in full swing...  Cole and a large group of costumed
tchildren are on stage.  Cole holds a broom and wears a worn-down
tcostume.  He stands to the side -- hidden by others.

tA boy in a shiny-armored costume walks to the center of the stage
twhere a large cardboard stone is seated.  A sparkling HANDLE
tsticks out of the top.

tThe armored boy tries to lift it.  It won't budge.

tBobby, the chubby boy from the party, is dressed in a magician's
tcostume.  He is Merlin.  He steps forward.

<b>ttt     MERLIN
</b>ttOnly he who is pure of heart can
tttake the sword from the stone.

tMerlin looks to the group on stage.  Looks right at Cole.

<b>ttt     MERLIN
</b>ttLet the boy try.

tThe group of villagers on the stage LAUGH AND MOCK THE SUGGESTION.

tTommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume -- he hops
taround, clearly embarrassed.

<b>ttt     TOMMY
</b>ttt(half-heartedly)
ttBut he's the stable boy.  He cleans
ttafter the horses.

<b>ttt     MERLIN
</b>ttSilence village idiot!  Let the boy
ttstep forward.

tTommy turns a deep shade of red and hobbles off the stage.

tMerlin looks to Cole.  He smiles a true friend's smile.

<b>ttt     MERLIN
</b>ttArthur...

tCole hesitates.  Not because he's acting.  He really hesitates.
tIt takes him a moment before he steps forward.

tCole steps up to the stone.  He places his hand around the
thandle.  Begins to pull.  The sword starts to come out.

tThe villagers GASP.

tCole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his
thead.

tMerlin and everyone on stage bows.  A SILENCE FILLS THE
<b>tAUDITORIUM.
</b>
tMalcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spot light
tfor the first time.

tThe villagers rise and rush to Cole.  They scoop him up and carry
thim around the stage in celebration.  Cole chuckles and then
tstarts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try
tunsuccessfully to keep him up.  They slowly sag and then
tcollapse.  All the students are laughing as they try to untangle
tthemselves.

tMalcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable
tamong of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying
tthemselves on stage.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

</b>
tThe rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass
twindow.

tMalcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby.  Cole walks back and
tforth in front of him.  Cole still holds the sword from the play.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttHow come we're so quiet?

tMalcolm shrugs his shoulders.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttI think we said everything we

</b>ttAnd you know what else?

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttTommy Tammisimo sucked big time.

tCole smiles huge.  Beat.  Cole's sword drags on the tile as he
tcontinues to circle around the hall.  We get the idea he doesn't
twant to be still.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>tt...Maybe we can pretend we're going
ttto see each other tomorrow?

tCole glances at Malcolm.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttJust for pretend.

tBeat.  Malcolm exhales very slowly as he gets up.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttOkay, Cole, I'm going to go now...
ttI'll see you tomorrow.

tCole watches as Malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance.
tCole stops moving.

<b>ttt     COLE
</b>ttt(soft)
ttSee you tomorrow.

tMalcolm's face shows his losing battle against his emotions.  He
tdoesn't turn to look back.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

<b>tEXT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

tA rain-soaked bridge.  A two-lane road merges to one lane around
ta severe car accident.  A rear-ended car has jumped the sidewalk
tand hit the guard rail of the bridge.  The driver is helped out
tby police.  He's shaken but okay.  Police flares guide the cars
tas they crawl by.

tLynn and Cole are standing still in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

tLynn leans her chin on the steering wheel.  She tries to stare
tthrough the layer of water on the glass.  She hits the windshield
twipers.

twith her palm to see better.

tLynn begins to cry.

</b>ttShe said, you came to her where

tLynn covers her face with her hands.  The tears roll out through

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tMalcolm enters the living room and smiles at what he sees.

tAnna is asleep in a chair.  She's curled up in a ball.  In a way,
tshe looks like a little girl.

tTheir WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS SOFTLY ON THE TELEVISION.

tMalcolm watches himself and Anna cutting their wedding cake.  THE
<b>tCROWD APPLAUDS AS THEY FEED EACH OTHER PIECES.
</b>
tMalcolm turns from the television and takes a seat next to Anna.
tHe gazes upon his wife softly.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttt(whispers)
ttAnna, I've been so lost.
ttt(beat)
ttI need my best friend.

tSilence.  Malcolm gazes for a beat before looking down.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttI miss you.

tMalcolm's eyes move back up.  He looks at his sleeping wife.
<b>tANNA'S TALKING IN HER SLEEP.
</b>
tMalcolm can't believe it.

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttI miss you.

tBeat.  Her lips move again.  Eyes never open.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttWhy, Malcolm?

</b>ttWhat, Anna?  What did I do?  What's

tBeat.

<b>ttt     ANNA
</b>ttWhy did you leave me?

<b>ttt     MALCOLM
</b>ttI didn't leave you.

tBeat.  She becomes silent.  Anna falls back into deep sleep, her
tarm slides down.  SOMETHING SHINY FALLS OUT AND ROLLS ON THE
<b>tGROUND.
</b>
tMalcolm's eyes watch as it comes to a stop...  Beat.  He gazes
tcuriously at a GOLD WEDDING BAND laying on the wood floor.

tConfusion washes over his face.  He looks to Anna's hand...  An
tidentical gold wedding ring sits on her finger.

tBeat.  Malcolm looks down at his own hand...  HIS WEDDING RING IS
<b>tGONE.
</b>
tMalcolm is completely lost.  He takes a couple steps back.  Looks
taround in confusion...

tHis eyes come to rest on the door to his basement office.  He
tlooks in disbelief at the set of DEAD BOLT LOCKS on the door.

tMalcolm doesn't know what the hell's going on...  His eyes are
tdrawn to the dining table...  Only ONE PLACE SETTING is out on
tthe tabletop.

tHis eyes search again -- they finally lock on the WEDDING VIDEO
tPLAYING.  Malcolm watches images of himself on the screen...  His
teyes fill with a storm of emotions...

tMalcolm looks to Anna's face and becomes very still.  Beat.

</b>
tAnna rushes across the room to a crumpled Malcolm laying on the
tfloor.  Malcolm's hands are clutched at his side.

tAnna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his
tshirt.  Anna's eyes catch something dark -- moving...  A POOL OF
tBLOOD IS FORMING UNDER MALCOLM.  She slowly turns him over on his
tside...  A horrific sight...  An enormous exit wound on his lower
tback pours out blood uncontrollably.

tMalcolm's jaw is locked open.  His breaths are long and strained.

<b>tANNA IS SCREAMING, BUT HER VOICE SOUNDS FAR AWAY.
</b>
tMalcolm's open jaw releases a long strained breath and then
tbecomes silent.  Anna tries to cover the wound with her hands

</b>ttGoodnight, sweetheart.

tThe room falls into silence.  Malcolm sits still across from his

tMalcolm leans back in the chair.  Slowly closes his eyes.  They
tclose shut.
