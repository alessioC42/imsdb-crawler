<b>EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY
</b>
Security men and porters are loading wagons for a convoy.
As they work, we see across the lake a lone horseman entering
the village.  One of the men recognizes him.

<b>ttttWORKER
</b>ttMaster Li is here!

ANGLE ON: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and handsome.

In the background, old Aunt Wu, at the sight of Li Mu Bai,
drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building.

<b>INT. YUAN HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Aunt Wu runs hurriedly through the halls.

<b>ttttAUNT WU
</b>ttShu Lien!

<b>INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
Yu, a beautiful woman in her early 30s, is finishing packing
for the convoy, wrapping a few small items in a linen
wrapper, as Aunt Wu bursts in.

<b>ttttAUNT WU
</b>ttLi Mu Bai is here!

<b>INT. YUAN PRACTICE HALL - DAY
</b>
<b>ttttLI
</b>ttHow's everything?

<b>ttttAUNT WU
</b>ttFine.  Please come in.

Yu sits, composed, as Aunt Wu ushers Li in.  Li carries a
large object, wrapped in silk.

Yu smiles.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttMu Bai...It's been too long.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttIt has.
ttt(he glances around
tttthe room)
ttHow's business?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttGood.  And how are you?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttFine.

An awkward pause.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttMonk Zheng said you were at Wudan
ttMountain.  He said you were
ttpracticing deep meditation.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThe mountain must be so peaceful...
ttI envy you.  My work keeps me so
ttbusy, I hardly get any rest.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI left the training early.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWhy?  You're a Wudan fighter.
ttTraining is everything.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttDuring my meditation training... I
ttcame to a place of deep silence...
ttI was surrounded by light... Time
ttand space disappeared.  I had come
ttto a place my master had never told
ttme about.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou were enlightened?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttNo.  I didn't feel the bliss of
ttenlightenment.  Instead... I was
ttsurrounded by an endless sorrow.  I
ttcouldn't bear it.  I broke off my
ttmeditation.  I couldn't go on.
ttThere was something... pulling me
ttback.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWhat was it?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttSomething I can't let go of.  You
ttare leaving soon?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWe're preparing a convoy for a
ttdelivery to Peking.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttPerhaps I could ask you to deliver
ttsomething to Sir Te for me.

Li unwraps the object.  It is an ancient, astonishingly
beautiful sword.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThe Green Destiny Sword?  You're
ttgiving it to Sir Te?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI am.  He has always been our
ttgreatest protector.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI don't understand.  How can you
ttpart with it?  It has always been
ttwith you.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttToo many men have died at its edge.
ttIt only looks pure because blood
ttwashes so easily from its blade.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou use it justly, you're worthy of
ttit.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttIt's time for me to leave it behind.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttSo what will you do now?

Li doesn't reply.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttCome with me to Peking.  You can
ttgive the sword to Sir Te yourself.
ttIt'll be just like old times.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttFirst I must visit my master's
ttgrave.  It's been many years since
ttJade Fox murdered him.  I have yet
ttto avenge his death.  And yet I'm
ttthinking of quitting.  I must pray
ttfor his forgiveness.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttJoin me once you have finished.  I
ttcan wait for you in Peking.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttPerhaps.

<b>EXT. THE GATE TO PEKING. DAY
</b>
Customs officials have just finished checking the contents
in a row of carriages bearing the Sun Security insignia.
The caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the
boundaries of Peking.  Yu, riding a handsome horse and
clearly the leader, watches as her crew clears inspection.

<b>ttttGUARDS
</b>ttOk.  Pass.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThanks.  Let's go into the city.

<b>EXT. OUTSIDE A DEPOT. DAY
</b>
Workers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages.
Boss Giao is checking off the merchandise -- a cargo of
medicinal herbs.

<b>ttttGIAO
</b>ttEverything got here safely.  I'm
ttmuch obliged.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttJust doing my job.

<b>ttttGIAO
</b>ttSun Security has been the best
ttsince your father started it.
ttYou're a credit to his memory.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThank you.

<b>ttttGIAO
</b>ttI mean it.

<b>EXT. DAY. PEKING
</b>
From a gray tiled roof, we can see Peking's magnificent grid
of houses extending miles and miles out, freshly painted by
the morning sun.

<b>EXT. PEKING STREET. DAY
</b>
Dusty and congested as always, people, horses, and carriages
are fighting to get through the boulevards.

A group of jugglers perform at a corner.

Yu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse.

<b>INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY
</b>
Yu presents the sword to Sir Te.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttThis is Li's personal sword, a
ttgreat hero's weapon!  He is the
ttonly one in the world worthy of
ttcarrying it.  It's too fine a gift.
ttI cannot accept it.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttSir Te!  It has brought him as much
tttrouble as glory.  Help him to
ttleave these troubles behind.
ttOtherwise, he'll never be able to
ttstart anew.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttAll right.  I'll act as the sword's
ttcustodian.

De Lu, the head servant, enters.

<b>ttttDE LU
</b>ttGovernor Yu has arrived.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttI must change.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttt(getting up)
ttYou've always been so good to Li Mu
ttBai and me.  Please accept our
ttthanks.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttPlease do not be such a stranger.
ttYou'll stay the night as my guest.
ttNow, Shu Lien... tell me something.
ttAnd forgive me for prying.  Your
ttfather was a great friend to me,
ttand I think of you as my own
ttdaughter.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttPlease, Sir Te, what is it?

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttLi Mu Bai giving up his sword and
tthis warrior days... maybe he's
tttrying to tell you something?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI don't know...

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttDon't be coy.  I've always known
ttabout your feelings for each other.
ttAll these years, it's a shame...
ttneither of you is brave enough to
ttadmit the truth to the other.
ttYou're both wasting precious time.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I
ttaren't cowards.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttWhen it comes to emotions, even
ttgreat heroes can be idiots.  Tell
ttme if Li Mu Bai is not more open
ttthe next time you see him.  I'll
ttgive him an earful!

<b>INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY
</b>
Yu and De Lu approach the study.

<b>ttttDE LU
</b>ttSir Te said to leave the sword in
tthere.

De Lu opens the door and is startled to find a young woman
inside.  The woman is studying the sheets of calligraphy
hanging on the walls.

<b>ttttDE LU
</b>ttWho are you?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI'm your guest today.  I am Governor
ttYu's daughter.

<b>ttttDE LU
</b>ttThis is Sir Te's study.  You are
tthere to...

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI was looking for a quiet corner.

<b>ttttDE LU
</b>ttI am Sir Te's head servant.  And
ttthis is another of our guests.

<b>INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY
</b>
Yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttIt's heavy for such a thin piece of
ttmetal!

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThe handle is heavy.  And the blade
ttis no ordinary metal.  Still, the
ttsword is the lightest of weapons.
ttYou're just not used to handling it.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttBut I have had much practice.  As a
ttchild in the West, a platoon lived
ttwith us.  They'd let me play with
tttheir weapons.  The scabbard is so
ttbeautiful.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttBeautiful but dangerous.  Once you
ttsee it tainted with blood, its
ttbeauty is hard to admire.  It's 400
ttyears old.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttExquisite!  You said it belongs to...

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttMy friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it
ttto Sir Te as a gift.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttLi Mu Bai!  The famous warrior?
ttWhy would he give his sword to Sir
ttTe?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou're too young to understand.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou're a sword fighter too?

Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath.  An eerie sound
resonates within the study.  Jen is even more impressed.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYes, I am.  But I prefer the
ttmachete.  Certain moves, however,
ttcall for a sword.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttReally?

Yu puts the sword back in the case.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttt(longingly)
ttIt must be exciting to be a fighter,
ttto be totally free!

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttFighters have rules too: friendship,
tttrust, integrity... Without rules,
ttwe wouldn't survive for long.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI've read all about people like you.
ttRoaming wild, beating up anyone who
ttgets in your way!

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWriters wouldn't sell many books if
ttthey told how it really is.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttBut you're just like the characters
ttin the stories.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttSure.  No place to bathe for days,
ttsleeping in flea-infested beds...
ttThey tell you all about that in
ttthose books?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou know what I mean.  I'm getting
ttmarried soon, but I haven't lived
ttthe life I want.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttSo I heard.  Congratulations.  It's
ttthe most important step in a
ttwoman's life, isn't it?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou're not married, are you?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWhat do you think?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttNo!  You couldn't roam around
ttfreely if you were.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou're probably right.

Yu studies Jen.  The room falls silent for a moment.

<b>EXT. SIDE COURT YARD - DAY
</b>
It's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple.  Jen
is leaving the study escorted by her maid.  She turns to Yu
for a final good-bye.  Yu seems intrigued by the encounter.

<b>EXT. SIR TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Two lighted lanterns are raised up.

<b>INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
Sir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttGo ahead, Governor Yu.

Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the
sword.  He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword.
Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword
out from its sheath.  The sword gives off a luminous blue
glow in the dark.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttTwo feet 9 inches long.  1 inch
ttwide.  The handle is 1 inch deep,
tt2.6 inches wide.  Seven-tenths of
ttan inch thick.  With seven rubies
ttmissing from the hilt.  You can
tttell the design dates back to
ttbefore the Chin era.  Engraved with
tta technique lost by the time of the
ttHan Dynasty.

<b>ttttGOVERNOR YU
</b>ttYour knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttA sword by itself rules nothing.
ttIt comes alive only through skillful
ttmanipulation.

<b>ttttGOVERNOR YU
</b>ttI see your point.  Please continue.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttThe Imperial Court isn't the
ttproblem.  With royalty and officials
tteverywhere, the Royal Guard keeps
ttsecurity tight.  But Peking is not
ttlike the West.  Here, you'll find
ttall sorts of characters.  Proceed
ttwith caution in your quest for law
ttand order.  Don't depend only on
ttthe court.  Contacts in the Giang
ttHu underworld can ensure your
ttposition.  Be strong, yet supple.
ttThis is the way to rule.

<b>INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for Jen, then
walks over to Jen and helps remove her earrings.  Someone
knocks and the maid goes to answer the door.

<b>ttttMAID
</b>ttGoverness...

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttLet me do it.

The maid leaves as the governess enters the room.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttPlease sit.

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttI've made you silk pajamas.  Do you
ttwant to change into them?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttPut them down.

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttI heard you met Shu Lien today.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttDo you know her?

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttShe's one of those.  Your mother
ttwould not want you consorting with
tther kind.

Jen shoots her an angry look.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI'll socialize with whomever I
ttplease.

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttDon't invite danger into your
ttfather's house.

She's about to say something, then thinks better of it.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI'm tired now.

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttGo to bed then.  Miss has grown up,
ttand is getting married soon.  God
ttknows what the future will bring.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttIt will be just the same.  Enough!
ttI'm tired.

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttAutumn is coming.  I'll shut the
ttwindows for you.

The governess leaves.  Jen sits on the side of her bed,
thinking.

<b>EXT. TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
A wide shot of the compound.  A patrol man greets Master Bo,
Sir Te's head of security.  The place is serene.

<b>ttttMASTER BO
</b>ttChilly, eh?

<b>ttttNIGHTMAN
</b>ttYes, Master Bo.

As Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background.

<b>EXT./INT. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF TE'S STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
A masked figure silently opens the window and enters the
room.  It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and
wraps the sword.

Bo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling.  The
thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard.  Bo tries to
stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the
roof as Bo yells out.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttSomeone help!  Stop him!  He's on
ttthe roof!  The sword's been stolen!
ttStop thief!  Stop him!

The thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street.

Bo grabs a pole and runs, as gongs begin to sound, alerting
people to the theft.  People rush outside, Yu Shu Lien among
them.

<b>EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Bo runs through the streets.  The thief is nowhere in sight.
Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing.  Bo hurries
towards the source.

<b>EXT. AN ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two
other fighters -- Tsai (male, 40s) and May, his daughter.

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttIt's Jade Fox!

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttWe must avenge mother!

The hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over
a wall, just as Bo arrives.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttDo something!  He's getting away!

<b>EXT. PEKING ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</b>
The thief runs atop a roof -- right into Yu.  Yu and the
hooded figure face off.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttReturn the sword, and I'll let you
ttgo.

The figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight.

Yu attacks, but the figure repels her.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou've been trained at Wudan?

The figure answers by leaping to another rooftop.  Yu
catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series
of lightning-quick blows.

<b>EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Bo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away.

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttYou're mistaken.  We're just street
ttperformers.  We were rehearsing.

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttFather!

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttYou were rehearsing?  Who are you
tttrying to fool?

May wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai.  They run
off.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttWhere did that thief go?

Bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into
Governor Yu's compound.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttGovernor Yu's house!

<b>EXT. ROOF TOP
</b>
Yu and the Black Figure continue to fight.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttGet down here!  Give back the sword!

<b>EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S - NIGHT
</b>
Yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief.
A small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu.
She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity
to get away.

Yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the
empty courtyard.

<b>EXT. TE'S SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY
</b>
De Lu escorts Yu into Te's.

<b>ttttDE LU
</b>ttSir Te awaits you.

<b>INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY
</b>
Men are standing at attention.  Bo is giving his account of
what happened, as Yu enters.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttI'm sure the thief is in the Yu
tthousehold.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttHow dare you imply?

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttBut I say --

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>tt-- Enough.

The men hustle out.  Bo can barely contain his frustration.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttHas Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttYes, though I doubt he's involved
ttin this.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttBut the sword could be in his
ttcompound.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttThen someone's trying to set him up.
ttWe should inform Li Mu Bai.

<b>EXT. OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Madam Yu is returning from temple.  The governess is helping
her out of the carriage.  Servants are peeling bills off a
wall across the street.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttWhat is it?

<b>ttttMAID
</b>ttMadam Yu, someone's put up posters.

A partially torn flyer with the words "Jade Fox will not
escape justice!" is seen on the ground.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttLet me see.

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttSomeone is after Jade Fox.
ttPreposterous, looking for her here!

Madam Yu nods and walks inside, as the Governess tosses the
flyer away and follows her.

A hand scoops up the flyer -- it is Yu.  She studies it,
then puts it in her pocket, and moves on.

<b>EXT. BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
Bo is searching for the Tsais.  The bridge is full of
jugglers.  But the two are nowhere to be found.

<b>EXT. PEKING STREET - DAY
</b>
Bo quizzes a homeless man.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttWhere are they?

<b>ttttHOMELESS MAN
</b>ttI don't know.  I haven't seen them
ttin two days.

Bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees May walking
quickly into an alley.  Bo follows her.

<b>EXT. IN FRONT OF TSAI'S HOUSE
</b>
May walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken-
down bamboo fence.  Bo inches closer and sees May and Tsai
oiling their weapons.

<b>INT. BO'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
Jen practices calligraphy.  The governess is by her side
embroidering and throwing occasional glances at Jen.  The
maid enters.

<b>ttttMAID
</b>ttThere is a Miss Shu Lien here to
ttsee you.

Jen stops and looks up at them.

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttMiss is busy right now.

<b>ttttMAID
</b>ttI'll tell her.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttShow her in.

The governess shoots her a look.

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttThis spells trouble.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI have a guest.

The governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows Yu in.

<b>ttttMAID
</b>ttThis way please.

The governess and Yu exchange quick glances.  The governess
bows slightly and departs.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI've missed you.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttHow so?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI'm bored.

Yu sees the calligraphy.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou're doing calligraphy?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI'll write your name.  Just for fun.

Jen writes Yu's name with great confidence and swiftness.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI never realized my name looks like
tt"sword."

Jen freezes slightly.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou write gracefully.  Calligraphy
ttis so similar to fencing.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttMaybe it is.  I wouldn't know.

The maid enters with tea.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttPlease.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThank you for seeing me.  I hear
ttyour wedding day is near.  You must
ttbe overwhelmed by the preparations.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI'm hardly doing a thing.  The less
ttI think of it the better.  My
ttparents are arranging everything.
ttThe Gous are a very powerful family.
ttMy marrying one will be good for my
ttfather's career.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou are fornuate to marry into such
tta noble family.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttAm I?  I wish I were like the
ttheroes in the books I read.  Like
ttyou and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm
tthappy to be marrying.  But to be
ttfree to live my own life, to choose
ttwhom I love... That is true
tthappiness.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttDo you think so?  Let me tell you a
ttstory.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttAbout you and Li Mu Bai?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYes.  Did you know I was once
ttengaged to be married?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttNo, really?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttHis name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was
tta brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.
ttOne day, while in battle, he was
ttkilled by the sword of Li Mu Bai's
ttenemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went
ttthrough a lot together.  Our
ttfeelings for each other grew
ttstronger.  But how could we dishonor
ttMeng's memory?  So the freedom you
tttalk about, I too desire it.  But I
tthave never tasted it.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttToo bad for Meng, but it's not your
ttfault, or Li Mu Bai's.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI am not an aristocrat, as you
ttare... but I must still respect a
ttwoman's duties.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttDon't distance us.  From now on,
ttlet's be like sisters.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThen as a sister, let me wish you
tthappiness in your marriage.

<b>EXT. YU'S GARDEN - DAY
</b>
The maid escorts Yu out.  Yu pauses, looks around, and sees
the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a
corner.

<b>INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Moonlight spills into the room, as Jen rises sleeplessly
from bed and looks out the window.  A light breeze stirs her
hair.  The sound of the wind rises, and slowly her face
dissolves, into...

<b>INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY
</b>
...the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she
lets the dry desert air flow through her hair.  She sits in
a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback,
that is traveling through the spectacular desert.  Across
from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttWhat a godforsaken place!  Can't
ttyour father be appointed closer to
ttcivilization?  Jen... are you
ttlistening to me?

Jen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a
beautiful mountainside.

<b>INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Jen sighs, and turns back toward her bed.

<b>EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Tsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a
tree, watching Jen.

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttLet's go!

They drop down silently and walk away.  From another rooftop,
Lo looks silently on.

<b>EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Tsai and May enter the house.

<b>INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Inside the tiny house, they discover a hooded figure going
through their belongings.

Immediately Tsai throws a knife, which rips off the figure's
mask -- revealing Bo.  Tsai has another long knife at his
throat.

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttWho are you?

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttWait!  I'm a friend!

Tsai pauses.

<b>INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)
</b>
May fans a small coal-fired grill that is boiling a sizzling
pot of vegetable and meatball soup.  Her father and Bo are
now friendly dinner companions, much to May's delight.

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttI don't care about your sword.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttWhy were you spying on the Yus?

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttI'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox.
ttI'm a police inspector from Shaan
ttXi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a
ttmaster criminal.  I hear she
ttinfiltrated the Yus.  She must have
ttcome with them when they transferred
tthere.  But with Yu's reputation, I
ttcan't just go in and accuse her.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttThis Jade Fox is a woman?

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttThen leave her to me.

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttPardon me, but I doubt you can
tthandle her.  My wife was quite a
ttmartial arts expert.  Jade Fox
ttkilled her.  So you see, this is
ttpersonal.  Leave her to me.

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttIt's ready!
ttt(re: the soup)


<b>ttttBO
</b>ttI'm ready for anything!

Bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks.  May intercepts
him with her own chopsticks.

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttFather gets first dip.

Tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a
meatball but to catch an incoming dart.  A dart wrapped with
a note.  Bo jumps up.

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttThey're gone.

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttWhat does it say?

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>tt"We'll settle this at midnight on
ttYellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out
ttof her hole.

<b>INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
Yu is ushered into the room, to discover Sir Te talking to
another man, whose back is to her.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttShu Lien, look who's here.

The man turns around -- it's Li Mu Bai.

<b>EXT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT
</b>
Yu and Li Mu Bai sit together.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttSir Te believes it's a ploy cast
ttsuspicion on Governor Yu.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttBut something is going on at the Yu
tthousehold.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttWhat have you discovered?

From her sleeve, Yu removes the flyer.  Li takes it, his
face darkening.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttJade Fox?  Impossible.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou always suspected she'd fled to
ttthe West.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI didn't think she'd dare come back
ttto Peking!

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttIs there any place safer than under
ttthe nose of Governor Yu?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttSo I shall avenge my master's death
ttafter all.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttBe careful.  Sir Te requires
ttdiscretion.  Official business is
ttdifficult enough.  Don't let
ttpersonal feelings make it worse.
ttAnd I don't know... even this
ttposter... could be some sort of trap.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttDid you see who posted it?

Yu pauses.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttIt says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.
ttOn the night of the theft there was
tta brawl near Yu's.  Were you
ttinvolved?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttIt was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he
ttfollowed the thief to the Yus'.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttHave you questioned him yet?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttNo, not yet...

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttBut your men are watching over Yu's
ttcompund?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttNo, I'd already sent them home.
ttYou can blame me for losing the
ttsword, but please trust that I'll
ttget it back soon using my own
ttmethods.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttThat's not what I meant.  I don't
ttcare about the sword.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWhat do you mean?  Didn't you come
ttback here for it?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI don't know it was stolen until I
ttgot here.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThen, why did you come?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttWell, we had talked...

De Lu enters.

<b>ttttDE LU
</b>ttPardon my intrusion.  Master Li,
ttyour room is ready.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttThank you.  Please lead the way.

<b>EXT. YELLOW HILL - NIGHT
</b>
Tsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree.  Bo stifles a
yawn.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttThe fox doesn't care much for
ttpunctuality.  Still no sign of her.

An old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over
her face, holding a cane.  The three exchange glances.

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttEnough!  Show yourself.

The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her
disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttTsai... you dog!  You will pay for
ttyour stubbornness.

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttThat's what you think, old witch!

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttIf you surrender now, you'll suffer
ttless.  But if you resist, I won't
ttstop until you're dead.

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttFather!  Let me avenge my mother's
ttdeath.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttYou'll soon end up like her, you
ttlittle whore!

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttYou'll pay for that!

A fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and
Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when
the opportunity presents itself.

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttt(to Bo)
ttShe's going to paralyze you!

Using acupressure, Fox disables Bo.  May shoots an arrow at
her, but she catches it and flings it back, hitting May.

<b>ttttTSAI
</b>ttMay!

Fox then disables Tsai, but just as she goes for the kill,
Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttTsai, you filthy mongrel!  An ambush!

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttFather, are you all right?

Li addresses Fox.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttWudan should have gotten rid of you
ttlong ago.  It's been a long time,
ttJade Fox!  You don't remember me...
ttBut you should remember my master.
ttYou infiltrated Wudan while I was
ttaway.  You stole our master!  Now
ttit's time for you to pay!

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttYour master underestimated us women.
ttSure, he'd sleep with me, but he
ttwould never teach me.  He deserved
ttto die by a woman's hand!

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttYou stole the secrets of Wudan's
tthighest martial arts.  But after
ttten years of training, your moves
ttare still undisciplined.  And
tttoday, under a Wudan sword... you
ttwill die!

Li easily brings Fox to the ground.

Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox.  A figure masked
in black appears next to Fox, sword extended, saving her.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttDisciple, we'll kill them all!

<b>ttttFIGURE IN BLACK
</b>ttLet's go!

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttAnother one!

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttI must get rid of Tsai!

Fox fights Tsai, Bo, and May, as Li addresses the masked
figure.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttWho are you?  Why is the Green
ttDestiny in your possession?

<b>ttttFIGURE IN BLACK
</b>ttWhat's it to you?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttMy name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green
ttDestiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be
ttyour master.  Where did you learn
ttthat "Xuan Piu" move?

<b>ttttFIGURE IN BLACK
</b>ttI'm just playing around.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttTell me, who is your master?

<b>ttttFIGURE IN BLACK
</b>ttLet's go!

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttWe must kill them!

Tsai throws his blade at Fox, who catches it and throws it
back, hitting him in the head.  Fox and the masked figure
leap away.

May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head.
Bo kneels beside her.

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttFather!

<b>EXT. TE'S - DAY
</b>
Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed
from over the body of Tsai.  Bo and May stand before them.

<b>ttttTE
</b>ttThis is Tsai?

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttMy father.  Police Inspector from
ttShaan.

<b>ttttTE
</b>ttThis should be reported to Governor
ttYu.  The victim is an officer.  You
ttbelieve the killer is hiding out in
tthis compound.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI'd bet my life on it!

<b>ttttTE
</b>ttt(to Li and Yu)
ttCome with me.

He exits the room.

<b>INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY
</b>
Te, Li, and Yu are seated.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttThis needs to be resolved, and
ttquickly.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI'll get into the Yu household and
ttget her.  I'll ferret out Fox and
tther gang.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWe must be careful.  Governor Yu is
tta court official, and in charge of
ttsecurity.  Any disturbance will
ttcast suspicion on him.  It might
ttget Sir Te in trouble.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttThis is a delicate matter.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttSir Te, can you find some excuse to
ttinvite Madam Yu and her daughter?

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttWhat do you have in mind?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThe best way to trap a fox is
ttthrough her cubs.

Sir Te and Li look puzzled.

<b>EXT. SIR TE'S GARDEN - DAY
</b>
Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen.  They busy themselves with
various items for her trousseau.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttMadam Te is certainly spoiling us
ttwith these wedding gifts.  She's
ttbeing so considerate.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI'm sorry she's not feeling well
ttenough to receive you today.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttI heard Sir Te lost something.  And
ttnow Madame Te's not feeling well...

Jen sits silently reading.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWe know who stole the missing item.
ttIf the thief returns it, I'm sure
ttSir Te will pursue the matter no
ttfurther.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttThat's good.  Sometimes the help
ttcan't keep their hands to themselves.
ttIt's very embarassing.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttSir Te knows that even well-meaning
ttpeople can make mistakes... that
ttcan bring ruin to themselves and
tttheir families.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttBut don't be too lenient.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttNo mercy will be shown toward the
ttmurderer who turned up in Peking.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttA murderer?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYes.  The very killer of Li Mu
ttBai's own master.  Last night, she
ttkilled a policeman who had tracked
tther down.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttA female criminal!  Now that's news!

Jen becomes visibly upset.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou say she killed a policeman?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYes, from the West.  He went
ttundercover and and followed her
tthere,

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttMaybe the murderer and the thief
ttare one and the same.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI doubt it.  This thief... it very
ttunusual...

As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea.
As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the
pot slips from her hand.  Without even looking down, Jen
instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move.

<b>ttttYU
</b>tt...And most likely smarter than a
ttmere killer.

Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttt(formal)
ttGreetings, Sir Te.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttHello, Madam Yu.  This is Li Mu
ttBai, the renowned swordsman.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttDelighted to meet you.

Li sizes Jen up.

<b>ttttTE
</b>ttMiss Yu is soon to be married.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttCongratulations.

<b>EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
May opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard.

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttWhy don't you come in?

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttI'm standing guard.

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttCome in.  It's cold.

She turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him.

<b>ttttMAY
</b>ttCome in.  We don't have to fear
ttJade Fox if we're together.

<b>EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
A still, dark night.

<b>EXT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
Something moves in the moonlight.  A hooded figure jumps down.

Li Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttIsn't it a bit too late to be out?
ttYou've brought me the sword?

<b>ttttFIGURE
</b>ttI do as I please.

The masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with
incredible speed and grabs the sword from her.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttWhere's your master?

<b>ttttFIGURE
</b>ttWhat's it to you?

The figure floats away.  Li chases after her.

<b>EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT
</b>
The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops,
displaying amazing floating skills.

<b>INT. ABANDONED MONASTERY - NIGHT
</b>
The figure bounces into an old monastery.  Li is already
there.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttHad enough flying?  You've got
ttpotential.  You've studied the
ttWudan Manual but you don't
ttunderstand it.  You need a real
ttmaster.

The figure doesn't respond, but we sense the pride in her
eyes.

<b>ttttFIGURE
</b>ttDo you think you are a real master?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttLike most things, I am nothing.
ttIt's the same for this sword.  All
ttof it is simply a state of mind.

<b>ttttFIGURE
</b>ttStop talking like a monk!  Just
ttfight!

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttThen tell me where Jade Fox is.

<b>ttttFIGURE
</b>ttOn guard!

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttReal sharpness comes without effort.

<b>EXT. MONASTERY - NIGHT
</b>
The figure leaps into the garden, but again, Li is ahead of
her.

The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her.
Frustrated, the figure intensifies her attack.

The figure, losing composure, attacks wildly.  Li gets even
more elusive, using a branch to repel her.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttNo growth without assistant.  No
ttaction without reaction.  No desire
ttwithout restraint.  Now give
ttyourself up and find yourself again.
ttThere is a lesson for you.

Li now holds the stick to her mask, gently raising it
slightly.

<b>ttttFIGURE
</b>ttGo ahead.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttWhy should I?  You need practice.
ttI can teach you to fight with the
ttGreen Destiny, but first you must
ttlearn to hold it in stillness.

<b>ttttFIGURE
</b>ttWhy do you want to teach me?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI've always wanted a disciple
ttworthy of Wudan's secrets.

<b>ttttFIGURE
</b>ttAnd if I use them to kill you?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttThat's a risk I'm willing to take.
ttDeep down, you're good.  Even Jade
ttFox couldn't corrupt you.

The figure's eyes cloud with tears.

<b>ttttFIGURE
</b>ttWudan is a whorehouse!  Keep your
ttlessons!

The figure swirls and takes off, leaving a rueful Li standing
alone in the monastery.

<b>INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Jen slips in through the window.  She pulls off her mask, as
she spots the Governess/Fox sitting and sewing.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttYou're home late... or should I say
ttearly?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttWhy are you still here?  You killed
tta policeman.  You should leave!
ttYou'll bring ruin on my whole family.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttThey wouldn't have found me if you
tthadn't stolen the sword.  Like a
ttlittle girl, you thought stealing
ttwould be fun?  You, too, are
ttresponsible for that death.  Come
ttwith me.  You don't want to waste
ttyour life as the wife of some
ttbureaucrat.  Denied your talent...
ttAs a master and disciple we will
ttrule.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI'll never live as a thief!

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttYou're already a thief.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttThat was just for fun.  How can I
ttleave?  Where would I go?

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttWherever we want.  We'll get rid of
ttanyone in our way.  Even your father.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttShut up!

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttIt's the Giang Hu fighter
ttlifestyle... kill or be killed.
ttExciting, isn't it?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI owe you nothing.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttYes, you do!  You are still my
ttdisciple.

Jen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few
blows.  Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's
pressure points, disabling her.  Jen pushes her across the
room.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou think you've been teaching me
ttall these years from the manual?
ttYou couldn't even decipher the
ttsymbols!

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttI studied the diagrams.  But you
tthid the details!

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou wouldn't have understood, even
ttif I had tried to explain.  You
ttknow... you've gone as far as you
ttcan go.  I hid my skills so as not
ttto hurt you.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttIf I hadn't seen you fight with Li
ttMu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of
ttall you've hidden from me.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttMaster... I started learning from
ttyou in secret when I was 10.  You
ttenchanted me with the world of
ttGiang Hu.  But once I realized I
ttcould surpass you, I became so
ttfrightened!  Everything fell apart.
ttI had no one to guide me, no one to
ttlearn from.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttBelieve me, I've a lesson or two
ttleft to teach you!

Fox exits.

<b>EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S GATE - DAY
</b>
The Governess leaves, a small sack over her back.

<b>EXT. TE'S COURTYARD - DAY
</b>
Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand, beautifully
at ease with the weapon.  He spins around to find Yu standing
in the doorway.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThe sword is back... are you happy?

Li smiles.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI admit, getting it back makes me
ttrealize how much I'd missed it.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttBut it's not your sword anymore.
ttYou gave it to Sir Te.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttTrue.  But I must borrow it for one
ttlast mission.  Jade Fox must die at
ttits edge.  Did you know what you
ttwere hiding when you covered for
ttthat girl?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttMy job was to get the sword back,
ttwithout embarassing anyone.  I
ttwasn't about to ruin her life, or
tther father's.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttYou did your job well.  But, this
ttgirl... I saw her last night.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI knew she would intrigue you.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttShe needs direction... and training.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttShe's an aristocrat's daughter.
ttShe's not one of us.  In any case,
ttit will all be over soon.  You'll
ttkill Fox, and she'll marry.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttThat's not for her.  She should
ttcome to Wudan and become a disciple.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttBut Wudan does not accept women.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttFor her, they might make an
ttexception.  If not, I'm afraid
ttshe'll become a poisoned dragon.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttIt's not our affair.  Even if Wudan
ttaccepts her, her husband might
ttobject.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI thought by giving away the sword,
ttI could escape the Giang Hu world.
ttBut the cycle of bloodshed continues.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI wish there were something more I
ttcould do to help you.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttJust be patient with me, Shu Lien.

<b>INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Jen is asleep.  A noise awakens her.

Lo opens the window and sneaks in -- right into the point of
Jen's waiting sword.

Jen's sword drops to the ground.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttLo?

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttJen!

Lo grabs her by the wrist.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou shouldn't have come.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttWith all the traffic on your

ttwhile to get in here.  I can't wait
ttany longer.  I was wrong to let you

tthappy in the desert.  You'll be

Jen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms
again.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou've been looking for me all this
tttime?

<b>FLASHBACK: FOUR YEARS EARLIER
</b>
<b>INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY
</b>
Jen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it.  Jen
admires the piece, her most prized possession.

Madam Yu sits opposite her.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttJen... stop playing with it.

Jen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the
sky darkens.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI won't break it.

<b>EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY
</b>
Lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan.

<b>ttttGUARD A
</b>ttIt's Dark Cloud!  Dark Cloud is
ttcoming!

His warning is useless.  From Jen's pov, we see the guards
slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords.

<b>ttttMADAM YU
</b>ttLower the shade, don't let them see
ttyou!

<b>ttttDARK CLOUD (LO)
</b>ttDon't touch the women!

Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints.  Lo approaches
the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand.

She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down
and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse
flails beside him.

She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their
escape on horseback.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttLet's go!

<b>EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
Jen and Lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttCome get your comb.

She tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and
flings her off her horse.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttHurry back to your mother.

Lo rides on as she charges after her horse.

<b>EXT. DESERT BLUFF - DAY
</b>
A group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up,
keeping a respectable distance.  They notice her and rise as
she dismounts.

One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few
feet away.

In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and
knocked his nose into his face.  He crumples to the sand.

The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances,
and charge her at once.

In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or
dragging their fallen comrades back.

Lo calls out and stops the fight.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttShe's mine.

<b>EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
Lo and Jen ride, if not side-by-side, then parallel, about
20 feet apart.  Their pace has slowed considerably.  In
fact, they're dead tired.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttLet's stop a moment.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttGive it back!

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttt(shouting a bit)
ttYou're tired.  You need rest.  Your

He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttWell, there used to be!  What's
ttyour name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call
ttme Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall

</b>ttMy comb!

She kicks him.  They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted,
collapses.  She kicks him a few times, then collapses too.

<b>INT. CAVE - DAY

Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of
animal fur.  She sits up with a start and checks her clothes.
Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave.  Next to her
are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp
arrows.  She quickly grabs one of the arrows.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttIf you like that arrow, I can make
ttyou a bow.  Great for hunting wild
ttchicken.  They're delicious.

Jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but
her legs betray her and she falls.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttYou need to eat, understand?  Then
ttyou'll have the strength to fight.
ttUnderstand?

He helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac.
He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts
grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she
starts to wolf it down.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttYou're eating too fast.  Slowly.

<b>EXT. CAVE - DAY
</b>
Lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape.  A chicken
roasts over a fire.  Lo whistles.

Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head.
Lo passes out as Jen scurries away.

<b>EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE AND DESERT - DAY
</b>
Jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony
terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered.
But soon she passes out.

<b>INT. CAVE - NIGHT
</b>
Jen again awakes inside the cave.  Lo tries to feed her some
water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to
find that her legs and hands are tied up.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttYou've got quite a temper.  It's
ttbetter this way.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou coward!

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttStill in a bad mood?  At least
ttyou're speaking.  What's your name?

Jen spits at Lo.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttI didn't think the Hans had names
ttlike that.

Later: She weaves in and out of consciousness.  In the
flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows.

Later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift
bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub.

He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and
dishevelled body.  He comes over and unties her.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttRelax.  If I had wanted to, I would
ttalready have done it.  You must be
ttdying for a bath.  Fresh water's
tthard to get here.  But I managed to
ttbring some up.  You can wear my
ttclothes when you're done.  They're
ttclean.  Don't worry.  I'll sing, so
ttyou'll know where I am.  After the
ttbath, you'll be calmer.

Jen nods and the bandit releases her.  He starts to sing as
he walks out.  Jen waits until the sound recedes before
closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit.
While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud
rendition of a tribal song.  Lo apparently doesn't remember
all the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few
passages.  Jen smiles.

<b>INT. CAVE - NIGHT
</b>
Jen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles
from the soles of her feet.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttNo more hitting on the head!  All
ttthis trouble for a comb?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttIt's mine.  It means a lot to me.
ttA barbarian like you wouldn't
ttunderstand.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttNot true.  I can use it to pick
ttfleas from my horse.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttBy the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttI'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I
ttthough you were a Han.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttGive me back my comb.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttI don't take orders from anyone.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttGive it back.

Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo, drawing a
little blood from his chest.  Furious, Lo lunges at her and
they tussle briefly.  Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and
the scuffling becomes more like foreplay.  Violence turns
into unleashed passion.

<b>EXT. DESERT OASIS - DAY
</b>
Lo and Jen ride across the desert.  Jen holds tightly to him.

<b>EXT. CAVE - NIGHT
</b>
Lo and Jen lie in the bath together.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttWhen I was a boy, one night, I saw
tta thousand shooting stars.  I
ttthought, where did they all go?
ttI'm an orphan.  I used to look for
ttstars alone.  I thought if I rode
ttto the other end of the desert, I'd
ttfind them.  I've been riding in the
ttdesert ever since.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttAnd so, the little boy became a
ttfearsome bandit.  He couldn't find
ttthe stars, so he stole my comb.

Lo pauses.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttOut here, you always fight for
ttsurvival.  You have to be part of a
ttgang to stand a chance.  Slowly,
ttyour gang becomes your family.  All
ttthat Dark Cloud stuff is just to
ttscare people and make my life easier.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttSo you're still that little boy
ttlooking for shooting stars.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttI am a man.  And now I've found the
ttbrightest star of all.

<b>EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
Lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttYour father's men are looking for
ttyou.

Jen doesn't respond.

<b>EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass.

<b>EXT. CLIFF - DAY
</b>
Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff.  Lo looks over,
viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him.  They see
a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttYour father's men are still looking
ttfor you.  They're still out there,
ttcircling closer.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttLet them look.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttIt is trouble for me.

Jen bites her lip.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttDon't send me back!

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttYou must decide.  You might get
tttired of this life.  You might
ttbegin to miss your family.  If it
ttwere our daughter, we'd look for
tther too.  She would miss us.  Jen...
ttI want you to be mine forever.  I
ttwill make my mark on the world.  I
ttwill earn your parents' respect.
ttWe have a legend.  Anyone who dares
ttto jump from the mountain, God will
ttgrant his wish.  Long ago, a young
ttman's parents were ill, so he
ttjumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't
tteven hurt.  He floated away, far
ttaway, never to return.  He knew his
ttwish had come true.  If you believe,
ttit will happen.  The elders say, "A
ttfaithful heart makes wishes come
tttrue."

<b>INT. TENT - DAY
</b>
Jen and Lo kiss.  Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair
and presses it into his palm.  Jen starts to cry.  They
embrace.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttKeep it safe.  Return it to me when
ttwe are together again.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttI will.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttt(smiling painfully)
ttIf you don't, I'll come after you.
ttAnd I won't let you off so easy.

<b>EXT. TENT - DAY
</b>
Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning
light.

End of flashback.

<b>INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
<b>ttttLO
</b>ttWherever I went, someone always
ttrecognized me.  I really tried.
ttLater, I heard you came to Peking.
ttI was afraid I'd never see you
ttagain.  So I came.  I can't let you
ttmarry.

Jen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from
outside the door.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttGo.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttJen...

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttt(through her tears)
ttDon't ever come back.

Lo hovers at the window frame.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttSo it's over?

Jen pauses.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYes.

Lo thrusts a small object in her hand.

He lifts his legs through the window, and drops out of
sight, just as Jen's door is opened from the hall.

<b>ttttMAID
</b>ttWe heard noises.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttIt was just a cat.

The maid pauses, then dutifully exits, closing the door.

Jen opens up her palm; gasping, she sees the comb that Lo
has given her.

<b>EXT. WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY
</b>
The noise and color of a wedding procession.  A marching
band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to
get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a
handsome white horse.

<b>INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY
</b>
Jen's head is completely covered in red cloth, as she rides
silently in the bride's carriage.

<b>EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY
</b>
Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city
gate.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou think Jade Fox will show up?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttShe's out there, but I doubt she'll
ttshow herself.  We'll keep our eyes
ttopen.  Sooner or later, she'll come
ttfor the girl.

<b>INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY
</b>
A small arrow flies into the carriage.  Jen calmly lifts the
red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the
panelling inside the carriage.

We hear Lo's voice from outside the carriage, but Jen
doesn't seem to notice.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttt(v.o.)
ttJen!  Come with me!  You're mine!

Lo runs wildly into the crowd.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttCome with me to the desert!  Jen!
ttCome with me to Xin Jiang!

The guards surround Lo, but he escapes.

<b>EXT. BEIJING STREET - DAY
</b>
Lo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers
pressed against Lo's neck.  Yu comes running around the
corner and sees them.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttWhere is Jade Fox?

Yu jumps in and pushes Li away.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttt(to Lo)
ttCome with me!  Hurry!

<b>INT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY
</b>
Lo sits dejectedly, having told his story to Yu and Li, who
look him over.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttt(to Lo)
ttYou thought she'd give it all up
ttand go back West with you?

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttShe's mine.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttEither way, you are no good to her
ttdead.  With the Gou and Yu clans
tthunting you, you'll soon be in
tttheir hands.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttI don't care anymore.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttIf you truly loved her, you wouldn't
ttsay that.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttDon't you want to see her again.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttAll right.  I'll write you an
ttintroduction.  Take it to Wudan.
ttWait there for news from me.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttAll right.

<b>EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the
compound, a sense of panic in the air.  Yu gives Li a look.
Li shrugs.

<b>INT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT
</b>
A crowd, including Li and Yu, stand by as Te opens the empty
sword case, his voice rising.

<b>ttttSIR TE
</b>ttWhen will this end?  They take it,
ttthey put it back, they take it
ttagain.  My home is turning into a
ttwarehouse.

Bo bursts into the hall, bows to Te.

<b>ttttTE
</b>ttSpeak!

<b>ttttBO
</b>ttJen has run away!  Gou found the
ttwedding chamber empty.  Governor Yu
ttrequests your assistance.  You know
ttthe Giang Hu underworld.  He wants
ttto find her, and keep her from harm.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttSir Te, leave this to us.  Don't
ttworry.

<b>INT. TEA STALL - DAY
</b>
Jen arrives at the tea stall.  She places her sword on the
table, which catches the attention of a couple of Giang Hu
martial arts characters sitting nearby.

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>ttWhat can I serve you?

As the waitress turns to leave, Jen grabs her by the arm.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttThe cup is dirty.

The flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away.
The men approach Jen.

<b>ttttGANGSTER A
</b>ttHello.  What is your name?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttt(without lifting her eyes)
ttLong.

<b>ttttGANGSTER B
</b>ttIt's young Master Long.  My
ttapologies.  I'm Iron Eagle Sung and
ttthis is my brother in arms, Flying
ttCougar Li Yun.  What brings you to
ttHuai An, and where are you headed,
ttMaster Long?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttAnywhere there's action.

The two men exchange glances.

<b>ttttGANGSTER A
</b>ttIn that case, perhaps we could be
ttof assistance.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttDon't bother.

<b>ttttGANGSTER A
</b>ttYou don't seem to understand.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttSo what if I don't?

<b>ttttGANGSTER B
</b>ttWe have ways of helping you
ttunderstand.

The two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped
into scraps by Jen.

<b>ttttGANGSTER A
</b>ttt(stunned)
ttAre you related to Li Mu Bai?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttHe is my defeated foe!

<b>EXT. WOODS - DAY
</b>
Li and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the
horses in the background.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttHave some tea.

As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch.
Embarrassed, Li pulls back.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttShu Lien... The things we touch
tthave no permanence.  My master
ttwould say... there is nothing we
ttcan hold on to in this world.  Only
ttby letting go can we truly possess
ttwhat is real.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttNot everything is an illusion.  My
tthand... wasn't that real?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttYour hand, rough and callused from
ttmachete practice... All this time,
ttI've never had the courage to touch
ttit.

Li takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttGiang Hu is a world of tigers and
ttdragons, full of corruption... I
tttried sincerely to give it up but I
tthave brought us only trouble.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttTo repress one's feelings only
ttmakes them stronger.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttYou're right, but I don't know what
ttto do.  I want to be with you...
ttjust like this.  It gives me a
ttsense of peace.

Li Mu Bai smiles.

<b>INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
Jen walks upstairs.  A waiter greets her.

<b>ttttWAITER
</b>ttPlease follow me.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI want a clean room.

<b>ttttWAITER
</b>ttWe have plenty.  Your order?

Jen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttSteamed whole cod, bite-size
ttmeatballs, a little starchy, but
ttkeep the sauce light, shark fin
ttsoup, mixed vegetables, and some
ttwarm wine.

<b>ttttWAITER
</b>ttt(dazed)
ttI have to order from a bigger
ttrestaurant.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttHurry then.

The waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to
place the orders.  Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not
much money left.

A large group of Giang Hu characters enters.  They survey
the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs.

<b>ttttGIANG HU A
</b>ttThat's him.

<b>ttttMI BIAO
</b>ttI am Iron Arm Mi.  I heard a true
ttmaster has arrived.  I have come to
ttseek a lesson.

Jen ignores him.

<b>ttttMI BIAO
</b>ttt(bristles)
ttYou asked for it!

Mi charges and attacks Jen, who is still sitting sipping tea.
Jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of Mi with a poke at
a sensitive pressure point.  This provokes a reaction from
the other men.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttWhat kind of Iron Arm are you?

<b>ttttFLYING MACHETE CHANG
</b>ttYou have amazing technique!  I am
ttFlying Machete.  Are you related to
ttSouthern Crane?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttSouthern Duck?  I don't eat anything
ttwith two feet.  Who could remember
ttsuch long-winded names?

<b>ttttGOU JUN SIHUNG
</b>ttLi Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and
ttyou don't know his master, Southern
ttCrane?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttWho are you?

<b>ttttGOU JUN SIHUNG
</b>ttI'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttt(furious)
ttGou?  I hate that name.  It makes
ttme puke!  Too bad you're named Gou.
ttYou'll be the first to feel my
ttsword today.

Jen leaps up and dives into battle.  The men all use
different kinds of weapons, but they all succumb to the
powerful Green Destiny.

<b>ttttMONK JING
</b>ttHold it!  Don't you know Monk Jing?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttA monk, in a place like this?  You
ttneed a lesson!

<b>ttttMONK JING
</b>ttWho are you?

She smiles, and leaps again into action after unsheathing
the Green Destiny.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttWho am I?  I am... I am the
ttInvincible Sword Goddess.  Armed
ttwith the Incredible... Green
ttDestiny.  Be you Li or Southern
ttCrane... lower your head... and ask
ttfor mercy.  I am the desert dragon.
ttI leave no trace.  Today I fly over
ttEu-Mei.  Tomorrow... I'll kick over
ttWudan Mountain!

Jen is in a frenzy, slashing and maiming as she speaks.

<b>INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
Yu and Li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who
battled with Jen.

<b>ttttFLYING MACHETE CHANG
</b>ttWe politely asked for a friendly
ttmatch, but she showed no respect,
ttand attacked us.  Everyone came by
ttto teach her a lesson.

<b>ttttMI BIAO
</b>ttHer sword was just too powerful.

<b>ttttMONK JING
</b>ttI've traveled everywhere, but never
ttmet anyone so uncivilized.

<b>ttttSHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD
</b>ttt(heavily bandaged)
ttShe kept accusing me of being Gou
ttJun Pei's brother.  Who is this
ttGou, anyway?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttHer husband.

The men all nod their heads.

<b>EXT. OUTSIDE HWAI AN - DAY
</b>
Li and Yu ride together.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttt(to Yu)
ttWe're close to your headquarters.
ttGo home and check in.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWhat about you?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI'll look around and catch up later.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttNot a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get
tta good night's sleep at headquarters.

Yu takes a fork off the road.  Thunder can be heard in the
darkening sky.

<b>EXT. SUN COMPOUND - DAY
</b>
A group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front
yard of Sun Security.  They stop when Yu enters.

<b>ttttSECURITY MAN A
</b>ttMistress, you're back.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttIt's you!  How's everything here?

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttFine.  You've been gone a while.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYes, and I leave again tomorrow.
ttYour wife was due?

<b>ttttAH WAI
</b>ttYeah, a baby girl.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttGood!

<b>ttttAH WAI
</b>ttI'll be happy if she's half as
ttstrong as you.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttMrs. Wu...

<b>ttttAUNT WU
</b>ttYou're back!

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttHow's the arm?  Still sore?

<b>ttttAUNT WU
</b>ttMuch better.  You've been gone so
ttlong.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttLi Mu Bai is coming to stay the
ttnight.

<b>ttttAUNT WU
</b>ttt(excited)
ttI'll go and make up his room!

Aunt Wu hustles out.  Yu goes into her own room.

<b>INT. HALL OF ANCESTRAL WORSHIP
</b>
Yu lights incense for her former fiancxe9 Meng.  Hearing
something, she turns to see a dishevelled Jen standing
outside downstairs.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttSister Shu Lien...

<b>INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
Yu eases her guard, then opens a drawer, and takes out some
clothes.  Jen, wearing just white underclothing, sets
herself on the edge of Yu's bed.  Yu brings over the clothes.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttHere you must be in proper attire.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI'm just borrowing some clean
ttclothes.  I'm not staying.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI'll give them to you.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttI was just passing by and wondered
tthow you were.

Jen tries to hide her anxiety but finally breaks down on
Yu's shoulder in tears.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou, sister...

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttLook at the trouble you've caused.
ttNow you know what Giang Hu life is
ttreally like.  If you think of me as
ttyour sister, let me give you some
ttsisterly advice.  You can run from
ttmarriage, but not your parents.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttThey forced me to marry!

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttGo back to them first.  Then you
ttcan decide about Lo.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou know about Lo?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttHe really loves you.  Come back to
ttPeking with me.  We'll find a
ttsolution.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttWhere is he now?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttLi Mu Bai has made arrangements.
ttHe sent him to Wudan Mountain.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttYou're working together to set me
ttup!  I'm leaving!

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttHow dare you accuse us?  I always
ttknew you had stolen the sword!
ttI've done nothing but protect you
ttand your family.  And you're repaid
ttme with nothing but contempt.  Li
ttMu Bai himself spared you, and all
ttyou do is insult him.  We wanted
ttsome peace and you've ruined it all!
ttYou're no sister of mine!

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttWhat do I care?  You were never a
ttreal friend anyway.  But I wonder,
tthow long could you last as my enemy?

Jen gets up to leave.  Yu intercepts her.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttPut the sword down!

Jen jumps out.

<b>INT. YUAN COURTYARD - DAY
</b>
Jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are
still practicing.

They raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttt(calling out)
ttJen!

Jen greets Yu with the Green Destiny.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttEveryone out.  Shut the doors.

The men leave.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttFine... the friendship is over.

Yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and
begins her battle with Jen.

Yu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none
are any match for the Green Destiny.

After slicing through another set of Yu's weapons, Jen looks
admiringly at the Green Destiny in her hands.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttDon't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's
ttsword.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttCome and get it if you can.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWithout the Green Destiny, you are
ttnothing.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttDon't be a sore loser.  Go ahead.
ttTake your pick.  I'll wait.  Go
ttahead.

Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks.  Just as the
Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade
at Jen's neck.  She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls
back.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttGive me the sword.

Jen, taking advantage of Yu's trust, slices her arm.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttTake it!

Yu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as Li Mu Bai jumps in.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttt(enraged)
ttStop it!  You don't deserve the
ttGreen Destiny.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttNot another lecture!  On guard!

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttLet's end this here.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttOnly the sword will settle this.

Jen soars up to the rooftop, with Li right on her tail.

<b>EXT. LAKE - DAY
</b>
Jen floats over the lake, Li close behind.

<b>EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - DAY
</b>
Jen runs into a sea of bamboo.  She appears to have lost Li
but is not slowing down.  Her white clothes are now stained
with blood and mud.  The wind had picked up and every breeze
sounds like an air attack by Li.

The two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin
their dances and dodges.  They glance off bamboos and each
other while staying afloat.  Finally Jen lands on the same
stick of bamboo as Li.  The two hold their positions for a
while, as the bamboo bends.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI only let you go because I wanted
ttto see the real you.

Jen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttWhat do you know about a true heart?

Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree.  The bamboo
straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground.  Jen
quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li.

Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo
forest.

<b>EXT. RIVER - DAY
</b>
Jen finally catches up to Li, who is standing on a rock
about a few feet wide amid the rapids.  Jen vaults onto the
rock and scuffles with Li.  Jen loses her balance.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttWhat do you want?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttWhat I've always wanted, to teach
ttyou.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttAll right.  If you can take back
ttthe sword in three moves, I'll go
ttwith you.

Li takes the sword back.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttGive it back!

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttKneel!

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttNever!

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttThen you have no use for the sword.

Li throws the sword into the rapids.

Jen dives in to retrieve it.  He follows Jen downstream by
hopping from one rock to another.  Jen recovers the sword
but is herself drowning.  Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the
rapids and fishes Jen out.  Jade Fox carries the unconscious
Jen away.  Li gives chase, but loses them.

<b>INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
</b>
It's raining.  Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine
paste and then dips a needle in the paste.  She burns the
needle point, causing a blue smoke.  She lights some incense
and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttSooner or later, they'd drag you
ttback to Peking.  Your parents will
ttnever accept you again.  But why go
tthome?  We've gone this far, we
ttwon't stop now.  You'll always be
ttmy lady.  At last, we'll be our own
ttmasters.  We'll be happy.  That's
ttthe most important thing.  All we
tthave left is each other, right?
ttLie down and rest.

Jen is too weak to respond.

Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny.

<b>EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
</b>
Fox scurries ahead in the rain.  Her eyes catch something,
but she keeps moving.

<b>INT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY
</b>
Aunt Wu finishes bandaging Yu.

<b>ttttAUNT WU
</b>ttShe's crazy.  You should have
ttkilled her.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttI didn't have the heart.

<b>ttttAUNT WU
</b>ttWell, Li Mu Bai can do it.

Yu senses movement at the window.  Looking out, she sees
Jade Fox in the distance.

<b>INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
</b>
Jen wakes up, flushed from fever.  She takes a sip from a
cup of water -- it's empty.  She tosses the cup, gets up,
and walks into the rain.

<b>EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
</b>
Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the
raindrops.  Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li
standing there.  Jen limps towards him while mumbling.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttIs it me or the sword you want?

Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttYou've been drugged!

Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner.

<b>INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
</b>
Li lays his hands on Jen's back; she slowly comes to.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttWhere is Jade Fox?

Jen gestures that she doesn't know.  Yu and Bo enter.  Yu
looks at Jen.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWhat happened?

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttJade Fox drugged her.  How did you
ttget here?

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttWe followed Jade Fox.

Instantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's
direction.  Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all,
sending them flinging hither and thither.

Fox shows herself.  Li attacks her.  She falls back, bleeding
to death.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttAnd so you die.

Li touches his neck.

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttAnd so shall you!

Li pulls a single needle from his neck.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttA poisoned needle!

<b>ttttFOX
</b>ttYou deserve to die, but the life I
ttwas hoping to take... was Jen's.
ttTen years I devoted to you.  But
ttyou deceived me!  You hid the
ttmanual's true meaning.  I never
ttimproved... but your progress was
ttlimitless!  You know what poison is?
ttAn eight-year-old girl, full of
ttdeceit.  That's poison!  Jen!  My
ttonly family... my only enemy...

Jade Fox dies.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttYou can't die!  Tell us what poison
ttyou used!  You can't die!  Tell us
ttthe antidote!  You can't let Li Mu
ttBai die!

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttShe used Purple Yin... Purple Yin
ttpoison.  It goes straight to the
ttheart.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttMy blood will soon reverse its flow.
ttIt's the same poison she used to
ttkill my master.  There is no
ttantidote.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttThat can't be!  Everything has an
ttantithesis!  Why not this?

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttThe antidote exists.  She taught it
ttto me.  The formula is simple, but
ttit takes time to prepare.  Trust me.
ttAs you have helped me, let me help
ttyou.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttAll right.  Hurry.  I will hold on
ttas long as I can.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttt(takes the comb from
ttther hair)
ttTake my horse and go to the compound.
ttGive this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help
ttyou.  Hurry!

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttSpare your energy.  I'll be back!

<b>EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
Bo is burying Fox in the rain.

<b>EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
The guards surround Jen.  She pushes past them.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttWhere is Mrs. Wu?

Aunt Wu comes running out.

<b>ttttAUNT WU
</b>ttStop it!

Jen pulls out Yu's comb.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttShu Lien told me to show you this.

<b>ttttAUNT WU
</b>ttLet her in.

<b>INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
Yu sits across from Li, whose pose is almost meditational,
eerily calm.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttMu Bai, hold on.  Give me some
tthope...

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttShu Lien...

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttSave your strength.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttMy life is departing.  I've only
ttone breath left.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttUse it to meditate.  Free yourself
ttfrom this world as you have been
tttaught.  Let your soul rise to
tteternity with your last breath.  Do
ttnot waste it... for me.

<b>ttttLI
</b>ttI've already wasted my whole life.
ttI want to tell you with my last
ttbreath... I have always loved you.
ttI would rather be a ghost, drifting
ttby your side... as a condemned
ttsoul... than enter heaven without
ttyou.  Because of your love... I
ttwill never be a lonely spirit.

Yu cries.

She kisses him lightly.  He closes his eyes.

<b>EXT. PATH - DAY
</b>
As the sun rises, Jen rides speedily, clutching the medicine
in her hands.

<b>INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
</b>
Li is in Yu's arms.  They're holding hands.  The sun shines
in.  Yu slowly releases Li's stiff fingers -- he is dead.

Jen is at the door.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttHe's gone?

Bo peeks over Jen's shoulder.

Yu rises and picks up Green Destiny.  Jen kneels.  Yu raises
the sword, but doesn't kill her.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttBo... please take this sword back
ttto Sir Te.

He takes the sword from her.

<b>ttttYU
</b>ttt(to Jen)
ttNow you must go to Wudan Mountain.
ttLo awaits you there.  Promise me
ttone thing, whatever path you take
ttin this life... be true to yourself.

<b>EXT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
Jen climbs up toward the temple, finally reaching the temple
gate, and sees Lo standing there.

He runs to her.  She greets him.

<b>INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - MAGIC
</b>
Jen and Lo make love.

<b>INT. WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
Lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him,
Jen gone.

<b>EXT. WU TAN MOUNTAIN - DAY
</b>
Lo catches up to Jen, who stands on a bridge.  The gorges
below are shrouded in clouds.  She looks back at him.

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttDo you remember the legend of the
ttyoung man?

<b>ttttLO
</b>tt"A faithful heart makes wishes come
tttrue."

<b>ttttJEN
</b>ttMake a wish, Lo.

Lo pauses.

<b>ttttLO
</b>ttt(closing his eyes)
ttTo be back in the desert, together
ttagain.

Jen smiles, turns, and leaps into the clouds.  They seem to
catch her gently, before she disappears into them.

Lo remains standing, a smile on his face, tears rolling down
his cheeks.
