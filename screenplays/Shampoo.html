tDARK SCREEN - NOVEMBER 4th, 1968
<b>t
</b>tA darkness where even outlines are not discernible. There is
ta dim point of light coming from a dot on the HI-FI which is
tPLAYING the BEACH BOYS: "When we could say good night and
tstill stay together... wouldn't it be niiiice?... we could be
tmarried, then we could be happy, wouldn't it be niiiiice?"
<b>t
</b>tThrough it there has been the SOUND of BANGING, distinct and
trhythmic. It GROWS LOUDER as the MUSIC ENDS. There are also
tWHIMPERING SOUNDS from a woman.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     Oh, no.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     ... what?...
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     That headboard.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Nobody can hear it.
<b>t
</b>tIt BANGS a couple of more times.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     I can. It makes me nervous.
<b>t
</b>tIt continues to bang until Felicia screams, over the banging
tof the headboard. She follows the scream with a few yelps.
tSilence. Now the SOUND of the PHONE RINGING.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>t          (complimentary)
t     Oh my God... Jesus... Jesus
t     Christ... Jesus H. Christ.
<b>t
</b>tThe PHONE CONTINUES TO RING.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>t          (a slightly different
t          tone)
t     You going to answer it?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t          (meaning no)
t     Uh-uh.
<b>t
</b>tIt CONTINUES TO RING.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t          (being for her very
t          mischievous)
t     Want me to?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Let it ring.
<b>t
</b>tAnd it does. It CONTINUES TO RING, killing all other
tconsiderations.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     Boy, whoever she is, she doesn't
t     give up.
<b>t
</b>tAfter a moment's fumbling, George finally picks it up.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Hello...
t          (a little surprised)
t     Ah, hi.
<b>t
</b>tThe GIRL'S VOICE on the other end of the phone can be HEARD
tonly FITFULLY, when George holds the receiver loosely by his
tear. It is TINA.
<b>t
</b><b>t               TINA'S VOICE
</b>t     What took you so long?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Wasn't sure it was you.
<b>t
</b><b>t               TINA'S VOICE
</b>t          (muffled)
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     I... uh... I... uh... can't.
<b>t
</b><b>t               TINA'S VOICE
</b>t          (laughter, sizing it up
t          immediately)
t     All right, who're you with? Jill?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     No.
<b>t
</b><b>t               TINA'S VOICE
</b>t          (lively but muffled)
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     No.
<b>t
</b><b>t               TINA'S VOICE
</b>t          (she's heard Felicia)
t     Awww --
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     I'll call you back.
<b>t
</b><b>t               TINA'S VOICE
</b>t     Come on by.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     I'll call you back...
<b>t
</b><b>t               TINA'S VOICE
</b>t          (raucous laughter,
t          muffled)
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t          (to Tina)
t     Okay, okay...
<b>t
</b>tHe hangs up. Felicia has fished for a cigarette, lit it and
tcoughed.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     You're rude. I mean, you're very
t     rude.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Hey, I tried to get her off the
t     phone.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     You know what I'm talking about.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     No, baby. Now look, that girl that
t     called -- I have to talk to her,
t     she'll do something.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     Like what?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     I don't know, kill herself. She's
t     O.D.'d four times.
<b>t
</b>tThis calms Felicia. A pause.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     Well, is she your girlfriend?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     No.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     Are you in love with her?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Her?
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     Are you?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     No.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     Then it's not your problem.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     It isn't?
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     No. You know too many sick ladies.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     I guess so.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     How do you expect to get anything
t     done if you allow yourself to get
t     sidetracked? Particularly in your
t     business... you deal with women
t     every day...
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     I guess so.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     Don't worry, honey, I'll protect
t     you.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Okay.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>t     God, I adore you.
<b>t
</b>tShe starts to kiss him, the SHEETS are RUSTLING. The PHONE
<b>tRINGS.
</b><b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>t     Shit.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Hello.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL'S VOICE
</b>t     You're home.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Yeah.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL'S VOICE
</b>t     I'm coming over.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     I'll call you back.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL'S VOICE
</b>t          (firm but frightened)
t     No you won't.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     What do you mean?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL'S VOICE
</b>t     I told you I get 'scared up here,
t     so if you're not coming right
t     now...
t          (muffled)
t     I'm not kidding.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Okay.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL'S VOICE
</b>t          (muffled)
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>t     Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge flips on the light.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     Whoever she is, she doesn't give
t     up, does she?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     No.
<b>t
</b>tBare-assed, George swings out of bed, looking for something.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     What're you looking for?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     My keys.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     I thought you said you weren't
t     going anywhere.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this
t     friend of mine for a few minutes.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     You mean that girl, don't you?
<b>t
</b>tGeorge finds his keys and has begun throwing on his clothes,
ta pair of crumpled levis, and a brightly-colored shirt. He
tleaves his shorts and socks on the floor. He's obviously in a
thurry.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What girl, she's not a girl, she's
t     just a friend of mine.
<b>t
</b>tFelicia gives him a long hard look as he dresses.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     You son of a bitch.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge sighs, shrugs, and heads toward the door.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>t     Wait, at least wait 'til I'm
t     dressed. I'm going.
<b>t
</b>tShe starts to get out of bed.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>t     Oh, Christ -- do you have any
t     Kleenex?
<b>t
</b>tGeorge is a little desperate now. He runs to the bathroom,
ttosses her the whole box.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>t     Thanks a lot.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (desperate)
t     Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     Why not?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I'll be right back, it's just that
t     this girl is a different girl...
t     she has attacks.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     What?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     These attacks... it's got something
t     to do with her... uh... pancreas.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge is trying to remember the rest.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>t     She's got a...
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t          (suddenly interested)
t     Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (anxious to go now)
t     Yeah, I think so.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     That's very serious. Who's her
t     doctor?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I don't know.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     Gee, that's very serious...
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I know.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic
t     ulcer.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     She did?
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     It turned out to be cancer.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Wow.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     So what are you doing going over
t     there? You're not her doctor.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I've gotta give her some pills.
t     Percodan, she ran out.
<b>t
</b>tBefore Felicia can say anymore, George goes to the bathroom
tand grabs the first pill jar he can find, moves to Felicia
tand kisses her.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>t     And listen, I'll be right back and
t     I want your ass in that bed when I
t     get back.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t          (acquiescing)
t     You're very rude... if you don't
t     come back --
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I'll be back in a while.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     I don't want to see you anymore.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I'll be right back, baby, really.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tGeorge on his bike threads through traffic on the Strip. OVER
tthis, we HEAR A FEW BARS of THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS "Monday,
tMonday." He pulls up to a signal beside a faded Eugene
tMcCarthy billboard. Somebody HONKS.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GIRL'S VOICE
</b>t     George!
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Hey, baby, what's happening!
<b>t
</b><b>t               GIRL
</b>t          (not bad)
t     Nothing, my sister's back from
t     Vegas.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     That's too bad.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GIRL
</b>t     I have to see you.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Hey, stop by the shop.
<b>t
</b>tHe takes off. Winds through alleys and heads up the hill to
tJill's. It's a shortcut whose precision should make it
tobvious he's traveled it a number of times.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. AT JILL'S - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tGeorge jumps off his bike and pounds on the door.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL'S VOICE
</b>t          (soft)
t     Who is it?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (furious)
t     Who do you think it is?
<b>t
</b>tJILL opens the door. She's shaking.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     There were some shots.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What're you talking about?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (looking around)
t     Where?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     Here in the canyon.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Well, it's a big canyon.
t          (seeing she's upset)
t     Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get
t     back... just for a minute.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     Let me come, too.
t          (pleading)
t     Please don't leave me alone.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What's gonna happen?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t          (near tears)
t     I don't know... every once in a
t     while I just get the feeling
t     something awful's going to happen.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Well, like what?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     I don't know... just... somebody's
t     going to get me.
<b>t
</b>tJill starts to cry. She ambles into the carport in her
tnightgown.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL (CONT'D)
</b>t     I've had these dumb dreams lately.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     They're dumb, somebody... I don't
t     know...
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (suspicious)
t     Who?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     I just... who what?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     You said somebody... who?
<b>t
</b>tShe's not answering.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     I don't know. I can't remember. It
t     was just in my dream.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     No shit?
<b>t
</b>tJill laughs. George comes over to her.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>t     Nobody's gonna get you. Now get
t     inside.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t          (uncertain)
t     George, I don't --
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     You'll do what I tell you. Now get
t     the fuck inside.
<b>t
</b>tShe backs inside. He moves in after her.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     George --
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (moving after her)
t     Keep moving --
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     Now, George --
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Nobody's gonna get you but me!
<b>t
</b>tHe leaps after her and she screams, delighted. George chases
ther into the bedroom. Jill screams. He throws her on the bed
tand leaps on top of her, kissing her. She likes it.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>t     How are you, baby?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     Fine. How are you?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic.
t     Incredible. Incredible, really
t     incredible.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     What?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm
t     gonna open the shop. I'm getting it
t     together.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     How?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (rising)
t     Right now -- I'm at the epitome of
t     my life.
t     Right now I feel so good I'm afraid
t     something's gonna happen.
<b>t
</b>tHe gets off the bed. Jill is fascinated.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>t     When I was a little kid, I used to
t     want to go to Europe but right now

t     Europe.

</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (taking her to his
t          cubicle)
t     I gotta talk to you.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     I don't want to talk about it...
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     But you don't know what happened.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     I don't care.
<b>t
</b><b>t               TINA
</b>t     George, do you think there's too
t     much height?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (seating her)
t     It's great. You don't know what
t     happened, this girl she almost got--
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t          (a little hysterical)
t     I don't care about that girl, I
t     don't care if she's dead.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Calm down, baby.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t          (calming down)
t     I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm
t     simply saying you have no respect
t     for me, that you're incapable of
t     distinguishing between me and one
t     of your average Hollywood...
t     mummers...
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     -- What?
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     Nummers.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What?
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     -- Numbers, and I don't need to
t     place myself in that kind of
t     position.
<b>t
</b>tGLORIA tugs on George's arm.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What're you here for?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GLORIA
</b>t          (as if giving away a

t     -- A wash and set.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     No.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GLORIA

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     You need a cut.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GLORIA
</b>t     But Mr. Norman said --
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Said what!
<b>t
</b><b>t               GLORIA
</b>t          (whispered)
t     I just needed a wash and set, a
t     wash and set, that's all.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Well, baby, I'm George and it needs
t     to be cut.
t          (to Felicia)
t     But I don't want to place you in
t     that position either.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     -- I like myself far too much, far
t     too much.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I don't want to place you in any

<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA

<b>t

<b>t

</b>t          (a schvar)
t     Yeah!
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Wash her.
<b>t
</b><b>t               MARY
</b>t          (looking at Gloria)
t     What with?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (nudging her)
t     -- A brillo pad, I don't care,
t     anything.
<b>t
</b>tMary has gone over to the shampoo stand above which are
tseveral photographs of models and one of a handsome young
tblack Marine in fatigues. George has gone to pick up a razor,
tchanges it.
<b>t
</b><b>t               MARY
</b>t     -- You takin' a lot of shit lately,
t     George.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     -- Oh yeah.
<b>t
</b><b>t               MARY
</b>t          (mixing)
t     But then again you ask for it --
t     you just like my Otis -- can't keep
t     his hands outta ladies' hair
t     either.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge laughs.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t
</b><b>t               MARY

<b>t

t     George --
<b>t

t     I'm coming, baby --

t     How's Otis doing, anyway?
<b>t
</b><b>t               MARY
</b>t     That boy always does great. He's a
t     corporal or a squad leader or
t     something, just wrote me from some
t     place called Kwang Due?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t
</b>tGeorge winks at Mary, heads back.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>t          (going  right on)
t     I'm not used to that kind of

<b>t

</b>t     What kind of treatment?
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been
t     cutting too much hair lately. I'm

<b>t
</b>tJill has entered the shop. She approaches George.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     George.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Great.
<b>t
</b>tJill stands there now, not knowing what to say.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE (CONT'D)

<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b>tGeorge looks away.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Great.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t

<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

t     I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
<b>t

</b>t     Go where?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

t     Egypt!
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

t     get back, okay?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     Okay, but how did it go at the
t     bank?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Great... can we talk later?
<b>t
</b><b>t               NORMAN
</b>t          (the shop's owner)
t     George!
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Yeah.
<b>t
</b><b>t               NORMAN
</b>t     You're late, we're all backed up
t     and you're supposed to go to
t     Buffums.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Buffums?
<b>t
</b><b>t               NORMAN
</b>t     Yes, Buffums.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I've got heads here, Norman.
<b>t
</b><b>t               NORMAN
</b>t     You promised you'd do the show.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Oh fuck, Norman!
<b>t
</b><b>t               NORMAN
</b>t     Don't use that tone of voice with
t     me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge turns back to Felicia as RICCI comes by. He's near
ttears.
<b>t
</b><b>t               RICCI
</b>t     Do you know what that Lillian
t     Bercovici just did?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (working on Felicia)
t     No, man.
<b>t
</b><b>t               RICCI
</b>t     -- Right after I sprayed her?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What?
<b>t
</b><b>t               RICCI
</b>t          (losing control)
t     She touched it! Then she played in
t     it and got it all into something
t     else. Now I don't know what it is!
<b>t
</b>tHe's waiting for George for sympathy. Jill steps away
tgathering patience.
<b>t
</b><b>t               RICCI (CONT'D)
</b>t     I can't even stand to talk to her
t     on the phone.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (sympathetic)
t     She's heavy.
t          (to Felicia)
t     See, Norman expects me to get in
t     here, take care of all the
t     customers and then do his show out
t     in Norwalk. I gotta have my own
t     shop, just out of self defense.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     I can see that.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     You're looking great, baby.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     What're you doing later?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (half kidding)
t     Whatever you say.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     We have this political thing
t     tonight. Could you comb me out at
t     the house?
<b>t
</b>tGeorge is torn.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I don't know. I'm beginning to feel
t     guilty.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     What about?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     All I ever do is play. I should be
t     doing something to get my own shop
t     open.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     Why don't you see Lester?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (a little alarmed)
t     Your husband?
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     Yes.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (not sure what she's
t          driving at)
t     What about?
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     The shop. I think you're a good
t     investment, and I don't mind
t     telling him.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
<b>t
</b>tJill returns.
<b>t

<b>t

</b>t     Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     I already said hello.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     I know but this is important. I
t     have to make a decision.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     About what?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     Whether or not I'm going.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Going where?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     Egypt.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Honey, have they offered you the

<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (to Jill)
t     Just a second, I'll be right with
t     you...
<b>t
</b>tHe turns back to Felicia. Jill moves away.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t          (interested)
t     Is she all right?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I don't know. Just a minute...
<b>t
</b>tGeorge moves over to Jill.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE (CONT'D)

<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Right now?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     Look, either we have a meaningful

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (really harassed)
t     Look, baby, can we talk about it
t     later?
<b>t
</b>tFelicia is watching them.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     When?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     When I get off work.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (half to himself)
t     Neither do I, baby.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t

<b>t
</b>tBack to Felicia. As Jill leaves.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     -- Anyway.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     I hope she's all right.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     She's fine. You really think I'd be
t     a good investment?
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     No, I know.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     And I certainly wouldn't tell
t     Lester.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I know.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t     I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     That's great. You look great, baby,
t     great. Dennis, look at Felicia's
t     hair.
<b>t
</b>tDennis stops. He's with the DESK GIRL. Both of them:

<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. SHOP - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tJill, in street, on verge of tears... moves to her car...
tgets in... sits for a long moment.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tGeorge on bike pulls into office building. The MUSIC OVER is
<b>tJEFFERSON AIRPLANE'S "WHITE RABBIT."
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT. LESTER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tIn his inner office.
<b>t
</b>tLESTER'S on the telephone, staring out the window.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Look, Kurt, I don't care where you
t     have to go. I want Beluga Caviar
t     there. Call Jurgenson's, call
t     Chasen's... I don't care how much
t     it costs... how much?... then spend
t     it. Just make sure it's there.
t     You've got all the money in the

t     Just make sure it's there on the
t     table tonight.
t          (he hangs up)
t     Jesus.
t          (to George, to no one)
t     You've got to do everything
t     yourself. You know?
<b>t
</b>tSuddenly Lester gives George a steely look. It covers his
thair, his clothes. George is acutely uncomfortable.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>t     Felicia says you're a very good

<b>t

<b>t

</b>t     Thank you.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     I didn't say it, she did. How'd you
t     happen to get in that line of work?
<b>t
</b>tGeorge sort of knows what Lester's driving at.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Oh, well, I went to beauty
t     school... you know you go to beauty
t     school... and you get your
t     operator's license... and you
t     graduate... and you're a
t     hairdresser.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     I see.
<b>t
</b>tLong pause. George hasn't told Lester what he wants to know.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>t     It's an unusual trade.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Yes it is.
<b>t
</b>tAn awkward pause.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     But the important thing is you're
t     successful at it.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     In a way. But...
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     But what?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I'm better than the guy I work for.
<b>t
</b>tThis seems to interest Lester.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Well, George, I invest for a lot of
t     people. I make a lot of money for
t     them. More than they could do for
t     themselves.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     After a while that hurts... doesn't
t     it?
<b>t
</b>tLester smiles. He appreciates this.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     It's good you want to do something,
t     George.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Thank you.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     But personal services are not the

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     They're not?
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t          (suddenly direct, almost
t          enthusiastic)
t     No, they're a pain in the ass,
t     there's no way of keeping track of
t     anything. It's a cash business and
t     you've got to watch your operators
t     or they'll steal you blind, am I
t     right or am I right?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     You're right.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Who needs that kind of aggravation?
t     Who needs that kind of aggravation
t     at my age? When I finish work I
t     want to...
<b>t
</b>tThe door bursts open. It's one of the SECRETARIES.
<b>t
</b><b>t               SECRETARY
</b>t     Mr. Karpf...
<b>t

tGeorge.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     I'm sorry but I need an extra
t     garage key.
<b>t
</b>tIn Lester's presence she seems distinctly younger than she
tdid with Jill. She's startled when she sees George.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     What for? What do you need the key
t     for?
<b>t
</b>tJackie continues to stare at George.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     The man from Sloan's is coming. I
t     called you about it.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     How did you lose that key? Oh,
t     George, this is uh Miss -- this is
t     Jackie.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER

<b>t

</b>t          (almost immediately on the
t          defensive)
t     Well, yes, George is a wonderful
t     hairdresser.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Is that right?
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     So how's Norman?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Great. Who's been doing your hair?
<b>t
</b>tJackie glances at Lester.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     I go to the blue'n gold barber shop
t     in Westwood. The guy in the third

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     George is going to open a shop.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE

t     No kidding? Your own shop?
<b>t
</b>tGeorge starts to say yes.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     George, could you -- excuse us for
t     a minute?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Sure.
<b>t
</b>tHe leaves the office, shuts the door, leaving Jackie and
tLester alone. Lester shuts the door.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     I called to tell you I was sending
t     one over but the line was busy,
t     you're always on the phone.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     I am?
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER

<b>t

</b>t     Steve?
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Whatever his name is, that actor.
<b>t
</b>tJackie looks for a moment as if she's going to get very
temotional.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.
t          (a touch bitter)
t     Steve couldn't get arrested as an
t     actor. He couldn't get arrested as
t     a boy.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Then you were talking to him.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     I ran into him at the 76 station on
t     little Santa Monica, what was I
t     supposed to do, hide in the ladies
t     room? Yes, I was talking to him.
<b>t
</b>tLester's a little chagrined now but not much.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>t          (an outburst)
t     I'm always on the phone because you
t     never let me see anybody, I can't
t     even bring my girlfriends over to
t     the house because they might run
t     into you. You're driving me up the
t     wall, Lester. You're even jealous

t     somebody I can talk to.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     I'm not jealous of the dogs.

</b>t          (very positive)
t     Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous

t     get caught... off base.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     So I can't talk to some broken down
t     actor, what do you think, I'm going
t     to tell him I'm screwing Lester
t     Karpf!
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Of course not.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE

<b>t

</b>t          (trying to think of why)
t     It's very logical, it's the most
t     logical thing in the world. You
t     wouldn't feel this confined if we

<b>t

</b>t     Really? How about starting with
t     tonight?
<b>t
</b>tBy her tone, Jackie indicates she's been saying all of this
tfor months. Lester repeating it like it's just occurred to
thim genuinely upsets her. She's near tears and she's not the
tkind of girl who cries easily. Lester's sensitive to it.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Sweetheart, I know it's rough but
t     at this point -- my business

<b>t

t     Look... you do well for people,

<b>t

</b>t     You're lying about one thing,

</b>t          (normal tone now)
t     Well, George, you may not think ten

<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER

<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE

</b>t     Yeah... wow.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge stops and takes off his shirt. He's wearing a purple T
tshirt underneath. He goes back to cutting. Jackie's getting
tmore and more edgy, partly because of George's proximity and
tpartly because of her concern over what he's doing. George on
tthe other hand is now less tentative, more focused on the job
tat hand.
<b>t

</b>t          (finally)

</b>t     Jackie?... Jackie?
<b>t
</b>tLester opens the door. He's hit with a blast of steam and the
tsight of George stripped to the waist, ostensibly working
tover Jackie who is loosely wrapped with a towel. George has a
tcomb in one hand and now turns on the dryer, blowing it with
ta somewhat exaggerated gesture.

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Oh, I'm sorry.
<b>t
</b>tHe shuts the door. Then he thinks better of it. He opens the
tdoor again and takes a step into the bathroom.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge waves the comb at Lester a little impatiently. It's
twet and sprinkles Lester.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Look, either come in or stay out!

</b>t     That's okay, that's okay, just shut
t     the door.
<b>t
</b>tLester shuts the door, feeling a little chagrined, and
trelieved. He sits on the bed and puts the present beside him.
tIn a moment George emerges.

</b>t     Lorna?
<b>t
</b><b>tLORNA'S BEDROOM
</b><b>t
</b>tLorna is sitting on her bed, in her tennis dress but with her

</b>t          (coolly)
t     Hello, George.
<b>t
</b>tThey walk out to the lanai together and George picks up his
tcase. There is considerable tension from Felicia as they walk
tinto her bedroom. Felicia slides the bedroom door shut, an
taction which George unhappily notices. She turns to George.
tShe looks very hostile. She's trembling.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>t     I've missed you.

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I've... missed you too.
<b>t
</b>tFelicia comes to him. She comes to him and touches his arm.
tGeorge suddenly flings his case across the room and pounds
this fist into a high-backed chair, turning away from Felicia.
tShe clearly misunderstands the action.
<b>t
</b><b>t               FELICIA
</b>t          (touched)
t     It's okay, honey... it's okay now.
<b>t
</b>tShe moves to the door and quietly locks it. George winces.
tShe comes back to him and kisses him gently. She kisses him
tagain with more passion. George tries to respond.

</b>t     Comb my hair out later, honey.

twalk does he see Jill. She's been quietly waiting on his
tfront porch, hidden in the shadows of the overhang. She
tdoesn't look happy. George stops cold.

tstraightening the mess.

tentrance.

</b>tThe crowd has thinned out to a trickle, but Pope's red
tPorsche is hemmed in by the fire trucks and a couple of other
tcars.
<b>t
</b>tPope is vainly trying to talk to firemen and policemen to
tmove their trucks and they keep referring him to someone
telse.
<b>t
</b><b>tJILL AND LESTER
</b><b>t
</b>tLester stands, swaying a little unsteadily in the lot. The
tDeputy secret service man seen twice earlier, comes on up to
tLester.
<b>t

</b>t     -- we can't find a thing, Mr.
t     Karpf.

t     it?
<b>t
</b><b>t               DEPUTY
</b>t          (he's serious)
t     It's good if there's no bomb. If

</b>t     That's fine --
<b>t
</b>tLester opens the car door and pulls back the seat. He has a
thell of a time squirming into the back, but tries to be
tlighthearted about it. Jill gets into the front.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>tThe door on the driver's side is still open and Lester's feet
tare poked out it. His head is pushing on the canvas top.
<b>t

</b>t     See, nothin' to it.
<b>t
</b>tJill turns and smiles, but it's a mistake since Lester's
tupper body is almost leaning on her as it is. Lester puts his
thand behind Jill's head, forcing her to hold the position,
talmost nose to nose with Lester.
<b>t

</b>t     Oh, say, how would you kids like to
t     stop off for a drink?
<b>t
</b>tJill and Johnny Pope exchange glances. Jill shrugs to say,
tgee I'm sorry. Pope nods.
<b>t
</b><b>t               POPE
</b>t     Well we'd love to, but we're going

tjostling Lester around as he goes. Lester chuckles.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. FREEFORM SWIMMING POOL - JACKIE AND GEORGE - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tlie side by side on deck chairs at the end of the pool. The
thouse and upper grounds are obscured by neat rows of hedges
tand all sorts of random shrubbery. Jackie and George watch
tthe Twins splash and flounce around in the jacuzzi with a
tcouple of androgenous men. The Twins stand up in the jacuzzi,
tarm in arm and half move, half throw themselves to another
tend of the jacuzzi.
<b>t
</b>tJackie smiles. She stretches, yawns.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t          (lazily)

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Not me, pal.
<b>t
</b>tJackie laughs. The Twins have gotten onto some sort of
tsplashing contest with the boys. Water hits George and
tJackie. They're hit again. They shrug, George rises, takes
tJackie's hand. They walk on around the pool, beside and along
ta maze of hedgerows.

tand the neat hedgerows which wind around the property.
<b>t

</b>t     Whose place is this?
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. SAMMY'S FOYER
</b><b>t
</b>tby the open staircase. Pope is greeting Sammy. Introducing
tJill. Sammy's a tall, Jesus figure with an Indian shirt that
tgoes to the knees on his levi's.
<b>t
</b><b>t               SAMMY
</b>t     Sure I know Jill.
<b>t
</b>tLester is staring in some wonder at the girl who is still
tsitting on the staircase, nursing her baby. She looks up,
tsmiles at Lester, who manages a nod back, doesn't take his
teyes off the sight.
<b>t
</b><b>t               POPE
</b>t          (noticing)
t     -- the bar's in there, Les.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LES
</b>t          (embarrassed)
t     -- oh, fine.
<b>t
</b>tHe strolls off toward the bar which is half visible through
tthe open foyer.
<b>t
</b><b>tAT THE BAR
</b><b>t
</b>twhere Jill and George were earlier. Lester's ordered a drink.
tThe huge black in the Afro offers him a toke. Lester stares
tat it dumbly.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t          (a little lamely,
t          indicating drink)
t     ... I'm...
<b>t
</b>tHe takes his drink and half toasts the black. He stops and
this eyes PAN the room. Lester is virtually the only person on
this feet. Everyone else is either on the floor or on deep
tsofas, side by side, head to feet, barely talking, barely
tmoving. In fact the most mobile thing in the room in smoke
tfrom the joints.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - LESTER
</b><b>t
</b>tLester shakes his head as if to clear it. He takes a drink
tand almost on cue the ACID ROCK MUSIC HITS and the strobe
tlights go on.
<b>t
</b>tLester is momentarily alarmed, as if it had something to do
twith his drink. He manages to stagger out of the strobe light
teffect, hangs onto a railing in the next room.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. KITCHEN - JILL, RED DOG AND POPE
</b><b>t
</b>tJill stands over Red Dog who hasn't moved an inch, his
tmeasuring cup of wine still half filled.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     -- so what's new, Red Dog?
<b>t
</b><b>t               RED DOG
</b>t     Nothing, man. Same old shit. It's
t     the same old shit wherever you go,
t     nothing ever changes.
<b>t
</b>tPope looks up, sees Lester just outside the kitchen door.

</b><b>t               POPE
</b>t     Jill, scraves is a --
<b>t
</b>tHe points toward the kitchen door where Lester looks like
the's about to enter.
<b>t
</b>tPope takes Jill and they move out the back door in the
tdirection of the rear grounds that Jackie and George had
ttaken earlier.
<b>t
</b><b>tLESTER
</b><b>t
</b>tpeers into the kitchen. It's filled mostly with unkempt
tbeards. He decides against it, turns up a small staircase and
tcontinues up it until he finds himself in a den.
<b>t
</b>tSeveral people are seated on the floor, quietly smoking and
twatching television. They seem a shade better dressed than
tthose in the kitchen.
<b>t
</b>tLester squints at the set which is a little blurry and
tpartially blocked, by someone sitting directly in front of
tit. He kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jacket smoking a
tpipe.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t          (whispering)
t     -- how's it going?

</b><b>t               LESTER

</b>t          (taking a good look at
t          Lester, then)
t     No, that's Sally.
<b>t
</b>tLester looks at the screen. Sally, handled by bare arms, is
tbeing placed on a foam rubber cushion. She laughs.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t          (dumbly)
t     -- Sally?
<b>t
</b><b>t               MAN WITH PIPE

t          stem to a girl by
t          Lester's ear, also
t          watching the set)
t     -- Sally.
<b>t
</b>tLester looks at Sally. She looks at Lester, nods. Turns back
tto screen to watch herself. Lester turns from Sally to see a
ttelevision camera and the foam rubber mattress, now
tabandoned. Lester shakes his head.
<b>t
</b><b>tOUTSIDE ON GROUNDS WITH JILL AND JOHNNY POPE
</b><b>t
</b>tThey're walking through shrubbery and hedges that lead them
tto a pair of empty deck chairs by the jacuzzi end of the
tpool. One of the Twins is still in the jacuzzi.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

<b>t
</b><b>t               POPE
</b>t     You mean when are you going to
t     Egypt?
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     Now I didn't mean that, you rat.

</b><b>t               POPE

</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     You're kidding.

</b><b>t               POPE

</b><b>t               POPE
</b>t     -- just before I ask you out? I
t     can't do that. Let's get out of
t     here before good old Les catches up
t     with us again.
<b>t
</b>tThere's a flash of light from the poolhouse window. Jill
tturns toward it, then back to Pope, still making up her mind.
tANGLE SHIFTS SLIGHTLY to HOLD on light from window.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. POOLHOUSE - GEORGE AND JACKIE
</b><b>t
</b>tGeorge has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge. He's
tlooking at Jackie, closes the refrigerator lamely. It opens
tagain and he closes it again.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     What's wrong?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     -- do you want ice?
<b>t
</b>tInterior poolhouse lit now by lights from outside.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     -- no.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge pops the tops of the cans, hands one to Jackie.
tNeither one of them drink. They're staring steadily at each
tother, their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis
tcourt lights which someone has turned on.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (finally)
t     -- we're kidding ourselves.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t          (staring right back)
t     -- we are?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     -- last night I dreamt I was fifty
t     years old and Mary told me I was
t     supposed to meet Jill at the shop.
t     It seared me shitless.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     Why?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I can't imagine being with Jill
t     when she's fifty years old. I can't
t     imagine not being with you.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge moves to her. Jackie is waiting for him. They kiss. It
tis long and lingering and deliberate. George breaks away and
tgoes to the poolhouse door. There's no lock, only an eye
tlatch on the screen door. He latches it, tests it. It gives
tslightly. Nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to
tJackie who stands waiting.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     -- but what about her? I don't want
t     to hurt Jill.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge takes the coke out of her hand. She lets him.
<b>t
</b><b>tLESTER
</b><b>t
</b>twalks back in the foyer, holding a drink, swaying. The strobe
tlights are going again in the living room.
<b>t
</b>tSuddenly he sees a girl, at least half nude, her huge painted
tlavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights. The
tvision disturbs him greatly.
<b>t
</b>tHe carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get
tnear her. She seems to move. He moves after her through the
tlights down the length of the room, going as quickly as
tprudence allows. Finally when they reach the end of the
tliving room she's disappeared. Then he looks out and sees her
tpoised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged
tpath that leads down to the pool.
<b>t
</b>tHe lunges toward the vision, and bounces off a sliding glass
tdoor.
<b>t
</b><b>tJILL AND JOHNNY POPE
</b><b>t
</b>thave made it through the entrance and Pope's Porsche is in
tsight. Jill suddenly stops and looks at Pope.
<b>t
</b><b>t               POPE
</b>t     What's wrong?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     We can't really leave that poor man
t     here alone.
<b>t
</b><b>t               POPE
</b>t     -- he'll never know the difference.
<b>t
</b>tJill is clearly thinking about something else besides Lester.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     -- still -- at least we should tell
t     him we're going. C'mon.
<b>t
</b><b>t               POPE
</b>t          (going along with it,
t          protesting)
t     I'm telling you he won't know the
t     difference.
<b>t
</b><b>tBY THE POOL - LESTER
</b><b>t
</b>tnow with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care
tthat only tightrope walkers and drunks can move: every step
tis a possible disaster.
<b>t
</b><b>t               TWIN
</b>t          (from Jacuzzi)
t     Hey.
<b>t
</b>tLester looks down, sees one of the Twins. Her arm is
toutstretched, her breasts dripping water VISIBLE through the
tshrubbery spotlights. She's holding a joint.
<b>t
</b><b>t               TWIN (CONT'D)
</b>t     -- it's getting soggy.
<b>t
</b>tLester takes it.
<b>t
</b><b>t               THE GUY WITH HER
</b>t     -- just put it on the bench over
t     there and come on in.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     -- in there?
<b>t
</b><b>t               THE GUY
</b>t     Sure.
<b>t
</b>tLester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it
tover to the bench. He puts the joint down.
<b>t
</b>tStares at it. He looks up and there's the other Twin standing
tbeside him, nude, with her breasts visible through the towel
tloosely flung over her shoulders.
<b>t
</b><b>t               TWIN
</b>t          (meaning joint)
t     Could I have that?
<b>t
</b>tLester silently hands it to her. Stares at the pool and the
tother Twin isn't there. He looks back and the one who had
ttaken the joint is gone. He looks back to the pool and the
tother Twin surfaces with the force of Flipper, beside the Guy
tin the pool.
<b>t
</b>tLester stares, then he sighs and pulls off his pants, almost
tfalling down as he does.
<b>t
</b>tCarrying them, he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Say --
<b>t
</b><b>t               THE GUY
</b>t     -- what is it now, man?
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Do you know where I can find a
t     towel?
<b>t
</b><b>t               THE GUY
</b>t     -- the poolhouse.
<b>t
</b>tHolding his trousers, his tux shirt hanging half down over
this boxer shorts, Lester moves on over to the poolhouse. He
ttries the door. The latch creaks. He pulls at it again and
tthe latch pops open. He starts to open the door, then hears
tthe unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense
tlove making. The girl is quite carried away.
<b>t
</b>tLester hesitates. He listens as her sighs, interspersed with
tfetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity. He thinks
tbetter of it. He takes his hand off the door knob and quietly
tcloses the screen door.
<b>t
</b>tHe starts to walk away, then notices the window on the side.
tHe can't resist. He moves to it. He can't see anything. He
tmoves closer. The dim, dark but classical outline of a man
tmounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity
tcan be SEEN. Lester watches. The SOUNDS are not as loud from
tthis angle, but gradually they can be HEARD as the woman's
tcries grow louder. Lester is glued to the window.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL'S VOICE
</b>t     -- there you are. Les. Les -- Les --
t     Les, we're leaving.
<b>t
</b>tThe ANGLE has BROADENED to SHOW Lester holding his pants, not
ttaking his face away from the window. Jill and Johnny Pope
tstand beside him.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Shhh --
t          (with genuine awe)
t     -- now that's what I call fucking.
<b>t
</b>tPope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window.
<b>t
</b>tAs he does, a light begins to flood the room. It is the
trefrigerator door slowly opening, due in part to the rhythmic
timpact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end
ttable to another end table and to the refrigerator.
<b>t
</b>tIt opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of
tGeorge and Jackie.
<b>t
</b><b>tLESTER
</b><b>t
</b>twho has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of
tthe image hits him. His face freezes. It is harsh and
tdetermined. He turns slowly away from the window and walks
tpast Jill without looking at her.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     -- what --
<b>t
</b>tShe turns to the window and sees George and Jackie herself.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL (CONT'D)
</b>t          (watching)
t     Oh my God. Oh no, oh no. Oh no.
<b>t
</b>tShe turns and picks up a wrought iron end table and hurls it
tthrough the window, shattering the glass everywhere.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL (CONT'D)
</b>t          (screaming)

</b>t     Honey? Where've you been? We've
t     been looking everywhere for you.
<b>t
</b>tJackie doesn't move, only stares wide-eyed through the broken
twindow at the screaming Jill.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t          (softly)
t     Oh God.
<b>t
</b>tAn ashtray is hurled into the room, smashing against the
twall, and Jill can be SEEN now storming off with Pope.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge, with one leg in his pants, rushes over to a far
twindow, pulls it open.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Jill! Jill! Jill, goddammit!
<b>t
</b>tHe's got the pants on backwards. He turns back to Jackie who
thas already slipped into her dress, is stuffing pantyhose
tinto a purse.

</b>t     -- Jesus --
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE

tthem.

</b>t     -- shit...
t          (he grabs his shirt)
t     ... wait here, honey --
<b>t
</b>tHe runs out of the door, beside the pool, past the jacuzzi
tand into the maze of hedgerows. The Twins stand motionless
tside by side in the water.

</b>t     Far out.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge, searching wildly through hedgerows, is calling Jill.
tHe can't find her. He finds himself next to a ten foot ivy
tcovered wall. He can't reach the top. He moves along the
twall... arrives at a wrought iron gate. It's locked. He peers
tthrough the gate calling frantically:
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEROGE
</b>t     Jill, honey?
<b>t
</b>tInches from his face on the other side of the gate, the bare
tteeth of a huge German Sheperd GROWL at him viciously. George
tchooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the
thouse.

tpurrs off into the night.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge turns and runs back into the house and through the
tstrobe-lighting living room.
<b>t
</b><b>tAT THE POOLHOUSE
</b><b>t
</b>tGeorge heaving deep breaths now runs on into the poolhouse.
tThe refrigerator door still hangs open. Window glass is
tscattered on the floor, and George steps on it, cutting his
tfoot, hopping a little, pulling out a shard. Jackie's gone.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Jackie?

texpectantly. As it comes by the morning newspaper is tossed
tat his feet.

</b>tHe hangs up. Stares around the room. Jill's apartment is, as
tusual, good-little-girl tidy. (A contrast with Jackie's
tparticularly kitchen.)
<b>t
</b>tGeorge walks over to the window and look's at the city. He
twalks out onto the deck and sits in a deck chair.

</b><b>tGRAY SCREEN
</b><b>t
</b>tThere is the SOUND of a CAR IDLING.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge opens his eyes. Above him is the carport and Jill's
tyellow Mustang has just pulled in. George rises. He walks
tinto the living room as Jill comes down the steps to the
tkitchen, carrying the paper. The kitchen clock reads 4:44.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge glances at it. Then back at Jill. She looks at him,
tfrightened but not moving. Her hair is stringy and she's got
tno makeup on. There's a bruise on the inside of her upper arm
tand a small one on her neck, and one on her left thigh all of
twhich George will note in the course of the scene.
<b>t

ttake off her dress, then changes her mind and puts on a robe
tover it.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE (CONT'D)

t     at least?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL
</b>t     I'd like you to leave now.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge doesn't move. Jill goes over and fishes into a tote
tbag by the wall. She returns with Felicia's missing earring.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL (CONT'D)

t     but if it'll help any, I found it
t     in your bed.

t     of... love... that'll help me...
t     not now, but eventually.
<b>t
</b>tIt's been rising in him the last few exchanges. Now all
tGeorge's restraints seem to leave him. He stops trying to
ttouch her and stands his ground, exploding:
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     You dumb cunt, everybody fucks
t     everybody, grow up, for Christ's
t     sakes. You're an antique, you know

t     'em, all these chicks they're all
t     fucking, they're getting their hair
t     done so they can go and fuck,
t     that's what it's all about. Come
t     into the shop tomorrow and I'll
t     show you -- I fucked her, and her,
t     and her, and her, and her -- I
t     fucked 'em all!... That's what I
t     do, I fuck. That's why I went to
t     beauty school, to fuck. I can't
t     help that, they're there and I do
t     their hair and sometimes I fuck
t     'em. I stick it in and I pull it
t     out and that's a fuck, it's not a
t     crime.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge leans on a glass topped coffee table for support, not
teven bothering to look at Jill. Jill has been pulled together
ta little more by the speech.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JILL

tlike hoods. Lester sits in the chair George sat in the other
tnight. Before him is a bottle of J & B, a paper bucket filled
twith melting ice. The other men rise when George walks into
tthe room.

<b>t

<b>t

<b>t

<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     I wanna know your thinking, I wanna
t     know how someone like you thinks.
t     Did you think you could get away
t     with it, did you think you could
t     put something over on me? Does a
t     guy like you get his kicks sneaking
t     around behind people's backs and
t     taking advantage of them? Maybe
t     that's your idea of being anti

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER

t     You're so beyond my comprehension I

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Then don't... just have 'em beat me
t     up or whatever you're gonna do.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     No, not yet, not yet. You worry

t     worrying all night, now you can
t     worry.
<b>t
</b>tA pause. Lester freshens his drink.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>t     Was it me, did you have something
t     against me?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What, do you think I planned it?
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER

<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t          (agonized)
t     ... how am I gonna tell you what
t     they have against you?
t     I mean Jesus fucking Christ,
t     they're women, aren't they? Have
t     you ever listened to women talk,
t     man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til
t     it's fucking coming out of my ears.
t     I'm on my feet all day, every
t     fucking day, listening to women
t     talk and you know what they talk
t     about, don't you? Being fucked up
t     by some guy. That's all that's on
t     their minds. I'm sure you've done
t     something they could get pissed off
t     about, what's that got to do with
t     it? All women are pissed off, man,
t     all of 'em. They fucking hate us!
t     Don't you know that?
<b>t
</b>tLester has listened to this with some alteration of his
tintensity.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     ... yes, I follow your thinking on
t     that.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     We're always trying to fuck them...
t     they know it and they like it and
t     they don't like it... that's just
t     how it is... look, it's got nothing
t     to do with you, man. It just
t     happened. Felicia's got nothing to
t     do but shop and get her hair done
t     and she knows she's getting
t     older... her daughter hates her,
t     what's she going to do, go to PTA
t     meetings?
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Do you think Lorna hates her? I

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates
t     her.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Well, I don't know.
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>t          (to George)
t     Want a drink?
<b>t

<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Okay, thanks.
<b>t
</b>tLester gets up and goes to the kitchen.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     You don't have a clean glass in the

<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER

t     I'll have to wash one out.
<b>t
</b>tHe turns on the faucet in the kitchen. He brings the glass.
<b>t

<b>t
</b>tGeorge takes the drink. Lester just shakes his head.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>t     Hell of a way to treat a business
t     partner, that's all I can say.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Who?
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Me!
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t          (after a moment)
t     I was gonna give you the money.
t     Probably I was. Shit, I don't know,
t     I don't know anything anymore.
<b>t
</b>tLester sits and stares into his drink.
<b>t

t     a man at my age, how long have I

t     wish I knew... what I was living
t     for.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge looks at him.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>t     ... You can lose it all; you can
t     lose it all no matter who you

t     point of having it all. Look at me.
t     I don't have a goddam thing... the

t     down ten points last week, goddam
t     Lyndon Johnson!
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Oh yeah...
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Yeah,, it goes up a little and then
t     it goes down, maybe Nixon will do
t     something. What's the difference,
t     they're all a bunch of jerks. I
t     wouldn't let 'em run my business, I
t     can tell you that much. Not if I
t     had any choice in the matter.
t          (after a moment)
t     I don't know what to do with you. I
t     don't know, I don't know what's

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I don't either, Lester, I swear to

<b>t

<b>t

<b>t

<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER

<b>t

</b>t     No --
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Just a whore, I go over there, have

t     I'm through with her, she's nothing
t     but a whore.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     No, man, no. You can say
t     everybody's a whore. She's okay. I

t     that much. Somewhere she really
t     likes you, Lester, and it's not
t     just the bread. She's okay.
<b>t
</b>tLester sits and thinks about that.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER

<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER

tsomething.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER (CONT'D)

<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What?
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER
</b>t     Yeah, the clap. That's what she
t     thinks. But who knows -- I don't

<b>t
</b>tGeorge nods. Lester shakes his head.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>t     I don't know anything anymore.
<b>t
</b>tHe opens the door and goes out. The two hoods are standing

</b>t          (to hoods)
t     Go easy on him, he's a nice boy.

tpunch.
<b>t
</b><b>t               LESTER (CONT'D)

t          (to hoods)

<b>t

topen and he barges in. He's met by Jackie's Yorkies who bark
tfuriously, jumping up and down, nipping his pantlegs for
tattention.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE'S VOICE

tsome pasta.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Where are you going?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     Please, we'll have to talk later --
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Look about last night --
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t          (exasperated but not
t          unkind)
t     Forget about last night, it's okay,
t     we'll talk when I get back --
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     It's not okay, I mean we've got to
t     talk now. Where are you going?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     Look -- either you leave or I leave
t     because I don't want the two of us
t     here when Lester arrives. I just
t     don't --
<b>t
</b>tThe level of her nervousness has just risen about fifty
tdecibels. There's the SOUND of a CAR outside.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>t     My God that's him --
<b>t
</b>tGeorge looks out the window.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     -- It's Malone's.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     That's it, then I'm leaving.
<b>t
</b>tWith that she tosses the spoon onto an end table and rushes
tout the door. George starts after her. The DRY CLEANER comes
tto the door, stopping George.
<b>t
</b><b>t               CLEANER
</b>t     Cleaners.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge has to fumble with Jackie's cleaning and keep the dogs
tcontained. He does, tosses the cleaning down and races
toutside to his bike.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE STREET
</b><b>t
</b>the sees Jackie's car rounding the corner, going up the hill,
twinding around the curves. George guns his bike and takes off
tafter her.
<b>t
</b><b>tAROUND WINDING CURVES - GEORGE
</b><b>t
</b>talmost sideswipes a car parked on a hairpin turn. Jackie's on
tthe curve above him.
<b>t
</b><b>tAT THE NEXT CURVE - GEORGE
</b><b>t
</b>tcatches up with her, pulls even to her.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Pull over, pull over!
<b>t
</b>tHe threatens to run her into the curb. She stops the car
tsharply and jumps out.
<b>t
</b><b>tAT THE TOP OF THE DRIVE
</b><b>t
</b>tThey've reached a cul de sac where there's a parched 'view
tlot' not built on.
<b>t
</b>tYellow October weeds cover it and there's a huge television
tantenna in its center which sways slightly in an afternoon
twind.
<b>t
</b>tJackie has run onto the lot, then slows to a walk. She grabs
tone of the rusty stays of the swaying antennas, stares down
tbelow her.
<b>t
</b>tHer house can be seen from this angle, the Malone's truck
tjust pulling away.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge comes up to her.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t          (looking below her)
t     You're going to kill me.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     No --
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t          (turning to him,
t          imploring)
t     Well then what are you trying to do-
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I want to marry you. I want to take
t     care of you and I want your
t     children, and I want you to be my
t     girl. That's all I want. That's all
t     I want out of my life, and it's a
t     lot.
<b>t
</b>tShe stares at him in disbelief. She actually clutches her
tstomach.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>t     Look, I don't know if I'll ever
t     make it. I mean I'm a fuckup, but
t     I'll take care of you, I'll make
t     you happy, I swear to God I will.
<b>t
</b>tJackie doesn't answer. She slowly sinks to the ground. George
tsinks beside her. Her eyes are wet.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>t     Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for
t     God's sake, answer me.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     If you knew how many times I wanted
t     to hear you say that...
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     So I'm saying it...
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     It's too late...
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What's too late about it? Look,
t     we're not dead, are we? That's the
t     only thing that's too late.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     Lester's left Felicia. He's taking
t     me to Acapulco on the five o'clock
t     flight. He's asked me to marry him.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     So what? You don't love him, do
t     you? Answer me.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     What's that supposed to mean?
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I don't know... Jackie?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     What?
<b>t
</b>tGeorge now is very near tears himself. What he says now he
thas to force out of himself, as if it's the biggest secret he
tholds.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     I don't trust... anyone... but
t     you...
<b>t
</b>tGeorge lets his head fall on her shoulder. She's kneeling,
tsupported by the television aerial, and George cries quietly
ton her shoulder. She has her arm around him.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     Oh my baby...
<b>t
</b>tAs she's holding George, and looking down the hill, Lester's
tsilver Rolls pulls up. Lester gets out of the car, goes to
tthe front door.
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>t     God, there's Lester...
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Don't go, Jackie...
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     I can't just let him stand by the
t     door...
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     Don't leave me...
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     I've got to... I've got to tell him
t     where I am.
<b>t
</b><b>t               GEORGE
</b>t     What for?
<b>t
</b><b>t               JACKIE
</b>t     I don't know -- I've got to.
<b>t
</b>tShe gets up and hurries over to her car, starts it and goes
tback down the hill. George sits under the television aerial
tand watches her car go down the hill, periodically flashing
<b>tINTO VIEW.
</b><b>t
</b>tFinally she pulls up while Lester is pacing back and forth.
tShe hurries to him. He taxes her by the shoulders. They talk
tfor a moment. The discussion looks like Jackie is giving
tLester directions. She glances uneasily up toward George.
<b>t
</b>tGeorge is watching them.
<b>t
</b>tHe sees that Lester and Jackie have their backs to him, his
tarm around her shoulder, hers around his waist. They're going
tthrough the front door.
