<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD x96 TOMOKOx92S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
  CLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  Therex92s a baseball game on, but the sound 
  is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school 
  girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee 
  table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS 
  all over the room, and itx92s obvious there hasnx92t been much studying going 
  on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.

<b>ttttMASAMI
</b>ttThey say that some elementary school 
ttkid spent the night with his parents 
ttat a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid
ttwanted to go out and play with everybody, 
ttright, but he didnx92t want to miss the 
ttprogram he always used to watch back in 
ttTokyo, so he records it on the VCR in 
tttheir room.  But of course the stations 
ttin Izu are different from the ones in 
ttTokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty 
ttchannel, so he shouldx92ve recorded
ttnothing but static.  But when the kid 
ttgets back to his house and watches the 
tttape, all of a sudden this woman comes 
tton the screen and says--

  Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko 
  actually jumps in her seat.

ttttMASAMI (contx92d)
ttx93One week from now, you will die.x94

  Short silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment.

ttttMASAMI (contx92d)t
ttOf course the kidx92s completely 
ttfreaked, and he stops the video.  
ttJust then the phone rings, and when he 
ttpicks it up a voice says--

  Her voice drops voice almost to a whisper.

ttttMASAMI (contx92d)t
ttx93You watched it, didnx92t you?x94  That 
ttsame time, exactly one week later... 
tthex92s dead!

  Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance.  
  Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more 
  and more distressed, until finally Masami notices.

<b>ttttMASAMI
</b>ttWhat is it, Tomoko?

  Tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her 
  friend.  Her words are quick, earnest.

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>ttWho did you hear that story from?

<b>ttttMASAMI
</b>ttWho?  Itx92s just a rumor.  Everybody 
ttknows it.

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>ttYouko told you?t

<b>ttttMASAMIt
</b>ttNo, it wasnx92t Youko...

  Tomoko looks away, worried.  Masami slaps her on the knee, 
  laughing.

<b>ttttMASAMI
</b>ttWhatx92s up with you?

  Tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away.

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>ttThe other day, I... I watched this 
ttstrange video.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttMASAMI
</b>ttWhere?

<b>ttttTOMOKOt
</b>ttWith Youko and them.

<b>ttttMASAMIt
</b>ttt(excited) 
ttSo thatx92s what Ix92ve been hearing 
ttabout you doing some double-date/
ttsleepover thing!  So, you and that 
ttguy Iwata, huh? 

<b>ttttTOMOKOt
</b>ttNo, itx92s not like that.  Nothing 
tthappened!

  Their eyes meet and Tomoko half-blushes, looks away again.  Her 
  expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation.

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>ttIwata... he found this weird video.  
ttEveryone was like, x93Whatx92s that?x94 so 
tthe put it on and we all watched it.

<b>ttttMASAMI
</b>ttt(quietly) 
ttAnd?  What kind of video was it?

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>ttJust... weird, I canx92t really explain 
ttit.  Anyway, right after we finished 
ttwatching it, the phone rang.  Whoever
ttit was didnx92t say anything, but still...

  Silence.  Masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked.  

<b>ttttMASAMIt
</b>ttJesus.

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>  ttIt's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the 
ttrumors.

Tomoko looks seriously over at her friend.

ttttTOMOKO (cont'd)
ttThat was one week ago today.

  There is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything.

<b>ttttMASAMI  t
</b>ttWaaait a minute.  Are you faking me 
ttout?

  Tomokox92s face suddenly breaks into a smile. 

<b>ttttTOMOKOt
</b>ttBusted, huh?

  They both crack up laughing. 

<b>ttttMASAMI
</b>ttOh, my... I canx92t believe you!  

  Masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee.

ttttMASAMI (contx92d)
ttYoux92re terrible!

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>ttGotcha!

<b>ttttMASAMIt
</b>ttt(thinking) 
ttBut hang on... you really stayed
ttthe night with Youko and Iwata, 
ttright?

  Tomoko nods, uh-huh.  Masami dives forward, pinching her friendx92s 
  cheeks and grinning wildly.

<b>ttttMASAMIt
</b>ttSo, how far did you and he get?

<b>ttttTOMOKO t
</b>ttOh... I canx92t remember.

<b>ttttMASAMIt
</b>ttYou canx92t remember, huh?

  Masami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers 
  the trick her friend played on her.

<b>ttttMASAMIt
</b>ttMan, you had me freaked me out. 
<b>ttI--
</b>
  Just at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, 
  instantly serious.  Tomokox92s eyes go off in one direction and she 
  begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, 
  following her friendx92s gaze.  

  Tomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40.

  The phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her 
  friend, looking panicked.

<b>ttttMASAMI
</b>ttt(softly) 
ttWas it true?

  Tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to 
  forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, 
  so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko 
  calls out to her from behind.

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>ttMasami!

<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD x96 STAIRCASE - NIGHT  
</b>
  Tomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards 
  the kitchen.  Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen.

<b>ttttTOMOKOt
</b>ttMasami!

<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD x96 KITCHEN - NIGHT  
</b>
  Masami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She 
  pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She 
  takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The 
  tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks 
  into a huge grin.

<b>ttttMASAMIt
</b>ttIx92ll put her on.

  Still grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.  Tomoko snatches it 
  quickly.

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>ttt(softly) 
ttYes?

  She is silent for a moment, then smiling widely.  

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>ttOh, man!

  She is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she 
  sinks to the kitchen floor.  Masami, equally relieved, slides down 
  the wall and sits down next to her.

<b>ttttTOMOKO
</b>ttt(on the phone) 
ttYeah, Ix92ve got a friend over now.  
ttYeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye.

  Tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then 
  squats back down onto the kitchen floor.

<b>ttttTOMOKOt
</b>ttThe gamex92s gone into overtime, so 
tttheyx92re gonna be a little late. 

  They burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both 
  clutching their stomachs.

<b>ttttTOMOKOt
</b>ttJeeezus, my parents...

<b>ttttMASAMIt
</b>ttOh man, Ix92m tellinx92 everybody about 
ttthis tomorrow!

  Tomoko shakes her head, -Donx92t you dare-.

<b>ttttMASAMIt
</b>ttIx92m gonna use your bathroom.  Donx92t 
ttgo anywhere.

<b>ttttTOMOKOt
</b><b>ttx91K.
</b>
  Masami walks out of the kitchen. Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks 
  toward the SINK, where she takes a GLASS from the DISH RACK.  She 
  then goes to the FRIDGE and sticks her face in, looking for something 
  to drink.  Suddenly there is the SOUND of people clapping and 
  cheering.  Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator 
  door to check for the source of the sound.  

  She begins walking slowly, following the sound to the DINING ROOM 
  adjacent the kitchen. 

<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - NIGHT  
</b>
  The lights are off, and there is no one in the room.  Tomoko pauses a 
  moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched
  on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the 
  same game that Tomokox92s parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up 
  quite high.

  A puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee 
  table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen.

<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD x96 KITCHEN - NIGHT  
</b>
  A bottle of SODA that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on 
  the kitchen table.  She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink.  
  Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly 
  charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight 
  comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING.  
  Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt 
  lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream.

  The screen goes white, and fades into:

<b>  CAMERA POV 
</b>
  The screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking YOUNG GIRL.  
  She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen.

<b>ttttASAKAWA (O.S.)
</b>ttThere seems to be a popular rumor 
ttgoing around about a x94cursedx94 
ttvideotape.

<b>ttttYOUNG GIRLt
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttASAKAWA (O.S.) 
</b>ttHave you heard what kind of video 
ttit might be?

<b>ttttYOUNG GIRLt
</b>ttUh-huh.

  The girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an x93Ox94 
  as shex92s suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright.  She continues 
  staring, silently, at the camera.

<b>  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY  
</b>
  KOMIYA, the cameraman, has lowered his camera. We can now see that 
  the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two 
  friends, a SHORT-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL#2) and a LONG-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL #3).  
  They are all dressed in the UNIFORMS of junior high school students.  
  Opposite them sits Komiya and Asakawa, a pretty woman in her mid-
  twenties.  A BOOM MIKE GUY stands to the left.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKOMIYAt
</b>ttUh, donx92t look right at the camera, 
<b>ttOK?
</b>
<b>ttttYOUNG GIRLt
</b>ttSorry.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttLetx92s do it again.

  Asakawa glances over her shoulder, makes sure that Komiya is ready.

<b> 
</b><b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttHave you heard what kind of video 
ttit might be?

<b>ttttYOUNG GIRL
</b>ttWhat I heard was, all of a sudden 
ttthis scaaarry lady comes on the
ttscreen and says, x93In one week, you
ttwill die.x94


<b>ttttGIRL #2t
</b>ttI heard that if youx92re watching TV 
ttlate at night itx92ll come on, and
ttthen your phonex92ll ring.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttWatching TV late at night... do you
 ttknow what station?

<b>ttttGIRL #2t
</b>ttMmmm... I heard some local station, 
ttaround Izu.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttIzu?

<b>ttttGIRL #2t
</b>ttMmm-hmm.t

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttAnd, do you know if anyonex92s really 
ttdied from watching it?

  The girl flashes a look at her two friends.

<b>ttttYOUNG GIRL
</b>ttWell, no one that we know, right?

  Girl #2 nods her head. Girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her 
  mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not.  The 
  reporter notices. 

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttWhat is it?


<b>ttttGIRL #3
</b>ttI heard this from a friend of mine 
ttin high school.  She said that there 
ttwas this one girl who watched the 
ttvideo, and then died a week later.  
ttShe was out on a drive with her 
ttboyfriend.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttThey were in a wreck?

<b>ttttGIRL #3
</b>ttNo, their car was parked, but they 
ttwere both dead inside.  Her 
ttboyfriend died because hex92d watched 
ttthe video, too.  Thatx92s what my 
ttfriend said.

  Girl #3 grows suddenly defensive.

ttttGIRL #3 (contx92d)t
ttItx92s true!  It was in the paper two 
ttor three days ago.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttDo you know the name of the high 
ttschool this girl went to?

<b>ttttGIRL #3
</b>ttNo... I heard this from my friend, 
ttand it didnx92t happen at her school.  
ttShe heard it from a friend at a 
ttdifferent school, she said.

<b>  INT. NEWS STATION x96 DAY
</b>
  Asakawa is seated at her DESK.  The station is filled with PEOPLE, 
  scrabbling to meet deadlines.  Komiya walks up to Asakawax92s desk 
  and holds out a MANILA FOLDER.

<b>ttttKOMIYAt
</b>ttMrs. Asakawa?

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttHm?

<b>ttttKOMIYAt
</b>ttHere you are.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttt(taking the folder) 
ttThanks.

  Komiya has a seat.

<b>ttttKOMIYAt
</b>ttThis same kind of thing happened 
ttabout ten years ago too, didnx92t it?  
ttSome popular young singer committed 
ttsuicide, and then suddenly there was 
ttall this talk about her ghost showing
ttup on some music show.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttBut I wonder what this rumorx92s all 
ttabout. Everyone you ask always 
ttmentions x93Izu.x94

<b>ttttKOMIYAt
</b>ttMaybe thatx92s where it all started.  
ttHey, where was that Kuchi-sake
ttOnna * story from again?


  >* Literally x93Ripped-Mouth Lady,x94 a kind of ghastly spectre from 
  >Japanese folk stories who wears a veil to hide her mouth, which 
  >has been ripped or cut open from ear to ear. She wanders the 
  >countryside at night asking men x93Do you think Ix92m beautiful?x94 then 
  >lowering her veil to reveal her true features.


<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttGifu, but there was some big 
ttaccident out there, and that ended
ttup being what started the rumor. 

<b>ttttKOMIYA
</b>ttA big accident?

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttMmm-hmm.  Something terrible like 
ttthat is going to stay in peoplex92s 
ttminds.  Sometimes the story of what 
tthappened gets twisted around, and 
ttends up coming back as a rumor like 
ttthis one. Thatx92s what they say, at 
ttleast.

<b>ttttKOMIYA
</b>ttDx92you think something like that 
tthappened out at Izu?

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttMaybe. Well, anyway, Ix92m off.  See you
tttomorrow.
<b>   
</b><b>ttttKOMIYA
</b>ttSee you.

  Asakawa gets up from her desk and begins walking towards the exit.  
  She takes only a few steps before noticing a RACK of recent DAILY 
<b>  EDITIONS.  
</b>
  She takes one from the rack, sets it on a nearby TABLE.  She begins 
  flipping the pages, and suddenly spies this story:  

<b>    STRANGE AUTOMOBILE DEATH OF YOUNG COUPLE IN YOKOHAMA
</b>
    The bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their 
    passenger car at around 10 A.M. September 6th.  The location was a 
    vacant lot parallel to Yokohama Prefectural Road.  Local authorities 
    identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student 
    of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a 
    private all-girlsx92 high school. Because there were no external 
    injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced 
    suicide...

  Just then two men walk by, a GUY IN A BUSINESS SUIT and a youngish 
  intern named OKAZAKI.  Okazaki is carrying an armload of VIDEOTAPES.

<b>ttttGUY IN SUIT
</b>ttOK, Okazaki, Ix92m counting on you.

<b>ttttOKAZAKIt
</b>ttYessir.

  The guy in the suit pats Okazaki on the shoulder and walks off.  

  Okazaki turns to walk away, spots Asakawa bent over the small table 
  and peering intently at the newspaper article.


<b>ttttOKAZAKIt
</b>ttMiss Asakawa?  I thought you were 
ttgoing home early today.

  Asakawa turns around and begins speaking excitedly.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttOkazaki, can I ask you a favor?

<b>ttttOKAZAKI
</b>ttSure.

  Asakawa points to the newspaper.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttCould you check out this article 
ttfor me?  Get me some more info.?t

<b>ttttOKAZAKI
</b>ttI guess...

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttGood.  Call me as soon as you know 
ttmore, OK?

<b>ttttOKAZAKIt
</b>ttMax92am.

  Asakawa walks off.  Okazaki, still carrying the videotapes, leans 
  forward to take a look at the article.
<b>   
</b><b>  EXT. APARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY  
</b>
  Asakawa drives her car into the lot and parks quickly.  She gets 
  out, runs up the STAIRCASE to the third floor.  She stops in front 
  of a door, sticks her KEY in the lock, and opens it.

<b>  INT. ASAKAWAx92S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM x96 DAY
</b>
  A BOY of about 7 is sitting in an ARMCHAIR facing the veranda.  We 
  can see only the back of his head.

<b>ttttASAKAWA (O.S.) 
</b>ttYoichi!

  Hearing his name, the boy puts down the BOOK he was reading and 
  stands up, facing the door.  He is wearing a white DRESS SHIRT with 
  a brown sweater-type VEST over it.  He sees Asakawa, his mother, 
  run in the door.  She is panting lightly.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttSorry Ix92m late.  Oh, youx92ve already 
ttchanged.

<b>ttttYOICHI
</b>ttYup. 

  He points over to his motherx92s right.

ttttYOICHI (contx92d)
ttI got your clothes out for you.

  Asakawa turns to see a DARK SUIT hanging from one of the living 
  room shelves.  She reaches out, takes it.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttAargh, wex92ve gotta hurry!

  She runs into the next room to change.

<b>  INT.  BEDROOM x96 DAY
</b>
  Asakawa has changed into all-black FUNERAL ATTIRE.  Her hair is 
  up, and she is fastening the clasp to a pearl NECKLACE.  Yoichi is 
  still in the living room.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttDid grandpa call?

<b>ttttYOICHI (O.S.) 
</b>ttNope.

  Yoichi walks into the room and faces his mother.

<b>ttttYOICHIt
</b>ttWhy did Tomo-chan die? *


  >* x94-chanx94 is a suffix in Japanese that denotes closeness or affection.  
  >It is most often used for young girls, though it can also be used for 
  >boys.


<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttWell... it looks like she was really, 
ttreally sick.

  She takes a seat on the bed.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttWill you do me up?

  Yoichi fastens the rear button of his motherx92s dress and zips her up.  

<b>ttttYOICHIt
</b>ttYou can die even if youx92re young?

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttIf itx92s something serious... well, yes.

  Asakawa turns to face her son, puts an arm around him.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttAs hard as it is for us, what your 
ttauntie and uncle are going through 
ttright now is even harder, so letx92s 
ttnot talk about this over there, OK?

  Yoichi nods.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttt(remembering)
ttYou and her used to play a lot 
tttogether, didnx92t you?

  Yoichi says nothing.

<b>  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT  
</b>
  RED PAPER LANTERNS mark this place as the site of a wake.  Several 
  GIRLS in high school uniforms are standing together and talking in 
  groups. Asakawa and Yoichi, walking hand in hand, enter the house.

<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 
</b>
  There are many PEOPLE milling about, speaking softly.  A MAN seated 
  at a counter is taking monetary donations from guests and entering 
  their information into a LEDGER.  Asakawa and Yoichi continue walking, 
  down a hallway.

<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 
</b>
  Mother and son halt before the open DOOR to the main wake room, where 
  guests may show their respects to the departed.  The room is laid in 
  traditional Japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that 
  serves as a carpet. Two GUESTS, their shoes off, are kneeling upon 
  zabuton cushions.  

  Kneeling opposite the guests is KOUICHI, Asakawax92s father.  The two 
  guests are bowing deeply, and Kouichi bows in response.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttDad.

  Kouichi turns to see her.

<b>ttttKOUICHI
</b>ttAh!

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttHow is sis holding up?

<b>ttttKOUICHI
</b>ttShex92s resting inside right now.  
ttShex92s shaken up pretty badly, you 
ttknow.  Itx92s best she just take 
ttthings easy for a while.

  Asakawa nods.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttIx92ll go check on auntie and them, 
ttthen.

<b>ttttKOUICHI
</b>ttOK.  Ah, Yoichi.  Why donx92t you sit 
tthere for a little while?

  He grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests.  
  As the guests resume their conversation with Asakawax92s father, Yoichix92s 
  eyes wander to the ALTAR at the front of the room set up to honor the 
  deceased.  It is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and 
  small paper lanterns.  At the center is a PICTURE of the deceased, a 
  teenage girl.  A small wooden PLAQUE reads her name: Tomoko Ouishi. It 
  is the same Tomoko from the first scene.

  Yoichi continues to stare at Tomokox92s picture.  He makes a peculiar 
  gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just 
  between his eyes.

<b>  INT. HALLWAY x96 NIGHT
</b>
  Asakawa walks down the hallway, looking for her aunt.  She walks until 
  finding the open doorway to the kitchen.  There are a few people in 
  there, preparing busily. Asakawa sees her AUNT, who rushes into the 
  hallway to meet her, holds her fast by the arm.  The aunt speaks in a 
  fierce, quick whisper.

<b>ttttAUNTtt
</b>ttHave you heard anything more about 
ttTomo-chanx92s death?

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttNo, I...

<b>ttttAUNTtt
</b>ttBut the police have already finished 
tttheir autopsy!

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttWell, they said there was no sign of 
ttfoul play.

<b>ttttAUNTt
</b>ttt(shaking her head) 
ttThat was no normal death.  They havenx92t 
ttonce opened the casket to let us see
ttthe body.  Donx92t you think thatx92s 
ttstrange?
<b> 
</b>  Asakawa looks away, thinking.

<b>  INT. HALLWAY x96 NIGHT
</b>
  Yoichi has wandered off by himself.  He stops at the foot of the 
  steps, looking up-- and catches a glimpse of a pair of BARE FEET 
  running up to the second floor.  

  A guarded expression on his face, Yoichi walks slowly up the 
  stairs.  

<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOx92S BEDROOM - NIGHT  
</b>
  Yoichi has wandered into Tomokox92s bedroom.  The lights are all off, 
  and there is an eerie feel to it.  Yoichix92s eyes wander about the

  hears his motherx92s voice from behind him.

</b>ttWhat are you doing up here?  You

  Without replying, Yoichix92s gaze slowly returns to the television

  her.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttYou go on downstairs, OK?

  She hangs up the phone.

  Asakawa stands now at the entrance of the house.  Dazedly, she 
  walks toward a large, hand-painted PLACARD.  The placard reads 
  that the wake is being held for a student of the Seikei School 
  for Women. 

  Asakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections.  
  She turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby TRIO of HIGH SCHOOL

<b>  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH x96 DAY
</b>
  Asakawa and YOSHINO, another news reporter, are watching scenes 
  from the Yokohama car death.  In the footage there are lots of 
  POLICEMEN milling about, one of them trying to pick the door to 
  the passenger side.  Yoshino is giving Asakawa the blow-by-blow.

<b>ttttYOSHINO
</b>ttThe bodies of those found were 
ttTsuji Youko, age 17, a student of 
ttthe Seikei School for Women, and 
ttNomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory

ttwere securely locked.

  Onscreen, the policeman has finally picked the lock.  The door opens, 
  and a girlx92s BODY halfx96falls out, head facing upwards.  Yoshino flicks 
  a BUTTON on the control panel, scans the footage frame by frame.  He 
  stops when he gets a good close-up of the victim. 

  Her face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear, mouth open, eyes 
  wide and glassy. Yoshino and Asakawa lean back in their seats.

<b>ttttYOSHINO
</b>ttThis is the first time Ix92ve -ever-

</b>ttThe autopsy came up negative.


  Yoshino takes the video off pause.  Onscreen, a policeman has caught 
  the young girlx92s body from completely falling out, and is pushing it 
  back into the car.  As the body moves into an upright position, we 
  can see that the girlx92s PANTIES are mid-way around her left thigh.

<b>  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DAY  
</b>
  Asakawax92s CAR is already halted before a modest-sized, two-story HOUSE 
  with a small covered parkway for a garage.  She gets out of her car, 
  closes the door.  She stares at the house, unmoving.

<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD x96 KITCHEN - DAY  
</b>
  Asakawa stands before her SISTER RYOMI, who is seated at the kitchen 
  TABLE.  Ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging 
  her sister.  The silence continues unabated, and Asakawa, pensive, 
  wanders idly into the adjoining dining room.  She takes a long look at 
  the television, the same television that had puzzled Tomoko by suddenly 
  switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner.  Her reflection in 
  the screen looks stretched, distorted.


<b>ttttRYOMIt(O.S.) 
</b>ttThey tell me that Yoichi came to 
ttthe funeral, too. 

  Asakawa steps back into the kitchen.  She addresses her sister, who 
  continues to stare out at nothing.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttMmm-hmm.

<b>ttttRYOMI
</b>ttThey used to play a lot together, didnx92t they?  Upstairs.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttYeah...

  Ryomi lapses back into a silence.  Asakawa waits for her to say more, 
  but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives 
  up and exits the kitchen.

<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD x96 STAIRCASE - DAY  
</b>
  Asakawa climbs the steps to the second floor.  She makes her way down 
  the hall.

<b>  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOx92S ROOM - DAY  
</b>
  As if intruding, Asakawa walks slowly, cautiously into Tomokox92s room.  
  The window to the room is open, and a single piece of folded white PAPER 
  on Tomokox92s desk flutters in the breeze.  Asakawa walks towards it, picks 
  it up.  It is a RECEIPT from a photo shop.  The developed photos have yet 
  to be claimed.  

  Asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder.  Her sister 
  has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the 
  doorway to Tomokox92s room.  She appears not to notice what Asakawa has in 
  her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door.  
  She regards it almost druggedly.

<b>ttttRYOMI
</b>ttt(haltingly) 
ttThis... this is where Tomoko died.

<b>  FLASHBACK
</b><b>ttttRYOMI (O.S.)
</b>ttTomoko!

  Ryomix92s hands fling aside the CLOSET DOOR.  Within, she finds the pale 
  blue CARCASS of her daughter, curled up into an unnatural fetal position.  
  Tomokox92s mouth yawns gaping, her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back 
  of her head.  Her hands are caught in her hair, as if trying to pull it 
  out by the roots.  It is a horrific scene, one that says Tomoko died as 
  if from some unspeakable fear.

<b>  PRESENT
</b>
  Ryomi sinks to her knees, hitting the wooden floor hard.  She puts her 
  face into her hands and begins sobbing loudly.  Asakawa says nothing.

<b>  EXT. CAMERA SHOP x96 DAY
</b>
  Asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching Tomokox92s unclaimed PHOTOS.  She 
  walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them.  We see 
  Tomoko standing arm-in-arm with Iwata, her secret boyfriend. Tomoko and 
  her friends eating lunch.  The camera had its date-and-time function 
  enabled, and the photos are marked

<b>    97 8 29.
</b>
  The next shot is of Tomoko, Iwata, and another young couple posing in 
  front of a SIGN for a bed and breakfast.  The sign reads:

<b>    IZU PACIFIC LAND
</b>
<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttIzu...

  Asakawa continues looking through the photos, various shots of the 
  four friends clowning around in their room.  Suddenly she comes to a 
  shot taken the next day, at check out.  The friends are lined up, arms 
  linked-- and all four of their faces are blurred, distorted as if 
  someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them out of 
  existence.

<b>  INT. ASAKAWAx92S APARTMENT x96 KITCHEN - DAY

  a few stirs, staring off and thinking.

<b>  EXT. IZU PACIFIC LAND - DRIVEWAY x96 DAY
</b>
  Asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is 
  less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental 
<b>  COTTAGES. 
</b>
  She wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings.  She pauses 
  now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her PURSE.  She 
  withdraws the PICTURE from the photomat, the one that showed Tomoko and 
  her friends with their faces all blurred.  The four are posing in front 
  of their cottage, marked in the photograph as x93B4.x94  Asakawa lowers the 
  photo to regard the cottage before her.

<b>    B4
</b>
  She walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally.  Itx92s open.  
  Asakawa walks in.

<b>  INT. PACIFIC LAND - COTTAGE B4 x96 DAY
</b>
  Asakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage.  It looks very modern, 
  all wood paneling and spacious comfort.  

  Her eyes rest on the TV/VCR setup at the front of the room.  Crouching 
  before the VCR now, she presses the eject button.  Nothing happens.  
  She fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind 
  to the rear of the VCR, searching.  Again, there is nothing.  Asakawa 
  presses the power button on the television, picks up the REMOTE, and 
  takes a seat on the SOFA.  She runs through a few channels but theyx92re 
  all talk shows, no clues whatsoever.  She flicks the TV off and leans 
  back in the sofa, sighing.

  Just then, she spies a LEDGER on the coffee table.  These things are 
  sometimes left in hotels in Japan, so that guests can write a few 
  comments about their stay for others to read.  Asakawa picks the 
  ledger up, begins thumbing through it.  She stops at a strange PICTURE
  obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely 
  round personages.  She reads the handwritten MESSAGE.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>tt"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.  
ttThatx92s why Ix92m fat, too."

  She smiles in spite of herself.  

  Asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but therex92s nothing else 
  of any import.  

  She tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into 
  the sofa and closes her eyes.

<b>  EXT. OUTDOOR CAFxc9 - DUSK

<b>  INT. PACIFIC LAND - FRONT RECEPTION - NIGHT

  Asakawa has returned to the bed and breakfast.  As she walks in the 
  door, the COUNTER CLERK rises out of his chair to greet her.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttRoom for one?

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttUm, actually Ix92m here on business.

  She passes the clerk a picture of Tomoko and her three other friends.  
  He stares at it for a moment.



<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttThey would have stayed here on 
ttAugust 29th, all four of them.  
ttIf therex92s any information you 
ttmight have...

</b>ttUh, hang on just a minute.  

  The clerk turns his back to her, begins leafing through a guest log.

<b>ttttCLERKt
</b>ttt(to himself) 
ttAugust 29th...

  While she waits, Asakawax92s eyes start to wander around the room.  
  Behind the desk is a sign reading x93Rental Video,x94 and a large wooden 
  BOOKSHELF filled with VIDEOTAPES. They are all in their original boxes, 
  and she lets her eyes glance over the titles.  Raiders of the Lost Ark, 
  48 Hours--

  --and then, suddenly, she spies a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked 
  sleeve, tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf.  She feels 
  the hairs on the back of her neck rise.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttThat...

  The clerk looks up.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttHmm?

  Asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf.


<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttThat!  What tape is that?

  The clerk reaches out for it, grabs it.

<b>ttttCLERKt
</b>ttThis?  Hmm...

  The clerk pulls the tape out of its SLEEVE and checks for a label.  
  Itx92s unmarked.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttMaybe one of the guests left it behindx85

<b>  INT. PACIFIC LAND x96 COTTAGE B4 - NIGHT 
</b>
  Asakawa flips on the TV.  Itx92s on channel 2, and there is nothing but 
  static. She kneels down to slide the tape into the deck and pauses a 
  moment, framed in the vaguely spectral LIGHT from the television 
  screen.  Steeling her nerves, she puts the tape into the machine, picks 
  up the remote, and presses play.


  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this 
  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP 
  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.  Afterwards, you can 
  come back here to check the meaning of the Japanese characters 
  displayed.


<b>  THE VIDEOTAPE
</b>
  At first it looks like nothing has happened-- then Asakawa realizes that 
  she is now viewing recorded static instead of broadcast static.  She 
  watches, waiting, but the static continues unbroken.  Asakawa looks 
  down at the remote, is about to press fast forward, when suddenly the 
  picture on the screen clears and for a moment she thinks shex92s looking 
  at the moon.

  Itx92s not the moon at all, she realizes.  The shape is round like a full 
  moon, but it seems to be made up of thin RIBBONS of cloud streaking 
  against a night sky.  And therex92s a FACE, she sees, a face hidden in 
  shadows, looking down from above.  

  What is this?

  The scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of 
  grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies.  The scene is of 
  a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve-
  wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the 
  background, but the lady doesnx92t seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is 
  using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of 
  the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the 
  mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its 
  changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns 
  towards where that figure stood, and smiles.

  The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the 
  kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out 
  only two things recognizable:

    local     volcanic eruption

  Now the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling 
  masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies 
  them.
<b>  -
</b>
  A FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, 
  not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The 
  insect-like screeching sounds louder. 
<b>  --
</b>
  Close up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.  Inside that eye a single 
  character is reflected in reverse:  SADA, meaning "chastity."

  The eye blinks once, twice.  The symbol remains.
<b>  ---
</b>
  A long shot of an outdoor, uncovered WELL.
<b>  ----
</b>
  Sudden loud, blinding STATIC as the tape ends.

  Asakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily 
  and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the 
  television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown 
  standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, 
  spins around.

  The room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket--

  --and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie-
  like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly.  

  From the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid SQUEAKING heard on 
  the video.  Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the CLOCK.  
  Itx92s about seven minutes after 7 P.M.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt

  Asakawa grabs her coat, pops the tape out of the deck, and runs out the 
  door.

<b>  EXT. STREET x96 DAY
</b>
  It is dark and raining heavily.  Yoichi, Asakawax92s son, is walking to 
  school, UMBRELLA firmly in hand.  The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi 
  comes to a halt when a second PERSON comes from the opposite direction, 
  blocking his way. Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at 
  this other pedestrian.  It is a MAN, a BAG slung over one shoulder.  He 
  has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm.  

  The two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor 
  speaking.  Yoichi then walks around the personx92s left and continues on his
   way.  The man resumes walking as well.

  The bearded man, whose name is RYUJI, reaches out to press the DOORBELL, 
  but the door has already opened from within.  Asakawa leans out, holding 
  the door open for him.  Neither of them speaks.  Wordlessly, Ryuji enters 
  the apartment.

<b>  INT. ASAKAWAx92S APARTMENT - DAY  
</b>
  Ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment.  The interior is dark, 
  ominous somehow.  He takes his JACKET off and wanders into the living room.  
  Asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing TEA.  Ryuji spies the 
  collection of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS in living room.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttYoichix92s in elementary school

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttHis first year.  What about you, 
ttRyuji?  How have you been 
ttrecently?

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttSame as always.

  She takes a seat next to him, serves the tea.  On the coffee table 
  before them is a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked case.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttAnd money is...?

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttIx92m teaching at university.

  Ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops, grimacing, before it is to his 
  lips.  He rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache.  Ryuji 
  shakes it off and quickly regains his composure.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttAnyway.  You said that the phone rang?

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttThatx92s right.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttSo if I watch it too, that phone over 
ttthere--

  He gestures with his mug

ttdied.  On the same day!

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttt(flippant) 
ttWell, why donx92t you try calling 
ttan exorcist?

  He takes a sip of his tea.  Asakawa reaches quickly, grabs something 
  from the bookshelf behind her-- a POLAROID CAMERA.    She shoves it 
  into Ryujix92s hands, then turns to look down at the floor.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttTake my picture.

  Ryuji raises the camera to his eye.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttTurn this way.


<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttt(unmoving) 
ttHurry up and take it.

  Ryuji snaps off a shot.  It comes out the other end and he takes it, 
  waits impatiently for an image to appear.  When it does, all he can 
  do is pass it wordlessly over to Asakawa.  Her face is twisted, 
  misshapen.  

  Just like the picture of Tomoko and her friends.

  Asakawa stares at it, horrified.  By the time she finally looks up, 
  Ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the 
  VCR.  Again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced 
  with what looks like the moon.  Asakawa slams the Polaroid on the 
  coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda.

  him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.  A PAIR 
  OF LEGS attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, 
  heading directly for Ryuji.  Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as 
  that pace progresses all other sounds FADE into the background, so 
  that all we can hear is the CLOMP, CLOMP as those legs walk to stand 
  just before Ryuji.  The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime.  

  A gust of WIND rips by.  Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his 
  ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced BABBLING heard on the

  The babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worldx92s normal 
  background sounds return.  Ryuji looks up, but the woman in white 
  is nowhere to be seen.

<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIx92S APARTMENT x96 AFTERNOON
</b>
  Ryuji rides up on a BICYCLE. He turns the corner towards his 
  apartment and finds Asakawa seated on the steps, waiting for him.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttHey.

  Asakawa notes in his face that something is wrong.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b> ttWhat happened to you?

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttt(gruffly)
ttNothing.

  He enters the building, carrying his bicycle.  Asakawa follows.

<b>  INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON  
</b>
  The two walk down the hallway towards the FRONT DOOR to Ryujix92s 
  apartment.  He unlocks the door and they enter.

<b>  INT. RYUJIx92S APARTMENT x96 AFTERNOON
</b>
  Ryuji and Asakawa enter the living room.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttSo, whatx92d you come up with?

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttI donx92t think any of the guests on 
ttthe list brought the tape with them.  
ttI couldnx92t confirm it face-to-face 
ttof course, but even over the phone I 
ttgot the feeling they were all being 
ttupfront with me.

<b> ttttRYUJI
</b>ttHow about the other angle?  Pirate 
ttsignals or...

  Asakawa shakes her head.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttTherex92re no traces of any illegal 
tttelevision signals being broadcast 
ttaround Izu. 

  She reaches into her purse, pulls out a large white ENVELOPE.


<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttHerex92s that copy of the videotape 
ttyou wanted.

  Ryuji tears the package open.  He squats down on the tatami in 
  frontof his TV and slides the tape in.  Asakawa sits on the 
  tatami as well, but positions herself away from the TV and keeps 
  her eyes averted.  Ryuji glares over his shoulder at her.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttt(sternly) 
ttAsakawa.

  She reluctantly scoots closer, looks up at the screen.  Ryuji 
  fast-forwards the tape a bit, stopping at the scene where the 
  woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror.  He puts 
  the video on frame-by-frame. 

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttHave you ever seen this woman?

  Asakawa regards the screen intently.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b> ttNo...

  The tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes 
  positions.  When it does, we can again see the small figure in the 
  white gown, a figure with long black hair. When Ryuji sees this 
  his body stiffens, becomes tense.  Asakawa notices but says nothing.  
  She also notices something else.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttt(excitedly) 
ttTherex92s something strange about 
ttthis shot.

  She takes the remote from Ryuji, rewinds it a ways.  Onscreen, the 
  woman begins coming her long hair again.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttFrom this angle, the mirror should 
ttbe reflecting whoeverx92s filming.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttSo, what does that mean?

  Asakawa lets out a short sigh.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttWell, if the person who made this 
ttis a pro, therex92d be a way around 
ttthat, I guess, but still...

  The screen changes, showing the mass of squiggling kanji characters 
  again.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttt(reading) 
ttVolcanic eruption... Eruption where?

  He pauses the screen, trying to make sense of what is written.


<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttThis is gonna be impossible to figure 
ttout on just a regular TV screen, 
ttdonx92t you think?

  They are both still staring at the screen when from behind them comes 
  the SOUND of someone opening the front door.  Ryuji turns off the TV, 
  ejects the tape from the deck.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttCome on in.

  Asakawa flashes a look at Ryuji and then turns her head back towards 
  the front door to see who has entered.  A cute, nervous-looking young 
  GIRL with short hair approaches slowly.  She is carrying a PLASTIC BAG 
  filled with groceries.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttAsakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai.

  He turns, addresses Mai.

ttttRYUJIt(contx92d)t
ttThis is Asakawa, my ex-wife.

  Ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away.

<b>ttttMAItt
</b>ttNice to meet you.  Ix92m Takano.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttAsakawa. *

  >first name is x93Reiko.x94  In this scene, Mai deferentially refers
  >to Ryuji as sensei, meaning x93teacher.x94


  Mai sets the bag of groceries down and chases after Ryuji.  He is 
  putting on his jacket and getting ready to leave.

<b>ttttMAIt
</b>ttSensei, the people from the 
ttpublishing company called about

<b>ttttMAItt
</b>ttBecause they can never get a

  Ryuji picks up his keys, video firmly in hand.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttAsk them to wait another week.

<b>ttttMAItt
</b>ttSensei, ask them yourself, 
ttplease.

  Ryuji is already headed for the door.  His back is to her as he 
  responds.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b><b>ttOK, OK.
</b>
  Asakawa walks after him.  They leave.

  Mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea 
  crosses her mind.  She walks across the room to where Ryuji has set 
  up a large BLACKBOARD filled with mathematical equations.  Grinning, 
  Mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a 
  new value.

<b>  INT. NEWS STATION x96 HALLWAY - NIGHT  
</b>
  Asakawa and Ryuji stride purposefully.  They stop before a DOOR to 
  the right, which Asakawa unlocks.  They both walk in.

<b>  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH - NIGHT 
</b>
  Asakawa and Ryuji sit in a completely darkened room, their eyes 
  glued to the television MONITOR.  They are again watching the scene 
  with the fragmented kanji characters, but despite their efforts have 
  been able to identify only one additional word, bringing the total 
  to three:

tvolcanic eruptiont  localt     residents

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttThis is impossible.

  Ryuji fast forwards, stopping at the scene with the kanji reflected
  inside an alien-looking EYE.  He reads the kanji aloud. 

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttSada... 

  Ryuji moves to make a note of this, notices the time.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttIs Yoichi gonna be all right?

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttt(sadly) 
ttHex92s used to it...

  Short silence.  Ryuji breaks it by gesturing towards the screen. 


<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttWhoever made this had to have left 
ttsome kind of clue behind.  Theyx92re 
ttprobably waiting for us to find it.

  Asakawa turns a DIAL to bring up the volume, which up until now has 
  been  on mute.  The room is filled with an eerie, metallic GRATING, 
  and Asakawa spins the dial again, shutting it off.  Just as she does, 
  Ryujix92s eyes widen.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttWait a minute.

  He turns the dial again, punches a few buttons as if searching for 
  something.  He listens carefully, and when he hears that strange 
  something again he stops, looks at the screen.

  It is paused at the scene with the figure, pointing, a CLOTH draped 
  over its head.  The figure now looks oddly like a messenger.

  Ryuji and Asakawa exchange glances.  This could be it.  Ryuji flips 
  some more switches, setting the sound for super-slow mo.  What follows 
  is a strange, labored sort of speech-x97 a hidden message-- framed in 
  the skittering distortion of the tape in slow motion.

  Asakawa nods.  Ryuji is already writing it down excitedly.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttWhat does that mean?

  Ryuji tears the sheet of paper off the notepad, folds it, and tucks 
  it into his shirt pocket.

<b>  EXT. ASAKAWAx92S APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING

  Yoichi is walking to school.  He looks back over his shoulder, just 
  once,then resumes walking.

  Just when the girl in the interview mentions that whomever watches 
  the video is supposed to afterwards receive a phone call, Asakawax92s 
  own phone RINGS, startling her. She runs to answer it.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttHello?

<b>ttttRYUJI (O.S.)
</b>ttIx92ve got it.  Itx92s a dialect, just 
ttlike I thought.  SHOUMON means 
ttx93playing in the waterx94 and BOUKON
 ttmeans x93monster.x94 *


  >* Translated from standard Japanese, the phrase from the videotape 
  >would initially have sounded like, "If only SHOUMON then the 
  >BOUKON will come."  These two capitalized words, later identified to 
  >be dialectical, were at the time completely incomprehensible to Ryuji 
  >and Asakawa.  Dialect can vary dramatically from region to region in

  >The phrase on the tape can now be rendered, "If you keep playing in

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttBut, dialect from where?

</b>ttOshima.  And the site of our

<b>  INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT  
</b>
  Ryuji and Asakawa are seated at cubicles, looking through bound 
  ARCHIVES of old newspaper articles.  Asakawa sneaks a look at Ryuji, 
  stands up and walks off a little ways.  She has already pulled out her 
  cell phone.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttt(whispering, on phone) 
ttYoichi?  Ix92m gonna be a little 
ttlate tonight, honey. 

  Ryuji looks over his shoulder at her, scowls.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttYou can do it yourself, right?  OK.  
ttSorry.  Bye.

  She hangs up, returns to her seat at the cubicle.  She resumes her 
  scanning of the newspaper articles, and Ryuji shoots her another scowl.  
  Asakawa turns a page and then stops, frowning.  She has spied an article 
  that looks like...

  Nervously, Asakawa puts the thumb and forefinger of each hand together, 
  forming the shape of a rectangle.  Or a screen.  She places the rectangle
  over the article she has just discovered, its headlines reading:

  Ryuji notices her, leans forward excitedly.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttIx92ve got it!  This old article...

  The two scan the remainder of the page, and find a smaller, related 
  article.t

    Did Local Girl Predict Eruption?
    A young lady from Sashikiji prefecture...

  The two read over both articles, absorbing the details.  Ryuji stands 
  suddenly, gathering his things.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttWhat are you doing?

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttHas your newspaper got someone out 
ttthere at Oshima?

</b>ttI need you to find out, and let me

  He begins walking briskly away.  Asakawa chases after him.

</b>ttt(angrily) 
ttYoux92ve only got four days left,

  Ryuji strides off.  Asakawa stands motionless.

<b>  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY  
</b>
  A car speeds along.  CUT to a gravel DRIVEWAY leading up to a wooden, 
  traditional-style HOUSE.  Kouichi, Asakawax92s father, is standing before 
  the entrance and puttering around in his GARDEN.  The car from the 
  previous shot drives up, comes to a halt.  The passenger door opens and 
  Yoichi hops out, running towards the old man.  Asakawa walks leisurely 
  after her son.

  Asakawa stands on a RIVERBANK while her father and Yoichi, GUMBOOTS on, 
  are ankle-deep in a shallow river.  Yoichi holds a small NET, and 
  Asakawax92s dad is pointing and chattering excitedly. 

<b>ttttKOUICHI
</b>ttThere he is!  Cx92mon, there he is,

</b>ttThat was your fault, grandpa.

  Asakawax92s father laughs.

  He begins sloshing noisily out to the center of the stream, Yoichi in

  Asakawa looks away, pensive.

<b>  INT. KOUICHIx92S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Yoichi is passed out asleep on the tatami mats.  A TELEVISION looms 
  inone corner of the living room, but it is switched off.  The 
  SLIDING DOORS to the adjacent guest room are open and we can see 
  futons set out, ready for bed.

  Asakawa enters the living room and, seeing Yoichi, scoops him up in
  her arms and carries him over to the guest room.

<b>ttttYOICHI

  Ryuji is crouched in front of the TV, REMOTE in hand.  The screen is 
  paused on the scene of the woman brushing her long hair.

<b>ttttRYUJI (O.S.)
</b>ttIx92ll be in touch.

  Ryuji hangs up.  Asakawa, deep in thought, slowly places the phone 
  back in its CRADLE.  She turns around to walk back down the hallway 
  only to find her father standing there, face full of concern.

<b>ttttKOUJI
</b>ttWhatx92s happened?

  Asakawa shakes her head.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttNothing.  I just had some things

  She walks past her father, who glances worriedly after her over his 
  shoulder.

<b>  INT. KOUJIx92S HOUSE - GUEST ROOM x97 NIGHT
</b>
  The lights are all off and Asakawa is asleep in her futon.  Her eyes 
  suddenly fly open as a VOICE sounding eerily like her deceased niece 
  Tomoko calls out to her.


<b>ttttTOMOKO (O.S.) 
</b>ttAuntie?

  Asakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings.  Her eyes fall on 
  the futon next to hers.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttYoichi?

  There is a BODY in that futon, but it is full-grown, dressed all in 
  black.  It is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned 
  away.

  Suddenly, the IMAGE from the video of the figure with its face 
  shrouded springs to Asakawax92s mind.  Just an instant, its pointing 
  visage materializes, and then disappears.  It reappears a moment 
  later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again.  

  Asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is 
  empty.  Yoichi is nowhere to be seen.

  Just then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic SQUEAKING from the 
  video.  Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart--
  --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi.

  He is watching the video.

  It is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. 
  CLOSEUP on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that 
  something is trying to claw its way out of the well.  The video cuts 
  off, and the screen fills with static.  

  Shrieking, Asakawa races over to Yoichi, covers his eyes though it is 
  already too late.  She scoots over to the VCR, ejects the tape and 
  stares at it uncomprehendingly.  She is then at Yoichix92s side again, 
  shaking him roughly.

</b>ttYoichi!  You brought this with you,

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttThis kind of thing... it doesnx92t

  the length of the gangplank towards the shore.  A man named MR.

</b>ttSeparate, please.

</b>
  Kazue gives a little bow.

<b>ttttKAZUE
</b>ttThis way.

  Kazue turns to the right.  Almost immediately after reaching the 
  top of the steps, however, a strange look crosses Ryujix92s face.  
  He heads down the opposite end of the corridor, Asakawa close 
  behind.

<b>ttttKAZUE
</b>ttt(alarmed) 
ttSir!

  Ryuji flings open the SLIDING DOOR to one of the older rooms.  There, 
  hanging from one of the walls, is the oval-shaped MIRROR from the 
  video, the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair.  
  Ryuji stares at the mirror, almost wincing.  He turns around as if 
  to look at Asakawa,but continues turning, looks past her.  Asakawa 
  follows his gaze, as does Kazue.  Standing at the end of the corridor 
  is an old man, MR. YAMAMURA. 

  Yamamura regards them silently, balefully.  Breaking the silence, 
  Kazue gestures for Asakawa and Ryuji to follow.

<b>ttttKAZUE
</b>ttt(softly) 
ttPlease, this way.

  Asakawa races past the innkeeper towards the old man.  He keeps his 
  back turned towards her.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttPlease!  If you could just answer 
tta few questions, about Shizuko...

<b>ttttYAMAMURA
</b>ttI got nuthinx92 to say.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttItx92s about Shizukox92s daughter.

  The old man says nothing.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttShe did have a daughter, didnx92t she?

  Yamamura regards her for a moment, then turns to walk away.

<b>ttttYAMAMURAt
</b>  ttYoux92re wasting your time.

<b>  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA - DINING ROOM x96 NIGHT
</b>
  The TABLE is laid out with an elaborate-looking DINNER.  Asakawa 
  sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened.  
  She is whimpering softly to herself.  Just then, the DOOR slides 
  open and Ryuji walks in.  He sits at the table and picks up a 
  pair of CHOPSTICKS.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttArenx92t you gonna eat?

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttUmm...

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttHm?

</b>ttYoux92ll stay with me wonx92t you?  
ttWhen itx92s time for me to die.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttOh, stop it.

  Asakawa scoots across the tatami mats towards the table, grabs 
  Ryuji fiercely by the arm.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttYoux92ll stay, wonx92t you?  If you 
ttstayed, maybe youx92d learn something
ttthat could help Yoichi--

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttI said stop it!  Have you forgotten 
ttThere was a girl with Tomoko when 
ttshe died?  That girlx92s now in a 
ttmental institution.  Who knows what 
ttcould happen. 

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttBut you could stay with me, Ryuji.  
ttYoux92d be OK.


<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttt(angrily)
ttWhy, because Ix92m already not 
ttright in the head?

  Asakawa releases her hold on Ryujix92s arm, lowers her head.  Ryuji 
  slams his chopsticks down angrily.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttIf thatx92s the case, why not just
ttlet things run its course, get rid
ttof father -and- son?  Yoichi was a
ttmistake, anyway.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttStop it!

  Short silence.  When Ryuji speaks up again, his voice is soft, 
  reassuring.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttWe still have two days left...

  Just then the VOICE of the innkeeper calls tentatively out from 
  the other side of the sliding door.

<b>ttttKAZUE (O.S.) 
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttCome in.

  Kazue slides the door open.  She stands hesitantly in the doorway, 
  something tucked under one arm.


<b>ttttKAZUEt
</b>ttItx92s about Miss Shizuko.  

  Ryuji shoots a glance at Asakawa and stands up from the table, 
  walks towards the innkeeper.

<b>ttttKAZUEt
</b>ttThis is all that there is...

  Kazue produces an old black and white PHOTOGRAPH.  The photo shows a 
  WOMAN, seated, dressed in a KIMONO.  A MAN in a Western-style SUIT 
  stands beside her.  

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttIs this Professor Ikuma?

  Hearing this Asakawa leaps up, walks over to examine the picture for 
  herself.

<b>ttttKAZUE
</b>tt...yes.  This picture is from before 
ttIx92d entered the household.  

  She pauses a moment.

ttttKAZUE (contx92d)
ttI should go now.

  The innkeeper scuttles off, leaving Asakawa and Ryuji alone with the 
  photograph.  Unbidden, the VOICE from the video enters their 
  thoughts.

  Asakawa watches Ryuji stride down the shore.

  Ryuji strolls up to find old man Yamamura sitting alone, staring 
  out at the sea.  Yamamura glances up to see Ryuji approaching.  
  Ryuji takes a seat next to the old man, but itx92s Yamamura who speaks 
  first.  The deep basso of his voice emphasizes the drawl of his 
  accent.

  Yamamura rises unsteadily to his feet, features twisted angrily.

<b>ttttYAMAMURA
</b> ttPlease leave!  Now!

  Ryuji stands, takes hold of Yamamurax92s arm.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttIx92ve got a little of that ability

</b>ttWhatx92re you--?

</b>ttYou thought youx92d be able to make 
ttsome money off her.  You even got 
ttsome, from one of the newspapers.

<b>ttttYAMAMURAtt
</b>ttLeave me the hell alone!

  Mr. Yamamura strides angrily off.  Both Ryuji and Asakawa take 
  pursuit, Ryuji calling out from behind Yamamurax92s back.


<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttTell us about Shizukox92s daughter.  
ttWho was she?

<b>ttttYAMAMURAt
</b>ttI donx92t know!

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttShe was there, with Shizuko. She 
tthad to be.

  Yamamurax92s pace, which has become increasingly erratic, finally 
  causes him to stumble and fall.  Ryuji comes up behind him, 
  grasping him firmly.  At their touch Ryujix92s power awakens, and as 
  he peers into the old manx92s mind there is a sudden blinding

<b>  FLASH
</b>
  The setting is a large MEETING HALL.  A number of people are seated 
  in folding chairs before a STAGE, on which are a four MEN in BUSINESS 
  SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO.  A BANNER hangs above the stage, which 
  reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.  

<b>  FLASH
</b>
  Ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing Shizukox92s demonstration 
  before the press.  He also realizes--

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttt(to Yamamura)
ttYou were there!

<b>  FLASH
</b>
  YAMAMURA SHIZUKO, the woman in the kimono, is sitting at a TABLE 
  onstage. Her face is calm and expressionless.  Standing off to one 
  side and peering from behind the curtains is a young Mr. Yamamura.

<b>ttttRYUJIt(O.S.) 
</b>ttYou stood there and watched the 
ttdemonstration.

  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa comes running up toward Ryuji and the 
  prone Mr. Yamamura.  Suddenly there is another

<b>  FLASH
</b>
  Asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it 
  as if she had actually been there.  She watches as Shizuko receives 
  a sealed clay POT in both hands.  Shizuko regards the pot a moment 
  and then places it gently on the table before her.  She takes a 
  calligraphy STYLUS from the table, begins writing on a thin, 
  rectangular sheet of RICE PAPER.  The members of the press talk 
  excitedly, craning their necks for a better look.

  Onstage, a JUDGE holds up the phrase written by Shizuko and the 
  folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot.  The phrase on both 
  sheets is identical.

<b>ttttJUDGEtt
</b>ttMatch.

  Cameras begin FLASHING excitedly.  Shizukox92s features melt into a soft 
  smile. 

  The experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by 
  Shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper.

<b>ttttJUDGE
</b>ttMatch.

  Again and again, Shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to x93seex94 
  the unseen.  Finally, a bearded REPORTER explodes from his chair, 
  begins striding angrily towards the stage.

<b>ttttREPORTERt
</b>ttFaker!  This is nothing but trickery, 
ttand the lowest form of trickery at 
ttthat. 

  The reporter stops at the foot of the stage, points his finger 
  accusingly at Shizuko.

<b>ttttREPORTERt
</b>ttWhat are you trying to pull, woman?

  A SECOND REPORTER sitting in the front row also rises to his feet.

<b>ttttREPORTER #2t
</b>ttThatx92s right!  Professor Ikuma, 
ttyoux92re being fooled!

  By now most of the press has risen from their chairs, pointing and 
  shouting angrily. Onstage, Shizuko backs away, eyes wide and 
  frightened.  She covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing 
  din.  Professor Ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders.  The 
  first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the 
  others.  Suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to 
  the floor.  The crowd, and Asakawa as well, see that the reporterx92s 
  face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear.

<b>ttttREPORTER #3t
</b>ttWhatx92s happened?

<b>ttttREPORTER #4t
</b>ttHex92s dead!



<b>ttttREPORTER #5t

  Professor Ikuma begins leading Shizuko offstage.  They stop as someone 
  unseen steps up, blocking their passage.  Shizukox92s eyes widen, her 
  head shaking in disbelief.

<b>ttttSHIZUKO
</b>ttSadako?  Was it you?

  CUT to Ryuji on the beach.  He looks up excitedly.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttSadako?!

  He recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single 
  character SADA reflected in reverse. *


  >* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi ("beauty") 
  >or -ko ("child").  Thus, Sadako means "Chaste child."  Sadako is, of 
  >course, the mysterious daughter of Shizuko and Professor Ikuma.


<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttSadako killed him?  She can kill 
ttjust with a thought?

<b>ttttYAMAMURAt
</b>ttShex92s... a devil spawn.

  CUT back to the demonstration hall.  Sadako, her face completely hidden 
  by her long hair, runs offstage... and heads directly for Asakawa.  
  Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely.  
  All the nails on Sadakox92 hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw, 
  bloody stumps.

  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the 
  vision, has begun to swoon.  Finally her legs give out and she crumples 
  to the beach.  Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively.  He glances down at 
  her wrist, sees an ugly, purple BRUISE already beginning to form.  

  The bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers.

  Mr. Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three 
  watch the approach of ominous, dark STORM CLOUDS.

<b>  INT. MR. HAYATSUx92S HOUSE x96 DUSK

  Asakawa is on the phone, her voice almost frantic.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttThatx92s right. After Yamamura Shizuko 
ttcommitted suicide, Professor Ikuma
tttook the daughter and ran.  No, no one

ttEven if the professorx92s dead, Sadako 
ttshould still be in her forties.  Ix92ll 
ttexplain it all later, but right now 
ttjust hurry!

  Asakawa slams the phone down.  PAN to show Ryuji slumped in one corner 
  of the room, his back to the wall.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttSadakox92s probably already dead.  She
ttcould kill people with just a thought,

  Ryuji turns to regard Asakawa, his eyes blank.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttWex92ve been cursed.

  There is a moment of silence before Mr. Hayatsu slides the door open, 
  almost falling into the room.  He is out of breath, and speaks rapidly.

<b>ttttHAYATSUt
</b>ttItx92s no good.  With the typhoon 
ttcoming in, all ships are 
tttemporarily staying docked.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttWhat about the fishing boats?  
ttTell their captains Ix92ll pay.

<b>ttttHAYATSU
</b>ttFishing boats?  Sir, without knowing 
ttwhether this typhoon is going to hit 
ttus or not, I think itx92d be better to 
ttwait and see how things turn--

  Ryuji interrupts him, slamming both palms on the table.  Glasses 
  rattle wildly.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttFine!  Ix92ll try searching myself!

  Ryuji stands and races past Mr. Hayatsu out into the rain.  Hayatsu 
  takes pursuit, calling after him.

<b>ttttHAYATSUt
</b>ttMr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...

  Asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats.

  Asakawa sits at a table, alone, her hands clasped as if in prayer.  Her 
  eyes are wide and glassy.  The phone RINGS suddenly and Asakawa dives 
  for it, wrenching it from the cradle before it can ring a second time.

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttHello?

<b>ttttOKAZAKI (O.S.) 
</b>ttMrs. Asakawa?  Ix92m sorry.  I tried,

  into herself.

</b>ttHello?

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttt(softly)

  Asakawa slowly places the phone back in its cradle.  Almost immediately, 
  her face begins to crumple.  She falls to her knees, sobbing into the 
  floor.

  around.   She continues scanning, and suddenly she spies--

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttt(calling)

  Asakawa runs down onto the wharf, heading towards Ryuji.  He is 
  in mid-conversation with Mr. Hayatsu.

  The three spin around to see Mr. Yamamura, his ROBES flapping in the 
  gusty night air. He begins walking towards them.

</b>ttSadako is callinx92 yx92all, reckon.

</b>ttPlease.  Take us out.

  Ryuji races out of the store, loaded down with supplies.  He holds a 
  pair of BUCKETS in one hand and a CROWBAR and SHOVEL in the other.  A 
  length of ROPE is coiled over his left shoulder.  He runs towards a

ttSay hello to grandpa for me, OK?

  Ryuji stands by the car, scowling over at Asakawa.  He shuts the DOOR 
  just short of a slam.  CUT to Asakawa hanging up the phone.  She half-
  runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring 
  blankly into space.  Ryuji slides into the driverx92s seat, buckles his

  Asakawa sits in the passenger side.  Her face is almost angelic, 
  with the faintest hint of a smile.  Ryuji shoots a questioning look 
  at her.

<b>  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD x96 DAY
</b>
  The white rental car tears past the SIGN reading Izu Pacific Land.  
  The car continues into the LOT, screeching around corners before 
  coming to an abrupt halt.  Asakawa, her face still oddly expressionless, 
  gets out of the passenger side.  Ryuji exits as well, the hint of a 
  shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>tt-Here-.

  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji walking up the gravel PATH towards the rental 
  cabins.  Ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and Asakawa stop 
  before cabin B4.  The cabin is on STILTS, its underbelly fenced off by 
  wooden LATICEWORK.  Ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but 
  keeps hold of the PICK.  He raises the pick over one shoulder and begins 
  smashing away at the latticework.  When he has cleared enough space for   
  passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within.  
  When finished, he holds a hand out for Asakawa.  The two enter the 
  earthen basement.


<b>  UNDER COTTAGE B4 - DAY  
</b>
  Ryuji pulls a FLASHLIGHT out, flicks it on.  The BEAM arcs outwards, 
  illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern 
  rental cottage.  The beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old 
  STONE WELL.  The well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off 
  with a solid-looking stone LID.  Ryuji rushes quickly towards it.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttI knew it!  The well.

  He squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the 
  lid.  Asakawa sinks slowly down beside him.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttThe well...

  Ryuji reaches out and takes Asakawax92s hand.  He sets their enclasped 
  hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the 
  surface of the lid with their free hands.  Asakawa closes her eyes in 
  concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, 
  Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryujix92s psychometric VISION.

  The picture is black and white, grainy like old film.  A YOUNG GIRL in 
  a WHITE GOWN walks slowly towards an open well. She places her hand on 
  the LIP of the well, peers curiously down.  

<b>  FLASH
</b>
  Asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open.

<b>  FLASH
</b><b>  
</b>  There is now a second person in the vision, an ELDERLY MAN in an old-
  fashioned tweed SUIT standing behind the young girl.  He suddenly 
  produces some BLADED OBJECT, and strikes the girl savagely across the 
  back of the head.  

  The girl falls forward. The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl 
  behind the knees and hoisting her limp BODY over the lip and into the 
  well.  The body falls into its depths.

  Panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well 
  with both hands, looking down.  He flashes a guilty look in either 
  direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does 
  so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face.  The image from the 
  videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well, 
  looking up to see this man staring back down at her.

  This man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro.

<b>  FLASH
</b>
<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttHer own father!

  The energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body 
  crumbles.  Ryuji catches hold of her.

<b>ttttRYUJItt
</b>ttIt was Ikuma who put this lid on.  
ttAnd Sadakox92s still inside.

  Ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar.  He inserts it under 
  the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort.  
  Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. Slowly,
  the lid begins to move.  Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two 
  lean the combined weight of their bodies into it.  The lid slides off, 
  dropping to the earth with a dull THUD.  Ryuji sits to one side, winded 
  with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight.  She shines it 
  down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. What 
  WATER she can see looks fetid and brackish.  Ryuji sees her expression 
  and begins removing his JACKET.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttIx92ll go.

  He walks off, leaving Asakawa alone.

  CUT to an overhead shot of the well.  A ROPE is fastened to one side, 
  and Ryuji has already begun lowering himself down.  His eyes wander 
  overthe grime-smeared WALLS, and with a shudder he begins to pick out 
  human FINGERNAILS.  Torn loose and spattered with blood, countless 
  fingernails line the sides of the well. 

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b> ttSadako was alive!  Shex92d tried to 
ttclimb her way out.

  Ryujix92s face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing 
  Sadakox92sterrible agony.  He waits a moment longer before edging his 
  way down the rope again, finally SPLASHING to rest at the bottom of 
  the well.  He holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up 
  to Asakawa.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttLower the buckets!

  Asakawa nods and lowers two plastic BUCKETS fastened to a rope.  Ryuji 
  grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water, tugging on the rope when 
  finished.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttTake it up!

  Asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well.  She walks a small 
  distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground.  She happens to 
  glance through the wooden lattice to the outside, and with a start 
  realizes that the sun has already started to set.  A nervous glance at 
  her WATCH later and she is back at the well, lowering the empty bucket 
  to find another full one already awaiting her.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttTake it up!

  In the well, Ryuji glances at his watch.  He looks at it for a long 
  moment, the expression on his face saying Wex92re not going to make it.  
  Time passes as Asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload, her 
  strength beginning to fade.  She half-stumbles, glances up... and is 
  shocked to realize that NIGHT has fallen.

  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket, her strength 
  almost gone.  She looks at her watch and sees that it is now past 
  6:00.  She calls frantically down to Ryuji.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttItx92s already six!

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttt(explosively) 
ttI know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!

  The bucket slowly jerks into motion.  Asakawa pulls it up to the rim 
  of the well, holds it unsteadily.  She takes one faltering step and 
  falls, spilling the bucketx92s contents onto the ground.  

  CUT to Ryuji in the well, standing ready with another bucketful.


<b>ttttRYUJI
</b> ttTake it up!

  Nothing happens.  

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttAsakawa!

  The bucket begins moving, even slower than before.  CUT to Asakawa, 
  her body trembling with effort. By now itx92s all she can do to simply 
  keep her body moving.  She glances behind her, sees through the wooden 
  lattice that it is now pitch black.  A look of resignation crosses her 
  face and she releases her hold on the bucket, her body crumpling and 
  falling in on itself. 
<b>  
</b>  CUT to the bucket splashing back into the well, narrowly missing 
  Ryuji.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttt(fuming) 
ttWhat the hell are you doing?  Trying 
ttto get me killed?

  CUT back to Asakawa, her face dead.  Ryuji calls out from the well.

<b>ttttRYUJI (O.S.) 
</b>ttHey!

  Asakawa falls backward onto the ground, arms splayed. CUT to the rim 
  of the well.  Ryuji pulls himself up over the rim, catches sight of 
  Asakawa.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttAsakawa!

  She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttWex92ll change.  Youx92re in no condition 
ttto keep this up.

  Asakawa suddenly springs into life.  Her voice is frantic, fearful.

<b>ttttASAKAWA:t
</b>ttNo!

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttWho do you expect to pull up these 
ttbuckets, then?

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttBut, we donx92t even know if itx92s doing 
ttany good...

  Ryuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek.  
  He begins shaking her roughly for good measure.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttAnd what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his
ttmother not coming to pick him up 
ttafter all?

  He releases his hold on her.  The two stare at each other a long time, 
  saying nothing.
<b> 
</b>  CUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT 
  now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with 
  grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright.  
  Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder 
  and down into the well.  The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in 
  and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttDonx92t look down!

  She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning 
  over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, 
  everything becomes monochrome. Itx92s not Ryuji looking down at her at 
  all; itx92s Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shex92s still alive or 
  if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to 
  Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright.

  Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs 
  from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness.  
  Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water.  
  She calls out pleadingly.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttWhere are you?  Please, come out.

  Asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.  A full bucket 
  already awaits.  She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up.  

  She scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending 
  it up.  Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, 
  her voice close to tears.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttPlease.  Where are you?

  Asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes 
  of stagnant water.  With a start, she realizes that her fingers have 
  caught something.  Seaweed?  Asakawa draws her hands close for a 
  better look... and sees that is HAIR.  A thick clump of long, black 
  hair.

  Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching 
  Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawax92s ears are filled with a SOUND 
  like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It 
  is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.  CUT to a 
  shot of Asakawax92s face.  Far from being frightened, her features are 
  oddly placid.  She regards the fearsome thing before her with an 
  almost tender look.  Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long 
  hair.  

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttItx92s you...

  She strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head 
  with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.  Its 
  sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the 
  green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.  Like a 
  mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal 
  remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes 
  begin to glaze.

  CUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttHey!  Asakawa!  Itx92s already 10 
ttminutes past seven!  We did it!

  Down in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.  Her body 
  suddenly falls forward, limp.

<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE B4 x96 NIGHT
</b>
  Three POLICE CARS are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson 
  headlights flashing.   A few COPS walk by, two of them carrying 
  something off in white PLASTIC BAGS.  CUT to Ryuji and Asakawa 
  sitting on the curb.  Asakawa is staring off at something, a BLANKET 
  draped over her shoulder.  

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttWhy would Ikuma have killed her?  
ttHis own daughter...

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttMaybe she wasnx92t his daughter at all.  

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttMaybe her father... wasnx92t even human.

  The two exchange glances.  Ryujix92s gaze falls to Asakawax92s WRIST, 
  which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.  The ugly 
  bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttItx92s gone...  

  He shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttEnough, already.  Itx92s over.  Cx92mon.  
ttIx92ll take you home.

  Ryuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet.

<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE ASKAWAx92S APARTMENT - NIGHT  
</b>
  Ryujix92s white CAR pulls up into the parking lot.  He and Asakawa 
  get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is 
  a long moment where neither of them says anything.

<b>ttttRYUJIt
</b>ttGet some rest.  

  He flashes her the slightest of grins. 

ttttRYUJI (contx92d)
ttI still have a thesis to finish. 

  CUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost 
  metaphoric distance between them. 

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>tt...thank you.

  Ryuji nods silently by way of reply.  He gets into his car and 
  drives off.  Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the 
  entrance of her apartment.

<b>  INT. ASAKAWAx92S APARTMENT x96 BEDROOM x96 MORNING
</b>
  Asakawa walks into her room, sits on the edge of her bed.  It is 
  now morning, and she sits dazedly watching the sun come up.

<b>  INT. RYUJIx92S APARTMENT x96 MORNING
</b>
  Ryuji sits busily scribbling into a NOTEBOOK.  He stops writing a 
  moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of COFFEE.  He 
  glances over at his BLACKBOARD for confirmation when a small scowl 
  crosses his brow.  Itx92s gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly 
  to himself.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttThat girl...

  Ryuji stands, walks over to the blackboard.  He fixes Maix92s little 
  prank with a single chalk stroke. 

<b>  EXT. ASAKAWAx92S APARTMENT x96 VERANDA x96 MORNING
</b>
  Asakawa emerges, taking in the dawn.  At first her face is calm and 
  tranquil... but her features change as the sun almost noticeably 
  darkens and a WIND begins to kick up her hair.  She now looks very 
  anxious.

<b>  INT. RYUJIx92S APARTMENT x96 MORNING
</b>
  Ryuji is busy scribbling away at his notes again.  His hand suddenly 
  ceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint...

  No.

  Breath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face 
  the TELEVISION SET.  He gets out of his seat for a better look, 
  falling to his knees on the tatami. 

  The image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; 
  the shot of the well.  

  The SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic 
  screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls on 
  all fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with 
  terrible foreboding.

  There is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A 
  hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white 
  dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly 
  pulling herself out.  The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills 
  with static as if barely able to contain her image.  

  CUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, 
  and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttt(almost frantic) 
ttWhy?!

  The TELEPHONE rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching 
  in his throat.  He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the 
  television, back to the phone.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttThatx92s it!  Asakawa...

  Ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone.  He takes the receiver but 
  is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn 
  inexorably back to the television.  Sadakox92s shrouded face has filled 
  the entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she 
  jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of 
  Ryujix92s apartment.  Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror.

<b>ttttRYUJI
</b>ttAaargh!

  Sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse.  
  Only her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.  The TIPS of her 
  fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail 
  on them.  She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself 
  forward, coming jerkily to her feet.  The joints of her body twist 
  unnaturally, more insect-like than human.

  Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment 
  as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from 
  his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls 
  to the floor, panting heavily.  

  Sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath 
  her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single EYE burns with manic, 
  unbridled hatred.   

  Its gaze meets Ryujix92s, and his face twists into a grimace as he 
  SCREAMS loudly.

<b>  FLASH

  death.

  Asakawa clutches the RECEIVER to her ear.  She can still hear the 
  sounds of metallic SCREECHING coming from the video, though they are 
  now becoming softer.

<b>  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIx92S APARTMENT BUILDING x96 DAY
</b>
  Asakawa comes running down a side street, turning the corner and 
  making for the entrance to Ryujix92s apartment building.  There is a 
  single GUARD posted at the entrance. He reaches out, catches Asakawa 
  lightly by the arm.


<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttAre you a resident here, max92am?

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttIx92m Takayama Ryujix92s wife!

  The guard drops his hand, and Asakawa makes for the entrance.

<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttIx92m sorry max92am, but theyx92ve already

  Asakawax92s spins around, eyes wide.  Body?

  Mai is there, slumped against one wall. Asakawa comes running up, 
  dropping to her knees and grasping Mai by the shoulders.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttWhat happened?

  Mai shakes her head dreamily.

<b>ttttMAI
</b>ttWhen I got here he was just 
ttlying there...

<b>ttttASAKAWAt
</b>ttDid he say anything to you?  About 
tta videotape?

  Mai shakes her head again, shakes it harder until the breath 
  catches in her throat.


<b>ttttMAI
</b>ttHis face...

  Mai falls into silence, curls up on herself.  Asakawa leaves her 
  and crosses toward the door to Ryujix92s apartment.

<b>  INT. RYUJIx92S APARTMENT - DAY  
</b>
  The front DOOR opens wildly, noisily forward.  Asakawa comes 
  rushing in, eyes darting about the apartment.  She thinks 
  frantically to herself.

<b>ttttASAKAWA (VO)
</b>ttRyuji... why?  Does this mean that
ttYoichi will die, too?  Is the curse 
ttnot broken yet?

  Her gaze falls to the television set.  She dives forward, presses 
  the eject button on the VCR.  Sure enough, the TAPE is still in 
  the deck.  She takes the tape and leaves.

<b>  INT. ASAKAWAx92S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM x96 NIGHT
</b>
  Asakawa walks slowly, dreamily forward.  She drops the videotape 
  loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a CHAIR.  Her eyes 
  fall to the framed photographs of Yoichi on one of the shelves.  
  This snaps Asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering 
  intently to herself, thinking.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttI was the only one to break 
ttSadakox92s curse.  Ryuji... why...?  
ttSomething I did that you didnx92t...  
ttSomething I did that you didnx92t...  

  Asakawa gives up, lowers her face into her hands.  When she looks 
  up again, she happens to glance at the television screen-- and 
  its GLARE reveals that there is someone ELSE in the room with her.  
  It is the figure from the videotape, the silent accuser with the 
  cloth draped over its face.  With a start, Asakawa realizes that 
  the figure is wearing Ryujix92s clothes.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttRyuji?!

  She spins around, but the room is empty.  Asakawax92s mind races.  
  The figure had been pointing towards her BAG.  She stands, 
  rummages in her bag to produce her copy of the cursed videotape.  
  She takes Ryujix92s COPY in her other hand, her eyes darting 
  between the two tapes.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttSomething I did that you didnx92t...

  It suddenly clicks home as Asakawa looks full-on at Ryujix92s 
  version of the tape, plainly marked COPY.

<b>ttttASAKAWA
</b>ttWhat broke the curse was that I copied 
ttthe tape and showed it to someone else!

  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling her VCR from the television stand.  
  A look of almost frightening resolve etches her face.
