<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tJACK BAKER
</b>
tis standing before a dirty window, looking
tout at a dirty city street.  He is wearing a tuxedo.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttHey.

<b>tWIDEN ANGLE
</b>
tIt's the GIRL from this afternoon.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHey.

tJack looks at the Girl, sleepy and warm under the
tbedcovers, then at the rest of the apartment.  
tNot good.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttWhatcha doin' over there?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttGotta go.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttHow come?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttJob.

tThe Girl glances at the bedside clock.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttFunny hours.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFunny job.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttWill I see you again?

tJack looks out at the dirty street again.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo.

tThe Girl doesn't appear terribly unnerved by this.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttt(at the tux)
ttYou weren't wearing that, were
ttyou? Earlier.

tJack shakes his head, taps a brown paper bag on
tthe sill.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBrought it.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttShit, thank God.  You look like a creep.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThanks.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttI mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone
ttwho wore that shit.

tJack smiles, grabs the paper bag, and moves to
tthe door.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey.
ttt(as he stops)
ttYou got great hands.


<b>tEXT.  STREET - JACK
</b>
tJack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing
ta tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with
tthe milieu.  Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an
tall-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before
the hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he
tgoes.  Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel.  
tSlipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at
tthe glittering building as if sizing up an opponent.

<b>ttttDOORMAN
</b>ttHey, Jackie!

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHow goes it, Tommy?

<b>ttttTOMMY (DOORMAN)
</b>ttt(shrugging)
ttAh, you know. Howsa pooch?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttLosing his teeth.

<b>ttttTOMMY
</b>ttNo shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox.
ttI buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust
ttthe taps.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah.
ttt(standing back)
ttJesus, you look like fucking
ttroyalty, Tommy.

tTommy brushes at his new velvet coat.

<b>ttttTOMMY
</b>ttYeah.  The big boys sent it down
ttyesterday.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttAnother five years, huh?

<b>ttttTOMMY
</b>ttLike clockwork.  You got a good
ttmemory, Jackie.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt ain't always a blessing.  My
ttbrother here?

<b>ttttTOMMY
</b>ttt(nodding)
ttHe's got blood in his eye.

tJack glances at his watch, waves to Tommy, and
tmoves into the hotel.


<b>tINT.  HOTEL - ANGLE ON FRANK
</b>
tJack's older brother, FRANK, is pacing outside the
tlounge when he sees Jack approaching.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttGreat.  Terrific.  Glad you could
ttmake it.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHow we doing?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHow we ... ? What, are you kidding
ttme?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttAm I late?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThat's not the point.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(taking out a cigarette)
ttWhat's the point?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou cannot continue to walk in at
ttthe last moment, Jack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou want me to show up late a few
ttnights?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFrank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFrank.  I'm here.  I always get
tthere.  Don't sweat it.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttChrist, will you look at your hair?

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tJack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny
ttinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat's wrong with it?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou look like you just crawled out
ttof bed.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo one's gonna be looking at my
tthair.  Come on, we're on.

tFrank just stands there, bottled up with
texasperation.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttCareful, Frank.  When you get angry your
tttie starts to spin.


tJack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his
thead, follows.  As they move away, a cardboard
tstand-up is revealed.  On it are two 8 X 10 glossies
tof Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters,
tthis: "Tonight!  The Doubly Delightful Tones of the
tFabulous Baker Boys!"

<b>tBAKER BROTHERS
</b>
tas they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge
tand settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent
tthat what the "Fabulous Baker Boys" are, in fact, is a
tpoor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.

<b>tWIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE
</b>
tAs they begin to plink out their "theme song" tables
tof middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana
tdaiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads.
tAfter a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and
tthe couples applaud.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(Mr.  Smile)
ttThank you.  Thank you.  Good evening and welcome
ttto the Starfire lounge.  My name is Frank Baker
ttand eighty-eight keys across from me is my
ttlittle brother, Jack.

tApplause.  Little brother Jack smiles, winks, and takes
ta draw on his cigarette.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing; could do this in his sleep)
ttYou know, my brother and I have been playing
tttogether, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it
ttbeen, Jack?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttTwenty-eight years, Frank.

tApplause.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThat's a lot of water under the
ttbridge, eh, Jack?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttLotta water.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOf course, back then, things were a little
ttdifferent.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just
ttabout the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie
ttLies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would
ttlisten to us was the family cat, Cecil.
ttt(to Jack)
ttWe must have shaved three lives off that cat,
tteh, Jack?

tLaughter. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of
trazor blades.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttBut seriously.  It's been fifteen years since
ttJack and I first stepped on the stage as
ttprofessionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities,
ttand more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later...
ttwell, believe me, we've seen our share of this
ttcrazy country of ours.  But even though we've
ttplayed some of the finest venues in the world ...

tAt this point, Jack begins to mimic his brother's words.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt... There's one place that's always been, for us,
tta very special place, and that place is... this
ttplace, the Starfire lounge.

tJack lays in a few soft bass chords.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhy?  Well, I guess you could just say it's
ttthe ...
ttt(pregnant moment)
tt... people.

tAt which point Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard
tand give birth to the melody of -- what else?  "People.'


<b>tJACK AND FRANK - LATER
</b>tThey exit the stage to applause.


<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThank you.  Remember, room service is available
ttill one A.M. for you late-nighters.


<b>tINT.  HOTEL KITCHEN
</b>
tJack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttDon't make trouble, all right?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWho's gonna make trouble?
ttt(spotting someone)
ttHey, amigo!


<b>tJACK'S POV - MAN
</b>
tin an apron, cutting meat off a huge soup bone,
tlooks up.

<b>tBACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttJack!
ttt(lower)
ttFrank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(the feeling's mutual)
ttYeah, hi, Hector.

<b>ttttHECTOR (MAN)
</b>ttt(re: the soup bone)
ttFor Eddie.  I wrap.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttGracias.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(as they exit)
ttI mean it, Jack.  Behave.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttLike an angel.


<b>tINT.  OFFICE
</b>
tFrank stands across the desk from a YOUNG MAN who,
tdespite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal
tattitude toward the two men in his office.  Jack stays
tin the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture
tany further is to risk contracting some hideous
tdisease.

<b>ttttLLOYD (YOUNG MAN)
</b>ttt(preparing a cash envelope)
ttTerrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThanks, Lloyd.

<b>ttttLLOYD
</b>ttYes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night
ttlike this.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh ... thanks.

tFrank glances at Jack and realizes he should have left
thim in the kitchen with Hector and the soup bone.

<b>ttttLLOYD
</b>ttOnly, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal?  If you
ttwanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go
ttplay with the niggers on State Street.  These
ttblisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some
ttguy dripping ash all over himself while he's
ttplaying 'The Sound of Music.'

<b>tANGLE - JACK
</b>
tSmoke curls out of Jack's nose.  He is utterly still,
tlike a pit bull eyeing a steak.

<b>tBACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>ttttLLOYD
</b>ttOkay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more
tlessons.  By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this.

tLloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and,
tbusiness closed, busies himself with other matters.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us
tback, do you, Lloyd?

<b>ttttLLOYD
</b>ttI'll call you.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I
tthought maybe...

<b>ttttLLOYD
</b>ttI'll call you.

tFrank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttCount it.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttCount it.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJack...

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttCount the fucking money, Frank.

tLloyd looks up.  Jack is staring right into him.
tReluctantly, Frank opens the envelope.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt's all here.
ttt(pulling Jack out)
ttI'll be talking to you, Lloyd.

tLloyd doesn't answer.  He just looks at Jack, smiling
twith amusement.


<b>tEXT.  STREET - JACK AND FRANK
</b>
tJack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped
tsoup bone, dogged by Frank, who's got the cardboard
tstand-up under his arm.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou mind telling me what that was about in there?
ttWas that planned?  
ttOr were you just bored and decided
ttto get creative?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFuck him.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThis isn't the Pine Tree Inn on
ttRoute 81, Jack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFuck him.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(to himself)
ttFuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.

tThe fabulous Bakers walk in silence until they come to
tFrank's car. Frank opens the trunk and starts to put
tthe stand-up away.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSo we on tomorrow night?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(shaking his head)
ttMaybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the
ttSheraton's got appendicitis.

tJack nods and starts to walk away.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey.

tJack stops.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttListen ... why don't you come out to the house
ttthis weekend.  Say hello to the kids.  
ttThey've grown.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI hate your kids, Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou're their uncle.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOnly by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThey don't.  They're always asking about you.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThey tried to electrocute me, Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt was an accident.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt was no fucking accident, Frank. The little
ttone ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttCindy.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttShe threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub.  
ttHow do you explain that?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttShe didn't know what she was doing.
ttYou're too sensitive.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou got weird kids, Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttLook, I just thought if you came out you might
ttsee what you're missing.

tJack just stares at Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttJust think about it, all right?
ttConsider it a standing offer.

tFrank closes the trunk and moves to the driver's side.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing;like a litany)
ttYou want a ride, Jack?  No, Frank,
ttI'll walk.  Okay, Jack, good night.
ttGood night, Frank.

tFrank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb.
tJack watches the taillights burn into the distance,
tthen takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads
tfor home.

<b>tANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING
</b>
tJack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment
tbuilding, where a black labrador is studying him from
ta second story window.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT
</b>
tJack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably
tcluttered.  The most striking item is a vintage phone
tbooth placed against the wall.  As Jack lets himself in,
tEDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over.  He is not
tan overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his
tface that he has a great deal of affection for Jack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the
ttapartment.

tEddie nuzzles the soup bone.  Jack unwraps the paper
tand hands it over.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttTake it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular
ttJohhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth
ttaround here.

tJack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over
tto an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs.  
tHe lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the
tMACHINE.  As Bill Evans' smoky "PEACE PIECE" fills the
ttiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and
twalks over to the old piano near the window.  Settling
tback with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows
tgently on the keys and stares out the open window,
tlistening to the music.


<b>tINT.  PIANO STORE
</b>
tJack and Frank work opposite sides of a large piano
tshowroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color.
tWILLIE, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap
tupright, contemplating his shoes.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat happened to the two Clays, Willie?

<b>ttttWILLIE
</b>ttOut.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhen they coming in?

<b>ttttWILLIE
</b>ttWednesday next.
ttFrank looks across the room at Jack.


<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat d'ya got?,

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBosen black.
ttt(taps a key)
ttFlat.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?

<b>ttttWILLIE
</b>ttWhat's the gig?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttTwo nights.

tWillie just looks at his shoes and shakes his head.
tFrank frowns and glances around.
tAcross the room, Jack pauses before another piano.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhat d'ya got?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(tapping)
ttYamaha white.  Nice.

tFrank moves to another grand and alternates taps with
this brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat do you think?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttTry the black Knable.

tFrank moves to another piano and repeats the process,
twatching Jack for a verdict.
tAfter a moment, Jack nods.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttTag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown,
ttThursday-Friday.  Thanks.

<b>ttttWILLIE
</b>ttMy pleasure.


<b>tINT.  DINER
</b>
tThe brothers sit at a window of a corner diner,
tJack nursing an ice coffee,
tFrank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs.  
tThe glass next to them is cluttered with photographs
tof neighborhood luminaries,
tincluding two of Jack and Frank in their tuxedoes.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou know, I think it's been five years since I
ttsaw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttTrust me, you're not missing anything.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou look awful.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThanks.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttReally.  You sleeping?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOnly on odd days.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(a look)
ttSeeing anyone in particular?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhy the interest?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttBecause I'm your brother.  Because I care about
ttyou. Because sometimes it seems like the most
ttsignificant relationship in your life is with
ttthat goddamn dog of yours.

tJack studies his brother's face.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat about that waitress at the Ambassador?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttUh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttFunny.
ttt(points at his wedding band)
ttStrike a bell?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt's only a ring.  Not a collar.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt's more than that.

tJack smiles and sips his coffee.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttBy the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo thanks.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo, I mean it.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSo do I.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe gotta go, Jack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up
ttthere every couple weeks you feel guilty.  
ttI won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThis time you gotta go.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI don't gotta go.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou gotta go.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSays who?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYour older brother.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou're thirteen months older than me, Frank.
ttThat might've meant something in the Apache
ttclubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttChrist, Jack, it's her birthday.

tJack glances up.  Frank nods.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSo what do you say?
ttThink the city can spare you for an afternoon?

tJack squints out the window.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttOkay.  And don't worry about a present.
ttI got her something from both of us.


<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>
tJack, cradling a pink bakery box in one hand,
tgets out of Frank's car and surveys the street
ton which he grew up.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttMake sure you lock.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tUnless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses
tthree houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth
tof potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity.
tBut it's not Jack's car, so he doesn't press the point.

<b>tBACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttPlace looks good, huh?  I got a neighbor boy to
ttmow the lawn, pick up. Five bucks.  
ttTimes've changed, huh?
ttt(pointing)
ttSee the tree?
ttRemember the job Cecil did on it the day
ttDad planted it?
ttYou can still see the scars on the trunk.  Really.
ttI was looking at it just the other day.
ttJesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat.

tFrank smiles, recalling Cecil's near-demise,
tthen raps on the front door.
tJack studies the tree a moment,
tthen gestures to the tiny ribboned box in Frank's hand.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSo what'd we get her?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou'll see.

<b>tANGLE - FRONT DOOR
</b>
tAt that moment, the door swings open and ELLIE BAKER
tis there, a vibrant woman in her sixties.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttWell, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHow's the birthday girl?

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttA little stiffer, but just as sturdy.

tMrs. Baker hugs Frank, then, a bit awkwardly,
tembraces Jack.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttJohn.  It's good to see you.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(uncomfortable; balancing cake box)
ttGood to see you, Ma.

tJack looks over his mother's shoulder at Frank and
tmimics "John" with a knowing nod.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore.
ttJack. He goes by Jack.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttI thought maybe held gotten over that.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttTwenty years, Ma ...

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttYes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer.
ttJack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl,
ttwe had a pig on the farm named Jack.
ttI guess I just can't help making the association.

tJack's eyes slide over to Frank as if to suggest he
tholds his brother personally responsible for this.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma,
ttJohn Kennedy went by Jack.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttCatholics.  What do you expect?  
ttOh, well, what's in a name, right?
ttLet's go inside and have a look at that cake.

tAs Mrs. Baker exits, Frank leans over to Jack.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttKeep her busy, will ya?
ttI have to set a few things up.

tFrank disappears, leaving Jack alone on the porch
twith the bakery box.  Jack shakes his head,
twondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon,
tthen enters the house.

<b>tINT.  HOUSE
</b>
tThe front room is cluttered with his childhood.  
tMost noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights,
tperfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed
twith age.  Above them, pressed between glass and framed,
tare the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight.
tFinally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog-eared,
tpiled everywhere in drunken stacks.
tThis and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly,
twarily, but with a noticeable dispassion,
tuntil his eyes fall upon a photograph.
tIn it, he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man
tin baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms.

tFrank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean,
tperfectly posed, but Jack, a year younger,
this shirt too big, is caught in profile,
tlooking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttt(entering)
ttWell, now, where's everyone run off to?
ttFrank?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttDownstairs.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttOh.

tAll at once, Jack and his mother realize they are alone.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttWell, shall we cut that cake?

tJack nods and follows her into the kitchen.
tHe places the box on the table and stands off to the
tside while Mrs. Baker sets about preparing things.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttSo. How are you?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFine.  You?

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttOh, fine.

tSilence.
tJack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake.
tHer fingers are trembling.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttBig piece or little?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHuh? Oh, no.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttNone?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'm not much for sweets.

tMrs. Baker nods.


<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttHow's that dog of yours?  What was his name?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttEddie.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttYes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe's losing his teeth.

tMrs. Baker stops and looks up into Jack's eyes.
tSuddenly, a NOISE is heard in the other room.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttSounds like your brothers back with us.


<b>tINT.  KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
tFrank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an
told movie projector and a roll-up screen.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttt(entering)
ttWhat's all this?

tFrank sets the projector down and hands his mother the
ttiny ribboned box.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttGo on.

tJack watches from the kitchen doorway as Mrs. Baker
tpulls the ribbon off the box.  
tInside is a tiny spool of film.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttWhy, what's this?


<b>tINT.  KITCHEN (LATER)
</b>
tBlank screen, curtains drawn, the room dark.  
tFrank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake.  
tMrs. Baker close on his elbow,
tsets her plate on her knees and watches the screen.  
tJack sits off to the side.  
tA title card appears:
t"For Mrs. Ellie Baker, who made it all possible."
tMrs. Baker gives Frank a puzzled look.  
tHe just smiles.

tSuddenly, images spring to the screen,
tobviously footage several years old,
tshowing Jack and Frank as children,
tsitting at the tiny pianos, wearing matching suits,
tsmiling matching smiles as they play for the camera.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttOh my God ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttRecognize these two characters?

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttI thought these were lost.  
ttWhere did you find ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIn the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.
ttt(pointing with his fork)
ttLook, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.

tAs Frank's laughter fills the dark room,
tJack stares with cold fascination at the screen.  
tSuddenly, a jagged cut springs the boys a year later,
tin the same positions, smiling the same smiles.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttt(laughing)
ttOh no!

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI had a boy down at the camera shop cut them
ttall together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't
ttfool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?

tJack says nothing.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttOh, look at you two.  So skinny.
ttAnd those tiny suits ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.

tJack's eyes narrow as the film jumps another year
tand a man enters the frame, obviously by accident.  
tHe is so tall his face cannot be seen.  
tAs he dances quickly out of sight,
the ruffles Jack's hair.

<b>ttttMRS. BAKER
</b>ttThat man.

tAs the film jumps again,
tJack glances at the photograph to his right.
tThe images on the screen flicker softly off
tthe glass of the picture frame.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER (O.S.)
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttOh, look how you're growing.
ttMy little boys ...

tJack's eyes drift from the photograph to his mother
tand brother, sitting close together in the love seat,
tlaughing.  After a moment, their voices fade and Jack
tlooks back to the children on the screen,
tlike two tiny men, mirror images of one another.
tAt first the changes are subtle.  
tLittle Jack's tie is askew, his shirt missing a button.
tBut as the years flick by, the brothers resemble one
tanother less and less, until finally,
tthe little boy that was Jack is completely gone and in
this place is a slouching, tousle-haired adolescent in
trumpled coat and open collar,
ta cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip.  
tA woman's hand darts into the frame and plucks the
toffending cigarette away in a flash.


<b>tINT.  CAR
</b>
tFrank and Jack are parked in front of Jack's building.
tWhispers of steam snake from the
tmancovers in the street.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI made her nervous.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHer hands.  Like that.

tJack holds out a trembling hand.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNah.  Medication.

tJack looks over at Frank.  He nods.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttCouple years, now.
ttt(taps his heart)
ttKeeps the beat steady.  Nothing serious.

tJack considers this a moment, then gets out of the car.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttShe was glad to see you.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT
</b>
tJack lets himself into his apartment and stops.
tAcross the room, curled up on the couch, is a little girl.
tJack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to
tthe bedroom.  As he folds a blanket under her chin,
the pauses. The girl's face is calm, peaceful.


<b>tEXT.  STREET - DAWN
</b>
tThe next morning.  Early.  
tThe sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and
tbeginning to drip out onto the street.  Suddenly,
tRINGING OUT over the rooftops, is "JINGLE BELLS"
t-- not the entire song, just the first two bars,
tover and over.


<b>tIHT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
tJack, on the couch, his arm draped over a slumbering
tEddie, opens his eyes.  Across the room,
tseated at the piano, is NINA, the little girl.
tShe stops playing and turns.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttMorning.  You want coffee?  I made coffee.

tJack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up.
tHe nods to the coffee.  Nina goes to the kitchen.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI did the dishes last night. You're missing a cup.

tJack rubs his head, then gets up and walks to the window.


<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttDid you break a cup, Jack?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttEddie did.

tNina looks at Eddie, sleeping on the couch,
tthen brings Jack his coffee with both hands.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttI practiced the piano last night.  Two hours.
ttI think I'm ready for 'Jingle all the way.'

tJack nods.  Suddenly, the sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS is heard.
tJack and Nina glance up at the ceiling.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttGuess they're up.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSounds big.  What's he do?

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttProcess server.
ttMa said it's like a lawyer only the hours
ttare more regular.  All I know's he came to take
ttthe TV one afternoon and ended up staying for
ttdinner.  And breakfast.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat happened to the donut king?

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttMarried.

tUpstairs, a DOOR SLAMS and HEAVY FEET ECHO in the
tstairwell. Nina peers out the window.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttNo breakfast.  Maybe they had a fight.

tTWO DEEP THUMPS sound on the ceiling.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWell, gotta go.  Teach me later?

tJack nods.
tNina kisses him on the cheek and exits.
tJack walks over to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHey.


<b>tINT.  LUAU LOUNGE
</b>
tThough the plastic palms and grass-skirted waitresses
tof the Luau Lounge make the Fabulous Baker Boys' presence
tseem a bit incongruous, Jack and Frank hold nothing back,
tgiving "McCarthur Park" the full treatment.  
tUnfortunately, the audience in the Luau Lounge wouldn't
tfill a Hawaiian haystack and their applause
tis less than volcanic.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh, thank you.  That concludes our show for this
ttevening.  Jack and I only hope you enjoyed
ttyourselves as much as we did.

tAs the guests wander out, clutching their roomkeys,
ta freckle-faced BELLHOP comes up.

<b>ttttBELLHOP
</b>ttMr. Baker.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(tired)
ttYeah, Jimmy.

<b>ttttJIMMY (BELLHOP)
</b>ttMr. Simpson asked to see you.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttAll right, tell him I'll be right there.

tAs Jimmy exits, Frank stands and points at Jack.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttTomorrow we close with the 'Aquarius Suite.'


<b>tINT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR
</b>
ttFrank pauses before a door marked "HOTEL MANAGER."
ttIt's half-open.  Inside, CHARLIE SIMPSON,
tta heavy man in a shiny suit,
ttis throwing darts in the general direction of a
ttdartboard.  He's not very good.  Frank knocks.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttFrankie.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou wanted to see me, Charlie?

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah, come on in.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttLittle slow tonight.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(waving it off)
ttMondays.

tCharlie takes an envelope from his desk and hands it
tto Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat's this?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYour pay.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNow?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttTake it now.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(confused)
ttWhat about tomorrow?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWe don't need you, Frankie.

tFor a moment, Frank just stands there.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI've got the grands for two nights,
ttCharlie.  You can't just --

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt's all there.  Both nights.

tFrank looks at the envelope in his hands.


<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat're you saying, Charlie?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttLook, Frankie.  You and Jack been
ttplaying here, a long time.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttTwelve years.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttRight, twelve years.  Couple times
tta month.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttSo?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttSo maybe it's time we took a vacation from
tteach other.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttVacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night.
ttYou said so yourself.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie.
ttI got six waiters standing in back listening
ttto baseball.  I gotta move the liquor.  
ttTo move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables.  
ttIt's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you.
ttI love both you guys, you know that.  
ttYou're class.  But people today.  
ttThey don't know class if it walks up and
ttgrabs 'em by the balls.


<b>tINT.  HOTEL LOBBY
</b>
tJack rises as Frank passes through the lobby with
tthe cardboard stand-up.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat's with Charlie?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNothing.  Everything's great.
ttTerrific.


<b>tINT.  FRANK'S HOUSE
</b>
tWith the stand-up under his arm,
tFrank enters and closes the door quietly.  
tA light is glowing in the kitchen.  
tThe rest of the house is dark, quiet.  In the kitchen,
the checks the message pad by the phone.  Nothing.  
tOn the table, a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him.
tNext to it is a stack of bills with a note attached:
t"Frank. Please."
tFrank sighs and leans the stand-up against the wall.  
tThe photo of Jack is peeling off the cardboard.  
tFinding a stack of glossies in a drawer,
tFrank removes the old Jack from the stand-up and
treplaces it with a new one.  
tAs he presses the photograph in place,
this eyes drift to the one of himself.  
tIt was taken a long time ago.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT
</b>
tJack places a record on the turntable and sits at the
tpiano by the window.  As the needle hits the spinning
tdisc, a sharp, snappy BASS LINE REVERBERATES throughout
tthe apartment.  Jack takes a drink, then joins in with
tthe record, playing along.  His concentration is intense,
tso much so that, a moment later, when the PHONE RINGS,
the seems not to hear it.  Finally, he picks it up.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttFRANK (V.0.)
</b>ttIt's me.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFrank?

<b>ttttFRANK (V.0.)
</b>ttYeah.  Listen ... come out to the
tthouse tomorrow, will ya?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI've had enough family for one
ttmonth, Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK (V.0.)
</b>ttIt's not family.  It's business.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSo talk to me tomorrow.  After
ttthe gig.

<b>ttttFRANK (V.0.)
</b>ttWe don't get a gig.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat're you talking about?

<b>ttttFRANK (V.0.)
</b>ttSomething came up.  Don't worry,
ttCharlie stayed true.  Both nights.
ttI'll give you your share tomorrow.
ttAt the house.

tSilence.

<b>ttttFRANK (V.0)
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSo you'll come out, right?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah, okay.

tJack listens to the PHONE HISSING in the dark,
tthen the CONNECTION goes DEAD.


<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>
tA taxi lets Jack off on a street of shabby tract houses.  
tIn his rumpled city suit, Jack looks like a cheap
tgangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers.  
tHe walks up to the door of a small white house and
tpresses the doorbell.
tWhen there is no response, he goes around to the back.

<b>tEXT. BACKYARD
</b>
tThe backyard is small, with a short chainlink fence
tsurrounding it.  Two kids, a girl and a boy,
tare splashing around in a build-it-yourself
tabove-ground pool.  
tWhen they see Jack, they stop splashing.
tOnly their heads are visible above the water.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHey, kids.  Dad home?

tThe two heads say nothing.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhat d'ya say?  Wanna run and get
tthim for me?

tStill nothing.  Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette,
tand pats his pocket for a match.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttShit.

tThe kids' eyes widen at his profanity.  
tJack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip,
tponders things for a moment,
tthen flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence.
tAt which point,
tthe tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey, kid.  Take it easy.

tNo use.  The kid's a world-class screamer.  
tFrank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed,
tcomes racing out of the house.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttCindy!  What is it?

tCindy points.  At Jack.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttJack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYour doorbell doesn't work.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHoney, it's only Uncle Jack.  You
ttremember Uncle Jack.

tDONNA, Frank's wife, appears.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttWhat's the matter?  Jack?

tJack waves.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(lifting Cindy out of the pool)
ttNothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttI'll take her inside.  You too,
ttlittle Frank.  Out of the pool.

tDonna shepherds the kids toward the house.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttFeet!

tThe kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat
tand disappear into the house.  Frank turns to Jack.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIt's probably the excitement of
ttseeing you again.


<b>tEXT.  BACKYARD (LATER)
</b>
tDonna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade.
tThe men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed
taluminum chairs.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWell, look at this.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttYou bring trunks, Jack?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttTrunks?

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttSwimming trunks.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOh. No. Strictly dryland.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttToo bad.  You could use some sun.
ttReally.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttMaybe next time.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttWe have some lotion.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttJust the same.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttSuit yourself.

tDonna returns to the house.
tFrank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his
tsurroundings complacently.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNice, huh?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThe trees.  The flowers.  Nice.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttTerrific.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(expansively)
ttYeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring.
ttAfter the rains.  Look good as new.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou ask me out here to sell me
ttyour house, Frank?

tFrank shakes the ice in his glass.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttCharlie paid you off last night,
ttdidn't he?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI don't know what you mean.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThe hell you don't.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI told you.  Something came up.
ttSome political dinner or something.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank.
ttNo one paid us off.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt wasn't like that.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat was it like?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHey pal, I got a mortgage, all right?  
ttI got two kids. I got a wife.
ttBesides, he made the deal.  
ttThere's no shame in it.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThat how you see it?


<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah, that's how I see it.

tJack shakes his head in disgust.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAnd don't go shaking your head, little brother.
ttI'm not the one who walks in every night smelling
ttlike he's got a day job in a piss factory.
ttt(pause)
ttIt killed him, you know.

tJack glances up.  Dangerous territory.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttA gust of wind killed him.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah, and what put him up there?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHey, you weren't there.  Right?

tJack's look ends this.  Frank sighs.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttLook, can we forget last night?
ttWe gotta talk.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttTalk.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI been thinking maybe we should
ttmake some changes.
ttt(pause)
ttI been thinking maybe we should
tttake on a singer.

tSilence.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSure, why not.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt's just an idea.  I want your opinion.
ttI mean, we go halfway on everything, right?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt's more like 40-60, wouldn't
ttyou say?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe agreed that if I took care of the business;
ttI'd be entitled to the extra.
ttIsn't that what we agreed?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThat's what we agreed.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIf you're unhappy with the
ttarrangement --

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'm not unhappy.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIf you'd like to assume more of the financial
ttresponsibilities, I'd be glad --

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFrank.  Fuck it.  Okay?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI've tried to do well by you, Jack.
ttBy both of us.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'm grateful, Frank.  How much?
ttFor the singer.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI thought maybe twenty percent.
ttLook, with the additional bookings we'll
ttcome out ahead.  The big hotels,
ttthey want a pretty girl with a big voice.
ttWe have to stay competitive, Jack.

tJack laughs coldly.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou, Frank.  All these years you been telling me
ttwe're different.  We got novelty, Jack.
ttNo one can touch us.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttTwo pianos isn't enough anymore,
ttJack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt never was.


<b>tYOUNG WOMAN
</b>
tin pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the
tcenter of a tiny room in the back of Willie's piano
tshowroom, holding some sheet music.  Sammy Davis Jr.'s
tface is on the sheet music.  Frank is sitting against
tthe opposite wall, a notepad in his hand.  
tJack is at the piano.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttGood morning, Miss...?

<b>ttttYOUNG WOMAN
</b>ttMoran.  Monica Moran.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttAll right, Miss Moran

<b>ttttMONICA (YOUNG WOMAN)
</b>ttActually, that's my stage name.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI'm sorry?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttMoran.  Monica.  The whole thing.  
ttIt's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttBlanche.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttNo romance, right?  That's why I came up with
ttMonica. It's what I prefer.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWell, that's fine --

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttBut if you call my house and my mother answers,
ttask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll
ttthink you have the wrong number and hang up.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttAnd if she asks what it's about, don't tell her.
ttShe's opposed to my career.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what
ttis it you'd like to do for us?

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttCandy Man.'
ttt(worried)
ttIs that all right?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt's one of Jack's favorites.

tMonica turns and, seeing Jack at the piano,
tgives a little start.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttOops.  I almost forgot you were
ttthere.  Here's the music.

tMonica begins to hand Jack the sheet music.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh... he knows it.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttReally?  Isn't that a coincidence.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSmall world.

tMonica smiles.  She likes Jack.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWell, shall we?

tProbably not, but Jack begins to play anyway,
tlaconically picking out the cheery tune while Monica
tswings her arms and taps her foot. Despite all this,
tMonica still manages to come in between beats and Jack
thas to scramble over a chord to catch her,
tsort of like a fireman with a net.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttWho can take a sunrise
ttSprinkle it with dew
ttToss it in the air and
ttMake a groovy lemon pie
ttThe Candy Man can
ttThe Candy Man can...,

tThere would appear to be ample evidence as to why the
tmother of Monica nee Blanche opposes her
tdaughter's career.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.

tMonicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up.
tFrank looks over at Jack.  
tJack shrugs and continues to play.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttMiss Moran ... Miss Moran ...
ttBlanche!

tMonica's eyes pop open.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttOh, sorry.  I get so caught up in
ttit sometimes.  It's scary.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYes, it is.

<b>ttttMONICA
</b>ttWell ... thanks.
ttt(to Jack)
ttBye.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttDrive carefully.

tAs Monica exits, Jack and Frank glance at one another
tand thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring
tsingers who can't sing.  As Frank sinks lower in his
tchair and Jack's ashtray spills over with wounded
tcigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes,
tand colors, come forth to offer their own unique
tinterpretations of "Feelings," "I Gotta Be Me,"
t"This Is My Song," and perhaps most appropriately,
t"What Kind of Fool Am I."
tFinally, when it is all over,
tJack and Frank are left alone in the tiny room,
tlooking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal.


<b>tTALL YOUNG WOMAN
</b>
tAs the sequence ends, a TALL YOUNG WOMAN in high heels
twalks into Willie's.  She glances around,
tthen spots Willie across the room,
teating a corn beef on rye.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttHey.  You one of the fabulous
ttBaker Boys?


<b>tJACK AND FRANK
</b>
tare putting on their coats, preparing to leave.
tFrank is staring at his notepad.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThirty-seven girls.
ttAnd not one who can carry a tune.
ttThat must be statistically impossible.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt was a somewhat extraordinary

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI just don't understand.  You

<b>ttttWOMAN (O.S.)
</b>ttDamn!

tThe Woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway,
tholding a shoe in her hand.  It's broken.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttBrand new Thursday.  You believe
ttit?

tAfter today, Jack and Frank are prepared
tto believe anything.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThis where the auditions are?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThis is where the auditions were.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe're finished.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttWhat about me?

tFrank looks at his watch.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou're an hour and a half late.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttMy watch is broken, too.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttPunctuality.  First rule of show
ttbusiness.

tThe Woman looks around her.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttThis is show business?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(in no mood)
ttLook, miss.  We're tired,
ttyou have gum on your lip, and we're going home.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(touching her lip)
ttJust like that, huh?  You're not
tteven gonna give me a chance?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttDon't take it personally.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttHow should I take it?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttImpersonally.

tFrank begins to leave.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttI don't believe it.  I come all the way down down
tthere, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me
tta chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a
ttfew minutes late.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou're an hour and a half late.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttSo if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe ran long.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttSo run a little longer.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttMiss --

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttYou find a girl?

tJack and Frank glance at each other.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttSo. I'm here, you're here, the
ttpiano's here.  What d'ya say?

tBefore Frank can answer, Jack walks over to the piano.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttTerrific.  Thirty-eight.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttWhat's that mean?  Thirty-eight.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttDon't worry about it.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(to Frank)
ttYou know, I'm feeling a lot of
tthostility from you.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(appealing)
ttJack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttLet's get it over with.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttAll right.  What's your name?

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttSusie.  Susie Diamond.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttCatchy.  You have any previous entertainment
ttexperience, Miss Diamond?

<b>ttttSUSIE (WOMAN)
</b>ttWell ... for the last four years
ttI've been on call to Triple A
ttEscort service.

tJack and Frank exchange a glance.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner
ttand dance.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOkay.  I think that's all we
ttneed to know.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI sing now?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThat's the premise.

tSusie gives Frank a dark look, then turns to Jack.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI Get Along Without You.' Slowly,
ttokay?

tJack nods and begins to play.  
tFrank slouches down in his chair,
tpreparing to be tortured again.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing; singing)
ttI get along without you very well
ttOf course I do
ttExcept when soft rains fall
ttAnd drip from leaves, then I recall
ttThe thrill of being
ttSheltered in your arms
ttOf course I do
ttBut I get along without you very well.'

tSusie stops.  Frank just sits there.  
tJack just sits there.  She can sing.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSo?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(blinking)
ttUh ... we'll let you know.

tJack looks over at Frank like he's insane.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhen?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhen we know.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttDon't leave a girl hanging.
ttSecond rule of show business.

tFrank's not amused.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYeah, well, okay.  'Bye, Bakers.

tSusie walks out barefoot.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat are you, crazy?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI just thought we should talk
ttabout it.  Between ourselves.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat's there to talk about?  She can sing.  
ttThat puts her at the head of the class.
ttThat makes her the only one in the class.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI don't know ... She had gum on her lip,
ttfor Christ sake.  
ttI don't think she's right for the act.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(studying him)
ttYou're getting cold feet about
ttthis.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI was just thinking what Ma would
ttthink.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttMa? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the
ttAmbassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass.
ttHow could I forget.

tFrank frowns and looks down at his hands.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHow many other silent partners are there, Frank?
ttDonna?  Little Cindy?  
ttHell, let's give Eddie a vote.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOkay, okay.  I'll call the girl.

tFrank gets up wearily, then glances down at the notepad.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat's the matter?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI didn't get her number.


<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>
tJack and Frank dash out of Willie's and glance up
tand down the street.  Nothing.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe can always look her up in the
ttbook.

<b>ttJACK.
</b>ttRight.  Susie Diamond.  She's probably listed right
ttnext to Monica Moran.

tJack shakes his head in disgust.

<b>ttttWOMAN (O.S.)
</b>ttDoes this mean I get the job?

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tJack and Frank whirl around.

tThere, standing in the doorway, is Susie.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttIntuition.


<b>tCITY SKYLINE
</b>
tGleaming beautifully at the start of a new day.  
tOnce again, "JINGLE BELLS" is heard,
tonly this time carried a little further:
t"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way..."


<b>tJACK, FRANK AND SUSIE
</b>
tEnsconsed in the back room of Willie's, preparing
tfor their first rehearsal ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttReady?

tJack nods.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttReady?

tSusie nods.  Frank poises his hands over the piano,
thesitates, then looks at Jack again.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttReady?

tJack squints at Frank, then nods.  
tFrank turns to Susie.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttReady?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(looking around)
ttWhat are we, an orchestra all of
tta sudden?

tFrank g1ares at her.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSorry.


tFrank poises his hands over the piano again and
tbegins to play the opening passage of
t"Just the Way You Are." A moment later, Jack joins in,
tand a moment after that, Susie.  Unfortunately,
tJack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone,
tare a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a
tfifth grade recital.
tAfter a few bars, Susie holds up her hand.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttFellas, fellas ...

tJack and Frank stop.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat's the problem?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttThe problem is I can't hear myself
ttsing with all this...
ttt(searching)
tt... music.  You know what I'm saying?

tJack and Frank look at one another.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI mean, back there it may be hard to notice,
ttbut up here I'm having a little trouble
ttgetting a word in.

tJack and Frank just stare.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI mean, you're supposed to be
ttbacking me up, right?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(icily)
ttNo. We are not supposed to be
ttbacking you up.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhat I mean is --

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe're a team.  We work together.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttSo work with me, not against me.
ttOkay?

tFrank stares at Susie for a long moment.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI suppose we can bring it down a
ttlittle.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'll drop the eighths.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOkay?

tSusie looks at the two brothers.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOkay.


<b>tWILLIE'S SHOWROOM - LATER
</b>
tFrank is on Willie's telephone.  
tIn the front of the store, just out of earshot,
tJack sits at a beat-up grand,
twhile Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI'm telling you, Ray.  She's got
tta voice like an angel ... What?

tFrank glances furtively across the room to where Susie,
tmaking a very sexy silhouette against the front window,
tis running her hand over a pearl-white piano.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttNo, I wouldn't say she's got a
ttbody like an angel.

tAs Frank continues to talk in the background,
tSusie looks over at Jack.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHey, he's not sore, is he?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe'll come around.

tSusie nods, goes back to stroking the piano.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou never sang before?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttNot for money. With my mother.

tJack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttShe used to waitress downtown, nights,
ttwhen I was a kid.  On the way home, we'd sing.
ttYou know how people whistle when they're nervous?
ttMy mother sang.  She always said you're never alone
ttwith a song 'cause thousands of people know the
ttsame song and even though you can't hear 'em,
ttthey're singing with you.  I don't know.  
ttIf they were, they were all singing safe inside
tttheir apartments.
ttt(shrugging)
ttBut it worked.  We always got home.  Ever since,
ttI always wanted to sing.  
ttI never took lessons or anything, though.
ttI guess you guys took a lot of lessons.

tJack looks down at the piano in front of him.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah.  We took a lot of lessons.


<b>tJACK AND NINA
</b>
tJack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets
tready for the night's gig.  Nina, standing next to him
tat the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar
tof shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttYou shave like an old movie, Jack.

tAs Jack picks up a razor, Nina takes the brush and begins
tto soap her face in the mirror.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIn the old days, every man had a shaving mug that
tthe kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he
ttwanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop
ttand there would be his mug, waiting for him.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttIs that what you used to do?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttMy days are not the old days,
ttgenius.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttWhat are they?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThe recent past.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttOh.
ttt(nodding to the ceiling)
ttBigfoot gets his out of a can.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHow do you know?

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttI saw his stuff in the bathroom.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOh?

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttI guess it's getting serious.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttMaybe he'll ask your ma to marry
tthim.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttI hope not.  He's already busted the springs
ttin two chairs.  Hey, what's this?

tNina holds up the handle of the shaving brush.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIvory.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttLooks old.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOlder than me.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttWow.

tJack gives Nina a look, then begins to splash his face.
tNina picks up the razor.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHey, what do you want to do?  Grow
tta beard?

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttWhy not?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWell, let's get your first prom
ttunder the belt, okay?

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttWhat's a prom?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttEver go to church?

tNina nods.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt's like that.  Only you gotta
ttdance.


<b>tINT.  HOTEL
</b>
tAs Jack enters the hotel, he passes by the cardboard
tstand-up, prominently displayed in the lobby.  
tIt is virtually unchanged, except for a small notation
tat the bottom: "With Guest Vocalist."
tOn the other side of the lobby,
tFrank is pacing nervously.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhere the hell is she?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt's early.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI told everyone seven-fifteen.
ttDidn't I? Seven-fifteen.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttShe'll get here.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJust like the day of the auditions,
ttright?  Jesus.  How's my hair?


<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttAwe inspiring.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah, well, Your's isn't.
ttt(taking out a comb)
ttLet me run a comb though it.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttGet out of here.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttCome on, stand still.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttGet out of here!

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt's not gonna hurt you.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.

tFrank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to
tfeint an opponent, then takes a flick at Jack's hair.
tJack hits him.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(holding his shoulder)
ttYou hit me.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI told you I was gonna hit you.

tHe looks capable of hitting him again, too.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttAll right, all right.  I'm a little
tttense.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou're a fucking alarm clock.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI just wish she'd get here, that's
ttall.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttShe's here.

tSusie, wearing a flamboyant orange dress,
tis standing across the lobby, staring at the stand-up.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttChrist, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna
ttwear her street clothes she'd have enough sense
ttto come in the back.
ttt(walking over)
ttGood evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhere's my name?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat-?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttAnd how come you guys are the only ones with
ttyour pictures on the poster?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe'll talk about it later.  Right
ttnow, you gotta get changed.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttChanged?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhere's your dress?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(to Jack)
ttWhat's he talking about?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIs there a language problem here?  Your dress.
ttFor tonight.  Where is it?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttDo I look like I'm naked?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThat!  You can't wear that!

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhat's wrong with it?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt's orange!

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(to Jack)
ttAm I missing something?

tBefore Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie's hand and
tpulls her toward the door.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttCome on.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHey!

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttCome on.  We don't have much time.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttTime for what?


<b>tINT.  DEPARTMENT STORE
</b>
tFrank, Jack and Susie dash through a cavernous
tdowntown department store, the brothers turning a few
theads with their tuxedoes.  As they reach the ladies'
tdepartment, Frank begins to flip through the
tdress racks.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttIf you ask me, this is pretty
ttstupid.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJust look.  What do you wear?
ttA nine?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(offended)
ttA seven.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttMy wife wears a seven.  You don't
ttlook like a seven to me.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI wear a seven.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOkay, okay.  Here, how about this?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(looking)
ttSave it for your wife.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe're not exactly silly with time,
ttyou know.  Jack, you find anything?

tJack, somewhat out of his element, is looking at belts.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHere, how's this?

tFrank holds out an inky black dress.  Susie gives it
ta long look.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttClose enough.  Let's go.

tFrank begins to drag Susie into the dressing room.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I
ttcome from there's a little girl's room and a
ttlittle boy's room and the little boys don't go
ttwhere the little girls go.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttAll right, but make it quick.
ttt(remembering)
ttShoes!  What size do you wear?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(from the dressing room)
ttNine.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNine?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttNine!

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(to himself)
ttBig feet.


<b>tINT.  SHOE DEPARTMENT
</b>
tFrank and Jack work the shoe department,
tscouting the endless rows.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttSee anything?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(holding one up)
ttHow about these?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJack, for crying out loud.  Your
ttbachelorhood's showing.
ttt(seeing something)
ttAh, here we go.

tFrank grabs a pretty blue pump and gestures to the
tSALESMAN, who's waiting on a woman.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHey!  Do these come in black?

<b>ttttSALESMAN
</b>ttI'll be with you in a minute, sir.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI don't have a minute, pal.  Yes
ttor no?

<b>ttttSALESMAN
</b>ttt(glowering)
ttYes.  They come in black.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOkay.  Give me a pair of nines.
ttPronto.

tThe Salesman looks casually at Jack.

<b>ttttSALESMAN
</b>ttDoes he want a pair, too?


<b>tINT.  DRESS DEPARTMENT
</b>
tAs Jack and Frank return to the dress department,
tFrank jettisons the shoebox and tissue paper.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttAll right, we got your shoes.

tJust then, Susie steps out of the dressing room.
tEven Frank stops at the sight of her.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhat do you think?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh... good.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(turning to Jack)
ttZip me up?

tThe dress is open down to the small of her back.
tIt's a nice back.
tJack takes the zipper and closes the panels carefully.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttShoes?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttRight.

tFrank puts the shoes down and Susie steps into them.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttThey're tight.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThey're nines.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWell, they're aspiring to be
ttsevens.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou can buy new ones tomorrow.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOh, thanks.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttDon't worry.  We'll take it out
ttof your share.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYou're a prince.


<b>tINT.  HOTEL
</b>
tAs the trio rushes into the hotel service entrance,
tRAY, the assistant manager, appears.

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttYou better buy yourself a watch,
ttFrankie.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe had a little emergency.

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttYeah, well, I've got a little emergency.
ttYou know what I'm saying?
ttt(seeing Susie)
ttWho's this, Minnie Pearl?

tAll eyes turn to Susie's dress, which still has the
ttags attached.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(moving off)
ttJesus.

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttI want seventy-five minutes, Frankie.
ttYou hear me?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThis is going well, isn't it?


<b>tINT.  KITCHEN
</b>
tThe three rush into the kitchen.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe need scissors over here!
ttWho's got scissors?
ttt(turning to Susie)
ttOkay, remember.  Jack and I go on first,
ttI do the set-up, then introduce you.
ttAnd you say ...

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(deadpan)
ttGood evening, ladies and gentlemen.  
ttI can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.  
ttIt's like a dream come true.
ttAnd speaking of dreams ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttPiece of cake.

tA tiny MAN in an apron walks up with a meat cleaver.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttCarlos, that's,a cleaver.  I need
ttscissors.

<b>ttttCARLOS (MAN)
</b>ttNo scissors.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJesus Christ.  All right.  Let's
ttgo, Jack.  Fix your tie.

tJack and Frank exit.  
tSusie stares a little warily at Carlos and his cleaver.

<b>tINT.  LOUNGE
</b>
tJack and Frank slide quickly behind their pianos.  
tAbout half the tables in the room are filled.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttGood evening, ladies and gentlemen.  
ttWelcome to the Ambassador Lounge.  
ttMy name's Frank Baker and no, you're not
ttseeing double, it's just my
ttlittle brother, Jack.

tSome laughter.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI'm glad you're all in such a good mood tonight,
ttbecause we've got a very special
ttevening planned ...


<b>tINT.  KITCHEN
</b>
tSusie sits on a stool while Carlos positions the dress tags
ton a cutting board.  As a WAITRESS from the bar passes by,
tSusie snares a drink from her tray.

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>ttHey!

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttJust a sip.  To kill the
ttbutterflies, okay?

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>ttOkay.  But no lipstick.

tSusie takes a quick sip.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttThere.  No one's the wiser.

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>ttNice dress.

tAs the Waitress exits, Carlos brings the cleaver down
twith a sharp chop, severing the tags.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttAppreciate it, Ace.


<b>tLOUNGE
</b>
tThe audience is laughing.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttBut seriously, folks, as I sit here tonight,
ttlooking out on all your kind faces, I can't help
ttbut feel some of us have met before.  We may not
ttknow each other's names, we might not recognize
ttone another on the street, but we know each other
ttjust the same.  And over the years we've shared
ttsomething.  A little music, a little drink,
tta little laughter, maybe even... a few tears.  
ttBut I guess that's what friends are for, huh?

tApplause.  Jack puts out his cigarette.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOh, brother.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttAnd it's especially nice to be among friends
tttonight, because, well, tonight's a very special
ttnight for my brother and I. This evening we've
ttasked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I
ttare sure will soon seem like just another old
ttfriend to you all.  She's making her debut here
ttthis evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she
ttcouldn't be doing it in a better place.
ttBecause there's one place that's always been for
ttus a very special place, and that place is this
ttplace, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen,
ttplease welcome a very special lady with a very
ttspecial way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.

tApplause.  Susie strides out of the kitchen, past the
tbusing station, and up to the microphone stand, which,
tunfortunately, is not on.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing; whispering)
ttThe switch.  Hit the switch.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttSwitch?
ttt(as she hits it)
ttWhat fucking switch?

tSilence.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing; very demure)
ttPardon me.

tJack and Frank look at one another, then, before
toutrage can set in, plunge into the opening number.  
tSusie takes the mike from the stand and smiles sweetly.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI can't tell you how thrilled I
ttam to be here.

tFor the moment, the audience doesn't seem quite sure
thow thrilled they are to be here.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI'm all smiles, darling
ttThrough and through...'


<b>tINT.  LOBBY
</b>
tA BELLBOY exits the elevator and, hearing Susie's voice
tcoming from the lounge, stops.  
tHe looks to the CLERK behind the front desk.

<b>ttttBELLBOY
</b>ttI thought the Bakers were on
tttonight.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttThey are.

<b>ttttBELLBOY
</b>ttWell, who's that?

tThe Clerk looks up from the register and listens.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttI don't know.  Frank?


<b>tINT.  LOUNGE
</b>
tJudging from the faces, Susie's as big a hit in the
tlounge as she is in the lobby.  Head thrown back, eyes
tclosed, she sings with abandon, finishing on a long
textended note, then swooping down in a dramatic,
texhausted bow.  There is a split second of silence,
tthen thunderous applause.  Magic.


<b>tEXT.  HOTEL
</b>
tThe new trio, fresh off their first gig,
tcome out of the service entrance into the night.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttFucking.  She says fucking in
ttfront of an entire room of people.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI said I was sorry.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(to Jack)
ttDid you hear it?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFucking.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttLook, they were all on their third Mai Tais
ttby the time I got out there anyway.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(directly to her)
ttFucking.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttFor Christ sake, I said it, I
ttdidn't do it.
ttt(pulling out some bills)
ttBesides, I don't think they were
tttoo offended, do you?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(grabbing the bills)
ttGive me that.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHey!

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe are not a saloon act.  We do
ttnot take tips from dirty old men.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(innocent)
ttI was gonna split it with you guys.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe do not take tips.  I'll apply
ttthis to the cost of the dress.

tFrank puts the money in his pocket.  Susie stares at
thim, steaming.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttThen I want my name on the poster.
ttAnd my picture!
ttt(taking off her shoes)
ttAnd these shoes are too goddamn tight!

tSusie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot.
tJack is leaning against the wall,
twatching it all with amusement.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNice girl.

tON Frank's expression we hear the OPENING NOTES of
t"New York, New York" and we see:


<b>tSERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
tSusie and the boys performing it in one lounge after
tanother, playing to increasingly enthusiastic audiences,
tno empty tables now.

tAs the SONG ends, we CLOSE ON the cardboard stand-up,
tnewly done over with a picture of Susie and an
taccompanying exclamation: "See the Sensational Susie
tDiamond!" As the FINAL CHORD sounds we --

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>

<b>tINT.  LLOYD'S OFFICE
</b>
tJack and Frank, once again in the office of the
tsupercilious Lloyd, waiting as he prepares their
tcash envelope.

<b>ttttLLOYD
</b>ttYes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched
ttonto.  She a local?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttBorn and bred.

<b>ttttLLOYD
</b>ttLucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys.  
ttDon't spend it all in one place.  
ttOh ... you want to count it, Jack?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe trust you, Lloyd.  You know
ttthat.

tFrank takes the envelope and begins to leave.

<b>ttttLLOYD
</b>ttSay, Frankie.  Since I've got you here...
ttHow's next week look for you guys?

tFrank glances at Jack, giving it to him.  
tJack's eyes go cold.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWe'll call you.

tAs Lloyd's face drops, Jack and Frank step into the
thallway and begin to walk slowly away, playing it cool,
tthen glance at one another and begin to walk faster
tbecause they're about to burst out laughing.



<b>tFOLLOWING SHOT
</b>
tBy the time they reach the lobby, they are laughing,
ttripping across the carpet, out the front entrance and
tonto the sidewalk, where their voices explode in the
tnight air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz
ttogether, laughing giddily, until they see - standing
tunder an awning, lighting a cigarette - Susie, watching
tthem with raised eyebrows.  Jack and Frank, frozen in a
tclumsy embrace, quickly disengage and begin clearing
ttheir throats and squaring their cuffs.  Susie exhales
ta plume of smoke, studies them a moment,
tthen smiles slightly.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttNight, Bakers.

tAs she turns away, Jack glances up, watching her
ttrim shadow disappear down the street.


<b>tEXT.  CITY
</b>
tGray and cold.  The streets swept with rain.  
tAnd once again the tentative piano:
t"JINGLE BELLS, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  
tOh what fun it is to ride ...
tOh what fun it is to ride ... Oh what fun..."


<b>tINT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

tJack and Eddie are sitting in the waiting room:
tsmall and dirty and packed with pet owners and
ttheir animals.
tAfter a moment, a WOMAN with a clipboard appears.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttBarker.
ttt(no takers)
ttJock Barker?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(realizing it's him)
ttBaker.  Jack Baker.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttRight.  Bring him back.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttCome on, Ed.

tJack and Eddie follow the Woman down a corridor.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttYou should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker.
ttThe doctor doesn't like to be bitten.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe doesn't bite.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttThey never do, Mr. Barker.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBaker.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttRight.  In there.

tThe Woman points Jack and Eddie into a small room.
tThere is an examining table, a sink, and on the wall,
ta chart detailing the various breeds of dogs and cats.
tJack glances around the room, then comes back to Eddie,
twho's staring up at him.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou shoulda brushed, pal.

tJust then, a MAN in a white coat breezes in.

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY (MAN)
</b>ttAh, labradorus retreiverus.  Good fellows.  
ttQuiet, but able to appreciate a good joke.

tDr. Beasley pats Eddie on the side, then turns to Jack.

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttBeasley.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBaker.

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttWhat's our friend's problem?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttTeeth.

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttWhat's wrong with them?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThey're falling out.

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttUh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's
ttget him up here.

tJack lifts Eddie up onto the table and Dr. Beasley opens
tEddie's mouth for a look.  It doesn't take long.

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttThey gotta go.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(a take)
ttHow many?

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttFive's my guess.  Maybe more.
ttWon't know till I get in there.
ttt(consulting his clipboard)
ttLeave him now and you can pick
tthim up in the morning.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIsn't there something you can
ttgive him?  A pill or something?

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttDecay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to
ttthe denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest.
ttThen the heart goes. We wouldn't want that,
ttwould we?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHow will he eat?

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttStart him out on cottage cheese.  
ttIf you've got him on kibble, just soak it a
ttfew minutes.  Go down like pudding
ttthrough a hot pipe.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo bones?

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttNo bones.

tJack looks at Eddie.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat do you do to him?

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttDon't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out.
ttHe won't feel a thing.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI think maybe I'll bring him back
ttnext week ...

<b>ttttDR. BEASLEY
</b>ttThe sooner we do this the better,
ttMr. Baker.


<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>
tJack steps out onto the rainy street alone.
tHe glances back at the vet's with second thought,
tthen moves slowly off.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT
</b>
tJack enters with a small grocery bag and opens the
trefrigerator.  A carton of cream, a few eggs --
tthere's not much there.  He takes a small container of
tcottage cheese from the grocery bag and places it on an
tempty shelf.  As he closes the refrigerator door, he
tglances around the apartment.  It is very still, very
tquiet.  He looks up at the ceiling absently, then walks
tover to the window and looks out.  There is a mug of
tcoffee there on the sill.  He takes it and holds it in
tboth hands for a moment, then places it back on the sill.
tHe sits at the piano and runs his fingers lightly over
tthe ivory, not making a sound, then places his hands on
tthe keys and begins to play.  "Jingle Bells."


<b>tINT.  CORNER DINER
</b>
tIn the front window, room has been made among the
tphotographs for one of Susie.  Inside, Jack, Frank
tand Susie sit at a table, surrounded by empty coffee
tcups and cigarettes.  Frank has several slips of paper
tbefore him with names and dates.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThe twenty-third ... Yeah, here it is. We got the
ttCarlton or the Plaza.  Four day turns.
ttWhat do you think, Jack?

tJack is staring out the window.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttJack, you with us?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttThe Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum.
ttAnd they water their drinks.
ttIt's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.

tSusie, as she says this, is pouring sugar into her Coke.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(watching)
ttI guess it's,the Plaza then.  
ttThat brings us to the twenty-seventh.  
ttWe got the Avedon for three or the Park
ttdowntown for two.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWe take the Avedon, right?  Simple.

tFrank rubs his chin and looks at Jack.  Jack shakes
this head.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThe Park?  It's only two nights.
ttWhy throw away a night?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBecause Blackie Carson books the Park and
ttwhenever we've needed a gig he's come through.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOh.
ttt(lifting her glass)
ttWell, for Blackie then.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttBy the way, I got a messsage
ttyesterday from some guy looking for
ttNew Year's action.  Resort, upstate.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(likes "resort')
ttHey.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSounds like a booking agent
ttlooking to book an easy fee.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThat's what I figure.  Probably have us in
tta bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttMaybe it's legit.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttMaybe.  I'll call him.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttMake it collect.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(shuffling his slips)
ttThat's it except for the first.
ttWe got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the
ttHoliday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.

tFrank looks at Jack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttDraw.

tSusie shrugs.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHow'd you guys used to decide what
ttgig to take?

tJack and Frank exchange a glance.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh, well ... we flipped a coin.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttSo find a dime.  Let's get out
ttof here.


<b>tEXT.  DINER
</b>
tJack and Frank step out-of the diner and turn their
tcollars up against the chill.  
tFrank pulls on a pair of gloves.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJesus, it's gonna be mean this year.  
ttWhere're your gloves?

tJack shrugs.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttBetter take care of your fingers, little brother.  
ttBuy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't
ttbe able to play 'Chopsticks.'

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'll take my chances.

tFrank pats his hands together and glances into the street.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttSomething, huh?  All those bids.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah.  Something.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah ... Well, I gotta go.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou wanna get a drink?

tFrank stops, surprised.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo, I... Little Frank's got strep. Donna's been
ttup two nights making sure the rest of us
ttdon't get it.

tJack nods.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou all right?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah, fine.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOkay I'll see you tomorrow night then.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttRight.

tAs Frank leaves, he takes a glance at his brother,
tthen disappears around the corner.  A second later,
tSusie comes out of the diner.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhere's egghead?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHis kid's sick.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(searching her purse)
ttI don't know.  It's hard figuring you two
ttas brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've
ttscrambled the babies somewhere.


<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe takes after our mother.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be
ttone crazy dame.  Shit.

tJack offers his pack of cigarettes.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttUh-uh.  I never touch American
ttcigarettes.
ttt(still searching)
ttWhat's tomorrow again?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThe Stratford.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttNice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even
ttthe bedspreads.
ttt(shaking the purse)
ttDamn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go
ttthrough 'em like toothpicks.
ttTwelve-and-a-half cents a piece,
ttyou believe that?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttParis Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat
ttdown with a pencil and added it one day.  But
ttI figure, if you're gonna be sticking something
ttin your mouth, you might as well make it the best.
ttt(finding one)
ttAh, here's a lost soul.

tJack lights it.  She takes a draw.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttMmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well,
ttau revoir.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHey.
ttt(as she stops)
ttYou feel like a cup of coffee?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYou kidding?  We must've killed three pots in
ttthere.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou want me to walk you?

tSusie looks at Jack a little funny.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttNo. Thanks.
ttShe starts to move away, then stops and looks back.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are
ttyou? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me
ttand waking up all sweaty and looking at me like
ttI'm some kinda princess when I burp.

<b>ttJACK
</b>ttForget it.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI mean, that'd be too creepy.
ttWith us working together and all.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttForget it.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttNothing personal --

tJack holds up his hand.  Susie just stands there.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBetter hurry.  You're a nickel
ttdown on your cigarette.


<b>tEXT.  VETERINARY CLINIC
</b>
tJack paces outside the veterinary clinic, rubbing his
tarms against the night's chill.  He glances up at the
tflickering sign over the building: "Twenty-Four Hour
tEmergency Care." Inside, a KID with deep-set eyes is
tbent over a magazine.  Jack hesitates then enters.


<b>tINT.  VETERINARY CLINIC
</b>
<b>ttttKID
</b>ttYeah?

tJack glances around, ill at ease.

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou want something, pal?  If you're looking for a
ttbathroom, try the Super Chief around the corner.

tThe Kid goes back to his magazine.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo, I, uh, left a dog here this morning.
ttHe needed some work on his mouth.

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttRegular hours are eight to five.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by.
ttThought I'd check in on him.

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttYou can check in on him tomorrow.  
ttBetween eight and five.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah, well, couldn't I take a
ttlook now?

tThe Kid looks up at Jack with mild contempt.

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttYou want to know if he's okay.
ttRight?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(uncomfortable)
ttYeah.

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttAll right.  Hold on.

</b>ttThe name's Baker --

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(puzzled)
ttBlack.  Labrador.

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttAll right. they lay the dead ones out in the
ttcold room.  I'll take a look.

tThe Kid disappears into the back.  Jack stands frozen,
twatching the swinging door come to rest.  He looks
tlike a man who, unexpectedly, finds a razor pressed
tto his neck.  He fumbles for a cigarette, but doesn't
tlight it.  He waits.  A moment later, the door swings
topen.

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttNope.  Just a couple poodles.

tJack nods, then, moving stiffly, leaves.

</b>
tOn the floor, a long line of bowls, each containing
ta different concoction, all intended for the ailing Eddie.
tEddie, lying a few feet away, shows no interest.  
tIn the kitchen, Jack is heating something up in a pan.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttI tried Cheerios this morning.  
ttHe didn't even get up.
ttMaybe they took out the wrong teeth.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it,
ttpal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.

tJack dumps some brown slop into a bowl and places it next
tto the others.  Nina and he wait.  At first, nothing, then
t... Eddie's eyes move.  His nose twitches.  
tHis head lifts. Finally, he gets up and walks to the
tbowl.  He eats.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttChili.


<b>tCITY
</b>
tdraped in winter.  Dark skies, people lost in heavy
tcoats, the city's battered Christmas decorations hung
ttenuously across traffic-clogged streets.  Over it all
twe hear "JINGLE BELLS," PLAYED for the first time
tcompletely through, hesitantly but without error.
tAs the SONG ENDS, we are:

tAll done up in reds and greens for Christams Eve.
tJack, Frank and Susie -- each decked out in their own
tlittle Santa hats -- perform "Silver Bells" for the

tmistaken for Santa Claus, but Susie looks adorable.
tFrank just looks happy. As they finish,
tthe crowd applauds.

</b>
tJack, now sans Santa hat, enters the bathroom off the
tlobby and finds Santa Claus standing in front of the
tmirror, fussing with his beard.

</b>ttHey, Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou recognized me.

</b>ttJust a lucky guess.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttSo what do you think?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttVery realistic.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(not buying it)
ttYeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had

ttJesus, you remember him being this big?

tJack looks in the mirror.

</b>ttYeah.

</b>ttWell, the line's growing weaker, little brother.
ttLucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.

tJack and Frank step out into the lobby, thus giving
ta few people, Susie among them, the curious privilege
tof seeing Santa Claus exit a men's room.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou want to come out to the house tomorrow?
ttThe way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided
ttto really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the

</b>ttThanks, but I've got plans.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttFor the kids.
ttt(moving off)
ttMerry Christmas, you two.  Don't

tFrank pushes through the revolving door and steps
tout into the street in his Santa suit.

</b>ttHe do that every year?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttEvery year.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttAren't the kids asleep?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttEvery year.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttSo why's he do it?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI guess in case one year they're not.

tJack looks into Susie's eyes, then crosses to the
tdoor and exits.  Susie watches him go, then turns to
tthe desk clerk.

</b>ttCall me a cab, will ya?

</b>
tAs Jack enters his apartment, he senses a presence in
tthe room and looks over to the old phone booth.  
tNina is sitting inside on the little stool, her head
ttilted against the glass.  Jack studies her a moment,
tthen takes the carton of eggnog he's carrying into the
tkitchen and grabs a pair of glasses.  He pulls a chair
tover to the phone booth and sits down.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttHow'd the show go?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOkay.  How'd yours go?

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttNot so good.

tJack looks at Nina's face, tender and young in the
tsoft shadows of the booth.  After a moment, her eyes
tshift to the carton in his hand.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttEggnog?

tJack nods.

</b>ttt(continuing)
ttFrom Hurley's?

</b>ttCan I stay here tonight?  Even if

</b>ttWhat do you think?

tEddie, outfitted in a brand new, spanking red dog
tsweater, stares up at Jack and Nina, wondering why
the's the object of so much attention.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttVery cool.

</b>t(sporting his new sweater)

tmake their way across an empty cemetery.
tNina is swinging a bottle of whiskey.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttt(looking around)
ttThere were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi
ttdown at the drugstore says it's going to snow
ttby New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows.
ttI hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman.
ttYou ever make a snowman, Jack?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSure.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttThat's what I want to do.  
ttI want to make a snowman.

tAs they come to a plot of ground, they stop.  
tThere are two matching headstones, one for Jack's father,
tfully engraved, and another for Jack's mother, bearing
tonly her name.  Jack studies the plot a moment, then
tcrouches before his father's marker: "ANDREW S. BAKER.
tAdoring Husband of Eleanor, Loving Father of Franklin
tand John." Jack brushes some dirt from the face of the
tstone, then stands.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttNow?

tJack nods.  Nina uncaps the whiskey bottle and pours
tit onto the dead man's grave.

<b>ttttNINA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttMerry Christmas, Mr. Baker.

tThey stand another moment, just looking, then turn away.
tAs they begin to walk, Jack sees Eddie in his new
tsweater sniffing at a gravestone.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHey, Eddie.  Have some respect,
ttwill ya?


<b>tEXT.  BUILDING
</b>
tJack is sitting on a suitcase in front of his building.
tA moment later, Frank pulls the car up to the curb and
tJack gets in.  Susie is sitting up front.


<b>tINT.  CAR
</b>
tFrank, burning with the afterglow of a holiday spent
twith family, cheerfully maneuvers the car
tthrough the city.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttSo. How was everyone's Christmas?

tJack and Susie stare disconsolately out the window.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttToo early, huh?  Well, there's coffee and donuts
ttfor whoever wants them.  
ttHow about a maple bar, Jack?

tJack shakes his head and takes out a cigarette.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttUh, Jack ... if you don't mind.

tJack stares at the back of Frank's head,
tthen puts the cigarette away. Susie takes a peek in
tthe donut bag and looks a little sick.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttBy the way, if anyone gets bored,
ttDonna packed some travel games.
ttThey work wonders with the kids.

tFrank reaches under the seat and hands Susie a sack
tfull of magnetic games, puzzles, and plastic cubes.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou two could play checkers.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttMaybe we should just listen to the radio.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttSorry.  It only plays static.

tSusie looks at the radio,
tthen at the games in her hands.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHow long did you say it takes to
ttget to this place?


<b>tINT. CAR - FEW HOURS LATER
</b>
tJack is staring out the window at the winter landscape,
tan unlit cigarette dangling from his lip.  
tSusie is gnawing on a donut, deeply obsessed with an
telaborate plastic puzzle.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttAny more coffee?

tSusie snaps out of her trance and shakes the Thermos.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttUh-uh.  Hey, what's this?

tSusie notices an old, leather-bound ledger.  Inside,
tthere are hundreds of tiny entries.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou play all these places?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttBaker's unabridged.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttJesus, you fellas've made a lot of
ttnoise.  What's with the stars?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttVirgins.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttVirgins?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttFirst times. Hey, look at this.

tA crepe-covered car surrounded by several other
tHONKING VEHICLES passes by.  Jack stares at the beaming
tnewlyweds as they glide past his window,
ttwo kids starting life in a beat-up Eldorado
tcovered with toilet paper.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhen's the last time we played a
ttwedding, Jack?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttTwo years ago.  March.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(consulting the ledger)
ttHe's right.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHe's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.

tSusie looks at Frank curiously.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttGo ahead.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(scanning the book)
ttOkay.The Fantasy Inn.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJack?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(staring out the window)
ttNovember.  '71.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttFirst night?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttDay.  Wednesday.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttLast?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSunday.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI don't believe it.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music.
ttHears it once and he's got it.

ttFrank smiles into the rear view mirror.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttMy brilliant little brother.


<b>tEXT.  HOTEL
</b>
tThe hotel, done in a sort of King Arthur motif,is
tbuilt right on the ocean.  Frank guides the car down
ta simulated cobblestone drive and the three get out.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWill you listen to that ocean?

tIt's LOUD.  Frank takes a deep breath.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAnd how about this air? I'm telling you,
tta few days in this place'll put five years
tton your life.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttSmells like fish.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOf course it smells like fish.  
ttWe're on the ocean.
ttWhat'd you expect, Chanel number five?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(to herself)
ttSmells like tuna number two to me.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt's paradise.  That's what it is.
ttParadise.

tAs Susie and Jack follow Frank up the drive, Jack
tnotices the beat-up Eldorado in the parking lot,
tits toilet paper streamers blowing
tgently in the ocean breeze.


<b>tINT.  HOTEL LOBBY
</b>
tThe lobby is done in royal reds and blues and there
tare a lot of swords on the walls.
tFranks steps up to the front desk.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHi, we're the Fabulous Baker Boys.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttGlad to meet you.  I'm Terrific
ttTom.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo. We're the entertainment.

<b>ttttTOM (CLERK)
</b>ttOh, right, gotcha.  You got bags?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOutside.  Blue Chevy.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(ringing a bell)
ttCyril.  Chevy.  Blue.  Take 'em up
ttto the Guinevere Suite.

tA lanky boy in velvet jodhpurs and high stockings ambles
tout for the bags.  Tom hands Frank the room keys.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttRight on the ocean, Mr. Baker.
ttYou can practically dangle your toes
ttin the water.


<b>tINT.  SUITE
</b>
tTom wasn't kidding.  The immediacy of the ocean beyond
tthe window is almost scary.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou believe this?  I'm telling you, we're getting
ttaway with murder.  Two shows a night and the rest
ttof the time we live like kings.  It's a crime.

tJack stares at the ocean, then at the two beds placed
tside by side.  Suddenly Susie comes through the bathroom.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHey, we're connected.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttGreat.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttGreat?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah.

tSusie shrugs and returns to her room through the
tbathroom.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI thought we had separate rooms.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(opening drawers)
ttWe do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey.
ttWash and Dries.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI thought we all had separate rooms.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttCome on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first
tttime we've bunked together.  It'll be like when
ttwe were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.


<b>tINT.  DINING ROOM
</b>
tJack, Frank and Susie are in the dining room, which,
tlike their rooms, looks out over the ocean.  
tDinner is over and they're well
tthrough a second bottle of wine.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYou're kidding me.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttAs Charlie Steinway is my witness.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttPeggy Lee?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttTell her.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttShe was staying at the Grand
ttdowntown ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt was April.  April seventeenth.
ttThat one I remember.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWe were playing the lounge one
ttnight and she came in.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttPearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFrank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said
ttyes, and we did a few bars.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttA few bars!

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhat'd she sing?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttPeople.' You think Streisand, right?  
ttHot that night.  Chills.  
ttThrough the whole audience.  I could hardly play.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWow. You ever see her again?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo. We got a picture, though.  
ttOne of the waitresses had a camera.
ttt(to Jack)
ttGod, we were just kids.  That was
ttsomething, wasn't it?

tJack nods.  Frank shakes his head, still lost in the
tspring evening years before, then notices the newlyweds
tsitting across the room.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey, will you look at that?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttThey must've bought the same
ttmap we did.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat do you say we send a bottle
ttover?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI don't believe it.  You're a
ttromantic, Frank.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe's drunk.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNot true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOh yeah?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHe's just afraid to show it.
ttAren't you, little brother?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHave some more wine, Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttGood idea.
ttt(lifting his glass)
ttTo Peggy Lee.

</b>
tFrank, standing, dressed in pajamas.
tJack is staring out the window at the darkness.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI'm putting my stuff on the right,
ttokay?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOkay.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI figure that way we won't get confused.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUnless you want the right.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo, you take the right.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe might as well do the towels the same way.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOkay.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI just figure things'll go smoother, you know,
ttif we have it all worked out from the beginning.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttGood idea.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttBut if it doesn't work out, let
ttme know.  I'm,flexible.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttRight.

tFrank nods and moves to the bed.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing; re: the bathroom light)
ttYou leaving that on?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttAll night?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWe're gonna be here a week?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(puzzled)
ttYeah.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSo you're gonna leave it on.
ttEvery night.  For a week.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah.  You mind?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhy would I mind?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid.
ttI figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?

tJack just stares at Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttOh. I didn't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid.
ttIt was never a big deal then.  Was it?

tJack just stares at Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttOh. Well.  You want me to turn
ttit off?

tJack just stares at Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI'll turn it off.

tJack turns back to the window.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttForget it.  It's no big deal.


<b>tINT.  DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe next morning.  Jack and Frank are standing
tin a huge dining room, appraising two elegant grands.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThey're beauties, huh?

tJack steps up to one and runs his hand over the keys.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttReminds me of those Steinways Willie used to have.

tFrank taps a few notes on his piano, humming happily.
tJack begins to echo his brother's notes, listening.
tAfter a moment, Frank notices.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhat?


<b>tINT.  DINING ROOM
</b>
tA short, stubby LITTLE MAN in a charcoal suit strides
tinto the dining room, followed by Terrific Tom.

<b>ttttMR. DANIELS (LITTLE MAN)
</b>ttGood morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels,
ttthe manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you
tton the phone.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(offering his hand)
ttThat'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker.  
ttThis is my brother Jack.

tJack, slouched against the piano, smoking, nods.

<b>ttttMR. DANIELS
</b>ttTom here tells me there's a problem with the
ttpianos.  We were assured they were in tune.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYes, well, they are.

<b>ttttMR. DANIELS
</b>ttThen I'm afraid I don't understand.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThey are in tune.  But not with
tteach other.

<b>ttttMR. DANIELS
</b>ttIs that important?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh, well ...

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYes.  It's important.

tFrank glances nervously at Jack.

<b>ttttMR. DANIELS
</b>ttTom, who're we dealing with on
ttthese?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttA Mr. Reynolds, sir.  But he's gone on vacation.
ttI called this morning.

<b>ttttMR. DANIELS
</b>ttWell, gentlemen, I don't know what to say.  
ttNot being a musician myself I find it difficult
ttto grasp the magnitude of this.  I don't suppose
ttthere's any way you could just ... accommodate.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttAccommodate?  I don't think I know
ttwhat you mean.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say,
ttJack, is --

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhy don't we let Mr. Daniels tell
ttus what he's trying to say.

<b>ttttMR. DANIELS
</b>ttI assure you, Mr. Baker, no offense is intended.
ttI simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we?


<b>tINT.  HALLWAY
</b>
tFrank dogs Jack down a hallway.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJack ... Jack ... You're acting like
tta kid.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around
ttone of these assholes and you turn into a
ttfucking three-year-old.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat's the matter with you?  So the piano's a
ttlittle out of tune.  So what?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(stopping)
ttChrist, can't you hear it?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo! I never hear it!
ttt(shaking his head)
ttMaybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know.
ttBut I won't let it bother me.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttDoesn't it matter to you?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat matters to me is we've got the six easiest
ttnights we've had in ten years.  
ttSo 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat.  
ttSo what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody.
ttSo why should you care?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBecause I can hear it.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWell, then stuff cotton in your ears, because
ttcome six o'clock we're gonna walk into that
ttdining room with smiles on.
ttUnderstand, little brother?


<b>tINT.  HOTEL ROOM
</b>
tFrank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror.
tJack, sitting at the window, his foot up against the
tglass, drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean
tgoes dark.  After a moment, Susie enters wearing a
tlittle tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHey, fellas.  What's the word?

tNothing.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhat's with you two?

</b>ttJack woke up on the wrong side
ttof the bottle.

tSusie looks at Jack.  Then Frank.

</b>tt0-kay.


<b>tINT.  LOUNGE
</b>
tAs Jack, Frank and Susie perform "Strangers in the Night,"
tdozens of couples move slowly on the dance floor,
twhile others sit at candle-lit tables, sipping cocktails.
tAs the song ends, the couples applaud.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThank you, thank you.
ttt(as applause dies)
ttYou know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived
tthere yesterday, but already the people here at the
ttKing Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel,
ttwell, a part of the family. And it's their hope that,
ttbefore you leave, everyone of you will feel a part
ttof that family also.  So, if during-the next few days,
ttwe should happen to pass one another in the hallway
ttor in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger.
ttStop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here,
ttthere are no strangers, only friends.  
ttAnd family.  Right, Jack?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttRight.  I love you, Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(stunned)
ttWhat?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI love you.  I just wanted to say it.

tFrank stares incredulously at Jack.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttUh, well, I love you, too, Jack.
ttt(moving quickly along)
ttSo. Susie.  How 'bout it.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttGot another song for us?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWell then ... shall we?


<b>tBACKSTAGE
</b>
tFrank corners Jack as they exit the stage.
tSusie looks around nervously to see if anyone's watching.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttWhat's the matter with you?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family.
ttI just got emotional.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHow dare you say you love me.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt won't happen again.  Scout's
tthonor.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhat's with you guys?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttSomeone needs to grow up.  I won't
tttake it, Jack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSure you will.

tJack pushes past Frank and leaves.  
tFrank watches him go, then turns to leave himself.


<b>tINT.  BATHROOM
</b>
tMiddle of the night.  Jack, fully clothed,
tis sitting on the rim of the tub, smoking.
tSusie enters.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOh, sorry.  With the light always
tton, it's hard to tell.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt's okay.
ttt(the cigarette)
ttLast one.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttCan't sleep?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIn and out.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttIt's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say.
ttShe was crazy for the ocean.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah, well, I wish God would go
tta little easy on the trumpets.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHow's egghead?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttLike a baby. You?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttIn and out.

tJack nods.  Susie looks at him carefully.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIf you want, I got a pack in the
ttroom.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo thanks.  I never touch French
ttcigarettes.


<b>tINT.  LOBBY - DAY
</b>
tThe next morning.  As Jack passes through the lobby,
the hears the plaintive PLINKING of a PIANO.  Curious,
the goes to the dining room and peers in.  
tThe tables have yet to be set for the evening and,
texcept for Frank, the room is empty.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat the hell are you doing?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(not looking up)
ttWhat's it look like I'm doing?
ttI'm tuning a goddamn piano.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttReally.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy,
ttJack.  If you say it's out of tune,
ttit's out of tune.

tJack smiles to himself and crosses the room.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHow's it coming?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttFine.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHow long you been at it?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(shrugging)
ttHalf-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna
ttget breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThey stopped serving two hours ago.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttTwo hours ago!

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttTime flies, huh?

tFrank looks despairingly at the pianos.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI could give you a hand.  If
ttyou want.


<b>tINT.  DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tJack and Frank are eating lunch.  Frank has a tiny
tstack of blue cards he's perusing.  
tHe holds one out to Jack.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat do you make that?  Paruchi?

tJack nods.  Frank continues to go through the cards
tas he speaks.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou haven't seen Susie, have you?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo. Why?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJust wonder what she's up to.
ttI never see her.  Makes me nervous.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttShe's a big girl.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better
ttkeep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.
ttt(another card)
ttHey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane.  
ttMarried seventy-five years.  You believe that?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat the hell are these?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttDedications.  I came up with the idea on the road.
ttSee, every morning the maids drop one of these
ttcards in each room.  The guest fills out the card,
ttleaves it at the front desk, and that night we play
ttit.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.
ttt(whispering)
ttAnd that's not all.  Last night, after the nine
tto'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking
ttabout our availability.  Like he wants to line
ttsomething up.
ttI think he's got a hard-on for Susie.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttExcuse me.

tFrank jumps.  A WOMAN in a bright flowered gift shop
tdress pokes her head in.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttI'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting
tthere, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.

</b>ttOh. Well, thank you.

<b>ttttFLORENCE SIMMONS
</b>ttNo, I mean you.

ttI have a brother-in-law who looks exactly like you.

ttin your family tree, do you?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttAfraid not.

<b>ttttFLORENCE SIMMONS
</b>ttWell, it's frightening.  You could be his twin.
ttOf course, he doesn't have your talent.  Musically,
ttI mean.  He sharpens things for a living.  Lawn
ttmower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge.
ttCan imagine?

tJack is having a hard time imagining Florence Simmons.

<b>ttttFLORENCE SIMMONS
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWell, anyway, I just had to make sure there was
ttno relation.  You play wonderfully.  Both of you.

tFlorence Simmons gives a little flutter of
ta wave and exits.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttFunny, huh?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThinking there's someone who looks like you,
ttwalking around the street somewhere.
ttt(smiling)
ttWonder if I saw him I'd think it
ttwas you?


<b>tEXT.  HOTEL - DAY
</b>
tJack is standing on the walkway that encircles the
thotel, watching the waves tumble into one another.  
tAs he starts to take out a cigarette, he notices
tFlorence Simmons standing a few yards away
twith a camera.

<b>ttttFLORENCE SIMMONS
</b>ttI just know my sister won't believe
ttme. Do you mind?

tJack shakes his head and Florence starts to aim the
tcamera.

<b>ttttFLORENCE SIMMONS
</b>ttI really hate to impose.  It's just that the
ttresemblance is so extraordinary.
ttt(focusing)
ttI wonder if you could turn this way so your face
ttisn't in the shadows.

tAs Jack turns, he glances over Florence's swaying
tshoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other
tend of the walkway.  They are leaning into the wind,
ther hair blowing free, brushing the man's face.

<b>ttttFLORENCE SIMMONS
</b>ttSay cheese.

tThe camera clicks.

<b>ttttFLORENCE SIMMONS
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttGotcha.  Would you like a copy for
ttyourself?  The hotel develops.

tJack glances away from Susie and the man.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo.

tON Jack's expression APPLAUSE is heard and a moment
tlater we --

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>

<b>tINT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tThat evening.  The trio has just finished a song and
tthose on the dance floor are clapping.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThank you.  You know, before we came out here
ttthis evening, Susie and Jack and I were looking
ttover your dedications and something struck us.

tSusie and Jack look at Frank as if they have no idea
twhat he's talking about.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWe realized that, well, we're really not so
ttdifferent from one another after all.  Oh sure,
ttwe may be at different points in our journey,
ttbut we all travel pretty much the same road.
ttAnd so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce
ttyou to two very special couples.  First, married
ttfor all of two days, please say hello to Helen
ttand Bud Wilson.  Helen.  Bud.

tThose standing on the dance floor applaud as the young
tcouple from the beat-up Eldorado make their way to the
tfront of the room.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAnd now, our second couple.  I'm talking about
ttEthel and Bert Lane, ladies and gentlemen.  Now,
ttEthel and Bert would be upset with me if I told
ttyou they'd been married for fifty years.  Why?
ttBecause, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane
tthave been married for seventy-five years!

tThe audience lets go with an audible "ooh"
tand applauds enthusiastically.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttEthel, Bert.  Get up here and
ttshow these kids how it's done.

tA path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make
ttheir way to the dance floor.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAren't they a sight?

tThey are indeed, and a sight slower getting to the
tdance floor than Frank anticipated.

tHe nods to Jack and they launch into "The Anniversary
tWaltz," but have to keep repeating the opening passage
twhile they wait for Ethel and Bert.  Finally, everyone
ton the dance floor steps back and, with some help from
ta few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the
tway, Ethel and Bert Lane begin to dance in the center
tof the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger
tcouple whirls around them like a youthful satellite.


<b>tINT.  BATHROOM
</b>
tJack is sitting in the bathroom again, smoking.  He
thears Susie's door open, then VOICES -- hers and a
tman's.  He puts out his cigarette in the
tsink and leaves.


<b>tINT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
tThe next morning.  Frank, the early bird, is
treturning to the room with a newspaper under his arm.
tWhistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to
tsee a man exit Susie's room.  Astonished, then outraged,
the goes to Susie's door and knocks sharply.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(opening door)
ttForget your tie, handsome ...
ttFrank!

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou want to tell me what the
tthell's going on?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI just saw a man walk out of
ttyour room.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttUh ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIn case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be
tthere.  So it might be nice if you conducted
ttyourself with a certain amount of decency.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttDecency?  Hey listen, pal ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo. You listen.  I had my doubts
ttabout you from the beginning

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHey!

tFrank and Susie turn.  Jack is standing in the hallway.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhat're you trying to do?  Wake
ttup the whole goddamn hotel?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe were just having a little
ttdiscussion about morality.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttSome discussion.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI just saw a man walk out of your
ttroom!

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou saw wrong.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe's with the hotel.  I called him.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWe had a leak in the bathroom.
ttHe fixed it.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHe was wearing a suit.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe had to come quickly.  It was
tta big leak.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHow come I didn't hear anything?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou're a heavy sleeper, Frank.
ttYou've always-been a heavy sleeper.
ttt(looking at Susie)
ttUnlike me.

tFrank looks at Jack, then Susie.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI guess I ... If I jumped to...

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttForget it.

tThe three stand there awkwardly for a moment.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWell...

tFrank shrugs lamely and exits.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttBoy, he comes on like a hurricane
ttin the morning, doesn't he?

tJack just stares at her.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYeah, well, thanks for sticking
ttyour head in.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHey, business is business.

tHe turns to leave.  Susie's eyes narrow.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttIt wasn't business.  It was pleasure.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttJust dinner and dance, right?


<b>tINT.  DINING ROOM
</b>
tJack, Frank and Susie are sitting at a table in the
tsmaller dining room.  It is conspicuously quiet.  
tThe main course seems to be a conscious attempt to
tignore each other.  Finally, Susie looks at Frank.  
tThen Jack.  Then out the window.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttParadise.


<b>tINT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tJack and Frank's room.  It is New Year's Eve,
tjust before show time, and Jack and Frank are in
ttheir tuxes.  Frank is on the phone.


<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttYes, Daddy promises.  I'll bring you one of the
ttlittle glasses, how's that?  Just like Grandma has.  
ttIt has a picture of the hotel on it and everything
tt... No, honey, they don't sell puppies here ...
ttWho? ... Well, we'll see.  Let me talk to Mommy,
ttokay?... Okay,sweetheart.  Happy New Year.
ttt(waits)
ttHi, honey.  She says Angela Secoli got a puppy for
ttChristmas.  Explain to her why we can't ... I don't
ttknow, tell her you're allergic ... It's not lying.
ttWell, okay, it is lying, but ... All right, then tell
tther I'll explain it ... He what? ... No kidding?
ttWithout the training wheels?
ttt(affected by this)
ttWell, that's great.  Tell him, tell him. I can't wait
ttto see ... No, no new bike.  Maybe for his birthday ...
ttOkay.  Listen, honey, I have to go.We're on in ten
ttminutes ... Yeah, Happy New Year ... I love you ...

tFrank sets the phone down and stares at it.  
tJack studies him a moment, then Frank suddenly
tclaps his hands.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWell, let's go.  The public waits.


<b>tINT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tA mass of swarming, jubilant people.  The voices are
thigh and loud and there's not a hand without a
tchampagne glass.  Couples lean into one another
tintimately, dancing gaily between the tables, toasting
tstrangers without hesitation.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(yelling to be heard)
ttAll right, everyone.  This is it.
ttLet's hear it.  Ten.  Nine ...

tGradually, the entire room joins the chant.

<b>ttttFRANK/EVERYONE
</b>ttEight.  Seven.  Six.  Five.
ttFour.  Three.  Two!  ONE!
<b>ttHAPPY NEW YEAR!
</b>
tThere is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to
tfind that certain someone to kiss in the new year.  
tIn this moment, Jack, Frank and Susie find themselves
toddly removed from the frantic cheer below them,
ttheir presence suddenly unnecessary, forgotten.  
tFinally, Susie walks over to Frank and gives him a kiss,
tthen goes to Jack.  They hesitate, then kiss lightly,
tpulling away and glancing awkwardly into each other's
teyes.  Frank sounds the first chord of "Auld Lang Syne"
tand Susie looks away from Jack and returns to her place
ton the stage.  As she begins to sing, the others in the
troom, all intimate friends for one brief moment,
tbegin to sing with her.

<b>ttttSUSIE/EVERYONE
</b>ttLest old acquaintances be forgot ...

tAs the voices slowly fade, they are joined by the
tsound of the OCEAN until the ocean is all we hear
tand we see:


<b>tINT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tJack, lying on his bed in the dark.  He opens his eyes,
tsquinting against the light from the bathroom, then
tglances over to Frank's bed and detects the outline
tof a body in the darkness.  Swinging his legs over the
tside, he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes.
tSuddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in
tthe next bed shifts, falling into the shaft of light cast
tfrom the bathroom.  It is a little boy.  Startled, Jack
tstares at the sleeping boy, then hears movement in the
tbathroom.  Rising slowly, he walks to the bathroom and
tgently eases the door open a few inches.  Inside, swimming
tmurkily in the steamy mirror, is the reflection of a man.  
tHis back is to Jack, but Jack can see that the man is
tshaving.  As Jack lets his gaze drop to the floor, he sees
tthat water is dripping off the man's pant cuffs and
tgathering in pools on the bathroom floor ... Jack wakes
tup.  He stares at the ceiling, listening to the waves,
tthen lifts his head and looks to the bathroom.  It is
tdark. Turning, he glances at Frank's bed.  It's empty.


<b>tINT.  DINING ROOM
</b>tDark and soundless.  Balloons, streamers and the other
tdebris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow.  
tFrank is sitting at the window, drinking as he stares at
tthe ocean.  As Jack crosses the room, he looks up.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttAh, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear.
ttHappy New Year, little brother.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat're you doing down here?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttCelebrating.  Join me?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThe party's over.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo, you're wrong.  It's just beginning.
ttCome on, have a drink.  
ttShow your big brother how it's done.

tFrank pours him a glass.  Jack notices the bottle.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttExpensive hangover.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttA gift.  Courtesy of our courteous
tthotel manager, Mr. Daniels.
ttt(toasting Jack)
ttWe, dear brother, are a fucking
ttsmash.
ttt(nodding)
ttYup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they
tthave this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids.
ttAdults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with
ttTimexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais
ttand everyone has a grand time crawling around on
ttthe front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a
ttdance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in
tta different colored shell and at the end of the
ttevening they crack themselves open.  It's our job
ttto separate the yolks from the whites.
ttSlippery business.

tFrank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink, then
tleans his head back, staring at the ceiling.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou know, I've never kissed my wife on New Year's.
ttNot once in twelve years.

tJack studies Frank as he stares at the ceiling.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThe Holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it?
ttWith the blue glass.

tJack looks up at the chandelier.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThe Royal.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttRight.  The Royal.  When's the
ttlast time we were there?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttCouple years.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttFebruary?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttApril.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttRight.  It's incredible how you
ttdo that.  Remember things.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttA useless talent.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttDrove me crazy when we were kids.
ttThe way you never looked at the music.
ttMiss Simpson would just play it and ...

tFrank snaps his fingers.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThey were simple songs.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNot for me.  I still have to look at the music
ttsometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget.
ttI just forget.  But you.  You never forget.
ttEver.
ttt(turning)
ttSo how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI told you.  It's a useless talent.

tFrank studies Jack a moment, then stares out at the
tocean.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttGod, the old man would've loved
ttthis view, wouldn't he?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI always think of him on New Year's.  
ttHow he used to pour us each half a can of beer.
ttRemember?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou always threw up.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice.
ttHe loved that about you.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe was just having fun.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt was like you'd passed some test,
ttyou know?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt was just a can of beer, Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah, but he told you things.  He never told me
ttanything.  Even though I was the oldest.  
ttIt was always you two, running off, doing things
tttogether.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou could've come.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI could've.  But he didn't want
ttme to.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou're making things up, Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttMaybe so.
ttt(pause)
ttYou ever go back there?  Where it
tthappened.

tJack stares at the angry SEA, LOUD even through the
tthick glass.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo.


<b>tEXT.  HOTEL - DAY
</b>
tThe next morning.  Jack is sitting outside the hotel,
twatching HELEN and BUD WILSON pack up the Eldorado.  
tThe streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal
tto the car's exterior.  After a moment, Frank exits with
ta little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a
ttiny souvenir shot glass.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWant one?

tJack shakes his head.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAh well, the kids'll break a
ttcouple anyway.

tSuddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the
tnewlyweds are heard.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttGive me the keys.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttYou're not going to drive.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttGive me the keys!

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttYou're not going to drive!

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttIt's my goddamn car!

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttIt's our goddamn car!

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttGive me the keys.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttNo.

tBud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but
tshe's too quick and runs to the other side of the car.
tFrustrated, he begins to run around the car like a
tmadman, trying to catch her.  Finally, when he gets
tclose, she darts off, sprinting across the parking lot.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI think I'll warm up the car.


<b>tOVERVIEW - CITY
</b>
tCold, dark, dangerous, but somehow looking quite
tappealing after a week in paradise.


<b>tINT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
tThe trio, looking road-weary, is parked in front
tof Jack's building.  It is very late.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThat takes care of this week.  The tenth we
ttgot the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're
ttat the Capri.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThe tenth's out.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI can't make the tenth.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI mean maybe you should check with us before you
ttgo off and book us a month in advance.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttBe reasonable, Jack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank.
ttHow much more reasonable you expect me to be?

tJack gets out of the car.  Frank shakes his head in
texasperation, then looks to Susie.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHow about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah
ttthis weekend?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(distracted)
ttHuh?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttForget it.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT
</b>
tJack lets himself in and closes the door quietly.
tIn the darkness he can make out Nina and Eddie,
tcurled up on the couch, asleep.  Above them,
thung carefully on a string, are some paper letters:
<b>t"WELCOME HOME."
</b>

<b>tINT.  LOUNGE
</b>
tIn a lounge whols basic decor makes abundant use of
tseveral historical eras but which might best be described
tas Modern Pilgrim, Jack, Susie and Frank perform
t"Feelings," while waiters in huge Paul Revere hats pass
tin and out of view.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttFeelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings
tt... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ...


<b>tKITCHEN
</b>
tJack, Frank and Susie exit the lounge to applause.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI can't sing it anymore.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttThat song.  I can't sing it anymore.
ttI'm gonna get sick.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat're you talking about?  They
ttlove it.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it.  
ttLet's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(as to a child)
ttSusie.  It's one more show.  One
ttmore time.  That's all.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttAnd two more times tomorrow night, and two more
tttimes the next night, and the next night and the
ttnext night and the next night.  Frank, I can't
ttsing that fucking song anymore!

tShe's yelling.  The kitchen workers are glancing over.
tJack studies her as she tries to calm herself.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI need some air.


<b>tEXT.  HOTEL
</b>
tA few minutes later.  Jack comes out of the hotel and
tsees Susie pacing.  
tHe sits down and watches her for a moment.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou're gonna wear down those
ttheels if you don't give it a rest.

ttShe stops.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttRelax.  We'll drop the song.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttGuess I got a little scattered.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt's a shitty  song.

tSusie nods and looks up at the glittering hotel.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHow do you do it? Every night?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttPractice.
ttt(pause)
ttThere are worse songs, you know.
ttNot many, but a few.

tSusie nods.  Jack studies her.  Something's on her
tmind.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttListen...
ttt(looks into his eyes)
ttNothing.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DUSK
</b>
tA record is spinning on Jack's phonograph as the sun
tgoes down outside his window.  As we MOVE AWAY FROM
tthe phonograph and PAST the window, we FIND Jack at
tthe piano, playing along with the record,
tlost in concentration.


<b>tEXT.  BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tSusie is working on a Paris Opal, pacing, occasionally
tglancing up at Jack's apartment, where the MUSIC can be
theard FAINTLY.  After a moment, she drops her cigarette
ton the sidewalk.  There are half a dozen others
talready there.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT
</b>
tThe record finishes, but the needle doesn't pick up,
tbumping into the label.  Jack glances at the clock next
tto him and gets up.  He puts on a jacket, then takes a
tpair of gloves and pulls them on carefully.


<b>tEXT.  BUILDING
</b>
tAs Jack comes out of his building, Susie stops pacing,
tsurprised.  Jack, wearing the same look of concentration
the had at the piano, doesn't see her and turns down the
tother end of the street.  Susie starts to call after
thim, but stops.


<b>tEXT.  JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tThe sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky.  
tWe see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club.


<b>tINT.  CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tJack is sitting in the shadows near the stage, where
ta trio is playing.  He has a drink in front of him,
tbut it is untouched.  After a moment, the trio finishes
tand the pianist, a huge black man named HENRY, nods to
tthe applause.


<b>ttttHENRY
</b>ttThank you.  As most of you know, we like to shake
ttthings up here every so often just to keep you
ttpeople on your toes.  So I'm gonna take a little
ttrest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit
ttin.  He drops by about once a year just to keep
tthis hands clean.  Ladies and gentlemen.  
ttJack Baker.

tJack rises to polite applause and shakes Henry's hand.  
tAs he settles behind the piano, he sits for a moment,
tnot moving, then nods to the two men behind him.  As they
tbegin to play, we recognize the music from the record.  
tJack waits, then brings his hands to the keys.  As he
tplays, his face is suddenly calm.  Peaceful.


<b>tEXT.  CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tLater.  Jack comes out of the club and into the night,
tlighting a cigarette as he moves up the street.

<b>ttttSUSIE (O.S.)
</b>ttYou were good.

tJack stops.  Susie.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI can keep the beat.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttBetter than that.

tJack's face goes a little cold, but he says nothing,
tbeginning to walk again.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhat's the matter?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNothing.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhat'd I say?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNothing.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYou're upset.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'm not upset.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttAll I said was you were good.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(stops)
ttLook. You don't know good. All right?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWhat's that supposed to mean?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt means you wouldn't know good
ttif it came up and fucked you.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYou were good.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttLet's make a deal.  You shut up.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYou were good.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(exasperated)
ttHow do you know?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttBecause I saw the other people!
ttAnd they knew you were good!
ttYou were good, goddamnit!

tJack studies Susie, then glances off.  For a moment,
tthey just stand on the corner, not talking.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSo you wanna get a drink?

</b>ttFriend?  What's she look like?
ttMaybe I can help you find her.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttShe's four feet tall.  Ed?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttEd? How many people live here?

tEddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at
tSusie.  Jack moves to the kitchen.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI have to make him some chili.
ttOkay?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(a look)
ttSure.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
tLight from a weak lamp, lots of shadows, as romantic
tas Jack's apartment will ever get.  Outside the window,
tthe city looks like a thousand jewels, gleaming.

tSusie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly
tabout the room, slipping, in and out of the shadows as
tif they were veils.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(at window)
ttLike diamonds, huh?  I never get over it.  
ttWhen I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before
ttthe window and tell me to close my eyes and make a
ttwish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights
ttof the city and string them into-a necklace for
ttmyself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her
tteyes, I don't know, it was like she really
ttbelieved it.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHow come you didn't close your eyes?

tShe looks surprised by the question.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI don't know.  I guess I didn't
tttrust the night like she did.

tSusie finishes her drink and sets it down.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLet me have a cigarette, will you?  
ttAll of mine are down there on the sidewalk.

tJack looks at her curiously.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLong story.

tJack gives her an American cigarette and lights it.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou know, I saw you guys once.
ttYou and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttMust've been a cheap date.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttSoap convention.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSoap?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYeah, they got a convention for everything. At
ttleast he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I
ttwas with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The
ttolder ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled
ttthe chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...
ttt(shaking her head)
ttMama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you
ttcan feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with
tthim again.  She thought she had it all figured out.  
ttBut she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with
ttpalms like a baby.

tSusie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIt wasn't so bad, though.  I'd get a nice piece of
ttsteak, flowers, sometimes even a gift.  Usually
ttwhatever the guy was into.  Got a socket set once.  
ttBelieve it?  The guy looked like held just given me
ttfour dozen roses.
ttt(almost wistful)
ttBut I stayed at the Hartford once.  You should see
ttthe rooms.  All satin and velvet.  And the bed.  
ttRoyal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow.  Hard to
ttbelieve sleeping in a room like that don't change
ttyour life.  But it don't.  The bed may be magic, but
ttthe mirror isn't.  You wake up the same old Susie.
ttt(pause)
ttI didn't always, you know.  If I liked the guy ...

tSusie looks at Jack, but he just takes a drink.  She
tlooks out the window again.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSometimes I wish the sun would never come up.

tShe stares at the lights another moment, then turns and
tnods to the phone booth.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSo what's this?

tJack frowns, takes another drink.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHistory.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttMy father proposed to my mother
ttin there.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttNo kidding?

tIt's a small phone booth.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThe both of them?  In there?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe called her.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOh. So what's it doing here?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttLong story.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYou sending me home?

tJack locks eyes with Susie, then glances away.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThey'd been out dancing all night and he took
tther to the train station -- she lived over in
ttBrookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this
tttime he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home,
ttonly as he's walking he starts getting nervous.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttNervous?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBy the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's
ttgot her meeting some rich guy on the train, the
ttrich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading
ttabout it in the morning edition.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYou're kidding.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe had a mind that escalated things.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttSo, what happened?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks
tthe's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks
tthe's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing
ttyou know he's got his brothers down there and
ttthey're tearing the thing right off the curb.

tSusie blinks.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was
ttgonna try and call her.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWow.  But I still don't see how ...

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttMa didn't want it around.  After.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOh.

tJack glances out the window.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing, carefully)
ttFrank said you saw him die.

tJack glances up quickly, surprised.  He nods.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttFrank said ---

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFrank wasn't 'there.

tSusie stops, looks down.  Jack studies her for a moment,
tthen decides.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe took me out to the docks one day.  We did that a
ttlot.  There were other places, but he loved the ocean.
ttHe'd worked boats as a kid.  Never got rid of it.
ttIt was always in him.  He'd drink a little when we'd
ttgo.  If he drank enough, he'd do this funny Irish jig.
ttTo make me laugh.
ttt(pause)
ttHe drank a lot that day.

tSusie studies Jack as he stares into his glass.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThere was a lot of wind.  He was up on this cargo
ttshelf, right over the ocean.  And he started to
ttdo the jig.  One minute he was there ...
ttt(shrugs)
ttI thought it was a joke at first.
ttHe did things like that.  Games.
ttt(pause)
ttI was laughing when it happened.

tJack stares at the glass in his hands, then glances
tup and catches Susie looking at him.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou got pretty eyes, you know that.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S BEDROOM
</b>
tJack's bed.  In the darkness, we see Susie's profile,
ther eyes looking up toward the ceiling.  Jack's body
tfalls slowly across her and he kisses her neck.


<b>tEXT.  JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
</b>
tWe see Eddie, wearing his Christmas sweater,
tsleeping on the fire escape.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
tSusie is dressed, sitting at the piano, staring out the
twindow as she absently hits a key.  She is smoking one
tof Jack's cigarettes.  Distracted.  Jack comes to the
tdoorway and watches her.  Plink.  Plink.  Plink.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou gotta move 'em around if you want to
ttplay a song.

tSusie starts, looks at her hand on the piano,
tpulls it away.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOh. Hi.  Sorry.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttCoffee?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYeah... No.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttLook, if you want to leave...

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!

tSusie throws the cigarette out the window,
tthen looks down.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttShit.  I think I started a fire.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIf our feet get hot, you grab
ttthe piano.

tSusie smiles weakly.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhy don't you go.  I'll see you
tttomorrow night at the Ambassador.

tSusie doesn't move.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI followed you last night.  I
ttmean, I was here.  Outside.  I was
ttabout to come up when you came out.

tJack waits.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThe reason I came by ... I couldn't tell Frank...
ttI'm leaving.  The act.

tSusie stares up at Jack, but he says nothing.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIt's a ... I met this guy at the resort.  He liked
ttmy voice.  And, it's ... He thinks I can sell cat
ttfood just by singing about it.  Can you believe it?

tSusie tries a laugh.  Jack nods.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou can always get another girl.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(looks out window)
ttThere's always another girl.


<b>tINT.  LOUNGE
</b>
tJack and Frank stand in a lounge, talking to NICK, the
tmanager.  Busboys move in and out, preparing the room
tfor the evening.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttSick?  How sick?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThe flu.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttSo she's got a few sniffles.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttDoctor's orders.

tNick frowns, looking at the two pianos across the room.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttYou got no right springing this on me, Frankie.  
ttIt's unethical.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttLook, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttWhat am I gonna do?  Put a record
ttplayer out there?
ttt(exiting)
ttBad, Frankie.  Bad.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(to Frank)
ttWhat're you doing?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJust until we find another girl.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttCancel, Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou want to know how much I got tied up in
ttdeposits with Willie?  We're in for three
ttweeks solid, Jack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBetter give her pneumonia.


<b>tINT.  BACK ROOM
</b>
tJack and Frank find themselves in the back room of
tWillie's again.  They do not look happy.

<b>ttttGIRL (O.S.)
</b>ttRemember me?

tJack and Frank look up.  A girl in a yellow and black
tdress is in the doorway.  She looks like a bumblebee.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttMonica.  Monica Moran.  I came in the last time
ttyou guys were looking for a singer.
ttt(smiling)
ttPerseverance.  First rule of show business.

tJack and Frank just stare at her.

<b>ttttMONICA (GIRL)
</b>ttI bought a book.  That's what it says.


<b>tEXT.  WILLIE'S - LATER
</b>
tFrank is looking at a list.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe got the Roosevelt on Thursday, the Park in a
ttcouple of weeks.  Larry Shelton said he'd let me
ttknow by Friday on the Ambassador.  That's it.

tFrank folds the paper carefully.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI got some calls out.  Things
ttthat might be good for us.

tFrank looks over at Jack for the first time.  He's
tleaning against the building, staring at his shoes.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWe'll try for a girl again next
ttweek.

tJack nods.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttOkay.  Well, the Roosevelt then.


<b>tINT.  ROOSEVELT HOTEL - LOUNGE
</b>
tOnce grand, now dark and dusty looking.  A small crowd.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou know, my brother and I have been playing
tttogether, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttTwenty-eight years.

tNo response.  Bored, brutally indifferent faces.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOf course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little
ttdifferent.  We were just kids.  Just about the
ttonly one who would listen to us was the family
ttcat, Cecil.  We must've shaved three lives off old
ttCecil, huh, Jack?

tFrank laughs and his voice, eerily magnified by the
tmicrophone, is the only sound in the room.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing; hanging tough)
ttYeah, well, anyway.  It's nice to be back here in
ttthe Roosevelt Room, because this has always
ttbeen ...

tFrank falters as he sees Mrs. Baker enter the lounge and
tseat herself at a table in the back of the room.
tJack follows Frank's eyes and spots her.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
tta very special place for Jack and I.
ttt(recovering)
ttAnd tonight we'd like to open with a very special
ttsong.  It's the song my mother and father danced 
ttto the night they were married.  This is for them.


<b>tINT.  LOBBY
</b>
tJack watches as Frank gives Mrs. Baker a hug.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou should've told us you were coming, Ma.  
ttWe would've come and got you.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttSpur of the moment.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttSo what'd you think?

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttThrilling.
ttt(glancing at Jack)
ttBoth of you.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThe audience was a little off
tttonight.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttA few empty tables.  It's cozier.  
ttBesides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place
tton a Wednesday night.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we
ttget a little midnight snack?  
ttTheo's should still be open.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttNo, no.  You boys are tired.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo, we're not.  Jack?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttI'm tired.  Really.  I should get
tthome.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou sure?

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttt(nodding)
ttJust call me a cab.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttA cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half
ttblock down.  You wait here.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttAll right.

tFrank dashes out of the lobby.  Jack and Mrs. Baker
twatch him go, then turn to each other.  Mrs. Baker smiles
tawkwardly, then surveys the lobby.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIt's beautiful, isn't it?

tThe brocade on the walls has faded and the chairs -
tonce covered with velvet, now with a cheap imitation -
tlook old and dowdy, but the room still maintains an
telegant dignity.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah.


<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttThis was quite,a place once.  After the war.  On
ttFriday nights they had dances in the ballroom
ttupstairs.  It was beautiful.  Crystal chandeliers.
ttWhite tablecloths.  Orchids floating in the punch
ttbowls... It was a wonderful place to be young.

tJack watches his mother as her eyes pass over the room.
tAfter a moment, she nods toward the lounge.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIt went well tonight.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFrank works hard.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttAnd you don't?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHe leads, I follow.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttIs that the way it is?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttPretty much.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttHe mentioned you had a girl for
tta while.  A singer.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFor a while.  She left.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttYes, well, it's probably best.
ttNo sense bringing someone else in.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI suppose.

tMrs. Baker glances into the lounge, at the two pianos.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttFunny.  Watching tonight, I was
ttremembering when you were young.
ttHow I used to stand in the kitchen, listening to
ttthe two of you practice while I did the dishes.
ttt(smiling)
ttMy two little radios.  Sometimes I'd stop and go to
ttthe door and just watch.  Sometimes your father
ttwould too.
ttt(pause)
ttHe liked to listen to you play.
ttDid you know that?

tJack shakes his head.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou miss him, don't you?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt's been a long time, Ma.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttYes.
ttt(pause)
ttI supposed you still have that old phone booth.

tJack nods.  Mrs. Baker smiles, then it fades.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHis love scared me, you know.  The day he died he
tt left a flower on my pillow.

tJack looks puzzled.  Suddenly his mother reaches out
tand very gently touches her fingers to his face.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou look so like him.

tThey stand like this for a moment, connnected, then
tFrank steps in from the street.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYour limo's ready, Ma.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttAll right.

tMrs. Baker takes her hand from Jack's face and turns
taway.  Just before she exits, she looks back.

<b>ttttMRS.  BAKER
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttGood night, Jack.


<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>
tJack, walking home, turns a corner and suddenly stops.
tAcross the street, talking to a man, is Susie.  She says
ta few words to the man, then touches him lightly on the
tarm and begins to walk away.  Jack watches her retreat,
tthen follows, moving quicker as he draws close.  As he
treaches her, he gently touches her elbow and she turns.
tNot Susie.  The woman stares at Jack, startled.  
tFor a moment, he doesn't move.  Finally, he lets go of
ther elbow.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSorry.


<b>tINT.  CAR - NIGHT
</b>
tA few nights later.  Frank guides the car through wet
tcity streets.  It's two AM and raining hard.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWe're not getting paid then.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNothing. We get nothing.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI told you, Jack.  It's a telethon.
ttNo one gets a cent.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(a pause)
ttWhat's it for?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI don't know. Some disease.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat disease?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou don't know?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt's a disease, Jack.  We're against it.
ttIt's not a moral decision.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(another pause)
ttWhat channels it on?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttSeventy-one

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSeventy-one?  What's seventy-one?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(defensive)
ttA channel.  
ttIt's just a little further down the dial, that's all.
ttLook, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?

tJack stares at Frank.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttRight.


<b>tINT.  HALLWAY
</b>
tJack and Frank make their way down a hallway.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThe guy said to find Studio E and
ttturn right.  What's that say?

tSuddenly, a rapid-fire THUMPING SOUND resounds through
tthe corridor.  As Jack and Frank turn, they see a huge
tYOUTH in a wheelchair dribbling a basketball toward them.

<b>ttttYOUTH
</b>ttFast break!

tJack and Frank step back and watch the kid one-wheel it
taround the corner.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI guess it's that way.


<b>tINT.  STUDIO
</b>
tJerry Lewis need not fear.  This is strictly a tin foil
tand crepe paper operation. Along one wall is the "phone
tbank," monitored by a few sleepy volunteers, and opposite,
tin makeshift bleachers, is the audience.  A huge tote board,
tset on rolling astors, is next to the phones.  The total,
tat 2:15 AM, is $1125.38. As Jack and Frank enter, the kid
tin the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the
tcamera.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThis must be it.  I'll see when
ttwe're on.

tFrank leaves. Jack glances around the studio like he's
twalked into a nightmare.  At the phone bank, a heavyset
tMAN in a sweatshirt and a cap, looks over.  Both the
tsweatshirt and the cap have "Earl" printed on them.

<b>ttttEARL (MAN)
</b>ttYou the magician?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttEARL
</b>ttt(disappointed)
ttOh.  What do you do?

tJack points to the pianos across the room.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttPiano.

<b>ttttEARL
</b>ttt(hopeful)
ttTwo at a time?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttMy brother and I. One each.

<b>ttttEARL
</b>ttt(disappointed again)
ttOh.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(indicating the kid in the wheelchair)
ttWhat's wrong with the kid?


<b>ttttEARL
</b>ttKnee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right
ttbefore the accident.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttAccident?

<b>ttttEARL
</b>ttThe fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to
ttbuy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.

ttAs Jack registers this, Earl's PHONE RINGS.  Frank
ttreturns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWe're on after Meadowlark.
ttt(seeing Jack's face)
ttWhat's wrong?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttAre you kidding me?  Are you
ttfucking kidding me?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWe're playing for a goddamn
ttgymnasium!

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(worried)
ttWhat?

tBefore Jack can further enlighten Frank, the kid in the
twheelchair rolls off and a guy in a cheap rented tux
tstrides in front of the camera.  He's VINCE NANCY,
tthe host.

<b>ttttVINCE
</b>ttLet's hear it for our own Jimmy
ttMarshall, shall we?

tThe audience applauds.

<b>ttttVINCE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAs most of you'know, young Jimmy put a nasty twist
tton that knee trying to win-one for good ol' Grant
ttHigh this year.  Luckily, the doctors tell us
ttJimmy'll be able to play next season.  That is ...
ttif there is a next season.
ttt(Uncle Sam)
ttThat's where you come in.  Pick up that phone.  
ttMake a donation.  Let's keep our kids off the
ttstreets and in the gym where they belong.

tApplause.

<b>ttttVINCE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAll right.  Well, friends, what can I say about
ttour next guest?
ttt(consulting a card)
ttHe, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with
ttus two of the most respected men in the musical
ttentertainment field.  I think you'll agree with me
ttwhen I tell you we're in for a real treat when I
ttsay that we have with us ... the Fabulous Bunker
ttBoys!  Come on out here guys.

tVince gestures grandly to the left and Jack and
tFrank enter from the right.

<b>ttttVINCE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhoops, there they are.  Hey, nice
ttsuits, fellas.
ttt(to camera)
ttNow I know a lot of you amateur musicians out
ttthere are going to want to rap with these guys and
ttdon't worry.  Right after they finish up here,
ttthey're going to be manning the phones.  Maybe we
ttcan even convince them to raffle off a few piano
ttlessons if we're lucky.  What do you think?

tThe audience applauds.  Jack glares at Frank.  He shrugs.

<b>ttttVINCE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWell, all right then.  What are we
ttwaiting for?  Take it away, guys.

tJack and Frank poise their hands over their pianos and
tbegin to play.  As the music rises, the studio becomes
tvery quiet, almost still.  Unfortunately, Jack and Frank
tare barely through the opening passage when a thunderously
tLOUD BELL begins to RING.  Suddenly, Vince steps out
tagain.

<b>ttttVINCE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttUh oh.  We know what that means, don't we?  It's
tttime to turn the board over.
ttt(to Jack, Frank)
ttI'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute.  
ttLet's bring out the board.

tTwo post-pubescent giants roll out the tote board
tright in front of Jack and Frank.  
tJack looks positively homicidal.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJack ...

tJack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave.  
tThen, seeing the kid in the wheelchair, he grabs the
tbasketball and fires it at Vince.

<b>ttttVINCE
</b>ttWhat the --

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(pointing)
ttYou're a fucking creep, you know
ttthat.  I oughta kick your ass.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttJack, you're on television.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttShut up, Frank.

tEarl of the sweatshirt and cap puts his hand on
tJack's shoulder.

<b>ttttEARL
</b>ttWhat do you say we go for a walk,
ttpal.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttGet your hand off me.

<b>ttttEARL
</b>ttCome on, friend.  I can smell it on you.  
ttGet yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget
ttwhat you're angry about.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttGo fuck yourself.

<b>ttttEARL
</b>ttt(eyes go hard)
ttYou're a real tough guy when the
ttladies are around, aren't you, Ace?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI don't see any ladies here.
ttExcept maybe you.

tThat does it.  Earl takes hold of Jack's collar and
tstarts to-wrestle him roughly toward the door.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttHey, leave him alone.

<b>ttttEARL
</b>ttDo your brother a favor and have his mouth sewn up.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou're a lousy dancer, Earl.  Don't
ttyou know the man's supposed to lead?

tEarl shoves Jack into the hallway, hard.  
tJack stumbles back against the wall.

<b>ttttEARL
</b>ttWho do you think you are, asshole?
ttLiberace?


<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>
tJack walks down the street, mindless of the rain.  
tFrank follows a few yards behind.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJack.  We just,passed the car. Jack.  This is a
tttuxedo.  Three hundred dollars.
ttt(pause)
ttYou gonna talk to me?  Or is this Jack's famous
ttsilent act?  Look, it was for publicity.  
ttDo you understand?  Publicity.

tJack stops and stares at Frank incredulously.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat-are you?  A fucking moron?
ttIt's three o'clock in the morning,
ttFrank.  Who's watching?  Your wife?
ttMaybe you can get us a gig playing
ttLittle Frank's birthday party.
ttWhat do you think?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttLook.  I didn't know when we were going to be on
ttuntil yesterday.  What was I supposed to do?  
ttI had the pianos anyway.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBasketballs, Frank.  You had us
ttplaying for basketballs.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed
ttup.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle
ttof a gig.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(incredulous)
ttWhat?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt.  
ttA stupid-ass stunt.

tJack just stares at Frank, as if looking at a stranger.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing
ttass so long you're starting to like it?  You let
ttthat guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were
ttalways small time, but we were never clowns, Frank.  
ttWhat's happened to your dignity?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttDignity?  Who the hell are you to
tttalk about dignity?

tFrank suddenly steps forward and reaches into Jack's
tjacket, coming away with a bottle.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThis where you get your dignity, Jack?  
ttThis is where you get your courage?

tJack tries to grab the bottle but Frank holds it away.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttNo, let's do it straight for
ttonce, shall we?

tFrank tosses the BOTTLE into the street, where it
<b>tSHATTERS.
</b>
<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLet me explain something to you, little brother.  
ttSee, I've got people who depend on me.  I've got
tta wife and two children who expect to wake up every
ttmorning with food on the table and heat in the house.  
ttI got a mortgage.  I got car payments.  I got Ma's
ttmedical bills. Oh yeah, and I got you.  Yeah, you.  
ttJack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so
ttfucking sure he's better than everyone else.  Don't
ttyou think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes
ttand blow smoke in his face?  Goddamn right I would.  
ttBut I can't.  Because I have to be responsible, little
ttbrother.  I have to make sure the numbers balance out
ttin my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go
tton living their lives.  You don't win medals for it,
ttbut you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I
ttfolded up shop.  So don't talk to me about dignity,
ttlittle brother.  You're drawing on a weak hand.

tJack stares at Frank through the rain,
tthen turns and begins to walk away.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttGreat.  Terrific.  Walk away.  You're good at that,
ttJack.  Just don't forget to stop off for another
ttbottle of courage on your way home.
ttt(pause)
ttThat's what he'd do.

tJack stops, his back to Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou've found the perfect solution to all the
ttpain in the world, haven't you, little brother?  
ttEight-fifty a bottle, available any time day or
ttnight at your friendly neighborhood liquor store.  
ttYou're weak, Jack.  Just like he was.

tJack turns, tough and dangerous in the darkness.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttStay off it.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of
ttwatching you make him up into some kinda god.  
ttFor Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid
ttbullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He
ttwasn't a hero.  He was a fool.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(eerily cold)
ttYou weren't there.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThat's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the
ttluxury of being a witness to tragedy.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(coiled)
ttFuck you.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo, fuck you.  And fuck him too.
ttFuck the both-of you.

tJack suddenly bolts for,ward and grabs Frank by the
tlapels.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey, what're you doing?  Hey!

tJack flings Frank against the wall, pounding, pulling
tand slamming him in a fitful rage.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing; scared)
ttJack! ... Jack! ...

tFrank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect
thimself.  Jack hovers over him.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHow's it feel to have your little brother beat
ttthe shit out of you?  Huh?  Huh!

tJack comes down with a vicious fist at Frank's face.  
tFrank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself,
tand catches a blow on his fingers.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttMy hands!  My hands!

tJack grabs one of Frank's hands.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(mocking)
ttYour hands.  Your hands couldn't take the blue
ttribbon on amateur night.

tJack bends back Frank's fingers.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(terrified)
ttJack!

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWho's weak now, big brother?

tJack pushes Frank's fingers until the knuckles crack.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJack!  JACK!

tFrank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain.  
tSuddenly Jack stops.  Looking at Frank's hand, still
tclasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior
tas Frank.  Letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks
tat his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped
tand dirty.  He stares at his own hands, the knuckles split
tand bleeding.  He no longer looks dangerous.  He looks
thollow, frightened.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'm through with it.  I can't do
ttit anymore.

tFrank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at Jack, but Jack
tjust turns away, leaving Frank on the sidewalk, and
tdisappears into the rain.  MUSIC begins.  A sad, plaintive
tsolo piano.  And we see:


<b>tSERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
tJack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain
tover now.

tFrank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the
tdim glow of the streetlights.

tJack, letting himself into his apartment and standing
tthere.  Alone.

tFrank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off
tthe engine.

tJack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly.

tFrank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as
tthe sun begins to come up.

tJack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand.


<b>tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
tThe next morning.  Jack is sitting on the windowsill,
twatching the RAIN DRUM the GLASS.  He glances at the phone
tacross the room, takes another look at the rain, then goes
tto the phone.  He picks it up hesitantly, then dials.  
tIt rings.  Again.  Again.

<b>ttttCINDY (V.0.)
</b>ttHello?

tJack blinks.  It's Cindy.

<b>ttttCINDY
</b>ttHello ... Hellooooo ...
ttt(fainter)
ttDaddy.  Daddy!  Someone's on the
ttphone and they won't talk.

tJack sets the phone back down on the cradle.


<b>tINT.  BAR
</b>
tJack stands in a dark bar.  It is early morning and the
tlight from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere.  
tA big, beefy MAN with a bar towel hooked in his belt is
ttalking to Jack.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttIf they wanna talk about their wife, you listen.  
ttIf they wanna talk about their job, you listen.  
ttIf they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen.  
ttThat's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until I
ttsend you home.  Okay?

tJack nods and points to the piano in the corner.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThat it?

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttHow many you need?

tJack walks over to the giano and strikes a note.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIt's out of tune.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttTrust me, the way I fix a martini,
ttit'll be in tune.

tThe MUSIC RETURNS, sad and plaintive, and we see:


<b>tINT.  FRANK'S HOUSE
</b>
tFrank, attempting to give piano lessons to a brother
tand sister tandem who would be better served by an
tobedience school.  While the little girl pounds
tincessantly on the piano, her brother runs circles
taround the room, destroying everything in sight.

tMUSIC CONTINUES and we see:


<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>tJack and Eddie, going for a walk, passing the diner
twhere Jack and Frank's pictures are still displayed.

tMUSIC CONTINUES and we see:


<b>tINT.  BAR
</b>
tJack, in the bar, playing the music we've been hearing
tthroughout the previous scenes.  It is after midnight
tand the tables are empty.  Only a few somber men remain
tat the bar.  They do not appear to be music lovers.  
tAs Jack finishes, he takes a cloth and wipes the keys.  
tThere is a glass on the piano with money in it.

<b>ttttSUSIE (O.S.)
</b>ttI thought the Bakers didn't take
tttips.

tJack glances up, but he knows the voice.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI give it all to charity.

tSusie nods.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttSaw the sign outside.  Got your
ttown sign, huh?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah.  Got my own sign.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttSo ... ?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWe outgrew each other.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYeah, well, like I said, it didn't
ttfigure.  You two.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou don't pick your brother.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSo how's the cat food business?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttTerrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.

tJack nods.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat kind?

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttVegetables.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of
ttthe important ones.

tSusie tries a smile.  Takes a breath.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttListen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new
ttplace.  Or we could go to a bar ...
ttt(looking around)
ttWell, maybe not a bar.  But I know
tta place uptown, if you want --

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI've given it up.

tSusie stops.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttNo kidding?  Well ... I guess you can't do a
ttreunion over tomato juice, can you?
ttt(pause)
ttAnyway, if you're ever in the
ttneighborhood ... I wrote it down.

tSusie takes a slip of paper from her purse and hands
tit to Jack.  They lock eyes for a moment.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttTell egghead I said hi.  If you
ttsee him.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttIf I see him.

tSusie nods and walks toward the door.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey.
ttt(as she stops)
ttYou got pretty eyes.

tSusie smiles.  As she leaves, Jack studies the slip
tof paper in his hand, then drops it in the tip glass.  
tHe glances at the door, swinging slowly shut in Susie's
twake, then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle.


<b>tINT.  FRANK'S DEN
</b>
tFrank sits alone in the darkness of the den.  The
tcardboard stand-up is there, along with several old
tphotographs, including one showing two skinny kids in
ttuxes standing with a glamorous Peggy Lee.  After a moment,
tDonna enters.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttFrank?  It's late, honey.

tFrank stays staring at the photograph of Peggy Lee.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttMrs. Lerner called after dinner.  Robbie can't make
tthis lesson tomorrow.

tDonna waits for her husband to say something, then sees the
tphotograph in his hand.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou know how good he is?  It's like breathing
ttwith him.  I've always envied it.  But tonight,
ttlooking at all this -- at his face -- I don't know.  
ttMaybe it's worse.  For him.
ttt(gesturing to the piano)
ttIt's funny.  When I sit here and play ... nothing.  
ttBut when I was up there with him...
ttIt was like I had the gift, too.


<b>tINT.  FRANK'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NEXT DAY
</b>
tFrank is standing in the hallway of his house, leaning
tagainst the bathroom door.  It's locked.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttCome on, Jeremy.  Open the door.

tSomewhere in the house, the PHONE RINGS.  
tFrank ignores it.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttJeremy.  You want me to call your father?  
ttHe's not going to be very happy when he hears
tthe's spending fifteen dollars an hour for you
ttto sit on the toilet.

tDonna, looking shaken, steps into the hallway.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttHoney ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm
ttplaying 'Camptown Races' for him and the next
ttthing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom.  
ttThere's nothing sharp in there, is there?

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttHoney ...

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWhere are our kids?  
ttHas he got one of them in there?

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttFrank.

tFrank finally looks at his wife.  She's crying.


<b>tINT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
tJack rushes down a hospital corridor and heads for the
tnurses station.  As he moves to the counter, Donna
tappears.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttDonna.  Where is she?

tDonna just shakes her head.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttWe tried the apartment, but after
ttthat we didn't know where to call.

tJack looks frozen.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttFrank'll be back in a moment.  
ttHe took Little Frank to the bathroom.

tJack begins to back away slowly.

<b>ttttDONNA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttJack ...

<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>
tJack moves aimlessly down the street, slipping in
tand out of shadows.  Finally he stops inside a closed
tstorefront, his back up against the window, and looks
tdown at his hands.  They're shaking.


<b>tINT.  APARTMENT HALLWAY
</b>
tJack stands in an apartment hallway, waiting.  
tAfter a moment, the door opens.  It's Susie.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttJack.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHi.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttWell, this is some surprise.
ttt(seeing his face)
ttHey ... You don't look so good, pal.

tSusie studies Jack as he glances around the hallway.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttJack?

tJack looks up.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou want to come in?

tHe nods.  Susie steps back and Jack enters.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLet me get the light.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttNo.

tHe stares directly into her eyes.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLeave it dark.


<b>tINT.  SUSIE'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING
</b>
tJack is standing at the foot of the bed, looking down
tat Susie's naked back as she sleeps.  He studies her
tface as if looking for something, then takes his coat
tand begins to leave.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttI used to do that.

tJack turns.  Susie is looking at him.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could
ttwake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on
ttthe other end of it, though.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI didn't want to wake you.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(smiling slightly)
ttYeah.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThanks.  For letting me in last night.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttFunny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over.  
ttLike a song.

tJack looks at Susie for a long moment, then nods and
tturns for the door.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey.

tJack stops, his hand on the doorknob.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAm I gonna see you again?

tJack looks at her face, beautiful in the morning light.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah.  You're gonna see me again.

tSusie smiles slightly.

<b>ttttSUSIE
</b>ttOkay.


<b>tEXT.  STREET
</b>
tJack is standing across the street from his mother's
thouse, just looking.  After a moment, he crosses the
tstreet.  As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of
tthe tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it,
tkneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there --
tcat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the
tdamage smoothed and widened by time.  He runs his
tfingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks
ttoward the house.


<b>tEXT.  HOUSE
</b>
tThrough the screen door, Jack can hear a CLICKING
tsound and see partially into the front door.  Half
tthe room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light.  
tHe opens the door and enters.


<b>tINT.  HOUSE
</b>
tInside, the movie PROJECTOR is RUNNING, the tail of a
tcompleted FLIP SLAPPING like a whip against the carriage.  
tJack TURNS OFF the PROJECTOR and the room falls entirely
tinto shadow.  For a moment, the house is silent, full of
tghosts, then, gradually, a NOISE is heard coming from the
tkitchen.


<b>tINT.  KITCHEN
</b>
tAs Jack comes into the kitchen, he finds Frank searching
tthrough a cabinet.  He watches for a moment.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat're you looking for?

tFrank turns quickly, surprised.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI didn't hear you come in.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttWhat're you doing?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>tOh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But
tit seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of
tcooking sherry.

tJack nods.  Frank looks nervous.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttUh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd
ttwant to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there.  
ttIf you want to get started.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttLater.

tFrank nods.  Silence.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIs everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttOh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know.  
ttShe and Dad had taken care of it.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttRight.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're
ttdoing the stone today.
ttt(pause)
ttIt's okay?  Wednesday?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah, fine.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttThere's not going to be a viewing.
ttI figured with the kids and all ...

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttSure.

tJack glances around the room.  Pictures on the walls.  
tHandmade curtains, lightly faded.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttIt's funny.  Before, whenever I came here, the
tthouse seemed small.  But today ... I can't keep
ttup with it. I keep losing my wind.

tFrank smiles slightly and he and Jack lock eyes for a
tmoment.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing;glancing away)
ttGod, I could use a drink.

tJack hesitates, then pulls a bottle out of his coat.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttOh. Well, great.  I'll get a couple glasses.

tFrank moves to a cabinet, but there's nothing there.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttDamn.  Donna must've packed
ttthem up this morning.

tJack holds out the bottle.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttGo ahead.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttt(showing the seal is unbroken)
ttBought it on the way over.  Clean
ttas a nun.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttNo, it's not that.  I ... can't
ttdrink from the bottle.  I ... gag.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOh, yeah, right.  I forgot.

tFrank looks embarrassed.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(remembering)
ttOh, hey, I want to show you
ttsomething.  Come on.

tJack follows Frank back into the front room.  Frank
tstands before one of the tiny matching pianos and
tgestures Jack to the other.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHit the C. Go ahead.

tJack steps over to the other piano and taps, then Frank
tdoes the same.  Jack glances up in surprise.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI'm right, aren't I? They're
ttin tune.

tJack hits the note again and nods in amazement.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAll these years.  She kept them in tune.  
ttCan you imagine?  
ttNow why would she do something like that?

tFrank looks down at the keys and his smile fades.  
tSuddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot
tglasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a
tdifferent hotel.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have
ttthat drink after all.
ttt(picking up a few glasses)
ttWhat's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada.  
ttWe got the Travelodge on Route 41.  
ttAnd ... the Mallory.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI'll take the Mallory.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttGood choice.

tFrank blows some dust off the glasses.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttLooks like these got a few years on them.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttThis'll kill 'em.

tJack pours and he and Frank settle on the tiny piano
tbenches.  As Frank swallows, he winces.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJesus.

tIt suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old
tfamiliar place, staring into his glass.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttHow're your hands?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(surprised)
ttOh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple
ttsore knuckles.  Nothing.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYou know, that night, I ... It
ttjust all came up.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah, I know.  Me, too.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttI mean, you can play.  You're
ttokay.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttI can keep the beat.

tJack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses.

<b>ttttFRANK

ttCharlie called.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others.  
ttDonna said even Lloyd called the other day.  
ttNothing like a little absence to make the heart
ttgrow fonder, huh?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttYeah.

tJack and Frank lock eyes again.  
tFrank's glance drops to Jack's glass.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttJesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttFive years ago.
ttt(thinking)
ttNovember.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttRight.  It was someone's birthday.
ttHalloran?

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttDaughter's.  Sweet sixteen.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttChrist, that's right.  How could
ttI forget.  What a nightmare.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttShe asked for it.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI told Halloran we didn't do
ttvocals, but he said:

<b>ttttJACK AND FRANK
</b>ttt(in unison)
ttWhat my Sissy-wants, my Sissy gets.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttShe got it all right.

tJack and Frank glance at one another, little boy
tmischief glowing in their faces.  Suddenly they swivel
ton the pianos and begin to play "You're Sixteen."

<b>ttttJACK AND FRANK
</b>ttt(singing)
ttShe comes on like a dream
ttPeaches and cream
ttLips like strawberry wine
ttShe's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine.
ttRibbons and curls
ttOoh, what a girl
ttEyes that sparkle and shine
ttYou're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.

tAs Jack and Frank finish, they're laughing.  After a
tmoment, their voices die and the house is quiet again.  
tFull of ghosts.  Each stares at the tiny keyboard before
thim, awkward with the intimacy of the moment.  It is
tquiet for a very long time.  Finally, Frank looks over.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWell ... One more time?

tJack glances up and sees Frank has his empty glass
theld out.  He hesitates, then picks up the bottle.

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttOne more time.
