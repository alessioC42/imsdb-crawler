     "He was part of my dream of course 
     but then I was part of his dream too."

<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tINT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM. DAY.
</b>
tA college counselor stands at the Podium lecturing the high
tschool seniors about their future.

<b>ttttCOLLEGE COUNSELOR
</b>tt... For those of you going on to college
ttnext year, the chance of finding a good
ttjob will actually decrease by the time
ttyou graduate. Entry level jobs will drop
ttfrom thirty-one to twenty-six percent,
ttand the median income for those jobs
ttwill go down as well ...

tThere is some rustling in the audience.

<b>ttttCOLLEGE COUNSELOR (CONT)
</b>ttObviously, my friends, it's a
ttcompetitive world and good grades are
ttyour only ticket through. By the year
ttTwo Thousand  ...

<b>tINT. HIGH SCHOOL. HEALTH CLASS.
</b>
tA different teacher lectures a different class of students.

<b>ttttHEALTH TEACHER
</b>tt... The chance of contracting HIV from a
ttpromiscuous lifestyle will climb to one
ttin one hundred and fifty. The odds of
ttdying in an auto accident are only one
ttin twenty-five hundred.
ttt(beat)
ttNow this marks a drastic increase ...

<b>tINT. HIGH SCHOOL. SCIENCE CLASS.
</b>
tSame angle. Different teacher.

<b>ttttSCIENCE TEACHER
</b>tt... From just four years ago when ozone
ttdepletion was at ten percent of its
ttcurrent level. By the time you are
tttwenty years old, average global
tttemperature will have risen two and a
tthalf degrees. Even a shift of one
ttdegree can cause such catastrophic
ttconsequences as typhoons, floods,
ttwidespread drought and famine.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. STUDENTS.
</b>
tThey stare back in stunned silence. One of them, DAVID
tWAGNER, sits in the front row with a pencil in his mouth.
tNobody moves ...

<b>ttttSCIENCE TEACHER
</b>ttt(chipper classroom tone)
ttOkay. Who can tell me what famine is?

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>t1958.
</b>
tBirds are chirping. The sun is shining. All the hedges are
tneatly pruned and the lawns are perfectly manicured. A sweet
tstillness hangs over the SUBURBAN STREET, which is bathed in
tbeautiful BLACK AND WHITE.

<b>ttttMAN'S VOICE (OS)
</b>ttHoney, I'm home.

<b>tSUBURBAN HOME.
</b>
tGEORGE PARKER enters the front door and hangs his hat on the
tcoatrack. He sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer
twith a huge smile on his face. It's a frozen smile that
tdoesn't seem to be affected by too much in particular--like a
ttour guide at Disneyland.

<b>ttttWOMAN'S VOICE (OS)
</b>ttHello darling.

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tMRS. GEORGE PARKER (BETTY) enters, untying the back of her
tapron. She is a vision of '50s beauty with a thin figure and
tconcrete hair. Betty crosses to her husband and hands him a
tfresh martini. She kisses him on the cheek.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttHow was your day?

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttOh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said
ttthat if things keep going the way they
ttare, I might be seeing that promotion
ttsooner than I thought.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttOh darling that's wonderful!
ttt(an adoring gaze)
ttI always knew you could do it.

<b>tWAGNER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
</b>
<b>t1996 -- (LIVING COLOR)
</b>
tDAVID WAGNER sits on his couch watching this entire action on
ta sleek new Sony T.V. He stares riveted at the set with a big
tsmile on his face. David wears black shoes, black pants,
tblack t-shirt and a black baseball cap, not a nerd exactly
t... He reaches next to him into a huge bag of Doritos, never
ttaking his eyes off the show.

<b>ttttGEORGE (OS)
</b>ttt(on T.V.)
ttHey, Pumpkin! What's that smell?
ttt(sniffing)
ttIs that your meat loaf?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(by rote)
tt"It might be ..."

<b>ttttBETTY (OS)
</b>ttt(shy smile)
ttIt might be.

tHe leans over and kisses her--again on the cheek.

<b>ttttGEORGE (OS)
</b>ttOh Pumpkin! You sure know the way to
ttthis man's heart.

tThere is a loud and inappropriate LAUGH TRACK. David smiles
twider and is just about to reach for more corn chips, when
this real MOTHER'S VOICE rings out from the other room.

<b>ttttDAVID'S MOM (OS)
</b>tt... Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the
ttdeal

<b>tINT. KITCHEN.
</b>
tDavid's mom paces the room with the phone in her hand.
tBetween the plastic surgery and the make-up it's hard to fix
ther age.

<b>ttttDAVID'S MOM
</b>ttNo--you have custody the first weekend
ttof every month and this is the first
ttweekend ...
ttt(pause)
ttI don't care if yesterday was the
ttthirtieth, this is still the first
ttweekend.

<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM.
</b>
tHer words drift in from the kitchen while David stares at the
tshow.

<b>ttttDAVID'S MOM (OS)
</b>ttNo I can't bail you out, I'm supposed to
ttgo to La Costa ...
ttt(beat)
ttWell if I want to get a mud bath, that's
ttreally my business, isn't it?

tHe reaches out and TURNS UP THE SOUND. PLEASANTVILLE plays at
tan unnaturally high volume.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttt(on T.V.)
ttHey. Where are those kids?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(reciting--a little louder)
tt"Right behind you father."

<b>ttttBUD AND MARY SUE TOGETHER
</b>ttt(on T.V.)
ttRight behind you father.

<b>tRESUME T.V. (BLACK AND WHITE)
</b>
tThe Parkers' son and daughter (BUD AND MARY SUE) enter the
tfoyer together. Mary Sue wears her hair in a pony tail. Bud
thas on a Letterman's sweater.

<b>ttttMARYSUE
</b>ttMother ... Father ... Bud has a little
ttsurprise for you.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttWhat's that Bud?

tBud hesitates for a moment, then folds up a shiny blue
tribbon.

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttFirst prize at the science fair. There
ttwere lots of swell projects--guess mine
ttwas just the "swellest".

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttDarling that's wonderful. Except there's
ttno such word as "swellest".

<b>ttttBUD
</b>ttWell gee whizz, Mom. lt wasn't the
tt"English" fair.

tThere is another jarring LAUGH TRACK.

<b>tCLOSE UP. DAVID.
</b>
tHe smiles right along with it. David stares transfixed at the
tset despite the continuing conversation in the other room.

<b>ttttDAVID'S MOM (OS)
</b>ttWell sure they can stay by themselves,
ttBarry, but that's not the point. You
ttsaid you'd take them.
ttt(beat)
ttWell fine--they'll stay by themselves
ttthen.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttWhat's a mother to do?

<b>ttttBETTY(OS)
</b>ttt(on T.V.)
ttOh--what's a mother to do?

<b>tCLOSE UP. DAVID.
</b>
tHe grabs another handful of Doritos staring at the T.V ...

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. HIGH SCHOOL. (SERIES OF SHOTS) DAY.
</b>
tA cacophony of modem life. Beepers and nose rings--blue hair
tand tattoos. Dissonant boom boxes compete with one another.
tThe hormones are running crazy.

<b>tSCHOOL COURTYARD.
</b>
tlt is a large open area, alive at lunchtime. Groups of kids
thang out together, divided by their various cliques. The
tmusic pounds in the background.

<b>tCLOSE UP. DAVID.
</b>
tHe stands at one end of the courtyard beside a chain link
tfence. Beads of sweat form on David's forehead as he speaks
tto someone in front of him.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttHi. I mean ...
ttt(pause)
tt... Hi.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE.
</b>
tA very pretty blonde girl smiles back at him. It's a warm,
twelcoming smile.

<b>tCLOSE UP. DAVID.
</b>
<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttLook. You probably don't think I should
ttbe asking you this. I mean--not knowing
ttyou well and all ...

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.
</b>
tShe smiles wider at him, inviting him to continue.

<b>tCLOSE UP. DAVID.
</b>
<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(pause ...)
ttI mean I know you--everybody knows you
tt... I just don't know you ...
tttechnically.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.
</b>
tShe nods at him ...

<b>tCLOSE UP. DAVID.
</b>
<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWell--I was just wondering--'cause I see
ttyou all the time in Algebra and I heard
ttyou humming that Van Halen song and I
ttreally like that song too ...
ttt(pause)
ttAnyhow, I don't know what you're doing
ttthis weekend but my Mom's leaving town
ttand she said I could use her car so ...

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.
</b>
tShe positively beams. The girl flicks her blonde hair and
tstares back at him adoringly.

<b>tCLOSE UP. DAVID.
</b>
tInstead of smiling back, David just stares, then looks at the
tground.

<b>tWIDE ANGLE. SCHOOLYARD.
</b>
tFor the first time WE SEE THAT SHE WASN'T TALKING TO HIM.
tDavid stands a good hundred yards across the schoolyard,
trehearsing this speech while the young woman stands face to
tface with a much cooler boy. He has a cell phone and a very
thip haircut.

<b>tANGLE. DAVID.
</b>
tDavid watches as the girl throws her arm around the boy's
twaist and heads out of the playground ...

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. "LUNCHEON COURT". DAY.
</b>
tDavid and his friends are all gathered around the plastic
tpicnic tables and vending machines that form the luncheon
tcourt. The chess club meets at one end and there are some
tteachers at the other. All the cool kids are on the other
tside of the fence but David and his friends eat lunch at the
tsame table every day.

<b>ttttHOWARD
</b>ttOkay, whose window did Bud break when he
ttwas playing with his father's golf
ttclubs?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttEasy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr.
ttJenkins have?

tHoward looks at him, puzzled.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttSalesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name
ttthe cat they found in the gutter?

<b>ttttHOWARD
</b>ttScout?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttMarmalade.

tThey all nod--and murmur with admiration.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttOkay--here's one: Why did their parents
ttcome home early from their weekend at
ttthe lake?

tEverybody thinks.

tNobody knows.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>tt'Cause Bud didn't answer the phone and
ttthey were worried about him.

tIt's quiet for a beat.

<b>ttttHOWARD
</b>ttYou're unbelievable. You'll win this
ttthing for sure. When is it on?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttMarathon starts at 6:30. Contest's
tttomorrow at noon.

<b>ttttHOWARD
</b>ttt(weighing it)
ttA thousand dollars ... And it's on all
ttnight?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOf course it is Howard. That's why they
ttcall it a Marathon.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.
</b>
tDavid's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the
tparking lot. All the girls are dressed in the exact same
tuniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white V-neck T
tshirt, car keys in their hand. (Even the girls WITHOUT a car
thold car keys in their hand). Jennifer is by far the
tprettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. They all
tlook toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends
tare hanging out.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>ttOmigod, it's so mortifying, being
ttrelated to him. I can't believe you're
ttlike--

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttOnly on my parent's side.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>ttI know, but you're like ... twins and
ttstuff.
ttt(beat)
ttYou must be from like, the cool side of
ttthe uterus.

tA group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They
tbop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen
tyear olds. The girls freeze when they see them.

<b>ttttKIMMY (CONT)
</b>ttOmigod, omigod--here they come.

<b>ttttCHRISTIN
</b>ttDon't do anything. Just don't like--do
ttanything ...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(cooly)
ttHi Mark.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE.
</b>
tHe pauses then looks over at her. Jennifer slides sinuously
toff the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young
tracehorse. She has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole
tparking lot knows it. Mark heads over to her, followed by his
tlackies. The two groups meet at the tail-gate of the Nissan
tPathfinder like a small summit conference.

<b>ttttMARK
</b>ttt(to Jennifer)
ttHey.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(right back)
ttHey.

tBeat ...

<b>ttttMARK'S LACKEYS
</b>ttt(to Jennifer's lackies)
ttHey.

<b>ttttJENNIFER'S LACKEYS
</b>ttt(back to them)
ttHey.

<b>ttttMARK
</b>ttSaw you at the mall yesterday.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttYeah ... Saw you too.

tEveryone nods for a moment or two. No one says anything.

<b>ttttJENNIFER (CONT)
</b>ttSo you watching Pearl Jam on MTV
tttonight?

<b>ttttMARK
</b>ttYeah.
ttt(beat)

tJennifer pauses, weighing the next statement.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttMy mom'll be out of town.

tKimmy and Christin positively GASP while Mark's Lackeys
tmumble and glance around. The import of the thing isn't lost
ton anybody. Mark bobs up and down a little faster.

<b>ttttMARK
</b>ttSo uh ... Maybe we could uh ...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttCool.

<b>ttttMARK
</b>ttt(nodding faster)
ttCool.

<b>ttttVARIOUS LACKEYS
</b>ttCool.

tEverybody bobs and shuffles for x94 beat, when Mark nods,
tsummoning his flock.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. WAGNER HOUSE. DUSK.
</b>
tlt is a south-westem version of "Leave it to Beaver." The
tuniformity of Suburbia has been washed in earth tones. There
tis a red tile roof gracing every home. All the houses have
tthe same anemic palm tree. It's a urban planner's version of
thell.

<b>ttttJENNIFER (VO)
</b>tt... I know, I know--He's just like so
ttFINE ... I'm still like: "Omigod."

<b>tINT. WAGNER HOME.
</b>
tlt is just as sleek and impersonal as before. Maybe more so
tat night. Jennifer crosses through the living room with the
tcordless phone attached to her ear.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttIt was amazing, Daph ... I'm like:
tt"Well my Mom'll be out of town." And
tthe's like "Well then, maybe we could--
ttyou know ..." And I'm like "Yeah, sure."
ttAnd he's like "Well, cool."
ttt(beat)
ttI know, he's just so smart.
ttt(pause ...)
ttI don't know. Maybe that black thing I
ttjust got.
ttt(pause ...)
ttIt is not slutty, Daph, it's cute.
ttt(pause ... )
ttWell, "hello?" He's not coming  over
tthere to study ...
ttt(beat)
ttI know. Well I'm jealous of you too
ttsometimes.

<b>tINT. DAVID'S BEDROOM.
</b>
tlt is studious and academic--not joyless, but not colorful
teither. David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside
twith a cordless phone in his hand.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>tt... He's not homeless Howard, they just
ttdon't say where he lives.
ttt(pause ...)
ttWell it's a silly question.
ttt(pause ...)
ttBecause nobody's homeless in
ttPleasantville.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.
</b>
tHis mother loads the final Louis Vuitton bag into her
tMercedes.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>tt... because that's just not what it's
ttlike.

tShe fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway...

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttListen Howard--it's almost six-thirty.
ttI gotta go.

<b>tINT. WAGNER LIVING ROOM.
</b>
tThe huge black TV sits like a monolith in the middle of the
troom. All at once David comes bounding down the stairs making
ta B-Iine for the couch. Jennifer enters just as quickly from
tthe other direction, fiddling with her clothes.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE.
</b>
tThey hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at
texactly the same moment. Both of them freeze then look up at
teach other in shock.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(stunned)
ttWhat are you doing?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhat are you doing?

tNeither one moves. They clutch the remote together.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttDavid, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna
ttlike be here in five minutes.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWell great. The Pleasantville Marathon
ttstarts at six thirty.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttPleasantville Marathon?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(almost reverently)
ttYeah. Every episode ever.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(getting hysterical)
ttOmigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's
ttgonna like beeeee here!

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWeil great. You can watch TV upstairs.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttUpstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any
<b>ttSTEREO!
</b>
tJennifer gets panicked and yanks at the remote. David yanks
tback and before they know it, the remote goes flying out of
ttheir hands, CRASHING onto the hardwood floor. lt smashes
tinto a million tiny pieces.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(breathless)
ttOh my God ...
ttt(sinking to his knees/
tttscooping up the remains)
ttOh my God ...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttDavid, stop stressing, you can like--
ttturn it on normally ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttNo you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It
ttdoesn't work without a remote.

tDavid cradles the pieces like a fallen comrade, when the
tDOORBELL RINGS behind him.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttOh my God! He's here!

tJennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa
tand tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door. David
tjust stares in shock at the shattered plastic. Jennifer
treaches the front door and wets her lips. She fluffs her hair
tquickly, sticks out her chest then swings it open.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE. FRONT DOOR.
</b>
tJennifer steps forward with her sexiest smile, but it isn't
tMark Davis on the other side. DICK VAN DYKE STANDS ACROSS THE
tTHRESHOLD IN A TV REPAIRMAN'S OUTFIT. Jennifer looks at him
tpuzzled. He steps forward, flashing her a chipper grin,
ttoolbox in hand.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttTV repair.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(beat)
ttTV repair?

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttYeah. TV busted?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(pause ...)
ttYeah ...

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttt(smiling wider)
ttWell here I am.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. DAVID'S POV.
</b>
tHe glances out the front door toward a weird VAN parked at
tthe curb. It says TV REPAIR on the side but looks like
tsomething from a medicine show. The antenna on top resembles
ta weather vane and the mural beneath it depicts a happy
tfamily from the 1950s, gathered around their TV set. Everyone
twears a smile, including the dog. The hand-painted motto
treads "Rob's TV Repair--WE'LL FIX YOU FOR GOOD."

<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM.
</b>
tDavid looks back at Dick Van Dyke who smiles at him, then
tcrosses to the living room STEPPING NIMBLY AROUND THE
tOTTOMAN. He heads toward the TV.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttt(seeing the smashed remote)
ttHoly cow. Look at that. Had a little
ttdisaster didn't ya fella.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttYeah ... Sort of ...

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttt(setting down the toolbox)
ttWe'll get you fixed up in no time.

tHe pops the top of the tool box while Jennifer and David just
tstare. It's a strange looking box with the same happy family
tpainted on the side. Dick Van Dyke pulls out another remote.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
</b>ttI know how I'd feel if mine went out.
ttAlmost like losing a friend.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(tentatively)
ttYou know, we didn't call any TV repair.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttWell that makes it a lucky day for both
ttof us, hunh?

tJennifer shuts the door and crosses down toward the living
troom.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttYou think you could do this like soon?
ttIt's almost six thirty.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttWhat's the rush?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(cutting her off)
ttThe Pleasantville Marathon starts at six
ttthirty.

tAt that moment there is a huge FORK OF LIGHTNING and a
tbooming CLAP OF THUNDER. It literally rattles the walls of
tthe house as Dick Van Dyke turns toward David.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttPleasantville?

tDavid recoils slightly. Dick Van Dyke flashes him a smile.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
</b>ttGosh, I loved that show. Watched it for
ttyears.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttThat's not the reason. I've got a date
ttat six thirty.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttt(ignoring her/
tttleaning closer to David)
ttHey--who did Muff in take to the
ttmasquerade ball when her date came down
ttwith the measles?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(stunned)
tt... Her father.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttRight. And how did she dress him?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(still staring)
tt... Like Prince Charming.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttt(studying David/
tttnodding)
ttNice ... Nice ...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttUm--hello? I've got like a social
ttemergency here.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttt(ignoring her)
ttRemember the one where Bud lost his
ttcousin when he was s'posed to be
ttwatching him?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttYeah ...

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttWhat department store did they go to?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttMcIntire's.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttMcGinty's.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttNo. McIntire's. Remember:
ttt(sings)
tt"For the very best in men's attire,
ttHead right down to McIntire's."

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttt(stunned)
ttThat's right.

tHe stares at David, speechless, for a moment, then smiles
tfondly and reaches beside him for his tool kit.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
</b>ttSay--why don't you take this remote
ttinstead. It's got a little more "Ooomph"
ttin it.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOoomph?

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttSure. Big beautiful set like this--you
ttwant something that'll put you right in
ttthe show.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(quickly)
ttWe'll take it.

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tHe flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking
tcontraption that seems more primitive than space age. It's a
tstrange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash
tGordon ray gun. Dick Van Dyke extends it with pride, while
tJennifer and David stare at him warily ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(beat)
ttHow much does it cost?

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttOh--couldn't charge you for something
ttlike that. It's free.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttFree?

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttOh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the
ttleast I could do.

tThere is a SECOND CLAP OF THUNDER even louder than the first.
tThe house rattles for a moment then is quiet.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
</b>ttWell, I better get going. Your show's
ttalmost on, and ...
ttt(smiling at Jennifer)
ttIt's almost time for your date.

tHe places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and
tsmiles at them. Dick starts across the living room when he
tsuddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and
ttumbles end over end. He rolls on the carpet, executes a
tperfect somersault and comes right back to a standing
tposition. David and Jennifer stare at him stunned when he

tThere is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the
tdoorknob. David and Jennifer look at one another while the
tfront door shuts with a THUD. It's quiet for a second or two
tbefore there is another CLAP OF THUNDER. David cocks his
thead.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE.
</b>
tDavid glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the
tcoffee table. It looks a little scary. Slowly, very slowy, he
treaches down and touches it. Nothing seems to happen so he
tpicks it up.

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tDavid points the remote toward the TV set with an
tapprehensive look on his face. He winces a little, then
tpushes one of the buttons.

tThe TV set turns on. Oprah's face fills the screen as an

tthe channel changes.

tfor the remote.

</b>ttLemme see that.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttNo way.

tHe continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on
tthe Pleasantville Marathon.

tBUD'S VOICE fills the room.

ttGee whizz, Mary Sue--why can't I borrow

tBud and Mary Sue clutch either end of a small transistor

tShe tugs the remote while David yanks in the other direction.

</b>
<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE. SPECIAL EFFECT.
</b>
tA huge white light emanates from the contraption, like their

tBLINDING AURA for a second or two, before it actually gets
tsucked into the TV.

tIt is suddenly empty--illuminated only by the soft glow of
tthe picture tube. David and Jennifer are nowhere in sight.

tDavid and Jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's

tstill clutch the remote control in the exact same position
tthat was occupied by their fictional counterparts. David and

</b>ttI'm not sure.

tGeorge Parker (Bud and Mary Sue's father) enters from the

twith a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots.

</b>ttt(as if to his own children)

</b>ttPsst! Over here.

</b>
tThey whirl around to see DICK VAN DYKE'S FACE smiling at them
tfrom the TV set in the comer. It's an old '50s set with a big

tAll at once the scene on the TV changes and Dick Van Dyke's
tpicture gives way to a WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the WAGNER HOUSE.
tMark Davis is standing at the front door, BANGING on the
tbrass knocker. He checks his watch, shifts restlessly for a

tnever looking back.

tDick Van Dyke shakes his head and walks out of the shot as
tthe screen goes completely BLACK. It cuts out entirely as
tJennifer and David just stare. David grabs the remote and
tstarts rapidly pushing buttons.

tNothing happens.

ttOh God.

tBetty (their "mother") sticks her head into the living room
twearing her black and white apron. She has a great big
tPepsodent smile.

tThey just stare at her.

tThey exchange a strange little glance then slowly rise to
ttheir feet. Jennifer waits for David who forces a smile then
tstarts toward the kitchen.

<b>tINT. KITCHEN.
</b>
tDavid and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they
tsuddenly freeze--agape at the spectacle in front of them:

<b>tTHEIR POV. PARKER KITCHEN.
</b>
tEvery breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table.
tThere are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs.
tPitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham.
tThe table literally sags under the weight of the food. George
tParker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttt(once again)
ttMorning kids. Better get a move on or
ttyou're going to be late for school.

tThey nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room. Bright
tsunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle
tsymphony of songbirds sings outside. David and Jennifer stare
tstraight ahead as their "mother" adds some waffles to the
theap.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(under his breath)
ttI don't believe this.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttNeither do I.

ttI put blueberries in them just the way

</b>ttActually--I'm not real ... hungry.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(big smile)
ttOh nonsense young lady. You're going to

tShe takes Jennifer by the shoulders and "guides" her into the
tchair. Jennifer looks down at a huge plate of GRAY WAFFLES.

tBetty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge
tslab of butter.

<b>ttttBETTY (CONT)
</b>tt... And of course, a nice big bowl of
ttoatmeal.

tJennifer hesitates then glances over at her "mother" who
tlooks at her expectantly. She glances at David who just looks
tstunned. Jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a
tforkful of the oozing mess ...

</b>tt"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty. Tooty Fruity

tHe CONTINUES his homogenized version of Little Richard's

tThe MUSIC CONTINUES as the CAMERA CUTS TO image after image
tof this strange "Utopia." The effect is a weird, sanitizied
tversion of MTV--as if Ronald Reagan had shot a music video.
tThere are men tipping their hats and women walking their
tdogs; cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen.

<b>ttttPAT BOONE (VO)
</b>ttt(slowly ...)
tt"... A wap bop a loo bop--a wap barn boom."

tJen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror
tstarts to dawn on her. At that moment, they hear a screaming
tSIREN and a bright GRAY FIRE ENGINE comes racing up the
tblock.

tJennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come
tflying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE. (FOLLOWING THE FIREMEN)

tThey work in perfect precision. Two firemen grab the base of
tthe ladder while a third takes the front. They go tearing
tacross one of the lawns, in full "emergency response"
tanchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a
ttree.

<b>ttttFIREMAN
</b>ttC'mere, kitty ...

tHe emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the
ttree. Jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by
tthem, petting it gently as he goes.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttOh God, we are. We're stuck in like

tHe stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his

ta little surprised.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWow.

tHe stares at the backboard slightly intrigued. David
tretrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it
tup blind. The ball sails through the hoop again, HITTING
<b>tNOTHING BUT NET.
</b>
<b>tFULL SHOT. OTHER SIDE OF THE GYM.
</b>
tTen to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the
thoop. ALL OF THE SHOTS SAIL THROUGH THE HOOP, NONE EVEN

tclaps his hands.

</b>ttThat's it men. Keep it up. Big game

</b>
tHe gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely.
tDavid flings the ball wildly over his shoulder. It bounces
toff all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as
tsmoothly as the others. He stares in amazement.

<b>tINT. CORRIDOR. LATER ...
</b>
tDavid stands off to the side with his sister, while class
tpours out around them.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttNo way.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOne date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If
ttyou don't go out with this guy we could
ttthrow their whole universe out of whack.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttIt's too weird David. This place is
ttgiving me the creeps. Did you know all
ttthe books are blank?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttI looked in the library. They got covers
ttwith nothing inside them.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhat were you doing in a library?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttI got lost.
ttt(beat)
ttOh here ... look at this!

tShe reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches.
tJennifer tries to light a Kleenex on fire.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b><b>ttJENNIFER!
</b>
<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttJust watch. You know why those guys just
ttget cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing
ttburns around here, that's why! They
ttdon't need any firemen ...

tSure enough the tissue has become flame retardant.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttJen, listen ...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(trembling)
ttI like--really need a cigarette, too.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(putting his arm around her)
ttI'll get us out of here. I really will.
ttBut if we don't play along we could
ttalter their whole existence. We may
ttnever get home.

tShe looks over at him, slowly.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttYou really think anybody's gonna, like,
ttnotice if I don't have a chocolate malt
ttwith this guy.

tAt that moment, three of Mary Sue's "friends" come tittering
taround the comer. They skitter up to her like a group of
twind-up toys.

<b>ttttPEGGY JANE
</b>ttt(high-pitched--rapid fire)
ttYou won't believe what we just heard.

<b>ttttLISA ANNE
</b>ttBiff Martin's going to ask you out.

<b>ttttBETTY JEAN
</b>ttAnd that's not all ...

<b>ttttPEGGY JANE
</b>ttNo, that's not all ...

<b>ttttALL THREE TOGETHER
</b>ttHe's going to give you his pin!

tThey explode in a torrent of TITTERS all over again. Jennifer
tlooks over at David.

<b>tEXT. PARKER HOUSE. DUSK.
</b>
tA lone streetlamp glows in the foreground. Jennifer's voice
tplays OS.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttYou sure I'm supposed to wear this?

<b>tINT. MARY SUE'S ROOM.
</b>
tJennifer emerges from the closet in a mohair sweater and a
tpoodle skirt. Under the sweater she wears a 1950's "bullet
tbra" that turn her breasts into lethal weapons.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(looking in the mirror)
ttI could like kill a guy with these
ttthings.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt's in your closet.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(examining her profile)
ttI've worn some kinky stuff before ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttHe won't notice anyway.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttThey don't notice that kind of thing.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttSo what's the point?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttJen please ...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttHe-llo? I've got like three pounds of
ttunderwire here ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttJust go with the program--hunh? I'm late
ttfor work.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. SODA SHOP. DUSK.
</b>
tThe flashing neon ice cream cone looks good enough to drink.
tUnderneath it, the swirling script spells "SODA SHOP". Johnny
tMathis drifts out into the evening air ...

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tDavid comes sprinting up to the screen door and pauses to get
this breath. He adjusts a little soda jerk's hat, then plunges
tinside.

<b>tINT. SODA SHOP.
</b>
tMr. Johnson, the owner and proprietor is wiping down the
tcounter. He is a "pleasant" looking man, in his early forties
twearing a white apron and black glasses. The strains of
t"MISTY" get louder as Bud lets the screen door slam behind
thim.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttt(looking up)
ttBud?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttSorry ... I had to help my folks and
ttthen I couldn't find my hat ...

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttOh.

tHe stops wiping for a moment, holding the towel in his hand.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (CONT)
</b>ttI didn't know what to do.

tHe stares at the rag a little troubled.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhat's wrong?

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttWell--I always wipe down the counter and
ttthen you set out the napkins and glasses
ttand then I make the french fries ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(confused)
ttYeah ...

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttBut you didn't come so I kept on wiping.

tHe looks down at the towel clearly disturbed. David pauses
tfor a moment then starts toward him.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI'm sorry.

tHe crosses to Mr. Johnson who has polished one section of the
tcounter right down to the wood. David takes the towel out of
this hand and folds it neatly in front of him.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttt(gently)
ttYou know, if this ever happens again,
ttyou can make the fries even if I haven't
ttput out the napkins yet.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttI'm so glad you're here.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI understand.

<b>tEXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.
</b>
tBiff's convertible rolls up to the curb with Pat Boone
tplaying on the radio. He runs a comb through his short blonde
thair before grabbing the bouquet of flowers next to him and
theading up the walk. Biff rings the doorbell and, a moment
tlater, Jennifer's silhouette appears in the doorway ...

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttOh. Mary Sue ...

<b>tEXT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.
</b>
tThe place is really hopping now. All the spots in the parking
tlot are filled with vintage "jalopies" and several patrons
tare streaming through the door. The SAME JOHNNY MATHIS SONG
tis still PLAYING on the juke box, and the neon ice cream soda
tsign blinks against the sky.

<b>tINT. SODA SHOP.
</b>
tDavid is trapped behind the counter, furiously working to
tkeep up with the load. Several clean cut teenagers pepper him
twith orders while he yanks at the pumps and spiggots. It's
tclear he isn't used to this.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(frazzled)
ttPeppermint shake, chocolate soda, two
ttorders of fries and a split?

<b>ttttTEEN AGE GIRL
</b>ttPeppermint soda, two chocolate shakes,
ttorder of fries, and we'll split it.

tDavid nods quickly, wiping some sweat from his brow. He
tscoops some ice cream into the metal blender as Mr. Johnson
tcomes up beside him.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttThere aren't any cheeseburgers.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(turning)
ttWhat?

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttWell, usually I put out the burger and
ttthen you finish with the lettuce ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttListen to me!

tMr. Johnson recoils slightly.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttDo you have the lettuce?

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>tt... Yeah.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttHave you cooked the burgers?

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttt(quieter)
ttYes.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWell you can just put on the lettuce,
ttfinish the burger and pretend it was me
ttdoing it all along.

tMr. Johnson stares at him.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttReally. It's fine.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE. SODA SHOP ENTRANCE.
</b>
tThe screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a
tLetterman's sweater. A moment later, Jennifer sashays
tthrough, parading her new Jane Russell profile. Her
t"girlfriends" TITTER from the comer as Biff rushes up to a
ttable, and pulls out a chair. She sashays into it, brushing
tagainst him as she goes.

<b>tANGLE. DAVID.
</b>
tHe stares motionless at the spectacle--concerned and
tapprehensive. David holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda
tspiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all
tover his chest.

<b>tFULL SHOT. TABLE.
</b>
tBiff stares across the table at Jennifer with the wholesome
tdevotion of a labrador retriever. He looks like a cross
tbetween Troy Donahue and a mannequin.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttt(haltingly)
ttI sure am glad you said you'd come out
ttwith me tonight Mary Sue.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(full blown "Mary Sue")
ttWell "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad
ttyou asked me.

tHe guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttI don't know if I ever said this to you
ttbefore, but, well ... I think you're
ttjust about the keenest girl in the whole
ttschool ...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttReally Biff? The keenest?

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttOh yeah.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(all sarcasm)
ttGosh. I hardly know what to say.

<b>ttttDAVID (OS)
</b>ttWhat can I get you two?

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tHe stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper
tand a pencil. Jennifer looks up at her brother and almost
tbursts out laughing. He wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty
tangle with large white apron tied around his neck.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttOh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my
ttusual cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

tMore goony laughs. David turns to Jennifer who puts on the
tsame dopey countenance.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttOh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a
ttsalad and an Evian Water.

tHe shoots her a dirty look. Jennifer just smiles at him.

<b>ttttJENNIFER (CONT)
</b>ttCheeseburger it is.

<b>tANGLE. FOLLOWING DAVID.
</b>
tHe glowers at her all the way back to the counter. David
tposts the order in the little carousel clip board, keeping an
teye on the table the entire time ...

<b>tRESUME. TABLE.
</b>
tBiff gazes across the table at Jennifer with an adoring look
ton his face. His hands are properly folded in front of him.
tShe's still trying to do her best "Mary Sue."

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttSee the whole time we were in civics
tttogether, I really wanted to sit next to
ttyou--but you were always sitting between
ttPeggy Jane and Lisa Anne.

tThere is some TITTERING behind her. Jennifer doesn't respond.

<b>ttttBIFF (CONT)
</b>tt... And you always seemed so smart and
tteverything. Like that report you did on
tt"Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know
ttwhat I'd talk to you about.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttWell, sometimes talking's over-rated.
ttDon't you think?

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttHunh?
ttt(goony laugh)
ttOh, right ...

tHe still doesn't understand. Biff GUFFAWS for a moment or two
tthen glances down at the table top. There is a momentary
tbreak in the Music as Johnny Mathis' "MISTY" starts up all
tover again. It's enough to make you shoot yourself.

<b>ttttBIFF (CONT)
</b>ttSo I know I haven't been steady with
ttanybody, but I just don't want to rush
ttit. You don't want to make a mistake
ttwith something that important.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttOh, gosh no.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttI mean, there's kids that are even
ttholding hands already but I figure
ttthere's plenty of time for that kind of
ttthing later on. Don't you?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttOh you bet.
ttt(beat)
ttWill you excuse me for a sec?

tJennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom.

<b>tANGLE. DAVID.
</b>
tHe freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister
tpractically stumbles through the bathroom door.

<b>tINT. BATHROOM.
</b>
tOf course there aren't any toilets. Jennifer gropes her way
tto the sink and leans against the counter.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttJesus Chirist ...

tShe turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a
tdumbstruck look on her face. Jennifer shakes her head for a
tmoment or two, when the door to the bathroom bursts open.

<b>ttttGIRL'S VOICES
</b>ttt(overlapping)
tt"Did he give it to you ... Did he give
ttit to you ... I bet he gave it to her
tt... Did he give it to you?"

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(straight ahead)
ttI don't think he knows how.

tThey TITTER away, even though they don't get it either. It
tsounds like an aviary.

<b>ttttLISA ANNE
</b>ttI bet he's gonna take her to Lover's
ttLane.

<b>ttttPEGGY JANE
</b>ttI bet he is. I bet he is.

<b>ttttBETTY JEAN
</b>ttI bet he's even gonna hold her hand!

tThey TITTER some more as Jennifer shakes her head.

<b>tINT. SODA SHOP.
</b>
tDavid is standing beside their table as she retums from the
tbathroom.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(chipper)
ttCouple of cheeseburgers and two cherry
ttcokes.
ttt(pointedly)
ttIf you need anything, I'll be right over
ttthere.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(Mary Sue)
ttGee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly
ttneed when we have each other?

tShe flashes him a "sweet" smile then reaches out and TOUCHES
tBIFF'S HAND. Both boys jump slightly as Jennifer gives her
tbrother a venomous grin then suddenly waves "bye bye." David
tjust stares at her panicked as he moves haltingly back to the
tSoda fountain.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttt(befuddled)
ttAnyhow ... I really wanted to come over
ttand sit next to you in civics but ...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttYou want to get out of here?

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttYou wanna get out of here? You wanna
ttleave?

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttt(confused)
ttBut where would we go?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(shrugging)
tt... Lover's Lane.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttt(swallow)
ttLover's Lane!

tThere is an audible GASP from the booth behind them. Jennifer
tignores it.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttYeah. Lover's Lane. You up for it?

<b>tCLOSE UP. BIFF.
</b>
tHe just stares at her with his mouth open ...

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tJennifer reaches forward grabbing his hand.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttC'mon. Let's go.

<b>tFULL SHOT. SODA FOUNTAIN.
</b>
tDavid is in the middle of making a hot fudge sundae when he
tsees Jennifer leading Biff by the hand into the parking lot.
tEveryone at the counter is enjoying their dessert, when David
tlets out a blood curdling scream.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b><b>ttNOOOOOO!
</b>
tHe vaults over the counter making a bee-line for the door.
tEveryone turns and stares as he races toward the entrance ...

<b>tEXT. SODA SHOP.
</b>
tBiff's car is just pulling onto the street when David sprints
tinto the parking lot. He takes off after the car, sprinting
tdown the street.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b><b>ttYOU CAN'T DO THIS JENNIFER! HE DOESN'T
</b><b>ttEXIST! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO SOMEONE WHO
</b><b>ttDOESN'T EXIST!
</b>
tThe tail lights recede in the distance as David slows to a
tjog and then finally a walk. He pauses, winded, in the
tstreet, then looks up toward Heaven with a pissed off look on
this face.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttt(to God)
ttThanks a lot.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.
</b>
tIt is a beautiful tree-lined pond with a lush willow tree in
tthe foreground. The moonlight glistens silver across the
twater. Several cars are parked in a row with their occupants
tHOLDING HANDS. Biff's convertible is parked at the end.

<b>tSHOT. BIFF'S CAR.
</b>
tHe sits stiffly at the wheel staring straight ahead. Jennifer
tis draped languidly across the seat beside him, making the
tmost of her mohair sweater. She stares at Biff in a not-so-
tPleasantville-kind-of-way. He glances over at her and
tswallows.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttSure is pretty.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(staring at him)
ttOh yeah ... Gorgeous.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttTo be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think
ttyou'd want to come here until we'd been
ttpinned for a little while.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttOh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you
ttwant to.

tShe leans back a liftle more, draping her arm across the top
tof the seat. Her tits point toward the sky.

<b>ttttJENNIFER (CONT)
</b>ttt(breathy)
ttOr maybe I should just "pin" you.

tHe looks over at her a little confused, then breaks into his
tgoony laugh.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttOh, that's silly Mary Sue. How could you
ttpossibly pin me?

<b>tCLOSE UP. BIFF.
</b>
tHe is still guffawing when he looks over at Jennifer and
tsuddenly freezes. Biff's eyes widen ...

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.
</b>
tDavid comes sprinting up to the porch, then doubles over
tcatching his breath. He clings onto the porch swing when the
tdoor opens behind him.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttBud?

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tHis "mother" and "father" come out onto the porch. David
tcatches his breath then forces a smile.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttSon, what's wrong?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttHave you seen Mary Sue?

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttWhy no. She's still on her date with
ttBiff ... is something the matter?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(still panting a little)
ttNo, I ... I was just ... worried about
tther.

tHis mother and father exchange a "knowing" look. George rests
ta hand on his shoulder.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttt(oppressively paternal)
ttBud, your sister's a little older now
ttand she's naturally going to start going
ttout with boys.
ttt(beat)
tt... In fact pretty soon--she's even
ttgoing to get married and make someone a
ttgood little home-maker like your mother
tthere.
ttt(smiles at Betty/

ttThat's IF she can learn to bake.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttOh, George ...

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttBut your sister is a fine young woman
ttand she would never do anything for us
ttto be concerned about.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.
</b>
tThe low gutteral MOANS of two coupling animals drifts out
tover the evening air. It is raw and primitive and desperate.
tThe CAMERA begins to TRACK behind all the other cars--their
toccupants primly holding hands in a tender sillouhette. It
tfinally COMES TO REST on a convertible at the end, with a
tgirl's leg sticking out the window.

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tA Letterman's sweater hangs over the door. The windshield is
tcompletely fogged. Jennifer's sweater is draped over the
tbackseat. The car is rocking.

<b>tINT. CAR.
</b>
tThey are clenched in a mad embrace: all arms and hair. Biff
tpulls back for a moment, GASPING for air. His face is covered
twith lipstick and there is a crazy look in his eye. He's
tstuck somewhere between passion and fear as he clings
tdesperately to the steering wheel.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttt(some terror)
ttI think I better go home now Mary Sue ...

tShe holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard.

<b>ttttJENNIFER

</b>ttt(more terror)
ttI think ... I might be ill ...

tHe glances down at his lap a little confused.

</b>ttt(a whisper)
ttI think something's happening to me.

tHe looks at his crotch then back at Jennifer. She reaches up
tand grabs a handful of his hair.

</b>ttIt's s'posed to happen, Biff.

<b>ttttBETTY (OS)
</b>ttDo you want some more cookies?

tDavid is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his

ttOh no ... I'm fine.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttHow 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?

tThere is a knock behind them at the door. David springs up.

</b>ttNow who could that be.

<b>tFOLLOWING DAVID.

tHe crosses into the foyer ahead of his "parents." David
tswings open the door revealing Mr. Johnson, standing on the

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOh hi!

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttHi there. You took off so quick. I
ttwasn't sure if you were okay.

</b>ttt(proud)
ttWell you weren't around this time so I

tMr. Johnson has a strange look of "manly pride" on his face.
tHis shoulders square back. His chest puffs out a little.
tThere is a sudden sparkle in his eye.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttt(more confidential)
ttNot only that, I didn't even do it in

tbehind him.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (CONT)
</b>ttOh, hello Betty.

tNeither one says anything but neither one has to. David looks

this new found virility.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(quickly)
ttWell, look, thanks for coming by. I ...

</b>ttWell gee thanks Biff. I had a really

tHe sits behind the wheel with a totally dazed look on his

twith a couple of thousand volts.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>tt... Me too.

tShe leans over and kisses him on the cheek ... Then she bites
this ear lobe, gently, and flashes him a big smile. Biff
tsmiles back.

tThe stunned look turns to one of sheer amazement:

<b>tBIFF'S POV. ROSE.

tthrough the channels. He flips the dial frantically. No sign

tHe gives her a sheepish grin and sighs ...

tIt is the same configuration as earlier. Everyone wears their
tPleasantville "Lions" jerseys, white sneakers and black
tsocks. David enters the Gym a little groggy. He hasn't had
tmuch sleep.

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tHe looks up and stops. David cocks his head to the side,
tstaring across the gym.

<b>tHIS POV. BIFF AND OTHER BOYS.
</b>
tThey are huddled at the far end, each holding a basketball
tunder his arm. Biff is in the center of the group, animatedly
tdescribing something that is holding their RAPT ATTENTION.

<b>tWIDER ANGLE. INCLUDING DAVID.
</b>
<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttOh no ...

tBiff continues his story while they stare at him with their
tmouths open. The Coach blows his whistle.

<b>ttttCOACH
</b>ttCome on men. Let's go. Big game next
ttweek.

tThe huddle breaks up as the basketball players all wander
ttoward the hoop. Ten shots go up at once but NOT ONE COMES
tEVEN CLOSE. Several clang off the rim, a couple hit the edge
tof the backboard. One slams into the side of the gym.
tEveryone stares in disbelief.

</b>ttWell if I don't who will?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttThey're happy like this.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI just don't think we have the right
ttto ...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttDavid, let me tell you something. These
ttpeople don't want to be geeks. They want
ttto be "attractive." They've got a lot of
ttpotential, they just don't know any
ttbetter.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttThey don't have that kind of potential.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttUm--hello? You want to like take a look?

tJennifer motions behind her to a boy and girt who are locked
tin an intimate conversation. The girl wears bobby socks and
tthe boy wears a letterman's sweater, but the conversation is
tsexually charged. They speak to one another in a close
twhisper--their faces inches apart. All at once the girt gets
tshy and glances away. She blows a big bubble with her gum,
tbut the BUBBLE IS BRIGHT PINK IN AN OTHERWISE GRAY FRAME.

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttWow. What kind of gum is that?

<b>tCLOSE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.
</b>

tIt is a typical '50s family practice right out of Norman
tRockwell. There is a jar of tongue depressors on the counter
tand a jar of lollipops beside them. Lisa Anne (Mary Sue's
tbest friend) is being examined by Dr. Henderson. Her mother
tsits at her side.

<b>ttttDR. HENDERSON
</b>ttLet me see it again.

tLisa Anne opens her mouth and sticks out a BRIGHT RED TONGUE.
tEverything else in the frame is Black and White, but her

tA large group of customers is huddled in a circle, staring at

</b>
tHe heads toward work with his apron and his paper hat, but
the's clearly disconcerted. David stops and stares at A BRIGHT
tRED HOT ROD parked at the front door of the restaurant. He
tshakes his head.

<b>tSODA SHOP.
</b>
tThe place has been transformed. What was cheery and benign a
tcouple of days before, has gotten a little bit dangerous. The
tletterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets. The
tPat Boone and Johnny Mathis have given way to real Rock and
tRoll. There is a James Dean/Marlon Brando edge in the air.
tSomebody has played the flip side.

<b>tANGLE. DAVID.
</b>
tHe enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat. A young
tcouple makes out passionately in the doorway--all tongues and
thands. When they break David sees that the girl's cheeks are
tFLUSHED WITH RED. He stares at her for a beat as they return
tto normal. David shakes his head.

<b>tFOLLOWING HIM.
</b>
tHe crosses to the counter and grabs his pencil and little pad
tof paper. Various things have already GONE TO COLOR AROUND
tTHE ROOM: The JUKE BOX ... The COKE SIGN .. THE NAUGAHIDE
tSTOOLS ... David crosses to one of the booths where his
tsister's arm is draped over Biff's shoulder.

</b>ttWhat'll it be?

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttt(still chipper as ever)
ttGee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the

tBud has already written it down. He glances over at his
tsister.

</b>ttMe too. Sounds swell.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(pointed)
ttReally? It seems so fattening.

tBefore she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind

</b>ttTwo cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttt(staring straight ahead)
ttThere aren't any cheeseburgers.

ttLook. I thought we talked about this, I
ttthought we said ...

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttOh--what's the point, Bud?

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tMr. Johnson. looks up at him with a weird kind of emptiness
tin his eyes. David grabs his arm.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttC'mere.

tHe pulls him along the counter toward a little office
tstoreroom in the back. He yanks him inside and shuts the
tdoor.

<b>tINT. STOREROOM.
</b>
tIt is just as cheery as the rest of the place. There is a
tsmall table with a telephone on it. A Texaco calendar shows a
thappy family motoring in their Rambler.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhat did you say?

tMr. Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttWell ... I'm not sure I see the point
ttanymore.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhat are you talking about! You make
tthamburgers! That is the point!

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttNo I know ... I know I do ...
ttt(he pauses, then looks up)
ttBut it's always the same, you know?
ttGrill the bun, flip the meat, melt the
ttcheese ... It never changes. It never
ttgets any better or worse ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttJust listen to me ...

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttt(not hearing him)
tt... Like the other night, when I closed

</b>ttForget about that!

</b>ttOh ... Okay.
ttt(beat/

tt... But I really liked it.

tBud takes a deep breath. He stares at Mr. Johnson, then tries
tto speak softly.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttLook, you can't always like what you do.
ttSometimes you just do it because it's
ttyour job. And even if you don't like it,
ttyou just gotta do it anyway.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(exasperated)
ttSo they can have their hamburgers!

tThis sounds stupid even to David. He shakes his head.

ttYou know what I really like?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(warily)
tt... What's that?

</b>ttSee every year on Dec 3, I get to paint

ttAnd every year, I get to paint a

</b>ttThanks.
ttt(continuing)
ttBut this morning I was thinking about
ttit and I realized that I looked forward
ttto it all year. And then I thought "Gee.
ttThat seems awfully silly. That seems
ttlike an awfully long time to be waiting
ttfor just one moment, don't you think?"

tDavid looks at him speechless.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (CONT)
</b>ttWell don't you?

</b>ttI think you should try not to think

</b>ttOh. Okay. I'll try that then.

tThe Barber Pole spins in three shades of gray. Several men
tare gathered around the two chairs in the front of Gus' shop.
tBesides being the barbershop, it is the bastion of all male
tlife in Pleasantville. Bud and Mary Sue's "father" (George)
tsits in one of the chairs. "Big Bob" McGee, owner of the
tdrugstore, supermarket and Chevy dealership sits in the
tother. He has a crew cut that's getting shorter.

</b>ttHave they ever lost before?

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttBasketball? No they sure haven't.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttJust feels "wrong", that's all.

tThere are several murmurs.

<b>ttttTHIRD PATRON
</b>ttMaybe that's where they get that saying,
tt"can't win 'em all."

<b>ttttGUS
</b>ttYeah. That's a good point, Ralph. They
ttdo have that saying.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttBut they do win 'em all, Gus. They've

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. PARKER KITCHEN. DAY.
</b>
tThe women's bridge club has assembled in the Parker kitchen
tlike it does every Wednesday afternoon. Four women are seated
taround the kitchen table with a nice bowl of bridge mix
tbetween them. Betty is sifting next to Marge Jenkins, the
twoman who accompanied her daughter to the doctor's office.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttt(dealing the cards)
tt... He said it would clear up on its

ttAnd you say it's just "red?"

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttWell--like red, only ... "redder."

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttHunh. I know what you mean. That's like
ttthe front of Bill Johnson's shop. I was

</b>
tShe looks up quickly--then grabs some bridge mix.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttt(lowering her voice)
ttHave you seen him lately? The man
ttdoesn't look like himself. I was
ttgetting my sewing machine fixed across
ttthe street and he was sitting in the
ttwindow of his shop just staring.
ttWasn't looking at anything in
ttparticular--just staring off into space.

<b>ttttMARY
</b>ttThat is strange.

tBetty reaches out and grabs her cards. She fans them out in
tfront of her, when her eyes go wide.

</b>
tThey are ALL HEARTS and all BRIGHT RED. It looks like a
tfistfful of valentines.

</b>
tShe puts the cards down quickly and takes a sudden breath.
tBetty keeps them like that for a moment or two, before
tlifting them up and taking another look.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttBetty, it's your bid.

tShe swallows trying to keep her composure.

</b>ttYeah?

tBetty hesitates. Rinses out a pot.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttCan I ask you a question?

</b>ttSure.

tShe pauses for a long moment.

</b>ttWhat's sex?

tJennifer looks over at her stunned, but Betty just looks at

</b>ttYou sure you want to know this?

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttYes.

tGeorge crosses from the dresser to the TWO TWIN BEDS in the

tbuttoned up to the neck. George puts his glass of warm milk
ton the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed. It is

</b>
tBetty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top
tof her robe. She slips it off, and lets it drop to the floor,
tstanding naked in the middle of the bathroom. Betty glances
ttoward the mirror and then quickly glances away. She takes a
tdeep breath and steps into the tub.

<b>tEVEN TIGHTER. ON HER FACE ...
</b>
tBetty slides down into the warm water, breathing in the
tsteam, and closing her eyes for a moment. She lingers like
tthat for a second or two, before settling a little lower in
tthe tub. Betty opens her eyes, but they only half open. There
tis the slight trace of a smile.

<b>tEXTREME CLOSE UP BETTY'S FACE.

tHer eyes close again as she bites her lower lip gently. The

tThe Fireman nods and does as he is told. David opens the
tvalve sending out a huge FLUME OF WATER.

<b>ttttFIREMAN
</b>ttWhoa!
ttt(beat)
ttSo that's what these do.

tA huge smile breaks out across the fireman's face--like a man
twho has suddenly found his purpose in life. He beams from ear
tto ear dousing the flames, while David runs to get another
those ...

<b>ttttBOB (VO)
</b>ttt(fading in)
tt... In honor and in recognition of
ttyour heroism ...

<b>ttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. TOWN HALL. DAY
</b>
tDavid stands at a podium receiving a commendation from "Big"
tBob McGee (the man from the barbershop). He holds a large
tplaque up for public display, while "David's" whole family
tbeams in the background.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>tt... And with great appreciation from
ttthe citizens of Pleasantville ...

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tA huge crowd is gathered on the town hall steps. There are
tlots of balloons and bunting.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttI am pleased to present You with this
ttspecial commendation, from the
ttPleasantville Chamber of Commerce!

tHe hands the plaque to David as the entire town bursts into
<b>tAPPLAUSE.
</b>
<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET. LATER ...
</b>
tDavid walks away from the center of town looking down at his
tplaque. He takes his sleeve and starts to rub off a smudge
twhen a young woman comes up beside him.

<b>ttttGIRL'S VOICE
</b>ttHi Bud ...

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tShe is MARGARET ANNE HENDERSON, the prettiest girl in school,
tand one of the most popular. Margaret wears a frilly polka
tdot dress, that only accentuates a bombshell '50s figure.
tNonetheless, she seems the image of girly innocence.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttThat was sure swell ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOh. Thanks, Margaret.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttI baked you my oatmeal cookies.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(vaguely remembering an episode)
ttOh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttNo. I baked them for you.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttNo. You baked them for Whitey.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttt(low and gutteral)
ttNo. I baked them for you.

tAll at once, Margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up
tagainst him. Her breasts shove up against his chest. Her
tmouth is inches away from his.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttUm ... thanks.

tDavid can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and
tfreshly baked cookies. He stares into her eyes for a moment,
tunable to speak. Margaret flashes him a not-so Pleasantville
tsmile.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttSee ya.

tShe turns and heads around the comer, while David just
twatches her dumbstruck.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tSODA SHOP. DUSK.
</b>
tDavid heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat.
tThe BUDDY HOLLY music has given way to "hip" '50s JAZZ. DAVE
tBRUBECK drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a
tmoment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside.

<b>tSODA SHOP.
</b>
tThe place has "morphed" even more. If it was a teenage
thangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house
tnow. Brubeck's "TAKE FIVE" plays in the background while
tseveral patrons talk "intensely" in their booths.

<b>tDOORWAY.
</b>
tDavid walks into the building and pauses. Next to him, one of
tthe boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz
ton a BONGO DRUM. There are several COFFEE cups on the table.
tJennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(in a whisper)
ttI had nothing to do with that fire.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttIt's okay.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttNot directly anyhow ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt's fine.

tDavid glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the
tbongos have stopped playing. All the kids are staring up at
thim, with a weird expression of awe.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(still under her breath)
ttUm ... They like wanna ask you a
ttquestion ... I didn't know how to
tthandle it. So ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttSure.

tHe crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at
thim. It's like Elvis has entered the building.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttHow you doin?

<b>ttttVARIOUS KIDS
</b>ttSwell ...

tThey keep on staring. Several glances are exchanged back and
tforth like they're sharing a secret. Finally ...

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttHow'd you know about the fire?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttHow'd you know how to put it out and
ttall?

tDavid hesitates, weighing his words.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWell--where I used to live ...
ttThat's just what firemen did.

tThis sends a MURMUR through the shop. The boy leans forward.

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttAnd where's that?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(carefully)
ttUm ... Outside of Pleasantville.

tThis sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids.
tIt's like electricity. They glance excited at one another. A
thush descends.

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttWhat's outside of Pleasantville?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttLook it doesn't matter. It's not
ttimportant.

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttWhat is it?

tDavid stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on
tevery word.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt's really not important.

<b>ttttGIRL'S VOICE (OS)
</b>ttWhat's outside of Pleasantville?

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING DOORWAY.
</b>
tMargaret Henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the
tdoorway staring at David. She hangs on his words with the
tsame excitement as the others, it just means so much more.

<b>ttttMARGARET (CONT)
</b>ttt(hungry for knowledge)
ttC'mon. Tell us ...

tShe stares right in his eyes. She's ten feet away but might
tas well be touching him.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(slowly)
ttWell ... There are some places where
ttthe road doesn't go in a circle.
ttThere are some places where it keeps
tton going.

tThere's an excited giggle. They lean forward.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttt(an exotic concept)
ttKeeps going ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWell--it all just keeps going.
ttRoads ... rivers ...

<b>tttt2ND BOY
</b>ttt(from the back)
ttLike the "Mighty Mississippi".

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>tt... What?

tHe moves forward extending a book. The cover reads: "THE
tADVENTURES OF HUCKELBERRY FINN." David opens the first page.
tThere is printing inside.

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttt(quoting)
tt"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin'
ttan' goin' as far you could see."

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(turning to Jennifer)
ttI thought the books were blank?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttThey were.

tHe looks over at her.

<b>ttttJENNIFER (CONT)
</b>ttt(quickly)
ttOkay look, this like--wasn't my fault.
ttThey asked me what it was about and I
ttlike didn't remember 'cause we had it
ttback in tenth grade, But I told them
ttwhat I DID remember, and the next
ttthing I knew the pages had filled in.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttThe pages filled in?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttBut like only up to the part about
ttthe raft, because I didn't read any
ttfarther.

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tDavid flips through the book and sure enough only the first
tchapter has print. The pages are blank after that.

<b>tttt2ND BOY 
</b>ttDo you know how it ends?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(hesitating)
ttWell, yeah ... I do.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttt(breathless)
ttSo how does it end?

tShe has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of
tfeet away. It's silent in the soda shop.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWell--see ... they're both running
ttaway--Huck and the slave ... And ...
ttThey go up the river ... But--in
tttrying to get free they sort of see
ttthat they're free already.

tDavid looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book
tthat aren't blank anymore. Rows and rows of FRESH NEW TYPE
tmaterialize in front of him. He turns to the back of the
tbook, that is complete with a COLOR illustration.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttOh my God.

<b>tttt2ND BOY
</b>ttWow!

<b>tttt3RD BOY
</b>ttDo you know this one?

tHe shoves another book in front of David.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttHunh?
ttt(looks down at the book)
ttOh yeah ... Well this is great.
ttt(beat)
ttSee--Holden Caulfield is like this
ttreally lonely kid...

<b>tEXT. PLEASANTVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY. DAY.
</b>
tThe CAMERA PANS down from the "PUBLIC LIBRARY' sign to find
tthe front door. A long line of kids waiting to check out
ttheir books stretches onto the sidewalk ...

<b>tEXTREME WIDE SHOT. LIBRARY. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.
</b>
tSeveral men from the barbershop lean against the wall next to
tthe spinning barber pole. They watch the spectacle for a
tmoment or two, as teenager after teenager exits with an
tarmful of books.

<b>ttttGUS
</b>ttI don't know Phil. It's pretty strange.

<b>ttttPHIL
</b>ttI'll say it's strange. Gettin' stranger.

tBig Bob McGee nods and rubs his hands over his fresh haircut.

<b>ttttPHIL (CONT)
</b>ttI mean goin' up to that lake all the

ttgoing to a library! I mean what's next?

</b>ttOughtta be havin' an ice cream soda.
ttThat's where they oughtta be.

</b>
tFrom the shadows of the Town Hall, up the block, David
twatches the stream of kids emerge with their books. They
tcradle them in their hands like a piece of newfound
ttreasure ...

<b>tINT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
</b>
tGeorge sits on the edge of his Barka Lounger, across the
tcoffee table from "Big" Bob McGee. Even sitting down the man
tis a looming presence. Besides owning the market, auto
tdealership, hardware store, and gas station, he also owns the
tinsurance agency where George works. George sweats into his
tcollar.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttWant some bridge mix?

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttOh, no thanks ...

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttBetty's making some pineapple kabobs ...

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttI'm fine--but thank you.

tGeorge nods as Bob takes a belt of his Martini and leans
tforward.

</b>ttGeorge, you're probably wondering why
ttI asked if I could come over today ...

tGeorge shrugs--then nods--then shrugs ...

tGeorge turns around to see David, standing on the landing,
tlistening to the entire conversation. Their eyes lock for a
tmoment ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI'll get her.

tHe moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him.

<b>tINT. KITCHEN.
</b>
tDavid gets a couple of steps in and stops. He looks across
tthe room to see:

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE.
</b>
tBetty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the
twindow. Her back is to him. She grips the formica kitchen
tcounter.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(approaching slowly)
ttAre you okay?

tShe doesn't answer. David moves up to her and rests a hand on
ther shoulder.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttAre you alright?

tBetty turns around to face him. HER FACE HAS TURNED
<b>tCOMPLETELY TO COLOR. THE EYES ARE GREEN. THE LIPS ARE RED.
</b>tSHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole
tthing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the
ttear stains on either side of her face.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(fighting tears)
ttWhat am I going to do?

tDavid moves closer and looks at her. Her lip is quivering.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt's okay. It's alright.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(trembling)
ttI can't go out there. How can I go out
ttthere?

tShe looks right up at David.

<b>ttttBETTY (CONT)
</b>ttt(quieter)
ttLook at me ...

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE.
</b>
tHe stares at her for a second. Big green eyes full of fear
tand confusion. David pushes a reassuring smile.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttHave you got any make up?

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttIn my handbag.

tHe crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits
tBetty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for
ther compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOkay--first we'll dry you out a little.

tHe dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude,
tThen David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY
tpowder puff.

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tIt is a truly amazing sight. As David smears on the makeup,
tshe returns gradually to BLACK AND WHITE. The skin tones
tdisappear. The flush of her cheeks goes. David takes out a
tDARK GRAY lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. OVER BETTY'S SHOULDER.
</b>
tHe works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back.
tAll at once, David seems to wince:

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. BETTY'S FACE.
</b>
tThe life is gone from her face. In an instant Betty has gone
tfrom three dimensions to two. She stands in front of him, the
tfictional version of herself all over again.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(off his reaction)
ttWhat?

tDavid shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the
tcompact so she can examine herself. Betty holds it up to her
tface, turning her head first right, then left.

<b>ttttBETTY (CONT)
</b>ttt(beat)
ttDoes it look okay?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttLooks just like it did.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttAnd they won't be able to tell?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(even quieter)
ttNo ... They won't be able to tell.

tBetty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the
tplate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before
tshe goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide
t"stewardess" smile ...

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttWait.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(turning back)
ttWhat?

tHe wants to say something, but doesn't. David shakes his
thead.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt's fine.

tShe smiles again and balances the tray in front of her.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttThank you.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(sadly)
ttSure.

tHe watches as she opens the door, and marches in the room,

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

</b>
tMr. Johnson is all alone in the shop, setting up the napkin
tdispensers. He whistles BRUBECK'S "TAKE FIVE" when the screen
tdoor slams behind him. Mr. Johnson looks up with a start.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttOh, hi.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(entering)
ttHi.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttAren't you a little early?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttI brought you something ... From the
ttlibrary.

<b>tCLOSER. FOLLOWING DAVID.
</b>
tHe has a large book tucked under his arm that is easily three
tfeet long. Mr. Johnson looks at him a little intrigued as
tDavid crosses to the counter.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt's an art book.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttOh my Gosh, Bud ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOpen it.

tMr. Johnson reaches out and opens the cover. After a beat,
this eyes widen.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttI just thought since you liked
ttpainting it might help to ...

tMr. Johnson gasps. It's quiet, and subtle, but it's still a
tgasp. David looks over at him but he's lost in the pages.

<b>tHIS POV. (INSERT) ART BOOK ...
</b>
tMassacio's "Expulsion of Adam and Eve' leaps off the pages in
tvibrant, tortured color. The beauty of the garden is offset
tby their agony and their shame. HE TURNS THE PAGE ...

tTitian's "Venus to Utano". Soft, fleshy, in a rich golden
tlight. She is utterly real and entirely nude. The folds of
ther flesh almost seem to glow ...

tRembrandt's "Self Portrait." Dark reds, umbers, blacks and
tbrowns. He looks back at Mr. Johnson with pain and wisdom.
tThere's a brilliant light on his hair.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (OS)
</b>ttMmmmgh ...

tFaintly, almost imperceptibly, the SOUND of a rich ARIA
tbegins to UNDERSCORE THE IMAGES. It's so faint you can't be
tsure you even hear it at all ... like you're hearing it with
tyour eyes.

tHe TURNS THE PAGES faster. Breugal's "Harvesters" ... Tumees
t"Steam Train" ... Monet's "Cathedralo" ... Cezanne's
t"Oranges" ... Mr. Johnson shuts the book.

<b>tWIDER. SODA SHOP.

</b>ttIt's beautiful, Bud ...

tHe looks up at David, troubled.

</b>ttWhat's wrong?

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttI'll never be able to do that.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOh, well--you're just starting out.
ttI mean, you can't do it ...

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttNo, that's not it.

tMr. Johnson shuts the book gently.

twith her books pressed against her chest. She passes the
tdrugstore, then the hardware store ... Far off in the

tpulling off his little paper hat as he goes. He comes running
tup behind her as fast as he can.

tDavid comes flying around the corner in complete jubilation.
tHe vaults over a parking meter, swings around a lampost and
tleaps off the bumper of a parked car. David hi-fives into the
tair at no one in particular and sails over Mr. Simpson's
thedge almost decking him in the process.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(calling back)
ttSorry ...

tHe swttches off the TV sending Dick Van Dyke to electronic

tbreathing hard ...

</b>
tShe sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a
tbook. (It's an alien experience.) Jennifer is just about to
topen it when she senses something and glances toward the
tdoor.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE.

tBud is standing in the doorway just staring at her. He seems
tto be out of breath.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttWhat's wrong?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttNothing.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttNothing?

tHe keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the

</b>ttWell ... I just ...

tShe stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard

tcalculating a math problem. After a moment or two, her
texpression changes: a vague look of recognition.

<b>ttttJENNIFER (CONT)
</b>ttNo, it's not just the sex, is it?

tShe glances down at her book. It's a big book. Jennifer takes
ta deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand. After

tbeat ...

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MARGARET HENDERSON'S HOUSE. (MAPLE STREET) DAY.
</b>
tDavid gets out of his "dad's" convertible, carrying a dozen
t"gray" roses. He takes a deep breath and heads up her front
twalk ...

<b>tINT. CAR. NIGHT. LATER ...
</b>
tDavid sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with Margaret
tHenderson by his side. He concentrates hard on the road,
tholding the wheel at "10 and 2" as he steals a glance to his
tright.

<b>tHIS POV. MARGARET.
</b>
tIt's not quite evening yet, and late afternoon light makes
ther glow. Margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm
twind that swirls inside the convertible ...

<b>tSHOT. DAVID.
</b>
tHe studies her for a moment or two, then suddenly swerves to
tavoid a parked car on his right ...

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tThey pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads:

<b>t"NOW LEAVING PLEASANTVILLE"
</b>
tMain Street turns into a winding country road as they leave
tthe town behind and head off into the woods. They wind
tthrough the dense woodland for a moment or two before a
tsecond sign appears, much like the first:

<b>t"NOW ENTERING PLEASANTVILLE"
</b>
<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.
</b>
tSure enough, the town emerges in front of them again,
tcompleting the 4 dimensional circle. David looks confused.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttUm ... You gotta turn off Main Street.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOh ... Right.

tHe looks over at her and smiles. Margaret turns on the radio.

<b>tEXT. CAR. DUSK.
</b>
tSAM COOKE sings for them as David turns from Main Street onto
ta smaller unmarked lane. The car starts to rise up a small
thill, with Dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road.
tIt continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the
tcrest in the hill. David looks over at Margaret who takes a
tdeep breath shutting her eyes. He glances down at the seat
tbetween them ...

<b>tHIS POV. CAR SEAT.
</b>
tTHE ROSES THAT WERE GRAY HAVE SUDDENLY TURNED TO COLOR. They
tsit next to him on the seat: a deep, rich RED ...

<b>tINT. CAR.
</b>
tDavid looks up and out the windshield. The same thing seems
tto be happening around them ... Many of the Dogwoods have
tstarted to turn PINK. Not all of them, but at least fifty
tpercent of the petals have "bloomed" in some weird false
tspring. The road twists and turns on its way to the top, as
tthey finally reach a crest in the hill.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWow.

<b>tTHEIR POV. LOVERS LANE.
</b>
tThere, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone
tTechnicolor: THE LAKE IS BLUER THAN BLUE. THE WEEPING WILLOW
tIS GREENER THAN GREEN. THE DOGWOOD PETALS (all "turned" now)
<b>tSWIRL IN THE WIND LIKE SOME STRANGE PINK SNOWSTORM. A LONG

</b>
<b>ttttSAM COOKE (VO)
</b>ttt(over the car radios)
tt"Cupid, draw back your bow ..."

<b>tSHOT. CAR.
</b>
tSlowly, David rolls the convertible forward. Many of the kids
thave left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by
tthe edge of the water. A few of them have books open. It
talmost looks "Athenian."

<b>tINT. CAR.
</b>
tDavid looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly
tcocks his head to the side.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhat's that smell?

tMargaret looks at him and smiles. She leans well out of the
tconvertible, and plucks a Gardenia from a bush that is
tblooming beside the car.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttAren't these great?

tDavid takes the flower, then puts it up to his nose. He takes
ta long deep breath then all at once, his posture seems to
trelax. As the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like
tsome strange narcotic is washing over him. David lowers the
tflower ...

<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET. DUSK.
</b>
tBetty is walking down Main Street with a shopping bag on
teither hand. From a block away, she looks like any other
thomemaker in Pleasantville. You don't even notice the gray
tmake-up.

<b>tCLOSER. FOLLOWING BETTY.
</b>
tShe nods to Mrs. Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in
tthe Post Office. Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street
twhen she glances up, and suddenly stops.

<b>tHER POV. ACROSS THE STREET.
</b>
tThere, in the middle of the block, sits Mr. Johnson's soda
tshop. The whole scene is still black and white, except for
tthe large CUBIST PAINTING THAT FILLS MR. JOHNSON'S WINDOW. It
tis rendered in bright PINKS, YELLOWS AND ORANGES, and looks
tlike a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject
tmatter. Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres
tand cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist
tSanta hovering over the roof tops.

<b>tSHOT. BETTY.
</b>
tShe stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to
twander across the street. It's late afternoon and the
tbusiness district is empty. Betty crosses in the middle of
tthe block, staring straight ahead.

<b>tINT. SODA SHOP.
</b>
tThe door opens and she sticks her head inside. Most of the
tplace is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining
tthrough the window near the back of the store. Betty glances
taround. The little bell JINGLES as she enters.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (OS)
</b>ttWe're closed right now ...

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE.
</b>
tHe sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a
tboard which doubles as a canvas. Mr. Johnson glances over his
tshoulder and recognizes Betty in the doorway.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttOh, hi ...

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(turning to leave)
ttI'm sorry ...

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttNo, no ... Come on in.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE.
</b>
tHe gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still
tholding the palette in his hand. Betty stares at the "Cubist
tChristmas" in the window.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttI just thought ... It's beautiful.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttThanks.

tTheir eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr.
tJohnson motions toward his easel.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (CONT)
</b>ttI was just trying to do one of these
tt"still lifes."

tHe sighs and looks behind him. Next to the easel is a bowl of
<b>tGRAY FRUIT.
</b>
<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (CONT)
</b>ttHaving kind of a tough time.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttI think it looks nice.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttWell ...
ttt(shrugs)
ttHere's what it's s'posed to look like.

tHe leads her over to the table and points down at the art
tbook. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttOh my ...

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tThey are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at
tthe book. Neither one of them moves. Betty almost disappears
tinto the pictures--drawn by a strange new world.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttHere. Look at this.

tHe turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color. The image is
tnearly electric.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(breathless)
ttWhere'd you get this?

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttBud brought it to me.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttBud?

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttHere's my favorite.

<b>tINSERT. BOOK.
</b>
tHe turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's "Weeping
tWomen." The woman is rendered in pink and red and green. Her
thead is a large sphere, laying "peacefully" on her own
tshoulder.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttWhat do you think?

tShe doesn't answer ...

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (CONT)
</b>ttIsn't it great how she's resting like

</b>ttNo she's not.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttYes she is.

tHe looks up at her ...

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE.
</b>
tA single tear is running down Betty's cheek. She senses it
tand reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just
twiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of GRAY MAKE-UP.
tA long strip of PINK FLESH is revealed underneath.

<b>tANGLE. MR. JOHNSON.
</b>
tHe stares up at her in amazement.

<b>tANGLE. BETTY.
</b>
tShe senses something and glances down at her hand. Her
tfingertips are covered in GRAY MAKE-UP. Betty turns and bolts
tfor the door.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttt(following her)
ttWait ...

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttI've got to go ...

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttIt's alright.

tHe stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the
twall. Mr. Johnson touches her shoulder.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (CONT)
</b>ttIt's alright. Let me see.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(shame)
ttNo ...

tHe reaches up and gently touches her chin. Mr. Johnson moves
taround to glimpse the other side of her cheek.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttIt's beautiful.

<b>tCLOSER ...
</b>
tShe freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly,
tturns toward him. THE COLOR of her real flesh is revealed
tunderneath. Betty stands there exposed.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttt(a whisper)
tt... It's beautiful.

tShe swallows, not sure what to do. Betty glances down.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (CONT)
</b>ttYou shouldn't cover that up.

tMr. Johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on
tthe counter and pulls one out. He leans forward and dabs at
tthe tears beneath Betty's eyes. Then slowly, gently, he
tstarts to wipe the makeup off her cheek.

<b>tCLOSER STILL ...
</b>
tShe recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him. Mr.
tJohnson is gazing at her "true color" with wonder and
tacceptance. She hesitates for an instant, then seems to make
ta decision. Betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing
ther flesh all the way down to the neck. Mr. Johnson continues
tto wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the
tbeautiful pink flesh begins to emerge ...

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

tShe lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing
tearlier. Jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the
tpages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word. After a
tmoment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting
tthe book. The cover is plainly visible: "LADY CHATTERLY'S
<b>tLOVER."
</b>
<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tShe doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed
tand crosses to "her" desk. She sits in the chair and flattens
tthe book in front of her. Jennifer is deep into the plot and
tdoesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. She
tcould almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the
tlittle desk.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE.
</b>
tShe flips the page and peers more intently. Her hair is
tbothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony
ttail. After a little while her eyes begin to get more tired
tand she looks up and blinks a couple of times. Jennifer
tnotices something across the desk.

tA pair of Mary Sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of
ther. Jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances
tback down at the print.

<b>ttttJENNIFER

ttHunh.

tShe can see much clearer now. Jennifer folds her hands in
tfront of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked
tthe PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY SUE THAT SITS BESIDE HER IN A SILVER
tFRAME. The face is the same, but that's to be expected. So is
tthe pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look
ton her face. Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel
twhen there is a loud TAP on the window.

tShe rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. Jennifer
tslides open the window.

tfigurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts.
tShe wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it
tforms a translucent silhouette ... She lays the sweater
tacross the grass and leans back on it.

tIt is Cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that

tfully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual
tnude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself
trevealed like that. The COLORS are all hot pinks and oranges
tand yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime.
tThere is another even LOUDER PEEL OF THUNDER.

tShe looks at him frightened. David smiles.

tHe looks back at her. No top either. David smiles, drenched
tin rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to
tshiver.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt's fine. Come on.

tHe leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the
tkids are clustered together. They look at one another,
tterrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an
toverhanging rock.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttIt's alright. There's nothing to be
ttafraid of.

tGeorge wanders through the empty and darkened house
tcompletely perplexed and utterly disoriented. He looks around
tfor his family, but all he can find are the darkened rooms
tand the sound of the driving storm.

tHe still can't find her and he crosses into the DINING ROOM.

tconfused.

tHe sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking

tIt's really blowing now. The rain is coming down in heavy

topens and George wanders out onto the front porch, still
tdressed in his shirtsleeves.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttWhere's my DINNER!

</b>
tHe stumbles down the front walk in a state of complete

</b>

tHe turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance
tagency where he works. George howls into the wind and he
tpasses the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery ...
tFinally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well
twith the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain.
tGeorge lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened
tshop. His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering ...

tThe NOISE from the crashing pins is deafening and there
taren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed ...

tHe picks up a 7-10 split and claps his hands in delight. He
tstarts to cross back to the scorer's table when he looks up
tand suddenly stops.

tGeorge is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold
tand shivering. His shirt is soaked through to the skin. His

tHe doesn't answer. George clutches his body and keeps
tshivering.

tThe men stop bowling and rush to George's side. He blinks a

</b>ttSo I went into the kitchen and I

ttBut there was no one there either.
ttNo wife. No lights. No dinner.

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT)
</b>ttSo I went to the oven--you know--

ttme one of those "TV dinners ..."

tThe men nod and lean forward. George shakes his head.

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT)
</b>ttBut she hadn't. She was gone.

tA LOUDER MURMUR moves through the crowd. George lowers his
thead and just shakes it from side to side. Big Bob moves up
tand puts a hand on his shoulder.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttt(gently/
tttthe patriarch)
tt... It's gonna be fine George.

tGeorge looks up at him helplessly. Bob pats him reassuringly
ton the back.

</b>ttWhat do we do Bob?

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttWell--we'll be safe for now--thank
ttgoodness we're in a bowling alley--
ttbut if George here doesn't get his

ttIt could be you Gus, or you Burt, or

tThey murmur again. Bob gathers a little steam.

<b>ttttBOB (CONT)
</b>ttt(like a WWII movie)
tt... That's real rain out there

tGus nods. Big Bob turns to George and smiles. It's a warm,

ttAnd the first thing you're gonna do

</b>
tThe rain still pounds out the window. Betty and Mr. Johnson
tare huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through
tMr. Johnson's snow scene in the window. Betty is in soft
tradiant color now. Almost the whole frame seems to glow
tpink ...

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttYou can't go out there.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttBut I really should get home.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttBut you can't go out there.

tThere is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of
tTHUNDER. Betty sighs. She's past struggling. Betty shuts her
teyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the
troof.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttSounds nice ... Once you get used
ttto it.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttt(listening)
ttYeah. It does.

tThere is another flash and a loud BOOM. Betty smiles this
ttime.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttLike a drum.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttYeah.
ttt(thinks)
ttOr like sprinklers in the summer ...

tBetty smiles. They both listen for a moment and the fear
tseems to fade a little. The RAIN POUNDS harder on the roof as
tBetty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to Mr.
tJohnson. They just sit there listening for a moment or two.
tBetty starts to smile ...

<b>tEXT. LOVER'S LANE.

tDavid huddles with Margaret under the rocky ledge as she
tnestles against him with her head on his shoulder.

<b>tINT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.
</b>
tShe lies on her bed, still reading the book, the spitting
timage of Mary Sue. Her hair is up in a bun now. The glasses
thave slipped down her nose. There is another fork of
tlightning and the LOUDEST THUNDER CLAP of all. Jennifer
tsmiles slightly and pulls Mary Sue's afghan over her
tshoulders as she fluffs the pillow and turns the page.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

</b>
tDrops of moisture cling to the petals as it GLEAMS BRILLIANT

</b>
<b>tAERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE.
</b>
tThe rain is gone now. The town glistens in the sunlight
tcomplete with a huge RAINBOW arching across the sky.
tLiterally all the COLORS IN THE RAINBOW shine against the
tblack and white of the town. It looks like a greeting card.

<b>tINT. SODA SHOP.
</b>
tBetty and Mr. Johnson are asleep in the booth, lying in each
tother's arms. Sunlight streams in through the window, warming
tMr. Johnson's face which has now turned to color. He opens
this eyes and looks outside ...

ttOh my Gosh ...

tShe has passed out on her bed with her book on her chest.

tDavid comes gliding up Maple Street in the sunshine with a

tlook that a boy only knows once in his life. Perplexingly he
tis still in black and white. Bud turns on Elm Street and
tstarts heading for his house when he glances up and suddenly
tfreezes.

ttIt goes away ... It'll go away.

</b>ttt(half whisper)
tt... There's a meatloaf in the fridge.
ttYou just put it in the oven and turn

tDozens of black and white citizens stream in through the
tfront door.

<b>tSHOT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET.
</b>
tSeveral "transformed" teenagers stare at the spectacle with
ttheir FLESH COLORED SKIN AND BRIGHT BLUE EYES. They seem to
thang back in the shadows.

<b>tINT. TOWN HALL.
</b>
tBig Bob stands at the podium beneath a permanent banner that
treads "PLEASANTVILLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE." As the only
tlegally constituted body in Pleasantville, it is a natural
tplace for a town meeting. There is nothing bright and cheery
thowever. The floor lamps in each comer cast huge, looming
tshadows up the walls. The light at the podium bathes Big
tBob's face in a blinding splash of light. The whole thing
tevokes some weird twisted image from German Expressionism--
tlike they are about to go look for Frankenstein. It is grayer
tthan gray.

<b>tCLOSER. PODIUM.
</b>
tBig Bob stands at a lectern with a Rotary insignia on the
tfront. He speaks calmly but compellingly to a hundred men and
twomen who hang on his every word. Bob holds a BRIGHT YELLOW
<b>tGRAPEFRUIT.
</b>
<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttThis was found over in Dave Murphy's
tttrash can. There were four of them
ttlike this ...

tThere is a murmur from the crowd ...

<b>tCLOSE UP. GEORGE.
</b>
tHe sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind
tBob. George wears a shiny new ROTARY PIN in his lapel, as a
tfull-fledged member of the Chamber of Commerce. He sits stoic
tand upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a
tshiny new pin can give you.

<b>tSHOT. BOB.
</b>
tHe holds up a pair of BRIGHT RED BOXER SHORTS.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttJane Davidson found these in her
ttson's laundry basket.

tThere is a LOUDER MURMUR. The crowd shifts in their seats.
tBob points behind him to a BRIGHT GREEN lawn chair.

<b>tEXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.
</b>
tDavid and Margaret stand beneath the big Elm tree outside
tMargaret's house: a statue of two young lovers. They wrap
ttheir arms around each other in a classic silhouette. The
tmeeting across town seems a million miles away. After a
tmoment or two, David reaches behind the tree and pulls out a
tbeautifully wrapped gift. It is three feet long with a bright
tRED bow.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(softly)
ttI got you something.

tMargaret's eyes widen. She beams at him, then tears off the
twrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella ... a real
tumbrella. She looks up at him thrilled.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttIt's beautiful. Where'd you get it?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt was a prop for the school play ...

tShe looks down and giggles.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttCan I open it?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttSure ...

tMargaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. She
tputs it back on her shoulder and turns a series of
tpirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points
ther face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a
tsummer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the
tcorner.

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tDavid grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. Margaret
tlooks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and
ttwo TEENAGE BOYS pull up beside them. They are clean cut with
tBLACK AND WHITE faces ...

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttHello Bud ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(clipped)
ttHello Whitey.

tThey smile at each other for no good reason. It's scary and

</b>ttOh. We're s'posed to go out and

tleers ...

<b>ttttWHITEY (CONT)
</b>ttNo reason hunh ... See I thought
ttmaybe it was cause you were too

tMargaret literally flinches. The boys share a PEEL OF
tLAUGHTER AND SNORT AT EACH OTHER. David puts an arm around
ther and pulls her close.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhy don't you guys just get the
tthell out of here.

<b>ttttWHITEY
</b>ttOh, okay, Bud. We'll do that.

tHe guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns
ttoward Margaret.

<b>ttttWHITEY (CONT)
</b>ttt(leering more)
ttYou know Margaret, you can come
ttover and bake those Oatmeal cookies
ttfor me anytime you want to.

tThey share another CHORTLE as Whitey guns the car and peels
tout with a SCREECH. Margaret's lip starts to quiver and David
tholds her tighter ...

</b>ttIt's fine ... It doesn't mean anything.

tShe nods, groping for reassurance ...

tBob lifts his hands in the air. The crowd quiets down a bit.

</b>ttObviously certain "changes" have
ttbeen happening. Up until now, things
ttin Pleasantville have always been--
ttwell ... "Pleasant." And, recently,

ttthe first thing we have to do is to

tnewly handwritten sign clearly in the front window:

tAs the businesses are opened on Main Street, more and more

tturns left toward the soda shop, does a double take and slams
tinto a trash can ...

<b>tWIDER. SODA SHOP.

tWhere Mr. Johnson had once painted his cubist snow scene,
tthere is a brand new painting that isn't cubist at all. A

tcurving sensual brush strokes. Joey stops his bike and just
tstares in amazement. He gets up and rides away as fast as he
tpossibly can ...

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

<b>tSHOT. TV SCREEN.
</b>
tAll at once a box appears in the upper right hand comer of
tthe screen containing the image of David and Margaret at
tLover's Lane. The VIDEOTAPE rolls forward as she extends the
tBRIGHT RED APPLE. David hesitates, then takes it, then puts
tit to his mouth and takes a bite.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b><b>tt"YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS PLACE."

<b>tELM STREET. DAY.
</b>
tDavid sprints down the tree lined street toward his house.
tThe leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn GREEN
teven this far into town. David vaults over Mr. Simpson's
thedge and goes tearing up his front walk.

<b>tINT. FOYER.
</b>
tThe door flies open and he rushes in, breathless. David
tglances around the house to make sure that it is empty. He
tcrosses into the living room.

<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM.
</b>
tDavid rushes to the TV and grabs the remote. He looks down at
tit, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door.

<b>tMAIN STREET. DAY.
</b>
tDavid moves quickly down Main Street looking for a place to
tstash the remote. He pauses in front of the Pleasantville
tTravel Agency. It has posters in the window depicting various
tdestinations in and around Pleasantville (the place doesn't
tsee much business). David bends down to stash the remote in a
tdrain pipe near the entrance when he hears VOICES from up the
tstreet.

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tDavid turns to see a small crowd up near the end of Main
tStreet. He sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to
this feet as the voices get louder.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE.
</b>
tThe crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a
tgroup of young men who circle around her, taunting and
tharassing her. A moment later David can make out the face:
tBETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd
tcircles her like a pack of dogs.

<b>tCLOSER. BETTY.
</b>
tThe ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the
tblack and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high
twith dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one
tanother "Oooh--let's see the rest of you ... Let's see what's
tunder that nice blue dress ... Bet she's even pinker than her
tpicture ..." One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she
tquickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to
tthe ground ...

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tDavid shields his "mother" as he shoves one of the boys into
tthe dirt. The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the
tside of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (Violence is
tas new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.)
tDavid steps in front of his "mother" with both fists
tclenched.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(as scared as she is)
ttCome on!

tHe plants his back foot primed for action. The crowd of black
tand white thugs just stares at it.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b><b>ttCOME ON!
</b>
<b>tANGLE. CROWD.
</b>
tThey look at him warily. The boy reaches up and feels the
tside of his mouth where a trickle of RED BLOOD is running
tdown his chin. He looks at his finger in horror and starts
tbacking away.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttGet out of here!

tThey back away further and David takes a threatening step.
tThe boys turn and run as he turns back to face his "mother."

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE. BETTY. (OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER)
</b>
tDavid moves up to her gently.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttAre you alright?

tShe nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. David
treaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go
twide.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttt(off her look)
ttWhat?

<b>tCLOSER. STILL OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER.
</b>
tBetty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. She
topens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected
timage of his own face. AT LAST HE HAS TURNED TO COLOR.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. DAVID.
</b>
tHe holds the mirror staring at his own reflection. The
tcourage which transformed him only seems to grow. They look
tat each other, both in color now, when David puts a gentle
tarm around her shoulder.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttCome on.

tHe begins to lead her up toward the corner.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tFULL SHOT. SODA SHOP WINDOW. DAY.
</b>
tA larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude
tpainting of Betty in the window. The jeers and cat calls are
teven louder. The "closed" sign still sits in the doorway.
tAfter a beat or two, a HUGE BRICK SHATTERS THE GLASS ...

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tA big CHEER goes up from the crowd. Drunk on adrenalin, the
tfever builds and ANOTHER BRICK SMASHES THE WINDOW. In an
tinstant, Mr. Johnson's "canvas" is totally destroyed. The
tCHEERING grows louder ...

tAlmost by osmosis, the crowd rushes the building together.
tThe door is kicked in and they stream into the place. Soon
tall that can be heard is the weird SOUND OF LAUGHTER AND
<b>tBROKEN GLASS.
</b>
<b>tINT. SODA SHOP.
</b>
tIt is an orgy of destruction. Stools are hurled--tables
tripped out. The cash register is turned over. Two boys kick
tin the front of the juke box ...

<b>tEXT. MAIN ST. DAY.
</b>
tDavid and Betty round the corner to find the Soda Shop being
tdestroyed. They stand at the far side of the intersection
twatching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok.
tAfter a moment or two, there are some more HOOTS as MARGARET
tcomes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped
topen.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOh my God.

tHe takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob. David
tstrokes her hair.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttAre you alright? Are you okay?

tShe nods. Margaret catches her breath for a moment or two,
tthen glances down to her side ...

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tShe is clutching the umbrella in her left hand. The thing has
tbeen ripped to shreds. The spines are broken and the fabric
tis torn. Margaret stares at the thing with a combination of
tconfusion and shame. David goes white with rage and looks
ttoward the mob.

<b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(taking his arm)
ttNo. Let's get out of here.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. COUNTRY ROAD. (LEADING TO LOVER'S LANE).
</b>
tThey all ride in George's convertible up the twisting turning
troad. It has turned completely PINK with the dogwood petals.
tDavid winds up the trail, in the fading light, looking for
trefuge. He clutches the wheel tight.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWe should be okay up here.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.
</b>
tThe car twists and turns up the narrow dirt road. After a
tmoment, Lover's Lane reveals itself. It is lush and green
tlike before only this time, there is one major difference. A
tphalanx of BLACK AND WHITE THUGS have created a roadblock in
tthe foreground.

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tDavid jams on his breaks when he sees the barrier. It is a
tweird incongruous image: the black and white roadblock in
tfront with the vibrant colors of the pond and willow behind--
tlike some perfect dream you can never get to. The thugs have
tturned their cars sideways and dragged several huge logs
tacross the road. They hold axe-handles in their hands.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(a whisper)
ttWe better go.

<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.
</b>
tDarkness has fallen and the streetlamps have come on. Some
tdebris is scattered around the street and distant sounds of
tthe mob still fill the air. David rolls back into town with
tthe headlights off.

<b>tCLOSER. CAR.
</b>
<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttWhere are they?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI'm not sure.

tThey head down Main St. and turn the comer on Walnut. All at
tonce, a weird ORANGE LIGHT bathes the car ...

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. THEIR POV.
</b>
tA BONFIRE has been lit in the middle of the street between the
tlibrary and the barber shop. Twenty to thirty people are
tgathered around it still whooping and hollering as the bright
tORANGE FLAMES shoot into the air.

<b>tANGLE. CAR.
</b>
tDavid pulls over by the curb, and their eyes go wide ...

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE.
</b>
tFrom closer up, it becomes clear what they're burning. Huge
tpiles of library books have been dumped onto the sidewalk,
twaiting their turn on the pyre. There is a strange celebratory
tatmosphere as they chuck book after book on the flames, with
tthe glee of a teenager tossing a firecracker. David sees
tsomething and bolts from the car ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOh my God.

<b>tANGLE. SIDE OF THE BONFIRE.
</b>
tJennifer is locked in some strange wrestling match with Biff.
tHe clutches a book over her head while she tugs at his wrist
ttrying to stop him from throwing it on the fire ...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttDon't! Just let go.

<b>ttttBIFF
</b>ttIt's better, Mary Sue.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttI said, NO!
ttt(yanking it)
tt... I've read like one book in my
ttwhole life and I'll be damned if I
ttlet you throw it on that fire ...

tJennifer wrestles with him for a couple of seconds and then
tsuddenly kicks Biff in the groin. He doubles over in agony
twhen Jennifer snatches the book and bolts in the other
tdirection.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE. STREET.
</b>
tShe sprints up the street and is just passing the barber shop
twhen a hand reaches out and grabs her. Jennifer starts to
tscream but David puts a hand to her mouth.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(a whisper)
ttIt's okay. It's me.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tWIDE SHOT. SODA SHOP. OTHER SIDE OF MAIN STREET.
</b>
tThe crowd has moved on and all that is left is the dark
twreckage of the soda shop. Several stools lie out in the
tstreet and shards of brightly painted glass are scattered
taround the sidewalk. It is eerily quiet.

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tDavid, Betty and Margaret sit silently in the car, across the
tstreet with the lights off. He unlatches the door handle and
tgets out slowly. The rest of them follow him into the empty
tstreet as they move silently toward the soda shop, like some
tplatoon on patrol.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE.
</b>
tAs they get closer, more of the wreckage comes into view. Half
ta booth ... a soda spigot ... After a moment or two Jennifer
tlooks up and gasps.

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tSeveral teenagers step out of the shadows. They have scraped
tfaces and ripped clothing--the signs. Most are dazed and ALL
tOF THEM ARE IN COLOR. After a second or two, more appear:
tMary Jane ... Lisa Anne ... The boy who was reading Huck
tFinn...

<b>tANGLE. DAVID.
</b>
tThe kids turn to him as if he has some kind of answer. Of
tcourse he doesn't. The sounds of the Mob still carry through
tthe air from somewhere off in the distance.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttLet's go inside.

<b>tINT. SODA SHOP.
</b>
tThe place is just sad. All the remnants of what they had are
tstrewn around the floor, The jukebox is turned over. The
tstools are ripped out of the floor. Betty looks over at the
tcorner where he painted her ... The easel is smashed to bits.

<b>tANGLE. BETTY.
</b>
tShe brings a knuckle to her lip and David puts an arm around
ther and draws her close. After a moment or two they HEAR a
tweird SCRAPING sound.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttHello?

tThe SCRAPING SOUND stops. They all look to the open door and
tafter a second or two, Mr. Johnson appears holding a broom and
tdustpan.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttJust thought I'd try to tidy it up
tta bit.

tBetty runs across and throws her arms around him. The
tteenagers watch as she holds him tight.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON (CONT)
</b>ttIt's okay. Once we sweep it up it'll
ttbe alright again ...

tBetty stifles a sob as he strokes her hair. No one says
tanything while they just embrace for a moment. Finally ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWell he's right. Come on. Let's turn
ttthese booths back up. "Mary Sue",
ttwhy don't you help me slide this in
ttfront of the door. We'll be okay in
tthere.

tThey respond to the tone of leadership. One by one the kids
tstart to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage.
tJennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as
tthe kids try to put their shop back together.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. TOWN HALL. (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETING) NIGHT.
</b>
tBig Bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house. The
tatmosphere is odd: somewhere between a bake-off and a
tlynching. People sit in the aisles and in the window sills.
tBob points his finger.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttThis is not the answer people.

tThe crowd quiets a bit. He leans over the lectern.

<b>ttttBOB (CONT)
</b>ttNo matter how upset we may get, or
tthow frustrated we may be, we're
ttnot gonna solve our problems out
ttin the street. It's just the wrong
ttway to do it. We have to have a
tt"Code of Conduct" we can all agree
ttto live by.

tHis tone grows softer--more concerned ...

<b>ttttBOB (CONT)
</b>ttNow, I asked George and Burt here
ttto sketch out some ideas-and I
ttthink they've done a terrific job.
ttt(beat/
tttscans the crowd)
ttIf we all agree on these then we
ttcan take a vote and I think we'll
ttstart to move in the right direction.

<b>tANGLE. CROWD.
</b>
tThey murmur and nod ...

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttt(reading from the
<b>tttCODE OF CONDUCT")
</b>tt"ONE: All public disruption and
ttacts of vandalism are to cease
ttimmediately."

<b>tEXT. BONFIRE. NIGHT.
</b>
tIt is still ablaze with books. As Bob continues to READ in
tVOICE OVER, a firetruck comes screeching up to the curb.

<b>tSHOT. FIRETRUCK.
</b>
tThe same fireman who learned to use the hose before pulls
tseveral yards of it from the back of the truck. He can barely
tcontain his excitement as he gets to open the valve and
textinguish the raging bonfire ...

<b>ttttBOB
</b>tt"TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville
ttare to treat one another in a
ttcourteous and "pleasant" manner ..."

<b>tSERIES OF SHOTS. LAMPPOSTS.
</b>
tThe CODE OF CONDUCT is nailed to lampposts and tree trunks in
trapid succession. It is plastered on walls and in shop
twindows ...

<b>tSODA SHOP.
</b>
tDebris is still strewn around the street. A dim light
temanates from inside.

<b>tINT. SODA SHOP.
</b>
tIt looks like a scene from the French Revolution. Ten to
tfifteen kids huddle behind the barricade while David reads
tthe code of conduct out loud by flashlight.

<b>ttttLISA ANNE
</b>tt"Courteous and Pleasant manner."
ttThat doesn't sound too bad.

tDavid just looks at her then continues.

</b>ttt(reading from THE CODE)

ttWow.

tDavid lowers the paper.

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE.
</b>
tIt is SILENT in the soda shop. Everyone sits motionless for a
tmoment or two, letting the decree sink in. David just stares
tdown at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of
tsadness.

tOff in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling
twith the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was
tbeing read. All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner.

<b>ttttBOY
</b>ttHey. This thing works.

tHe hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop.
tRAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive
ttime.

</b>ttWell all the things that you say
ttand do Make me want to be with

ttTurn that off!

tThe boy looks back at her.

<b>ttttLISA ANNE (CONT)
</b>ttt(shrieking)
ttYou're not allowed to do that now!

tHe flinches and pulls the plug from the wall. The jukebox
twinds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it.
tDavid looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear
ttone.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttSure you are.

tHe walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids
twatch spellbound at this personal display of defiance.

<b>tWIDER SHOT. SODA SHOP.
</b>
tBuddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly
tdifferent meaning. All the kids listen spellbound, as if to
tan anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious
treputation.

<b>ttttBUDDY HOLLY
</b>ttThe little things that you say and do
ttMake we want to be with you-oo-oo ...
ttRAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ...
ttRAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ...

tJennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an
tarm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little stronger--a little
tsafer ... The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they
tdon't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel
tashamed.

tTwenty "colored" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE
tON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the
thelm of his ship ...

<b>tEXT. STREET. LATER ...
</b>
tHe steps out over the debris and looks both directions. David
tmotions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge.
tThe disturbance seems to have died down and the street is
tsilent although strewn with debris. David turns to the kids.

<b>ttttDAVID

tBetty is asleep in one of the booths. Jennifer sleeps beside

tDavid opens his eyes.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.
</b>
tMr. Johnson is standing in the middle of the shop, staring at
tthe large piece of plywood where his window used to be. He
tjust gazes at the thing as if he could look through it.
tThere's a faraway look in his eye.

</b>
tHe rises carefully from the booth, without waking Margaret.
tDavid crosses over to Mr. Johnson and speaks in a whisper.

ttI don't know what I'd do if I

</b>
tHe just nods. David glances down at the table next to him. He
tpicks up one of the brightly painted shards of glass and just
tlooks at it. It's orange and pink and yellow. David thinks
tfor a second.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttMaybe I have an idea.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

</b>
tThe same paper boy who rode into the trash can, peddles down
tMain Street tossing his papers toward the curb. He throws
tright toward the post office, then left toward the hardware
tstore, then right toward the bakery, then finally looks up.

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tThis time the boy slams into a lamp post. He tumbles off his
tbike and stares straight ahead in disbelief ...

<b>tHIS POV. TOWN HALL.
</b>
tTwo men sleep at the base of the wall next to a clutter of
tpaint cans. Above them, however, is painted A VIVID ALMOST
tUTOPIAN MURAL OF THE TOWN OF PLEASANTVILLE in LIVING COLOR.
tInstead of being drab, the place literally gleams with life.
tThe post office turns out to be a RICH RED BRICK. The sky
tshines in vibrant BLUE. It is a rendering of what the town
tcould look like. David and Mr. Johnson sleep soundly next to
ttheir own signatures. David opens his eyes and sees the
tpaperboy ...

<b>tANGLE. PAPER BOY.
</b>
tHe turns around and rides away as fast as he can.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. TOWN HALL. LATER ...
</b>
tA huge crowd has gathered. There is a loud buzz in the air.
tDavid and Mr. Johnson stand side by side in front of their
twork like they're presenting and guarding it at the same
ttime.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. CROWD.
</b>
tMost of the faces are black and white. A few near the back
tare in color. Big Bob moves through the back of the crowd,
thurriedly buttoning his shirt. The buzz grows and the people
tpart as he heads toward the front of the pack ...

<b>tANGLE. FRONT OF CROWD.
</b>
tWhen Bob emerges from the crowd, Mr. Johnson flinches
tslightly. David just looks him in the eye and tries to find
tas much courage as he can. "Big" Bob looks up at the color
trendering of his town with absolute horror. His eye scans the
tgreen trees, the bright yellow gas station, the puffy pink
tclouds on the horizon.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttt(bellowing)
ttDid you do this?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(quietly but clearly)
ttYes I did.

tBob grabs a copy of the Code of Conduct and waves it at him.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttDo you know that it's illegal?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(thinks)
ttYes I do.

tBob looks dumbfounded. He tries to process the whole thing
tbut just looks more confused. Bob runs his hand through his
thair, shaking his head.

<b>ttttBOB
</b><b>ttBUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
</b>
<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttBecause anybody should be able to
ttpaint in whatever color they want.

<b>tANGLE. BACK OF CROWD.
</b>
tBetty stands beside Margaret and Jennifer watching the
tspectacle. There are tears in her eyes and a great deal of
tlove. Jennifer smiles with pride at her brother ...

<b>tSHOT. BOB.
</b>
<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttYou're not allowed to do this! I
ttcould arrest you for this.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttStill doesn't make it right.

tThere is some clapping from the back of the crowd. Bob's eyes
twiden. His face goes flushed (darker gray). A vein bulges in
this neck. He turns to the police chief.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttDan! Arrest them!

<b>ttttDAN (POLICE CHIEF)
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttUm ... I don't know how to do that,
ttBob.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttWhat do you mean!?

<b>ttttDAN
</b>ttWell, I never had to do it before.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttYou put handcuffs on them and you
tttake them to the police station.

<b>ttttDAN
</b>ttt(thinks)
ttOh. guess I could do that, then.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(suddenly stronger)
ttC'mere, Dan. I'll help you.

tDavid walks toward the police chief and sticks his hands out.
tA louder murmur moves through the crowd as David actually
thelps him fasten on the cuffs. Mr. Johnson comes over to join
tthem and the murmur starts to grow ...

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tNIGHT TIME.
</b>
tA bright full moon stands out against a jet black sky ...

<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.
</b>
tA group of "colored" kids hangs out on Main Street near the
tpolice station. They gaze off into the distance at the barred
twindow of a jail cell. It is elevated half a story above the
tstreet. Everything is black and white except for the warm
tYELLOW LIGHT, that glows through the bars. They know in a
tglance who's inside.

<b>tINT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT.
</b>
tDavid sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling. The place has
tnever been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the
tsheets and pillow cases. He can't help smiling.

<b>tINT. DIFFERENT JAIL CELL. WAY OFF DOWN THE HALL ...
</b>
tMr. Johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food. He
tclutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in
ttrue "inmate" fashion.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. WALL.
</b>
tRather than scratching the days or even the hours, Mr.
tJohnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall
tcomplete with lush forest and a running brook. He looks at
this work and smiles.

<b>tSHOT. POLICE CHIEF.
</b>
tHe approaches David's cell from the other direction and
tknocks gently on the bars. David turns around.

<b>ttttDAN
</b>ttThere's someone to see you Bud.

<b>tDAVID.
</b>
tDavid sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could
tbe. After a moment or two, a strange look of understanding
tcrosses his face. He HEARS the sound of a KEY TURNING IN THE
tLOCK. David looks up at the doorway and smiles.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI thought it might be you.

<b>tREVERSE ANGLE. DICK VAN DYKE.
</b>
tHe stands in the doorway, still dressed in his TV repairman's
toutfit. FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE IS COMPLETELY IN BLACK AND
<b>tWHITE.
</b>
<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttHope you're proud of yourself.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI am actually ... Glad to see you've
ttfinally shown your true colors.

tDick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the
tcell behind him.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttOkay, let's cut the shit and get
ttright to it. Where's that remote
ttcontrol?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttBecause you're coming home.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(smiles)
ttWhy don't you just take me back
ttwithout it?

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttOh. You're a smart little bastard
ttaren't you?
ttt(tightly)
ttIt's kind of like a restricted
ttticket. You gotta leave the same
ttway you came.

tDavid just looks at him. He smiles, confidently. Leans back
ton the bunk ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttSo ... I guess as long as I'm
tthere, all sorts of things could
tthappen to this place. We could
tthave pink lawns and blue trees ...

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttJust gimme the damn remote!

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI'm sorry. I can't do that.

tDick Van Dyke takes a deep breath. He glances toward the
tbarred window.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttI don't know what went wrong.
ttYou answered every question. You
ttknew every detail. The senior
ttProm ... McIntire's Department
ttStore. We had all the same warm
ttmemories: Sock hops. The Church
ttSocial ...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttThey weren't my memories.
ttt(beat)
ttI borrowed them. It's no good when
ttyou borrow them.

tDick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to
ttremble.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttt(containing his rage)
ttHow long do you think you've been
tthere?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(warily)
ttI don't know ... Three, four weeks.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttMuch less than that.
ttt(checks his watch)
ttAn hour and a half.

tDavid looks at him uneasily. Dick Van Dyke flashes a broad
tnasty smile.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
</b>ttSee--and this is really great--
ttthe show was on for what--half an
tthour a week? So that means for
ttevery week that goes by in
ttPleasantville, only half an hour
ttgoes by in the real world.

tThe smile gets bigger. Dick Van Dyke moves closer to him.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
</b>ttNow Buddy, you're going on trial
tttomorrow. And if they find you
ttguilty, you're gonna be stuck here
ttforever. Well, not forever--lemme
ttthink ...
ttt(calculates)
ttFive year sentence ... Carry the
ttthree ... That comes out to ...
ttsixteen and a half centuries, and
ttthat's rounding down.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI'm going on trial tomorrow?

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttThis is TV pal. They don't fool
ttaround.

tDavid is rocked but tries not to show it.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(stoicly)
ttThere's worse places.

<b>ttttDICK VAN DYKE
</b>ttOh sure. For the first hundred
ttyears. Then it starts to get a
ttlittle monotonous.
ttt(beat)
ttSleep well.

tHe taps on the bars for Dan who opens the lock and lets him
tout. The door CLANGS shut as the two of them disappear down
tthe hall. The minute they are gone, the stoicism falls. David
tlooks around his cell, truly afraid.

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tHe stares at the tiny cot ... The plain light bulb in the
tceiling ... The single pillow with the plastic covering it
t... Forever is starting to look like a long time. David
tcrosses to the small window and looks out.

<b>tHIS POV. OUT THE WINDOW.
</b>
tAcross the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall
tcomplete with the newly painted mural. The "Utopian" view of
tPleasantville is just as he left it with one notable
texception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to
<b>tBLACK AND WHITE.
</b>
<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. TOWN HALL. DAY.
</b>
tIt is bathed in sunlight. Dozens of people stream through the
tfront door for the first trial in Pleasantville's history.
tThere is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air.

<b>tINT. TOWN HALL. DAY.
</b>
tThe place has been transformed from the Chamber of Commerce
tmeeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews
tand ceiling fans. The only carry over from its previous
tconfiguration is the huge CHAMBER OF COMMERCE banner draped
tacross the back wall.

<b>tANGLE. BENCH.
</b>
tAt the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is
ta large, elevated judge's bench with a Rotary insignia on the
tfront. Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings
tfinally living up to his name. The whole thing is a strange
tcombination of Franz Kafka and "Inherit the Wind." Big Bob
tbangs the gavel ...

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tThe undertone begins to quiet down. All of the faces in the
tpews are Black and White. There is a "colored" section in the
tback for standing room only.

<b>tANGLE. JURORS BOX.
</b>
tGeorge is seated in the front row of the jury, despite his
trelationship to one of the defendants. He is dressed
timpeccably with his Rotary Pin still gleaming on his lapel.
tAfter a moment or two he sneaks a glance toward the back of
tthe room ...

<b>tANGLE. BETTY.
</b>
tShe stands in the back with the rest of the "colored" faces.
tBetty cranes her head to catch a glimpse of David or Mr.
tJohnson. All at once, a hush goes through the crowd.

<b>tANGLE. DOORWAY.
</b>
tIt swings open and David and Mr. Johnson are led in wearing
thandcuffs. Dan, the Police Chief (now ballif), shows them to
ta table in the center of the room directly facing Big Bob.
tThere is no lawyer present. There is also no prosecutor.

<b>tANGLE. DAVID.
</b>
tHe glances around a little confused. (Weird courtroom.) Big
tBob bangs the gavel.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttBud Parker and William Johnson,
ttyou have been charged with
ttdesecration of a public building
ttand the intentional use of
ttprohibited paint colors in
ttviolation of the Pleasantville
ttCode of Conduct and laws of
ttcommon decency. Do you admit that
tton the night of May 1, you did
ttconsciously and willfully apply
ttthe following FORBIDDEN colors to
ttthe Pleasantville Town Hall:
ttt(beat)
ttRed, Pink, Vermillion, Puce,
ttChartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox
ttBlood, Green, Peach, Crimson,
ttYellow, Olive and Magenta.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttUm ... Yes I do. Where's our
ttlawyer?

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttWe prefer to keep these
ttproceedings as "pleasant" as
ttpossible. I don't think a lawyer
ttwill be necessary.

tThere is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the
tblack and white faces. Big Bob smiles to himself then
tproceeds.

<b>ttttBOB (CONT)
</b>ttDo you further admit that this
ttwas done surreptitiously and
ttunder the cover of darkness?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWell--it was dark out ...

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttGood. Do you further admit that
ttthis unnatural depiction occurred
ttin full public view where it was
ttaccessible to, and in plain sight
ttof, minor children?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt was accessible to everyone.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttVery well. Let the record show
ttthat the defendants have answered
ttin the affirmative to all the
ttcharges.

tHe looks directly at them for the first time.

<b>ttttBOB (CONT)
</b>ttDo you have anything to say in
ttyour defense?

<b>tSHOT. DEFENSE TABLE.
</b>
tMr. Johnson just looks at David, confused and terrified.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttI didn`t mean to hurt anybody.
ttI just have to paint ... I
ttneed to.

tHe gropes for something else to say, but what else is there?
tDavid glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat.
tDavid rises from his chair.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI think I've got something to say.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttVery well ...

tDavid looks out over the audience. After a moment or two, he
tlooks back at Big Bob.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI think I know why you're doing
ttthis. I mean, I understand why
ttyou're doing this. I used to
ttfeel the same way. I used to
ttwant this place to stay just the
ttway it was. I never wanted it to
ttchange ...

tThere is a loud MURMUR. Big Bob bangs the gavel.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttt(he smiles slightly)
ttBut nothing stays the same. You
ttget things, and you lose things,
ttand that's the good part and the
ttbad part--but you can't have a
ttgood part without a bad part.

tHe turns and sees his mother in the balcony. They lock eyes
tfor a moment. David smiles slightly and continues.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttIt's like the basketball team.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttt(leaning forward)
ttThe basketball team?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttSure. Everybody's upset because
ttthey're not winning anymore--but
ttjust think how it would feel if
ttall of a sudden they do win.

tThere's a murmur in the gallery.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttWouldn't it feel better than when
ttthey used to win all the time?

tThere is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob looks concerned.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttSee, I know you want it to stay
tt"Pleasant" but there are so many
ttthings that are so much better:
ttlike Silly ... or Sexy ... or
ttDangerous ... or Wild ... or
ttBrief ...
ttt(beat)
ttAnd every one of those things is
ttin you all the time if you just
tthave the guts to look for them.
ttt(pointing to the "colored" section)
ttLook at those faces back there.
ttThey're no different than you are.
ttThey just happened to see
ttsomething inside themselves that
ttyou don't want to ...

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttOkay--that's enough!

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI thought I was allowed to
ttdefend myself.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttYou're not allowed to lie.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI'm not lying ... Here I'll show
ttyou.

tHe turns suddenly toward the jury box.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttMr. Simpson ...

<b>ttttMR. SIMPSON
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhat color is that hedge of yours?

<b>ttttMR. SIMPSON
</b>ttGreen.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttNo, not that hedge. The other one.

<b>ttttMR. SIMPSON
</b>ttThe other one?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttThe one in your mind. The one
ttthat you see on a bright cold
ttmorning. The one that you see
ttwhen you walk in front of your
tthouse and you just stand there
ttand stare.

tMr. Simpson suddenly looks far away. He gets a kind of dreamy
tlook in his eye.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttWhat color is that hedge?

<b>tCLOSE UP. MR. SIMPSON.
</b>
<b>tSUDDENLY AND BEFORE OUR EYES, MR. SIMPSON TURNS TO LIVING
</b>tCOLOR. A huge MURMUR moves through the courtroom. Bob bangs
tthe gavel.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttI said, that's enough!

<b>ttttVARIOUS VOICES FROM
</b><b>ttttTHE AUDIENCE
</b>tt"No ... Let him finish ... Go on ..."

tBig Bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when David
tsuddenly turns toward George.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttAlright. Dad ...

<b>tDIFFERENT ANGLE.
</b>
tThere is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob just looks at him frozen
twhile David confronts his "father." George straightens up.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttt(solemn)
ttYes Bud.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(beat)
ttDon't you miss her?

<b>tCLOSE UP. GEORGE.
</b>
tHe looks at him stunned. Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody
tlistens. George just stares at him like he got shot.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI mean, of course you do, but it
ttisn't just the cooking or the
ttcleaning that you miss--it's
ttsomething else, isn't it ...

tGeorge swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as
the glances toward the back of the room.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttt(softer whisper)
ttMaybe you can't even describe it.
ttMaybe you only know it when it's
ttgone. Maybe it's like there's a
ttwhole piece of you that's missing
tttoo.
ttt(shrugs)
ttYou might even call it "love."

<b>ttttBIG BOB
</b>ttt(BANGING the gavel loudly)
ttOkay, that's IT!!!

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(motioning toward the back)
ttNow don't you think she looks just
ttas pretty in color? Don't you
ttthink she looks just as pretty as
ttshe did the day you met her?

tSlowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls
tdown his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a
tlong trail of COLOR behind it.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttDon't you wish you could tell her
ttthat?

tHe nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him
tthrough her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttt(POUNDING the gavel)
<b>ttYOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
</b>
<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhy am I out of order?

<b>ttttBOB
</b><b>ttBECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO
</b><b>ttTURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
</b>
<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWell I don't think it's a circus.
ttAnd I don't think they do either.

tDavid motions behind him to the black and white section.
tThere are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces.

<b>ttttBOB
</b><b>ttTHIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
</b>
<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttBut see that's just the point. It
ttcan't stop at once. Because it's
ttin you. And you can't stop
ttsomething that's in you.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttt(tightly)
ttIt's not in ME.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOh sure it is.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttNo it isn't.

tHe crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans
tover the bench and gets right up in his face.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(smug whisper)
ttWhat do you want to do to me
ttright now?

tBig Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves
tcloser.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttC'mon. Everyone's turning colors.
ttKids are making out in the street.
ttNo one's getting their dinner--
tthell, you could have a flood any
ttminute ... Pretty soon you could
tthave the women going off to work
ttwhile the men stayed home and
ttcooked ...

<b>ttttBIG BOB
</b>ttThat's not going to happen!

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttBut it could happen.

<b>ttttBIG BOB
</b>ttNo it couldn't!

tBig Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts
taround the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of
this head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely
<b>tRED IN THE FACE.
</b>
<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tA gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and
tjust smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big
tBob turns and catches his reflection in the window.

<b>tCLOSE UP. BIG BOB.
</b>
tHe sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down
tat his hands. They have gone completely RED as well. Big Bob
tfreezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and
tflees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom.

<b>tANGLE. DOORWAY.
</b>
tAs Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town
tSquare GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep
tgreen. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators
tbolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd
tmoves outside.

<b>tEXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!)
</b>
tAll the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars,
tGreen hats ... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally
tturned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David
twalks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his
tcreation. The whole town is washed in joy.

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tMargaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet
tin a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of
tconduct). Several people around them actually clap, like
tspectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and
tlooks at her brother making out.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttUch ... I am like gonna hurl ...

tDavid turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David
tthrows his arms around his sister as more and more people
tstream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ...

<b>ttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.
</b>
tDavid and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She
tclutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttAre you sure?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttI told you. I'm like positive.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttThis thing works. We could go
tthome right now.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttI'm not ready yet. I gotta do
ttthis for a little while.

<b>tWIDER.
</b>
tThey stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge).

tA large sign says: "Springfield 12 Miles" and for the first
ttime, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning.
tJennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit
tof style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the
tdistance.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttBesides. You think there's like
tta chance I'm gonna get into
ttcollege back there?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttt(thinks ...)
ttHonestly ... no.

tThey both smile.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttYou got the admissions letter.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttRight here.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttAnd you're sure about this?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttI've done the slut thing, David.
ttIt's really kinda old.

tDavid nods.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI'll come back and check on you
ttin a month.

tJennifer nods and gives him a hug. She holds on tight for a
tcouple of seconds.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttYou're like the coolest brother
ttin the world.

tDavid smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly
thear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge
tGreyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at
tthe sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at
ther brother, then turns toward the door ...

<b>tEXT. MARGARETS HOUSE. DAY.
</b>
tShe clutches her umbrella at her side. David holds a bag of
toatmeal cookies. Each one clings on to the other one's
tclothing. Their faces are inches apart.

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttYou're gonna forget about me.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttNo I won't. I swear.

tMargaret nods. She looks at him for a moment then wraps her
tarms around his neck. They meet in a long, rich, wet, soft

<b>ttttMARGARET
</b>ttt(a whisper)
ttI like calling you David.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI like it too.

<b>tINT. PARKER LIVING ROOM.
</b>
tDavid stands in front of the television with Mr. Johnson at
this side. He holds the remote control in his hand. Mr.
tJohnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttWell how do you know it won't go
ttback to the way it was?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttYou're gonna keep painting aren't

tMr. Johnson nods.

<b>ttttDAVID (CONT)
</b>ttWell ...

tHe nods again and thinks about it. They smile at each other
tone last time.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttt(remembering something)
ttOh.
ttt(reaching into his pocket)
ttI've got something for you.

tHe pulls out a folded piece of paper. Mr. Johnson extends it
tto David who unfolds it and instantly smiles.

<b>tINSERT. PAPER.
</b>
tIt is a small painted replica of their mural in the same
tvibrant colors. Everything is scaled perfectly, exactly like
tthe one on the wall.

<b>tSHOT. DAVID.
</b>
<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt's beautiful.

<b>ttttMR. JOHNSON
</b>ttJust a little--You know.

tDavid looks up at him and smiles. All at once he glances
ttoward the door.

tShe nods as well. Betty puts the sweater around his shoulders

</b>ttI'm so proud of you, Bud.

</b>ttThanks ... I love you.

</b>ttYou better stand back a little.

tBetty and Mr. Johnson cross toward the comer of the room.
tDavid points the remote at the TV ...

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MODERN HOUSING TRACT. DAY.
</b>
tAll the ersatz Spanish houses stretch out toward infinity. A
tWESTEC security patrol cruises by them at a crawl. A second
tor two later, all the sprinklers turn on in uniform
tsynchronization.

<b>tINT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM.
</b>
tHe stands in the middle of the living room looking at his
tnew/old surroundings. Everything is the same as it was. The
tblack onyx coffee table. The clean burbur rug. The big screen
tTV in its sleek black cabinet. David looks at it and smiles.
tThe place is inadvertantly in black and white.

<b>tCLOSER.
</b>
tHe reaches forward and turns on the TV (by hand) flipping
taround the dial. Jerry Springer is berating a prostitute ...
tTony Robbins hawks self-improvement in an infomercial ...
tCourt TV is doing an O.J. recap. David unfolds Mr. Johnson's
tsketch and glances down at it. He smiles to himself. A
tdifferent kind of nostalgia ...
