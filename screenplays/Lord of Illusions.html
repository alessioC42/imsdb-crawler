<b>tTITLE SEQUENCE
</b>

tAs the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:


<b>tEXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY
</b>

tA SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,
tsurreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."  Like modern demons. 
tGrotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
ttheir twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,
tbroken glass teeth.

<b>tEXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY
</b>
tTwo vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized
tflames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series
tof eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of
tsand and heat.

<b>tEND CREDITS.
</b>
<b>ttttCUT WIDE TO;
</b>
<b>tEXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY
</b>
tA violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just
tmake out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William
tNix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. 
tThe "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON
tSCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"

<b>tEXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tWe're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning
tagainst the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
tsixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,
talmost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,
tthe other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a
tscalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield
tnarrows his eyes.

<b>tBUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.
</b>
tThe Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the
thouse.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttt(softly)
ttSwann...?

tHe turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's
twhittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY
</b>
tThe house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has
tbecome the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic
tcult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
ta little of what life here is like. 

tThe rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with
tscenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from
tsome unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING
thelpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and
toppressive. 

tThe passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
tway to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the
tfloor, light these claustrophobic corridors.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttMaster?

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
tA dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
ttheir leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his
tshoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
tseductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. 

tAll the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
twear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. 
tThey watch Nix in adoration. 

tAs Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to
thand with casual ease...

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttAnd the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,
ttyou're my instrument. From now on,
ttyou'll be called the Puritan...

<b>ttttCULTISTS
</b>ttt(murmuring)
ttPuritan...

tNIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,
ttogether you will cleanse the world.

<b>ttttCULTISTS
</b>ttYes...

tButterfield enters. 

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttMaster?

tNix looks up.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttSwann's here. 

tNix rises, smiling.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttt(to Cultists)
ttWe'll come back to this. Get about
ttyour business. 

tAs the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
tA place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling
tis another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a
tlarge man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and
tknotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
tcreaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a
tperverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

tFrom the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft
<b>tSOBBING.
</b>
<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttHush...

tNix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and
tpresently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a
tfetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her
tmouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttI said hush.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttPlease.  Let me go.

tFrom the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. 
tNix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttt(to Baboon)
ttWhat is it?

tThe Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring
tits teeth as it screeches.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttt(to Girl)
ttI think he's in love.

tHe unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,
ttrailing its chain.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttKeep it away from me.

tNix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon
tstarts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS
tcatching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttPlease... please...

tNix watches her terror dispassionately.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttt(also watching, wide-
tteyed)
ttWant me to shoot Swann?

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttYou don't like him, do you?

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttHe wants your magic.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttMaybe.  Go fetch him.

tButterfield exits.  Nix advances on the Girl.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttWhat are you going to do?

<b>ttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY
</b>
tThe two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.

tFrom the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old
twith shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not
tconventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. 

tFrom the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,
tstudious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,
tskinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a
tsteely gaze.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttt(to all three)
ttAre we ready?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttt(cool)
ttSay the word.

<b>ttttPIMM
</b>ttt(very nervous)
ttLook, maybe we should think this over.

tOn Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
tof METALWORK.  We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
the slips them into his pocket.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttNo.  He's gone too far.

<b>ttttPIMM
</b>ttSo he took a child.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttHe'll kill her.

<b>ttttPIMM
</b>ttNo he won't.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttt(determined)
ttHe's not going to get the chance.

tQuaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.

<b>ttttQUAID
</b>ttIf he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttSo stay out here.

tSwann starts towards the House.  Jennifer is the first to
tfollow, with the other two on her heels.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tButterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttHe's expecting you.

tBehind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttt(to others)
ttLook around.  If you find 'the
ttchild, yell.  She's got blonde
tthair, that's all I know.

tButterfield turns away, smiling to himself.  Swann follows
thim.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAY
</b>
tQuaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS
t(three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is
tbreast-feeding a baby.

<b>tttt1ST MAN
</b>ttHey, Quaid.  I thought you said you
ttweren't coming back.

<b>ttttQUAID
</b>ttI changed my mind.

<b>tttt1ST WOMAN
</b>ttCome and join us.

tShe smiles a crazy smile.  Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE
tappears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils. 

tAnd now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the
tCultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns
taway.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,
twinding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and
tdrives his heel down on its head.

<b>ttttSNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST
</b>ttt(angry)
ttDon't do that!

tThe Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door. 
tSnake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above
this head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.

<b>tINT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   "BEDROOM"   -  DAY
</b>
tJennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where
ta BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttDon't be afraid.

tThe Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth
tpressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,
tof course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.

<b>ttttBARBARA
</b>ttI'm not... want to see?

tShe pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into
ther FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer
tretreats to the door, and exits back out into --

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
tPimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He
tis ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from
this white-knuckled fingers.

<b>ttttPIMM
</b>ttHe's going to kill us all...

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttWhere did Swann go?

tPimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
tSwann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to
this belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. 
tHe turns the door handle.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
tSwann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The
tfolds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a
tmuffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. 

tOn the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.

tSwann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As
the approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!

tHe reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half
tdressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. 

tSwann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
tOn Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the
tpassageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.

<b>ttttQUAID
</b>ttStay the fuck away!
ttt(yells)
ttPimm!  Get over here!

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
tPAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he
tstruggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the
tground beside her.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttYou're going to be okay.

tOut of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings
tround.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque
taltarpiece. 

tThe Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her
tface.  Swann turns.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttI knew you'd come. 

tHe reaches down to Swann.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttI've got so much power to give
ttyou, Swann.  All you have to do
ttis...beg.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttFuck you.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttYou don't think I've got it to
ttgive?

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttNo!

tSuddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying
tgravity.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttYou're wrong.

tHe catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back
tagainst the wall.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttI could eat your fucking soul,
ttSwann.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
tJennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps
tfrom the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's
thand.  BLOOD SPURTS.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttFuck!

tShe retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
tNix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his
tfingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a
tpsychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttYou want to know what the world
ttreally looks like?

tSwann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. 

tAnd now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin
tof Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttWant to see flesh with a god's
tteyes?

tSwann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
tQuaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the
tSanctum door.  Jennifer is at Quaid's side.

<b>ttttSWANN (V.O.)
</b>ttAah!

<b>ttttQUAID
</b>ttGet away from the door!

tButterfield shakes his head.  Quaid FIRES.  The bullet.
tstrikes the wall beside Butterfield's head.  He retreats,
tgrowling like a rabid animal.  Quaid kicks the Sanctum door
topen, and enters.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
<b>ttttQUAID
</b>ttSwann?

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttt(to Quaid)
ttHere he is.

tSwann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his
teyes blood-red.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttTake a look, Swann!  These are your
ttfriends.

tOn Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and
tJennifer.

<b>ttttJENNIFER (V.O.)
</b>ttWhat have you done to him? 

<b>SWANN'S P.O.V.
</b>
tof Quaid and Jennifer.  To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to
tbe MORPHING.  Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is
tlike a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  PRIMEVAL MUCK.

<b>ttttQUAID (V.O.)
</b>ttSwann.  It's okay.

tQuaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his
thead violently.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttDon't touch me.  He's got... got
ttinto my head.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttYou want to be like that, Swann? 
ttMud and shit?

tSwann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.

<b>tSWANN'S P.O.V. 
</b>
tof Nix, his arms outstretched in welcome.  His face has an
taura of pulsing light.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttCome here.  Share the power.

tON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom.  The trigger is
tpulled. 

tThe bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.

tON SWANN, staring at Nix. 

tSWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. 

tJust for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses
tsomething else. MORPHING out of Nix's features.  A NIGHTMARE
tFACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its
tforehead. 

tSwann covers his eyes.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttt(raging, terrifying)
ttSwann!  Swann!

tNix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his
tknees, clutching the WOUND.  As he falls, he reveals the
tashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttt(a roar)
ttHelp me!

tSwann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind-
tcontrol.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttJesus-

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
tPinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.

<b>tttt1ST CULTIST
</b>ttt(with distressing
ttconfidence)
ttYou can't kill him.

<b>tttt2ND CULTIST
</b>ttHe'll just rise up again!

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
tOn Nix, doing just that:  rising up.  Right hand clamped to
this bloody chest, left hand reaching for Swann.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttHelp me!

tQuaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder.  And again. 
tStrikes his leg.  Nix collapses to the ground,

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttQuickly!

tThey have come prepared for this.  Swann now takes from his
tjacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK.  There are
tSCREWS in then all.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttt(seeing)
ttSwann?  What are you doing?

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttBinding you.

tHe clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an
teyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his
thands on the side of the mask, and x97 LIKE MAGIC -- his touch
tmakes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into
tNix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs
tfrom the screw-holes.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttFuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!

tNow the second piece, over his MOUTH.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttSwx97

tHe's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like
tthe first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over
tthe nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into
tplace. 

tSwann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as
tit continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as
teach man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? 

tAnd now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes
tdiminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the
tground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttIs it finished?

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttIt's finished.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
tThe Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix
thad upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat,
ttheir confidence and courage gone. 

tPimm steps into the Sanctum.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
</b>
tThe five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's
tbody.  Swann has his arm around the Girl.

<b>ttttPIMM
</b>ttDead?

<b>ttttQUAID
</b>ttDead.

<b>ttttPIMM
</b>ttWhat now?

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttWe bury him so deep no one will
ttever find him.

<b>ttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. NIX'S .HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - DUSK
</b>
tThe wind has died away.  It's eerily calm.  Butterfield
tdashes towards camera, then halts. 

tHE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE
tinto the back of Murray Pimm's bus. 

tON Butterfield.  He watches, with a feral look on his face.

<b>ttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b>ttttFADE IN
</b>
<b>tEXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY
</b>
tThe city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and
tgleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking
tsome fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and
tcongestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.

tON SCREEN, the words:  "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"

<b>tEXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DAY
</b>
tThe facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs
ta lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but
tit has a certain charm.

<b>tINT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY
</b>
tA large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a
thost of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby. 
tAt the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands
tHARRY D'AMOUR.  He is having difficulty getting the pretty
tbut vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his
tname.

<b>ttttBLONDE GIRL
</b>ttHow'd you spell that again?

tHarry turns.  He's wearing a washed-out Grateful Dead t-

thandsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttYeah?

<b>tINT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
tOn the suit-case, which is now on the bed.  Harry flings it
topen.  Inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection
tof items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet.  A GUN.  A
tCRUCIFIX.  A STATUE of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of creation and
tdestruction. 

tON HARRY, as he heads into the bathroom.  Turns on the
tshower.  Starts to undress.

</b>ttYou bet.

<b>tEXT. MELROSE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
tHarry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a
tclassy restaurant.  It's RAINING.
tON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty
tWOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window. 
tTapert makes a joke (unheard).  The woman laughs. 

tON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape
trecorder.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttNine-eighteen p.m.  Tapert's either
ttgot a great sense of humour or he's

tOn Tapert, as he rises from the table.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttt(into tape recorder)

</b>ttOh my God!

tTapert emerges, his face white with terror.  He stumbles to
this car, and he's away.  Harry freezes, caught between the
tneed to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the
tlatter, and steps inside.

<b>tINT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>
tAn illuminated ARROW points up the stairs.  Harry ascends,
tpast faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.

tAt the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry
thalts, and takes out his GUN. 

tThere's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the
tcorner.  Harry chances a look.  There's a short length of
tpassageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a
tCRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is
tthe source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it
tfalls down the stairs. 

tDead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open
tdoor.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.  The fake antique
tFURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.

<b>tINT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tThere are two offices.  In the front, a Waiting Room, into
twhich Harry now steps.  Beyond it, through a door that stands
tnarrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room. 

tFrom out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.

<b>ttttQUAID (V.O.)
</b>ttAhh. . .

tHarry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for
this gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the
tshadows. 

tHis name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth
tsharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle
tof his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and
tgoes for his throat. 

tHarry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST
tand SMASHES it on Miller's skull. 

tMiller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the
tFortune Telling Room.

<b>ttttMILLER
</b>ttFuckhead.

<b>tINT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tA mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a
ttable.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been
ttortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude
tfrom his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the
ttable in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.

tHarry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttWhat the fuck!?

tHarry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the
tdoor.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttShit!

tHarry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. 

tAs he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A
tFIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his
tlate twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long
thair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -
tone black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. 
tHis hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttt(to Butterfield)
ttDon't touch him."

tButterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs
tin pain. 

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttWhat are you going to do about it? 

tMiller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
tother side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock
tout.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttt(to Harry)
ttEver watched a man die?  If you
ttwatch very closely, you can
ttsometimes see the soul escaping. 
ttAnd if you're very quick, you can
ttcatch it.

<b>ttttQUAID
</b>ttPlease... Butterfield... I wasn't
ttthere.  Ask Pimm.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttPimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
ttdisappeared.  They knew the Puritan
ttwas coming home. 

tAs this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the
tdoor and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other
tside.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being
tpitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of
tdefense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the
ttable.  Behind it a WINDOW.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttSo do you.  You've seen the future. 
ttHaven't you?

<b>ttttQUAID
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttAnd are you afraid?

<b>ttttQUAID
</b>ttYes.

tSuddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller
tCHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him
tagainst the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down
taround Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. 

tButterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the
tscalpel from his hands. 

tMiller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the
tfolds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's
tbelly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,
twhich SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. 

tHarry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already
tmaking his escape.  Harry starts after him.

<b>ttttQUAID
</b>ttt(to Harry)
ttDon't leave me.

tHe turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry
tgoes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the
tstairs.

</b>ttYou need an ambulance.

ttToo late.  Why are you here? Did

tQuaid takes hold of Harry's hand.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b><b>ttNO ... I...
</b>
tQuaid stares at Harry's HAND.  Fascinated, he momentarily
tforgets his pain.  He traces the lines with bloody fingers.

</b>ttt(quietly)
ttMy God.

</b>ttYou've taken some strange

tHarry takes his hand from Quaid's grip.  Quaid winces in
tpain.

tHe looks away, down at the CARDS.  All have been turned over

tCRANE DOWN from a looming STANDEE of Swann, perched above the
ttheatre marquee.  SPOTLIGHTS rake the skies. The sidewalk
tbelow is jammed with AUDIENCE MEMBERS, STAR-SPOTTERS and
tPHOTOGRAPHERS.  This is a flashy, prestigious event.  LIMOS
tare disgorging scantily- dressed STARLETS and smiling MONEY
tMEN; a NEWS TEAM is interviewing audience members as they
tfile in. 

tThe atmosphere is noisy and excited.  Amid the throng, Harry. 
tHe makes his way inside.

<b>tINT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>
tThe atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a
tconventional stage show.  Security people with walkie-
ttalkies roam the aisles; the audience buzzes with barely
tcontrolled hysteria. 

tHarry heads down the aisle, eyes on the stage.  A star-lit
tCURTAIN covers it.  Six rows from the stage is Dorothea,
talready in her seat.  She smiles lavishly, happy to see him.

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttI'm glad you could make it. 

tHarry takes a seat beside her.

tValentin emerges from the wings, patting the PANTHER that is

</b>ttI'm here.

tValentin nods.

tON SWANN, his expression unreadable.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttHe's young.

tMUSIC strikes up.  A dramatic, Wagnerian chord. Valentin
thurries away.  Swann's expression becomes very focused.

<b>tttt1ST TECHNICIAN
</b>ttt(to Swann)
ttReady?

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttReady.

tSwann rises up into the flies.

ttSo what is it?  Magic?

<b>tINT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe LIGHTS are DIMMING.  Harry glances across at Dorothea,
twhose gaze is intent. 

tThe LIGHTS go OUT.  The MUSIC SWELLS, and the CURTAINS fly
tapart.  A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to
tblast our senses!  Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride
tinto mystery.

<b>ttttSWANN (V.O.)
</b>ttLadies and gentlemen.  You are
ttstanding on the threshold of a
ttmiracle...

tA vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the
tstage. 

tThe vortex BLAZES -- 

tAnd suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor
tof the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor
ttoothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE. 

tSwann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR
tmiraculously appears in his grasp.  He descends on the
tdragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the
tDevil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. 
tThe theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.  Then the head cracks
topen, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily
tdressed DANCERS, male and female.  Swann throws down the
tspear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears. 

tA ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience.  Swann's plain white
ttunic falls away from him as he descends.  By the time his
tfeet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. 
tThe PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a
tcrescendo.  The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance.  In the
tsudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttMy friends ... come with me...into

tA barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt.

</b>ttYou haven't seen anything yet.

<b>tINT. WILTERN THEATRE - LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
tThe doors SQUEAK as a gust of WIND blows through them. 

tButterfield stands in the lobby, listening to the muted
tSOUNDS of MUSIC and APPLAUSE.  Then he offers his ticket to
tthe TICKET-COLLECTOR and steps inside.

<b>tINT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
tA new musical motif hangs in the air:  MUSIC announcing
tdanger. 

tThe AUDIENCE watches intently, nervously. 

tON HARRY and DOROTHEA.

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttt(a whisper)
ttThis is the new illusion.

tON STAGE, Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL, while the
tDANCERS, dressed like Boschian DEMONS, cavort around him,
tsomersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME. 
tIt's a scene from Daniels Inferno.  Above him. a dozen
tglittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending.  He
tstruggles to free himself.  The MUSIC gets more exciting as
tthe wheel spins faster and faster. 

tSuddenly, a sword DROPS.  It falls between Swann's
toutstretched legs, skewering the wheel.  Then ANOTHER, close
tto his head. 

tON HARRY.  He's tense.  Excited. 

tBACK TO STAGE.  Swann is free I  He throws off the last
tshackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the
twheel.  There's a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS.

tThe wheel slows.  He starts to step off it, as another of the
tthe swords DROPS. 

tThe AUDIENCE GASPS.  Swann smiles, and TRIPS. 

tAs he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back,
tcarrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning
thim there.  Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort.  Some
tstop. 

tMore GASPS from the audience. 

tON HARRY, having a -- 

tFLASHBACK:  Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card. 
tThe scene on the stage is that image coming to life.

</b>ttThere's something wrong... 

tON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a
tthird, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth,
tuntil TEN SWORDS have entered his body. 

tON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not.

tThe MUSIC has stopped.  In the silence, somebody GIGGLES
tnervously.  A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it
tdies away in a matter of moments.

<b>tON DOROTHEA AND HARRY
</b>
<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttNo. . .

tON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his
twife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death.  He
treaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead. 

tThere are GASPS now from the audience.  Murmurs of disgust;
tsobs of horror.

<b>tttt1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER
</b>ttWhat happened?

<b>tttt2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER
</b>ttIt's a trick.

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttt(to Harry)
ttI've got to get to him!

tThe AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've
tseen sinks in.  There is panic.  A few people have fainted. 
tOne or two are even praying. 

tHarry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea
tagainst the flood of the exiting crowd.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttOut of the way!  Out of the way!

tHe helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so
tshe can duck beneath it.

<b>tINT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
tChaos.  PEOPLE running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing
twatching.  Valentin is already at the body, with the STAGE
tMANAGER at his side.

</b>ttt(to Stage Manager)
ttGet then out of here, for God's
ttsake --

<b>ttttSTAGE MANAGER
</b>ttYou heard him!  It's not a fucking

tHe starts to physically push the crowd back.  Harry grabs his
tarm.

<b>ttttSTAGE MANAGER
</b>ttWho are you?

tHarry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE
tMANAGER out of Dorothea's way.  She goes to Swann's body,
twhich has been removed from the wheel.

<b>tINT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>
tThe audience is clearing now.  But Butterfield is coming
ttowards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he
tenraged?  Or puzzled?  Or both?

<b>ttttMILLER
</b>ttPsst!

tMiller stands at an open door, leading below the stage.

tButterfield enters.

tDorothea kneels at Swann's side.  A few yards from her, Harry
texamines the mechanism of the wheel.

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttt(softly)
ttSwann... 

tA DOCTOR appears.

<b>ttttDOCTOR 
</b>ttI'm a doctor.  Let me through. 

tThe Doctor checks Swann's body.

<b>ttttDOCTOR
</b>ttt(to Dorothea)
ttI'm sorry...

tHarry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. 
tHe's suspicious.  He slips round to the back of the
tmechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the
tcable as he goes.

<b>tWILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
tIt's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are
tused in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the
tbeginning.  From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted
tand echoing. 

tThe cable ends in bare wires.  Whatever was here has been
ttaken. 

tA NOISE, behind Harry.  He swings round.  Sees a shadowy
tFIGURE ducking away.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttHey!

tHe gives chase.  Loses the man in the shadows.  Stops and
tlistens for movement. 

tSuddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of
twood and smashes it into Harry's face!

tHarry reels back.  Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his
tnose.  Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.

<b>ttttMILLER
</b>ttGot you, fucker!

tHarry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  And now, out of
tthe dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield.

ttAll right.  It was...

tButterfield comes a little closer.

tt... it was...

tButterfield leans in.  And Harry grabs him by the balls --
tliterally -- rising as he does so.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttAah!

tHarry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground
tin agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from
tMiller, who's leveling Harry's gun. 

tHe FIRES once, missing Harry by inches.  Harry catches hold
tof a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who
tTOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  The GUN GOES
tOFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW
<b>tMECHANISM.

tMiller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the
tdragon's steel teeth.  He has Harry in his sights. 

t-- something CREAKS.  He looks up.  The dragon's jaw is
tclosing, FAST.  He starts to scramble to his feet.  Too late! 
tThe teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body.  Sudden death. 

tHarry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the
tshadows.  Then he's gone.  Harry looks down at Miller's
tBLOOD, which is pooling around his feet.

</b>
tA wonderland for illusionists.  Books, props, masks, tricks,

tall, then targets a MAN in late middle age, who is browsing
tthrough books, one-handed.  His other hand constantly
tmanipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen

</b>ttHarry... I know it's late.

tThere should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. 
tBoth of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by

</b>ttThat's okay.

<b>tEXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>
tThe Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry
theads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of
tQuaid's Waiting Room. 
tIt has been locked and taped by the police.  Harry has come
tprepared.  He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the
tlocks.

<b>tINT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT  
</b>
tHarry enters, FLASHLIGHT on.  He crosses the Waiting Room and
tenters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died.  On the

tMiller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the
tblood-spattered table:

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
</b>ttIf you watch very closely, you can

tHarry is spooked.  He starts to search the room, opening
tcabinets and drawers.  Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac
tare stashed everywhere.  Boxes of crystals, religious
tstatues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.

tHe pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged
tin a niche at the base of the drawer.  He pulls the drawer
tout, empties its contents on the table, and examines it. 

tUsing the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart.  It has a
tfalse bottom.

tHe flicks to "D."

</b>ttDesiderio...

tThere it is.  Jennifer Desiderio, and an address.  He pockets
tthe book.  Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out

tHarry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a
tbuilding, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".

<b>tINT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY
</b>
tThe place is bland and functional throughout, the walls
tdecorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings. 
tNothing disturbing.  Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER -
tblack, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse.

<b>ttttTOFFLER
</b>ttJennifer's only ever had one
ttvisitor.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttA Mister Quaid?

</b>ttRight.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I

</b>ttI won't say anything.

<b>tINT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY
</b>
tToffler excorts Harry through -the place.  There are
tdistressing scenes on every side.  Nothing melodramatic no
tscreaming, no fits.  Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair. 
tBlank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms.

<b>ttttTOFFLER
</b>ttJennifer's been with us four years. 
ttShe was coming on nicely. 
ttBut just the last month or so,
ttshe's worse than ever.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttWhat's her problem?

<b>ttttTOFFLER
</b>ttShe has no real grip on reality.

</b>ttt(a joke)
ttDoes anybody?

<b>ttttTOFFLER
</b>ttt(deadly serious)
ttOh yes.  We have to agree what's

</b>ttAnd what does Jennifer think's

tThey've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting

tHarry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the
tNurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout
tthe scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which
tsteadily gets louder as they walk.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttHave we met before?

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttOnly I forget.  They give me pills,

ttand... I forget things,

</b>ttWell, you didn't forget me.  I just

</b>ttMaybe... I... don't...

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttWhat about Philip Swann?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttI knew Swann.
ttt(sudden vehemence)
ttHe's a fucking liar.

tA WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttWhy's that?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttHe said he knew how to protect us. 
ttBut he didn't know anything.  He
ttmade us think it was over and done

</b>ttt(tears nearing)
ttI don't want to think about it. If

</b>ttSwann?

tAhead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,
tlaying pipes.  The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but
twe're aware of it.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttI told you.  I don't --

tShe stops.  Looks ahead of her.  Her face is suddenly ashen
tand clammy.  Harry follows her gaze to: 

tThe hole.  Somebody is in it, digging.  Earth emerges in
tshovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.

<b>ttttJENNIFER (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(screaming)
ttGod no!  Oh God no!

tShe backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her.

</b>ttCalm down!

tShe delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.  The Nurse is flung
tback.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>ttHe's not going to get me!

tShe races down towards the street.  Harry goes after her.

</b>ttNo.  He's coming back.  He's

tThe Nurse appears behind Harry.

<b>ttttNURSE
</b>ttI'll take care of her now.

tJennifer struggles in Harry's grip.

<b>ttttNURSE
</b>ttLet go of her, Mr. D'Amour!

tThe Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away
tinstantly, racing towards the street.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttJennifer!

tShe scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the
ttop.  There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of
tmetalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the
tNurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down.

<b>tHARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET
</b>
tJennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the
twheels of a car.  The DRIVER is out, and yelling
tincoherently. 

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttJesus.

tHe slips back down the wall, and leans against it.

tHe looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging. 
tHis mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his
thead appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
ta grave.  Harry closes his eyes.

ttWhoa...

tOn the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS.  In glass cases, the tools
tof the great magicians:  KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an
tIRON MAIDEN.  Billy is in awe.  He wanders around wide-eyed
twhile Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they
tinvestigate.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttI hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttYou heard right.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttYou ever been married?

<b>ttttHARRY

</b>ttWhy?

</b>ttMy life was too weird for her.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttBilly?  This was on Miller's

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttNope.

tHarry presses it.  The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttWhat did I tell you?  So fucking
tthokey.

tInside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttWhat have we got here?

tEver-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And -- 

ttwo spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! 

tHarry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from
tskewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his
tsinews straining.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttGrab the files!

tsteps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a

</b>ttI could have lost my fucking hands.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttThat would have kept you out of the

ttt(he studies the files)
ttWhich was presumably the idea.
ttt(a beat)
ttThese are about Nix.

tHarry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttYou go through these.  Go on!

tReluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded
tPHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil
tpainted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. 
tThere are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY
t-- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for
tthat) - is NIX.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttWait a minute...

tHe stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different
tcolours.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttThat's Butterfield...

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttt(points to nan in)

ttAnd who's that?

tON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. 

tON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttAt a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.

tBilly picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows
ta horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH
tof another man's HEAD.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttTake a look at this.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttt(looking at it)
ttA Nix specialty?

tBilly is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching
tdown and starts to go through others in the series.  We
tglimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a
tserpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at
this own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone
tbeneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see
ta HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating
<b>tDARKNESS.
</b>
<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttI don't know any of these tricks...

tHarry studies the etchings.

</b>ttt(a slow burn)

</b>ttt(mystified)
ttI mean, there's no instructions--
ttt(realizes what Harry said)
ttWhat do you mean, they're not
tttricks?

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttWhat did Vinovich say? Something
ttabout walking a path between --

</b>ttTrickery and divinity.  Yeah, he
ttsays that all the time.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttThat's because he knew.  He'd seen
ttthese files and knew.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttKnew what?

tOut of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the
tbook-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his
tlips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. 
tHarry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. 

tSomething eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A
tfigure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.

tHarry takes out his gun. 

tBilly disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry
tgoes after the apparition. 

tThe TRACK is completely silent. 

tSuddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up,
tits face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. 

tIt tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who
tbacks away.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttHarry!

tBooks tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the
tshelves.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttWhere the fuck are you?

tHarry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttOkay.  Hold it right there.

tThe gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made
tof smoke. 

tHarry waves his hands through it.  It's completely ethereal. 

tBut it's still terrorizing Billy.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttt(in mortal terror)
ttGet it off me!

tHarry glances around.  Sees a LIGHT flickering between some
tbooks.  FIRES at it.  The light goes out.  The "Psycho"
tvanishes.  Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttHokey enough for you?

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttI'm out of here, man!  Are you
ttcoming?

tHarry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttI'm coming.

tBilly is already out of the room.  For a moment. Harry pauses
tto look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked
tgates. 

tAs he does so --

t-- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the
t"Psycho" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.

tAs if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE
terupts behind Harry.  He swings round to see the Stranger
t"unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and
tphysiology to do so.  The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent
twrithing on the ground.  It comes at Harry.  Harry FIRES at
tit, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's
tleg.  He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a
tdoor, and flings it open.  He's in --

</b>
tThe FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand. 
tHarry drops the GUN.  Looks up to see the Stranger in the
tdoorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on.  But then,
the hesitates.  Harry glances round, and sees that the
tStranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at
tthe CASKET.

</b>ttSomebody you know?

tDorothea appears behind the Stranger.  Sees Harry, burned and

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttOh my God!

tThe Stranger looks round.  Harry snatches up the GUN,
tsupporting his burned hand with -his good hand.  Levels the
tgun at the Stranger.  The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.

</b>ttWhich goes first?  My face or

tThe Stranger draws a deep breath.  The Fire-Serpent withers

</b>ttAre you all right?

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttFind Valentin!  Find him!  Get him

tDorothea disappears.  Harry takes one of the candle-holders

tto force off the lid. 

tValentin and Dorothea enter.

<b>ttttVALENTIN
</b>ttWhat are you doing?  This is

tHe starts towards Harry.  Dorothea goes after him and catches
thold of his arm.  Her expression is a mingling of fascination
tand dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
tpulls. 

tInside, Swann's corpse.

<b>ttttVALENTIN
</b>ttAre you satisfied now?

</b>ttIt's all right.  It's not

</b>ttWas that Swann's idea?

</b>ttNo.  It was mine.  I didn't want

</b>ttNix is dead and buried, for

</b>ttHaven't you seen enough to know

tThe TOLLING carries over into

tWE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by
tMOURNERS.  The graveside service has just ended, and the
tMourners are beginning to disperse.  Dorothea is there
tamongst them, of course.  So are several faces we recognize: 
tVinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his
tDancers, his Technicians.  There are also several members of
tthe PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom,
tto judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists. 

tHarry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)
tfrom the doorway of a mausoleum.  His eyes are on Dorothea as
tshe goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of
tcondolesence.

t"died."  He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage.

tto the ground.

tHarry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing
tinto the building.  He glances back towards the street.  We
tget a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat. 

tHarry slides out of sight.  Waits until the Stranger has gone
tinside.  Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed
twire.

tHarry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of
tthe Stranger. 

tHe enters a shadowy room.  Birds fly UP into his face! 

tAs he retreats, another SOUND, a little distance from him. 
tGUN in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into

tHe has a bag open at his feet.  One by one he takes out a

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttWhy did you wait so long?

</b>ttI didn't have the skill to

tThere is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house.

tIt has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity. 
tWe DRIFT towards the front door.

tInside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle.  They are all
tCUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that
tblazes in the centre of the circle.  They hack
tindiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their
teyes wild.  BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked
tears and scalps.

twatching the work.  Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.

</b>ttAnything?

</b>ttIf you've lied to me to me --

</b>ttWhat the fuck are you playing at?

tHe goes to pick them up.  Dorothea steps from behind the

tCloser... 

tHe touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a

tThe house is silent now.

tWe TRACK through the house.  The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of
tthem, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum.

tON THE SANCTUM DOOR.  Butterfield emerges.  He is wearing
tWHITE now.

</b>ttBe ready.

tNow we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. 
tWith looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the
tbottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up
tMORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor
tsharp pieces of GLASS. 

tON Butterfield, smiling.  He steps back into the Sanctum.

tHIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the
tBODY of Nix.  It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL. 
tBandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  Beside its
thead, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out. 

tON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as
tshe watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed
tinto Nix's face.  He works with surgical precision.

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttListen.  You've got everything you
ttwant.  You don't need me. .. 

tA piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  A subtle
tPOWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. 
tWe CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on
toccasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these
tsigns of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttNo, but he will.  After what you
ttdid to him.

tHe pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.

</b>ttHe'll want vengeance.  Simple PS

tbreathless with anticipation.

tOn Nix's emaciated mouth.  The lips TWITCH. 

tOn Dorothea.  The DUST moves around her.

tOn Butterfield, TEARS in his eyes.

</b>ttOh my Lord.  He's coming home...

tON Dorothea, eyes wide.

tON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils. 
tHis withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to

</b>
tButterfield is watching the process in amazement. Nix's HANDS
tmove up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is

tUnnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea
tgets to her feet and creeps away to the door. Very quiet

</b>
tSuddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes
tcoiled around his face and fingers!

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttOh God!

tButterfield looks up. 

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttHold her!

tOn Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face.  It
tcomes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND.  At last, we see

tThe candle-lights blaze, BLINDING his sensitive eyes.

</b>ttt(fury to agony)
ttAaarrrgh!

tHe gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over
tall the lights but two.  Then he strikes Butterfield to the
tground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking
thim unconscious.  It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal
tdisplay of instant physical superiority.  Throughout, he
tliterally ROARS in rage.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

tfor the count.

</b>
tThe Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction.

</b>ttWill you suffer to come unto me?

tOne by one, the Cultists fall to their knees.  We never see
tflesh pierced by broken glass.  But we HEAR IT, and see the
tagony on the Cultist's faces.  They start to sob.

tThen, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.

</b>ttI've come back to share the wisdom
ttof the grave.  Will you hear it?

<b>ttttCULTISTS
</b>ttYes... yes...

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttFollow me then.

tHe steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of
tadoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttDo I know you, child?

tHe reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea
tkeeps her self-possession; but only just.

</b>ttHe'll come.  We've got unfinished

tThen he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation
tRoom, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the
twounds he's receiving. 

tThe Cultists follow.

tHarry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows. 
tHe is frozen by the memory of what happened here. 

tON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that
tterrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of

tHarry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked
tgrip.  He crosses to the door. 

tSuddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and
tcatches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. 

tHe has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at
tHarry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>

tWith a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath

tperhaps bottomless. 

tDorothea SCREAMS!

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

tHearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the

tfloats over the chasm below then.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttt(to unseen Cultists)
ttYou see, I escaped the grave. So I
tthave to give something to the grave

tOn the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their
teyes. 

tA SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the
tbridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
tthe library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS.  As Nix
tREVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the
tCultists.

tAt first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this
tis some kind of bizarre blessing. 

tThen the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.

<b>ttttNORMAN
</b>ttWhat's happening?

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttI have to give something back. So
ttI'm giving you.

tThey're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground. 
tThey struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry
tfor them.  They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK.

</b>ttt(sobbing)
ttWhy?  Why?

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttYou're not worthy.  None of you. 
ttOnly Swann was worthy. You just

tHarry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has
this back to Harry.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttWell I'm not your shepherd.

tHarry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground
tis now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have
tdisappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up
tout of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it
tdespite its horror.  SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid
tground.  TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix
tand Dorothea, GUN levelled.  So far, he has avoided Nix's
tgaze.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
</b>
tButterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. 
tThey tumble back against the table upon which Nix was
tresurrected.  It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann
tis stunned.  Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
tand STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of
ttime. 

tThe BLADE catches him in the arm, however.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttAah!

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttGo on, bleed.
ttt(he slashes at Swann
ttagain)
ttGo on!  Go on!

tButterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a
twall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across
tthe floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!

<b>ttttBUTTERFIELD
</b>ttt(screaming)
ttNo!

tHe falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to
twatch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD
trunning from his wound.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

tNix swings round.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttYou're not Swann.  Who are you?

ttOh... I know what you want. He lets

tHarry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of
tDorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN
tgoes spinning across the ground, back towards the door
tleading to the passageway.

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttOh God!

<b>ttttSWANN (V.O.)
</b>ttNix!

tNix looks up.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttThere you are. 

tSuddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He
tsteps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone
tsuddenly conversational.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttI've had a lot of time to think
ttabout you.  Where I went wrong...

tWith Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the
tchasm.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttAnd?

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttI should have been honest with you,
ttright from the start.  I wasn't

tON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door.  Harry glances
tback into the room.

</b>ttYou could still help me do that.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttWhy would I want to?

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttBecause you've got nothing else to

</b>ttNot true.

</b>ttThe woman has a new love in her

tHe launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttWill you help me?

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttYes.

tNix lets him go.

</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttBut until then... it's you and

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttYes.

tDorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.
tSwann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttWait... you still feel something
ttfor that bitch?

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttNo!

</b>ttLiar!

tNix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall,
tpinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttWill!  You!  Never!  Learn!?

tWith each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in
tSwann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,
tthey have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs. 
tThey CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs,
tone to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards
tDorothea.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttShe's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.
ttI'll show you!

tHe moves towards Dorothea.  Swann falls to the ground,
tbroken.

tThe fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.

<b>ttttSWANN (V.O.)
</b>ttHarry!  Stop him!

tHarry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and
trunning off into the darkness. 

tButterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time
tfor this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,
tand Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see
tthe impact.  HEARING it's enough. 

tHarry looks down at the body.  Then --

<b>ttttNIX (V.O.)
</b>ttWhere is she? 

tHarry turns.

tNix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's
tbody as he comes at Harry!

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttWhere did she go?

tNix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the
tfingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He
tstruggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.

tNix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's
ttemples.  As before, there's no blood.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttYou've got Swann's disease. You
ttthink a little courage, a little
ttlove, and it'll all be all right. 
ttWrong!

tHis fingers slide all the way in!

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttOh God!

tHarry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes
tare BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttTell me where she is... and I'll
ttmake it go away...

tHarry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.

<b>tHARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
tThe apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face
tSCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms! 

tON HARRY, verging on insanity.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttOh God... oh God...

<b>tHARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
tHarry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of
tsome glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY.  We can't see her
tface.  Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
tdevourer.

<b>tON HARRY

tReaching out for the image.

tHe starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is
tpainted.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttDorothea!  Dorothea!

<b>tHARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
tDarkness swallows the image of the woman.  She is still
tscreaming when she disappears.

tHarry stops.  Dare he believe this is truly her voice?

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttIt's not real, Harry-

tHarry turns around.  Dorothea is there.

<b>tHARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
tFor a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.

tON HARRY, relief flooding his face.  Then --

<b>tHARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
t-- the image MORPHS.  Dorothea's beauty is replaced by
tprimeval muck. 

tON HARRY, appalled.  Dorothea grabs hold of him.

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttHarry.  Listen to me. Whatever's
ttgood between us, believe it.

tHarry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT.  He's
tfighting the delirium.  Or doing his best.


<b>ttttHARRY
</b>tt... oh... God...

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttI'm here, Harry.

<b>ttttHARRY

tNix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.

ttThere you are, child. 

tHarry starts to look round.

</b>ttDon't look.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttCome on, child.  I want Swann to

tHarry turns and looks at Nix.

<b>tHARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
tNix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle
tof his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttt(to Harry)
ttWhat are you looking at?

tON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room
tand now slips inside. 

tON HARRY, staring up at Nix.

tON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her
thand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttt(points to his brow)
ttThere... there!

tON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. 

tON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES. 

tThe bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees,
tBLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE
tused to be.

tON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the
twall, shaking.

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttHarry?

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttI'm okay.  I'm okay.

tHarry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her.

<b>tHARRY'S P.O.V.
</b>
tThe last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she
tactually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they
tembrace. 

tSuddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him --

t-- it isn't over. 

tOne last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he
tkneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS
tup his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his
tforehead --

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttOne... last... illusion...

t-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of
tthe bullet wound.

<b>ttttDOROTHEA
</b>ttOh my God.

tHarry and Dorothea start to get up... 

tNix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS,
tstripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible
telement on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an
tutterly inhuman SHRIEK!

<b>ttttSWANN (V.O.)
</b>tt... D'Amour...

tHarry glances through the door into the Meditation Room.
tSwann is on the threshold. 

tNix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk
tsomehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. 

tHe comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into
tthe Meditation Room.

<b>tINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tThe pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is
tbacked towards it by Nix. 

tWhen Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is
<b>tDEMONIACAL.
</b>
<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttI am the purest of the pure.  I am
ttthe darkest of the dark...

tHarry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttHarry.  You can't kill him. 

tHarry crouches beside Swann.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttt(whispers)
ttHe did something with the ground.

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttYes?

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttCan you do it?

<b>ttttSWANN
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttTry.

tON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now.

<b>ttttNIX (V.O.)
</b>ttI'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond
ttHell.

tSuddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. 
tNix topples.

tON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground.  Closes his eyes. 

tA wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's
tbroken fingers -- 

t-- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like
tcorpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces
tresurfacing --

tBarbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over       
tthe edge of the pit.

<b>ttttHARRY
</b>ttt(to Dorothea)
ttGet out of here!

tThe ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging
taround Nix as they're all carried towards the pit.  So's
tHarry, of course. 

tNix tries to get up, but he's too late.  The corpses weigh
thim down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper
thold, and Harry still clings to his legs.

<b>ttttNIX
</b>ttNo!  No!  No!

tHe's at the edge of the pit.

<b>ttttDOROTHEA (V.O.)
</b>ttHarry!

tHarry looks round.  Dorothea's behind him, risking the
tflowing ground to offer him a hand. 

tNix starts to fall into the pit.  At the last minute, he
treaches for Harry, as -- 

t-- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea. 

tTogether they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies. 
tThey look back to see 

tNIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING. 

tAt the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head.  He's dead. She
tcloses his eyes.

tNix is falling through rock.  Still SCREAMING.  He CRASHES
tagainst a layer of stone, which his body smashes to
tsmithereens.  And as he falls --

tNo it's not.  Nix keeps falling, breaking through another
tlayer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the
tearth. 

tAnd now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below.  He's
tapproaching MAGMA.
