<b>ttttOLD KIM
</b>ttSnuggle in, sweetie. It's cold out there.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttGRANDDAUGHTER
</b>ttWhy is it snowing, grandma? Where does it come 
ttfrom?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttOLD KIM
</b>ttOh, that's a long story, sweetheart.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttGRANDDAUGHTER
</b>ttI want to hear.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttOLD KIM
</b>ttOh, not tonight. Go to sleep.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttGRANDDAUGHTER
</b>ttI'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttOLD KIM
</b>ttWell, all right. Let's see. I guess it would 
tthave to start with scissors.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttGRANDDAUGHTER
</b>ttScissors?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttOLD KIM
</b>ttWell, there are all kinds of scissors. And once 
ttthere was even a man who had scissors for 
tthands.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttGRANDDAUGHTER
</b>ttA man?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttOLD KIM
</b>ttYes.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttGRANDDAUGHTER
</b>ttHands, scissors?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttOLD KIM
</b>ttNo, scissorhands. You know the mansion on top 
ttof the mountain?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttGRANDDAUGHTER
</b>ttIt's haunted.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttOLD KIM
</b>ttWell, a long time ago, an inventor lived in 
ttthat mansion. He made many things, I suppose. 
ttHe also created a man. He gave him inside, a 
ttheart, a brain, everything. Well, almost 
tteverything. You see, the inventor was very old. 
ttHe died before he got to finish the man he 
ttinvented. So the man was left by himself, 
ttincomplete and all alone.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttGRANDDAUGHTER
</b>ttHe didn't have a name?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttOLD KIM
</b>ttOf course, he had a name. His name was Edward.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttAvon calling.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttWeren't you just here?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttNo, not since last season. Today I've come to 
ttshow you our exquisite new line of soft colors 
ttin shadows, blushes and lipstick. Everything 
ttyou need to accent and highlight your changing 
ttlooks.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttMy changing looks? That's good.
ttt(Helen chuckles)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttWell, it goes that saying and I also have a 
ttcomplete selection of your old favorites, those 
tttried-and-true products we've all come to 
ttdepend on year-in and year-out.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttCome on, Peg. I never buy anything from you. 
ttYou know that?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttI know. Bye, Helen.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttREPAIRMAN
</b>ttYou know, you didn't have to call me, ma'am. 
ttYou could have taken care of this by yourself.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttI could? I don't think so.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttREPAIRMAN
</b>ttYeah, you see, it's easy. The food trap's 
ttclogged. That's all. You see this bolt here? 
ttYou just unscrew this. OK? And out she pops.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttYou know, on TV they say you repairmen are 
ttlonely bunch of people. Housewives get lonely 
tttoo. Although you may not realize it since they 
tthaven't made a commercial on the subject.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttREPAIRMAN
</b>ttAnd then you just take this and put it back in 
tthere nice and easy. Be careful not to force it, 
ttbecause it fits in there by itself. And then 
ttyou just screw this back on.
ttt(The bell rings.)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttOn no! Who could that be? Will you excuse me 
ttfor a moment? Now. Don't go anywhere. I'll be 
ttright back. This is fascinating. I wouldn't 
ttwant to miss a moment of it.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttGood morning, Joyce. Avon calling.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttWhy! Peg. Have you gone blind? Can't you see 
ttthere's a vehicle in my driveway?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttOh, yes.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttWell, I'm surprised you don't realize that 
ttmeans I'm busy. 
ttt(Joyce shuts the door with a 
tttbang.)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttOkay. Now, we should decide on lipsticks. Okay, 
ttdear, what one did you like best? There was the 
ttWinsome Wahini which looked charming on you. Or 
ttthe Bahenie Bliss.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttA GIRL
</b>ttI like them both.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttWell, great.

ttyou?

</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttIt's just not my day.

tttthrough her rearview mirror and

tttattracted by the beautiful garden 
tttthere and enters the mansion.)

ttOh my! I can see that I've disturbed you. How

</b>ttI'm-I'm sorry.

</b>ttDid you get a good look?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttMARGIE
</b>ttNo, did she say anything to you, about having 
ttguest?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttShe didn't say anything. She rang my doorbell

ttt(A woman talks on the phone)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttA WOMAN
</b>ttJoyce, I just saw this strange guy drop in with 
ttPeg. I didn't get a very good look at him. He 
ttlooked kind of pale. Okay, I'll be right there. 
ttDon't do anything without me. Okay? Bye.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttYes, I'll be right there.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttHere we are. So, oh, this is the living room 
ttand back here, the bedrooms. You want to see 
ttthe pictures? All right. Well, this is my 
tthusband, Bill. He's a bowling champion. Do you 
ttknow what bowling is? Bowling? Well, here they 
ttare down at the lake, fishing. I think Kevin 
ttlooks a little glum Because they didn't catch 
ttanything that day. And here's my daughter, Kim. 
ttAll dressed up the junior prom. She's a senior 
ttnow. I can't believe it. She's camping in the 
ttmountains with some friends, but she'll be back 
ttin a few days and you can meet her then. Isn't 
ttshe beautiful? That's my family. Now, go on, 
ttdear. I'll show you the rest of the house. Then 
ttyou can just freshen up and make yourself at 
tthome. Okay? That's the kitchen over there. You 
tthelp yourself to anything you want to eat or 
ttdrink. Those are grapes. Back here are the 
ttbedrooms. Let me get you some towels, then I 
ttwill see what we can find to wear. You know

ttin here. This is perfect. Here. These should 
ttjust fit you. 
ttt(The phone rings.)
ttOh, no, no. Don't be alarmed. That's just a

ttthese on. I'll be right with you.
<b>tt

</b>ttNo, no, scissors. That's right. Well, he was 
ttborn up there or something. Have you seen him

ttt(to Edward)
ttI'm sorry Edward, I didn't... oh, dear. May I

ttYou've got rollers in your damn hair.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttOkay. Now what did I do with my sci... Edward, 
ttum, would you. Thank you. I have a doctor 
ttfriend who I think could help you.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttReally?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttYes, I can help with the scars. I just want to 
ttconsult the Avon handbook before doing 
ttanything.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttKevin, it's not polite to stare. Think how it 
ttwould make you feel if somebody were staring at 
ttyou.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttI wouldn't care.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttWell, I would, so don't do it!
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttThis must be quite a change for you, Ed.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttI think he prefers Edward.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttSure. So what have you been doing up there in 
ttthat big old place? I bet the view must be 
ttspectacular, Ed.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttI was just...

</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttSee all the way to the ocean?

</b>ttSometimes.

</b>ttBill, could I have the salt and pepper? Thank 
ttyou.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttMan, those things are cool. You know I bet 
ttthey're razor sharp. One karate chop to a guy's 
ttneck...

</b>ttWould you like some butter for your bread?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttGreat.

</b>ttI've had enough.

</b>ttt(to Edward)
ttYou think you can sleep? Things feel strange 
ttnow, but soon you'll feel right at home. Good 
ttnight.
ttt(Peg tries to cover Edward's 
tttscars.)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttThe light concealing cream goes on first, then 
ttyou blend and blend and blend. Blending is the 
ttsecret. More concealing for you? But you 
ttcomplexion is so fair. Now this has a touch of 
ttlavender in it. Give it a try here. Close 
ttenough. OK. This should do the trick here. I 
tthave another idea. We'll cover up the scars and 
ttstart with a completely smooth surface. Don't 
tteat this stuff!  Sports announcements on

<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWho is he? What are you talking about?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttEdward's come to live with us. There's nothing 
ttto be upset about. No, no. It's okay.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttWe'll have you a setup here in a minute. Up 
ttwith your feet. A queen-size bed here. How do 
ttyou like that? It's all made up and everything. 
ttThere you go. What's the matter? What's wrong? 
ttShe gets you nervous? You've been closed up in 
tta way in that castle too long.  You don't know 
ttanything about the wonderful world of teen-age 
ttgirls. They're all crazy. Here some. Straighten 
ttthat out.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttWhat is it?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttLemonade. I don't know what it is. They reach a 
ttcertain age. They develop these gland things. 
ttTheir bodies swell up. They go crazy.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttGlands?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttyeah, glands. I try not to think about it
ttt(Edward drinks lemonade.)
ttGood. Isn't it?
ttt(Peg calms down Kim.)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttNow you stay in Kevin's room tonight. Tomorrow 
ttwe'll fix your room right.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttMom, why did you have to bring him in here?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttOh, honey, I couldn't have left him there all 
ttalone. You would have done the same thing.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWhy does he have to stay here?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttOh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you. He 
ttcan't help the way he is. Have a little 
ttsympathy.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttI do have a little sympathy.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttThen let's just say hello and later you can 
ttcome downstairs and shake his hand.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttShake his hand?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttWell, not literally. Goodness, you scared him 
tthalf to death.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttI scared him to death?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttHi, Bill. I just wanted you two to have a 
ttproper introduction. Edward, this is our 
ttdaughter Kim.  Kim, this is Edward who's going 
ttto live with us.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttHi! 
ttt(Edward falls on the floor.)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttt(to Edward)
ttEddie. Thirsty? 
ttt(to Kisses)
ttKisses, Hush up. Quiet now. I can hardly hear 
ttmyself think. Momma's precious little baby 
ttgirl.
ttt(to Edward)
ttWouldn't you like a nice cool glass of

ttThey're the sharpest things in the world. They

<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttI think they look weird. They give me the 
ttcreeps.

</b>ttYou should see the clown in front of Ms.

<b>tt

</b>ttKim!
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttOh, no!
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttA GIRL
</b>ttThat's him?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttHe's calling you, Kim.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttStop it.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttA WOMAN
</b>ttEdward, you forgot your cookies.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttDon't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for you.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttA GIRL
</b>ttLet's go.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttBill, you know what Edward told me? He had 
ttlunch at Jackie's today.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttReally?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttShe's just had her kitchen completely redone.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttI'll be darned.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttNew paint, new cabinets, new floors, new 
ttmicrowave, new Sonnet dishwasher.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttYeah, isn't that wonderful?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttIsn't that something? Jim, didn't you tell me 
ttyour mom had her kitchen done too?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttYeah, my dad bought himself a bunch of new 
tttoys. Big screen TV, CD players, VCR with four 
ttheads.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttMy goodness sake! I wonder what it's like to be 
ttthat rich.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttNo, they keep things pretty much locked up. My 
ttfather has his own room for his stuff to make 
ttsure I can't get and use it. He's so cheap he 
ttwon't help me buy my own car.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttWell, he probably wants you to pay for it 
ttyourself. I agree with him. It builds 
ttcharacter. You'll appreciate it more. Speaking 
ttof money, I understand you are not charging for 
ttgardening, Edward?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttNow, Bill. Margie made him cookies today.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttSweetheart, you can't buy the necessities of 
ttlife with cookies. You can't buy car with 
ttcookies. Am I right, Jim?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttAh, that's true, sir. You can't.
ttt(Edward gives a piece of meat to 
tttKim's friend.)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttA GIRL
</b>ttI can't eat that. He used his hands. I don't 
ttthink it's sanitary.
ttt(Edward passes the piece to Kim 
tttbut drops it in her lap by 
tttmistake.)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttI'm sorry.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttHoney, you want me to help you clean that up?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttNo, that's okay. I'll be right back. 
ttt(Edward begins styling women's

</b>ttThis can't possibly be my Alexis.
ttt(to Edward)
ttShe looks so beautiful. Look at you. She's 
ttgorgeous. Thank you.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttIt won't be long. She has just to decide on the 
ttstyle, and then it will be fine. She just has 
ttto decide what style she wants.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttI was hoping for something big and bouffant. 
ttKind of like mine. Don't you worry , Kisses. 
ttYou'll be so pretty. Eddie, is there anything 
ttyou can't do? You take my breath away. I swear. 
ttLook at this. Have you ever cut a woman's hair? 
ttWould you cut mine? That was the single most 
ttthrilling experience of my whole life.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttWe're getting the head of the company.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttI'm home.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttHi, honey. We're in here.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttHi! What did you do to your hair?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttEdward cut it. Isn't it wild? 
ttt(on telephone)
ttHello. Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you 
ttin person. This is such an honor. Yes. He's 
ttright here. Great. So then you know all about 
ttit. Aha. That's exactly what I've been using. 
ttWell, I've had a little trouble getting it to 
ttthe right consistency. Yeah, right. just a 
ttlittle. I'll try that. Well, what imaginative 
ttsuggestions! I sure will. Thank you so much. 
ttBye bye.
ttt(to Edward)
ttNo wonder she's the head of the company. You 
ttknow, she started out as a sales representative 
ttjust like me. I've always wanted to talk to her 
ttbut until now I never had a reason. Thanks, 
ttEdward.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttShe had some ideas?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttYou bet she did.
ttt(At the Airport)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttMARGIE
</b>ttI'll get that.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttMARGIE
</b>ttEdward! We're here. Come on. Let's get you 
ttsharpened up.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttYou got it?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttNo, I can't believe this. 
ttt(Kim sees Edward coming.)
ttDo you have a key?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttNo.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttI could have sworn I put it in here somewhere.

</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttWell, we're stranded. 
ttt(Edward opens the locked door with

<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWow! Thanks.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttEd, what a guy! Good job. Hey, you didn't break 
ttit or scratch it or anything. Hey, be a pal and

<b>tt
</b><b>ttttTV HOST
</b>ttQuite a story, yes? Any questions for Edward? 
ttYeah, get way over. Stand right up.
<b>tt

<b>tt

</b>ttAny other questions?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttWOMAN 2
</b>ttHave you ever thought of having corrective

ttmight be able to help you.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttI'd like to meet him.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttTV HOST
</b>ttWe'll give that name after the show. Thank you 
ttvery much. That's very nice. Anyone else? Yes, 
ttstand right up.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttWOMAN 3
</b>ttBut if you had regular hands you'd be like 
tteveryone else.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttYes, I know.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttTV HOST
</b>ttI think he'd like that.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttWOMAN 4
</b>ttThen no one would think you're special. You 
ttwouldn't be on TV or anything.

</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttNo matter what, Edward will always special.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttTV HOST
</b>ttMore questions? Stand right up.

</b>ttThere's an idea. Anyone else? Yeah.

</b>ttDo you have a girl friend? Ahh.
ttt(Living room in Peg's)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttSure, he does. Right, Kim?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttNow you got him started.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttKnock it off, bubble- butt.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttYou did it.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttSo?
ttt(On the TV Show)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttTV HOST
</b>ttHow about it? Is there some special lady in 
ttyour life?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttTV HOST
</b>ttUh, everything's all right. He'll take a break 
ttand we'll be right back after these messages.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWhy are you laughing? He got hurt.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttIt was a little shock. Ha! Ha! Ha!
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttA little shock?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttI wish we'd been taping that. I'd give my left 
ttnut to see that again.
ttt(Edward in beauty salon)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttAren't you excited? Oh, this is just so 
ttthrilling. Wait till I show it to you. It's 
ttjust perfect. It's just what we've been looking 
ttfor. I want to call it "Shear Heaven." Here we 
ttare. No, all along here I'm going to put a row 
ttof new mirrors. Back up here a whole row of new 
ttcosmetics.
<b>ttt(TV 1/4x8c)
</b>ttAll along this row here.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttPeg could sell cosmetics.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttSure. This is where I stand when I greet the 
ttcustomers. Back in here is what I really want 
ttto show you. This is the storeroom for 
ttsupplies. What I need from you today is to help 
ttme make a decision. Don't, that's dangerous. 
ttYou just sit down right there. I have some 
ttsmocks. Would you like me to model them? This 
ttis my favorite because it's yellow. And what 
ttit's for is to catch itchy little trimming that 
ttfall down your neck. Then there's this old 
ttpurple one, you know, you kind of drape around 
ttyou like this.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttI like that one.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttYou're trembling. So am I. I've been waiting 
ttfor this moment for so long. Edward! Edward, 
ttyou come back here! You can't do that!
ttt(In the Restaurant)
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttVeloro. Veloro. Sweetheart. That hangs on the 
ttdash board.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttI've never seen that.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttSorry I'm late.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttHi, Edward. Sorry. We had to go ahead without 
ttyou. Here you go.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttSo, Edward, did you have a productive day?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttMrs. Monroe showed me where the salon is going 
ttto be. You could have a cosmetic counter.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttWouldn't that be great?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttGreat.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttAnd then she showed me the back room where she 
tttook all of her clothes off.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttEdward. I can't tell you how thrilled I am.  
ttI'm just as pleased as Punch. This whole beauty 
ttparlor, that's what's going to teach you 
ttvolumes. There's nothing like running your own 
ttbusiness. I've never done it myself, but from 
ttwhat I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a 
ttworking man can have. So I guess the bank is 
ttgoing to be your next step, huh?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttThe bank?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttYeah, take out a loan. Get yourself started. 
ttNothing to worry about. With your talent and 
ttreputation, it's going to be a snap. Now.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBANK CLERK
</b>ttNo credit, no record of jobs you've held, no 
ttsavings, no personal investment, no social 
ttsecurity number. You may as well not even 
ttexist. There is no collateral.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttYou know. We already have a second on the 
tthouse, but don't the testimonials make a 
ttdifference?  Did you see here, the mayor's wife 
ttcan't wait to become a client?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBANK CLERK
</b>ttWe simply can't do it. Now get yourself a 
ttsocial security card. Establish credit and buy 
ttyourself a car. You have the side to advantage. 
ttYou can get one of those handicapped placards. 
ttNo problem. Park anywhere you like.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttPEG
</b>ttI can't believe it. Really, it's just an 
ttoutrage. Don't you worry. This isn't the end of 
ttit. We'll get your money somewhere.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttBut that's breaking and entering.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttLook. My parents have insurance up the rear. 
ttOkay? And all it will cost them is a little 
tthassle. That's about it. In a week my dad will 
tthave new and better everything.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWe can't.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttLook. There's a guy who will give us cash for 
ttthe stuff.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttJim, I don't want to.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttWell, do you want to ride around in a van like 
ttDenny's, and we could be by ourselves whenever 
ttwe like? With a mattress in the back?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWhy can't you just do it?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttBecause my father keeps the damn room locked, 
ttand we need Edward to get us in.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWhy can't you take the key like when he's 
ttsleeping or something?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttLook, you don't understand, everything he 
tthandcuffs or ties will do anything for you.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWhat do you mean?  That's not true.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttOh, no? Why don't you ask him?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttThat's not fair.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttWhat's fair got to do with it? There isn't any 
ttother way.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttThere got to be.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttLook. I've racked my brain. Don't you want us 
ttto have our own van?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttYeah.  Jim, the lights are on.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttThose go on automatically. They've gone for the 
ttweekend. I told you. That's right.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttDENNY
</b>ttThis burglar scared.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttYou turned off the alarm. Am I right?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttYes, everything, come on. Let's go. Come on.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttI can't believe this is happening.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttA GIRL
</b>ttAre you sure he doesn't know this is Jim's 
tthouse?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttHe's never been here.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttThis person stole from you?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttKeep your voice down. I told you he stole it. 
ttRight? Come on. Let's go.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttHis parents will make him give it back.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttListen, I've already tried that. The guy's 
ttparents are like he is. Okay? Now, you told Kim 
ttyou'd do this. Well, come on. Let's go. Come 
tton. Come on. Come on.
ttt(Edward picks the lock and the 
tttdoor opens, but when he steps into 
tttthe room the alarm works and the

</b>ttNo way!
<b>tt

</b>ttJim, it's your house. They can't arrest you for

<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttI'm not going back there. Okay?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWe have to go back.
<b>tt

</b>ttNo, because my father will prosecute.

ttWhat in god's name was going through your mind,

</b>ttOh, I blithely say, "We'll get money for the

ttWere you scared? I tried to make Jim go back,

</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttYou are welcome.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttIt must have been awful when they told you 
ttwhose house it was.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttI know it was Jim's house.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttYou did?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttYes.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttWell, then why did you do it?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttEDWARD
</b>ttBecause you asked me to.

<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttDon't.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttWhat's the matter with you? When you are going

ttWhat more do you want from me?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttYou could tell the truth.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttJIM
</b>ttSo could do. You were there, too.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttIt wasn't my idea. You know I didn't want to do 
ttit.

</b>ttBut you did do it. I don't get why you give 
ttsuch a shit anyway.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttWell, we are going to try to help you find a 
ttway to replace the drapes and the towels, but 
ttour confidence in you, Edward, is not going to 
ttbe so easy to replace.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttDad!
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttBILL
</b>ttOkay, a little ethics. You are walking down the 
ttstreet. You find a suitcase full of money. 
ttThere's nobody around. No human person is in 
ttevidence. What do you do? A
ttYou keep the money. B
ttYou use it to buy gifts for your friends and 
ttyour loved ones. C
ttYou give it to the poor. D
ttYou turn it into the police.

</b><b>ttttKIM
</b>ttThat is really stupid.

ttthe nicer thing to do. That's what I would do.

ttmight be best if he goes back up there. Because

ttto normal.
