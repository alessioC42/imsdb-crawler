</b>
<b>6tINTtNEW UNI HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY - CARMEN IBANEZ
</b>
tis beautiful, just 18, and quite pleased with herself  because
tJohnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her.

<b>ttttRASCZAK (O.S.)
</b>ttThe end of another school year, and for 
ttme no doubt another failure...
ttRico, pay attention !

tThe teacher JEAN RASCZAK, 38, a rugged veteran who proudly
tdisplays his missing hand, scowls at Johnny, bemused.

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttSorry, Mr. Rasczak.

tBut as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class, Johnny begins to sketch
ta cartoon on his desk's touch screen.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttHere in History and Moral Philosophy
ttwe've explored the decline of 
ttDemocracy when social scientists brought
ttthe world to the brink of chaos, and how thet
ttveterans took control and imposed a stability 
ttthat has lasted for generations since...
ttYou know these facts but have I taught you
ttanything of value ? You.
ttWhy are only citizens allowed to vote ?

tRasczak points at LANNY, 17, with his stump
<b>.
</b><b>ttttLANNY
</b>ttIt's a reward... what the Federation gives you
ttfor doing Federal Service.

tRasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttNo. Something given has no value !
ttHaven't I taught you dimwits anything ?
ttI guess they ought to revoke my 
ttteaching credential...

tLaughter. Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape:
tJohnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttWhen you vote, you're exercising political
ttauthority. You're using force. And force, my
ttfriends, is violence, the supreme authority
ttfrom which all other authority derives.

tCARL JENKINS, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttGee, we always thought you were the
ttsupreme authority, Mr. Rasczak.

tLaughter. Rasczak grins.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttIn my classroom, you bet. Whether it's 
ttexerted by ten or ten billion, political 
ttauthority is violence by degree. The 
ttpeople we call citizens have earned
ttthe right to wield it.

tDIZZY FLORES, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.

<b>ttttDIZZY
</b>ttMy mother always says that violence
ttnever solves anything.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttReally ? I wonder what the city fathers of
ttHiroshima would have to say about that.
ttYou.

tRasczak points at Carmen.

<b>ttttCARMEN
</b>ttThey probably wouldn't say anything.
ttHiroshima was destroyed.

tJohnny presses xb4"SEND" on his desk, and the cartoon appears
tacross the way on Carmen's screen.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttCorrect. Naked force has settled more
ttissues in history than any other factor.
ttThe contrary opinion 'violence never
ttsolves anything' is wishful thinking
ttat its worst.

tWhile Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful
tsmile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttPeople who forget that always pay...
ttThey pay with their lives and their
ttfreedom.

tDizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face.
tSo does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump,
tsnaps Johnny to.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttYou. Tell me the moral difference,
ttif any, between the citizen and the civilian ?

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttThe difference lies in the field of civic
ttvirtue. A citizen accepts personal
ttresponsibility for the safety of the body politic,
ttof which he is a member, defending it,
ttif need be, with his life.
ttThe civilian does not.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttThe exact words of the text. But do
ttyou understand it ?
ttDo you believe it ?

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttUh, I don't know.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttOf course you don't. I doubt if any 
ttof you here would recognize 'civic virtue'
ttif it bit you in the ass.

tA bell rings. Rasczak shrugs, indifferent.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttWell, that's it. Have a nice life.

</b>ttHold on... I wanna talk to Marco.

tCarmen rushes off. Johnny checks his score:t35% ! Crushed, he

</b>ttDon't have to... Some mating semaphore

tIt's true. You can tell by the way she looks at Johnny.

<b>ttttJOHNNY

tCarmen returns to Johnny as Carls heads off.

<b>ttttBIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>ttFor our final today, please identify the mouthparts,
ttthe abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the
ttnerve cord and count the ganglia.
ttYou may begin.

tThe students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs, 60
tcentimeter ARKELLIAN SAND BEETLES laid out for dissection.

<b>ttttCARMEN
</b>ttEeuch !

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttAw, c'mon, it's just a bug.

<b>ttttBIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>ttJust a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are
ttNature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't 
tttrue. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many
ttways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself
ttin vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and
ttmortality, makes the perfect selfless member of 
ttsociety.

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttBetter put your goggles on.

tJohnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green
tfluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill.

<b>ttttBIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>ttOur galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have
ttidentified over two billion species so far.
ttHuman, life, it would seem, is the anomaly.

<b>ttttCARMEN
</b>ttBut we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented
ttart, mathematics and interstellar travel.

<b>ttttBIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>ttTrue, we know of no insect society that has
ttproduced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a
ttCherynkov, but before you let that go to your
tthead, take the example of the Arachnids, a 
tthighly organized, highly evolved insect society.

tShe points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a
tcommon ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR.

<b>ttttBIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>ttThey are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers
tthave an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the 
ttArachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years
ttof evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the 
ttbiological means to hurl their spore into space.

tJohnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity 
topen with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out.

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttWell, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric
ttcaecal...

tthe six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttDon't think about it... go on instinct.

</b>ttAce of spades.

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttHow do you make him do that ?

<b>ttttCARL

toverrun when Johnny touches down wuth Ace and Dizzy.

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttLooks like you've got a little bug
ttproblem, ma'am...

<b>ttttBIRDIE
</b>ttStow it, trooper. Give it verything

tThe cao troopers let the bugs have it, but the insects keep coming, the living
tcrawling over the dead, and now, trudging up out of the ground, comes a
<b>tTANKER BUG.
</b>
<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b><b>ttWATCH OUT !
</b>
tThe tanker bug starts to spray, creating a toxic perimeter around the hole.
tRasczak arrives just as Birdie takes a chemical hit, falling to ground minus
tan arm, screaming.

<b>ttttBIRDIE
</b><b>ttAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
tJohnny jumps, landing behind the tanker bug in the mouth of the hole. It turns 
twith surprising speed. Johnny flips up onto its back, cracks its armor with his
tpulse cannon.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttSugar, in for pick up !

tRasczak and Sugar Watkins pull Birdie to safety. Johnny fires a rocket into 
tthe hole he's made in the tanker bug's back, and jumps clear. KA-WHAP !
tThe big bug explodes.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttGas that hole and close it !

tThe Roughnecks fire gas rockets into the bug hole. Johnny touches down
tbeside Rasczak.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttWhere'd you learn to do that, soldier ?

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttUni High Tigers, sir. Don't you

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttI'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico,
ttI need a corporal. You're it until you're
ttdead or I find someone better.

tRasczak turns away, gives Birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past
tto meet an arriving skimmer.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttDon't worry, Birdie, your next arm comes
ttwith a factory guarantee !

tDizzy and Ace gather around Johnny, clap him on the back.

</b>ttI'm gonna need a squad leader.

tTac Fighters reel by over head. WOMP ! Suddenly, BUG PLASMA shoots skyward
tfrom the flatlands below. Several Tac Fighters are blown out of the air.
tFlaming debris rains down.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttSaddle up, Roughnecks. That's

tRoughnecks head out on the bounce.

tpit some ten meters across. Inside, something is moving.

<b>ttttJOHNNY
</b>ttWhat kind of stinkin' bug is that ?

tJohnny jumps the magnification on his "head up". Down in the pit, a giant
ttranslucent PLASMA BUG rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels
tthat ring the battery.

<b>ttttSUGAR WATKINS
</b>ttYou never seen how they do it before ?

tJohnny shakes his head. Swollen BREEDER BUGS gather around the 
tplasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly.

<b>ttttACE
</b>ttAgghh ! It's making me sick...!

tThe plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell, color changing from
tyellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction.

<b>ttttSUGAR WATKINS
</b>ttIt's gonna pop !

tWOMP ! The plasma bug explodes in its cauldron. A blast of bug plasma
tstreaks past them towards the heavens. Now a new plasma bug crawls into
tthe pit to begin the cycle anew.

<b>ttttGILLESPIE
</b>ttSir, look !

tSergeant Gillespie points. A hole opens near the battery and dozens of warriors
trampage out of the ground and up the cliff face toward the Roughneck position.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttWe must be right over the colony.
ttLet's get some air support, eh ?

<b>ttttGILLESPIE
</b>ttYes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck

tRasczak moves off down the line giving orders.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttCorporal, I want pulse cannons there

</b>ttThey'd rather spend our lives than

<b>ttttDIZZY
</b>ttThat'd be me, sir.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttHeat it up.

tDizzy activates a tactical nuke. It makes a distinctive HIGHPITCHED SQUEAL.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b>ttRoughnecks, you may fire at will.

tThe Roughnecks open fire. Bugs are blown to pieces but they keep climbing. A 
twarrior breeches their line. Sugar Watkins torches it. The nuke's ready light flashes.

<b>ttttDIZZY
</b>ttI'm hot, sir !

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b><b>ttFIRE ! BLAST SHIELDS DOWN !
</b>
tJohnny blows a warrior away from the edge. Dizzy leans over and fires. The rocket 
tstreaks down toward the battery.

<b>ttttRASCZAK
</b><b>ttHIT THE DIRT !
</b>
tAn explosion in the two kiloton range turns the world black and white. When color
treturns Johnny and the others look down on the smoldering crater which was once the 
tbug battery.

</b>ttNow comes the part I hate the most.

tThe life is leaving her eyes.

</b>ttHang on, Diz... don't die on me...

tA TANKER BUG breaches the broken wall. Ace jumps out to help his

</b>ttPlease continue, Sergeant.
