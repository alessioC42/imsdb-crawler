<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT.  PARK - DAY
</b>
Brief shot of duel.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tMy father, who was well-known to the
tbest circles in this kingdom under
tthe name of roaring Harry James, was
tkilled in a duel, when I was fifteen
tyears old.

<b>EXT.  GARDEN - DAY
</b>
Mrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a
distance.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tMy mother, after her husband's
tdeath, and her retirement, lived in
tsuch a way as to defy slander.  She
trefused all offers of marriage,
tdeclaring that she lived now for her
tson only, and for the memory of her
tdeparted saint.

<b>EXT.  STREET - DAY
</b>
Mother and son walking together.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tMy mother was the most beautiful
twomen of her day.  But if she was
tproud of her beauty, to do her
tjustice, she was still more proud of
ther son, and has said a thousand
ttimes to me that I was the
thandsomest fellow in the world.

<b>EXT.  CHURCH - DAY
</b>
Mother and son entering church.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tThe good soul's pleasure was to
tdress me; and on Sundays and
tHolidays, I turned out in a velvet
tcoat with a silver-hilted sword by
tmy side, and a gold garter at my
tknee as fine as any lord in the
tland.  As we walked to church on
tSundays, even the most envious souls
twould allow that there was not a
tprettier pair in the kingdom.

<b>EXT.  FIELD - DAY
</b>
A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tMy uncle's family consisted of ten
tchildren, and one of them was the
tcause of all my early troubles; this
twas the belle of the family, my
tcousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.

<b>EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY
</b>
A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,
stables, barn and farm.

Idealized images of Dorothy.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAh!  That first affair, how well one
tremembers it!  What a noble
tdiscovery it is that the boy makes
twhen he finds himself actually and
ttruly in love with some one!  A lady
twho is skilled in dancing or singing
tnever can perfect herself without a
tdeal of study in private.  So it is
twith the dear creatures who are
tskilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for
tinstance, was always practicing, and
tshe would take poor me to rehearse
ther accomplishments upon...

Dorothy talking with the exciseman.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>t... or the exciseman, when he came
this rounds.

Dorothy talking to the steward.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>t... or the steward.

Dorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a
book.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>t... or the poor curate.

Dorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>t... or the young apothecary's lad
tfrom Dugan's Town whom I recollect
tbeating once for that very reason.

Roderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tThe torments of jealousy she made me
tendure were horrible.

<b>EXT.  FIELD - DAY
</b>
Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of
confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,
runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,
returning every moment to Roderick.

She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then
laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless
and staring at her.

After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she
challenges Roderick to a race.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI accept, but I insist on a wager.
tThe loser must do whatever the
twinner pleases.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tAgreed.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tDo you see the gate at the end of
tthe field?  The first to touch it
twill be the winner.

They line up together and start on a count of three.
Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,
and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of
him.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI was certain to win, but I meant to
tlose to see what she would order me
tto do.

Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then
she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes
out and says:

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tYour penalty is to find a cherry-
tcolored ribbon which I have hidden
tsomewhere on my person.  You are
tfree to look for it anywhere you
twill, and I will think very little
tof you if you do not find it.

They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her
pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then
her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and
circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears
upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he
draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The
tickling makes her laugh.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI feel the ribbon.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tThen you must get it.

Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty
breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tWhy are you shaking?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tWith pleasure at finding the ribbon.

<b>EXT.  FIELD - DAY
</b>
Military review.  One hundred English troops, a few
mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local
people.

The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best
and Grogan.

Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAbout this time, the United Kingdom
twas in a state of great excitement
tfrom the threat generally credited
tof a French invasion.  The noblemen
tand people of condition in that and
tall other parts of the kingdom
tshowed their loyalty by raising
tregiments of horse and foot to
tresist the invaders.  How I envied
tthem.  The whole country was alive
twith war's alarums; the three
tkingdoms ringing with military
tmusic, while poor I was obliged to
tstay at home in my fustian jacket
tand sigh for fame in secret.

<b>INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT
</b>
Dorothy and Roderick entering.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tOnce, the officers of the Kilwangen
tregiment gave a grand ball to which
tDorothy persuaded my to take her.

Several cuts depicting the evening.

Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks
punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.

Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss
Clancy.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI have endured torments in my life,
tbut none like that.  Some of the
tprettiest girls there offered to
tconsole me, for I was the best
tdancer in the room, but I was too
twretched, and so remained alone all
tnight in a state of agony.  I did
tnot care for drink, or know the
tdreadful comfort of it in those
tdays; but I thought of killing
tmyself and Dorothy, and most
tcertainly of making away with
tCaptain Best.

<b>EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN
</b>
The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAt last, and at morning, the ball
twas over.

<b>EXT.  ROAD - DAWN
</b>
Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tSure it's a bitter night, Roderick
tdear, and you'll catch cold without
ta handkerchief to your neck.

To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle
made no reply.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tDid you and Miss Clancy have a
tpleasant evening, Roderick?  You
twere together, I saw, all night.

To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,
and giving a lash to Daisy.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tOh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and
tthrow me, you careless creature,
tyou.

The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's
waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!
tAnd I only danced with her because
t-- because -- the person with whom I
tintended to dance chose to be
tengaged the whole night.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tI had not been in the room five
tminutes before I was engaged for
tevery single set.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tWere you obliged to dance five times
twith Captain Best, and then stroll
tout with him into the garden?

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tI don't care a fig for Captain Best;
the dances prettily to be sure, and
tis a pleasant rattle of a man.  He
tlooks well in his regimentals, too;
tand if he chose to ask me to dance,
thow could I refuse him?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tBut you refused me, Dorothy.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tOh!  I can dance with you any day,
tand to dance with your own cousin at
ta ball as if you could find no other
tpartner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain
tBest's a man, and you are only a
tboy, and you haven't a guinea in the
tworld.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tIf ever I meet him again, you shall
tsee which is the best man of the
ttwo.  I'll fight him with sword or
twith pistol, captain as he is.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tBut Captain Best is already known as
ta valiant soldier, and is famous as
ta man of fashion in London.  It is
tmighty well of you to fight farmers'
tboys, but to fight an Englishman is
ta very different matter.

Roderick falls silent.

<b>EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN
</b>
They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,
sufficiently deep and rocky.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tSuppose, now, Roderick, you, who are
tsuch a hero, was passing over the
tbridge and the enemy on the other
tside.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI'd draw my sword, and cut my way
tthrough them.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tWhat, with me on the pillion?  Would
tyou kill poor me?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tWell, then, I'll tell you what I'd
tdo.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,
tand swim you both across, where no
tenemy could follow us.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tJump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare
tto do any such thing on Daisy.
tThere's the captain's horse, Black
tGeorge, I've heard say that Captain
tBes --

She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual
recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tHold tight to my waist!

And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the
parapet, into the deeper water below.

The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she
sinks, and screams as she rises.

Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.

<b>INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Various cuts showing illness and convalescence.

Roderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.

Mother brings a tray of food.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI went home, and was ill speedily of
ta fever, which kept me to my bed for
ta week.

Dorothy visiting him.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tDorothy visited me only once, but I
tquitted my couch still more
tviolently in love than I had been
tever before.

<b>EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY
</b>
The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud
amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs
down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.

He encounters an orderly whistling "Roast Beef of Old
England," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tWhose horse, fellow, is that?

<b>tttORDERLY
</b>tFeller, indeed!  The horse belongs
tto my captain, and he's a better
tfellow nor you any day.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI did not stop to break his bones,
tas I would on another occasion, for
ta horrible suspicion had come across
tme, and I made for the garden as
tquickly as I could.

Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path
together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and
squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling
against his arm.

Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying
court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tThe fact is that, during the week of
tmy illness, no other than Captain
tBest was staying at Castle Dugan,
tand making love to Miss Dorothy in
tform.

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tNo, Dorothy, except for you and four
tothers, I vow before all the gods,
tmy heart had never felt the soft
tflame.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tAh, you men, you men, John, your
tpassion is not equal to ours.  We
tare like -- like some plant I've
tread of -- we bear but one flower,
tand then we die!

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tDo you mean you never felt an
tinclination for another?

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tNever, my John, but for thee!  How
tcan you ask me such a question?

Raising her hand to his lips.

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tDarling Dorothea!

Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI pulled out a knot of cherry-
tcolored ribbons, which she had given
tme out of her breast, and which
tsomehow I always wore upon me, and
tflung them in Captain Best's face,
tand rushed out with my little sword
tdrawn.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tShe's a liar -- she's a liar,
tCaptain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend
tyourself, if you are a man!

Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while
Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.

Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.

Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small
by the side of the enormous English captain.

Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back
clutching at his sword.

Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,
screaming:

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tCaptain Best, for Heaven's sake,
tspare the child -- he is but an
tinfant.

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tAnd ought to be whipped for his
timpudence, but never fear, Miss
tDugan, I shall not touch him, your
tfavorite is safe from me.

So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of
ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and
handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tWhen ladies make presents to
tgentlemen, it is time for other
tgentlemen to retire...

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tGood heavens, Best!  He is but a boy
tand don't signify any more than my
tparrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a
tbit of ribbon to my own cousin?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (roaring)
tI'm a man, and will prove it.

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tYou are perfectly welcome, miss, as
tmany yards as you like.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tMonster!  Your father was a tailor,
tand you are always thinking of the
tshop.  But I'll have my revenge, I
twill!  Roddy, will you see me
tinsulted?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tIndeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to
thave his blood as sure as my name's
tRoderick.

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tI'll send for the usher to cane you,
tlittle boy, but as for you, miss, I
thave the honor to wish you a good
tday.

Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low
bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's
cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by
the scream.

<b>tttMICHAEL
</b>tHoity-toity!  John Best, what's the
tmatter here?

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tI'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.
tI have had enough of Miss Dugan here
tand your Irish ways.  I ain't used
tto 'em, sir.

<b>tttMICHAEL
</b>tt   (good-humoredly)
tWell, well!  What is it?  We'll make
tyou used to our ways, or adopt
tEnglish ones.

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tIt's not the English way, for ladies
tto have two lovers, and, so, Mr.
tDugan, I'll thank you to pay me the
tsum you owe me, and I resign all
tclaims to this young lady.  If she
thas a fancy for school-boys, let her
ttake 'em, sir.

<b>tttMICHAEL
</b>tPooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tI never was more in earnest.

Best exits.

<b>tttMICHAEL
</b>tt   (in a towering rage)
tYou -- you!  Hang you for a meddling
tbrat, your hand is in everybody's
tpie.  What business had you to come
tbrawling and quarreling here, with
ta gentleman who has fifteen hundred
ta-year?

Michael runs after Best.

<b>tttDOROTHY
</b>tt   (gasps)
tOh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I
tshall never leave this spot.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tt   (whisper to Dorothy)
tThe Captain is gone.

Dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks
towards the house.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tt   (in a soothing tone
tt    to Roderick)
tThis is a pretty way to recommend
tyourself to the family.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (shouts after
tt    Michael)
tThe man that marries Dorothy Dugan
tmust first kill me -- do you mind
tthat?

<b>tttMICHAEL
</b>tt   (shouting back from
tt    a distance)
tPooh, sir.  Kill you -- flog you,
tyou mean!  I'll send for Nick the
thuntsman to do it.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tYou are a gallant lad, and I like
tyour spirit.  But what Dugan says is
ttrue.  It's a hard thing to give a
tlad counsel who is in such a far-
tgone state as you; but, believe me,
tI know the world, and if you will
tbut follow my advice, you won't
tregret having taken it.  Dorothy
tDugan has not a penny; you are not a
twhit richer.  And, my poor boy,
tdon't you see -- though it's a hard
tmatter to see -- that she's a flirt,
tand does not care a pin for you or
tBest either?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tDorothy might love me or not, as she
tlikes, but Best will have to fight
tme before he marries her!

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tFaith, I think you are a lad that's
tlikely to keep your word.

He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he
walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he
goes through the old gate out of the garden.

When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he
flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made
believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and
bursts into a passion of tears.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI must have sat for some hours
tbemoaning myself on the garden-bench,
tfor the dinner-bell clanged as usual
tat three o'clock, which wakened me
tfrom my reverie.

<b>EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY
</b>
As Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's
saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious
red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the
scullion-girls and kitchen people.

<b>tttMAID
</b>tThe Englishman's still there, Master
tRoderick.  He's there in the parlor.
tGo in, and don't let 'im browbeat
tyou, Master Roderick.

<b>INT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the
big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.

<b>tttUNCLE
</b>tHello, Roddy, my boy!  Up and well?
tThat's right.

<b>tttAUNT
</b>tHe'd better be home with his mother.

<b>tttUNCLE
</b>tDon't mind her.  It's the cold goose
tshe ate for breakfast -- didn't
tagree with her.  Take a glass of
tspirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's
thealth.

It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what
happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,
and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his
side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and
Roderick looks on as cold as stone.

His uncle is in high good-humor.

<b>tttUNCLE
</b>tDorothy, divide that merry thought
twith the captain!  See who'll be
tmarried first.  Jack Best, my dear
tboy, never mind a clean glass for
tthe claret, we're short of crystal
tat Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and
tthe wine will taste none the worse.
tMrs. Dugan and ladies, if you
tplease; this is a sort of toast that
tis drunk a great deal too seldom in
tmy family, and you'll please to
treceive it with all the honors.
tHere's to Captain and Mrs. John
tBest, and long life to them.  Kiss
ther, Jack, you rogue; for faith,
tyou've got a treasure.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (spring up)
tHis already?!

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tHold your tongue, you fool -- hold
tyour tongue!

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (shouting)
tHe has already been slapped in the
tface this morning, Captain John
tBest; he's already been called a
tcoward, Captain John Best; and this
tis the way I'll drink his health.
tHere's your health, Captain John
tBest.

Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next
moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who
hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he
hardly has time to hear the general screaming and
scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully
occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which
Harry is belaboring him.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tYou fool!  You great blundering
tmarplot -- you silly beggarly
tbrat --
tt   (a thump at each)
tHold your tongue!

When Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are
all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the
captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut
across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.

<b>tttUNCLE
</b>tIn Heaven's name, what does all the
trow mean?  Is the boy in fever
tagain?

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tt   (turning to his
tt    father)
tThe fact is, sir, that the young
tmonkey has fallen in love with
tDorothy, and finding her and the
tcaptain mighty sweet in the garden
ttoday, he was for murdering Jack
tBest.

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tt   (bristling up)
tAnd, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan,
tI've been insulted grossly in this
thouse.  I ain't at all satisfied
twith these here ways of going on.
tI'm an Englishman, I am, and a man
tof property; and I -- I --

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tIf you're insulted, and not
tsatisfied, remember there's two of
tus, Best.

On which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,
and answering never a word.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (in dignified tone)
tMr. Best may also have satisfaction
tany time he pleases, by calling on
tRoderick James, Esquire, of
tJamesville.

His uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain
Grogan joins.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tCaptain Grogan, I beg you to
tunderstand that, for my cousin
tHarry, who has been my best friend
tthrough life, I could put up with
trough treatment from him; yet, even
tthat sort of treatment I will bear
tfrom him no longer; and any other
tperson who ventures on the like will
tnot like the cost.  Mr. Best knows
tthat fact very well; and, if he's
tman, he'll know where to find me.

<b>tttUNCLE
</b>tIt is getting late, and your mother
twill be anxious about you.  One of
tyou had better go home with him.
tt   (turning to his sons)
tOr the lad may be playing more
tpranks.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tBoth of us ride home with Best here.

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST

tman is armed, and so am I.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tYou know the use of arms very well,
tBest, and no one can doubt your
tcourage; but Michael and I will see
tyou home for all that.

<b>tttUNCLE
</b>tWhy, you'll not be home till
tmorning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good
tten miles from here.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tWe'll sleep in Best's quarters.
tWe're going to stop a week there.
tAnd, in another week, my boy.

And here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tI'll go home with the boy.

<b>EXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY
</b>
Grogan walks with Roderick.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tA pretty day's work of it you have
tmade, Master Roderick.  Knowing your
tuncle to be distressed for money,
tand try and break off a match which
twill bring fifteen hundred a-year
tinto the family?  Best has promised
tto pay off the four thousand pounds
twhich is bothering your uncle so.
tHe takes a girl without a penny -- a
tgirl that has been flinging herself
tat the head of every man in these
tparts these ten years past, and
tmissing them all, and a boy who
tought to be attached to your uncle
tas to your father.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tAnd so I am.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tAnd this is the return you make for
this kindness!  Didn't he harbor you
tin his house when your father died,
tand hasn't he given you and your
tmother, rent-free, your fine house
tof Jamesville yonder?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tMark this, come what will of it, I
tswear I will fight the man who
tpretends to the hand of Dorothy
tDugan.  I'll follow him if it's into
tthe church, and meet him there.
tI'll have his blood, or he shall
thave mine.  Will you take my message
tto him, and arrange the meeting?

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tWell, if it must be, it must.  For a
tyoung fellow, you are the most
tbloodthirsty I ever saw.  No
tofficer, bearing His Majesty's
tcommission, can receive a glass of
twine on his nose, without resenting
tit -- fight you must, and Best is a
thuge, strong fellow.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tHe'll give the better mark.  I am
tnot afraid of him.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tIn faith, I believe you are not; for
ta lad I never saw more game in my
tlife.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy.
tYou're after my own soul.  As long
tas Jack Grogan lives, you shall
tnever want a friend or a second.

They embrace.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tPoor fellow!  He was shot six months
tafterwards, at Minden, and I lost
tthereby a kind friend.  But we don't
tknow what is in store for us, and
tthat's a blessing.

<b>EXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY
</b>
Mother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tIn spite of my precautions to
tsecrecy, I half-suspected that my
tmother knew all from the manner in
twhich she embraced me on my arrival,
tand received our guest, Captain
tGrogan.

His mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every
now and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tBut she would not say a word about
tthe quarrel, for she had a noble
tspirit, and would as lief have seen
tany one of her kindred hanged as
tshirking from the field of honor.

<b>INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Roderick waking up.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI never slept sounder in my life,
tthough I woke a little earlier than
tusual, and you may be sure my first
tthought was of the event of the day,
tfor which I was fully prepared.

Roderick at table with paper and ink.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAnd now I sat down and wrote a
tcouple of letters; they might be the
tlast, thought I, that I should ever
twrite in my life.

See him write:  "Dearest Mother."

<b>INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tThen I went down to breakfast, where
tmy mother was waiting for me, you
tmay be sure.  We did not say a
tsingle word about what was taking
tplace.

Roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in
helping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother
starts up with a scream.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tThank God, it's fallen towards me!

And then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAh!  They have their faults, those
tmothers; but are there any other
twomen like them?

There is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on
the mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late
father.

A pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture.

Roderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are
bright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and
gunpowder.

<b>EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Captain Grogan and Orderly arrive.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tHave you taken my message to him?

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tThe meeting is arranged.  Captain
tBest is waiting for you now.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tMy mare is saddled and ready; who's
tthe captain's second?

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tYour cousins go out with him.

Roderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI didn't take leave of Mrs. James.
tThe curtains of her bedroom-windows
twere down, and they didn't move as
twe mounted and trotted off.

<b>EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</b>
They ride their horses at a leisurely pace.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tThat's a very handsome sword you
thave there.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tIt was with this sword that my late
tfather, Harry James, God rest his
tsoul, met Sir Huddelstone
tFuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet,
tand was fatally run through the
tneck.  He was quite in the wrong,
thaving insulted Lady Fuddelstone,
twhen in liquor, at the Brentford
tAssembly.  But, like a gentleman, he
tscorned to apologize.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tAnd now you risk the same fate.  If
tyou are killed, your mother is all
talone in the world.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI am Harry James' son, and will act
tas becomes my name and quality.

<b>EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY
</b>
Harry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best,
flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a
grenadier company.  The party are laughing together.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (to Captain Grogan)
tI hope to spoil this sport, and
ttrust to see this sword of mine in
tthat big bully's body.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tOh, it's with pistols we fight.  You
tare no match for Best with the
tsword.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI'll match any man with the sword.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tBut swords are today impossible;
tCaptain Best is -- is lame.  He
tknocked his knee against the
tswinging park gate last night, as he
twas riding home, and can scarce move
tit now.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tNot against Castle Dugan gate, that
thas been off the hinges these ten
tyears.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tIt must have been some other gate.

They alight from their horses, and join and salute the
other gentlemen.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tI have just explained to Mister
tJames that Captain Best is lame, and
tthat swords are impossible.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tOh, yes!  Dead lame.

Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while
Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tAnd very lucky for you, Roderick, my
tboy.  You were a dead man else, for
the is a devil of a fellow -- isn't
the, Grogan?

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tA regular Turk.  I never yet knew
tthe man who stood to Captain Best.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tHang the business.  I hate it.  I'm
tashamed of it.  Say you're sorry,
tRoderick.  You can easily say that.

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tIf the young feller will go to
tDublin, as proposed...

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize
t-- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as
tto hell!

Grogan takes him aside.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tLook here, Roderick, my boy; this is
tsilly business.  The girl will marry
tBest, mark my words; and as sure as
tshe does, you'll forget her.  You
tare but a boy.  Best is willing to
tconsider you as such.  Dublin's a
tfine place, and if you have a mind
tto take a ride thither and see the
ttown for a month, here are twenty
tguineas at your service.  Make Best
tan apology, and be off.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tA man of honor dies, but never
tapologizes.  I'll see the captain
thanged before I apologize.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tt   (with a laugh to
tt    Grogan)
tThere's nothing else for it.  Take
tyour ground, Grogan -- twelve paces,
tI suppose?

<b>tttCAPTAIN BEST
</b>tt   (in a big voice)
tTen, sir, and make them short ones,
tdo you hear, Captain Grogan?

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tDon't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the
tpistols.
tt   (with some emotion
tt    to Roderick)
tGod bless you, my boy; and when I
tcount three, fire.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tThis is not one of my pistols.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tThey are all right, never fear.
tIt's one of mine.  Yours will serve,
tif they are needed, for the next
tround.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tRoderick, fire at his neck -- hit
thim there under the gorget; see how
tthe fool shows himself open.

Michael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain
retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.

It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover
his man well.

Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are
given.

At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most
horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.

<b>tttTHE SECONDS
</b>tt   (crying out)
tHe's down!  He's down!

Running towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes
his head.

<b>tttMICHAEL
</b>tHe's hit here, in the neck.

Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under
his gorget.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tHow is it with you?

The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support
of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once
more and falls backwards.

<b>tttMICHAEL
</b>tt   (with a scowl)
tThe young fellow has begun well.
tYou had better ride off, young sir,
tbefore the police are up.  They had
twind of the business before we left
tKilwangan.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tIs he quite dead?

<b>tttMICHAEL
</b>tQuite dead.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tThen the world's rid of a coward.
tIt's all over with him, Roddy -- he
tdoesn't stir.

He gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his
foot.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tWe are not cowards, Grogan, whatever
the was!  Let's get the boy off as
tquick as we may.  Your man shall go
tfor a cart, and take away the body
tof this unhappy gentleman.  This has
tbeen a sad day's work for our
tfamily, Roderick James, and you have
trobbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tIt was Dorothy did it.

Roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his
waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the
body of Captain Best.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tThere!  Take her those ribbons.
tShe'll know what they mean; that's
tall that's left of her of two lovers
tshe had and ruined.

<b>tttMICHAEL
</b>tAnd now, in Heaven's name, get the
tyoungster out of the way.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tI'll go with you.

They mount up and gallop off.

<b>EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Upon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who
has been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild
screams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces
him.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI need not tell you how great was my
tmother's pride and exultation when
tshe heard from Harry's lips the
taccount of my behavior at the duel.

<b>INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY
</b>
Still much excitement and hustle and bustle.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tThe boy must go into hiding, for a
tshort time anyway.  Dublin is the
tbest place for him to go, and there
twait until matters are blown over.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tDublin?  But the poor lad has never
tbeen away from home.  He will be as
tsafe here as in Dublin.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tI wish that were true, Auntie dear,
tbut I'm afraid the bailiffs may
talready be on their way from
tKilwangan.

<b>INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
His mother is rushing about and packing a valise.  Harry
sits on the bed.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tHarry persisted in the necessity of
tinstant departure, in which
targument, as I was anxious to see
tthe world, I must confess, I sided
twith him; and my mother was brought
tto see that, in our small house, in
tthe midst of a village, escape would
tbe impossible, and capture would be
timpossible to avoid.

<b>INT.  MOTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
His mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire, and
gives Roderick twenty golden guineas.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tt   (gravely)
tRoderick, my darling, my wild boy, I
thave forebodings that our separation
tis to be a long one.  I spent most
tof all night consulting the cards
tregarding your fate in the duel, and
tall signs betoke a separation.  Here
tis twenty guineas -- all that I have
tin the world -- and I want you to
tkeep your father's sword and
tpistols, which you have known to use
tso like a man.

<b>EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Roderick's departure.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tShe hurried my departure now, though
ther heart, I know, was full, and
talmost in half-an-hour from my
tarrival at home, I was once more on
tthe road again, with the wide world,
tas it were, before me.

Roderick waves.  His mother cries.

<b>EXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY
</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tNo lad of seventeen is very sad who
thas liberty for the first time, and
ttwenty guineas in his pocket; and I
trode away, thinking, I confess, not
tso much of the kind of mother left
talone, and of the home behind me, as
tof tomorrow, and all the wonders it
twould bring.

Roderick happily riding down the road.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI had no doubts of the future;
tthinking that a man of my person,
tparts, and courage, could make his
tway anywhere.  So I rode on, singing
tto myself, or chatting with the
tpassersby; and all the girls along
tthe road said, "God save me, for a
tclever gentleman."

Farm girls in the fields flirting with him.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAs for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan,
tthere seemed to be a gap of a half-
ta-score of years.

<b>EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY
</b>
A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,
with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts
his horse alongside.

<b>tttARMED GENTLEMAN
</b>tGood day to you, young sir.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tGood morning.

<b>tttARMED GENTLEMAN
</b>tWhere are you bound for?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (after a long look at
tt    his companion)
tThat is none of your business.

<b>tttARMED GENTLEMAN
</b>tIs your mother not afraid on account
tof the highwayman to let one so
tyoung as you travel?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (pulling out a
tt    pistol)
tNot at all, sir.  I have a pair of
tgood pistols that have already done
texecution, and are ready to do it
tagain.

At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed
gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick.

<b>EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY
</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tA little later on, as I rode towards
tKilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant
tpeople assembled round a one-horse
tchair, and my friend in green, as I
tthought, making off half-a-mile up
tthe hill.

A footman howls, at the top of his voice.

<b>tttFOOTMAN
</b>tStop thief!

But the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and
make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just
befallen.

<b>tttCOUNTRY FELLOW #1
</b>tSure, you might have kept him off
twith your blunderbush!

<b>tttCOUNTRY FELLOW #2
</b>tO the coward!  To let the Captain
tbate you, and he only one eye!

<b>tttCOUNTRY FELLOW #3
</b>tThe next time my lady travels, she'd
tbetter leave you at home!

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tWhat is this noise, fellows?

Roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the
carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his
whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off.

Pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance
to the chair-window.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tWhat has happened, madam, to annoy
tyour ladyship?

<b>tttMRS. O'REILLY
</b>tOh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am
tthe wife of Captain O'Reilly
thastening to join him at Dublin.  My
tchair was stopped by a highwayman;
tthis great oaf of a servant-man fell
tdown on his knees, armed as he was,
tand though there were thirty people
tin the next field, working, when the
truffian attacked, not one of them
twould help but, on the contrary,
twished him "good luck."

<b>tttCOUNTRY FELLOW #1
</b>tSure, he's the friend of the poor,
tand good luck to him.

<b>tttCOUNTRY FELLOW #2
</b>tWas it any business of ours?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (shouting)
tBe off to your work, you pack of
trascals, or you will have a good
ttaste of my thong.
tt   (to Mrs. O'Reilly)
tHave you lost much?

<b>tttMRS. O'REILLY
</b>tEverything -- my purse, containing
tupwards of a hundred guineas, my
tjewels, my snuff-boxes, watches.
tAnd all because this blundering
tcoward fell to his knees...

<b>tttFOOTMAN
</b>tBe fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much.
tDidn't he return you the thirteen
tpence in copper, and the watch,
tsaying it was only pinchbeck?

<b>tttMRS. O'REILLY
</b>tDon't be insolent, or I'll report
tyou to the Captain.

<b>tttFOOTMAN
</b>tSorry, ma'am.

He shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction
that the Captain has vanished.

<b>tttMRS. O'REILLY
</b>tThat fool didn't know what was the
tmeaning of a hundred-pound bill,
twhich was in the pocket-book that
tthe fellow took from me.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI am riding to Dublin myself, and if

<b>tttMRS. O'REILLY
</b>tBut I shouldn't like to put you to

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tO'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

<b>EXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY
</b>
They stop at the inn.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (very gallantly)
tAs you have been robbed of your
tpurse, may I have permission to lend
tyour ladyship a couple of pieces to
tpay any expenses which you might

tThat's very kind of you, Mr.

He gives her two gold pieces.

<b>INT.  INN - DAY
</b>
Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal.

We will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tHow different was her lively rattle
tto the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan
tassemblies.  In every sentence, she
tmentioned a lord or a person of
tquality.  To the lady's question
tabout my birth and parentage, I
treplied that I was a young gentleman
tof large fortune, that I was going
tto Dublin for my studies, and that
tmy mother allowed me five hundred
tper annum.

<b>tttMRS. O'REILLY
</b>tYou must be very cautious with

tmeet in Dublin, where rogues and
tadventurers of all countries abound.
tI hope you will do me the honor of
taccepting lodgings in my own house,
twhere Captain O'Reilly will welcome
twith delight, my gallant young
tpreserver.

Paying the bill.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tPerhaps had I been a little older in
tthe world's experience, I should
thave begun to see that Madame
tO'Reilly was not the person of
tfashion she pretended to be; but, as
tit was, I took all her stories for
ttruth, and, when the landlord
tbrought the bill for dinner, paid it
twith the air of a lord.  Indeed, she
tmade no motion to produce the two
tpieces I had lent her.

<b>EXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT
</b>
They ride by.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAnd so we rode on slowly towards
tDublin, into which city we made our
tentrance at nightfall.  The rattle
tand splendor of the coaches, the
tflare of the linkboys, the number
tand magnificence of the houses,
tstruck me with the greatest wonder;
tthough I was careful to disguise
tthis feeling.

<b>EXT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DUBLIN - NIGHT

</b>tWhich O'Higgins do you know?  For I

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tAh -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine

tand a bottle of as good claret as
tany in Ireland?  Betty, clear these
tthings from the table, and make the

tconcerning the highest personages of
tthe city, with whom, according to
thimself, the captain lived on terms
tof the utmost intimacy.  Not to be
tbehind hand with him, I spoke of my

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tHad I been an English lad, the

tBut we are not particular in Ireland
ton the score of neatness, hence the

tstrike me so much.

Broken door.

thasp to fasten it to?

Dress lying over bed.

</b>tI needn't ask whether you had a

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAfter breakfast, we drove out to
tPhoenix Park, where numbers of the
tyoung gentry were known to Mrs.

tpresented me in such a complimentary
tway that, before half an hour, I had
tgot to be considered as a gentleman
tof great expectations and large
tproperty.

<b>INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI had little notion then that I had
tgot amongst a set of impostors --
tthat Captain O'Reilly was only an
tadventurer, and his lady a person of
tno credit.  The fact was, a young
tman could hardly have fallen into
tworse hands than those in which I
tnow found myself.

An evening of gambling.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tTheir friends were always welcome on
tpayment of a certain moderate sum
tfor their dinner after which, you
tmay be sure, that cards were not
twanting, and that the company who
tplayed did not play for love merely.

Various cuts of the characters present.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tWhat could happen to a man but
tmisfortune from associating with
tsuch company?  And in a very, very
tshort time I became their prey.

Roderick loses two hundred guineas to Captain O'Reilly in
a single hand.

We see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not.

He pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum
his mother gave him.

</b>tI shall have to write out a note for
tthe rest of it, Captain O'Reilly.

<b>EXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN

Roderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling
can still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by
Councillor Mulligan.

<b>tttCOUNCILLOR MULLIGAN
</b>tMaster Roderick, you appear a young
tfellow of birth and fortune; let me
twhisper in your ear that you have
tfallen into very bad hands -- it's a
tregular gang of swindlers; and a
tgentleman of your rank and quality
tshould never be seen in such
tcompany.  The captain has been a
tgentleman's gentleman, and his lady
tof no higher rank.  Go home, pack
tyour valise, pay the little trifle
tyou owe me, mount your mare, and
tride back again to your parents --

Roderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him
down the street.

<b>INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Roderick enters.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tInto a pretty nest of villains,
tindeed, was I plunged!  When I
treturned to my bed-chamber, a few
thours later, it seemed as if all my

Valise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's
keys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife.

<b>tttCAPTAIN O'REILLY
</b>tWhom have I been harboring in my

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tRepeat the words again, and I run
tyou through the body.

<b>tttCAPTAIN O'REILLY
</b>tTut, tut!  I can play at fencing as
twell as you, Mr. Roderick James.
tAh!  You change color, do you?  Your

tthe O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I
tintroduce you to the nobility and
tgentry of this methropolis; I take
tyou to my tradesmen, who give you
tcredit.  I accept your note for near
ttwo hundred pounds, and what do I
tfind?  A fraud.

He holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the
linen.

<b>tttCAPTAIN O'REILLY
</b>tNot Master O'Higgins of Watertown,
tbut Roderick James of the devil only
tknows where...

Captain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver
toilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tHark ye, Mr. O'Reilly, I will tell
tyou why I was obliged to alter my
tname, which is James and the best
tname in Ireland.  I changed it, sir,
tbecause, on the day before I came to
tDublin, I killed a man in deadly
tcombat -- an Englishman, sir, and a
tCaptain in His Majesty's service;
tand if you offer to let or hinder me
tin the slightest way, the same arm
twhich destroyed him is ready to
tpunish you.

So saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and
giving a "ha, ha!" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it
within an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and
turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings
herself between them.

<b>tttMRS. O'REILLY
</b>tDearest Roderick -- be pacified.
tO'Reilly, you don't want the poor
tchild's blood.  Let him escape -- in
tHeaven's name, let him go.

<b>tttCAPTAIN O'REILLY
</b>tt   (sulkily)
tHe may go hang for me, and he's
tbetter be off quickly, for I shall
tgo to the magistrate if I see him
tagain.

O'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins
to cry.

<b>EXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY
</b>
Roderick riding down the street, with his valise.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tWhere was now a home for the
tdescendant of the James?  I was
texpelled from Dublin by a
tpersecution occasioned, I must
tconfess, by my own imprudence.  I
thad no time to wait and choose.  No
tplace of refuge to fly to.

<b>INT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tThere was a score of recruiting
tparties in the town beating up for
tmen to join our gallant armies in
tAmerica and Germany.

Roderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly
make him welcome.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI will tell you frankly, sir.  I am
ta young gentleman in difficulties; I
thave killed an officer in a duel,
tand I am anxious to get out of the
tcountry.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tBut I needn't have troubled myself
twith any explanations; King George
twas in too much want of men to heed
tfrom whence they came -- and a
tfellow of my inches was always
twelcome.  Indeed, I could not have
tchosen my time better.  A transport
twas lying at Dunleary, waiting for a
twind.

<b>EXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY
</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI never had a taste for any thing
tbut genteel company, and hate all
tdescriptions of low life.  Hence my
taccount of the society in which I at
tpresent found myself must of
tnecessity be short.  The
treminiscences of the horrid black-
thole of a place in which we soldiers
twere confined, of the wretched
tcreatures with whom I was now forced
tto keep company, of the plowmen,
tpoachers, pickpockets, who had taken
trefuge from poverty, or the law, as,
tin truth, I had done myself, is
tenough to make me ashamed even now.

Roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid
bacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess.
When it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is
served, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing
somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water.  The
beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning
round to the messman and saying:

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tFellow, get me a glass!

At which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of
laughter, the very loudest among them being Mr. Toole, a
red-haired monster of a man.

<b>tttMR. TOOLE
</b>tGet the gentleman a towel for his
thands, and serve him a basin of
tturtle-soup.

Roars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on
the deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly
seizes Roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst
of another burst of applause.

<b>tttLINK-BOY
</b>tt   (whispers)
tIf you want to vex him, ask him
tabout his wife, the washerwoman, who
tbates him.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tIs it a towel of your wife's
twashing, Mr. Toole?  I'm told she
twiped your face often with one.

<b>tttLINK-BOY
</b>tt   (whispers)
tAsk him why he wouldn't see her
tyesterday, when she came to the
tship.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAnd so I put to him some other
tfoolish jokes about soapsuds, hen-
tpecking, and flat-irons, which set
tthe man into a fury, and succeeded
tin raising a quarrel between us.

Roderick and Toole fight with cudgels.  Roderick gives him
a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the
floor.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tThis victory over the cock of the
tvile dunghill obtained me respect
tamong the wretches among whom I
tformed part.

</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tOur passage was very favorable, and
tin two days we landed at Cuxhaven,
tand before I had been a month in the
tElectorate, I was transported into a
ttall and proper young soldier, and,
thaving a natural aptitude for
tmilitary exercise, was soon as
taccomplished at the drill as the

Various cuts.

of arms, bayonet, marching.

<b>EXT.  MILITARY COURTYARD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

The Cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new
regiment, arrived from England.

Roderick sees, marching at the head of his company, his
old friend, Captain Grogan, who gives him a wink.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tSix weeks after we arrived in
tCuxhaven, we were reinforced by

tme, for it assured me that a friend
twas near me.

<b>INT.  GROGAN'S QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
Roderick and Grogan.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tGrogan gave me a wink of
trecognition, but offered no public
ttoken of acquaintance and it was not
tuntil two days afterwards that he
tcalled me into his quarters, and
tthen, shaking hands with me
tcordially, gave me news which I
twanted, of my family.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tI had news of you in Dublin.  Faith,
tyou've begun early, like your
tfather's son, but I think you could
tnot do better than as you have done.
tBut why did you not write home to
tyour poor mother?  She has sent
thalf-a-dozen letters to you in
tDublin.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI suppose she addressed them to me
tin my real name, by which I never
tthought to ask for them at the post
toffice.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tWe must write to her today, and you
tcan tell her that you are safe and
tmarried to "Brown Bess."

Roderick sighs when Grogan says the word "married," on
which Grogan says with a laugh:

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tI see you are thinking of a certain
tyoung lady at Duganstown.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tIs Miss Dugan well?

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tThere's only six Miss Dugans now...
tpoor Dorothy.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tGood heavens!  Whatever?  Has she
tdied of grief?

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tShe took on so at your going away
tthat she was obliged to console
therself with a husband.  She is now
tMrs. John Best.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tMrs. John Best!  Was there another
tMr. John Best?!

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tNo, the very same one, my boy.  He
trecovered from his wound.  The ball
tyou hit him with was not likely to
thurt him.  It was only made of tow.
tDo you think the Dugans would let
tyou kill fifteen hundred a-year out
tof the family?  The plan of the duel
twas all arranged in order to get you
tout of the way, for the cowardly
tEnglishman could never be brought to
tmarry from fear of you.  But hit him
tyou certainly did, Roderick, and
twith a fine thick plugget of tow,
tand the fellow was so frightened
tthat he was an hour in coming to.
tWe told your mother the story
tafterwards, and a pretty scene she
tmade.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tThe coward!

<b>tttCAPTAIN GROGAN
</b>tHe has paid off your uncle's
tmortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach-
tand-six.  That coward of a fellow
thas been making of your uncle's
tfamily.  Faith, the business was
twell done.  Your cousins, Michael
tand Harry, never let him out of
ttheir sight, though he was for
tdeserting to England, until the
tmarriage was completed, and the
thappy couple off on their road to
tDublin.  Are you in want of cash, my
tboy?  You may draw upon me, for I got
ta couple of hundred out of Master

</b>tOur regiment, which was quartered
tabout Stade and Luneberg, speedily
thad got orders to march southwards
ttowards the Rhine, where we would
tfight the famous battle of Minden.
tIt would require a greater
tphilosopher and historian than I am
tto explain the causes of the famous
tSeven Years' War in which Europe was
tengaged, and, indeed, its origin has
talways appeared to me to be so
tcomplicated, and the books written

In order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man
are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces,
which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the
door; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her
old, half-blinded father.

They are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but
Mr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a
couple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily
convinces the people that they have only to deal with a
person of honor.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)

tbetter than to take himself out of
tthe fire of the musketry, came
tpresently to dress the wound.

In his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved
compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking,
with no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be
billeted there.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tGo to the devil.

The private lifting his musket, hits Roderick a blow with
the butt-end of it, which sends him stunned to the ground,
allowing his comrade to take the other four guineas from
his pocket.

Recovering his senses, Roderick bleeding, with a large
wound in the head, has barely time to stagger back to the
house where he had just left the lieutenant, when he
falls fainting at the door, just as the surgeon exits.

Enter a British officer, an aide who carries a notebook,

that a sudden movement on the part of the French requires
the British army to follow them.  The town is to be

their regiments.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI began to reflect how pleasant my
tquarters were to me, and that I was
tmuch better here than crawling under
tan odious tent with a parcel of
ttipsy soldiers, or going the night-
trounds, or rising long before
tdaybreak for drill.  I determined
tthat I never would join mine again.

<b>EXT.  VIEW OUT OF WARBURG FARMHOUSE WINDOW - DAY
</b>
Roderick stands by the window, watching English troops and
wagons leaving the town.

<b>INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Roderick walks into Lakenham's room attired in his full
regimentals, and with his hat cocked over his left eye.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI'm promoted Lieutenant.  I've come
tto take my leave of you.  I intend
tto have your papers and purse.

<b>tttLAKENHAM
</b>tYou great scoundrel!  You mutinous
tdog!  What do you mean by dressing
tyourself in my regimentals?  As sure
tas my name's Lakenham, when we get
tback to the regiment, I'll have your
tsoul cut out of your body.

With this, Roderick puts his hand under his pillow, at
which Lakenham gives a scream that might have called the
whole garrison about his ears.

Roderick threatens him with a knife at his throat.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tHark ye, sir!  No more noise, or you
tare a dead man!

Roderick, taking his handkerchief, binds it tight round
his mouth, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt,
ties them in a knot together, and so leaves him, removing
the papers and the purse, and wishing him politely a good
day.

<b>EXT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - STREET - DAY
</b>
Lischen, waiting outside the house, with a saddled horse,
throws her arms around him, and makes the tenderest adieu.

Roderick mounts his newly-purchased animal, waves his hat
gallantly, and, prances away down the street.

<b>EXT.  ROAD - DAY
</b>
Roderick happily riding along a wooded country road,
rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about
two hundred yards away, a company of Prussian infantry
resting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen
mounted dragoons.

A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed
than to turn back, and he rides into their midst,
approaching a group of officers.

He presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for
directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is
riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map.

During the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches
with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and
says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if
Roderick will honor him with his company.

To avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer,
and the two men mount up, and ride off together.

</b>
Roderick and Galgenstein riding together.

Dialogue under voice over.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tMy companion treated me with great
tcivility, and asked me a thousand
tquestions about England, which I
tanswered as best I might.  But this
tbest, I am bound to say, was bad
tenough.  I knew nothing about
tEngland, and I invented a thousand
tstories which I told him; described
tthe king and the ministers to him,
tsaid the British ambassador in
tBerlin was my uncle, and promised my
tacquaintance a letter of
trecommendation to him.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tWhat is your uncle's name?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (slowly)
tO'Grady.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN

tOh, yes, of course, Ambassador
tO'Grady...

<b>EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY
</b>
Roderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads
together, jogging on.

They pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a
red-coated Hanoverian sergeant.

He exchanges signs of recognition with Captain
Galgenstein.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tIt hurts my feelings to be obliged
tto commune with such wretches, but
tthe stern necessities of war demand
tmen continually, and hence these
trecruiters whom you see market in
thuman flesh.  They get five-and-
ttwenty thaler a man from our
tgovernment for every man they bring
tin.  For fine men -- for men like
tyou.
tt   (he adds laughing)
tThey would go as high as hundred.

<b>EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
Roderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely-
looking place.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tThis is a very good inn.  Shall we
tstop for dinner?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tThis may be a very good inn for
tGermany, but it would not pass in
told Ireland.  Corbach is only a
tleague off, let us push on for
tCorbach.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tDo you want to see the loveliest
twoman in Europe?

Roderick smiles.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tAh!  You sly rogue, I see that will
tinfluence you.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tThe place seems more a farm than an
tinn-yard.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tThe people are great farmers, as
twell as inn-keepers.

They enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and
at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place.

A couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their
horses are littered under a shed hard by.

Lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of
sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their
hats to the captain.

The inn has something foreboding about it, and the men
shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tt   (explaining the gate)
tParties of French horsemen are about
tthe country, and one cannot take too
tmany precautions against such
tvillains.

The two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain
orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his
bedroom.

Roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his
pains.

They enter into supper.

<b>INT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
A dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous
old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely
creature which had been expected; and the captain,
laughing, says:

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tWell, our meal is a frugal one, but
ta soldier has many a time a worse.

Taking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great
ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his
weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the
captain's is laid.

The hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine,
at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a
considerable ill-humor.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (when she leaves)
tWhere's the beauty you promised me?

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tt   (laughing and looking
tt    hard at Roderick)
tIt was my joke.  I was tired, and
tdid not care to go farther.  There's
tnot prettier woman here than that.
tIf she won't suit your fancy, my
tfriend, then you must wait awhile.

This increases Roderick's ill-humor.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (sternly)
tUpon my word, sir, I think you have
tacted very coolly.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tI have acted as I think fit.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tSir, I'm a British officer.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tIt's a lie!  You're a deserter!
tYou're an impostor, sir; Your lies
tand folly have confirmed this to me.
tYou pretend to carry dispatches to a
tgeneral who has been dead these ten
tmonths; you have an uncle who is an
tambassador and whose name you don't
tknow.  Will you join and take the
tbounty, sir, or will you be given
tup?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tNeither!

Springing at him like a tiger.

But, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard.
He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off,
and says, from the other end of the table where he stands
dodging Roderick, as it were.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tAdvance a step, and I send this
tbullet into your brains!

The door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed
with musket and bayonet to aid their captain.

The game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which
he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the
wine, had removed his sword.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI volunteer.

<b>EXT.  A ROAD - DAY
</b>
Prussian troops on the march.  Roderick is now one of
them.

Captain Galgenstein rides by.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAt the close of the Seven Years' War,
tthe Prussian army, so renowned for
tits disciplined valor, was
tofficered and under-officered by
tnative Prussians, it is true, but
twas composed for the most part of
tmen hired or stolen, like myself,
tfrom almost every nation in Europe.
tThe deserting to and fro was
tprodigious.

</b>

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tThe life the private soldier led was
ta frightful one to any but the men
tof iron courage and endurance.  The
tpunishment was incessant.

<b>EXT.  VARIOUS RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY
</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI was not near so unhappy, in spite
tof all, as I had been on my first
tenlisting in Ireland.  At least,
tthere will be no one of my
tacquaintance who will witness my
tshame, and that is the point which I
thave always cared for most.

Rape, pillage and burn.

Brief thematic repeat of British army version.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI reasoned with myself thus:  "Now
tyou are caught, there is no use in
trepining -- make the best of your
tsituation, and get all the pleasure
tyou can out of it.  There are a
tthousand opportunities of plunder,
toffered to the soldier in war time,
tout of which he can get both
tpleasure and profit; make use of
tthese, and be happy."

<b>EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - FRAGMENT
</b>
Prussians against Austrians, or French, or Saxons.

Roderick fighting.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI do not intend to make a history of
tbattles in the Prussian any more
tthan in the English service.  I did
tmy duty in them as well as another,
tand there was not a braver,
tcleverer, handsomer, and, I must
town, wickeder soldier in the
tPrussian army.

<b>EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ACTION - DAY
</b>
<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI had formed myself to the condition
tof the proper fighting beast; on a
tday of action, I was savage and
thappy.

Roderick saves Captain Galgenstein's life.

<b>EXT.  FIELD - DAY
</b>
Roderick is decorated by Colonel Bulow for his heroism in
saving Captain Galgenstein.

Colonel Bulow gives Roderick two Frederic d'or in front of
the regiment.

<b>tttCOLONEL BULOW
</b>tYou are a gallant soldier, and have
tevidently come of good stock; but
tyou are idle, dissolute, and
tunprincipled; you have done a deal
tof harm to the men; and, for all
tyour talents and bravery, I am sure
tyou will come to no good.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken
tregarding my character.  I have
tfallen into bad company, it is true;
tbut I have only done as other
tsoldiers have done; and, above all,
tI have never had a kind friend and
tprotector before, to whom I might
tshow that I was worthy of better
tthings.  The Colonel may say I am a
truined lad, and send me to the
tdevil; but be sure of this, I would
tgo to the devil to serve the
tregiment.

Captain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's
performance.

<b>BERLIN - 1763
</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tSoon after the war ended, our
tregiment was garrisoned in the
tcapital, the least dull, perhaps, of
tall the towns of Prussia; but that
tdoes not say much for its gaiety.

<b>INT.  ANTE-ROOM - CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Roderick enters and approaches the Captain's sergeant.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tPrivate Roderick James.  First
tHanoverian Guards.  Captain
tGalgenstein sent for me.

<b>tttPRUSSIAN SERGEANT
</b>tYou may wait.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tThank you, sir.

Roderick stands stiffly.  We can make out the sound of
loud talking behind the closed door.

Enter a private huffing and puffing.

<b>tttPRIVATE
</b>tSergeant, the wagon has arrived with
tthe Captain's furniture, but the
tdriver says he is not supposed to
tunload it.  Is it possible for you
tto talk to him?

Exit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the
office, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what
is being said.

<b>tttMINISTER GALGENSTEIN (O.S.)
</b>tGive him his discharge!  Bon Dieu!
tYou are a model of probity!  You'll
tnever succeed to my place, my dear

tare just now.  Make the fellow as
tuseful to you as you please.  You
tsay he has a good manner and a frank
tcountenance, that he can lie with
tassurance, and fight, you say, on a
tpinch.  The scoundrel does not want
tfor good qualities.  As long as you
thave the regiment in terrorem over
thim, you can do as you like with
thim.  Once let him loose, and the lad
tis likely to give you the slip.
tKeep on promising him; promise to
tmake him a general, if you like.
tWhat the deuce do I care?  There are
tspies enough to be had in this town
twithout him.

Roderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to
the door.

Then the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out,
sees Roderick, smiles and say:

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tGood morning, Private James.  Please
tcome in.  I should like you to meet
tmy uncle, Herr Minister of Police
tGalgenstein.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tHow do you do, sir?

The Minister nods.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tThe captain was the nephew and heir
tof the Minister of Police, Herr
tGalgenstein, a relationship which,
tno doubt, aided in the younger
tgentlemen's promotion.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tYour loyalty to me and your service
tto the regiment has pleased me very
twell -- and now there is another
toccasion on which you may make
tyourself useful to us; if you
tsucceed, depend on it, your reward
twill be your discharge from the
tarmy, and a bounty of 100 guineas.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tWhat is the service, sir?

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tThere is lately come to Berlin a
tgentleman in the service of the
tEmpress Queen, who calls himself the
tChevalier de Belle Fast, and wears
tthe red riband and star of the
tpope's order of the Spur.  He is
tmade for good society, polished,
tobliging, a libertine, without
tprejudices, fond of women, of good
tfood, of high play, prudent and
tdiscreet.

The Captain smiles at Roderick.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tHe speaks Italian and French
tindifferently; but we have some
treason to fancy this Monsieur de
tBelle Fast is a native of your
tcountry of Ireland, and that he has
tcome here as a spy.

The Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tNaturally, your knowledge of English
tmakes you an ideal choice to go into
this service.  Of course, you will
tnot know a word of English; and if
tthe Chevalier asks as to the
tparticularity of your accent, say
tyou are Hungarian.  The servant who
tcame with him will be turned away
ttoday, and the person to whom he has
tapplied for a faithful fellow will
trecommend you.

Roderick nods.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tYou are a Hungarian; you served in
tthe army, and left on account of
tweakness in the loins.  He gambles a
tgreat deal, and wins.  Do you know
tthe cards well?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tOnly a very little, as soldiers do.

<b>tttCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
</b>tI had thought you more expert.  You
tmust find out if the Chevalier
tcheats.  He sees the English and
tAustrian envoys continually, and the
tyoung men of either ministry sup
trepeatedly at his house.  Find out
twhat they talk of, for how much each
tplays, especially if any of them
tplay on parole.  If you are able to,
tread his private letters, though
tabout those which go to the post,
tyou need not trouble yourself -- we
tlook at them there.  But never see
thim write a note without finding out
tto whom it goes, and by what channel
tor messenger.  He sleeps with the
tkeys of his dispatch-box with a
tstring around his neck -- twenty
tfrederics, if you get an impression
tof the keys.

<b>tttMINISTER GALGENSTEIN
</b>tDoes this assignment interest you?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tYes, Minister, I am interested in
tany work in which I can be of
tservice to Captain Galgenstein.

The Minister studies Roderick, coldly.

<b>EXT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, now dressed in civilian clothes, admires a
beautiful carriage, waiting at the door.  Then he enters.

</b>
<b>tttCHEVALIER
</b>tYou are the young man who M. de
tSeebach recommended?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tYes, sir.  Here is my letter.

Roderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman,
with which the Captain had taken care to provide him.

As the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the
leisure to examine him.

He is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly,
wearing rings, diamonds and laces.

One of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears
a little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios,
which fall over his lip.

The Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read
the letter.

<b>tttCHEVALIER

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tYes, sir.

<b>tttCHEVALIER

<b>tttCHEVALIER
</b>tFor whom else have you worked?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tNo one, sir.  Before that I served

tweakness of the loins.

<b>tttCHEVALIER
</b>tWho else can give me information
tabout you?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tOnly the agency of servants.

The Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for
a few seconds, and then smiles.

<b>tttCHEVALIER
</b>tYou will do.  I will give you 30...
ta day.  I do not provide your
tclothing; you will sleep at home,
tand you will be at my orders every
tmorning at seven o'clock.

He notices Roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar.

<b>tttCHEVALIER
</b>tIs there something wrong?

He goes up to Roderick.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tIt was very imprudent of me; but
twhen I saw the splendor of his
tappearance, the nobleness of his
tmanner, I felt it impossible to keep

The Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder.

</b>tt   (as he speaks,

tmy story would possible bear.

Dialogue comes up from under voice over.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tHe goes to church regularly -- he is
tvery religious, and after hearing
tmass comes home to breakfast.  Then
the takes an airing in his chariot
ttill dinner, which is served at
tnoon.  After dinner, he writes his
tletters, if he has any letters to
twrite; but he has very little to do
tin this way.  His letters are to the
tAustrian envoy, with whom he
tcorresponds, but who does not
tacknowledge him; and being written
tin English, or course, I look over
this shoulder.  He generally writes
tfor money.  He makes his party with
tCalsabigi, the lottery contractor,
tthe Russian attaches, two from the
tEnglish embassy, my lords Deuceace
tand Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer,
tand a few more.  He wins often, but
tnot always.  Lord Deuceace is a very
tfine player.  The Chevalier Elliott,
tthe English Minister, sometimes
tcomes, on which occasion the
tsecretaries do not play.

<b>INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT
</b>
The Chevalier is at play against several gentlemen,
including the Prince of Turbingen, while Roderick signals
the cards.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tIt was agreed that I should keep my
tcharacter of valet, that in the
tpresence of strangers I should not
tknow a word of English, that I
tshould keep good lookout on the
ttrumps when I was serving the
tchampagne and punch about; and,
thaving a remarkably fine eyesight,
tand a great natural aptitude, I was
tspeedily able to give my dear
tbenefactor much assistance against
this opponents at the green table.

Several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice
over.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tSimplicity was our secret.
tEverything successful is simple.
tIf, for instance, I wiped the dust
toff a chair with my napkin, it was
tto show that the enemy was strong in
tdiamonds; if I pushed it, he had an
tace, king; if I said, "Punch or
twine, my lord?" hearts was meant.
tIf "Wine or punch?" clubs.  If I
tblew my nose, it was to indicate
tthat there was another confederate
temployed by the adversary; and then,
tI warrant you, some pretty trials of
tskill would take place.  The Prince
tof Turbingen, although so young, had
ta very great skill and cleverness
twith the cards in every way; and it
twas only from hearing Ritter von
tBrandenburg, who came with him, yawn
tthree times when the Chevalier had
tthe ace of trumps, that I knew we
twere Greek to Greek, as it were.

The Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down
his cards.  He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier.

Roderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian
officer, Lieutenant Dascher.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tIt was my unrivaled skill with
tsword and pistol, and readiness to
tuse them, that maintained the
treputation of the firm.

Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is
losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker
tells him so to his face.

Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game,
takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in
his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's
adjurations, or to Roderick's.

Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard
cue and swings it at Dascher's face.

He wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and
runs at Roderick, who is unarmed.

The marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the
waist and prevents murder.

<b>tttDASCHER
</b>tI see that you are without your
tsword, but I believe you are a man
tof mettle.  Will you give me
tsatisfaction?

<b>tttRODERICK

<b>tttANOTHER OFFICER
</b>tI will undertake to pay you the 20
tlouis, but only tomorrow morning at
tthe meeting.

<b>EXT.  FIELD - DAY
</b>
On the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher,
and his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket
and hands them to Roderick, saying:

<b>tttDASCHER
</b>tI may have been mistaken, but I mean
tto make you pay deadly for your
tbrutality.

Roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the
utmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (privately)
tIt is distasteful to kill a

tI risk nothing, for I am certain to
tkill him.

<b>tttCHEVALIER
</b>tCertain?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tPerfectly certain, because I shall
tmake him tremble.

He takes his station between two trees, about four paces
apart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tYou have only to pace yourself at
tten paces difference, and fire
tfirst.  The space between these two
ttrees is the place where I choose to
twalk back and forth.  You may walk
ttoo, if you wish, when it is my turn
tto fire.

No one could have explained his intentions more clearly or
spoken more calmly.

<b>tttDASCHER
</b>tBut we must decide who is to have
tthe first shot.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tThere is no need of that.  I never
tfire first; and, in any case, you
thave that right.

Dascher places himself at the specified distance.

Roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees
without looking at him.

Dascher takes aim and fires, missing.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (with the greatest
tt    composure)
tYou missed me, sir.  I was sure you
twould.  Try again.

The others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of
discussion between the parties, but not a bit of it.

Dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again
missing Roderick.

Without a word, but in a firm and confident manner,
Roderick fires his first shot into the air.

Dascher looks amazed.  Then, aiming at Dascher with his
second pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead
and stretches him out dead on the ground.

They meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses,
carrying a master and a servant.

The driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's
driver to make way for him.

Roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset
his master in the ditch, but the other insists.

Roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and
asks him to order his driver to make way for him.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI am posting, monsieur, and
tfurthermore I am a foreigner.

<b>tttSTRANGER
</b>tMonsieur, here in Saxony, the post
thas no special right, and if you are
ta foreigner, you must admit that you
thave no greater claim than mine,
tsince I am in my own country.

At that, Roderick gets out and holding his drawn-sword
tells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him.

The stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword
and that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly
reason.

He tells Roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes
way for him.

<b>INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Roderick and the Chevalier running a faro bank when an
important lady suffers a huge loss.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tThe ladies were passionately fond of
tplay, and hence would often arise no
tsmall trouble to us; for the truth
tmost be told, that the ladies loved
tto play, but not to pay.  The point
tof honor is not understood by the
tcharming sex; and it was with the
tgreatest difficulty that we could
tkeep them from the table, could get
ttheir money if they lost or, if they
tpaid, prevent them from using the
tmost furious and extraordinary means
tof revenge.

<b>EXT.  ROAD - DAWN
</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tOn this evening, the lady of high
trank, after I had won a considerable
tsum in diamonds and pearls from her,
tsent her lover with a band of cut-
tthroats to waylay me.

Roderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their
carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon
which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.

The Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in
his right arm, which he thinks is broken.

Their servant forces the door open to help them out,
telling them that the two postilions have fled.

Roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door,
which is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move
because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.

His piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the
strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.

From the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols,
and sword.

Roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for
armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.

The Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning
and in no condition to resist robbers.

Roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune
and his life at the highest price.

His carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the
horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a
circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons.

In this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the
poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a
seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when
a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her
empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing
to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,
and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the
strength to hold in.

The chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an
attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's
lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.

Some falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his
pistol.

The leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.
During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless
Chevalier and two of them are killed.

After they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who
utters some appropriate last words, then dies.

His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at
the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,
each with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten
or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready
to obey his orders.

<b>EXT.  SPA - HOTEL - DAY
</b>
Roderick's carriage arrives.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tAfter making suitable arrangements
tfor the Chevalier's burial, in
tproper accord with his church, I
ttraveled to Spa, which was now in
tseason, alone, to continue my
tprofession which formerly had the
tsupport of my friend and mentor.

<b>INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Crowds surround Roderick.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI was by this time one of the best-
tknown characters in Europe; and the
tfame of my exploits, my duels, my
tcourage at play, would bring crowds
tround me in any public society where
tI appeared.

<b>INT.  CASINO - NIGHT
</b>
Attractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tThe passion for play is stronger
tthan the passion for gallantry; the

tstop to consider the merits of a
twoman, nor the courage to make
tsacrifices for her.

<b>EXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY

The Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir
William Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are
accompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two
servants.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tIn evoking the recollections of
tthese days, I have nothing but
tpleasure.  I would if I could say as
tmuch of a lady who will henceforth
tplay a considerable part in the
tdrama of my life -- I mean the
tCountess of Cosgrove, whose fatal
tacquaintance I made at Spa, very
tsoon after the tragic events which
tcaused me to quit Germany.

twas more than indifferent, and whom
this mother never saw.

<b>INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Shots of Sir William Cosgrove being wheeled in, and at
play with Roderick, and some other gentlemen.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI made Sir William Cosgrove's
tacquaintance as usual at the play-
ttable.  One could not but admire the
tspirit and gallantry with which he
tpursued his favorite pastime; for,
tthough worn out with gout and a
tmyriad of diseases, a cripple
twheeled about in a chair, and
tsuffering pangs of agony, yet you
twould see him every morning, and
tevery evening at his post behind the
tdelightful green cloth.

<b>tttSIR WILLIAM
</b>tHang it, Mr. Roderick James, you
thave no more manners than a barber,
tand I think my black footman has
tbeen better educated than you; but
tyou are a young fellow of
toriginality and pluck, and I like
tyou, sir.  because you seem
tdetermined to go to the devil by a
tway of your own.

Laughter at the table.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI am obliged to observe, Sir William
tCosgrove, that since you are bound
tfor the next world much sooner than
tI am, I will depend on you to get
tcomfortable quarters arranged for
tme.

Laughter.

<b>tttSIR WILLIAM
</b>tIndeed, you are right, sir.  Look at
tme.  Marriage has added forty years
tto my life.  I am dying, a worn-out
tcripple, at the age of fifty.  When
tI took off Lady Cosgrove, there was
tno man of my years who looked so
tyoung as myself.  Fool that I was!
tI had enough with my pensions,
tperfect freedom, the best society in
tEurope -- and I gave up all these,
tand married and was miserable.  Take
ta warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and
tstick to the trumps.  Do anything,
tbut marry.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tWould you have me spend my life all
talone?

<b>tttSIR WILLIAM
</b>tIn truth, sir, yes, but, if you must
tmarry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (laughing)
tThe milkmaid's daughter?

<b>tttSIR WILLIAM
</b>tWell, why not a milkmaid's daughter?
tNo man of sense need restrict
thimself or deny himself a single
tamusement for his wife's sake; on
tthe contrary, if he selects the
tanimal properly, he will choose such
ta one as shall be no bar to his
tpleasure, but a comfort in his hours
tof annoyance.  For instance, I have
tgot the gout; who tends me?  A hired
tvalet who robs me whenever he has
tthe power.  My wife never comes near
tme.  What friend have I?  None in
tthe wide world.  Men of the world,
tas you and I are, don't make
tfriends, and we are fools for our
tpains.

Polite laughter at the table.

<b>tttSIR WILLIAM
</b>tMy lady is a weak woman, but she is
tmy mistress.  She is a fool, but she
thas got the better of one of the
tbest heads in Christendom.  She is
tenormously rich, but somehow I have
tnever been so poor, as since I
tmarried her.  I thought to better
tmyself, and she has made me
tmiserable and killed me, and she
twill do as much for my successor
twhen I'm gone.

There is a reflective silence at the table.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tHas her ladyship a very large
tincome?

This question causes Sir William to burst out into a
yelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes
Roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.

<b>EXT.  ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - SPA - NIGHT

A beautiful scene, lit by the flambeaux, held by a dozen
footmen.  A small orchestra, playing in a Temple of Love,
some dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of
trees.

Roderick approaches the Countess.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tDespite my friend's strong warning.
tI resolves to become acquainted with
this lady.  Sir William Cosgrove was
tdying.  His widow would be a rich
tprize.  Why should I not win her,
tand, with her, the means of making
tin the world that figure which my
tgenius and inclination desired?
tWhen I determine, I look upon the
tthing as done.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tCharming lady, tell me the truth and

The countess laughs.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tNo.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tHave you had one?

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tNever.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tBut, for a time... a passing fancy?

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tNot even that.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tHow can I believe that there is not

tyou?

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tNot one.

<b>tttRODERICK

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tThat man has, perhaps, not yet been
tborn.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tWhat!  You have not met a man worthy
tof your attention?

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tMany worthy of attention; but
tvaluing is something more.  I could
tvalue only someone whom I loved.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tThen you have never loved?  Your
theart is empty.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tYour word "empty" makes me laugh.
tIs it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If
tit is fortunate, I congratulate
tmyself.  If it is unfortunate, I do
tnot care, for I am not aware of it.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tIt is nonetheless a misfortune, and
tyou will know it when you love.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tBut if, when I love, I am unhappy, I
twill know that my empty heart was my
tgood fortune.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tThat is true, but it seems to me
timpossible that you should be
tunhappy in love.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tIt is only too possible.  Love
trequires a mutual harmony which is
tdifficult, and it is even more
tdifficult to make it last.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI agree; but God put us on earth to
ttake that risk.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tA man may need to do that, and find
tit amusing; but a girl is bound by
tother laws.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI believe you, and I see I must

tshall become the unhappiest of men.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tHow so?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tBy loving you, with no hope of
tpossessing you.

She laughs.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tYou want my heart?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tIt is my only object.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tTo make me wretched in two weeks.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tTo love you until death.  To
tsubscribe to all your commands.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tThe amusing thing is that you
tdeceive me without knowing, if it is
ttrue that you love me.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tDeceiving someone without knowing it
tis something new for me.  If I do
tnot know it, I am innocent.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tBut you deceive me nonetheless if I
tbelieve you, for it will not be in

Roderick laughs and kisses her.

</b>tBe so good as to tell me with whom
tyou think you are?

</b>tWith a woman who is completely
tcharming, be she a princess or a

twho, regardless of her rank, will
tshow me some kindness, tonight.

She laughs.

</b>tAnd if she does not choose to show
tyou some kindness?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tThen I will respectfully take leave
tof her.

<b>tttCOUNTESS

<b>tttRODERICK

</b>tAlways, my dear one, never any

tcan only kill it.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI know better than you do.  Love
twants a more substantial fare, and
tif it is stubbornly withheld, it
twithers away.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tOur abstinence makes our love
timmortal.  If I loved you a quarter

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tSir William Cosgrove is a man who is
tdying, and yet I envy him more than

tprivilege of which I am deprived.
tHe may take you in his arms whenever

She silences him with her fingertips.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tShall I tell you something -- I
tbelieved what was called love came
tafter the union -- and I was
tsurprised when my husband, making me
ta woman, made me know it only by
tpain, unaccompanied by any pleasure.
tI saw that my imaginings had stood
tme in better stead.  And so we
tbecame only friends, seldom sleeping
ttogether and arousing no curiosity
tin each other, yet on good terms for
ta while, as whenever he wanted me, I
twas at his service, but since the
toffering was not seasoned with love,
the found it tasteless, and seldom

Sir William makes the most courtly of bows and grins, and

of illness permits, and her ladyship and Roderick reply to

Sir William Cosgrove greets this line with a yell of
laughter.  His laugh is not jovial or agreeable, but
rather painful and sardonic, and ends in a violent fit of
coughing.

<b>tttSIR WILLIAM
</b>tGentlemen, see this amiable youth!

<b>tttRODERICK

tbe sworn to muster just as much

tan accomplished performer, she
twould, as often as not, begin to

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tShe was luckily very fond of her
tyoungest son, and through him I had
ta wholesome and effectual hold on

</b>tAnother day, it was Patrick's
tbirthday, we were giving a grand
tball and gala at Hackton, and it was
ttime for my Patrick to make his
tappearance among us.

There is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes
in, led by his half-brother, who walks into the dancing-
room in his stockinged feet, leading little Patrick by the
hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older.

<b>tttBROOKSIDE
</b>tt   (very loudly)
tDon't you think he fits my shoes
tvery well, Sir Richard Wargrave?

Upon which, the company begins to look at each other and
to titter, and his mother comes up to Lord Brookside with
great dignity, seizes the child to her breast, and says:

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tFrom the manner in which I love this
tchild, my lord, you ought to know
thow I would have loved his elder
tbrother, had he proved worthy of any
tmother's affection.

Brookside is stunned by his mother's words.

<b>tttBROOKSIDE
</b>tMadam, I have borne as long as
tmortal could endure the ill-
ttreatment of the insolent Irish
tupstart, whom you have taken into
tyour bed.  It is not only the
tlowness of his birth, and the
tgeneral brutality of his manners
twhich disgusts me, but the shameful
tnature of his conduct towards your
tladyship, his brutal and
tungentlemanlike behavior, his open
tinfidelity, his habits of
textravagance, intoxication, his
tshameless robberies and swindling of
tmy property and yours.  It is these
tinsults to you which shock and annoy
tme more than the ruffian's infamous
tconduct to myself.  I would have
tstood by your ladyship, as I
tpromised, but you seem to have taken
tlatterly your husband's part; and,
tas I cannot personally chastise this
tlow-bred ruffian, who, to our shame
tbe it spoken, is the husband of my
tmother, and as I cannot bear to
twitness his treatment of you, and
tloathe his horrible society as if it
twere the plague, I am determined to
tquit my native country, at least
tduring his detested life, or during
tmy own.

Bursting into tears, Lady Cosgrove leaves the room.
Roderick loses control, and rushes at Brookside, knocking
down Lords, Dukes and Generals, left and right, who try to
interfere.

The company is scandalizes by the entire incident.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tMy reception at court was scarcely

thad news of Lord Brookside.  On
twhich I replied, with no ordinary
tpresence of mind:

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tSire, my Lord Brookside has set sail
tto fight the rebels against Your
tMajesty's crown in America.  Does
tYour Majesty desire that I should
tsend another company to aid him?

The King stares at Roderick, turns on his heel and quickly
leaves the presence-chamber.

Roderick is approached by the Duke of Rutland, who takes
him aside into an alcove.

<b>tttDUKE OF RUTLAND
</b>tt   (speaking very
tt    quietly)
tLet me tell you, sir, that your
tconduct has been very odiously
trepresented to the King, and has
tformed the subject of royal comment.
tThe King has said, influenced by
tthese representations, that you are
tthe most disreputable man in the
tthree kingdoms, and a dishonor to
tyour name and country.

Roderick begins to sputter.

<b>tttDUKE OF RUTLAND
</b>tHear me out, please.  It has been
tintimated to His Majesty that you
thad raised the American Company for
tthe sole purpose of getting the
tyoung Viscount to command it, and so
tget rid of him.  And, further, that
tyou had paid the very man in the
tcompany, who was ordered to dispatch
thim in the first general action.

</b>tThus it is that my loyalty is
trewarded, and my sacrifices in favor
tof my country viewed!

<b>tttDUKE OF RUTLAND
</b>tAs for your ambitious hopes
tregarding the Irish peerages, His
tMajesty has also let it be known
tthat you have been led astray by
tthat Lord Crabs, who likes to take
tmoney, but who has no more influence
tto get a coronet than to procure a
tPope's tiara.  And, if you have it
tin mind to call upon Lord Crabs, you
twill be disappointed.  He left for
tthe continent on Tuesday, and may be
taway for several months.

tme, to point out my services to the
tgovernment, and to ask when the
treward, that had been promised me,
tthe title held by my ancestors, is
tagain to be revived in my person.

There is a sleepy coolness in the fat Lord West.  He hears
Roderick with half-shut eyes.  When he finishes his
violent speech, which he has made striding about the room,
Lord West opens one eye, smiles, and says:   

<b>tttLORD WEST
</b>tt   (gently)
tHave you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tYes!

<b>tttLORD WEST
</b>tWell, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you
tpoint by point.  The King is
texceedingly averse to make peers, as
tyou know.  Your claim, as you call
tthem, have been laid before him, and
tHis Majesty's gracious reply was,
tthat you were the most impudent man
tin his dominions, and merited a
thalter, rather than a coronet.  As
tfor withdrawing your support from
tus, you are perfectly welcome to
tcarry yourself whithersoever you
tplease.  And, now, as I have a great
tdeal of occupation, perhaps you will
tdo me the favor to retire, or tell
tme if there is anything else in the

So saying, Lord West raises his hand lazily to the bell,
and bows Roderick out.

door that some of them carry, little Patrick.  He lies in
his little boots and spurs, and his little coat of scarlet
and gold.  His face is quite white, and he smiles as he

</b>
Arrival of Mr. Newcombe, the money-broker.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI had hired a money-broker
tespecially to find some means of my
tmaking a loan.  After several months
twithout success, it was with some
tconsiderable interest that I
treceived his visit.

<b>INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY
</b>
Roderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.

<b>tttNEWCOMBE
</b>tI have good news for you, Mr.
tCosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle
tand Chatwick, in the city of London,
tare prepared to lend you 20,000
tpounds, pledged against your
tinterest in the Edric mines.  They
twill redeem the encumbrances against
tthe property, which amount to some
t10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-
tyear working lease on the mines.
tThey will lend you the 20,000 pounds
tagainst the lease income,
twhich they will apply to the loan as
tit comes in, and they will make a
tcharge of 18% per annum interest on
tthe outstanding loan balance.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tMr. Newcombe, I have made some
tdifficult loans during the past few
tyears, at very onerous terms, but
t18% a year interest seems very stiff
tindeed.

<b>tttNEWCOMBE
</b>tConsidering your financial
tcircumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has
tbeen impossible to find anyone at
tall prepared to do any business with
tyou.  I think you may count yourself
tlucky to have this opportunity.
tBut, obviously, if you would reject
tthis offer, I shall keep trying to
tfind a better one.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tt   (after a pause)
tI am prepared to accept the terms,
tMr. Newcombe.

<b>tttNEWCOMBE
</b>tThere are a few other points we
tshould discuss.  The loan agreement
tcan only be executed by her
tladyship's signature, and provided
tthat Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
tassured of her ladyship's freewill
tin giving her signature.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tProvided that they can be assured of
ther ladyship's freewill?  Are you
tserious?

<b>tttNEWCOMBE
</b>tMay I be quite frank with you?

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tYes, of course.

<b>tttNEWCOMBE
</b>tMister Bracegirdle said to me that
the had heard her ladyship lives in
tsome fear of her life, and meditated
ta separation, in which case, she
tmight later repudiate any documents
tsigned by herself while in durance,
tand subject them, at any rate, to a
tdoubtful and expensive litigation.
tThey were quite insistent on this
tpoint, and said they must have
tabsolute assurance of her ladyship's
tperfect freewill in the transaction
tbefore they would advance a shilling
tof their capital.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tI see.

<b>tttNEWCOMBE
</b>tWhen I asked them in what form they
twould accept her ladyship's
tassurances, they said that they were
tonly prepared to accept them if her
tladyship confirms her written
tconsent by word of mouth, in their
tpresence, at their counting-house in
tBirchin Lane, London.  I requested
tthey come here, and save her
tladyship and yourself the
tinconvenience of the trip to London,
tbut they declined, saying that they
tdid not wish to incur the risk of a
tvisit to Castle Hackton to
tnegotiate, as they were aware of how
tother respectable parties, such as
tMessrs. Sharp and Salomon had been
ttreated here.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tDepend on it, there is some
tartifice.  When once you get into
tthat wicked town, you are not safe.
tThere are scores of writs out
tagainst you for debt.  If you are
ttaken in London, and thrown into
tprison, your case is hopeless.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tMother dear, we are now living off
tour own beef and mutton.  We have to
twatch Lady Cosgrove within and the
tbailiffs without.  There are certain
tsituations in which people cannot
tdictate their own terms; and faith,
twe are so pressed now for money,
tthat I would sign a bond with old
tNick himself, if he would provide a
tgood round sum.  With this money, we
tcan settle our principal debts and
tmake a fresh start.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tRoderick, you must listen to me.  As
tsoon as they have you in London,
tthey will get the better of my poor
tinnocent lad; and the first thing
tthat I shall hear of you will be
tthat you are in trouble.  You will
tbe a victim of your own generous and
tconfiding nature.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tWhy go, Roderick?  I am happy here,

tyou now are.  We can't appear in
tLondon as we ought; the little money

tthe rest has been.  Let us stay here

She takes his hand and kisses it.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tWe did not start in state, you may
tbe sure.  We did not let the country
tknow we were going, or leave notice
tof adieu with our neighbors.  The
tfamous Mr. James Cosgrove and his
tnoble wife traveled in a hack-
tchaise and pair.

The Countess lays her head on Roderick's shoulder and
smiles.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tWhen a man is going to the devil,
thow easy and pleasant a journey it
tis!  The thought of the money quite
tput me in a good humor, and my wife,
tas she lay on my shoulder in the

tit was the happiest ride she had
ttaken since our marriage.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tMy lady and I agreed that, with the
tmoney, we would go to France, and
twait there for better times, and
tthat night, over our supper, formed
ta score of plans both for pleasure

Roderick and his wife making love.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tO woman!  Woman!  When I recollect
tLady Cosgrove's smiles and
tblandishments, how happy she seemed
tto be on that night!  What an air of
tinnocent confidence appeared in her
tbehavior, and what affectionate
tnames she called me!  I am lost in
twonder at the depth of her
thypocrisy.  Who can be surprised
tthat an unsuspecting person like
tmyself should have been a victim to
tsuch a consummate deceiver?

The coach drives up.

<b>INT.  STAIRCASE - DAY
</b>
Roderick and the Countess looking for the office.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI easily found out Mr. Tapewell's
tapartment:  a gloomy den it was, and
tin an unlucky hour, I entered it.

They climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and
the dim sky of a dismal London afternoon.

The Countess seems agitated and faint.

When they get to the door, she stops in front of it.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tRoderick -- don't go in.  I am sure
tthere is danger.  There's time yet,
tlet us go back -- anywhere!

The Countess has put herself before the door in a
theatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand.

He pushes her away to one side.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tLady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tOld fool!

She jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a
moldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tSay Lady Cosgrove is here!

She stalks down the passage, muttering:  "Old Fool."

<b>INT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Tapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his
parchments and tin boxes.

He advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and
points towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes,
rather wondering at the lawyer's insolence.

The lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back
in a moment.

In the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another
layer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons
and pistols, and Lord Brookside.

Lady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son,
crying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her
preserver, her gallant knight.

Then, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of
invective which quite astonishes him.

<b>tttCOUNTESS
</b>tOh fool as I am, I have outwitted
tthe most crafty and treacherous
tmonster under the sun.  Yes, I was a
tfool when I married you, and gave up
tother and nobler hearts for your
tsake -- yes, I was a fool when I
tforgot my name and lineage to unite
tmyself with a base-born adventurer
t-- a fool to bear, without repining,
tthe most monstrous tyranny that ever
twoman suffered; to allow my property
tto be squandered; to see women as
tbase and low-born as yourself...

<b>tttTAPEWELL
</b>tFor heaven's sake, be calm.

Tapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a
threatening look in Roderick's eye.

The Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury,
screaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and
always beginning and ending the sentence with the word
"fool."

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tYou didn't tell all, my lady -- I
tsaid "old" fool.

<b>tttBROOKSIDE
</b>tI have no doubt that you said and
tdid, sir, everything that a
tblackguard could say or do.  This
tlady is now safe under the
tprotection of her relations and the
tlaw, and need fear your infamous
tpersecutions no longer.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tBut you are not safe, and as sure as
tI am a man of honor, I will have
tyour heart's blood.

<b>tttTAPEWELL
</b>tTake down his words, constables;
tswear the peace against him.

<b>tttBROOKSIDE
</b>tI would not sully my sword with the
tblood of such a ruffian.  If the
tscoundrel remains in London another
tday, he will be seized as a common
tswindler.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tWhere's the man who will seize me?

He draws his sword, placing his back to the door.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tLet the scoundrel come!  You -- you
tcowardly braggart, come first, if
tyou have the soul of a man!

The Countess and the bailiffs move away.

<b>tttTAPEWELL
</b>tWe are not going to seize you!  My
tdear sir, we don't wish to seize
tyou; we will give you a handsome sum
tto leave the country, only leave her
tladyship in peace.

<b>tttBROOKSIDE
</b>tAnd the country will be rid of such
ta villain.

As Brookside says this, he backs into the next room.

The lawyer follows him, leaving Roderick alone in the
company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.

<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI was no longer the man I was at
ttwenty, when I should have charged
tthe ruffians, sword in hand, and
tsent at least one of them to his
taccount.  I was broken in spirit,
tregularly caught in the toils,
tutterly baffled and beaten by that
twoman.  Was she relenting at the
tdoor, when she paused and begged me
tto turn back?  Had she not a
tlingering love for me still?  Her
tconduct showed it, as I came to
treflect on it.  It was my only
tchance now left in the world, so I
tput down my sword upon the lawyers
tdesk.

Roderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tGentlemen, I shall have no violence;
tyou may tell Mr. Tapewell I am quite
tready to speak with him when he is
tat leisure.

Roderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably.

</b>
<b>tttRODERICK (V.O.)
</b>tI was instructed to take a lodging
tfor the night in a coffee house near
tGray's Inn, and anxiously expected a
tvisit from Mr. Tapewell.

Tapewell talking to Roderick.

<b>tttTAPEWELL
</b>tI have been authorized by Lady
tCosgrove and her advisors to pay you
tan annuity of 300 pounds a year,
tspecifically on the condition of you
tremaining abroad out of the three
tkingdoms, and to be stopped on the
tinstant of your return.  I advise
tyou to accept it without delay for
tyou know, as well as I do, that your
tstay in London will infallibly
tplunge you in gaol, as there are
tinnumerable writs taken out against
tyou here and in the west of England,
tand that your credit is so blown
tupon that you could not hope to
traise a shilling.  I will leave you
tthe night to consider this proposal,
tbut if you refuse, the family will
tproceed against you in London, and
thave you arrested.  If you accede, a
tquarter salary will be paid to you
tat any foreign port you should
tprefer.

<b>tttRODERICK
</b>tMr. Tapewell, I do not require a
tnight to consider this proposal.
tWhat other choice has a poor, lonely
tand broken-hearted man?  I shall
ttake the annuity, and leave the
tcountry.

<b>tttMR. TAPEWELL
</b>tI am very glad to hear that you have
tcome to this decision, Mr. Cosgrove.
tI think you are very wise.

There is a knock at the door and Roderick opens it.
Brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols.

The dialogue for this scene has to be written.

Brookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to
have Roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out
against him for debt.

Mr. Tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that
Brookside is acting in bad faith.

Brookside brushes aside his objections.

Roderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair.

The following lines are read over Roderick being shackled
and led out of the room.
