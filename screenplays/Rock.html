<b>BEGIN MAIN 'TITLE SEQUENCE:
</b>
An impressionistic montage:

A SILHOUETTED MAN in front of mirror dons his Marine dress blues.  Spit
polish shoes laced.  Medals clipped to jacket.  All in CLOSE-UP.  We
never see him fully.

The Man puts HIS HAT squarely on his head.  EYES glint.

On the man's dresser: MARINE MEMORABILIA.  Three Purple Hearts, photos
of a WOMAN (his wife), PHOTOS OF MARINES in combat locales.  TIGHTER
into the photos, we HEAR PANICKED VOICES, EXPLOSIONS, NOISES OF BRUTAL
<b>COMBAT.
</b>


IMAGES: Through smoke, a desperate MARINE PRIVATE who knows he will
never be rescued... TWO MARINES walk up to a farmhouse door; through the
screen we see a MOTHER AND DAUGHTER who know what the news will be...



IMAGES: A MARINE COLOUR GUARD carries a COFFIN...  Now we are the coffin
as a FLAG drapes down on us. placed into a YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND.

Now we're in ARLINGTON CEMETERY.  Images of the cemetery are reflected
in wet puddles, as the SPIT-SHINED SHOES walk past images of the TOMB OF
THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER a ROW OF GRAVES comes into focus



A1G CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S HAT, and his EYES.  Suddenly AN EXPLOSION
and we see --

A MARINE in a jungle, radioing for help: ,You gotta get us outta here
sir, Jesus, they're all over us... ! And an' EXPLOSION ends the
communication ...



AII  CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S EYES and FADE IN:

<b>EXT.  ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - MORNING
</b>
Two groundskeepers on "ride 'em" lawn mowers, BENNIE and MARLIN, smoke
Camels and watch the MARINE OFFICER from the opening montage.  He's
alone, across the cemetery.



<b>ttttttBENNIE 
</b>ttYou'll get used to him.  Every Sunday morning - rain, snow,
ttholidays nothin, keeps him Away.



<b>ACROSS THE CEMETERY
</b>
Brig.  Gen.  FRANCIS XAVIER HUMMEL stands before a headstone: BARBARA
<b>MCLEAN HUMMEL 1946-1996.
</b>


<b>ttttttHUMMEL
</b>ttHi Barb.  The house sold yesterday.  I know, I know, the market's
ttdepressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area.  Some things I have to
ttdo.  Things I couldn't do while you were here.  Maybe you would have
ttapproved.  Hell, I know you wouldn't have. (beat) I've tried everything
ttand I can't seem to get their attention.  But now they'll learn how it
ttfeels on the other side.  Let's hope it elevates their thinking.



Hummel puts new flowers on the grave.  Walks off.

<b>EXT.  ACCESS ROAD TO ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Heavy rain.  A road next to a heavily guarded bunker facility.  A canvas
covered ARMY TRUCK blows a tire in the road.  The DRIVER gets out. 
Inspects the tire.



<b>INT.  ARMY TRUCK - NIGHT
</b>
FOUR MARINES in black suits dive through a hole in the truckbed floor
into a MANHOLE IN THE ROAD.



<b>EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT
</b>
Three ARMY M.P.s at the front GUARDHOUSE.  GENERAL HUMMEL pulls up in a
SUBURBAN.  The M.P.s immediately recognise him and stand more rigidly.



<b>tttttARMY M. P. 
</b>ttGeneral Hummel, sir.  It's an honour. Is the Colonel
ttexpecting you, sir?



<b>tttttHUMMEL
</b>ttHeld better be.  This is a security inspection.



<b>tttttARMY M. P.
</b>ttYes, sir!

The M.P. waves Hummel in, saluting crisply.

<b>INT.  GRATED STORM DRAIN IN BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
The four marines from the truck are waiting, readying arms.  The leader
is looking at his watch.  Gives a hand signal to the others, and up they
go --



<b>EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
The four marines emerge from the storm drain and move toward covered
positions in the compound.



200 YARDS AWAY - TWO ARMY "MAGAZINE CHECKERS" emerge from a building
with clipboards, on routine check.


<b>INT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
The Army M.P.s escort General Hummel inside.  THREE ARMY GUARDS spring
up from their SURVEILLANCE MONITORS.  Everyone's nervous, in awe, rigid
at attention.  COLONEL CALLAHAN emerges from an adjacent room,
sleepy-eyed.



<b>tttttCOLONEL CALLAHAN 
</b>ttGeneral Hummel!  This is a surprise!



<b>ttttHUMMEL 
</b>ttThat's the idea, Colonel.



<b>EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - WATCH TOWER - NIGHT
</b>
Two marines position themselves outside the door to the bunker
compound's elevated watch tower.



<b>x85EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Below the watch tower, the ARMY MAGAZINE CHECKERS approach.  Marines 1
and 2 spring out, armed with M-16s with over/under grenade launchers
They shoot BEAN BAG projectiles at the Army Guards, who collapse, dazed.



<b>INT.  BUNKER COMPOUND WATCH TOWER - NIGHT
</b>
Marines 3 and 4 burst inside the watch tower.  The guards inside spring
up.  BOOM BOOM, they're hit by bean bag projectiles, propelling them out
the windows of the watch tower.  They fall 10 feet and lie unconscious.



<b>EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT
</b>
Marines 1 and 2, now in MAGAZINE CHECYERIS UNIFORMS, move to the BUNKER
DOOR.  They open the door with the Magazine checker's CODED CARDS.



<b>INT.  CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - NIGHT
</b>
Two ARMY GUARDS, playing poker, look up at the entering marines. 
Marines 1 and 2 walk straight up to the Army Guards, holding them at bay
with M-16s.  Before any words are spoken, one of the marines injects
each of the guards with a VACCINE PISTOL.



<b>INT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Four more marines led by SGT.  CRISP enter, holding Col. Callahan,
General Hummel and the Army Guards at bay.



<b>tttttSGT.  CRISP
</b>ttThis is a security exercise, sir. We've fully breached and
ttinfiltrated your compound.  I'm afraid you and your men are my
ttprisoners, sir.

The marines begin cuffing the Army Guards to the radiator and taping
their mouths.



<b>tttttSGT.  CRISP 
</b>ttSorry sir, you realise the importance of these exercises.



<b>ttttttHUMMEL 
</b>ttttt(to Callahan) 
ttTen men who could have been terrorists are out there
ttdoing whatever they damn well please to your compound, Colonel.  Here
ttyou sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator.  This is not a
tttight ship.  I would not want to be in your shoes in the morning.



Sgt.  Crisp hits the FRONT GATE'S OPEN BUZZER and follows Hummel out of
the room.



<b>EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT
</b>
The gate swings open.  TWO HUMVEES enter the compound.

<b>EXT.  CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - NIGHT
</b>
The marines use a 'rabbit tool, (hydraulic, compact and powerful) to pry
open the bunker's steel doors.  They rush down a hallway.



CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - INTERIOR HALLWAY - The marines rush up to
another steel door and quickly pry it open.



<b>INT.  C.B.W. BUNKER - NIGHT
</b>
A refrigerated storage room for chemical weapons.  Storage tubes are
labelled: V.X. POISON GAS.  Across the room are rockets labelled: 55 115
<b>MM BOLT ROCKETS.
</b>


Using the TRACK HOOK SYSTEM in the bunker's ceiling, the marines move
the V.X. CHEM ROUNDS and BOLT ROCKETS to the waiting humvees.  It's very
fast, like clockwork.



<b>EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOLIND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT
</b>
The Humvees, followed by Hummel in his Suburban, roar out of the
compound.  CUT TQ:

</b>ttYou owe me five dollars, Marvin.



ACROSS THE ROOM - BILL GOODSPEED, 30, and partner/trainee MARVIN
ISHERWOOD, 25, feet up on desks, with toy guns.  This is Man's Boredom. 
A ceiling fan circles.  Isherwood yawns; scratches neck with his gun
barrel.



GOODSPEED reloads.  Aims.  Fires.

THE DART hits A CARDBOARD TARGET across the room which activates a Rube
Goldberg series of events ending in a PLASTIC GIRL being ignited in a
<b>PAN OF CHEMICALS.
</b>


GOODSPEED, without even getting up, casually sprays the pan with flame
retardant foam.



<b>tttttISHERWOOD
</b>ttttt (yawns) 
ttI was told this was exciting work.



<b>tttttGOODSPEED 
</b>ttPatience, Marvin.  It has its moments.



A KLAXON sounds.  Isherwood smiles excitedly.

<b>INT.  F.B.I. CHEMICAL WEAPONS - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
Isherwood follows Goodspeed down a grimy, off-white corridor illuminated
by antiseptic light.  This is an older building.  Hasn't been
refurbished and shows it.



<b>INT.  F.B.I. CHEMICAL WEAPONS - LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
A medium-sized laboratory, where 5 F.B.I. TECHNICIANS are bent over
tables of beakers, test-tubes, Bunsen burners, etc.  The room and
equipment are old and used; could be 1976 rather than 1996.



Along one side of the lab is a plexi-glass wall. Inside the plexi-glass
is an airlocked GAS CHAMBER. F.B.I chemists LONNER and LING motion to
Goodspeed.

<b>tttttDR. LONNER
</b>
ttC'mere, Billy. 
ttt(points inside gas chamber) 
ttA dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian 
ttrefugee camp.  Could be detergent, could be seran gas.



INSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - is a LARGE WOODEN CRATE next to a TABLE OF
<b>POISON DETECTION INSTRUMENTS.
</b>


<b>tttttISHERWOOD 
</b>ttBosnian refugee camp?  I don't get it.



<b>tttttGOODSPEED 
</b>ttHalf a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.  Serbians
ttdon't like Bosnians.  Read a newspaper.  It's good for you.  Hold out
ttyour hand.



Isherwood does so.  It's shaky.

<b>tttttISHERWOOD 
</b>ttI'm okay.  Really.  Let's do it-



Hold on Goodspeed's uncertain look, and CUT TO:

INT.  GAS C ER - DAY - MINUTES LATER The door HISSES open.  Goodspeed
and Isherwood, in vulcanized rubber suits and visored helmets, enter. 
They go to the INSTRUMENT TABLE before the crate.



A GLASS VESSEL with tiny air holes (like a salt shaker) descends from
the ceiling.  Inside are COCKROACHES. .



<b>ttttttGOODSPEED 
</b>ttCoal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys.



<b>ttttttDR. LING
</b> ttttt  (into mike) 
ttWe have airlock, Bill.  Proceed.



<b>ttttttGOODSPEED
</b>ttttt(into helmet mike) 
ttJuly 1, 0.900 hours, agent william
ttGoodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood.  Initiating exam of a
ttwooden crate.  Suspicion of seran gas device inside.



Goodspeed grabs a pry-bar from the instrument table-and slowly pries
open the cratels wooden lid.  He motions to Isherwood.  Together they
gingerly lift the lid.

INSIDE THE CRATE - it's filled with "UNICEF" type stuff. Goodspeed lifts
out a HOT-PLATE.  Isherwood lifts out an EGG BEATER.  Gocidspeed runs a
POISON SENSOR past each.



<b>ttttttGOODSPEED 
</b>ttAppears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and... (lifts
ttout a sweatshirt) ... old clothes.


<b>ttttttISHERWOOD 
</b>ttThis is thrilling.


Isherwood lifts out a DOLL.  Goodspeed's POISON SENSOR'S NEEDLE goes
crazy... !


<b>ttttttGOODSPEED 
</b>ttCareful, goddamn it Marvin!



The doll's eyes open.  Its mouth blast a PINKISH SPRAY, hitting
Goodspeed's forearm and Isherwood's palm.



OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - DR.  LING stabs a button marked "exhaust" and
another marked "emergency."



A KLAXON sounds.  F.B.I. TECHNICIANS race for the exit.


IN THE GAS CHAMBER - The pinkish gas hovers in the air. CEILING EXHAUST
FANS begin to suck it up.



IN THE GLASS VESSEL - The cockroaches convulse, flip in the air and
explode, guts splattering the vessel walls.



<b>ttttttISHERWOOD 
</b>ttWhat's hap...  what's happening....?



DR. LING looks at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the control panel.

<b>ttttttDR. LING 
</b>tDon't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear.  You're
tokay.



Goodspeed grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and
grabs A SCALPEL.  Cuts open the doll's chest.



<b>ttttttGOODSPEED 
</b>ttI've got some bad news and some really bad news.  The bad news
ttis the gas is corrosive.  It's eating our suits.



ISHERWOOD looks at his RUBBER GLOVES.  The rubber is beginning to bubble
and corrode.



<b>ttttttDR. LING 
</b>ttWhat's the really bad news.



GOODSPEED peels back the doll's plastic chest, revealing: a C-4
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE and TEN POISON AMPULES.

<b>ttttttGOODSPEED 
</b>ttEnough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas
ttto kill everybody in the building.



Isherwood's and Goodspeed's rubber gloves are melting.

<b>ttttttISHERWOOD 
</b>ttThe acid's eating...  it's eating my fucking suit...



<b>ttttttGOODSPEED 
</b>ttChill, Marvin. 
ttttt(yells outside) 
<b>ttWHERE'S THE GODDAMN SPRINKLERS?
</b>


Dr. Lonner flips on the sprinklers.  The pipes KNOCK.  A FEW PATHETIC
DROPS trickle from the SPRINKLER HEADS.



<b>ttttttDR. LONNER 
</b>ttSomething's blocking the pipes, Bill.  When in Christ's name
ttare they gonna give us a new building ...



<b>ttttttDR. LING 
</b>ttGet the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin.



Isherwood, terrified, jerks open an OVERHEAD CABINET, revealing several
6 inch needled SYRINGES.



<b>ttttttDR. LING 
</b>ttYou die, we all die, Bill.  Inject yourself, then diffuse it.
ttt(Goodspeed continues to inspect-the device)
ttGoddamn it, Bill, take the antidote.



Isherwood fumbles with a huge syringe.

<b>ttttttGOODSPEED 
</b>ttGet that away from me. 
tttt      (to himself)
ttI hate needles.



<b>ttttttDR. LING 
</b><b>ttINJECT YOURSELF!
</b>

<b>ttttttGOODSPEED 
</b><b>ttLONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER?
</b>

The pipes are KNOCKING, now they're COUGHING.

<b>ttttttDR. LONNER 
</b>ttIt's coming, it's coming ...


ISHERWOOD sinks to his knees, holding the huge syringe in front of his
heart, hari-kari style, hands trembling ...

GOODSPEED concentrates on the device; his calm is unsettling.  His hands
flash, grabbing instruments and performing precise, deft, functions.  He
snips a wire and splices it.  Another.  Another.



<b>ttttttDR.  LING 
</b>tttttt(sweating it out)
tTen seconds, Bill.



Isherwood moves the syringe closer to his chest.

<b>ttttttISHERWOOD 
</b>ttOh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY
<b>ttIT'S REAL.
</b>


ISHERWOOD drops the syringe.  Fumbles for another... GOODSPEED,
ice-cold, continues on the device ...



<b>ttttttDR. LING 
</b>ttFive seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus Christ ...



GOODSPEEDIS RUBBER GLOVE is stretched to transparency. we see
GOODSPEED'S FLESH through the acid-eaten rubber.  He makes one final
cut-and-clamp.  THE DETONATOR on the poison gas turns off.



<b>ttttttDR. LING 
</b>ttThree, two...  the gas is clear!



OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - GREEN LIGRTS FLASR on the control panel and A
TORRENTIAL SPRAY soaks GOODSPEED AND ISRERWOOD.  Isherwood is wide-eyed
and trembling.  Goodspeed glares at him.



<b>ttttttDR. LING tttt
</b>ttNext time use the atropine!



<b>ttttttGOODSPEED
</b>ttI don't like needles.

The tourists are now panicked, confused, and making a commotion. 
Shouting and yelling.  A woman is crying.

Suddenly a .45 is fired.  Total silence.  Hummel and Baxter, followed by
Pvts.  Gamble and Starling (pulling a gurney stacked with MARINE FIELD
RATIONS), walk to the middle of the cell block.

tt"gunfighter."



<b>tttttF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>ttWhat was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam? 
ttAnybody read it?


<b>tttttRAYDEN SINCLAIR 
</b>ttNo.  Give me the skinny.


<b>tttttGENERAL KRAMER 
</b>ttThe "skinny," Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have
tteither won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting
ttAmerican lives.  I happen to share General Hummells view.



The door opens.  A NAVAL ATTACHE pokes his head in.

ttCan you help us out?


INTERCUT - PENTAGON and ALCATRAZ as necessary.

<b>tttttHUMMEL 
</b>ttI'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three
ttForce Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands. 
ttForty-seven in northern Laos and southern China ...


<b>tttttHAYDEN SINCLAIR 
</b>ttSouthern China?  We never admitted we sent troops into

</b>ttWell White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday
ttI had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed
ttthat many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat,

Sinclair's irritation is relieved by the Naval Attache, entering again,
who hands him a phone and whispers:

Sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking
sotto voice.


<b>tttttGENERAL KRAMER 
</b>ttContinue Frank.

<b>tttttHUMMEL 
</b>ttEighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and
ttEl Salvador.  Remember the Gulf War.  Those pretty "smart bomb" pictures
tton C.N.N.? My men lased those targets.  Ten were left to rot outside
ttBaghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu,

General Kramer, embarrassed, nods yes.

<b>tttttHUMMEL 
</b>ttIf you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney

Hayden Sinclair returns to the table.

<b>tttttF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK 
</b>ttWhat did Hummel mean by ",standard countermeasure," General?

<b>tttttGENERAL PETERSON 
</b>ttNapalm.  Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm.  
ttIt burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation.  The problem is
ttthat V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm. 
ttHummel must know about Willy Peter, General.


<b>tttttGENERAL KRAMER 
</b>tt'Course he does. 
ttttt(explaining to others) 
tt"Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still 
ttin its test phase.  It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up V.X. 
ttttt(dawning on him) 
ttThat explains Hummells time frame.  He knows we're not
ttoperational.  What would it take, General?


<b>tttttGENERAL PETERSON 
</b>ttTo equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36
tthours?  An act of God. 
ttttt(off Kramer's look) 
ttAll right, we can try.  But
ttview the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.

ttThe idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison,

tttake their rocket positions without a shot fired.  But I need better
ttintelligence.


<b>tttttGENERAL KRAMER 
</b>ttYou've studied the architectural plans.

look to C.I.A. Director AMWAY.


<b>tttttGENERAL KRAMER 
</b>ttThe former warden?

</b>ttDidn't three guys escape?  I thought I saw a movie about it.


<b>tttttAGENT WOOD 
</b>ttIt's a Hollywood myth.  No one's escaped Alcatraz and lived.


F.B.I. Director trades a very significant look with C.I.A. Director

GAMBLE unclips a GRENADE.  Before he can pull the pin....

MASON FIRES HIS CLIP EMPTY at the AIR CONDITIONER MOUNT on the ceiling

</b>ttYou know how this shit works?


Darrow advances on Goodspeed.  The only route to GOODSPEED 
is between the rocket and the window.  Darrow continues advancing., GOODSPEED 
eyes the launcher's IGNITION SWITCH.  As Darrow passes between thewindow and
the launcher ....

EXT.  LOWER LIGHTHOUSE - DAY -- CAPT.  FRYE chops at the door lock with
a FIRE AXE.

scrambles up the interior metal stairs.



<b>EXT.  LOWER LIGHTHOUSE ROOFTOP - DAY
</b>
<b>GOODSPEED 
</b>emerges on the roof.  Sets down the chem round.  Pulls out the
POISON PEARL STRANDS, his hand shaking.  With the other hand, he unclips
the ROCKET GUIDANCE CHIP.



The COPPER STRANDS holding the pearls are corroded.  A strand BREAKS. 
Four PEARLS fall. GOODSPEED 
catches three.  The FOURTH drops, hitting
his SHOE.  It rolls along the rooftop. GOODSPEED 
sets aside the other
pearls and dives, grabbing the stray pearl an inch from the roof,s edge.



Suddenly THE HUGE LIGHTHOUSE WINDOW behind GOODSPEED 
EXPLODES, showering GOODSPEED with glass.



ON THE ADJACENT ROOFTOP ~ PVT.  MCCOY, wielding a smoking .60 Cal
MACHINE GUN.  McCoy fires a wicked, long, sustained burst, emptyinc his
entire ammunition belt.


THE LIGHTHOUSE SEARCHLIGHT FRESNEL blows to shreds.
GOODSPEED rolls away, GLASS SHARDS raining down on him, cutting him-.  
He's a sitting duck.



MCCOY casts aside the .60 Cal and unshoulders a SNIPER RIFLE.  Draws a
bead on GOODSPEED 
again.  GOODSPEED, bleeding, terrified, cowers,
awaiting death.


A SILHOUETTE APPEARES behind McCoy.  It's MASON, dirty and bloodied. 
McCoy spins.  MASON  
bats the rifle aside, KNEES McCoy in the solar
plexus, grips McCoyls NECK -- SNAP! -and HURLS him off the roof.  McCoy
falls 5 floors.



GOODSPEED gives MASON a thankful glance.  And hears THE DOOR BURST OPEN
<b>BELOW.

FRYE barges onto the roof.  Sees the DISMANTLED CHEM ROUND.  Goodspeed's
at the edge of the roof looking down.

sprints after Goodspeed. INT.  MAIN CELL HOUSE - STAIRWELL - DAY Mason

Faces off with Mason.  Cox draw his knife and lunges.  MASON  
catches Cox' wrist.



Cox, with his free hand, hits Mason.  Hard.  MASON recoils.  Counter
punches.  On comes Cox.  He's huge and menacing.  He hits MASON  
again. Again.  Again.  Cox has MASON  backed up to the stairwell. -

<b>INT.  NEW INDUSTRIES BUILDING - DAY
</b>
Goodspeed, frantic, sprints across the floor, SPLASHING through puddles.
He loses his footing. falls and slides across the floor, clutching the
guidance chip an,d pear.

He gets to his feet.  LIMPS behind some RUSTY MACHINERY.

FRYE enters.  Sees RIPPLES IN PUDDLES left by Goodspeed. Frye creeps
across the floor.  Following the ripples.

<b>INT.  MAIN CELL HOUSE - STAIRWELL - DAY
</b>
Mason's nearly through.  Backed up against the railing.  Cox comes in
again.  WHAM WHAM.  MASON spits blood and teeth. MASON'S moves to
his pocket.  As Cox comes in for the death blow --



MASON  pulls the MOTOR OIL from his picket and sprays it in Cox's eyes. 
The big man is dazed, blinded.  MASON  
steps aside and rams Cox over the
railing.  Cox falls to his death on the floor below.  MASON  
looks down
at him.


<b>MASON  
</b>Snakes hate the stuff.


<b>INT.  NEW INDUSTRIES BUILDING - DAY

Frye creeps close to Goodspeed's hiding place. GOODSPEED 
lunges from
behind the machinery, jamming his fingers into Fryels mouth and ramming
home the POISON PEARL.


GOODSPEED HAMMERS his fist into Fryels JAW.  We hear the glass breaking
in Fryels mouth.  Fryels eyes widen.  GREY SMOKE SPEWS FROM HIS MOUTH
AND NOSTRILS.  His eyes bulge.


GOODSPEED tries to step away.  Frye bearhugs him, pressing his face
close.  Frye open his mouth, spewing forth a CLOUD OF POISON in
Goodspeed's face.


<b>tttCAPTAIN FRYE 
</b>ttYou're comin, with me.


GOODSPEED shoves Frye away.  Frye drops, his body quivering.  Blood
pours form his ears and nose.  Frye spasms in a sickening dance of
death.


GOODSPEED reels away,.  COUGHING.  Dizzy, he falls to his knees.  He's
gassed and knows it.  Desperately, he rips at his PANDLEG.  A SYRINGE
taped to his calf.  ATROPINE.


He pulls it free and hesitates.  A beat, then -- He PLUNGES the long
needle into his chest.  Into his heart.  Depresses the plunger.
