tPAN DOWN to reveal:

</b>
tA flat horizon, stretching to infinity.

tA 360 degree pan reveals: nothing.  Deserted, no hiding places.  No animals, no
thumans, no objects.  Except in mid distance --


<b>3tRED PHONE BOX
</b>
tbrightly painted, traditional, comforting, belongs in a village green.  Perfectly
tordinary -- except for its location.

tSilence.  Only the wind over the plain.  Except --

tThe PHONE RINGS.

tRING-RING ... a mellow, old-fashioned tone.  We wait for someone to answer it.  But
tof course nothing and nobody for miles.  Except --


<b>4tIN DISTANCE

ta CAR ENGINE ... A puff of smoke on the horizon ... VA-VA-VOOM of high geared
tacceleration, as INTO VIEW

<b>tZOOM! --
</b>

<b>5tCARt
</b>
tspeeding like a bullet.  Driven at maximum, breakneck speed, 125 mph.  A petite open
ttop '65 Lotus Elan, all streamlined curves, full throttle, it nears the phone box, and --

tSCREECHES to a halt.

tDust clears, ENGINE NOISE FADES.  From the seat, hops --


<b>6tKINKY BOOT
</b>
tin black leather.

tBuckled.  Strap at ankle.  Crunching into the ground.
<b>tPAN UP TO:
</b>

<b>7tBEAUTIFUL WOMAN
</b>
tlate 20's.  In CLOSEUPS of -- Tight black leather catsuit.  A flash of auburn hair. 
tBlack leather like a second skin.  Smoothed over legs, thighs.  Buckled at wrists, straps
tat ankles, zips --

tPulled up over flesh.  This is EMMA PEEL, scientist.  Sexual, invulnerable, cool.  Very
tcool.  She locks up at clouds in the sky.  Then steps across to the phone box.  Picks up
tthe phone.

<b>tttttEMMA
</b>tttHow now brown cow ...

</b>tttt(filtered)
tttPassword affirmative. Thank you,
tttDoctor.

tEmma puts down receiver.  Hangs a cardboard outside the phone box.  Then presses
tbutton bakelite box.

tA second's wait.  A coin from the slot.  Then a HUM as --


<b>8tINSIDE PHONE BOX
</b>
tthe floor lowers automatically.  Emma disappears.  Hanging outside the box, a notice
tnow reads "Out of Order."

tNext to the call box we notice a sign: an arrow pointing into the desert:  "London 84
tmiles."


<b>9tINT.  LABORATORY
</b>
tunderground.  Emma descends on the lift platform; steps into a research lab in retro hi
ttech.  Walks past assistants, down long pink and orange steel corridors, Werner von
tBraun goes disco.  Nears a door, marked:  "Prospero Project -- Authorized Personnel
tOnly." Logo with lightning emerging from a cloud.


<b>10      FROM AIRLOCK DOOR
</b>
tA man enters, older.  In matching leather suit: like an astronaut.  Early 40's, handsome,
tcharismatic, with swept-back silver-black hair.  His name tag: DR. PETER PEEL.

<b>tttttPETER
</b>tttReady, darling?

tPeter fixes her name tag: DR. EMMA PEEL; runs a finger down over her breast.  She
tsmiles.

<b>tttttEMMA
</b>tttReady as I'll ever be ...

tMutual erotic, intellectual attraction.  Peter takes her hand and they walk down:


<b>11      LONG CORRIDOR
</b>
tair-lock doors: a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech Labyrinth --

tA man joins them.  A shyer, bespectacled, less handsome version of Peter.  On his name
ttag: DR. VALENTINE PEEL -- brother and partner.

tIn b.g., a countdown starts, ECHOING thru the lab

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttAtmospheric pressure checked, antenna ready... 
tttThermal chamber ready ... Compression module 
tttset ... Temperature control on course between 
tttone and one forty ... Water turbulence steady ...

<b>tttttPETER
</b>tttAnything else?

tValentine smiles, shrugs --

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttGood luck ... Peter ... Emma.

<b>tttttEMMA
</b>tttThanks, Valentine ...

tEmma gives him a quick peck on the cheek.

tA shy look from Valentine at Emma.  Peter senses

<b>tttttPETER
</b>tttJust a minute, darling. My brother's a 
tttworry wart. I better have a word ...
tttValentine --

tPeter takes Valentine over to one side.  Emma checks gauges and dials.  Behind her a
tconversation.  Peter returns.

tHe takes a ring from his finger --


<b>12      CLOSEUP - DIAMOND GEM
</b>
ton a gold ring.


<b>13      BACK TO SCENE
</b>
tHe slips it onto her finger.

<b>tttttPETER
</b>tttSomething to remember me by.

tPeter smiles.  The remark strikes Emma as curious.  But no time to query.  She smiles
tback.  He gives her a kiss --

<b>tttttPETER
</b>tttt(checks his watch)
tttSee you in an hour ...

<b>tttttEMMA
</b>tttOne sunny day ...

tThe countdown ECHOES around them as they separate.


<b>14      IN DISTANCE
</b>
tValentine watches her.


<b>15      INT.  LAB CHAMBER
</b>
tInside a bed of ice, Emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel radioactive
tthermal chamber, glowing eerily blue

tThe effect is very cold.  Frozen.  Numb.  Like a sci-fi Sleeping Beauty, beauty
tentombed and sealed in a glass coffin.  Plunged down into a vault.  Opposite her --

tIn another glass coffin, Peter Peel, is lowered down.


<b>16      FROM EMMA'S POV
</b>
tThe sound of their HEARTBEATS.  Their BREATHING.  BLEEP and PULSE OF
tELECTRONICS.  Thru glass and leather.  Like cerebral sex.  Technological, erotic.
tPeter winks at her -- Emma locks longingly at him, as --


<b>17      UP IN CONTROL ROOM
</b>
tValentine watches behind glass.  Like a kid excluded from a bedroom.  He attends to
tdials.  And to his female assistant --

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttt(thrilled)
tttReadings still normal ...

tThe assistant smiles oddly.  FOCUS ON --

tAn insignia tattooed on her neck: "X404."  A replicant.
tThey monitor screens.  A DULL HUM.


<b>18      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY
</b>
tA weather antenna emerges from the ground:  an enigmatic phallic silver blob, like a
tKoons sculpture.  The sun glints off it ...


<b>19      DOWN BELOW
</b>
tA temperature gauge rises.

tThe ice is infused with pulsating colors: purple -- blue -- green -- red.  Starts to heat
up     as if --

tIt soaks up temperature:  from cold to hot in instants.


<b>20      CLOSEUP - WHITE GLOVED HAND ON DIAL
</b>
t"CUMULUS COLLECTOR." The graphs accelerate, but over the dull HUM -- a
tMURMUR, a BREATH.  As Emma's HEARTBEAT rises

tThe gloved  hand turns up the dial, past a red danger mark.

tSuddenly a BLIP.  Something wrong.


<b>21      DOWN IN HIS VAULT
</b>
tPeter Peel's "coffin" starts to overheat. Peter reacts --

<b>tttttPETER

tttLosing control -- malfunction
tttin thermal chamber -- for Christ's
ttt-- Emm --!


<b>22      IN CONTROL ROOM
</b>
tNeedles push off the dials, as --

tThe ice swells: strange mix of colors, absorbing heat and energy in clusters of molten
tmetal ... steam and sparks ignite ... Valentine's eyes widen in alarm ...

tThe emergency light goes on -- the ALARM sounds -- lab assistants running ...


<b>24      IN HER COFFIN
</b>
tEmma realizes; looks to Peter --


<b>25      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY
</b>
tThe "Koons" antenna is drawing a strange purple cloud towards it, from otherwise blue
tsky ... siphoning the purple atmosphere down itself into


<b>26      INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
tThru the air ducts the purple cloud starts to billow ... Panic stations! Valentine looks
taghast at the graphs:  all systems fucked, over the intercom --

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttEmma, Peter, get out! It's going to explode!

tFROM Valentine's anguished face TO Emma's face, as

<b>tttttVALENTINE

<b>27      FROM HER VAULT
</b>
tEmma undoes the straps, clambers out of her pod


<b>28      ANGLE (IN DREAMLIKE SLOW MOTION)
</b>
tEmma clambers onto her husband's pod -- in a sequence eternally replayed for her as a
tnightmare --


<b>29      BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttGet out! Leave him -- ! Emma!


<b>30      RAPID INTERCUTS
</b>
tThe purple smoke enveloping Peter'stpod, soft caresses -- Peter struggling within,
tlooking at Emma --

<b>tttttEMMA
</b>tttPeter!

tHer leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin.  Her HEARTBEAT sounds ... She
tgrabs, claws on glass --

tHer fist draws back, blam! blam! blam! three deadly blows, Emma SMASHES the pod
tcover, it --

tCracks -- splinters -- not breaking -- obscuring his face inside like a spider's web, as
tbehind her

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttDon't wait for him -- he's not --

tBreathless, blood smeared on glass, Emma's gashed fist bleeds thru torn leather glove --
ttwisted mass of flesh and glass -- GROWLING sound growing as:

</b>
tThe voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna...!


<b>32      CLOSEUP ON EMMA'S DIAMOND RING

tttEmma ... Emma ...

tAs a GROWLING sound grows till

tBOOM!  An EXPLOSION rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and vision
tseparate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche.  A trauma.


<b>34      ANGLE (IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION)t
</b>
tThe blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a dream, floating
tbackwards in --

tA milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of control,
tweightless, powerless, as --

tThe background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish. A spinning, black void
topens up behind her, as her eyes shut, head falls back --

tAn orgasmic, dream of near-death, as a CRASH OF MUSIC BEGINS a hip new
tversion of the "AVENGERS" THEME TUNE --

<b>tCREDITS SEQUENCE.
</b>

<b>35      SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
tIn stark silhouette  The swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space
<b>t
</b>tAn umbrella tossed in the air, flicked like a deadly weapon --

tA rich velvety feel, key colors black/white/red.  Dandyish and erotic followed by blasts
tof violence, dreamy op-art puzzles and psychedelic patterns over --

tA sensuous BLACK, background -- slowly revealed to be a woman's leather-clad 
tbody --

tIn silhouette -- A bowler hatted man, Steed, a catsuited woman Emma.  Flashes of: 
thair -- eye -- a red rose -- in bloom -- petals folding and unfolding, then tightly shut.

tA thorned stem, sharp to the touch --

tFROM black and white INTO color -- leather Background metamorphosing into black
tand white of a chessboard as ...

tA medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance --

tA fetishistic attention to detail: leather catsuit, swish of legs, boots ... hair tossed
tback - - red nails over black ... creamy white skin ... zips ...

tA silhouetted man in bowler hat in Savile Row suit -- old Etonian knotted tie --
tumbrella stabs like a sword --

tUmbrella with knotted stems of a rose furling round -- then a tear, gash -- rose cut and
ttossed into --

tHis lapel. Until, at the end: together in silhouette.
tBowler hat thrown, skimming, swishing thru air, until --

tNow only a single HEARTBEAT ... BA-BOOM ... BA-BOOM ...
tThen --

tPISTOL SHOTS OVER as:


<b>36      INT.  EMMA'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN
</b>
tA gasp as Emma wakes abruptly from her nightmare, years later, startled by the shots,
tnaked beneath satin sheets.  Her HEARTBEAT FADES as she looks around her Klaus
tOldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets.  A toss of her hair.

tLooks more mature. Sexual, haunted. Mrs. Emma Peel -- widow.

tSame every night.  Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead husband, Peter Peel.
tFrom outside ANOTHER SHOT ...

tEmma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees --


<b>37      HER POV
</b>
ta CAR zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early morning streets.  The
tdamn thing BACKFIRES again ...

</b>
tZoom!  The sleek, sporty black Jaguar SS100 burns down deserted streets.  Inside is a
tbowler-hatted man --

tJOHN STEED, late 30's.  Handsome English gent, roguish looks, dandy's clothes.  A
tBeau Brummel figure in a Savile Row suit, velvet collar, embroidered waistcoat.
tA debonair Etonian, Steed oozes charm, wit and - when he chooses to -- hard-edged,
tsteely menace.  He drives through --

<b>40      LONDON (1999)
</b>
tThis is 'Avengersland': a parallel world painted by Rene Magritte, forever England.
tBright pinks, greens and reds, an imperial city in final decadent bloom.  White stucco
tbuildings. Regency style in candy colors.  A surreally 90's city like a hipper, edgier
tversion of the 60's preserved in aspic, where --

tOver the RADIO, a plummy voice:

<b>tttttANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>tttt(filtered)
ttt... The War Office today approved military 
tttexpenditure for the nation's new defense alert 
tttsystem. A spokesman  said he would raise the 
tttmatter at the forthcoming World  Council of 
tttMinisters, but that a state of vigilance was 
tttstill necessary in the uncertain climate.

tAs Steed turns into a mews, we realize that in this kinky, pop world, ordinary life does
tnot intrude.  No traffic.  No extras.  Nothing to spoil the view.

tAs the radio continues with a weather forecast, Steed --


<b>41      EXT.  STEED'S GARAGE - DAWNt
</b>
tSteed's car enters his garage -- Door closes as --


<b>42      INT.  STEED'S FLAT - DAWN
</b>
tbut the curtains are still drawn so the place is dark.

tA large bachelor's den.  Dark wood, leather armchairs ...

tSteed enters his library from a concealed door --
tTitles on wine and birdwatching.  He clicks the door, goes to his drinks cabinet. Pours
ta brandy.  Hears a noise ...

tInstantly on guard.  In his glass, sees a shadowy reflection move.  Steed peers 'round a
tcorner.  Sees a silhouetted figure stand over his desk -- a burglar?
tSteed sneaks up behind -- raises his umbrella, and --

tCrack!  Brings the umbrella down -- on the suspect's head.  Who manages to dodge,
tswivel 'round, and --

tBam!  Delivers an expert blow to Steed's stomach.  A rapid exchange of blows.  Steed
trecoils, about to jab the umbrella, when --

tHis assailant about to deliver a kick to his crotch -- Steed covers the area -- bam! a
tspiked heel hits his bowler -- as the curtains are drawn back, light floods in -- they
tfreeze.

tSteed knows his opponent:  a lethal blonde in red leather.

tSteed swivels 'round to face -- upside down -- a man hanging like a bat from the ceiling
tinches before him --

tPommaded hair, fat, dandyish:  MOTHER, head of secret services; hands of extendable
tmetal hooks.  And BRENDA, his beautiful leather-clad bodyguard.  Who smiles
tseductively.

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttMother. I thought you were burglars.

<b>tttttMOTHER
</b>tttBrenda and I thought we'd drop in.

tMother suits action to the word, drops into his wheelchair.

<b>tttttBRENDA
</b>tttSee how you're getting on ...

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttSomething in the wind?

tMother wheels himself from the study.  Taps a barometer.  It whirls around.

</b>
tA groovy penthouse (a Lichtenstein come to life?).  Bach PIANO MUSIC floats in the
tair.

tHands gliding over keys, Emma Peel plays with virtuoso skill.  On the piano, a framed
tpicture of her late husband.  And a photo of Emma between Peter and Valentine.

tA KNOCK.  Emma gets up, goes to the door.  The MUSIC KEEPS PLAYING, keys
tjumping up and down automatically, as --


<b>46      AT DOOR

tEmma flicks open a large automated eye.  Peers thru.  Opens

ttt'Please answer the Telephone.'

tEmma looks: The phone sits there.

tJust then ... RING-RING.  Emma goes over, picks up the phone.  A recorded message,

</b>tttReally -- what happened in 1922?

tBored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall.  Old mahogany, portraits of dead
tpoliticians, leather chairs.  A male enclave.

tThe Porter rushes up to restrain her.

tHardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds the nerve ends. 
tThe Porter winces and --

<b>tttttEMMA
</b>tttThank you so much. I can find Mr.
tttSteed myself ...

t-- collapses on the ground in agony.  Emma ignores him.  Pushes thru double doors,
tupstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her, into

</b>
tThru a cloud of steam in an oriental room

tSteed sits naked save for a towel.  He hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees --

tWearing racing goggles, windscreen down --

tExecutes a nifty maneuver, swerves on a zebra crossing, scatters pedestrians,
tHONKING his HORN.  Beside him, Emma is cool as a cucumber.  Steed turns

tttA word of warning. Don't take the

tSteed swerves down a narrow alleyway, into a secret car park entrance by the
triverbank.  He pulls up before a sign:

<b>tttRIVER THAMES WATER AUTHORITY
</b>tttttNo Admittance

tAt a control barrier Steed inserts a card.  Emma sees a light flash up: "Security -- Top
tPriority Clearance Only."  The barrier lifts.  She looks again at Steed, reappraising him
tas Big Ben approaches four.  The car disappears in darkness ...

tttbeen you.

tSilence.  Emma looks away, shocked.  Steed intervenes

</b>tttYou're accusing Mrs. Peel of
tttkilling her own husband?

<b>tttttMOTHER
</b>tttHer husband suspected someone very 
tttclose to the operation. On the day he 
tttdied, he was setting a test.
tttTo prove to himself -- to us that his

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttI was at Harrow ...

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttBut did they teach you this?

tValentine whacks the blade off Steed's umbrella handle.  Laughs.  A diminished phallic
tsymbol.  Steed, dumbfounded.

tValentine advances towards Steed --

tWho points the umbrella at him.

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttBang-bang ... you're dead.

</b>tttYou wish.

tHe moves to close in, when ...

</b>
tfrom the muzzle, as a BULLET ZIPS out, and --


<b>336     VALENTINE

trecoils.  Blood streams from his shoulder.  He looks up, devastated.  Steed blows
tsmoke away from the muzzle.

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttOne shot -- for emergencies.

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttt(clutches wound)
tttThat's not playing by the rules.

tttRules are made to be broken.

</b>tttt(pulls his own gun)
tttIf you say so.

</b>tttI do.

tHe FIRES again.  To the heart.  Valentine spins to the floor.

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttYou said ... one shot.

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttDid I? My mistake.

tSteed turns to the console, tries to figure out how to stop the countdown, when behind
tthe hatch opens again, revealing Emma.  Valentine pulls her up, grabs her as hostage --

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttI wouldn't do that, if I were you.

tSteed turns.

</b>tttMrs. Peel -- !

tValentine has Emma, a knife to her throat, stands over the hatch.

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttBullet-proof waistcoats -- just the

tttWe'll be off now, won't we, darling?

tttWe wouldn't want to miss the

tValentine drags Emma, bolting the hatch.

tA DIFFERENT ALARM BUZZER SOUNDS and the words:

tA different set of numbers start running backwards ...

tValentine, dragging Emma, reacts to the new ALARMS.

</b>tttFool ...

tIn his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move.  A struggle -- Emma takes a bad fall
tdown a landing below.  Ugly THUD.  Dead.

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttThat will do.

tHe's materialized across the girder from Valentine.  Who pulls his revolver.

</b>tttAren't you forgetting about

</b>tttYou are, and it's behind you.

tBad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace.

</b>tttLet go, you ... idiot ...

tUh uh.  She holds him in a vice-like grip.  Hugging Valentine.

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttI think she really likes you ...
tttWhere's Mrs. Peel?

<b>tttttVALENTINE
</b>tttUgh ...

tAs the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.  Cradled together, she
tchokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as --

tOne last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine
tlocked in her arms in a dying embrace.

tThey fall into the mists and liquid below.

tSteed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.  Looks down, sees ...

tDead.

</b>tttEmma!

tHe has said her name.  He scrambles down to her body.

tEmma lying sprawled out on the ground.

tSteed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty."  His eyes fill with
ttears.  He lays her down.

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttEmma ...

tHe produces Peter's ring.


<b>351     CLOSEUP - RING
</b>
tSlips it onto her finger and ...

</b>
tKisses her.  A chaste kiss on the lips.  But with the force and passion of a lover.  He
tcloses his eyes, looks away in grief.  The ALARM STILL SOUNDS but Steed doesn't
tgive a damn.

tBehind, Emma opens her eyes.  As if revived by the kiss.  Or the ring.  Looks up at
thim.

<b>tttttEMMA
</b>tttSteed?

tSteed looks back at her -- surprise, delight.

tA few weeks later.  Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled behind them,

tFrozen fur-clad Siberian peasant.  As he turns a corner, dogs stumble from ice and
tsnow into --


<b>361     SAND
</b>
tThe peasant stops, stares.


<b>362     AHEAD OF HIM
</b>
tSun beats down.  A tropical beach.  A warm sea.  A butler, Trubshaw.  POPS a
tCHAMPAGNE CORK.  From a tent, he brings two glasses down the beach to


<b>363     TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS

tWhere Steed and Emma toast in the sun.  Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma in a bikini.

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttOur chaperon.

<b>tttttEMMA
</b>tttPity your mother came, too ...

tSteed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with EMMA is spoiled.  Trubshaw
tpours glasses of champagne.

<b>tttttSTEED
</b>tttStill a little warm, Trubshaw.
tttIs this the '28? A little more

tTrubshaw trots off dutifully.  A large ice bucket appears.  Mother moves in.  Absorbed
tby Emma, now his new protegee.

<b>tttttMOTHER
</b>tttAbout your next assignment, Mrs.
tttPeel ...

<b>tttttEMMA
</b>tttNext assignment?

tSteed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant.  He presses a switch -- an umbrella
tshoots up between them, opens up, twirls.

tPULL BACK to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical weather. 
tAgainst a Siberian b.g. of snow.  As we WIDEN we REVEAL a giant glass bubble,
