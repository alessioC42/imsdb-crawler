</b>
tAs the OPENING TTTLES ROLL against a series of shots of
tstatues and paintings of former presidents, we HEAR shards of
tdialogue from various presidential speeches.


<b>tMAIN TITLES END ON
</b>

<b>tEXT. BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tIt's an early November morning, and the sun has just come
tover this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment
tbefore we

<b>                                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY
</b>
tA SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private
televator as he talks into his shirt cuff.

<b>ttttAGENT COOPER
</b>ttLiberty's moving.

tAnother AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is
tfollowed a step or two later by

<b>tPRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD.
</b>
tSHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy,
tprofessional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old.

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttThe 10:15 event's been moved inside
ttto the Indian Treaty Room.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (to Janie)
ttThe 10:15 is American Fisheries?

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttYes, sir. They're giving you a
tt200-pound halibut.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttJanie, make a note. We need to
ttschedule more events where somebody
ttgives me a really big fish.

tJANIE starts to make a note.

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttYes, sir.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttJanie, I was kidding.

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttOf course, sir.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>tt       (to the AGENT at the
tt        elevator)
ttHey, Cooper.

<b>ttttAGENT COOPER
</b>tt'Morning, Mr. President.

tSHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttMr. Rothschild asked to have a moment
ttwith you this morning.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttIs he upset about the speech last night?

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttHe seemed concerned.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttWell, it wouldn't be a Monday morning
ttunless Lewis was concerned about
ttsomething I did Sunday night.

tThe elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32,
tLEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It
twould appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night,
tthough that doesn't seem to slow him down.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttYou skipped the whole paragraph.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (to Janie)
ttAnd Monday morning it is.

tLEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the
tdouble doors leading to the South Lawn.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>tt"American can no longer afford to
ttpretend that they live in a great
ttsociety"...and then nothing. You
ttdumped the whole handguns paragraph.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttThis is a time for prudence, Lewis.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttThat was the kick-ass section.

tThe three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down
tthe COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West
tWing.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttI thought what with being the
ttPresident and all...

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttSir, of course I didn't mean to
ttimply--

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttI thought you'd be turning cartwheels
ttthis morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job
ttapproval.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttThat's great news, sir, but...

tThey walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.

<b>ttttGROUNDKEEPER
</b>tt'Morning, Mr. President.

tBefore he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting,
tJANIE quickly and quietly said--

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttCharlie.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>tt'Morning, Charlie.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttSir, the press is gonna need an
ttexplanation.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttFor what?

tSHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held
topen by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make
ttheir way through the corridors of


<b>tINT. THE WEST WING - DAY
</b>
tThey walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES
<b>tAND OFFICE WORKERS.
</b>
<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttBecause you dropped the whole kick-ass
ttsection, now we've got this thing hanging
ttout there.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttThere's a thing hanging out there?

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>tt"Americans can no longer afford to
ttpretend that they live in a great
ttsociety." Then ...nothing. No
ttexplanation. No context. So now it's
ttjust this thing.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttAnd it's hanging out there?

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttYes, sir.

tSHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttMaria--

<b>ttttSTAFFER (MARIA)
</b>ttGood morning, sir.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttDid they tell you I'm gonna need--

<b>ttttSTAFFER (MARIA)
</b>tt--overall consumer spending and not
ttjust first homes. Yes, sir. We'll have
ttit for you in 15 minutes.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttThanks.

tSHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttMr. President, I really feel we need
ttto focus on...

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttLewis, however much coffee you drink
ttin the morning, I want you to reduce it
ttby half.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttI don't drink coffee.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttThen hit yourself over the head with
tta baseball bat, would you please?

tAnother STAFFER crosses their path--

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttHappy birthday, Laura.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttHey, Laura, happy birthday.

<b>ttttSTAFFER (LAURA)
</b>ttThank you, sir.

tOnce out of earshot--

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt(to JANIE)
ttI should send her some flowers.

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttYou already did, sir.

tAnd, with that, they walk through a doorway and into


<b>tINT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tIn the OUTER OFFICE, MRS. CHAPIL, the President's secretary,
tis hard at work on a word processor. She stands as SHEPHERD
twalks in--

<b>ttttMRS. CHAPIL
</b>ttGood morning, Mr. President.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttHow're you, Mrs. Chapil?

<b>ttttMRS. CHAPIL
</b>ttFine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left
ttthe detailed breakdown of the approval
ttpoll for you. He seemed to indicate that
ttit was very good news.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttSixty-three percent of it, at any rate.

tAnd by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has
tgone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight
tbriefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used
tto doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading,
tlistening, and talking at the same time.

<b>ttttMRS. CHAPIL
</b>ttLucy called just a moment ago. You
ttforgot to sign her permission slip
ttfor her class--

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>tt--the museum trip. I'll go get it.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (to JANIE)
ttWhat time does she get home today?

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttThree-twenty.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttHow's my afternoon look?

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttVery crowded.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttSchedule some time for me at 3:30.

<b>ttttWOMAN (O.S.)
</b>ttBuenos dias, Senor Presidente.

tThis from ROBIN McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the
tPresident's press secretary, as she strides into the room.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttToo-tall McCall, how was Mexico?

<b>ttttROBIN
</b>ttI didn't truly appreciate it until I
ttcame back and discovered that America
ttisn't a great society.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttt   (to ROBIN)
ttHe dumped a whole section.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttNow there's a thing hanging out there.

<b>ttttROBIN
</b>ttNot a great society, sir?

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttWell, with you out of the country, it
ttwasn't, Robin. Now that you're back,
ttwe're great again.

<b>ttttROBIN
</b>ttThere's a press room full of people
ttsaying "What did he mean by that?"

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttSee?

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (re: a memo he's been
ttt    looking at)
ttA.J., did you get one of these?

tThis is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a
tseparate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition
tto being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor,
the's the President's closest and oldest friend.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttIs that the letter from Solomon at
ttthe GDC?

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttIt would appear to be a letter from
ttthe entire environmental community.
ttThese people are outta control.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttI think they're just frustrated,
ttMr. President.

<b>ttttROBIN
</b>ttAre they blaming the President for
ttglobal warming?

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttWell, they don't think he caused it,
ttif that's what you mean.

ttt   (continuing;
ttt    to SHEPHERD)
ttSir, I'm on the phone with these
ttpeople twice a week. I honestly
ttdon't know what they want at this
ttpoint.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttWhat they want is a 20 percent reduction in
ttfossil fuel emissions.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttIt won't pass at 20 percent.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttWe haven't really tried.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttLewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane
tthold too many markers. If we try to
ttpush this through and lose, there will
ttbe a very loud thud when we hit the
ttground, and that's not what you want in
ttan election year.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttTalk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them
ttthe President resents the implication
ttthat he's turned his back on the
ttenvironment. Tell them I'll send 455 to
ttthe floor. But we're gonna ask for a
tt10 percent reduction. If they want to pull
tttheir support, fine. At 63 percent job
ttapproval rating. I don't need their help
ttgetting a bill passed. We gotta get going--
ttwhere's Leon?

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttt   (to an AIDE)
ttWould you call Mr. Kodak and tell him
ttthe President's--

tA.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on
tpedestrian collision in the outer office--

<b>ttttMRS. CHAPIL (O.S.)
</b>ttAaagh!

<b>ttttKODAK (O.S.)
</b>ttSorry! Sorry, my fault.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttt   (to the AIDE)
ttNever mind.

tLEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House
tpollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along
twith A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's
tStarting Team. The people in this room have grown very close
tover the past few years.

<b>ttttKODAK
</b>ttExcuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttYou all right?

<b>ttttKODAK
</b>ttThey keep moving that big ficus plant.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttWe're all here, Mr. President.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttOkay. First, I wanted to say
ttcongratulations. Three years ago, we
ttwere elected to the White House by
ttone of the narrowest margins in history,
ttand today Kodak tells us 63 percent of
ttregistered voters think we're doing a
ttgood job.

<b>ttttKODAK
</b>ttWait a second. You wanted me to poll
ttregistered voters?

tEveryone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttBut the poll also tells us what we
ttalready knew: We don't get this
ttcrime bill of ours through Congress
ttand these numbers are gonna be a
ttmemory. So, starting today, we're
ttshifting it into gear.

<b>ttttROBIN
</b>ttCan I tell my morning press gaggle
ttthat gun control--

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttCrime control, Robin. Gun control
ttmeans we're wimps and we're soft on
ttcrime.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttHang on, are we not--

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttLewis--

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttAre we not putting back the handgun
ttrestrictions?!

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttWe're leaving 'em out.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttSir, we campaigned on this issue.
ttNow, I understand we took it out when
ttwe were in the low forties, but we
ttcan push it through now.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttAfter the elections.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttSir, we may never have an opportunity
ttlike this again. Let's take this 63
ttpercent out for a spin and see what
ttit can do.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttWe can't take it out for a spin, Lewis.
ttWe need it to get re-elected. For
ttreasons passing understanding, people
ttdo not relate guns to gun-related crime.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttRobin, you can brief the press this
ttafternoon. As of today, the crime
ttbill's priority one on the President's
ttdomestic agenda.

<b>ttttROBIN
</b>ttGot it.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttLeon, you're gonna run the war room.
ttWe're gonna need detailed projections
ttfor all the target districts by the
ttend of the week. And, Leon, don't be
tta nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do
ttwhat the N.R.A. does.

<b>ttttKODAK
</b>ttScare the shit out of 'em?

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttKODAK
</b>ttI can do that.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttLewis, we want you to be legislative
ttliaison on this. You're gonna run
ttthe show on the hill.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttCan I just say, to return to the
ttsubject for one moment, that it might
ttbe easier to fight a war on drugs if
ttwe weren't arming drug dealers.

tSHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a
ttemper.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttLewis, we've gotta fight the fights
ttwe can win.

<b>ttttLEWIS
</b>ttYes, sir.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttWe want to announce the crime bill at
ttthe State of the Union, which is 72
ttdays from today. The last nose count
ttput us 18 votes short.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttEighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you,
tteveryone. Janie, what's next?

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttThank you, Mr. President.

tThe meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Thank
tyou, Mr. President"'s as they exit.

</b>ttDid the President read the letter?

</b>ttSir, Ms. Wade's been thrown into the

ttShe hasn't even had a chance to read
ttthe report of the Quebec Conference.

tSYDNEY -- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes,
tcheck her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides,
tinstead, to hit the gas and swing away. The OTHERS are watching
tthis as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck.

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttYou're right. I haven't read it. If

tthave told them the Quebec Conference
ttwas made up of six professional hockey
ttteams. But what I do know is that it's
tttime for the President to run for
ttpresident again. Leon Kodak is as good
ttas it gets when it comes to electoral
ttstrategy, and I'm certain he's told the
ttPresident exactly what I'd tell him:
ttNail down Michigan and California,
ttwhere they make cars and airplanes --
ttand burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if
ttI had read these eight hundred pages,
ttI would have discovered that it's the
ttburning of fossil fuels that's been

ttthat the 20 percent reduction recommended
ttby the GDC is a necessary first step

tSYDNEY but, of course, can't.

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttt   (pause)
ttI'm afraid Sydney's right. Although
ttnot about Michigan and California.
ttThe President has asked me to convey
ttto you that he's sending his energy

ttreduction of 10 percent.

tThere's an uncomfortable silence in the room...

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttThe President is willing to go it
ttalone on this, but he's asking for,

</b>ttThe President's expecting our full

</b>ttYes, he is.

</b>ttThe President's dreamin', A.J.

<b>ttttSUSAN
</b>ttSydney!

ttthinks that the environmental
ttcommunity is going to whistle a
tthappy tune while rallying support

ttThis way...

tJANIE leads SYDNEY into...

tnotice things like the JFK Desk, the Seal of the President of

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttI hear it's pretty good.

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttMr. President, what you saw in there
ttwas nothing more than vanity run amok.
ttI was showing off for a colleague who
ttdoesn't think very much of me. It'd
ttbe a real injustice for you to hold the
ttGDC accountable for my behavior today.
ttOn top of which, I'm monumentally sorry

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttNo, I'll give you that.

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttMr. President--

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttDid you know that when the City
ttPlanners sat down to design
ttWashington, D.C., their intention was
ttto build a city that would intimidate
ttand humble foreign heads of state?
ttIt's true.

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttI didn't know that.


<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttThe White House has the single

</b>ttYes, sir, I'll convey your message.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttThe GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttIt's not gonna pass at 20 percent.
ttIt's a long shot at 10.

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttHow do you know that until you put
ttthe full weight of the White House
ttbehind--

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttSydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes
ttshy in the House. It can't be done.
ttBut I tell you what. I'll make you a

</b>ttTwenty-four votes?

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttAbsolutely. Listen, are you hungry?
ttI skipped breakfast. You wanna have
ttsome coffee? A donut or something?

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttSir, I'm a little intimidated by my

ttoff to a rocky and somewhat stilted
ttbeginning, but don't let that
ttdiminish the weight of my message:
ttThe GDC has been at every president
ttfor the last decade and a half that
ttglobal warming is a calamity, the
tteffects of which will be second only
ttto nuclear war. The best scientists
ttin the world have given you every

</b>ttYes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean,
ttI'm not sure. You know a lot more
ttthan I do -- but still, I have these
ttfeelings, and I don't think they're
ttwrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm
ttnot so sure it's all right to burn a
ttflag. I mean, it really bothers a lot
ttof people, and I don't know why you
ttthink it's okay. I hear Senator
ttRumson talk, and some of the things
tthe says sounds right to me, and I
ttthink, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?!
ttI mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad
tthates this guy!
ttWhy am I agreeing with him" And then
ttI think, "Well, maybe I'm not really
ttlike Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not
ttlike Dad either." But the point is
ttI'm the President's kid, and people
ttpay attention to what I say, and if
ttI say something different from what
ttyou say, it'll be embarrassing for
ttyou. So I can't just get up in social

tSHEPHERD knees down, cups her daughter's face in his hands,

ttThere's a fundamental difference
tbetween you and the Bob Rumsons of

<b>ttttLUCY
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttThe difference is that he says he
ttloves America. Saying you love

tstarts to stand.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttThat's all right, you can keep your

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>tt...and although I have not been
ttwilling to engage in his attacks on
ttme, I've been here three years and
ttthree days, and I can tell you
ttwithout hesitation: Being President
ttof this country is entirely about
ttcharacter.

tLEWIS enters with A.J. and KODAK.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttFor the record: Yes, I am a card-
ttcarrying member of the A.C.L.U. But
ttthe more important question is why
ttaren't you, Bob? This is an
ttorganization whose sole purpose is to
ttdefend the Bill of Rights, so it
ttnaturally begs the questions.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttWhy would a senator, his party's most
ttpowerful spokesman and a candidate
ttfor president, choose to reject
ttupholding the Constitution? If you
ttcan answer that question, then,
ttfolks, you're smarter than I am,
ttbecause I didn't understand it until
tta couple of minutes ago. Everybody
ttknows American isn't easy. America is
ttadvanced citizenship.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttYou gotta want it bad, 'cause it's
ttgonna put up a fight. It's gonna
ttsay, "You want free speech? Let's
ttsee you acknowledge a man whose words
ttmake your blood boil, who's standing
ttcenter stage and advocating, at the
tttop of his lungs, that which you
ttwould spend a lifetime opposing at the
tttop of yours. You want to claim
ttthis land as the land of the free,
ttthen the symbol of your country can't
ttjust be a flag; the symbol also has
ttto be one of its citizens exercising
tthis right to burn that flag in
ttprotest." Show me that, defend that,
ttcelebrate that in your classrooms.
ttThen you can stand up and sing about
ttthe land of the free. I've known Bob
ttRumson for years. I've been operating
ttunder the assumption that the reason
ttBob devotes so much time and energy to
ttshouting at the rain was that he simply
ttdidn't get it. Well, I was wrong.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttBob's problem isn't that he doesn't
ttget it. Bob's problem is that he
ttcan't sell it. Nobody has ever won
ttan election by talking about what I
ttwas just talking about.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttThis is a country made up of people
ttwith hard jobs that they're terrified
ttof losing. The roots of freedom are
ttof little or no interest to them at
ttthe moment. We are a nation afraid
ttto go out at night. We're a society
ttthat has assigned low priority to
tteducation and has looked the other
ttway while our public schools have
ttbeen decimated. We have serious
ttproblems to solve, and we need
ttserious men to solve them. And
ttwhatever your particular problem is,
ttfriend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is
ttnot the least bit interested in
ttsolving it. He is interested in two
ttthings and two things only: Making
ttyou afraid of it and telling you
ttwho's to blame for it. That, ladies
ttand gentlemen, is how you win
ttelections. You gather a group of
ttmiddle-aged, middle-class, middle-
ttincome voters who remember with
ttlonging an easier time, and you talk
ttto them about family and American
ttvalues and personal character. Then
ttyou have an old photo of the
ttPresident's girlfriend. You scream
ttabout patriotism and you tell them
ttshe's to blame for their lot in life,
ttyou go on television and you call her
tta whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done
ttnothing to you, Bob. She has done
ttnothing but put herself through law
ttschool, prosecute criminals for five
ttyears, represent the interests of
ttpublic school teachers for two years,
ttand lobby for the safety of our
ttnatural resources.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttYou want a character debate? Fine,
ttbut you better stick with me, 'cause
ttSydney Ellen Wade is way out of your
ttleague. I've loved two women in my
ttlife. I lost one to cancer, and I
ttlost the other 'cause I was so busy
ttkeeping my job I forgot to do my job.
ttWell that ends right now.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttTomorrow morning the White House is
ttsending a bill to Congress for its
ttconsideration. It's White House
ttResolution 455, an energy bill
ttrequiring a 20 percent reduction of the
ttemission of fossil fuels over the
ttnext ten years. It is by far the
ttmost aggressive stride ever taken in
ttthe fight to reverse the effects of
ttglobal warming. The other piece of
ttlegislation is the crime bill. As of
tttoday it no longer exists. I'm
ttthrowing it out. I'm throwing it out
ttand writing a law that makes sense.
ttYou cannot address crime prevention
ttwithout getting rid of assault
ttweapons and handguns.
ttI consider them a threat to national
ttsecurity, and I will go door to door
ttif I have to, but I'm gonna convince
ttAmericans that I'm right, and I'm
ttgonna get the guns. We've got
ttserous problems, and we need serious
ttmen, and if you want to talk about
ttcharacter, Bob, you'd better come at
ttme with more than a burning flag and
tta membership card. If you want to
tttalk about character and American
ttvalues, fine. Just tell me where and
ttwhen, and I'll show up. This is a
tttime for serious men, Bob, and your
ttfifteen minutes are up. My name's

<b>ttttLUCY
</b>ttArticle 2, Section 3, of the U.S.
ttConstitution. Executive Powers.
ttt   (reading)
tt"He shall, from time to time, give to
ttthe Congress information of the State
ttof the Union, and recommend to their
ttconsideration such measures as he
ttshall judge necessary and expedient."

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttSounds right up your alley.

tSHEPHERD looks at his old friend and extends his hand for a
tdeeply-felt handshake. A.J. grasps SHEPHERD's hand and then
tpulls him into a strong embrace.

tA.J. whispers a shout into SHEPHERD's ear--

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttGive 'em hell, Andy.

tA.J. pulls away, leaving SHEPHERD to enjoy the moment without
thaving to speak--

<b>ttttA.J.
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttYou've got 30 seconds, Mr. President.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttThank you.
ttt   (to LUCY)
ttI'll see you afterward. I want a
ttcritique.

tThe room clears out...revealing SYDNEY, dressed like the
tFirst Lady she's soon to be, sitting against the window sill.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttThere's been something I've been
tttrying to give you since our first
ttdate. I tried a bunch of times, but
ttsomehow I've always managed to trip
ttover my job.
ttt   (beat)
ttAnyay...

tSHEPHERD has picked his black canvas gym bag with the gold
tPresidential seal.

tHe reaches in the bag and pulls out a bouquet of flowers.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (continuing)
ttThese are for you.

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttThey're beautiful.

tJANIE pokes her head in.

<b>ttttJANIE
</b>ttMr. President?

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttGotta go.

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttShould I stay here?

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttNo, walk with me.

tThey exit into a hallway lined with Congressional STAFFERS,
tSECRET SERVICE, CAPITOL SECURITY, WHITE HOUSE STAFF, and,
tmost prominently, A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, JANIE and KODAK.

tSYDNEY is still clutching her flowers as they near the double
tdoors to the House Chamber--

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttHow'd you finally do it?

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttt   (raising his voice
ttt    above the cheering)
ttDo what?

<b>ttttSYDNEY
</b>ttManage to give a woman flowers and
ttbe President at the same time.

<b>ttttSHEPHERD
</b>ttWell...it turns out I've got a rose
ttgarden.

tSYDNEY is stopped in her tracks as--

t--the doors to the Chamber fly open--

<b>ttttDOORKEEPER
</b>ttMr. Speaker!!!...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
<b>ttUNITED STATES!!!
</b>
tThe CHAMBER leaps to its feet in a thunderous ovation,
tshouts of "Bravo!" from the gallery...

tAt the back, LEWIS and ROBIN and KODAK are trying to maintain
ttheir professional cool, but it's a moment impossible not to
tget caught up in...SYDNEY is clutching her flowers with both
thands...SHEPHERD is making his way down the aisle, shaking
thands and receiving congratulations and good wishes, and we

<b>tFADE OUT.
