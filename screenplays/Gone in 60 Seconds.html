t"I wonder," Toad said to himself presently, "I wonder
tif this sort of car starts easily?"
ttNext moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he
tfound that he had hold of the handle and was turning
tit. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old
tpassion seized on Toad and completely mastered him,
tbody and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the
tcar devoured the street, he was only conscious
tthat he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and
thighest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling
this instincts, living his hour, reckless of what
tmight come to him... "

t-- Kenneth Grahame, "THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS"







t"All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty
thood... "

t-- Bruce Springsteen, "THUNDER ROAD"









<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT
</b>
tThe streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew
tof a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los
tAngeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars
texcept -

<b>tA '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500
</b>
tSilver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air
tscoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool
tbefore dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then
tSOMEONE approaches...

tThrough the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ...
tHe's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer
tthat refuses to fade ...

tThis is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's
tquite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern
tCalifornia ...

tMemphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert
tcrash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ...
tAdmiring it ... Adoring it ...

tBut then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver -
tATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for:

<b>ttttATLEY JACKSON
</b>ttYou gonna steal her or kneel down to
tther and pray -- ?

tMemphis looks at him, still enthralled...

ttttATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)
ttI know, I know ... It's Eleanor ...
ttJust take her, slick. - -

tAnd Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ...
tNo one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his
tcoat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the
tdoor ...

tWatch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another
tpocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION

tA RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small
tsocket-like device - is pressed into the
tignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles
tlike a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds.

tHe takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the
tdeck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials.
tAnd Memphis floors it... And off they tear...

tThe look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand
tre-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones,
tfixed and fumy ...

tHe slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in
tbehind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ...

tOn they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort...

tExcept that, from seemingly out of nowhere --

<b>tA POLICE CAR
</b>
tappears behind them...

tAnd Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races
tthrough a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And
tDonny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their
trespective vehicles...

tThe UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttProblem, Officer?

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttYes. You're under arrest -- ?

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttFor running a stop sign?

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttFor Grand Theft Auto -

tAnd off of Donny's look --

tWe go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding
ttoward him, sirens wailing...

tQUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning
tharbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music
t... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ...

tMemphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis
tgutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy
tpursuit ...

tAnd now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson,
theading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of
tcruisers himself ...

tMemphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up
tahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so
tfast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ...

tGuns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and
ta PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on
tto the roadblock ...

tAnd, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis
tbangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake --
tAnd the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And
tMemphis takes the HARD LEFT ...

tAnd he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower
tGrand... Looking down ...

tHe can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being
tchased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER,
tthe Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ...

tLanding with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.

<b>tEXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER
</b>
tRescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His
tleg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny
tAstricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ...

tA POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps

<b>tDETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK
</b>
tof G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck
tis mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility

tCastlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS..

</b>ttAstricky. And Jackson. No sign of
ttRaines...

<b>ttttDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
</b>ttWell, then it's all for naught,
ttain't it, Hawkings?

tCastlebeck looks out over the mess ... And then looks up...
tBecause, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked. It is the
tShelby. With Memphis leaning against its hood...

tCastlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. So he walks
ttoward it, hand on hip...

</b>ttLeg's all banged-up. He made a

</b>ttLet them go. And I'll leave ...

ttat a blind man without me by your side ...

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttYou have my word...

</b>ttGet out of here, then. Now.

tAnd Memphis makes to get into the Shelby...

<b>ttttDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
</b>ttLeave the car, Randall ...

tMemphis nods ... Takes one last look at the Shelby... Sorry to 
tleave it behind ... And he runs off into the mists of Lower
tGrand ...

tCastlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...

<b>ttttDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
</b>ttArright, let lim go. Cite him for
ttrolling the stop ... And cite old
ttAtley for driving to endanger ...

<b>ttttHAWKINGS
</b>ttWhat are you talking about, Rollie? We're
ttspringing 'em? Just like that?

tAnd off of Donny's surprised look, as Springsteen wails to

tSome 400 miles North of Los Angeles, Independence is a one
thorse town, and the horse has died... Single stop light,

tTom starts to say "not really". Instead, he nods. Memphis takes a

tFLATTENED, for easy shelving ...

tMidnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE:
tWatch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the

tAn enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the-
tart table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes.

tAn antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of

tagainst the rear wall ...

tJars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches
tcram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is

</b>
tHe wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A
tRichard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a
tcobra. The liegelord of downtown...

tAnd now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a
twide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ... As noisy
tas it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's

tA BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and

ttNo, no. You don't kill me, because

</b>ttOne more, girl -

tHe pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ...
tMirror Man plucks something from the trunk ...

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttTake it back, Freb --

<b>ttttMIRROR MAN
</b>ttHey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -

tDonny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man ... But Mirror Man
tholds on ... They tug back and forth ... The bag DROPS ...
tSplitting on the ground, behind the car. Spilling heroin.

ttttMIRROR MAN (cont'd)
ttNow, see what you--

tBut a BANG! BANG! on the front gate, gives them all pause.

</b>ttone minute -- !

tAnd the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and
tdevices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto.

tMemphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ...
tPuts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only
tthere's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of
tthe Caddy ... But there's no time...

tFor the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in.

tCastlebeck takes out a WALKIE ... Barks into it ...

</b>ttRun me down a tag - 329 HRO. Cadillac.

tHe clicks off ... Otto and Memphis share one ... A glance to the
tsmack ... Castlebeck is a mere inches from it ...

<b>ttttOTTO
</b>ttNo faith in our new-found goodness,
ttDetective ...?

<b>ttttDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
</b>ttSure. But sometimes we got to
ttcreate some numbers. The task force

tBefore they can respond, the radio crackles ...

</b>tt329 HRO. There's no want on the license at
ttthis time...

tCastlebeck looks disappointed... Otto grins ... Castlebeck stares
tat the Caddy, still unconvinced...

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttYou're thinking: okay, there's no want ...
ttBut they probably stripped its guts and
ttcrated 'em up, right ... ?

<b>ttttDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
</b>ttSomething like that -

tMemphis opens the driver's side door ... Gestures Castlebeck in
t... Castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttLet her rip ...

tAnd Castlebeck starts the car...

tANGLE - TAILPIPE ... WHOOSH! All of the heroin on the flo is blown
taway by the exhaust ... Memphis winks to Otto ... Castlebeck seems
tsatisfied ... Gets out.

</b>ttOkay, then. I'll catch you later,

</b>ttRight ...

tCastlebeck stops at the gate... Turns back to them...

ttgood this time ...

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttConsider me gone, Detective --

<b>ttttDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
</b>ttI'll catch you later, Randall --

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttDouble-meaning intended --

<b>ttttDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK
</b>ttYou betcha --

tAnd Memphis races off ...

<b>tEXT. OTTO'S SALVAGE - DAY
</b>
tOtto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee
tand eating donuts ... They are exhausted... Memphis and Kip pull
tup in Eleanor... He hands Otto the briefcase. Otto opens it... All
tthat cash...

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttSplit it up. Any word on Donny?

<b>ttttOTTO
</b>ttHe's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttWhat happened to Sway?

<b>ttttOTTO
</b>ttShe left...

tHe nods ... The boys are huddled together...

<b>ttttMIRROR MAN
</b>ttPoor Toby, man...

tA few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:

<b>ttttTHE SPHINX 
</b>ttIf his premature demise has, in some way,
ttenlightened the rest of you as to the
ttgrim finish below the glossy veneer of
ttcriminal life, and inspired you to change
ttyour ways, then his death carries with it
ttan inherent nobility. And a supreme
ttglory. We should all be so fortunate.
ttYou can say 'Poor Toby." I say: "Poor us.."

tThey all stare at him, stunned...

<b>ttttFREB
</b>ttYou spoke

tThe Sphinx shrugs...

<b>ttttTUMBLER
</b>ttSay something else, man

tBut The Sphinx lapses back into his silence ... Nibbles a donut
t... Sips coffee ... Memphis smiles ... He takes a stack of bills
tfrom the briefcase... To Kip:

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttYou remember where you got this
ttEleanor -- ?

<b>ttttKIP
</b>ttSure, man --

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttShe's for sale. They're asking forty thousand.
ttGive 'em sixty ...

tAnd he hands Kip the cash ...

<b>ttttKIP
</b>ttYou want me to buy her?

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttShocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done.
ttI've never actually paid for a car. I want
ttto see what it feels like

tKip nods ... Memphis looks at a grinning Otto ...

<b>ttttOTTO
</b>ttDinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is
ttnow...

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttI'll see you soon --

<b>ttttKIP
</b>ttWhere you off to -- ?

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttThought I'd go for a ride -

tHe smiles. The others do, too. Memphis heads for Eleanor.

<b>ttttKIP
</b>ttHey, Memphis -- ?

tMemphis turns back...

ttttKIP (cont'd)
ttI'll see you, right?

tMemphis nods ...

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttYou'll see me ...

tAnd we PRE-LAP Sammy John's "Chevy Van" and CUT TO:

<b>tINT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY
</b>
tSway, underneath a Daytona... We only see her from the waist down
t... Hands on her waist ... Pulls her gently out. Memphis. He
tbrings her to her feet ...

<b>ttttSWAY
</b>ttWhat are you doing... ?

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttSeeing if you wanted to go for a ride?

tAnd he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from
ther cheek...

<b>ttttSWAY
</b>ttI can't. I got a back load of repairs
ttand one of the mechanics called in
ttsick and I haven't slept and--
ttt(stops short; sees the new Eleanor
tttoutside)
ttWhere to -- ?

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttI dunno. I know a place.

tShe looks at him... Long and hard...

<b>ttttSWAY
</b>ttThis time it's for real?

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttOh, yeah. For real, point-five.

<b>tEXT. BACCHIOCHI'S - DAY
</b>
tAnd Memphis opens the passenger door for her ... And she gets
tin... And she smiles ... And Memphis climbs behind the wheel. He
tneutral-drops Eleanor, chirping off ...

<b>tEXT. CONTAINER SHIP - LONG BEACH HARBOR - DAY
</b>
tAs two TUGS guide the giant freighter away from the docks ... All
tthose containers ... Filled with cars ... But here comes a COAST
tGUARD CUTTER ... Churning for the ship ...

tDetectives Castlebeck and Drycoff on the deck ... Stopping this
tone cold...

<b>tEXT. LANDFILL - RHODE ISLAND - DAY
</b>
tA vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth. Deserted,
texcept for THE PANEL VAN parked dead center. Digger and Butz slide
tthe casket from the van, parked before an ALREADY DUG GRAVE.

tAs they move the casket, a KNOCKING from inside. A POUNDING. And
tmuffled CRIES. Digger and Butz exchange a horrified glance... They
tstare at the casket, spooked.

<b>ttttBUTZ
</b>ttDo you believe this?

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>ttWhat should we do?

<b>ttttBUTZ
</b>ttWe gotta do what we gotta do --

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>ttShit. I hate the screamers, man. Why
ttcan't he finish the freakin' job?

<b>ttttBUTZ
</b>ttForget about it. Occupational hazard,
ttDigger. C'mon...

tAnd just as we think they're sure to open it -- they DROP THE
<b>tCASKET INTO THE HOLE -- !
</b>
tAnd begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant
tthumping and pounding and yelling -- And soon the casket is
tcovered in dirt. Gone.

tAnd we PRE-LAP The Turtles' pop gem "Eleanor" ("You got a thing
tabout you/I just can't live without you/I really want
tyou/ Eleanor near me...")  CUT TO:

<b>tEXT. THE 405 FREEWAY NORTH - ELEANOR - MOVING - DAY
</b>
tMemphis driving. Sway riding shotgun. Long Beach at their backs
t... Memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel... He loves
tdriving this car. Sway watches him. He feels it --

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttWhat -- ?

<b>ttttSWAY
</b>ttNothing. Just that if I was less
ttsecure, I might think you were more
ttinto Eleanor than you are me...

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttShe does have one thing you don't.

<b>ttttSWAY
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttMEMPHIS
</b>ttBench seats.

tAnd he grins ... Pats the seat beside him... And Sway slides
tclose... He throws his arm around her ...

tAnd off they go ... As The Turtles' ("Eleanor/Gee, I think you're
tswell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc.")
tSING ON... And we hear:

<b>ttttMEMPHIS (O.S.)
</b>ttYou like bingo -- ?

tAnd Eleanor drives away from us ... Into the searing horizon line
t... Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist
tpattern that is the American road.

<b>tTHE END
