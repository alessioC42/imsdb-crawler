<b>1tEXT.    LATE 1942.    THE SAHARA DESERT.    DAY.
</b>
SILENCE.  THE DESERT seen from the air.  An ocean of dunes  for mile 
after mile.  The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to 
black.

An old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara.  Its shadow swims over the 
contours of sand.

A woman's voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track.  Szerelem, 
szerelem, she cries, in a haunting lament for her loved one.

INSIDE the aeroplane are two figures.  One,  A WOMAN, seems to be 
asleep.  Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit.  THE 
PILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet.  He is singing, too, 
but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's 
plaintive voice.

The plane shudders over a ridge.  Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF MEN 
AND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks 
and armored vehicles.  An OFFICER, GERMAN, focuses his field glasses.  
The glasses pick out the MARKINGS on the plane.  They are English.  An 
ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels furiously.

Shocking bursts of GUNFIRE.  Explosions rock the plane, which lurches 
violently.  THE WOMAN SLUMPS FORWARD, slamming her head against the 
instruments.  The pilot grabs her, pulls her back, but she's not 
conscious.  The fuel tank above their heads is punctured.  It sprays 
them both, then EXPLODES.

THE MAN FALLS OUT OF THE SKY, clinging to his dead lover.  The are both 
ON FIRE.  She is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely.  He 
looks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries 
them slowly to earth.  Even his helmet is on fire, but the man makes no 
sound as the flames erase all that matters - his name, his past, his 
face, his lover...


<b>2tEXT.    THE DESERT.    1942.    DAY.
</b>
THE PILOT HAS BEEN RESCUED BY BEDOUIN TRIBESMEN.  Behind them the 
wreckage of the plane, still smoking, the Arabs picking over it.  A 
SILVER THIMBLE glints in the sun, is retrieved.  Another man comes 
across A LARGE LEATHER-BOUND BOOK and takes it over to the Pilot.  The 
Pilot is charred.  His helmet has melted into his head.  He's oblivious 
to this, cares only about the woman who crashed with him.  He twists 
frantically to find her.  Two men pick him up and carry him across to a 
litter where they carefully wrap him in blankets.


<b>3tEXT.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.
</b>
The Pilot is being carried across the desert.  A mask covers his face.  
His view of the world is through the slats of reed.  He glimpses 
camels, fierce low sun, the men who carry him.


<b>4tEXT.    AN  OASIS.    DUSK.
</b>
The Pilot sees a man squat down beside him, takes a date from a sack 
and begin to chew it.  Carefully, the Bedouin eases the mask from the 
Pilot's face, leaving bandages of cloth and oil, but revealing a mouth.  
He stops chewing and passes the pulped date into the Pilot's mouth.  
Mouth to mouth.


4a*.tEXT.    DESERT.    DAWN.

THE CARAVANSERAI CROSSES THE DESERT, silhouetted against the dunes.


<b>5tEXT.    AN  OASIS.    NIGHT.
</b>
The SOUND OF GLASS, of tiny chimes.  A music of glass.

AN ARAB HEAD APPEARS ON A MOVING TABLE IN THE DESERT.  It floats in 
darkness, shimmering from the light of a fire.  The image develops to 
reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang DOZENS OF 
SMALL GLASS BOTTLES, on different lengths of string and wire.  He could 
be an angel.

The man approaches the litter which carries the Pilot.  He's still in 
the protective reed mask, wrapped in blankets.  The MERCHANT DOCTOR 
stands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep 
into the sand, then moves away, free of the yoke, which balances in the 
support of the two crutches.  He puts some liquid in the Pilot's 
tongue, whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll.  Then he slowly sets 
about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the Pilot's 
flesh.

The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and 
MAKES A SKIN CUP with the soles of his feet, then leans back to pluck, 
hardly looking, certain bottles, which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl 
he'd made with his feet.  This mixture he uses to anoint the burned 
skin.  Next he finds green-black PASTE - ground Peacock Bone - and 
BEGINS TO RUB IT on to the Pilot's rib cage.  All the while he us 
humming and chanting.  The bottles continue to jingle.


<b>6*.tEXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    EARLY 1945.    DAY.
</b>
The sand gives way to trees, the jingling bottles to distant church 
bells, as A CONVOY OF TWENTY TRUCKS - Red Cross vehicles and some 
supply vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill road.  The war in Italy is 
largely over and the Allies are moving up the country, the wounded and 
supply lines slowly following.


<b>7*.tINT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    DAY.
</b>
A young CANADIAN NURSE, HANA, sits in a truck full of patients.  Hana 
pays special care to the PATIENT lying in the stretcher alongside her.  
This is the PILOT - now known as THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  A web of scars 
covers the Patient's face and body.  They have the quality of a livid 
tattoo, magenta and green-black.  The hair has largely gone and the 
effect is curious, lassoing his features, the strong nose, the eyes 
liquid.  It's a warrior's face.  But he has no physical strength.  He 
coughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road.


<b>8*.tEXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.
</b>
A JEEP pulls out of the line and approaches the Red Cross truck 
containing Hana and the Patient.  The horn blows and Hana looks out to 
see it contains her best friend, JAN.  TWO YOUNG SOLDIERS sit up front, 
one driving, both grinning.  Jan signals for Hana's attention.

<b>tttJAN
</b>ttThere's meant to be lace in the next
ttvillage - the boys are taking me.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI'm not sewing anything else.

<b>tttJAN
</b>tttt(mischievously)
ttYou don't have any money, do you?  
ttJust in case there's silk.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttNo!

<b>tttJAN
</b>ttHana, I know you do!

Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS.  The two hands - 
hers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side 
by side.  They laugh at the effort.  Jan's GOLD BRACELET catches the 
sun and glints.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI'm not sewing anything else for you!

<b>tttJAN
</b>tttt(getting the money)
ttI love you.

The Jeep accelerates away.  Hana sighs to the patient.

Suddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a MINE.  
The jeep is THROWN into the air.  The convoy halts and there's chaos as 
soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles.  Hana runs the 
other way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by 
a soldier.


<b>9*.tEXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    LATER.
</b>
-- and there's still chaos as two SAPPERS arrive on motorcycles.  One 
of them, a SIKH, wears a turban.

The motorcycles arrive at the front of the convoy.  A nurse, MARY, is 
helping a doctor, OLIVER, attend to the injured driver.  The other two 
bodies are covered with blankets.  There's blood everywhere.  The Sikh 
and his colleague pull out the paraphernalia of their bomb disposal 
equipment.


<b>10tEXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.
</b>
KIP, the Sikh Lieutenant, and HARDY, his sergeant, explore the road 
ahead of the becalmed convoy, using saucer-like METAL DETECTORS and 
HEADSETS.  Kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly focused as they inch 
along the debris-strewn road.  He stiffens as he registers metal.  With 
a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-caked surface.  Something 
GLEAMS.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEET walks across his vision as HANA 
HURRIES PAST, walking carelessly up the road.  It's so surreal that 
neither man registers at first, and then Kip is shouting.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttHey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!

<b>tttHARDY
</b>ttDon't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!

 Hana stops.  Hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.

<b>tttHARDY
</b>tttt(as he approaches)
ttGood, that's good, just stay still for me
ttand then we're going to be fine.

He arrives at Hana.  Then grabs her.  He'd like to slap her face.

<b>tttHARDY
</b>ttWhat are you doing?!  What the bloody 
tthell do you think you're doing?

By way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet.  Jan's 
BRACELET lies in the mud.  Hardy bends down and collects the mangled 
bracelet, presses it into Hana's hands.


<b>11tEXT.    VILLAGE.    DUSK.
</b>
The CONVOY is threading through A RUINED VILLAGE, passing the souvenirs 
of war.  An overturned vehicle now used as a game by some children, 
dejected refugees tramping along the side of the road.  From the end of 
one of the buildings are hanging HALF A DOZEN CORPSES, strung upside 
down with crude placards denouncing, in Italian, their collaboration 
with the Nazis.


<b>12tINT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    CONTINUOUS.
</b>
Hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck, the Patient 
swaying alongside her.  She puts out her hand to steady him.


<b>13*.tEXT.    CONVOY SITE, ITALY.    DUSK.
</b>
THE CONVOY is making a PITSTOP.  The trucks are silhouetted in a line.  
Hana helps lift the Patient's stretcher onto the ground.  She bends to 
him.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttDo you need something?

The Patient nods.  Hana gets up to prepare MORPHINE INJECTION from a 
small kit.  Mary arrives.  Touches Hana gently, conscious of her grief 
for Jan's death.

<b>tttMARY
</b>ttAre you okay?  Oh God, Hana, you were
ttlike sisters.

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(sighs angrily)
ttWe keep moving him - in and out of the
tttruck.  Why?  He's dying.  What's the point?

<b>tttMARY
</b>ttWell, we can't hardly leave him.  Do
ttyou mean leave him?  We can't.

Hana has settled down beside the Patient's stretcher.  She draws 
herself up against the night.  On the hill above, she can see the 
outline of A SMALL MONASTERY in the moonlight.  She's crying, her face 
a frozen mask.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI must be a curse.  Anybody who loves me,
ttanybody who gets close to me -
ttor I must be cursed.  Which is it?

The Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand.


<b>14tEXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.
</b>
Hana is investigating the MONASTERY OF ST. ANNA, wandering through its 
overgrown gardens, past a pond.  What sanctuary it seems to offer.


<b>15*.tINT.    THE MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.
</b>
Hana explores via a gaping hole in a LIBRARY where the walls have 
collapsed from shelling.  The garden intrudes, ivy curls around the 
shelves.  Bloated books lie abandoned, and there's a PIANO tiled up on 
one side.  Hana presses the keys through the filthy tarpaulin which 
covers it.  Everywhere there are signs of a brief German occupation.


15a*.tINT.    MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.

Past the Library is a CLOISTERS, drenched with silver light.


15b*.tINT.    THE MONASTERY STAIRS.    DAY.

Hana goes upstairs, negotiating a huge VOID in the stone treads two 
thirds of the way up.


15c*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

She comes across a small CHAPEL, with the remains of murals and an 
altar pressed into service by the Germans as a table.  Hana finds an 
old bed, and a mattress.


<b>16tEXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.
</b>
Hana comes out, passes a DRY WATER TROUGH.  She hears a rustling on the 
gravel and turns to see A TORTOISE ambling towards the trough.  On cue 
there's A GURGLING SOUND.  THE HANDLELESS PUMP IS SUDDENLY GUSHING, 
splashing water everywhere.  The Tortoise, clearly arriving for this, 
enjoys a welcome shower.  Hana goes to the trough, dips her hands into 
the water.  Looks around her, and makes a decision.


<b>17tEXT.    CONVOY SITE.    ITALY.    DAY.
</b>
The Convoy is in the final stages of loading up.  Oliver passes the 
vehicles, deep in dispute with a determined Hana, who is carrying some 
sacks of rice.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttThe war's over - you told me yourself.
ttHow can it be desertion?

<b>tttOLIVER
</b>ttIt's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean
ttliterally.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhen he dies I'll catch up.

Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions, 
then lays another blanket over the Patient.

<b>tttOLIVER
</b>ttIt's not safe here.  The whole country's
ttcrawling with Bandits and Germans and God
ttknows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it.
ttYou're not, this is natural - it's shock.  
ttFor all of us.  Hana -

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.

<b>tttOLIVER
</b>tttt(clutching at straws)
ttAnd what if he really is a spy?

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(impatiently)
ttHe can't even move.

<b>tttOLIVER
</b>ttIf anything happened to you I'd never
ttforgive myself.

Hana nods.  A tiny smile.  Oliver shrugs helplessly.

<b>tttOLIVER
</b>ttWe're heading for Leghorn.  Livorno the
ttItalians call it.  We'll expect you.


<b>18*.tINT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.
</b>
TWO SOLDIERS are helping Mary and Hana carry the Patient into the 
monastery.  Hana indicates the stairs.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttUp there.

They struggle up the stairs, one of the Soldiers gasping as he narrowly 
avoids falling into the void in the stairs.  The cot almost tips up, at 
which the Patient SUDDENLY SPEAKS, his voice cracked and rasping, but 
still clearly aristocratic.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttThere was a Prince, who was dying, and
tthe was carried up the tower at Pisa so he
ttcould die with a view of the Tuscan Hills.
ttAm I that Prince?

Hana laughs.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttBecause you're leaning?  No, you're 
ttjust on an angle.  You're too heavy!

Mary laughs.  They reach the landing.  Hana kicks open the door to the 
<b>CHAPEL.
</b>
<b>tttHANA
</b>ttIn here.


18a*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Hana lets Mary take the weight while she goes to the bed and pulls away 
the drapes, sending up a cloud of dust.  They lower the Patient onto 
the bed.  She turns to the SOLDIERS.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttThank you.

She shuts the door on them, leaving Mary staring aghast at the room, 
its faded frescoes, its mold, its chaos.  Hana smiles, opens a shutter 
to let a fierce envelope of light into the room.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttGood.

tShe goes to Mary and hugs her.


<b>19*.tINT.    HANA'S ROOM.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.
</b>
A smaller upstairs room completely bare.  As Hana tugs off her uniform, 
she looks out of the window to see the departing Convoy.  A cotton 
dress goes on over her head and she emerges looking suddenly younger 
and rather fragile.   THROUGH THE DAMAGED FLOOR OF HER ROOM SHE HAS A 
<b>VIEW OF THE PATIENT BELOW HER.  SHE LOOKS AT HIM.  NOW SHE HAS SCISSORS 
</b><b>AND STARTS TO CUT OFF HER HAIR, NOT AGGRESSIVELY, BUT IN A GESTURE OF A 
</b><b>NEW BEGINNING.
</b>

19a*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

HANA walks down to the Patient's Room and stands in the doorway.  The 
Patient turns his head to her.  He's grinning.  He puts up a thumb.  On 
the track a song begins:  Some Other Time.


<b>20*.tEXT.  BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.  1938.  LATE DAY.
</b>
THE SONG CONTINUED IN THE DESERT where we find the singer - PETER 
MADOX, a weather-beaten man who is working on the guts of an BATTERED 
TIGER MOTH AEROPLANE.  His face is blackened with oil.  A second 
European, ALMxc1SY, stands beside him, holding tools and a section of the 
camshaft.  Madox yanks out a perished rubber hose and holds it up for 
Almasy to inspect.  Behind them is an ENCAMPMENT - some camels foraging 
in the meager scrub, half a dozen black tents of the BEDOUIN: guides 
and servants to the Almxe1sy/Madox Expedition.  It's 1938 and the whole 
continent is full of such expeditions, competing with each other, 
pursuing lost treasures, sources of rivers, hidden cities.

D'AGOSTINO, the team's Italian ARCHEOLOGIST, drives towards the plane 
in one of the expedition's adapted FORD MOTORCARS.  He gets out 
carrying a large earthenware WATER JAR.  He looks very pleased with 
himself as he shows the jar to Almxe1sy and then passes it to Madox.

<b>tttD'AGOSTINO
</b>ttThirsty?

<b>tttMADOX
</b>tttt(sniffing inside)
ttWhat's this?

<b>tttD'AGOSTINO
</b>ttDon't drink it!

He reaches for the jug, then pours out a little sludge - it's a 
brackish and stinks.  Madox makes a face.

<b>tttD'AGOSTINO
</b>ttI can't guarantee the vintage, my 
ttfriends.  I just dug it out of the hill.

Madox and Almxe1sy have seen many such jugs.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttExcellent.  That's terrific, D'Ag.
tttt(to Almxe1sy, of a tool)
ttToss that up, would you.

<b>tttD'AGOSTINO
</b>tttt(mischievously)
ttThere are some others.


<b>21tEXT.    POTTERY HILL.    DAY.
</b>
<b>THE BASE OF A HILL SEEMS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF POTTERY JARS.
</b>
D'Agostino emerges over the brow of a dune, leading Madox and Almxe1sy.  
The other members of the team are already there - BERMANN, a German 
PHOTOGRAPHER and FOUAD, EGYPTOLOGIST from Cairo.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>tttt(to Almxe1sy, astonished)
ttMy God, look at this!

They bend to touch the jars, literally hundreds of them, mostly broken, 
piled on top of each other.  Bermann approaches them, carrying his 
tripod.

<b>tttBERMANN
</b>ttIncredible, Hmm?  Quite incredible.

<b>tttD'AGOSTINO
</b>ttI've never seen anything like it.  There 
ttwould have been enough water here to
ttserve an army.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(gloomily)
ttWhich means we're in the wrong place.

Almxe1sy speaks with a slight but unmistakable European accent.

<b>tttD'AGOSTINO
</b>ttWhy?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWould you stockpile water near to an
ttOasis?  There can't be a natural spring
ttwithin fifty miles of here.

<b>tttFOUAD
</b>ttOr they didn't know of one.

<b>tttBERMANN
</b>ttSo, it may not be Zerzura, still
ttincredible.

<b>tttD'AGOSTINO
</b>tttt(nodding, delighted)
ttA pottery hill!

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttA wild goose chase.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>tttt(firmly)
ttNo.

Almxe1sy gives him a look.  But Madox will have none of it.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttNo.  Now we look in the other places.
ttWe're eliminating.

The unmistakable buzz of AN AEROPLANE distracts them.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttGood, and here comes reinforcements.


21a*.tEXT.    BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DAY.

LATER and a smart new aeroplane, a STEERMAN, makes a smooth landing on 
the flat desert.  The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals.  
Almxe1sy is not with them.  He's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic.

A young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane.  They 
are GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE CLIFTON.

And it's immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the plane-
crash at the beginning of the film.

Madox makes all the introductions.  Hands are shaken, hellos all round, 
as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear.  Geoffrey removes 
his helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture, 
produces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off the cork with a flourish.

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttI hereby Christen us the International
ttSand Club!


<b>22tEXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    LATE DAY.
</b>
The party is in the shade of the tents.  Almxe1sy joins the group.  Madox 
nods over to the Clifton plane.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttMarvelous plane.  Did you look?

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>tttt(beaming at Almxe1sy)
ttIsn't it?  Wedding present from
ttKatharine's parents.  I'm calling it
ttRupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttWe can finally consign my old bird
ttto the scrapheap.

tAlmxe1sy smiles and walks on towards the others.

<b>tttD'AGOSTINO
</b>ttMrs. Clifton - Count Almasy.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(smiling, offering her hand)
ttGeoffrey gave me your monograph when
ttI was reading up on the desert.
ttVery impressive.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(stiff)
ttThank you.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI wanted to meet a man who could write
ttsuch a long paper with so few adjectives.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttA thing is still a thing no matter what
ttyou place in front of it.  Big car, slow
ttcar, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>tttt(joining them and joining in)
ttA broken car?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttStill a car.

<b>tttCLIFFTON
</b>tttt(hands them champagne)
ttNot much use, though.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttLove?  Romantic love, platonic love,
ttfilial love - ?  Quite different things,
ttsurely?

<b>tttCLIFTON 
</b>tttt(hugging Katharine)
ttUxoriousness - that's my favorite kind
ttof love.  Excessive love of one's wife.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(a dry smile)
ttThere you have me.


<b>23tINT.  THE PATIENT'S ROOM.  THE MONASTERY.  MORNING.
</b>
The morning floods into the room.  The Patient lies, lost in the 
desert.  Then a sudden CLATTERING NOISE disturbs him.


<b>24tINT.   STAIRS, THE MONASTERY.   DAY.
</b>
Hana is dropping armfuls of books into the cavities of the damaged 
stairs, and with others, she is improvising new steps.  The heavy 
volumes are perfect for treading on.


<b>25tINT.   LIBRARY.   DAY.
</b>
Hana comes in, gathers up another armful of books and carries them out 
to continue her stair repairs.


<b>26*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
</b>
Hana enters.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttWhat was all the banging?  Were you
ttfighting rats or the entire German army?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI was repairing the stairs.  I found a
ttlibrary and the books were very useful.

Hana shrugs.  She's attending to him, pulling back the sheets, plumping 
up the pillows.  He's short of breath.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttBefore you find too many uses for these
ttbooks would you read some to me?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI think they're all in Italian, but I'll
ttlook, yes.  What about your own book?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>tttt(reluctant)
ttMy book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we
ttcan read him.

Hana picks up the book and hands it to him.  Then she starts rummaging 
in her pockets.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttOh - I've found plums.  We have plums
ttin the orchard.  We have an orchard!

She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttThank you.

His mouth works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping 
from the mouth.  Hana mops it up.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttThe plumness of this plum.

A noise, GURGLING sound, disturbs them.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttWhat's that?


<b>27tINT/EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.
</b>
Hana comes through the Cloisters into the garden as the gurgling 
increases.  She's in time to catch the TORTOISE arriving once again in 
the WATER TROUGH just as it starts to gush with water.  She shouts up 
to The Patient's open window.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWater!
tttt(bends to the Tortois)
ttYou hear it, too, don't you!


<b>28tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
</b>
Close on the HERODOTUS.  The Patient opens its cover, held together by 
leather ties.  Loose PAPERS, PHOTOGRAPHS, HAND-DRAWN MAPS AND SKETCHES 
are all collected between the pages.  He claws at some water-colors 
which appear to be based on CAVE PAINTINGS - figures, dark-skinned 
warriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with 
plumes in their hair - arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like 
those of Matisse.  Some appear to be swimming, another is diving.  Then 
the Patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel SPILLS to 
the floor with a crack.

A SHOT RINGS OUT, disturbing the evening meal.  Almxe1sy and others go 
outside.  Silhouetted on a ridge, a group of men sit astride camels.  
One of them holds his rifle aloft, clearly pointing towards the sky - 
means friend.  Fouad peers at the horizon.

<b>tttFOUAD
</b>ttEuropean, I think, with guides.

ALMxc1SY AND MADOX WALK OUT TO INTERCEPT THE ARRIVALS as the first Arab 
dismounts, the procession of camels splaying out as if in collapse.  
Almxe1sy speaks in Arabic, exchanging the ritual greetings.

DURING THIS, FENELON-BARNES, sole European in this expedition, has 
finally persuaded his camel to sit, and dismounts irritably, slapping 
the animal in disgust.

<b>tttFENELON-BARNES
</b>ttUgly brute.  Shits and roars and
ttcomplains all day.
tttt(bypassing Almxe1sy and
approaching Madox)
ttOf course, you have your aeroplane.

ttexplorers?  I assume not.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>tttt(stiffly)
ttFenelon-Barnes.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttYes, I think a sailor can call himself an

The arrivals come inside.  Madox handles the introductions.

</b>ttI'm also searching for the lost Oasis, 
ttbut by more authentic means.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>tttt(of Almxe1sy)
ttAnyway, my friend here has a new theory -
ttthat Zerzura doesn't exist.  So we may all
ttbe chasing windmills.  Have some food.

<b>tttFENELON-BARNES
</b>ttWell, it's certainly not between here and
ttDakhla.  Nine days of nothing but sand
ttand sandstorms.  An egg.  I found an
ttostrich egg and some fossils.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttIsn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWhat kind of fossils?

<b>tttFENELON-BARNES
</b>ttI'll invite you to my paper at the

He takes a long drink from a bowl of frothing camel milk.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI think you know I am.

<b>tttFENELON-BARNES
</b>tttt(ignoring Almxe1sy)
ttQuite impossible, Madox.  You must know 
ttthat.  If you attempt to cross the Sand

<b>32tEXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    NIGHT.
</b>
tLATER, supper over, the company is entertaining itself.

Almxe1sy, standing outside his tent, watches the merriment from a 
distance.

D'Ag is nearing the end of a passionate rendition of  Puccini's E 
Lucevan Le Stelle.  He sits down to much applause from the others and 
SPINS AN EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE on the sand.  It comes to rest pointing 
at Clifton who gets up, grinning, and plunges into Yes! We Have No 
Bananas with great gusto.  His version involves CHANGING LANGUAGE 
during each line of the chorus - prompted by Oui!  or Ja!  or Si!  from 
the others.  Song finished, much bowing and guying, he spins the bottle 
and it arrives equidistant between Fenelon-Barnes and Katharine - until 
with a little NUDGE from the husband it settles on his wife.  Katharine 
gets up, awkward.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI can't sing.
tttt(the audience groans)
ttbut I can tell a story.
tttt(to Almxe1sy, who has arrived)
ttI might need a prompt.  Do you have your
ttHerodotus?  I've noticed you carry it...

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI'm sorry - what have you noticed?

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttYour book.  Your Herodotus!

Almxe1sy looks uncomfortable.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(reacting quickly)
ttIt doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can
ttmuddle through.  Okay - The Story of 
ttCandaules and Gyges.  King Candaules was
ttpassionately in love with his wife -
tttt(Geoffrey whistles proudly)
ttOne day he said to Gyges, the son of
ttsomebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(quietly prompting her)
ttDaskylus...

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(smiles)
ttYes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus -
ttCandaules said to him I don't think you
ttbelieve me when I tell you how beautiful
ttmy wife is.  And although Gyges replied he
ttdid find the Queen magnificent the King 
ttinsisted he would find some way to prove
ttbeyond dispute that she was fairest of
ttall women.  Do you all know this story?

The men all encourage her to continue her story.


<b>33*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.
</b>
- and Hana's voice CONTINUES THE STORY as she reads to the Patient who 
listens, eyes closed, still in the desert.

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(reading from the Herodotus)
ttI will hide you in the room where 
ttwe sleep, said Candaules.

She stumbles over the word.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttCandaules

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(not neurotic)
ttCandaules...you're laughing at me.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttI'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhen my wife comes to lie down she always
ttlays her garments one by one on a seat
ttnear the entrance of the room, and from
ttwhere you stand you will be able to gaze
tton her at your leisure...


<b>34*.tEXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    NIGHT.
</b>
<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(her story continuing)
ttAnd that evening, it's exactly as the
ttKing had told him, she goes to the chair
ttand removes her clothes, one by one, 
ttuntil she stand naked in full view of
ttGyges.  And indeed she was more lovely
ttthan he could have imagined.

Almxe1sy stares at her, framed by the velvet black sky.  Katharine turns 
to looks at him.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttBut then the Queen looked up and saw
ttGyges concealed in the shadows.   And
ttthough she said nothing, she shuddered.
ttThe next day she sent for Gyges and
ttchallenged him.  And hearing his story,
ttshe said this -

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttOff with his head!

<b>tttKATHERINE
</b><b>tt#NAME?
</b>ttdeath for gazing on that which you
ttshould not, or else kill my husband who
ttshamed me and become King in his place.

Clifton makes a face of outrage.  For Katherine the story has 
collapsed.  She wants it to be finished.

<b>tttKATHERINE
</b>ttSo Gyges killed the King and married
ttthe Queen and became ruler of Lydia
ttfor twenty eight years.  The End.
tttt(an uncomfortable moment)
ttDo I spin the bottle?

Almxe1sy shrinks away from the fire, disappears into black.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>tttt(to Clifton)
ttAnd let that be a lesson to you!


<b>35tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.
</b>
Hana looks up from the Herodotus, sees the Patient's eyes closed.  
Gently touches his face and whispers.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttAre you asleep?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>tttt(lying)
ttYes.  Dropping off.

And Hana closes the book, gets up, and blows out the lamp.  


<b>36tINT.   FENELON-BARNES TENT.   POTTERY HILL.   NIGHT.
</b>
PITCH BLACK and then A TORCH flickers on as Almxe1sy enters Fenelon-
Barnes' tent.  He pulls apart his luggage, quickly and methodically.  
He finds what he is looking for inside a trunk:  A LARGE FOSSILIZED 
BRANCH; a collection of stone leaves, wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin.  
Then he's distracted by a noise from Fenelon-Barnes' bed.  Almxe1sy 
stiffens, turns to investigate.  There's A LUMP in the cot.  A dog?  
Almxe1sy eases back the blanket to reveal a YOUNG GIRL, no more than 
fourteen, bound hand and foot.  He holds the torch to her face.


<b>37tEXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    MORNING.
</b>
The next morning.  Almxe1sy and Madox prepare to take off.  As they talk 
Clifton's Rupert Bear taxis past them, a wave from Clifton and 
Katharine.  Madox is very disturbed by what Almxe1sy is telling him.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttWhat did you think you were
ttdoing in his tent?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttLooking for the fossils.  Why should we
ttwait until we're in London?  This girl 
ttwas probably twelve years old.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>tttt(getting into the plane)
ttYou shouldn't go into another man's tent.
ttIt's inexcusable.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttHer hands and feet were tied.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttWhat did you do?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI looked at them.  They're shrubs,
ttsmall trees.  Exquisite.  And
ttfossilized, rock hard.

He walks away to the nose of the plane.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttI was talking about the girl.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttCut the ropes.  I left a note,
tton his blanket.
tttt(gleefully)
ttAt the next Geographical Society I 
ttshall await with great interest the
ttannouncement of the Fenelon-Barnes
ttSlave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, 
ttof course.  Her father had sold her
ttfor a camel.

He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.


<b>38tEXT.    GILF KEBIR PLATEAU.    MORNING.
</b>
Both planes are scouting the Gilf Kebir region.  Geoffrey flies up 
alongside Madox and wiggles his wings.  Madox waves.

They're flying over a distinctive group of GRANITE MASSIFS, Crater-
shaped hills.  The broken towers of the Gilf Kebir.  Almasy is 
distracted by them.  He turns to Madox and points down, indicating they 
should explore them.

Madox gestures to the Cliftons to PHOTOGRAPH the Massifs.  A THUMBS UP 
from Geoffrey.


<b>39*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.
</b>
Hana gives the Patient his injection, now she begins to change the 
sheet.  The light streams in from the open window.  She looks up at the 
green hills rolling away from the Monastery, the village in the 
distance.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI should try and move your bed.  I want
ttyou to be able to see the view.  It's
ttgood, it's a view from a monastery.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttI can already see.

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(bending down to his level)
ttHow?  How can you see anything?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttNot the window - I can't bear the light
ttanyway - no, I can see all the way to 
ttthe desert.  I've found the lost fossils.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI'm turning you.

An awkward moment as she rolls him on to his back.  He grunts with the 
pain.  She washes him very tenderly.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttZerzura, the White City of Acacias, the
ttOasis of Little Birds.  As me about the
ttscent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can
ttsmell it.  The taste of tea so black it
ttfalls into your mouth.  I can taste it.
ttI'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my
tteyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttNo sand.  That's your drugs speaking.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttI can see my wife in that view.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttAre you remembering more?

</b>ttWhy are you so determined to

</b>ttBecause I'm a nurse.


<b>40tEXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDENS.    NOON.
</b>
The TORTOISE heads towards the trough, to the gurgling accompaniment.  
It reaches the shade only to be greeted by the obstacle of some tennis 
shoes, a frock.  It clambers over as the water begins to belch out.  
Hana, naked, kneeling in the trough, receives the shower with a great 
YELP of shivering joy.


<b>41*.tEXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    NIGHT.
</b>
It's dark, but something is going on here.  Hana is caught by the stray 
shafts of moonlight.  She is SCRATCHING something on the flagstones.  
Her skirt is bunched up around her thighs.  She throws something in the 
air.  It's a SPILE, used to tap into the maple tree for syrup.  It 
lands with a crack.  Suddenly she is flying across the space, a hop, a 
skip, a jump.  Then turns at the other end, dips for the stone, then 
back again, in this blindman's version of HOPSCOTCH.


<b>42*.tINT.    TRAIN.    ITALY 1944.    BEFORE DAWN.
</b>
<b>AS HANA HOPS AND JUMPS IN THE SHADOWS SHE IS SUDDENLY ON A TRAIN IN

back to Naples.

Hana walks through a long carriage.  HER HAIR IS LONG.  She could be 
ten years younger than the Hana at the Monastery.  And easy.  She stops 
at the bunk of A NEW PATIENT.  Hana bends to the boy.  He's had 
shrapnel in his legs and cheek.  She speaks softly to him.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttHow are you?

<b>tttBOY
</b>ttOkay.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttYour leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel
ttcame out - I saved you the pieces.

ttI don't think so.

</b>ttNo, I'll get you some tea. Wait till

</b>tttt(innocent)
ttJust kiss me.  It would mean
ttsuch a lot to me.

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(tender, believing him)
ttWould it?

She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.

<b>tttBOY
</b>ttThank you.

He closes his eyes.  Is almost instantly asleep.  Hana smiles, 
continues along the compartment.  VOICES CALL OUT.

<b>ttt#1 INJURED MAN
</b>ttNurse - I can't sleep.

<b>ttt#2 INJURED MAN

away their joke)
ttVery funny.  Go to sleep.

She gets into a corridor.  Mary is coming the other way.  She carries a 
blood-soaked bundle.  Hana questions her appalled expression.

<b>tttMARY
</b>ttDon't ask.


<b>43tINT.    RAILWAY STATION.    DAY.

The train is arriving.  Hana hangs out of a window, scouring the crowds 
to find her sweetheart, STUART McGANN, a young Canadian Captain, who 
seeing her runs up to her window.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhere are we going?  I don't want to be
ttkissing in a crowd.  I have six hours.

She jumps out of the moving door and into his arms.

<b>tttSTUART
</b>tttt(laughing at her ferocity)
ttWhoa - give me a chance!

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttSorry.  I took a Benzedrine.

The Station is full of desperate people trying to make do.  the couple 
hurry through, oblivious to anyone except each other.

<b>tttSTUART
</b>ttI've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go
ttto Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.

<b>tttHANA

<b>tttSTUART
</b>ttWe can do that when we're very very old.


<b>44tINT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S ROOM.    NIGHT.
</b>
Hana lies alone in her bed covered by a curtain.  There's a sharp 
NOISE.  She's very frightened.  She has her pistol under her pillow and 
pulls it out, listens, holding her breath.  Another BANG.  She listens.


<b>45tEXT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S GARDEN.    DAY.
</b>
Hana has been reviving a vegetable patch.  She comes to garden.  CROWS 
are feasting.  She's furious, shouts, runs at them.  Nature, wildness, 
insisting on invading her peace.


<b>46*.tEXT.    THE MONASTERY.    GRAVEYARD.    MORNING.
</b>
Hana appears from the Cemetery, dragging A METAL CRUCIFIX.  It's bigger 
than she is, and she drags it, as if approaching Calvary.  A MAN 
WATCHER HER FROM A BICYCLE.  He's approaching fifty, grizzled and 
attractive, and could be Italian.  His hands are bandaged.  Hana aims 
the cross at the soil, but is not quite bit or strong enough.  The man, 
CARAVAGGIO, chooses this moment to introduce himself.  He drops the 
bicycle on the ground with a clatter.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>tttt(very cheerful)
ttBuon' Giorno!

Hana turns, startled and suspicious.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttAre you Hana?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhat do you want?

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttI met your friend Mary.  She said I
ttshould stop and see if you were okay.
ttApparently we're neighbors - my house
ttis two blocks from yours in Montreal.
ttCabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(unraveling this information)
ttBonjour.

He goes to her and - putting a bandaged hand behind her ear - PRODUCES 
AN EGG.  He beams, as does Hana.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttI'd like to take credit, but it's from
ttMary.  My name's David Caravaggio,
ttbut nobody ever called me David.
ttCaravaggio they find to absurd to
ttmiss out on.

During this he attempts the same thing with his other hand to Hana's 
other ear.  THE EGG DROPS TO THE GROUND.  Cursing, he gets on his knees 
and starts to scoop it up, preserving it.


<b>47*.tINT.    THE MONASTERY.    KITCHEN.    DAY.
</b>
Hana has taken his eggs and put them into a bowl.  She beats them with 
a knife picking out the bits of shell.  Caravaggio watches, takes in 
how little food there is otherwise.  The table seems useful more as a 
sewing area than for cooking - it's STREWN WITH ALTAR CLOTHS being sewn 
into drapes.  On a tray on the table are TWO PHIALS OF MORPHINE from 
the Patient's room.  As Hana turns to the stove, he's moved and covered 
them with his bandaged hands, a second later and he's juggled them into 
his pockets with the slightest clink.  Hana looks at him.  He shrugs, 
nods at the eggs.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttThey're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg

ttYou get chickens in Italy but no eggs.
ttIn Africa there were always eggs, but

</b>ttYeah, for a while.

ttNo.

ttHe might stay.

into tiny pieces)
ttThere's a war.  Where you come from

The Patient says nothing.  She puts a spoonful of the omelette into his 
mouth.  He grunts.

There is dancing inside, and couples walk to and from their tables.  
Katharine manages to produce a dazzling smile which includes everyone 
except Almxe1sy.

strips her own bed of the curtain she uses for a sheet.

moves around, then sits to make notes.

<b>tttOFFICER (O/S)

</b>ttNo.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found

walks up to the Patient's cabin.  He is propped up with a view of the 
sea, which is interrupted by the pacing Officer.  Hana has a blanket 
and a chart for the Patient's bed.  She busies herself.

formal, then edge round to the back of the bed.

<b>59*.tEXT.   THE MONASTERY.   HANA'S GARDEN.   MORNING.
</b>
A battered open backed TRUCK comes into the Monastery.  An ITALIAN 
PARTISAN sits in the back, a SHOTGUN resting on his knees.  The truck 
stops, and Caravaggio emerges from the passenger door.  He collects 
some packages from the PARTISAN, including a dead RABBIT, and then 
exchanges a few words with the driver.  Hana, who's watching all of 
this from her garden, sees that the driver is a WOMAN.  The woman's 
name is GIOIA, and Caravaggio leans into the window to make his goodbye 
to her.

Caravaggio approaches the Vegetable Garden as Hana comes to greet him.  
He throws her the rabbit, and hurries up the stairs without pausing, 
clutching the other boxes.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttSupper.

Hana calls after him.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhere've you been?

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>tttt(not stopping)
ttRabbit hunting.

Hana looks at the rabbit.  She's angry.  Caravaggio hasn't been around 
for a week.


<b>60*.tINT.  THE MONASTERY.  DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR.  DAY.

Hana heads up for the kitchen, then stops as there's a faint CRASH from 
upstairs.


<b>61*.tINT.   THE MONASTERY.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR.   DAY.
</b>
Hana, the rabbit still in her hands, comes along the corridor to find 
Caravaggio SLUMPED on the floor, retching.  The discarded NEEDLE lies 
beside him, the new package of MORPHINE CAPSULES ripped open.  He looks 
up at Hanna, glazed.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI could help you.  I could
ttget you off that.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttCan you cook the rabbit or will you
tttry and bring that back to life?

She bends, starts clearing up, putting the morphine phials back into 
the box.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttIt's a week.  We didn't know where you
ttwere - or if you coming back, or -

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>tttt(of the drugs)
ttYou should be happy.  What were you
ttgoing to do for him when it ran out?

He pulls out more phials from his jacket.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhat do you do?  What are you doing here?

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttSome gave me a dress.

ttYou know what's great?  What I'm learning?
ttYou win a war and you not only gain the

ttEverywhere I go, we're in the right.
ttI like that.


<b>62*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
</b>
Hana comes in, carrying a batch of the new morphine.  She's wearing a 
different FROCK.  It's not new, and it's faded, but the change of color 
is startling.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttSomething smells so rich.  My
ttstomach is heaving -

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttHe came back, he says he caught a
ttrabbit.  I'm cooking it.

<b>tttHANA

ttDo you know him?  Do you recognize him?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttDo I recognize him?  I recognize what he is.
ttI like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read

<b>63*.tEXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.
</b>
Almxe1sy squats with an ANCIENT ARAB outside his rudimentary house, while 
he draws on the sand, talking in some arcane dialect, scratching out a 
possible location for the lost oasis.  The man stops speaking and 
scours the sky a beat or two before we or Almasy hear the faint noise 
of a PLANE.  It's Clifton's Steerman, Rupert Bear, coming in to land.  
Almasy doesn't look up.

The Arab continues to talk.  The newly-arrived Katharine has scrambled 
up the hill to speak to Almxe1sy.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(diffident)
ttHello.  Not to interrupt but
ttwe're celebrating.

She makes to leave but Almxe1sy puts up a hand to keep Katharine there, 
but quiet.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttThis is an incredible story - about a man
tthunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me
ttabout Zerzura, he thinks he's been there,
ttbut his map, the route he's describing,
tthe couldn't survive the journey now, but
tthe's a poet, so his map is poetry - and
ttnow we're onto an Ostrich.
tttt(to the Arab in ARABIC)
ttI'm telling her your map is poetry.

The Arab shrugs.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttWhat do you mean, poetry?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttA mountain curved like a woman's back, 
tta plateau the shape of an ear.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttSounds perfectly clear.  Where does
ttthe Ostrich come in?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttThe Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts
ttan ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do
ttwith Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must
ttappear not to move.  The man finds a place
ttwhere the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands
ttwhere the ostrich can see him, on the
tthorizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat -
ttotherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall,
tthe moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the
ttostrich comes the next day, the man is
ttthere, but he's nearer.
tttt(to the guide)
ttHaunting the ostrich.

The Guide speaks, amplifying something, picking at his robe.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttYes, the ostrich, it will feed a family,
ttnot just the meat, but by selling the 
ttfeathers, beak, the skin, a year from
ttthis one animal.  So, each day the
ttman gets closer.  And the ostrich is
ttnot sure - has something changed? -
ttnow the standing man is only a few
ttyards from where it feeds.  And then
ttone day, the man is in the wadi, in
ttthe water.  And the Ostrich comes, as
ttalways, dips into the water and the
ttman JUMPS UP - and captures it.

He shrugs.  The Arab has more to say.  Almxe1sy doesn't respond, quieting 
him with a dismissive gesture.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttWhat is he saying?
tttt(Almasy, awkward, shakes his head)
ttCome on, what did he say?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttHe said - be careful.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttBe careful?  You mean you - or me?  Who?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(to the Arab)
ttHer or me?

The Arab speaks again.  Almasy speaks without looking at her.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttThe one who appears not to be moving.


<b>64*.tINT.    TENT.   BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.   NIGHT.

</b>ttYou too.  Good luck!

<b>tttALMxc1SY

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttVery well.

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>tttt(laughing it off)
ttWhy are you people so threatened 
ttby a woman?!

He settles into the controls.  Almxe1sy watches the plane taxi away.  
Doesn't move at all.  Katharine waves from the tent as the Steerman 
takes off.


65a*.tEXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.

The THREE FORD CARS leave the campsite, loaded for a scouting 
expedition.  The rest of the party, Bedouin, tents, camels and Tiger 
Moth is left behind.  Madox shouts last-minute instructions from the 
window of his car.


<b>66*.tEXT.    DESERT EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

FENELON-BARNES sits astride his camel, and wipes away the sweat.  The 
desert stretches for miles, shimmering, the sun baking the sand.  His 
GUIDES wind their headcloths tighter.  Nobody speaks.  Then one of them 
looks round, raises a hand.  A BUZZING noise.  They all turn.  A SMALL 
CLOUD OF DUST EMERGES OVER A RIDGE.  Locusts?  A sandstorm?

A CARAVAN OF CARS, the Almxe1sy/Madox expedition, bumps along, 
suspensions threatened by the constant dips and ridges.  On each car 
there are three in the passenger cabin, the open backs crammed with 
drums of gasoline and water and equipment.  On the front vehicle, the 
tenth member of the party, KAMAL, acts as a navigator and sits on a 
CAMEL SADDLE, a rodeo cowboy, on the roof of the leading car, driven by 
Madox.  As they spot FENELON-BARNES they sound their horns and wave 
good-naturedly.  F-B scowls, watches them roar by, stealing his 
thunder.

ONE OF THE CARS IS HOPELESSLY BOGGED DOWN IN HEAVY SAND.  It's contents 
have been unloaded, and a rope ladder is being inserted under the

of extricating the vehicle.


<b>67*.tINT.    CAR EN ROUTE TO CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Auf.  Katharine breaks the long silence.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI've been thinking about - how does

ttwhatever you're doing - in your castle,
ttor wherever it is you live, and one day,
ttyou say, I have to go to the desert - or what?

Almxe1sy doesn't answer.  Katharine, who has looked at him for an answer, 
looks away.  There's another long silence.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI once traveled with a terrific guide,
ttwho was taking me to Faya.  He didn't
ttspeak for nine hours.  At the end of

Point made, they lapse again into silence.  Katharine boils.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttActually, you sing.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttPardon?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttYou sing.  All the time.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI do not.

<b>tttKATHARINE

Almxe1sy asks Al Auf in Arabic.  He laughs, nods.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(sings wickedly)
ttI'll be down to get you in the taxi,
tthoney, you'd better be ready about
tthalf-past eight...!

Al Auf nods and grins furiously, joins in, impersonating Almxe1sy.  
Almxe1sy grunts in irritation.


<b>68*.tEXT.  NEAR THE BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.  DUSK.

The group is investigating a cleft in the rocky massif.  They climb 
slowly.  Below them, A NEW AND TEMPORARY BASE CAMP.

The group winds around the rock.  Almxe1sy turns to offer a hand to 
Katharine behind him, pulling her up to the next rock slab.  She smiles 
at him.  He smiles back curtly, continues.

The group stops at a level plateau.  The Arabs stand apart and SING 
THEIR PRAYERS AT DUSK.  Al Auf leads the incantations.

<b>tttAL AUF
</b>ttAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar...

The westerners wait respectfully.  As the sun sets in glory, Almxe1sy 
looks over at the range of rocks.  One particular range seems to look 
exactly like A WOMAN'S BACK.  He squints at the rock.  Almxe1sy 
discreetly pulls out his COMPASS.


<b>69*.tEXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DUSK.
</b>
Almxe1sy clambers up the rocks, coming through a narrow crevice to find A 
NATURAL SHELF.  He scrambles up this path, reaching up, only to notice 
that his hand almost perfectly covers A PAINTED HAND on the rock, and 
as he digests this he realizes he has climbed past what is THE MOUTH OF 
A CAVE.  He disappears inside.


<b>70tINT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.
</b>
A FLASHLIGHT squirts into the cave.  Almxe1sy treads cautiously along the 
narrow winding passage.  He comes to an open cavern and takes his 
flashlight up to a wall.  PAINTINGS EMERGE, figures, animals,  ancient 
pictures.  A giraffe.  Cattle.  Fish.  Men with bows and arrows.  
Almxe1sy is astonished by what he sees.


<b>71*.tEXT.    NEAR THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    EVENING.
</b>
The others watch as a flashlight bobs and jerks among the rocks as 
Almxe1sy comes scrambling down, transformed into an excited teenager.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttMadox!  Madox!

He slithers in a heap in front of the astonished expedition party.  
Doesn't care.


<b>72tINT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.
</b>
Almxe1sy has led the whole party into the heart of the cave.  Now Madox 
comes alongside him at the wall, his flashlight joining Almxe1sy's and 
increasing the visibility of the paintings.  A dark-skinned figure, 
apparently in the process of DIVING into water, comes clearly into 
view.  Then others supine, arms outstretched.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>tttt(with audible excitement)
ttMy God, they're swimming!

The others crowd round.  FIVE EXCITED FACES IN THE GREEN GLOOM OF THE 
<b>CAVE.
</b>

<b>73*.tEXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.
</b>
A hive of activity.  The team has set up TRESTLES to catalogue the 
finds as the Bedouin come out with baskets of detritus, which they 
empty onto a growing heap as the Cave is cleared out.  Entering the 
cave, Almxe1sy passes with camera equipment, just as D'Ag emerges 
carrying the corpse of a perfectly preserved DESERT FOX.  D'Ag gestures 
to Almasy with his customary enthusiasm, holding up the body of the 
fox.

<b>tttD'AGOSTINO
</b>ttHave you seen this?  Astonishing.
ttPerfectly preserved.


<b>74tINT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.
</b>
Inside, Bermann is setting up LAMPS, running wires from a car BATTERY.  
Kamal is helping him.  And as Almxe1sy arrives he catches a tiny moment 
of tenderness between them.  Bermann, seeing him, quickly disengages 
and busies himself with the lights.  At another wall, Katharine is 
catching.


<b>75tEXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.
</b>
The CARS are heading back to Basecamp.  They bounce over the sand.


<b>76*.tINT.    BERMANN'S CAR.    DAY.
</b>
Bermann is driving the lead CAR along some STEEP DUNES.  Almxe1sy beside 
him.  Bermann is peeling AN ORANGE, a segment of which he holds out of 
the window.  Kamal, riding shotgun, leans down and collects it, his 
head dipping in to grin at Bermann.  Bermann looks uneasily as Almxe1sy.  
He wants to tell him of his passion, of his absolute love for Kamal, 
but he daren't.

<b>tttBERMANN
</b>ttI love the desert, you see.  That's my,
ttthat's my - I can't think of the word.
tttt(Almxe1sy nods)
ttHow do you explain?  To someone who's
ttnever been here?  Feelings which seem
ttquite normal.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(compassionate)
ttI don't know, my friend.  I don't know.

Bermann holds out another segment of the orange, and watches the slim 
brown hand collect it.  A MOMENTARY DISTRACTION IS ALL IT TAKES FOR HIM 
<b>TO MISJUDGE THE LINE AND SUDDENLY THE DUNE COLLAPSES UNDER THE TIRE AND 
</b>THE CAR LURCHES SIDEWAYS AND TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE.  D'Ag - following, 
Fouad beside him - brakes sharply, but can't stop his own car from 
being caught in the avalanche of sand, and IT PLUNGES DOWN THE DUNE AND 
INTO BERMANN'S UPTURNED CAR WITH AN OMINOUS CRUNCH, the radiator 
exploding.  Only Madox, Katharine beside him, and a little way behind, 
manages to stay clear of the trouble.  He jumps out of the vehicle and 
slides down the dune to find pandemonium as the passengers stumble out 
of the cars, sand flying, smoke pouring from the upright vehicle, the 
wheels of the overturned car spinning wildly in the air, a puddle of 
oil spreading ominously.


<b>77*.tEXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>LATER and the group have cleaned up as best as possible.  D'Ag, 
Bermann, and Fouad are a little worse for wear.  Fouad's arm is in a 
sling, and D'Ag is sporting a bloody head-bandage.  Bermann has broken 
a finger and is being attended to by Madox.  The luggage, water and 
petrol have been stacked up and the men are loading up the remaining 
car.  Almxe1sy is working at the crumpled end of the vehicle.  He's 
having no success.


<b>78*.tEXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy, Kamal and two of the other young Bedouin stand around the mess 
of the two broken vehicles.  The ONE WORKING CAR is loaded with men and 
provisions.  Katharine sits inside, next to Madox, Almxe1sy comes over to 
her window, to speak past her to Madox.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttI'll be back as quick as I can.  
ttThirty-six hours at the outside.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttTry to get a second radiator, we'll bury
ttit between here and the Pottery Hill.
ttAnd a better jack.  We planned badly.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>tttt(nods at Almxe1sy, then shouts over 
to the wrecked vehicles)
ttBermann!

This is Bermann's cue to take leave of Kamal who is staying behind.  
Kamal makes a little bow.

<b>tttKAMAL
</b>ttMay God make safety your companion.

Bermann nods and hurries away, squeezing into the car which jolts off, 
bouncing over the track.

<b>THE VEHICLE GETS ABOUT TWENTY YARDS, ALMASY WATCHING, BEFORE IT SINKS 
</b><b>FORLORNLY INTO THE SOFT SAND.  IT'S HOPELESSLY OVERLOADED WITH PEOPLE.  
</b><b>THEY ALL GET OUT.
</b>
<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI shall stay behind, of course

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttCertainly not.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI insist.  There clearly isn't room for
ttus all, I'm the least able to dig, and 
ttI'm not one of the walking wounded.
ttThose are facts.  Besides, if I remain
ttit's the most effective method of
ttpersuading my husband to abandon
ttwhatever he's doing and rescue us.

It's hard to argue with this logic.  Almxe1sy shrugs.

LATER - THE MADOX CAR makes a more effective departure.  And Almasy and 
Katharine are left alone.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER as if realizing this 
for the first time.  Almasy immediately returns to the two damaged 
vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent 
TO FASHION A MAKESHIFT SHELTER BETWEEN THE TWO CARS.  Katharine goes to 
join them.  There is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles 
of undulating dunes.


<b>79tINT.    SHELTER.    DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy sits alone, writing into HIS HERODOTUS, a map folded in front of 
him, from which he makes notes.  Katherine comes across with a clutch 
of her SKETCHES from the Cave wall.  Hands them to him.  They're 
beautiful.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWhat's this?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI thought you might paste them
ttinto your book.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWe took several photographs,
ttthere's no need.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI'd like you to have them.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(handing them back)
ttThere's really no need.  This is
ttjust a scrapbook.  I should feel
ttobliged.  Thank you.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(exasperated)
ttAnd that would be unconscionable,
ttI suppose, to feel any obligation?  
ttYes.  Of course it would.

She's already turning, walking as far from him as the cramped shelter 
permits.  He continues with his maps.


<b>80tEXT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.
</b>
Katharine sits alone on top of the Dune, smoking, surveying the 
landscape.  Below her the makeshift camp - a fresh wind flicking at the 
tarpaulin, THE DEEP TRACKS OF MADOX'S CAR STRETCHING OFF TOWARDS 
CIVILIZATION.  Almxe1sy emerges from the tent and, locating Katharine, 
heads towards her.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttYou should come into the shelter.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI'm quite all right, thank you.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttLook over there.

Katharine turns, scans the horizon.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttWhat am I looking at?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttSee what's happening to them -
ttthe stars.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttThey're so untidy.  I'm just trying 
ttto rearrange them.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttIn an hour there will be no stars.
ttThe air is filling with sand.

He offers a hand.  A little reluctantly she takes it.


<b>81tEXT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.
</b>
The team hurries around the improvised tent, weighing it down with 
packing cases, gasoline drums, water cans, bringing anything loose or 
light inside the tarpaulin.  THE WIND is whipping up, the air busy with 
sand.  Almxe1sy pushes everyone under cover.


<b>82tINT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.
</b>
THE SAND SEEMS TO BE SCOURING THE TARPAULIN.  Kamal and Almxe1sy try to 
secure one vulnerable area, but suddenly there are leaks everywhere and 
the sand swarms inside.

It's noisy, too, and Almxe1sy has to shout to make himself understood, 
indicating to the Bedouin to grab water and blankets and food, all the 
valuables, and get out.  He himself finds blankets and water and shouts 
at Katharine to do the same.  One side of the canvas suddenly RIPS 
apart like paper. Chaos as figures struggle in ever-worsening 
conditions, sand blizzarding the air.


<b>83tEXT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.
</b>
THE SHELTER FLIES INTO THE AIR, stranding the figures, their heads 
wrapped in blankets, flashlights useless.  They seek safety in two 
groups, the tribesmen to the cabin of the overturned car, Katharine and 
Almxe1sy to the upright one.


<b>84tINT.    CAR.    NIGHT.
</b>
Inside the cabin, the sand swirling around them, Katharine and Almxe1sy 
sit without speaking.  Dawn is trying to break through.  He pours a 
little water into a mug so that they can wash out their eyes and noses 
and mouths.  She takes her silk scarf and first dries her eyes with it, 
then dries his.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttThis is not very good, is it?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttNo.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttShall we be all right?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttYes.  Absolutely.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttYes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.


<b>85tEXT.    THE DESERT.    DAWN.
</b>
The sand is piling up against the two cars, the tent is swept from its 
moorings, the water cans are hurled up too, and then plunge ominously 
into sand drifts as if going under an ocean.

<b>tttALMxc1SY (O/S)
</b>tt...let me tell you about winds.  There
ttis a whirlwind in Southern Morocco, the 
ttAajej, against which the fellahin defend
ttthemselves with knives.  The Ghibli from
ttTunis rolls and rolls and produces a 
ttrather strange nervous condition...

And we hear Katharine's laugh.


<b>86tINT.    CAR.    DAWN.
</b>
Almasy sits alongside Katharine, whose head is against his shoulder.  
He continues his story of winds.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b><b>tt#NAME?
</b>ttWhich Mariners called the sea of
ttdarkness.  Red sand from this wind
tthas flown as far as the south coast
ttof England, producing showers so
ttdense they were mistaken for blood.

Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttFiction.  We had a house on that coast
ttand it never rained blood.  Go on.  More.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttAll true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells
ttof a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a
ttnation declared war on it and marched
ttout to fight it in full battle dress, 
tttheir swords raised.


<b>87*.tEXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.
</b>
MORNING.  The sand has almost COMPLETELY ENGULFED the car on the 
exposed side, covering the windshield like snow, and encroaching onto 
the door of the protected flank.


<b>88*.tINT.    CAR.    DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy is woken by sound of A DISTANT ENGINE.  He jerks up, waking 
Katharine in the process, and heaves against the door.  He can't open 
it, and has to lean his feet against the passenger door, lying across 
Katharine, kicking it open.


<b>89*.tEXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.
</b>
By the time Almxe1sy emerges from the car, the sand pouring into the 
cabin, MADOX'S CAR IS ROARING ALONG THE HORIZON.  Almxe1sy waves, shouts, 
and then runs back into the car, finds his flare-gun, and SENDS A FLARE 
high into the sky.  Katharine is with him now, and they watch, 
helplessly, as the car bounces away from them, Madox a man on a 
mission.  Katharine panics, THE SAND HAS ERASED ALL TRACES OF THEM.  
She speaks quietly, shocked.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttOur tracks, where are they?

Almxe1sy is preoccupied.  He's gone back to their vehicle and returns 
with a shovel, STARTS TO DIG FRANTICALLY.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttMadox will have calculated how many
ttmiles, they'll soon turn around.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(realizing what he's doing)
ttOh my God, the others!

She kneels with him and helps to shovel away the sand WHICH HAS 
COMPLETELY ENGULFED THE OTHER VEHICLE containing the three Bedouin.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(during this)
ttCould I ask you, please, to paste you
ttpaintings into my book?  I should like
ttto have them.  I should be honored.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttOf course.  Is it, am I a terrible
ttcoward to ask how much water we have?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(shoveling hard)
ttWater?  Yes, we have water, we have
tta little in our can, we have water in
ttthe radiator which can be drunk.  Not
ttat all cowardly, extremely practical.
tttt(anxious at not uncovering
the boys, egging himself on)
ttCome on, come on!
tttt(then back to Katharine)
ttThere's also a plant - I've never seen
ttit but I'm told you can cut a piece the
ttsize of a heart from this plant and
ttthe next day it will be filled with a
ttdelicious liquid.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttFind that plant.  Cut out its heart.

They hear NOISES, scrabbling, faint thumps.  Almxe1sy scrapes at the sand 
and they find the glass of the car.  The angle of the cab, tilted up to 
the sky, has made it impossible for the trapped boys to lever it open.  
Their oxygen is rapidly deteriorating.  Almxe1sy pulls the door and it 
cranks open.


<b>90*.tEXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.
</b>
Katharine sits in the car, putting her pictures into the Herodotus.  
It's full of ALMxc1SY'S HANDWRITING, PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME PRESSED FLOWERS.  
She deciphers a page of his words and drawings.  It's almost 
exclusively about her, the lines studded with K.s.  She reads, 
astonished, then looks at him as he and two of the three Bedouin circle 
the area of the cars in ever-widening circles, like water-diviners, 
like Kip searches for mines.  Kamal is slumped against the front of the 
car.  He's sick.  Almxe1sy suddenly drops to his knees and begins to 
shovel into the sand.  He pulls out A CAN OF WATER.  Turns to Katharine 
and holds it triumphantly in the air.


<b>91*.tINT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.
</b>
There's a small, weak fire.  The group crouch around it.  The boys talk 
noisily to Almxe1sy.  Kamal is wrapped in a blanket and shivering.  
Almxe1sy gives him water, speaks to Katherine.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttKamal is passing blood.  He must have
tthad some internal damage in the crash.
ttHe needs medicine.  I think we must risk
ttthe other flare.

He gets up and loads the flare with what is clearly the last charge.  
This time the effect is dramatic with A RED UMBRELLA OF LIGHT.  
Katharine comes up beside him.  They wait, hope fading with the flare.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(blank)
ttGeoffrey's not in Cairo.
tttt(Almxe1sy looks at her)
ttHe's not actually a buffoon.  And
ttthe plane wasn't a wedding
ttpresent.  It belongs to the British
ttGovernment.  They want aerial
ttmaps of the whole North Africa.
ttSo I think he's in Ethiopia.  In
ttcase you were counting on his 
ttsudden appearance.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttAnd the marriage - is that a fiction?

There's a beat.  Katharine has a hundred answers.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttNo, the marriage isn't a fiction.

The light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the dark.  
Suddenly on the far horizon, behind their heads, AN ANSWERING FLARE 
fireworks into the sky.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttThank God.  Oh, thank God.

There's excited shouting from the two fit boys.  They leap up and run 
towards the couple, who meanwhile have realized that the flare has not 
come from Madox, but from an approaching CAMEL CARAVAN.  Almxe1sy shouts 
to the boys for some identification.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttDo they know them?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(squinting at the horizon)
ttNo, but I think I do.

The Caravan slowly comes into focus.  IT'S FENELON-BARNES.  Katharine 
touches Almxe1sy's arm - an almost imperceptible gesture.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttAm I K. in your book?  
ttI think I must be.

Almxe1sy turns to her.  He runs the blade of his arm across her neck - 
the sweat leaving a clear stripe.

Fenelon-Barnes approaches, dismounts from his camel, and addresses 
Almxe1sy.

<b>tttFENELON-BARNES
</b>ttI recollect your saying to ignore
ttyour bones but I assume you have
ttno objection to my rescuing your

tttt(to Katharine)
ttGood evening, Mrs. Clifton.

<b>tttKATHARINE

ttHello.

<b>tttFENELON-BARNES
</b>ttI'd like to introduce you to my camel -
ttthe most notable beast on earth.
tttt(to Almxe1sy)
ttI understand you found some

A goatskin bag of water is offered to Katharine.  She drinks and hands 
it to Almxe1sy.

<b>tttFENELON-BARNES
</b>ttPaintings of swimmers?  Remarkable.


<b>92tEXT.    CAIRO.    DAY.

ANOTHER WORLD as a honking TAXI containing Almxe1sy and Katharine 
negotiates the incredible bustle of Cairo.


<b>93tEXT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy, still in the same clothes, and evidently weary, emerges from 
the cab, and pulls Katharine's belongings from the trunk, then holds 
open the door for her.  As she walks towards the hotel, he hands her 
bag to a porter.  Katharine is stung.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttWill you not come in?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttNo.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttWill you please come in?

ttMrs. Clifton -

tKatharine turns, disgusted.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttDon't.  

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI believe you still have my book.

Katharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him, then 
disappears.


<b>94tINT.    ALMxc1SY'S ROOM.    DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy lying on a camp bed, face down.  The walls are covered with 
maps, enlargements of photographs.  A fan whirs over his kit which is 
spread, unraveled but ordered, on the stone floor.  An ineffably male 
room, the shutters closed, just the thinnest shaft of light piercing 
the gloom.  Almxe1sy hasn't even removed his clothes, his boots kicked 
off below his jutting feet.  

There's A KNOCK at the door.  Almxe1sy sleeps.  Another.  A third.  He's 
roused from the dead.  Stumbles to his feet, opens the door as the 
knocking continues.

It's Katharine.  She's bathed, luminous, stands back-lit by the 
afternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress.  She walks past him into 
the room.  He closes the door.  She turns.  He KNEELS before her, head 
at her thighs.  She's crying, her face expressionless as her hands go 
to his head.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttYou still have sand in your hair.

She starts to BEAT on his head and shoulders, violently.  He pulls 
back, to look at her, the tears streaming down her face.  She kneels 
and covers his face with kisses.  He pulls blindly at her dress and it 
RIPS across her breasts.


<b>95*.tINT.    BATHROOM.    DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy is in the bath.  Katharine, wearing his dressing gown, pours in 
a jug of steaming water.  Almxe1sy leans over the rim of the bath.  He's 
sewing, carefully repairing the torn dress.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI'm impressed you can sew.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttGood.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttYou sew very badly.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttYou don't sew at all!

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttA woman should never learn to sew,
ttand if she can she should never
ttadmit to it.  Close your eyes.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(laughs)
ttThat makes it harder still.

She pushes the sewing from his hands, then pours water over his head, 
then begins to shampoo his hair.

Almxe1sy is in heaven.  The biggest smile we have seen from him.  She 
continues to massage his scalp.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWhen were you most happy?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttNow.

<b>tttALMxc1SY

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttWhat do I love?  I love rice pudding,
ttand water, the fish in it, hedgehogs!
ttThe gardens at our house in Freshwater -
ttall my secret paths.

She rinses his scalp, then slips off the robe and CLIMBS IN BESIDE HIM, 
covering his neck and shoulders in kisses.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWhat else?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttMarmite - addicted!  Baths - not

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttA lie.  What do you hate most?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttOwnership.  Being owned.  When
ttyou leave, you should forget me.

She freezes, pulls herself away, out of the bath, looks at him, then 
SLAPS HIM VERY HARD across the face.

She picks up her dress, the thread and needle dangling from it, and 
walks, dripping, out of the room.


<b>96*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

To the Patient it's as if Katharine is walking out of his wall.  He 
sighs with pain, then looks away to where Hana has fallen asleep on the 
bed, almost on top of him.  He touches her.   He speaks as if each word 
burns him.

begins to pour the water to cool herself against the night's pressing 
heat.

The EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL is a cluster of tents practically ahead of

Italy is still intense.

exhausted, on their cots.  The mud is everywhere.  Another nurse is 
making tea out of an adapted plasma can on their tiny primus.

couple of beds, shares a word or two with the patients.  She stops at 
another bed, leans over its occupant.  His bandaged face is bloated and 
yellow.  He's not breathing.  She bends over him, his open eyes fixed 
in a glassy stare.  No pulse.  She snaps the triangular cardboard ID 
from his bed to indicate HE'S DIED.  Then tenderly closes his eyes.  
<b>THEY SUDDENLY SNAP OPEN.  HE REARS UP, GRABBING HER.
</b>
<b>tttWOUNDED SOLDIER
</b>ttCan't wait to have me dead?  You bitch!

He slaps her hand away.  Slaps at the tubes going into his arm.  Hana 
is absolutely shocked.  But just as suddenly he's sunk back into semi-
consciousness.

Shaken, she sits by him and takes his hand, he pulls it away, she takes 
it again.  He is in terrible pain.  His face creased with anger.  Now 
his hand is clutching at hers.  She tries to soothe him.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttTry t be calm.  Ssssshhh.  Come on.
ttBe calm now.  Ssshhhh.  Be peaceful.
ttIt's okay.  It's okay.

HIS FACE STILLS.  HIS HAND LOOSENS.  Now he has gone.  As Hana inspects 
him, a shell seems to land close by.  THE LIGHTS FLICKER.  She ducks, 
along with everyone else.

Below the bed, on slatboards, above the mud, are the now dead soldier's 
possessions.  They include A PAIR OF TENNIS SHOES.


<b>101tINT.  TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.  EVENING.
</b>
HANA, WEARING THE TENNIS SHOES, IS GIVING BLOOD.  She lies in a cot, 
next to JAN.  The shelling sounds closer.

OLIVER, the Doctor, is working on the most recent patient, a young 
CANADIAN Boy who is critically ill - the tubes hanging above him, of 
plasma and of blood.  The curtain drawn around him is pulled back, to 
reveal the two nurses in the background.  The Soldier can just see 
them.  He's going to die any minute.  

<b>tttCANADIAN SOLDIER
</b>tttt(whispering to Oliver)
ttIs there anybody here from Picton?

<b>tttOLIVER
</b>ttPicton?  I don't know.

<b>tttCANADIAN SOLDIER
</b>ttI'd like to see somebody from home
ttbefore I go.

Hana can only really hear Oliver's end of this conversation, but the 
mention of Canada chills her, and she knows, now, not later, that 
Stuart is dead.

<b>tttHANA 
</b>tttt(to Oliver)
ttWhy Picton?

<b>tttOLIVER
</b>ttHe's from there - edge of Lake
ttOntario right, Soldier?

The boy nods.

<b>tttJAN 
</b>tttt(innocent)
ttWhere's your Stuart from?
ttSomewhere near there, isn't it?

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(to Oliver)
ttAs him what company he's with?

Oliver leans over, then turns to Hana.

<b>tttOLIVER
</b>ttThird Canadian Fusiliers.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttDoes he know a Captain McGann?

The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.

<b>tttCANADIAN SOLDIER
</b>ttHe bought it.  Yesterday.  Shot to bits.

The shells are getting closer.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhat did he say?

<b>tttOLIVER
</b>tttt(can't look at her)
ttDoesn't know him.

<b>A SHELL SUDDENLY LANDS ON TOP OF THE SITE, PERHAPS FIFTY YARDS FROM THE 
</b><b>TENT.  THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  THEN ANOTHER LANDS.
</b>
Everybody is on the floor, struggling to get on a helmet.

Hana lies down, the blood still leaving her, her helmet on.  Oliver is 
next to her in the mud.  Her heart is breaking.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttHe's gone, hasn't he?

<b>tttOLIVER
</b>ttNo.  He's - no.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttOh God.  Oh God.

The shells pound them, incredibly loud, drowning out her grief, but 
each explosion illuminates it for a moment.


<b>102tINT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.
</b>
Caravaggio comes into the kitchen.  Hana is slumped at the table, her 
back naked.  The jug of water in front of her.  She's sobbing, her 
shoulders heaving.  Caravaggio approaches tentatively.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttHana?
tttt(he touches her shoulder)
ttHana?  Are you alright?

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(without raising her head)
ttDon't touch me if you're going to

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>tttt(soothing)
ttI'll have some of your water.  It's hot.

She reaches for her blouse, wraps it around herself.  Her face is read 
with weeping.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>tttt(gently)
ttYou have to protect yourself from 
ttsadness.  This is the thing I've learned.
tttt(drinking the water)
ttYou're in love with him, aren't you?
ttYour patient.  Do you think he's a saint
ttor something?  Because of the way he 
ttlooks?  I don't think he is.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI'm not in love with him.  I'm in love
ttwith ghosts.  And so is he.  He's in

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(stung)
ttWhat?  How could he have?  When?

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttI'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI don't know what that means.

Hana sits reading from the Herodotus.  She shows the Patient the page 
where a CHRISTMAS CRACKER WRAPPER covered in handwriting has been glued 
in.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttTell me about this, this is in your

</b>ttK is for Katharine.


<b>104tEXT.  AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, DECEMBER 1938.  DAY.
</b>
A CHRISTMAS PARTY FOR THE TROOPS.  The incongruous attempts to create a 
traditional Christmas in the dusty heat of Cairo.  

The Party is in the courtyard of the Moorish Palace which serves as the 
private residence of the British Ambassador, SIR RONNIE HAMPTON.  Lots 
of Wives, including LADY HAMPTON and Katharine help serve tea and cake 
to the SOLDIERS who sit at rudimentary tables with paper plates and 
paper hats.  A man dressed as SANTA CLAUS is giving out presents - 
PENGUIN PAPERBACKS, CHOCOLATE.  Music blares out from a loudspeaker.  
Officers and Civilians walk the parameter.  One of these, arriving, is 
Almasy.  He sits in the shade, catches Katharine's attention.  
Katharine brings him over a cup of tea and a plate with Christmas cake 
on it.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttSay you're sick.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttWhat?  No!

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttSay you're feeling faint - the sun.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(but a frisson)
ttNo.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI can't work.  I can't sleep.

Lady Hampton calls impatiently.

<b>tttLADY HAMPTON
</b>ttKatharine!

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttComing.
tttt(to Almxe1sy)
ttI can't sleep.  I woke up shouting
ttin the middle of the night.  Geoffrey
ttthinks it's the thing in the desert,
ttthe trauma.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI can still taste you.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(waving at another woman who
pushes a trolley with teapots)
ttThis is empty, just coming!

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI'm trying to write with your taste
ttin my mouth.
tttt(as she leaves)
ttSwoon.  I'll catch you.

Almxe1sy sits watching the party.  The Santa Claus is dragged outside by 
some excited Children.  Almxe1sy picks at his cake removing the thick 
marzipan icing.  He's writing on A CHRISTMAS CRACKER WRAPPER, smoothing 
it out - December 22nd.  Betrayals in war are childlike compared with 
out betrayals du...

Katharine, attending to a raucous table, suddenly sags at the knees, 
and SWOONS.  People rush to her.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI'm fine.  How silly.

<b>tttOFFICER'S WIFE
</b>tttt(helping her to her feet)
ttIt's the heat.

<b>tttLADY HAMPTON
</b>ttYou should sit down, darling.
tttt(to the others)
ttShe's quite all right.

ttAre you pregnant?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI don't think so.

<b>tttLADY HAMPTON
</b>tttt(squeezing her arm)
ttHow romantic.  With Fiona I fell

<b>tttLADY HAMPTON
</b>ttI'll come with you.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttNo, please.  I shall be absolutely fine.

They pass Almxe1sy, who doesn't look up from his book.


<b>105tINT.  STORE ROOM.  AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.  DAY.
</b>
A small STOREROOM inside the Palace - Brooms, Mops, Cleaning Equipment.  
Outside, the party is visible as opaque shadows through the beveled 
glass of the ornate window.  The sound of carols sung by the enlisted 
men gives way to a version of SILENT NIGHT played on a solitary 
bagpipe.  Inside, ALMxc1SY AND KATHARINE MAKE LOVE IN THE DARKNESS.  
Everything is too fast, desperate, standing up, grabbing, hoisting 
clothes.


<b>106tINT.    CORRIDORS.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    DAY.
</b>
A CORRIDOR.  Almxe1sy appears and almost immediately collides with the 
man dressed as SANTA CLAUS.  He moves to one side.  

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttHave you seen Katharine?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(taken aback)
ttWhat?

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttIt's Geoffrey under this.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI haven't, no.  Sorry.


106a*.tINT.    SIDE ROOM IN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    DAY.

Geoffrey continues scouting the warren of tiny rooms that run off the 
central courtyard.  He finds Katharine sitting in one, smoking, 
surrounded by oppressive and elaborate tiling.  Clifton wonders briefly 
how Almxe1sy had missed Katharine.

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttDarling, I just heard.  You poor
ttsausage, are you all right?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI'm fine.  I got hot.

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttLady H said she thought you might be -

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttRight.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttAren't you?

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttSweltering.
tttt(taking off his hat and beard)
ttCome on, I'll take you home.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttCan't we really go home?  I can't breathe.
ttAren't you dying for green, anything
ttgreen, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel
ttrain on your face?  It's Christmas and

ttI'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttSweetheart, you know we can't go

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(poking at his costume)
ttGeoffrey, you do so love putting

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttI do so love you.
tttt(he kisses her head)
ttWhat do you smell of?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttMarzipan!  I think you've got marzipan
ttin your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.


<b>107*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.
</b>
The Patient lies alone in his room.  CLIFTON'S FACE stares back at him 
from among the frescoes.  Then something distracts him.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttAre you outside?

A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttI can't hide anymore.
tttt(jerks up his hands)
ttI breathe like a dog.  I lose my
ttbalance.  Stealing's got harder.

Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttWhy do I feel if I had your book I
ttwould know everything?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttI don't even know if it is my book.
ttThe Bedouin found it in the plane,
ttin the wreckage.  It's mine now.  
ttI heard your breathing and thought
ttit might be rain.  I'm dying for rain -
ttof course I'm dying anyway - but I
ttlong to feel rain on my face.

Caravaggio comes close, scrutinizing the face, trying to repair the 
features.  Exasperated.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttIs it you?  If I said Moose... I look
ttdifferent, fuck, why shouldn't you?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>tttt(impassive)
ttMoose.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>tttt(a different tack)
ttFirst wedding anniversary - what
ttdo you call it?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttI don't know.  Paper.  Is it?  Paper?
tttt(sharp, not wanting to think)
ttI don't remember.


<b>108tINT.    MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.
</b>
Hana stands at the PIANO.  It's still lop-sided, propped against the 
wall.  She tries but can't move it.  So she pulls off the dust-sheet 
and, with the instrument still on a tilt, begins to play the Aria from 
Bach's Goldberg Variations.


<b>109tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
</b>
HANA'S PIANO CONTINUES.  Upstairs, Caravaggio chats with the Patient 
while working his arms to RAISE A VEIN, a boot-lace tied around it, 
preparing an injection for himself, tapping the syringe.  During this:

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttI have come to love that little tap of
ttthe fingernail against the syringe.  Tap.


<b>110*.tINT.    MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.
</b>
Hana plays.  GUN SHOTS punctuates the music.  She's totally engrossed 
and only hears the second or third shot.  Her hands falter, she looks 
up to see A SIKH SOLDIER RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD WAVING HIS ARMS, his 
REVOLVER held aloft.  He approaches the door, his face creased with 
anxiety, and raps on the shattered frame.  It's KIP.

She gets up and walks past Kip standing at the door, and continues the 
seven or eight feet to the right and out into the garden VIA THE HOLE 
<b>RIPPED OUT OF THE WALL.
</b>
<b>tttHANA
</b>ttExcuse me.  Yes?
tttt(of the doors)
ttI don't have the key to that door.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttThe Germans were here.  The Germans 
ttwere all over this area.  They left mines
tteverywhere.  Pianos were their favorite
tthiding places.  

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI see.
tttt(then mischievous)
ttThen may be you're safe as long as
ttyou only play Bach.  He's German.

Kip is looking around the piano.  Hana giggles.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttIs something funny?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttNo, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry.
ttYou came to the doors, that's all and -
tttt(a little laugh)
<b>tt#NAME?
</b>ttworried about mines.  That's all.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttI've met you before.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI don't think so.

Hana bends to see what Kip's looking at under the piano.  Wires run 
from the wall to the instrument onto which is taped an EXPLOSIVE 
CHARGE.   If Hana had succeeded in moving the piano she would have 
triggered the charge.  Kip looks at Hana who conceals her dismay with a 
shrug.


110a*.tEXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DUSK.

Across from the terrace, HARDY AND KIP ARE PUTTING UP THEIR TENTS.  
Caravaggio stands, chatting amiably to them, holding a haversack, 
smoking a cigarette.


<b>111*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DUSK.
</b>
Hana looks down from the Patient's room, watching the tents go up.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttHe wants us to move out, says there
ttcould be fifty more mines in the building.
ttHe thinks I'm mad because I laughed at
tthim.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttSikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.

Kip glances up at the window.  Hana, suddenly shy, backs away.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI'll probably marry him.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttReally?  That's sudden.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttMy mother always told me I would
ttsummon my husband by playing the piano.

She goes over to the Patient's bed.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI liked it better when there were
ttjust the two of us.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttWhy?  Is he staying?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWith his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttWe should charge!  Doesn't anyone
tthave a job to do?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttThey have to clear all the local roads
ttof mines.  That's a big job.  They won't
ttstay in the house.  They're putting up
tttheir tent in the garden.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttIn that case, I suppose we can't charge.

A SMALL OFFICE, shared by two men, and a mountain of filing cabinets

The approach to the Shepheard's Hotel.  Geoffrey Clifton in a TAXI, 
champagne between his knees.

The car ahead of them SCREECHES TO A HALT as a WOMAN hurries across the 
street.  The driver honks his horn angrily.  The woman puts up a hand 
in apology as she skips across the street to another taxi.  IT'S 
KATHARINE - she's dressed for a date, carries flowers, an overnight 
bag.

Geoffrey, at first excited, is troubled by the accouterments.  Then he 
sees Katharine skip and his whole being punctures.

Katharine's cab roars off.  His own car jerks forward.

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttStop!

<b>tttCABBIE
</b>ttPlease?

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttStop here.

<b>tttCABBIE

Geoffrey sits in the cab.  Fifty yards short of the hotel.  The world 
rushes by.  He finds a cigarette.


<b>114tINT.    ALMxc1SY'S ROOMS.    LATE DAY.

Katharine is in bed.  Almxe1sy has just put A RECORD on.  It's the folk 
song heard at the beginning of the film.  He slips back under the 
covers.  Their clothes are scattered around the room.  He lies over a 
happy Katharine.  She listens.

<b>tttKATHARINE

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttIt's a folk song.

ttIt's beautiful.  What's it about?

They embrace, he lies over her, considering her naked back.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI claim this shoulder blade - oh no,

He turns her over, kisses her throat, then traces the hollow 
indentation.

tttt(Katharine doesn't know)
ttI'm asking the King permission to

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(teasing)
ttI thought we were against ownership?
tttt(kissing him)
ttI can stay tonight.

The luxury of this makes them both sad.  The duplicity.  Almxe1sy rolls 
away on to his back.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttMadox knows, I think.  He's tried to
ttwarn me.  He keeps talking about
ttAnna Karenina.  I think it's his idea

takes a swig.  He notices the startled driver and puts up an apologetic 
arm.

<b>tttCLIFTON
</b>ttSorry.

Two or three CHILDREN knock on the window, begging.  Geoffrey knocks 
back, violently.  They disappear.

The MORNING PRAYERS rise out from the city's three Minarets.  Almxe1sy 
stops at a stall, which is just preparing to open for the day.  He 
picks up a SILVER THIMBLE, points at it to the merchant who gives him a 
price.  Without comment, Almxe1sy produces the money and, beaming, hands 
the thimble to Katharine.

Geoffrey, unshaven, watches as Katharine crosses the street and heads 
towards the hotel.  His expression is terrible, trying to smile, his 
face collapsed.


<b>120tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.
</b>
Cheek to Cheek leaks into the room from a GRAMOPHONE that Caravaggio 
stands over proudly.  The Patient opens his eyes - is confused, 
dislocated - stares blankly at Caravaggio.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>tttt(grinning)
ttThought you'd never wake up!

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttWhat?

Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhere did you find that?

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttI liberated it.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI think that's called looting.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>tttt(relaxed)
ttNo-one should own music.  The real
ttquestion is who wrote the song?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttIrving Berlin.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttFor?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttTop Hat.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttIs there a song you don't know?

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(speaking for him)
ttNo.  He sings all the time.

She goes over to the Patient and kisses him gently.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttGood morning.
tttt(of his singing)
ttDid you know that?  You're always singing?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttI've been told that before.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttKip's another one.

She goes to the window, looks over to where the tents are pitched, sees 
Hardy shaving, Kip IN THE PROCESS OF WASHING HIS HAIR, his turban 
HANGING LIKE A RIBBON between two trees to dry.  He's perched a bowl on 
the sundial and is dipping his long coal-black hair into it.  As Hana 
watches Kip, Caravaggio changes the record.  The Patient identifies it 
immediately.


<b>121*.tEXT.    MONASTERY GARDEN.     MORNING.
</b>
Hana walks past the tent, and passes Hardy.  She's carrying a small 
cup, which she's a little furtive about.  He's carrying a whole armada 
of OIL LIGHTS.  He nods upstairs.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttHello.

<b>tttHARDY
</b>ttHello miss.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI was going to say - if you want to
tteat with us, ever... you and Lieutenant
ttSingh...

<b>tttHARDY
</b>ttVery kind of you, we can always eat in
ttthe town with the others -

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttSince Caravaggio turned up - food
ttseems to appear, so please.

<b>tttHARDY
</b>ttI'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttYou saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.
tttt(Hardy waves that away)
ttI thought you were very very tall.  You
ttseemed to big - a Giant - and I felt
ttlike a child who can't keep her balance.

<b>tttHARDY
</b>tttt(does a little mime)
ttA toddler

She goes on, and tentatively approaches Kip, who's still working at his 
hair.  Kip hears her and puts out an inquiring arm, moving towards her 
like a blink man through the curtain of hair.  He touches her.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttSorry, is it all right I'm seeing this?

Kip shrugs.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttMy hair was long.  At some point.  
ttI've forgotten what a nuisance it is
ttto wash.  You know - if you were ever
ttaround - we get water from the pump
ttat noon.

He continues to wash.  She holds up the cup of oil.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttTry this.  I found a great jar of it.  
ttOlive oil.  In Naples this was so
ttprecious it would have bought you a wife.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttThank you.

She stands for a second, then walks away.  Kip examines the oil, calls 
after her.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttFor my hair?

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(turning, smiling)
ttYes, for your hair.


<b>122tEXT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S GARDEN.    DAY.
</b>
HANA IS GARDENING, close to the crucifix, which is now a full-fledged 
Scarecrow.  Broken bottles, fragments of stained glass and shards from 
a mirror are hung from the crossbar, syringes too, all jangling and 
tinkling and catching the sunlight.

Kip and Hardy drive off to work on their motorcycles.  She watches 
them, catching Kip's careless wave to her.  She looks briefly at 
herself in A PIECE OF MIRROR dangling from the Scarecrow.


<b>123tINT.    THE MONASTERY.    UPSTAIRS LANDING.    DAY.
</b>
Hana walks along the landing with a tray.  There's a message on several 
doors in the corridor from Kip: SAFE, then a couple with the warning: 
DANGER.  She hears noise from the Patient's room.  Listens for a second 
before going in.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT (O/S)
</b>ttBecause you're reading it too fast!

<b>tttTHE PATIENT (O/S)
</b>ttNot at all.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT (O/S)

During this, Hana comes through with the tray, finds Kip perched on the 
window, relishing his skirmish with the Patient, who has condensed milk 
dribbling down his neck.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttWhat I really object to, Uncle, is

Hana and the Patient are alone.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI didn't like that book either.  It's

ttAnyway, he's indifferent to me.

Kip comes bounding in with a fresh can.

<b>126.ttttINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.   MORNING.
</b>
Caravaggio and the Patient are singing - an Arab song which they both 
know from Cairo days.  THUNDER accompanies them.  It's pouring.  
Suddenly the door is flung open and HANA, KIP and HARDY appear.  They 
have the stretcher with them.


<b>127*.tEXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    MORNING.
</b>
A whoop precedes THE HEADLONG RUSH OF KIP, HARDLY and CARAVAGGIO as 
they cart the Patient across the Cloisters like manic stretcher-
bearers.  Hana is with them, holding an umbrella over the Patient who 
bounces uncomfortably.  He is nervous, a little giddy.  The rain 
buckets down.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>tttt(no irony)
ttCareful - careful!


127a*.tEXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    MORNING.

The storm tour includes a trip around the pond.  The Patient pushes 
away the umbrella, lets the rain drench him.   He grins at Hana.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttThis is wonderful!

<b>tttKIP
</b>tttt(to Hana)
ttWhat's he saying?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttHe's saying it's wonderful!


<b>128*.tINT.  LIBRARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EGYPTOLOGY.  DAY.

Madox and Almxe1sy are camped in one corner of THE LIBRARY, hunched over 
their maps and papers and journals and clashing furiously over the site 
of the next part of the expedition.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>tttt(pushing away his charts)
ttAnd I'm telling you there's nothing

</b>ttSo - on Thursday you don't trust
ttBell's map - Bell was a fool, Bell

Almxe1sy is surprised by Madox' anger.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttAnd where are the Expedition Maps?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttIn my room.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttThose maps belong to His Majesty's

<b>129tINT.   CAIRO STREET.   DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy and Madox walk down this busy and rather narrow street without 
pavements.  Both of them somber.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWhy do they care about our maps?

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttWhat do we find in the desert?  Arrow
ttheads, spears.  In a war, if you own the
ttdesert, you own North Africa.

<b>tttALMxc1SY

ttOwn the desert.

Almxe1sy hesitates at a junction, clearly about to take leave of Madox.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttThat place at the base of a woman's

ttdoes that have an official name?

Madox looks at him.

<b>130tINT.    OPEN-AIR CINEMA.    CAIRO.    EVENING.
</b>
The OPEN-AIR CINEMA is just beginning its evening programme.

PATHE NEWS BEGINS and we date the event to April 1939.  Stories of 
imminent war jostle with images of Merrie England.  Village greens, 
sporting victories, Cruft's Dog Show.  Alone among the necking couples 
- mostly soldiers with their Egyptian girlfriends - in an otherwise 
empty block, is Katharine.  She's waiting for Almxe1sy.  A SOLDIER comes 
over to Katharine's row and settles a couple of seats away from her.

<b>tttSOLDIER
</b>ttBeggin your pardon, miss, but have
ttyou got a lighter?

Katharine lights his cigarette and returns to the screen.  An item 
about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and TOP HAT.  The stars do their 
stuff.  The soldier moves a seat nearer.

<b>tttSOLDIER
</b>tttt(leering)
ttI love Ginger, she's a foxy girl, ain't she?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttFuck off.

<b>tttSOLDIER
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttYou heard me.

The Soldier slinks off, muttering.  Katharine is wretched.  She sits 
head down, not watching the screen, marooned in her despair about 
duplicity, sordid assignations.

Almxe1sy arrives, slides in beside Katharine, his shadow momentarily 
large across the screen.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttSorry.

They watch the screen.  Katharine is weeping.  Almxe1sy doesn't 
understand.  He puts his arm around her.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI can't do this, I can't do this any more.


<b>131*.tEXT.    GROPPI PARK.    CAIRO.    EVENING.
</b>
A man walks round with A HAND BELL - announcing that the Park is 
closing.  He turns off the gaslights which illuminate the animal cages.  
Almxe1sy and Katharine sit stiffly on a bench.  They don't speak.  Almxe1sy 
puts his hands to his head, he rubs his shoulders.  The lights are 
gradually being extinguished around them.

tFinally, Katharine gets up.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI'd better get back.
tttt(she keeps him away with a hand)
ttSay goodbye here.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm
ttagreeing, because I'm not.

They stand, awkward.  Katharine rehearses her position.  The bell 
clangs.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttI just know - any minute he'll find out,
ttwe'll barge into somebody we'll - and it
ttwill ill him.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttDon't go over it again, please.

He takes her hands, lays his cheeks into them, then releases them, gets 
up, walks away.  She walks towards the gate.  He calls after her.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttKatharine -

tHe walks towards her, his smile awful.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI just wanted you to know.
ttI'm not missing you yet.

She nods, can't find this funny.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttYou will.  You will.

Then she turns sharply from him and catches her head against the 
gatepost, staggers at the shock of it, then hurries away.


<b>132*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    MORNING.
</b>
Hana sits with the English Patient - the room shuttered against the 
morning light.  His breathing is noticeably worsening, a shudder of a 
breath, the shallow rise and fall of his chest perceptible.  Hana 
frets, touches his wrist, feeling for the pulse.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttI'm still here.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttYou'd better be.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttDon't depend on it.  Will you?
ttThat little bit of air, each day
ttthere's less of it, which is al right,
ttwhich is quite all right.

She squeezes his hand, suddenly overwhelmed.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>tttt(brightly)
ttI've been talking to Caravaggio - my
ttresearch assistant - there's meant to be
tta ghost in the Cloisters.  I can join him!

There's some kind of noise from the garden.  Muffled shouts.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttIt's the boy.

Hana goes to the window, opens the shutters.  The day pours in.


<b>132A*.tEXT.    MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES.    DAY.
</b>
Hana sees Kip - barely visible - standing at the far perimeter of the 
garden in the olive groves, HIS HANDS RAISED ABOVE HIM, HIS LEG HELD 
OUT STRANGELY.  WIRES run from his foot in all directions as if he'd 
trodden in some elaborate steel cobweb.


<b>133tEXT.    MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES.    DAY.
</b>
Hana appears at the edge of the Olive groves and hurries towards Kip, 
who hasn't moved.  He shouts warning her.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttGo to the left!  Keep to the left!  There
ttare mines and trip wires everywhere!

Hana stops, hoists up her skirt and circles left, tentative in the long 
grass.  He shouts, doesn't want her close.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttGet Hardy.  He's on the other side of 
tttown.  In the hills.  Get him to hurry.

She keeps coming, can see that he needs her.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttIt's okay - I'll help.  Please.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttThe mines, the wires, there's a trick.
ttSome explode if you stretch the wires,
ttsome if you cut them.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhat do I do?

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttThere's a mine here, but the others are
ttfar enough away, I think at least to
ttgive me a chance.  I have to work out
ttwhich one to cut before I fall over.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttSo I follow the wires?

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttYou get Hardy.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI follow the wires.

She kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttDon't touch them.

She follows one wire back to the closest mine, and traces another back 
to Kip's foot.  Then she finds another one leading off to a second mine 
some thirty metres away.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhy would anyone do this?

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttI've done this.  I've had to do this.

tThen Hana's suddenly tense.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttGive me a second.

She turns and tiptoes RIGHT THROUGH THE DANGER AREA, straight to what 
had seized her attention.  Kip is appalled.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttWhat are you doing?!  Hana!

Heedless, she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as THE 
TORTOISE clambers onto a clump of rock, which is, in fact, ANOTHER 
<b>CONCRETE-COVERED MINE.
</b>
Hana snatches him up as he ambles towards the metal.  She turns, 
holding the protesting animal in triumph.  HER FOOT SNAGS ON A WIRE.  
She has to ease it off, in arabesque, still clutching the tortoise.   
She goes sideways to the safe zone - setting down the animal.  Then 
she's back with Kip.  He's seething.  She is strangely elated.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttWhat is this business with you and
ttexplosives?  Do you think you're immune?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI promise you that was the right thing
ttto do.  He's my good luck.
tttt(she gets the pliers from his belt,
and hands them to him)
ttNow cut.  This one.
tttt(she indicates the wire)
ttI hope we don't die.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttOkay.  Get away from here.  Quick.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI'm not scared.  So many people have
ttdied around me.  But I would be a
ttshame for us.
tttt(shrugs)
ttI don't feel like being shy.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttYou must get away.  Before I cut.  I'm
ttnot cutting if you're here.

He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttActually, you can't cut, can you?
ttYou'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttNo.

But he hands them over.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttKiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.


<b>tttKIP
</b>ttDon't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and
ttthen cut.

Hana checks, lies down.  He bends as close to the ground as he dares 
<b>AND KISSES HER, THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY CUTS.
</b>

<b>134tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    CONTINUOUS.
</b>
The Patient lies in bed.  He's agitated by the silence.  SUDDENLY 
THERE'S AN EXPLOSION.  He tries to shout, a croak which quickly reduces 
him to coughing and breathlessness.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttHana!  Hana!  Kip!  Hana!

He tries to move.  He can't.  He's frantic.

FOOTSTEPS, as someone hurtles up the stairs.  It's Hana.  She's ashamed 
to have forgotten him.  She rushes to him.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI'm sorry.  I forgot you'd be worrying.
ttWe're all safe.  It was a mine, but not
ttthe mine.  Nobody's hurt.  I'm sorry.

She calms him.  He's exhausted.  His eyes shine.


<b>135tEXT.    MOUNTAIN ROAD.    ITALY.    LATE DAY.
</b>
Hana clings onto Kip as the TRIUMPH MOTORCYCLE hares along the circling 
road.  She has her arms around his waist.  His head turns to her for a 
second and she smiles.

<b>136tEXT.    ROAD BLOCK.    TUSCANY.    DUSK.
</b>
Kip and Hana have been detained at a ROAD BLOCK.  Kip is being 
questioned at a sentry post, his papers over-thoroughly inspected and 
accompanied by several meaningful glances at Hana, who waits, standing 
by the motorcycle.  One of the SOLDIERS saunters over and returns her 
papers.

<b>tttSOLDIER
</b>ttAnd you're definitely traveling with
tthim of your own free will?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttYes.

<b>tttSOLDIER
</b>tttt(clearly disapproving)
ttJust wanting to be sure.  And he's
tttaking you to church?

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(deadpan)
ttYes.  We're going to a funeral.  A cow has
ttdied.  And in his religion they're sacred.

The Soldier isn't sure what to make of this.  He signals to his 
companion who returns Kip's papers.  Kip walks back to the motorcycles.  
He says nothing.  He kicks the starter.  Hana gets on, slides her arms 
lovingly around him.


<b>137tEXT.    BRIDGE.    ITALY.    DUSK.
</b>
IT'S GETTING DARK.  The bike, headlights on, crosses a bridge.  Kip has 
strapped on his crimson emergency light as they sail along the winding 
crest of mountain ridge that is a spine down Italy.


<b>138tEXT.    AREZZO.   DUSK.
</b>
tKip steers the motorbike into the deserted PIAZZA.

They dismount and Kip starts to unbuckle his bulging satchel and unload 
the panniers.  Hana still doesn't know what's in store and looks 
questioningly at Kip as he walks up to the door of the CHURCH.


<b>139tINT.    CHURCH.    DUSK.
</b>
They enter the Church.  It's in almost total darkness.  THEN A FLARE 
SUDDENLY ILLUMINATES THE INTERIOR.  It's magnificent.  Kip holds the 
flare, crimson on one arm, green pouring up from the other.  Hana walks 
behind him, still perplexed.  There is PROTECTIVE SCAFFOLDING 
<b>EVERYWHERE, AND SANDBAGS PILED UP HIGH AROUND THE ALTARS, AND THE 
</b><b>STATUES.
</b>
A SECOND FLARE.  Kip has appeared through A SECRET DOOR high in the 
church, literally emerging from one of the frescoes which are 
momentarily visible.  He flings a rope over the rafters.

Now Kip circles Hana with the rope, MAKING A SLING across her waist and 
shoulder.  He lights a smaller flair and hands it to her before 
disappearing.

Hana stands holding the flare.  She can't see Kip, can only hear him 
scrambling.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttKip?

He runs up the sandbags, right up into the rafters.  He collects the 
other end of the rope which is attached to Hana.  Holding onto it, he 
just STEPS OFF INTO THE DARKNESS.

SIMULTANEOUSLY HANA IS SWUNG UP INTO THE AIR, her startled yelp echoing 
around the Church.  Kip touches ground, while Hana swings through 
space, coming to rest about three feet from the FRESCOED WALLS, painted 
by Piero Della Francesca.  Hana's flare makes a halo around her head.

Now Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward and 
causes Hana to SWING to the right.  She lets out a giddy laugh, 
exhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating - en passant - 
faces, bodies, angels.  Kip guides the rope as if they were making 
love, which in a way they are.

Hana arrives, hovering, in front of THE QUEEN OF SHEBA TALKING TO 
SOLOMON. She's overwhelmed.  She reaches out to touch the giant neck of 
the sad Queen.

Kip slowly lets her down, paying out the length of the rope.  Hana's 
face is full of tears.  He smiles, holds her.


<b>140tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.

Caravaggio is with the Patient.  He sits in the window.  Fiddles with 
the bandages of his hands.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttThere was a general who wore a patch
ttover a perfectly good eye.  The men 
ttfought harder for him.  Sometimes I
ttthink I could get up and dance. 
ttWhat's under your bandages?

Caravaggio goes to him, holding out his hands, the bandage ends 
trailing.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttHold the ends.

The Patient holds them.  Caravaggio walks backwards, the bandages 
unraveling and unraveling.  


<b>141*.tINT.  TOBRUK.  BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.  JUNE 1942.  DAY.
</b>
Caravaggio, thumbs intact and wearing a crumpled linen suit, walks 
through the mangled corridors of British HQ.  Smoke is rising from 
buildings, the ominous scream of Stuka dive-bombers in the distance as 
the harbor is pounded, the steady thud of explosions.  TOBRUK IS UNDER

SECRETARIES are visiting braziers manned by ARAB BOYS who stoke the

Caravaggio walks through a large room crowded with desks.  From one of 
them, a young woman, AICHA, kisses him, frowning at the chaos and the 
shelling.

<b>tttAICHA
</b>ttHe's waiting for you.

Some doors are open, revealing men and women in uniform urgently 
SHREDDING DOCUMENTS.  Caravaggio knocks at an office whose door is ajar 
and where the incumbent, FENELON-BARNES, is stripping the room of his 
personal possessions-  photographs, stone branches, a cricket bat.

ttthe thinking is we'll be back - I mean,

ttthe ground.

A BIG BOMB lands nearby.  The building shudders and plaster dust drops 
from the ceiling.  Almost oblivious, the two men head out of the 
office.  Fenelon-Barnes lugs the TRUNK last glimpsed in his tent by 
Almxe1sy, until Caravaggio takes over.

A HILL OF SALVAGED ARMY BOOTS is being explored by a couple of GERMAN 
SOLDIERS in search of better footwear.  Below them the POWS trudge by, 
one of them barefoot.  ONE OF THE GERMANS tosses down a pair of boots 
then continues his own perusal.


146b*. EXT.    TOBRUK SQUARE.    DAY.

A crowd of Tobruk CIVILIANS - French and Italians among the MOSTLY ARAB 
FACES.  Their papers are being thoroughly checked by officers sitting 
at open desks. IN A LINE, WEARING HIS SHABBY SUIT, IS CARAVAGGIO.  AN 
ARAB WOMAN in front of him is arguing over the identity of her 
ominously CAUCASIAN-LOOKING CHILD.  An INTERPRETER mediates.  The 
OFFICER doesn't believe the woman.  She's getting frantic at the 
possibility of losing her child.

Suddenly there's a disturbance as a WOMAN is dragged along the line by 
her hair.  She's bloodied, and has been tortured, and it's hard to 
recognize her as the pretty AICHA.  She touches a couple of people in 
the line.  They're horrified.  Soldiers pull them away.  Caravaggio 
doesn't look, stares straight ahead.  An officer watches him AS HE 
<b>TURNS BRIEFLY AND HELPLESSLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR HER.  THEIR EYES CATCH 
</b><b>FOR AN INSTANT AND THE OFFICER SEES IT.
</b>
CARAVAGGIO RUNS, bolts for cover, vaulting the rubble which blocks one 
corner of the square.  The CONGREGATION throws itself to the ground 
until the square has only standing soldiers and a running man.


146c*. EXT.   TOBRUK.   INTERIOR OF RUINED BUILDING.   DAY.

Shots pursue Caravaggio as he disappears behind the rubble, then bobs 
up again as he darts inside a blasted building.  He clambers up some 
ruined stairs, heaves over the wall.


146d*. EXT.   TOBRUK.   FACADE OF RUINED BUILDING.   DAY.

CARAVAGGIO grabs a metal bar on the facade of the building, from which 
he hangs, looking for the next foothold.  Soldiers appear along the top 
of the building, shouting, rifles ready.  AN OFFICER arrives and stops 
the soldiers firing, and the others begin to laugh as Caravaggio hangs 
from the bar fifteen feet above a balcony, slowly losing his strength.  
Another SOLDIER waits for him in the balcony below.  Now he starts to 
laugh.  Caravaggio hangs.


<b>147*.tINT. INTERROGATION ROOM. TOBRUK. NOVEMBER 13,1942. DAY.
</b>
Caravaggio is slumped at a table, HIS HANDS MANACLED TO ITS THICK 
WOODEN LEGS.  There's A TELEPHONE at another table in the corner of the 
room attended by a CLERK with A STENOGRAPHER working next to him.  The 
room has stone walls which appear damp, and no windows.  SOLDIERS stand 
guard at the door.  It's a horrible room.  Caravaggio is trying to 
sleep, he's unshaven, and pasty-looking.  His interrogator, Mxfcller, 
seems incredibly tired and aggravated.  He's on the phone.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>tttt(in German)
ttYes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

He slams down the phone and comes back to the table.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttDavid Caravaggio.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttNo.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttPetty thief, six months imprisonment

</b>tttt(barely with humor)
ttI keep explaining.  You've got the wrong
ttman.  My name is Bellini - Antonio
ttBellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both
ttpainters, I think that is confusing you.

Mxfcller doesn't even pay attention, he's going through a file.  Pulls 
out some photographs, starts spreading them out.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttIs this you?

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttIt is you.  This was taken in Cairo at

ttthis - August 41.  And this -February 42.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttIt's impossible.  I was buying or selling
ttsomething.  I've been to Cairo many times.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttYou are a Canadian spy working for

THE PHONE rings again, is answered.  The Clerk calls to Mxfcller who gets 
up, irritably.  Caravaggio addresses the room.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttCould I have a doctor?  I am passing
ttblood.  I must be bleeding internally.
tttt(to the clerk)
ttCan you get a doctor?  Look -
tttt(he spits onto the table,
there's blood in his mouth)
ttI'm leaking blood.
tttt(he indicates a Guard)
ttHe kicks me.  He kicks me all the time.

Nobody responds.  Mxfcller is irascible on the phone, checking his watch, 
negotiating time.  The call finishes.

<b>tttCLERK
</b>tttt(in German)
ttHe's asking for a doctor.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>tttt(to Caravaggio)
ttYou want a doctor?

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttYes, I've been asking for weeks, a

</b>ttWe don't have a doctor, but we
ttdo have a nurse.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttA nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great.
ttA nurse?  Great.

Mxfcller nods at the Clerk, who instantly gets up.  Just then the 
telephone rings again.  He hesitates.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>tttt(in German)
ttLeave it and get the nurse!

The Clerk exits.  The phone rings.  The Stenographer is plagued by 
flies.  Suddenly he slaps at one.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>tttt(snapping)
ttWhy is there so much nose?  I can't
tthear myself think!
tttt(turns to Caravaggio)
ttLook - give me something.  So we can

ttIt's too hot.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttI slept with the girl.  I've got a wife

The NURSE comes in.  She is Arab and her head is covered.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttI'll tell you what I'm going to do.  This

ttleave it at that.  You're married and 
ttyou were fucking another woman, so
ttthat's - is it the hands that are cut off?
ttOr is that for stealing?  Does anyone know?

There's silence.  Mxfcller turns to Caravaggio.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttWell, you must know.  You were 
ttbrought up Libya, yes?

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttDon't cut me.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttOr was it Toronto?

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>tttt(ashen)
ttDon't cut me.  Come on.

Now the phone starts again.  The CLERK picks it up, there's a terse 
exchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the moment to 
interrupt Mxfcller.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttTen fingers.  How about this?  You
ttgive me a name for every finger -
ttdoesn't matter who.  I get something,
ttyou keep something.  I'm trying to be
ttreasonable.  Fenelon-Barnes, we could 
ttcall that two names.
tttt(pauses, suddenly puzzled)
ttAre thumbs fingers?
tttt(in GERMAN to the others)
ttIs a thumb a finger?

No response.  Mxfcller opens his palms to Caravaggio.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttI get no help from these people.

<b>tttCLERK
</b>tttt(in German)
ttThe telephone -

Mxfcller walks over, takes the receiver and slams it down.  an AIR RAID 
SIREN is going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is 
also discernible, but all muffled in this room with the steady clack-
clack of the STENOGRAPHER.  At that moment, Mxfcller suddenly becomes 
aware of what is happening.  He turns on the Stenographer.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>tttt(in German)
ttWhat are you doing?

<b>tttSTENOGRAPHER
</b>tttt(awkward, in German)
ttThat Geneva Convention.  I'm -

tMxfcller peremptorily rips out the paper, throws it on the floor.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttYou can't do that!  Hey - come on!

DURING THIS Mxfcller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer and 
produced A CUT-THROAT RAZOR.  He hands it to the nurse, makes a line 
across his own left thumb and jerks his head towards Caravaggio.  The 
nurse is extremely reluctant.  Mxfcller claps his hands, pushes her 
towards Caravaggio.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttGo!  Hey!  Go!

Caravaggio is in terror.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttOh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.

The guards come away from the door and press down on Caravaggio's 
shoulders to prevent him from moving.  The nurse, grim-faced, 
approaches, kneels at the table. 

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>tttt(as she prepares to cut)
ttListen, I'll give you a name.  What
ttname did you say?  I knew them!
ttI promise.  Please - please!

And then he SCREAMS AND SCREAMS and jerks up, carrying the guards and 
the table with him, all heaving off the ground, the nurse thrown off 
balance.  He falls to the floor, ROARING WITH PAIN, blood everywhere, 
the table on top of him.  The AIR RAID is continuing outside, the PHONE 
IS RINGING, the nurse stands, pale, blood all over her uniform.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttCut the other thumb.

He stabs at his own right thumb.

<b>tttMxdcLLER
</b>ttThis one!  Come on!

The nurse, horrified, shakes her head.  Mxfcller snatches the razor from 
her and heads towards the prostate Caravaggio.

One Guard has got to his feet and grips Caravaggio around the neck in 
half-nelson, others holding his legs, while Mxfcller approaches.  
Caravaggio can't move.  He's gurgling as the Guard almost strangles 
him.  His eyes are streaming with tears.

Now Mxfcller is at his other hand, and the ROAR of pain again lifts 
Caravaggio to his feet, THE WHOLE TABLE RISING IN THE AIR, his 
mutilated hands slipping from the handcuffs lie Houdini, the drawers of 
the table SPILLING their contents everywhere, before he sinks to his 
knees like a gored bull and BLACKS OUT.


<b>148tINT.    INTERROGATION ROOM.    TOBRUK.    DAY.
</b>
LATER, and Caravaggio comes round.  His eyes open and then his face 
spasms with pain.  He looks down at his ruined hands, then realizes 
he's alone on the floor of the room, the papers still scattered, the 
table on its side.  He gets up and staggers out of the open door and up 
the stairs.


<b>149*.tINT.  STAIRS FROM INTERROGATION ROOM.  TOBRUK.   DAY.

</b>The corridor is deserted, but the body of a GERMAN SOLDIER sprawls on 
the stairs leading up to daylight.  Outside Caravaggio can hear 
fighting.


<b>150*.tEXT.    ROOF.    INTERROGATION BUILDING.    DAY.
</b>
Caravaggio walks unsteadily along the roof of the building.  Grey and 
yellow gusts of smoke and the rat-ta-tat-tat of machine gun fire 
accompany him, and there's the sound of vehicles screeching and people 
shouting nearby, but no visual clues as to what's happening.

<b>SUDDENLY A PARACHUTE FLOATS DOWN BY HIM.  THEN ANOTHER.  THEN ANOTHER.  
</b><b>HE'S SURROUNDED BY PARACHUTES.  THE BRITISH ARE RECLAIMING TOBRUK.  A

</b>

<b>151*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.
</b>
Caravaggio stands in front of the bed, holding up his NAKED HANDS to 
the Patient, like a man surrendering - two flaps like gills where his 
thumbs were.  The Patient reaches out to take his hands and gently 
lowers them.  Caravaggio finds his bandages, start to wrap them back 
round his fists.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttThe man who took my thumbs, I found
tthim eventually - he's dead.  The man who
tttook my photograph, I found him too -
ttthat took me a year.  He's dead.  Another

ttCairo.  Now I intend to find him.

The LIGHTS FROM THE MOTORBIKE approaching the Monastery, its growl.  
Caravaggio goes to the window and watches as Kip and Hana arrive.


<b>152tINT.   AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.   CAIRO, 1939.   NIGHT.

Last seen at the Troops Christmas party, the INNER COURTYARD has been 
transformed into an elegant outdoor banquet, with band. The 
Almxe1sy/Madox team is assembled for A FAREWELL DINNER.  They are waiting 
for Almxe1sy to arrive, his seat conspicuously empty.  He is very late.  
And then he's there, dangerous drunk, terribly dashing.  He practically 
dances to his chair, which he drags violently away from its position 
opposite Katharine.  He bows to Lady Hampton.

at Clifton.

The Band is now playing Manhattan - Almxe1sy, without missing a beat, 
begins to sing, replacing the words with alternatives he knows.  He 
lurches around.  Katharine can't look at him.

Later, now MOST OF THE GROUP ARE DANCING.  We see Katharine dancing 
with Rupert Douglas, enjoying herself.  Bermann is there and even Madox 
jogging and grinning foolishly.  Clifton looks at Katharine who, as the 
dance ends, excuses herself to go to the cloakroom.  Almxe1sy hovers in 
the shadows, unseen.


<b>154*.tINT.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    NIGHT.

Katharine comes along the familiar warren of rooms and corridors and is 
suddenly confronted by Almxe1sy, tortured and out of control.

Some women, flushed with dancing, turn the corner on the way to the

fall back into the shadows.

sludge at the base of the viaduct.

Kip steps off and sinks knee deep in mud, grunting in disgust.

ttStop them!

Three Sappers run across the bridge towards the oncoming procession.  
They wave their orange flags, the tanks wave back wit their flags - 
Stars and Stripes, Union Jacks.  Now SHOTS are ringing out.  In the 
shaft, oblivious, Kip slides out from under the bomb, the oxygen 
spurting everywhere, all over his clothes, hissing on the surface of 
the water.  Hardy bends into the shaft, heedless of his own safety.

<b>tttHARDY
</b>ttYou've got to cut, sir, that frost
ttwon't last.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttGo away.

<b>tttHARDY
</b>ttYessir.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttThis is making me incredibly angry.

He rubs his hands to warm them up, locates his needle pliers and slips 
them through the tiny gap.  His hand touches the casing and the freeze 
BURNS his hand.  He jerks back, DROPPING THE PLIERS into the sludge, 
cursing.

Now he's on his hands and knees in the sludge, trying frantically to 
find the pliers.  Hardy looks at his watch, he can't help.  The seconds 
run out as Kip grovels in the mud.  Totally submerged, he suddenly 
comes out with the pliers, goes straight to the fuse, no finesse, and 
cuts.  There's a snip.  Then nothing.  Then Kip laughs at Hardy.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttKiss me.

Hardy is already at the winch, hauling it up.  Kip can hardly clip on 
the halter - his hands numb and burned.  As the pulley jerks he just 
clings on, rising from the grip of the mud like an ancient corpse out 
of a bog.

The other sappers have gathered around the edge of the site.  Great 
elation on their faces.

<b>tttHARDY 
</b>ttGet a blanket!
tttt(not getting attention)
ttDade!  Get the Lieutenant a blanket.

<b>tttDADE
</b>ttIt's over, Sarge.  It's over.  Jerry's surrendered.
tttt(to Kip)
ttSir, congratulations!

Kip shakes his hand.  Kip shakes Hardy's hand.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttCongratulations.  

And now they're all shaking hands, and slapping backs and the SOLDIERS 
FROM THE TANKS are there and the victory  celebrations begin.  Kip's 
blank, drained, not taking anything in, as Dade wraps a blanket around 
his shoulders.

HANA'S ON TOP OF THE VIADUCT, watching as Kip is wrapped in his 
blanket, the men celebrating.  She shouts with relief from the top of 
the bridge.

The gramophone plays Frank Sinatra.  Kip sits in the window, the 
shutters open, the village lit up behind his head, nodding to the 
music, sucking out of his condensed milk.  Elsewhere there is an open 
bottle of cognac, some wine.  The Patient has a beaker of wine.  
Caravaggio is dancing with Hana.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttKip - come and dance with me

<b>tttKIP
</b>tttt(a sly wobble of the head)
ttYes.  Later.

Caravaggio swirls past the Patient - nodding at the cognac.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttI've had a drink.  Fatal.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttWell, anything you do is likely 
ttto be fatal, so you know -

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttVery true!


<b>165tEXT.    VILLAGE SQUARE.    NIGHT.
</b>
A tiny PIAZZA where the Sappers and the Villagers are having their own, 
more raucous, Victory Feste.  There are accordions, there's dancing, 
and there's HARDY, stripped to some exotic underpants, a large tattoo: 
DORIS inside a heart, clambering up the EQUESTRIAN STATUE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE FOUNTAIN.  He's astride the horse and now straining to get up to 
the tip of the outstretched sword, so that he can hang the UNION JACK 
FLAG he has in his mouth.

BLACKLER, one of the Sappers, is Hardy's assistant.  He's drunk and 
slips from his ladder, falling flat on his back into the fountain with 
a great splash, to much hilarity.  


<b>166tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.
</b>
Hana and Caravaggio are still dancing.  The music has stopped.  
Caravaggio changes the record.  Hana goes to Kip for a second, beaming, 
before Caravaggio has snatched her away again.  The Patient taps along 
to the music.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttWho knows the Bosphorus Hug?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttNever heard of it.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttThat was a dance we invented at

ttWhat?  You and Madox?  Or you

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>tttt(a small laugh)
ttWhat?

There's a muddled thud in the distance, Kip's ears prick up.  He 
glances for an instant out of the window.

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(anxious, of the noise)
ttWhat was that?

She is spinning with Caravaggio.  When she comes round again, Kip has 
gone.


<b>167tEXT.    VILLAGE SQUARE.    ITALY 1945.    NIGHT.
</b>
tKip's motorbike skids into the tiny PIAZZA.

A MILITARY AMBULANCE IS ALREADY THERE.  Dade and SPALDING are presiding 
as the paramedics take two bodies into the rear of the truck.  The 
shattered fountain, the sluiced flagstones, shining wet and slick, give 
some clues as to what's happened, as do the elderly standing in the 
shadows, the distressed girls, arm in arm.  ONE GIRL, young and quite 
striking, is particularly inconsolable, her grief sobbed out at the 
doors of the ambulance.

SPALDING salutes Kip, who waves his salute away, just wanting to know 
what happened.

<b>tttSPALDING
</b>ttBooby trap.  They was running up the
ttUnion Jack, sir, up off that statue -
ttIt just went off.

<b>tttDADE
</b>ttShould have been me.  It was my idea
ttbut Sergeant Hardy climbed up, sir,
tthim and Blackler.

Kip goes to the ambulance.  Spalding tries to stop him.

<b>tttSPALDING
</b>ttSir - you don't want to look.

Kip steps into the back of the ambulance, bends over both bodies, does 
look, then comes out, past the weeping girl.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttWho's that girl?

<b>tttDADE
</b>ttHis fiancee, sir.

<b>tttKIP
</b>tttt(astonished)
ttHardy's?

<b>tttDADE
</b>ttKept it a bit dark.


<b>168tEXT.    THE MONASTERY.    APPROACHING DAWN.
</b>
Kip has pulled out all of Hardy's gear.  Now he starts on the tent.  
Hana comes out into the step.  Kip turns, his eyes brimming, sees her, 
sighs, then turns back and kicks at the pegs, collapsing the tent.

Now he's trying to fold a shirt.  Hana takes it from him.  She folds 
it.  Then together they start to fold the tent, Kip orchestrating, not 
wanting to talk.  Finally, Kip looks at Hana, stiff with emotion.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttI was thinking yesterday - yesterday! -
ttthe Patient, Hardy: they're
tteverything that's good about England.
ttI couldn't even say what that was.

Caravaggio, reading Dante aloud in Italian, smoking, walks over to the 
window, looks out.

Hana is approaching Kip's tent, carrying a light.  She ducks inside the 
tent and the light disappears.

Caravaggio turns back into the room, towards the Patient, still 
reading.


<b>170tINT.    KIP'S TENT.    NIGHT.
</b>
Hana lies over Kip, unraveling his turban, slowly, sensual.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttIf one night I didn't come to the tent,
ttwhat would you do?
<b>tttKIP
</b>ttI try not to expect you.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttBut if it got late and I hadn't shown up?

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttThen I'd think there must be a reason.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttYou wouldn't come to find me?
tttt(Kip shrugs)
ttThat makes me never want to come here.

But she continues unraveling the turban.

<b>171*.tEXT.   BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.  1939.  DAY.

The Expedition Team is packing up the Basecamp.  Madox and Almxe1sy are 
loading things into the plane.  FOUAD, AL AUF and others work at the 
cars.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttHad a letter from my wife.  The wisteria

</b>ttI told you so.

</b>ttWe didn't care about countries.

</b>ttI'll leave the plane in the hangar at
ttKufra Oasis.  So if you need it...hard to

ttmight all be back in a month or two.

Madox kneels and takes A HANDFUL OF SAND, puts it into his pocket.  He 
throws his haversack into the plane then turns.  Almxe1sy puts out a 
hand.  This is a moment of great emotional weight for them both, 
conducted as if nothing were happening.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttI have to teach myself not to read
tttoo much into everything.  Comes of

</b>ttMay God make safety your companion.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(a tradition)
ttThere is no God.
tttt(smiles)
ttBut I hope someone looks after you.

Madox clambers into his plane, then remembers something, jabs at his 
throat.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttIn case you're still wondering - this
ttis called the supasternal notch.

Almxe1sy nods, goes to the propeller.

<b>tttMADOX
</b>ttCome and visit us in Dorset.  When
ttall this nonsense is over.
tttt(then shrugs)
ttYou'll never come to Dorset.

The plane roars into life.  Almxe1sy watches it taxi away - then heads 
back to continue with his packing up.


<b>172*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.
</b>
MADOX SHOOTS HIMSELF BEHIND THE ALTAR IN THE ROOM.  The Patient's 
stertorous breathing, each intake accompanied by a small noise, a note, 
suddenly stops.  Then steadies again.  He appears to be alone.


<b>173tEXT.    GARDEN.    NIGHT.

Kip is in the tent, looking out of the flap, waiting for Hana.

Kip walks in looking for Hana.


174a*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Kip enters, sees Hana is not with the Patient, hears his uneven 
breathing, then goes out.  From the shadows of the room, CARAVAGGIO 
shifts position.   He's slumped on the floor, staring at the man prone 
in the bed.


174b*.tINT.    HANA'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Into her bedroom, Kip can't find her there either.  He turns to go, 
walking down the wooden stairs, until her voice stops him in his 
tracks.  She's in the shadows of the eaves.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttSometimes I need you to find me.


<b>175*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.     NIGHT.

The Patient's eyes open to see Caravaggio at the morphine.

ttThere are going to be trials, they

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttWe shall miss you.

He delivers the injection.  The Patient sighs.  Caravaggio takes off 
his jacket.  A pistol is stuck in his waistband.  The Patient sees it.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttSo, I come across the Hospital Convoy
tttt(holds up the syringe)
ttI was looking for this stuff, and some

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttBefore you went over to the Germans,

ttHe took some pretty good photographs -
ttI saw mine in that torture room in

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttAnd you thought you'd come and

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttYou were the only man who knew
ttthe desert well enough, the only
ttman who would cross seventeen
tthundred miles of nothing.

</b>ttThe rest meant nothing to me.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttThere was a result to what you did.
ttIt wasn't just another expedition.

ttIt did this.  If the British hadn't

<b>176*.tEXT.   BASECAMP AT CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   1939.   DAY.

Almxe1sy sits on a ridge transferring map of information from his 
Herodotus onto a sheet of paper.  He looks up at the sound of Clifton's 
approaching Steerman.  He folds up the map and sticks it inside one of 
Clifton's CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES and lodges it between the rocks.

<b> 
</b>176a*.tINT.    STEERMAN.    DAY.

Clifton is flying the STEERMAN up to Gilf Kebir.  From the air it's 
possible to make out Almxe1sy scrambling down from the ridge towards 
where the stones indicate a landing area, carrying the last of the 
materials from the Cave of Swimmers.  Almxe1sy waves in recognition and 
welcome.


<b>177tEXT.   BASECAMP AT THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.   DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy watches as the plane drops towards him, shielding his eyes 
against the sun.  the plane bounces along the runway, not quite 
landing.  Almxe1sy continues packing the equipment.

Almxe1sy looks up to see the plane swerve, now suddenly HEADING STRAIGHT 
TOWARDS HIM.  He's completely vulnerable, nowhere to run.  He dives at 
the ground.  THE PLANE SMASHES AGAINST AN INVISIBLE RIDGE AND TURNS 
OVER AND OVER, the wings snapping off like twigs as it hurtles past the 
prostrate Almxe1sy.  He gets to his feet and starts to run towards the 
wreckage.

A blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the plane, but no fire.  Almxe1sy 
pulls away the debris to find  GEOFFREY - SLUMPED, NECK BROKEN, BLOODY.  
He tries to move him, and in the process reveals, to his ABSOLUTE 
horror, KATHARINE, STARING GRIMLY AHEAD, UNABLE TO MOVE.  He's frantic.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttKatharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine -
ttwhat are you doing here?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(eyes rolling, an incredible weariness)
ttI can't move.  I can't get out.

Almxe1sy starts to pull at the wreck around her.
<b>DURING THIS -
</b>
<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWhy did he bring you?

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttA surprise, he said.

Almxe1sy inspects Clifton, tries to find a pulse.  The smoke circles 
around them.  Katharine looks at her husband.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttPoor Geoffrey.  He knew.  He must
tthave known all the time.  He was
ttshouting - I love you, Katharine, 
ttI love you so much.  Is he badly hurt?
ttHis neck is odd.

Almxe1sy puts his arm around Katharine to try and pull her clear.  She 
can't stand the pain.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttPlease don't move me.  It hurts too much.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWe've got to get you out of here.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttIt hurts too much.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(can't bear to hurt her)
ttI know, darling, I'm sorry.

The smoke thickens.  He pulls - hard - the pain from which causes 
Katharine to gasp, then pass out.  They slip haphazardly to the ground, 
cushioned a little by the sand.  He lifts her gently into his arms and 
carries her from the danger of the place, then turns and runs back.  
THE PLANE SUDDENLY ERUPTS IN FLAMES.  Almxe1sy dashes into the fire, 
disappearing into the smoke before emerging with Clifton over his 
shoulder, fireman's-lift style.


<b>178tEXT.    THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.
</b>
He has WRAPPED KATHARINE IN THE SILK FOLDS OF HER PARACHUTE and emerges 
from the near the familiar cleft in the rock, struggling with the 
exertion of the climb as they approach the Cave of Swimmers.  He has a 
large water bottle slung around his neck and a haversack, and is loaded 
like a pack horse.  Katharine opens her eyes.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(whispering)
ttWhy did you hate me?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttDon't talk.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>tttt(gasping)
ttYou speak so many bloody languages
ttand you never want to talk.

They stagger on.  He suddenly notices a stain of gold at her neck.  
It's saffron, leaking from a silver THIMBLE which hangs from a black 
ribbon.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(overwhelmed)
ttYou're wearing the thimble.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttOf course.  You idiot.  I always wear it.
ttI've always worn it.  I've always loved you.

Almxe1sy CRIES as he walks - huge sobs, no words - convulsed with the 
pain of it.  They approach the Cave.


<b>179*.tINT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.

Almxe1sy comes through in shadows, carrying Katharine, blocking out the 
light that pours into the entrance of the cave.  Once inside, he sets 
her down incredibly gently, makes a bed of blankets and the parachute.  
He turns on his flashlight.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttIt's so cold.

<b>tttALMxc1SY

Almxe1sy returns with the stocks of ACACIA TWIGS the Expedition had 
cached.  As he makes the fire, the light sends his shadow flitting 
across the walls.

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttShall we be all right?

ttI should bump into one army or another
ttbefore I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes

<b>tttKATHARINE
</b>ttDo you promise?  I wouldn't want to die

He kisses her tenderly.  Pulls out his HERODOTUS and lays it beside 
her.  Then he puts down the FLASHLIGHT.

<b>tttALMxc1SY

He's tearing strips from the parachute with his knife.  As he starts to 
bind her wrist he gets her to talk, trying to distract her from the 
pain.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttTell me about your garden.

</b>
Almxe1sy lowers himself by an old rope down into a gully.  He approaches 
a pile of stones and removes them to reveal a brackish pool of filthy 
water.  He drinks, pouring water over his head, grimacing at the taste, 
but parched too.


<b>184*.tEXT.    APPROACHING EL TAJ.    DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy gets his first sight of the fortress town of EL TAJ and sinks to 
his knees, in relief and exhaustion.  Then he gets up and trudges 
towards the town.  A CORPORAL with a rifle in his hands appears.


184a*.tINT.    EL TAJ.    DAY.

The Corporal brings Almxe1sy into a square.  A young OFFICER appears from 
the shadows of his office.  His JEEP is parked in the shade.

<b>tttOFFICER
</b>ttGood morning!

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttCould I trouble you for some water?

<b>tttOFFICER
</b>tttt(registering the accented English)
ttYes, of course.
tttt(the Corporal has a water bottle,
hands it to Almxe1sy)
ttSo, golly, where have you come from?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(gulping the water)
ttI desperately need a jeep.  There's
ttbeen an accident.

<b>tttOFFICER
</b>ttI see.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(brain racing)
ttNo, I'm not thinking clearly - I need
tta doctor too, to come with me, can I
tttake this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course -
ttand some morphine and...
tttt(calculating)
ttSeventy miles - I can be back
tthere by dusk.

<b>tttOFFICER
</b>ttDo you have your papers, sir?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttOFFICER
</b>ttIf I could just see some identification.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttAm I not talking sense? -  forgive me,
ttI'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a
ttwoman badly injured at Gilf Kebir,
ttin the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a
ttmember of the Royal Geographical
ttSociety.

<b>tttOFFICER
</b>ttRight.  And what's your name, sir?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttCount Laszlo de Almxe1sy.

The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.

<b>tttOFFICER
</b>ttAlmxe1sy - would you mind just
ttspelling that for me?  What
ttnationality would that be?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttLook, listen to me.  A woman is dying -
ttmy wife! - is dying seventy miles from
tthere.  I have been walking for three
ttdays!  I don't want to spell my name, 
ttI want you to give me this jeep!

<b>tttOFFICER
</b>tttt(writing)
ttI understand you are agitated -
ttperhaps you would like to sit down
ttwhile I radio back to HQ -

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(snapping)
ttNo!  NO!  Don't radio anybody,
ttjust give me the fucking jeep!

Almxe1sy sets on the Officer, hauling him by the lapels, but them 
immediately loses his balance.  As he stumbles up he gets the stock of 
the Corporal's RIFLE across his head, KNOCKING HIM TO THE GROUND.


<b>185*.tEXT.   EL TAJ STREET.    DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy, head pounding, is in the back of the jeep, chained to the 
tailgate.  He's desperate.  The Corporal is driving.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>tttt(shouting hoarse)
ttHey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me
ttout of here - there's a woman dying,
ttthere's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!

<b>tttCORPORAL
</b>ttShut-up!

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttPlease - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you,
ttplease listen to me, this is a terrible
ttmistake.  Just stop, please, and
ttlisten to me.  My wife is dying.

<b>tttCORPORAL
</b>ttListen, Fritz, if I have to listen
ttto another word from you I'll
ttgive you a fucking good hiding.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttFritz?  What are you talking about?
ttWho's Fritz?

<b>tttCORPORAL
</b>ttThat's your name innit?  Count
ttFucking Arsehole Von Bismarck?
ttWhat's that supposed to be then, Irish?

Almxe1sy, berserk, starts to yank at his chains, screaming.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttLet me out, let me out, let me out -
ttKatharine!  Katharine!


<b>186tINT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.
</b>
Katharine has been writing in the Herodotus.  The torchlight FLICKERS.  
She shakes the torch.   It FLICKERS again.  Then goes out.  Absolute 
BLACKNESS.  The sound of her trembling breath.


<b>187*.tEXT.    A TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.
</b>
A TRAIN scuttles through the desert.


187a*.tINT.    THE TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.

Almxe1sy is HANDCUFFED to the metal grille of the goods compartment.  
He's lying down amongst a bunch of other prisoners and their little 
bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell - some Arabs, some 
Italians.

A SERGEANT pushes a lavatory-bound prisoner along the corridor, leaving 
behind A YOUNG PRIVATE who sits on a packing case, with a rifle across 
his lap, reading a Penguin edition of Gulliver's Travels.  Almxe1sy is in 
complete despair to be on the train.  He tries to move, but he's locked 
tight to the grille.  He rattles the cuffs against the metal.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttExcuse me.
tttt(the Soldier looks up)
ttI also need to use the lavatory.

<b>tttSOLDIER
</b>ttYou'll have to wait.
tttt(calls up the corridor)
ttSarge!  Jerry wants to use the lav -
ttsays it's urgent.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttWhere are we going, please?

<b>tttSOLDIER
</b>ttTo the coast.  Benghazi.  Soon be there.
ttGet a boat home.  You'll be all right.

ALMxc1SY CAN'T BEAR THIS NEWS.  The SERGEANT returns.

<b>tttSERGEANT
</b>ttWhat's up?

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttCramps.  It's urgent.

<b>tttSERGEANT
</b>ttGo on then - you take him.


<b>188tINT.    THE TRAIN CORRIDOR.    THE DESERT.    DAY.
</b>
The Soldier pushes Almxe1sy along the corridor.  They arrive outside the 
lavatory.  The Soldier is distracted for a split second.  Enough for 
Almxe1sy to ELBOW HIM savagely in the stomach, winding him, then he KICKS 
HIM REPEATEDLY in the head.  He wraps his cuffs around the Soldier's 
neck and - yanking them together and twisting - produces a tiny, 
efficient and sickening snap.

He finds the KEY to the handcuffs, unlocks them, grabs the soldier and 
drags him into the empty lavatory.


<b>189tINT.    TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    EVENING.
</b>
Almxe1sy arrives at the rear of the train, passes the Kitchen carriage, 
where Arabs sweat over the boiler.  He pulls open the back door only to 
surprise a GUARD, who's lolling casually, enjoying the sunset.  Almxe1sy 
SHOOTS HIM with his stole rifle.  He clambers over the guard rail and 
leaps off the train - tumbling into the desert sunset.


<b>190tEXT.    RAILWAY TRACK.    THE DESERT.    EVENING.
</b>
Almxe1sy, silhouetted against the evening sky, walks back down the track, 
THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY from the dying Katharine Clifton, no way now 
of saving her.  He is a tiny speck in the vast desert.  His heart 
broken.  He sinks to his knees in despair.


<b>191*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.
</b>
The Patient is exhausted.  He has said aloud what has tortured him.  
His failure to save Katharine.  He looks at Caravaggio.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttSo yes.  She died because of me.
ttBecause I loved her.  Because I 
tthad the wrong name.


<b>192tINT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    DAY.
</b>
Kip is working at a BLACKSMITH'S FORGE in the Stables.  He is heating 
pieces of metal.  He has arranged his material on a bench - a bayonet, 
a rifle, a piece of bomb casting.

tHana enters, goes up, hugs him from behind.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttWhat are you up to?

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttThat gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon -
ttZamzammah - remember?  That was 
ttmade out of the metal of ordinary things.  
ttI want to make an ordinary thing
ttout of guns.

His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttWhen I went to England I was amazed at
ttwhat went on, the waste - I'd been taught
ttto re-use everything, the dung from a cow
ttto cool a radiator, a fork to fix a
tttypewriter - India could live for a 
tthundred years on what I saw thrown away.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI should go to the house, get breakfast.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttThe lamp was burning all night in his
ttroom.  Caravaggio was there with him.

She goes to kiss him.   He is over the fire and protests.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttThis is hot!

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(teasing him)
ttNya-nya-nya!


<b>193*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
</b>
Caravagio is injecting the Patient with morphine.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttAnd did you never see Katharine?  You
ttnever got back to the Cave?

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttYes, I got back there finally to keep
ttmy promise.  To come back for her.
ttAnd then of course I couldn't... I
ttcouldn't even do that properly.


<b>194tINT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    DAY.
</b>
Kip hammers the metal into its new shape.  He stops, distracted by 
something he's listening to on his crystal set.  It's new he seems not 
to fully understand, about a bomb dropping on Japan.  A NEW KIND OF 
<b>BOMB.
</b>
<b>THE METAL GLOWS A VIVID RED ON THE ANVIL.
</b>Suddenly Kip slops it into the trough of water, sending a great hissing 
column of steam.


<b>195*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
</b>
Caravaggio sits by the Patient.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttYou get to the morning and the
ttpoison leaks away, doesn't it?
ttBlack nights, fucking black nights,
ttwhen you want to howl like a dog.
ttI thought I would kill you.  You
ttkilled my friends, you ruined my
tthands.  But the girl was always
tthere, like some Guardian Angel.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttYou can't kill me.  I died years ago.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttNo, now I can't kill you.

Kip storms into the room, walks straight up to the Patient and POINTS A 
GUN AT HIM.  Caravaggio is taken by surprise.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttKip - what are - ?

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttStay out of this.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttKip?

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttI looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother
ttalways said I was a fool.  Never trust the
ttBritish, he said: the deal-makers, the
ttmap-makers; never shake hands with them.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttWhat have I been doing all this time?
ttDo you know how many mines I've seen? -
ttmore mines than there are soldiers, more -
tthow many mines we've put in the ground
ttourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped
ttout of the sky.  And now this.

He approaches the bed.  Caravaggio tries to intervene.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttKip, listen -

Kip sings the rifle at him, KNOCKING HIM to the floor.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttI said keep out of this!

He pulls of his earphones and rams them around the Patient's head, 
dropping the set onto the bed.  The Patient listens, coughing.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttCan you hear?  Can you hear what they're
ttcelebrating?  I listened to you, Uncle.
ttSitting at your feet - always sitting at
ttsomebody's feet - trying to learn.  The
ttright way to hold a teacup, otherwise
ttyou're out, the pukkah knot in your tie -
ttas if everything can be explained in
ttterms of a cricket bat and an accent.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttKip -

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttKip! - it's not even my name because
ttyou can't say it.  Kirpal Singh Bhuller
ttis my name.

Hana runs in, alerted by the commotion, stunned by what she sees.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttWell, then ask him his name!

<b>tttHANA
</b>tttt(getting in between Kip and the Patient)
ttWhat's happened?  Kip!  What's happening?
ttDon't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttThey're excited!  They're happy about
ttdestroying a whole city.  Would they
ttdo that to a White Man's City?  Never!

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>tttt(pulling off the earphones)
ttGo on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttKip, listen, he lost everything because
tthe wasn't English - Jesus! - shoot me,
ttI'm more English than he is!

Kip levels the gun at the Patient.  Then breaks it open, throws it down 
on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to 
leak, some words audible - Eunola Gay... Hiroshima... and from 
different voices - It was beautiful!  just beautiful!  Bang! the 
biggest bang you ever saw!


<b>196tEXT.    KIP'S TENT.    LATE DAY.
</b>
Hana approaches.  Kip is inside the tent, the flap zipped.  She sees 
his shadow move, then freeze as she calls his name.  It's like a 
confessional.  The flap between them, the man in shadows, Hana 
crouched, forlorn.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttKip.  Kip.  It's me.
tttt(no response)
ttWhy?  It's another bomb.  However
ttbig, what's the difference?  There've
ttbeen so many bombs.  What about
ttCoventry?  What about Dresden?
ttWhere were those cities?
tttt(no response)
ttI don't understand.  Let me come in.

The shadow doesn't move.  Hana is at a loss.


<b>197tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.
</b>
The Patient becomes aware of something in the room, opens his eyes, 
squints into the darkness and sees A FIGURE hovering against the wall.  
He's in the Cave, he thinks, he's seeing the painted figures moving, 
he's seeing the Swimmer.

KIP - bare chested, no turban, hair loose - stands in the shadows at 
the foot of the Patient's bed.


<b>198tINT.    HANA'S ROOM.    EVENING.
</b>
Kip comes into the room.  Hana sits in the corner.  She is nervous of 
him, his look, his intensity.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttWill you come with me?

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttOf course.  When?

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttI mean home.  India.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttKip... I -

<b>tttKIP 
</b>tttt(interrupting this)
ttI know - here I am always a brown man,
ttthere you would be always a white woman.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttIs that what you think?  Is that what
ttyou think I think?

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttIt's what I've learned.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI'm thinking about your heart, not
ttyour skin.  And how to reach it.  And
ttthat I don't think I can.  A bomb
tthas ruined us, just not the bomb
ttI thought would ruin us.

She stands, goes to him.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI've clung to you.  I've clung to you.
ttKip.  Life  a raft.  

<b>tttKIP 
</b>tttt(clinging to her)
ttThen come with me.


<b>199tEXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.
</b>
Next morning and Kip has attached what he was making in the forge - A 
NEW HANDLE - to the pump.  Now he works it, producing a steady stream 
of water.  His motorbike is against the wall.  He goes to it.  
Caravaggio is watching.  He hugs Kip, wrapping his arms around the boy 
like a bear.


199a*.tEXT.    HANA'S VEGETABLE GARDEN.    DAY.

HANA stands by her Vegetable Garden.  Kip stops the motorbike.  She 
goes to him, stands, FASTENS THE TOP BUTTON of his coat.  You feel she 
might jump on the seat behind him.  But she doesn't.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI'll always go back to that church.
ttLook at my painting.

<b>tttKIP
</b>ttI'll always go back to that church.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttSo one day we'll meet.

He nods, winds up the throttle, and is gone.


<b>200tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
</b>
Hana comes in carrying FLOWERS and sets them down on the table next to 
a clutch of MORPHINE AMPOULES.  She picks up the hypodermic to prepare 
his injection.  She takes a phial.  THE PATIENT REACHES OUT AND PUSHES 
<b>TWO MORE TOWARDS HER.   THEIR EYES MEET, THEN HE SHOVELS ANOTHER, THEN 
</b>ALL OF THEM.  She looks at him.  IT'S A MASSIVE, LETHAL DOSE.

Hana starts to prepare the injection, her eyes filling with tears.  The 
Patient nods, smiles, whispers.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttThank you.  Thank you.

She kisses him, gently on the mouth.  He closes his eyes.

<b>tttTHE PATIENT
</b>ttRead to me, will you?  Read me to sleep.


<b>201*.tEXT.(NEAR THE) BASECAMP. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. 1942. DAY.
</b>
The familiar cleft in the rocks.  A PLANE is coming in to land.


<b>202tINT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.
</b>
A flashlight flickers in the cave.  ALMxc1SY APPEARS.

KATHARINE'S CORPSE lies where he left her - a ghost on a bed of silk 
and blankets.  The chill of the cave has preserved her.  She could be 
asleep.  She clutches the Herodotus.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttKatharine, my darling.

He sobs, whispering to her.  He's terribly cold, exhausted.  He slips 
underneath the covers to be next to her, and closes his eyes.

<b>tttALMxc1SY
</b>ttI'm so tired.


<b>203*.tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
</b>
The Patient is slipping away.  Hana is reading from the last pages of 
the Herodotus where KATHARINE HAS WRITTEN IN THE MARGINS.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttMy darling, I'm waiting for you - how
ttlong is a day in the dark, or a week?

The Patient looks across AND WHAT HE SEES IS KATHARINE BESIDE HIM IN 
<b>THE BED, SMILING, STROKING HIS HEAD, SPEAKING TO HIM.
</b>

<b>204tINT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.
</b>
Katharine is writing.  The FLASHLIGHT is faint.  She shivers.

<b>tttKATHARINE (O/S)
</b>tt...the fire is gone now, and I'm
tthorribly cold.  I really ought to
ttdrag myself outside but then
ttthere would be the sun...

She passes the flashlight across the wall, the painted figures dancing 
in the pale light.

<b>tttKATHARINE (O/S)
</b>ttI'm afraid I waste the light on the 
ttpaintings and on writing these words...


<b>205tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
</b>
THE BED IS EMPTY, THE MATTRESS STRIPPED.  Hana stands in the doorway, 
then sees THE HERODOTUS on the bedside table.

She picks it up, goes to the page of Katharine's letter, continues to 
read.

<b>tttKATHARINE (O/S)
</b>ttWe die, we die rich with lovers and
tttribes, tastes we have swallowed...


<b>206*.tEXT.    LANE OUTSIDE THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.
</b>
Caravaggio is at the gate to the Monastery.  The TRUCK we saw before is 
waiting with him.  The PARTISAN with his head bandana and shotgun 
remains the same, but now there are CHILDREN in the back and a WOMAN 
sits behind the man, nursing a two-year-old.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttHana!  Come on!

He gets up into the BALUSTRADE, tentatively finds his balance, then 
starts to walk, heel to toe - slowly, and then with more confidence - 
along the long thin line of stone.  The children watch intently.  He 
turns and bows.

<b>tttKATHARINE (O/S)
</b>tt...bodies we have entered and swum up
ttlike rivers, fears we have hidden in
ttlike this wretched cave...


<b>207*.tEXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.
</b>
Hana walks across the cloisters, passing the chalked hopscotch squares, 
leaving it all behind.  Then she stops, bends, retrieves A SNAIL SHELL, 
keeps going.  KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES.


<b>208tINT.    THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.
</b>
ALMxc1SY SMUDGES KATHARINE'S PALE FACE WITH COLOR.  OCHRE across her 
brow, BLUE on her eyelids, RED on her lips.  He presses his cheek to 
hers, smoothes her hair.

<b>tttKATHARINE (O/S)
</b>tt...I want all this marked on my body.
ttWe are the real countries, not the
ttboundaries drawn on maps with the
ttnames of powerful men...


<b>209*.tEXT.    THE LANE OUTSIDE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.
</b>
KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES.  Hana comes out to the truck, carrying her 
small bundle.  Caravaggio effects some introduction, beginning with the 
woman driver, Gioia.  She and Caravaggio smile like lovers.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttHana - this is Gioia.

Gioia smiles, shakes her hand.  Then Hana meets the others - Gioia's 
brother and wife, their children.   She smiles at them.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttBuon' giorno.

<b>tttCARAVAGGIO
</b>ttShe can take you as far as Florence.

<b>tttHANA
</b>ttI can get in the back.

And she clambers up, sits down between the children.  They exchange 
some small stiff, shy smiles, and then the truck bounces away.  Hana 
takes one final look at the Monastery as it disappears around the bend 
and then turns and confronts the life insisting noisily in the truck.


<b>210tEXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.
</b>
Almxe1sy comes out of the cave, carrying the bundle of Katharine in his 
arms, wrapped in the silks of her parachute.

<b>tttKATHARINE (O/S)
</b>tt...I know you will come and carry me
ttout into the palace of winds, the rumors
ttof water... That's all I've wanted -
ttto walk in such a place with you, with
ttfriends, on earth without maps.


<b>211tEXT.    TIGER MOTH.    DAY.

THE PLANE growls and complains into the air.


<b>212tINT.    TIGER MOTH.    DAY.
</b>
INSIDE THE COCKPIT:  THE COUPLE AS AT THE FRONT OF THE FILM.  Almxe1sy 
obliterated by goggles and helmet.  Katharine behind him, slumped 
forwards as if sleeping.

Almxe1sy banks across the plateau of the Gilf Kebir and glances down.  In 
a ravine is a sudden OASIS OF WHITE ACACIAS.  He is mesmerized.

And then it's gone and he passes into the earth without maps - the 
desert - as it stretches out for mile after mile.

<b>tttKATHARINE (O/S)
</b>ttThe lamp's gone out and I'm writing
ttin the darkness...

Almxe1sy, the English Patient, begins to sing - Szerelem, Szerelem - 
until that also fades and is replaced by the woman's tender lament 
heard at the beginning of the film, singing for all that has been lost.

The sound of gun fire...
