<b>THE DEAD
</b>(The working draft 1977)
by George A. Romero


1tWe see the face of a young woman. She is asleep. It is very
tquiet at first, as credits appear. The woman's face begins to
ttwitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly
tand her expression grows more desperate.

tA mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in. As they get louder, we
tcan discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually
ta frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national
temergency.

tThe woman's moans get louder and more desperate as the
tbackground sounds reach full volume and the credits stop. The
twoman sits up, snapping awake.

2tShe lurches forwards into the arms of a strong young man. She is
tFrancine, twenty three years old and very attractive, although
tshe is gritty with dirt. Her hair is hanging, dishevelled and
tsweaty. Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days.

tShe is sitting on the floor, where she has slept the last
tseveral hours, covered by an old overcoat.

tTony:tYOU OK?

tFran stares at the young man. She is shaking. She doesn't speak.

tTony:tTHE SHIT'S REALLY HITTING THE FAN.

tThe girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to
twhere others sleep on the floor. He wakes them up one at a time.
tWe begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio. They
thave an electronic tinniness, as broadcast over a monitor. Fran
tlooks about. She is still shaken from her dream.

3tWe see the television studio. Reporters buzz about madly.
tEverybody looks dishevelled and exhausted. Technicians man
tmonitors, and we see people on the little screens, arguing
temotionally.

4tVoice:tWHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN? WHAT THE HELL
<b>tttDIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, WHAT'S MAKING IT
</b><b>tttHAPPEN.
</b>
tVoice:tYES, BUT THAT'S...

tVoice:tTHAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STUDY. THEY'RE TRYING...

tVoice:tBUT IF WE KNEW THAT, WE COULD...

tVoice:tWE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE DON'T KNOW THAT!
<b>tttWE'VE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW!
</b>
5tThe room is pandemonium. People run in with wire copy; others
torganise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive. Others trip
tover cables and generally get in each other's way.

6tFrancine stares at the madness, still trying to clear her head.

tMan's voice: I'M STILL DREAMING.

tFran turns her head. Another young man sits next to her on the
tfloor. He is one of the ones Tony awakened.

tFran:tNO YOU'RE NOT.

tWoman:tMY TURN WITH THE COAT.

tFran looks up. A young woman is offering her coffee in a paper
tcup. She is next in line for the overcoat and a few hours sleep.
tFran takes the coffee and struggles to her feet.

tWoman:tTHE GUYS ON THE CREW ARE GETTING CRAZY.
<b>tttA BUNCH OF 'EM FLEW THE COOP ALREADY.
</b><b>tttI DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE'LL BE ABLE
</b><b>tttTO STAY ON AIR.
</b>
7tFran staggers over to the control consoles. The technicians are
tat the end of their ropes.

tTechnicians: (all at once)
<b>tttWATCH CAMERA TWO...WHO THE HELL'S ON CAMERA
</b><b>tttTWO, A BLIND MAN...
</b><b>tttWATCH THE FRAME...WATCH THE FRAME...
</b><b>tttROLL THE RESCUE STATIONS AGAIN.
</b>
tTechnicians: WE GOT A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE
<b>tttSTATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT.
</b><b>tttSO GET ME A NEW LIST.
</b><b>tttSURE, I'LL PULL IT OUTA MY ASS.
</b>
tFran focuses on the monitors. She is incredulous... stunned by
tthe madness which surrounds her. She realises the hopelessness
tof the situation as she zeroes in on the televised conversation.

8tWe begin to listen over the din of the news room.

tTV Man 1:    I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DOCTOR, AND I DON'T
<b>tttBELIEVE...
</b>
tTV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
<b>tttLIFE?
</b>
tTV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO...

tTV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
<b>tttLIFE AND ATTACKING THE LIVING?
</b>
tTV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE DOCTOR!

9tSuddenly we cut into the studio, and we see the argument as it
tis being shot.

tTV Man 1:    (con't)
<b>tttALL WE GET IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE TELL US.
</b><b>tttAND IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE...
</b>
tTV Man 2:    IT'S FACT... IT'S FACT...

tTV Man 1:    IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE WITHOUT YOU
<b>tttCOMING IN HERE AND TELLING US WE HAVE TO
</b><b>tttFORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY AND...
</b>
tTV Man 2:    HUMAN DIG... YOU CAN'T...

tTV Man 1:    ...FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY...

tTV Man 2:    YOU'RE NOT RUNNING A TALK SHOW HERE, MR.
<b>tttBERMAN...YOU CAN FORGET PITCHING AN AUDIENCE
</b><b>tttTHE MORAL BULL SHIT THEY WANT TO HEAR!
</b>
tTV Man 1:    YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABANDONING EVERY HUMAN
<b>tttCODE OF BEHAVIOUR, AND THERE'S A LOT OF US
</b><b>tttWHO AREN'T READY FOR THAT DOCTOR FOSTER...
</b>
10t A great cry of assent goes up from the studio floor. Doctor
tFoster is flustered and frustrated. The stage hands and
tcameramen are all screaming at him, swearing and ridiculing. We
tnotice Police guards, armed, at the studio doors. They control
tthe traffic in and out of the big room.

11t Back at the control panel. Fran stares at the screens. Confusion
tstill reigns.

tMan:t FRANNIE, GET ON THE NEW LIST OF RESCUE STATIONS.
<b>tttCHARLIE'S RECEIVING ON THE EMERGENCIES...
</b>
tFran pulls herself away from the monitors as the argument rages
ton screen.

12t She fights through the heavy traffic and reaches Charlie, a
tharassed typist who holds the receiver of an emergency radio
tunit under his chin...

tCharlie:t(into receiver)
<b>tttSAY AGAIN...CAN'T HEAR YOU... 
</b>
tFran:tRESCUE STATIONS?

tFran leafs through sheets of paper on Charlie's desk. He writes
tnotes as he listens on the receiver, and he speaks to the woman.

tCharlie:tHALF THOSE ARE INOPERATIVE ANY MORE.
<b>tttI'M TRYIN' TO FIND OUT AT LEAST ABOUT THE
</b><b>tttIMMEDIATE AREA. WE'VE HAD OLD INFORMATION
</b><b>tttON THE AIR FOR THE LAST TWELVE HOURS.
</b>
tFran:tTHESE ARE RESCUE STATIONS. WE CAN'T SEND
<b>tttPEOPLE TO INOPERATIVE...
</b>
tCharlie:t(into receiver)
<b>tttSAY AGAIN, NEW HOPE...
</b>
tCharlie makes more notes and hands them to Fran. Still listening
ton the receiver, he speaks to the woman again.

tCharlie:tI'M DOIN' WHAT I CAN. THESE ARE DEFINITE
<b>tttAS OF NOW. SKIP AND DUSTY ARE ON THE RADIO,
</b><b>tttTOO. GOOD LUCK.
</b>
tFran snatches up the sheets and moves across the room.

13t She stops at the consoles...

tFran:tI'M GONNA KNOCK OFF THE OLD RESCUE STATIONS.
<b>tttI'LL HAVE THE NEW ONES READY AS SOON AS I CAN.
</b>
tTechnician:  WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE TO PLACES THAT HAVE
<b>tttCLOSED DOWN. I'M GONNA KILL THE OLD LIST.
</b>
14t Fran moves toward another control room. An armed officer stops
ther. A young man rushing through with copy intercedes.

tMan:t HEY, SHE'S ALRIGHT.

tOfficer:tWHERE'S YOUR BADGE?

tFran reaches instinctively for the lapel of her blouse. Her
tbadge is missing.

tFran:tJESUS!

tMan:t SHE'S ALRIGHT.

tFran:tI HAD IT...I WAS ASLEEP OVER THERE...

tShe makes a move toward the corner where she was asleep.

tMan:t SOMEBODY STOLE IT. THERE'S A LOT OF 'EM
<b>tttMISSING.
</b>ttt(to officer)
<b>tttSHE'S ALRIGHT. LET HER THROUGH.
</b>
tThe officer reluctantly steps aside.

15t The young man and Fan move down a crowded hall and into a small
tcamera room. The foot traffic is solid. They talk as they walk.

tFran:tI DON'T BELIEVE IT.

tMan:t ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BADGES CAN OPEN A LOT
<b>tttOF DOORS...YOU AVOID A LOT OF HASSLES IF
</b><b>tttYOU GOT A BADGE...ANY KIND OF BADGE...
</b>
tFran:tIT'S REALLY GOING CRAZY.

16t They reach a small camera installation. The camera is aimed at a
tmachine which rolls out a list of rescue stations. The list is
tsuperimposed over the live broadcast as it goes out.

tCameraman:   YOU GOT NEW ONES?

tFran:tI GOTTA TYPE 'EM UP. KILL THE OLD ONES.

tCameraman:   GIVENS WANT 'EM...

tFran:tKILL 'EM, DICK. TELL GIVENS TO SEE ME!

tThe man clicks off his camera. Fran moves toward the studio.

17t On the monitors, we see the rescue stations blink off over shots
tof the two men who still argue on the air.

tTV Man 1:    WELL I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, DOCTOR.

tTV Man 2:    THESE ARE NOT GHOSTS. NOR ARE THESE HUMANS!
<b>tttTHESE ARE DEAD CORPSES. ANY UN-BURIED HUMAN
</b><b>tttCORPSE WITH ITS BRAIN INTACT WILL IN FACT
</b><b>tttRE-ACTIVATE. AND IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF
</b><b>tttINCITEMENT BY IRRESPONSIBLE PUBLIC FIGURES
</b><b>tttLIKE YOURSELF THAT THIS SITUATION IS BEING
</b><b>tttDEALT WITH IRRESPONSIBLY BY THE PUBLIC AT
</b><b>tttLARGE!
</b>
18t Another outraged cry goes up from the stagehands and observers.
tDoctor Foster tries to out-scream the cries...

tTV Man 2:    YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED...YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED...
<b>tttFOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS...WHAT DOES IT TAKE...
</b><b>tttWHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE?
</b>
19t Fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters
targue. The commotion is maddening. Fran stares for a moment.

20t TV Man 2:    (now distraught...almost pleading)
<b>tttTHIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE. PEOPLE
</b><b>tttMUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT.
</b><b>tttIT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT...WITH FRIENDS...
</b><b>tttWITH FAMILY...BUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE-
</b><b>tttACTIVATED BY EITHER DESTROYING THE BRAIN
</b><b>tttOR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE
</b><b>tttBODY.
</b>
tAnother outburst in the studio.

tTV Man 2:    THE SITUATION MUST BE CONTROLLED...BEFORE IT'S
<b>tttTOO LATE...THEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY...
</b>
21t Fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and
tfinally reaches another emergency radio installation. Skip and
tDusty are trying to listen to their receivers. They jot notes.

tFran:tOPERATIVE RESCUE STATIONS?

tDusty:tTHEY'RE DROPPIN' LIKE FLIES. HERE'S A FEW.
<b>tttYOU KNOW, I THINK FOSTER'S RIGHT. I THINK
</b><b>tttWE'RE LOSIN' THIS WAR.
</b>
tFran:tYEAH, BUT NOT TO THE ENEMY.
<b>tttWE'RE BLOWIN' IT OURSELVES.
</b>
tShe gives the rest of her coffee to the two men.

tFran:tNOT MUCH LEFT, BUT HAVE A BALL.

tThe two men each slug eagerly from the paper cup. Fran rushes
toff toward a large teleprompter typing machine.

22t The broadcasters still argue emotionally.

tTV Man 1:    PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR SOLUTIONS,
<b>tttDOCTOR, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM.
</b>
tTV Man 2:    EVERY DEAD BODY THAT IS NOT EXTERMINATED
<b>tttBECOMES ONE OF THEM! IT GETS UP AND KILLS!
</b><b>tttTHE PEOPLE IT KILLS GET UP AND KILL!
</b>
23t Handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter
ttypist, Fran rushes back toward the control room.

24t Around the monitor consoles, the commotion has been made even
tmore frantic by an angered Dan Givens, obviously one of the
tstation managers.

tGivens:t NOBODY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT, I WANT...

tGivens spots Fran as she moves into the room.

tGivens:t GARRET, WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL THE SUPERS?

tFran:tNOBODY. I KILLED 'EM. THEY'RE OUT OF DATE.

tGivens:t I WANT THOSE SUPERS ON THE AIR ALL THE TIME.

tFran:tARE YOU WILLING TO MURDER PEOPLE BY SENDING THEM
<b>tttOUT TO STATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN?
</b>
tGivens:t WITHOUT THOSE RESCUE STATIONS ON SCREEN EVERY
<b>tttMINUTE PEOPLE WON'T WATCH US. THEY'LL TUNE OUT.
</b>
tFran stares at the red faced man in disbelief.

tGivens:t I WANT THAT LIST UP ON THE SCREEN EVERY MINUTE THAT
<b>tttWE'RE ON THE AIR.
</b>
tFran is about to say something in anger, but before she can, one
tof the technicians, having overheard Givens, gets up from the
tcontrol panel and starts to walk away.

tGivens:t LUCAS...LUCAS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING...
<b>tttGET ON THAT CONSOLE...LUCAS...WE'RE ON THE AIR!
</b>
tLucas:tANYBODY NEED A RIDE!

25t Two other men from various positions in the room snatch up
tpersonal effects and follow the technician toward the door. The
tdoor is guarded by a nervous Officer.

26t Givens:t OFFICER...OFFICER...YOU STOP THEM...STOP THOSE
<b>tttMEN...LUCAS...GET BACK ON THIS CONSOLE...
</b>
tA frantic hubbub begins over the lack of console control. People
trush in and out, the floor director's voice can be heard over a
ttalk back system...

tVoices:t WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON IN THERE.
<b>tttSWITCH...SWITCH...THERE'S NO SWITCHER...
</b><b>tttWE'RE LOSING PICTURE...
</b>
tGivens:t OFFICER...STOP THOSE MEN...
<b>t 
</b>27t The young officer faces the men as they reach his post. He takes
ta grip on his rifles, opens the door and lets the group through.
tThen he runs out himself, deserting the losing cause.

28t Givens jumps toward the console. He frantically tries to work
tthe complex dials and pots...

tGivens:t GET SOMEBODY IN HERE THAT KNOWS HOW TO RUN
<b>tttTHIS THING...COME ON...I'LL TRIPLE THE MONEY
</b><b>tttFOR THE MAN THAT CAN RUN THIS THING...TRIPLE
</b><b>tttTHE MONEY...WE'RE STAYING ON THE AIR...
</b>
tFran moves slowly off toward the studio.

29t In the big room, the tension is thicker than ever. A few of the
tnewsmen still earnestly try to perform their various functions,
tbut most of the crew are reduced to emotional polarisation over
tthe broadcast which still rages.

30t TV Man 2:    THEY KILL FOR ONE REASON.
<b>tttTHEY KILL FOR FOOD.
</b><b>tttTHEY EAT THEIR VICTIMS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
</b><b>tttMR. BERMAN. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING.
</b>
31t Fran stops to listen to the argument. She falls back into the
tshadows of the studio. People rush past her, some leaving the
tstudio in disgust.

32t TV Man 2:    IF WE'D LISTENED...IF WE'D DEALT WITH THE
<b>tttPHENOMENON PROPERLY...WITHOUT EMOTION...
</b><b>tttWITHOUT...EMOTION...
</b><b>tttIT WOULDN'T HAVE COME TO THIS!
</b>
tFoster wipes his sweat with a dirty hanker chief. He pulls his
ttie away from his tight collar, and pops the shirt button open.
tHe is desperate now, shivering with anger and frustration.

tTV Man 2:    THERE IS A MARTIAL LAW STATE IN EFFECT IN
<b>tttPHILADELPHIA...AS IN ALL OTHER MAJOR CITIES IN
</b><b>tttTHE COUNTRY...
</b><b>tttCITIZENS MUST UNDERSTAND THE...DIRE...DIRE
</b><b>tttCONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON...SHOULD WE
</b><b>tttBE UNABLE TO CHECK THE SPREAD...
</b><b>tttBECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL ATTITUDES..OF THE
</b><b>tttCITIZENRY...TOWARD...THESE ISSUES OF...
</b><b>tttMORALITY...
</b><b>tttIT IS THE ORDER OF THE O.E.P. BY COMMAND OF THE
</b><b>tttFEDERAL GOVERNMENT...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
</b><b>tttUNITED STATES...
</b><b>tttCITIZENS MAY NO LONGER OCCUPY PRIVATE RESIDENCES,
</b><b>tttNO MATTER HOW SAFELY PROTECTED OR WELL STOCKED...
</b>
tA murmur in the studio begins to build to an emotional
tcrescendo. Foster tries to talk over the noise...

tTV Man 2:    CITIZENS WILL BE MOVED INTO CENTRAL AREAS OF
<b>tttTHE CITY...
</b>
33t Technicians abandon their posts. A few others jump in to take
ttheir places, but pandemonium reigns. A cameraman whips off his
theadset and breaks for the door. His camera spins on its liquid
thead, and on the monitors, we see a whirling blur as Foster
tcontinues to speak.

tFran moves quickly for the spinning camera. She aims it back at
tthe sweating Foster, and she stares through the viewfinder not
tbelieving what she is seeing.

34t TV Man 2:    THE BODIES OF THE DEAD WILL BE DELIVERED OVER
<b>tttTO SPECIALLY EQUIPPED SQUADS OF THE NATIONAL
</b><b>tttGUARD FOR ORGANISED DISPOSITION...
</b>
35t Suddenly a man darts out of the bustling crowd and comes up
tquickly behind Fran.

tSteve:tFRANNIE...AT NINE O'CLOCK MEET ME ON THE ROOF.
<b>tttWE'RE GETTING OUT.
</b>
tFran:t(letting the camera slip slightly)
<b>tttSTEPHEN...I DON'T BELIEVE THIS...WHAT...
</b>
tSteve:tWE'RE GETTING OUT. IN THE CHOPPER.

tAnother technician steps over to take the camera from Fran.
tStephen talks more quietly in the other man's presence.

tSteve:tNINE P.M. ALRIGHT?

tFran:tSTEVE...WE CAN'T...WE'VE GOT TO...

tSteve:tWE'VE GOT TO NOTHING, FRAN. WE'VE GOT TO
<b>tttSURVIVE. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SURVIVE. NOW YOU
</b><b>tttCOULD BE UP THERE AT NINE. DON'T MAKE ME COME
</b><b>tttLOOKIN' FOR YA.
</b>
tStephen is gone in a flash. Fran nervously looks back at the
tcameraman. The argument still rages between Foster and Berman.
tThe cameraman, without taking his eye from the viewfinder,
tspeaks to Francine quietly and slowly.

tCameraman:   GO AHEAD. WE'LL BE OFF THE AIR BY MIDNIGHT
<b>tttANYWAY. EMERGENCY NETWORKS ARE TAKING OVER.
</b><b>tttOUR RESPONSIBILITY... IS FINISHED, I'M AFRAID.
</b>
36t It is dusk, and the city of Philadelphia is surprisingly quiet.
tWe see several large buildings. They are part of a low-income
thousing project, and their lack of grace is evident. They stand
tlike tombstones as the first stars appear in the navy blue sky.

37t Under cover of the growing darkness, activities of the S.W.A.T.
tUnit go unnoticed. Grappling hooks grab against the lip around
tthe roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building.
tMen in armour vests, clutching the latest in special weapons,
ttake position here and there about the development.

tOther men strategically place their cars and trucks in the court
tbelow.

38t On the roof, at an entrance to one of the building's fire
tstairs, Roger squats silently alongside three other team
tmembers. The men check their weapons. Roger looks at his watch.
tThe sweep hand reaches the 12...

tRoger:t(to himself) LIGHTS.

39t In an instant, large searchlights bathe the side of the
tbuilding. The troop commander, shielded with other Officers
tbehind a large truck, shouts through an electric bullhorn.

tCommander:   MARTINEZ...YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING...YOU KNOW WE
<b>tttHAVE THE BUILDING SURROUNDED...
</b>
tThe electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete
tcaverns between the buildings of the project. There are only a
tfew windows which glow with lights from inside. At the sound of
tthe bullhorn, the lights all blink out one at a time.

tCommander:   (not over the bullhorn)
<b>tttLITTLE BASTARD'S GOT 'EM ALL MOVED INTO ONE
</b><b>tttBUILDING...DUMB LITTLE BASTARD!
</b>
tSergeant:    LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO FIGHT US.

tCommander:   (on the bullhorn again)
<b>tttMARTINEZ...THE PEOPLE IN THIS PROJECT ARE YOUR
</b><b>tttRESPONSIBILITY...WE DON'T WANT ANY OF THEM HURT
</b><b>tttAND NEITHER DO YOU!
</b>
42t There is no sign of life in the building. The great concrete
tslab is silhouetted silently against the darkening sky.

43t Roger, and his team mates, crouch in readiness. The sound of the
tbullhorn rises to them easily and clearly.

tRoger:tI'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ...

tCommander:   (Bullhorn)
<b>tttI'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ...
</b><b>tttTURN OVER YOUR WEAPONS AND SURRENDER...
</b>
tRoger:tTHERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU...

tCommander:   THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU OR ANY OF YOUR
<b>tttPEOPLE...
</b>
tRoger:tYET.

tCommander:   THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ.

tRoger:tAND COUNTING.
ttt(he looks at his watch)

tThere is a long silence.

tRoger:tCOME ON, MARTINEZ!

tOne of the other S.W.A.T. team members is a big man, with a
trough and vicious looking face. He is WOOLEY, a hardened
tveteran, and a red neck of the first order.

tWooley:t YEAH, COME ON, MARTINEZ...SHOW YOUR GREASY
<b>tttLITTLE PUERTO RICAN ASS...SO I CAN BLOW IT OFF...
</b>
tRoger looks over at the big man. He is distressed at the pent up
tviolence in Wooley.

tWooley:t I'LL BLOW ALL THEIR ASSES OFF...LOW LIFE BASTARDS..
<b>tttBLOW ALL THEIR LITTLE LOW LIFE PUERTO RICAN AND
</b><b>tttNIGGER ASSES RIGHT OFF...
</b>
tRoger is greatly concerned. He looks at one of the other men, a
tyoung, smoothed faced rookie. The boy doesn't know now to react.
tHe is obviously nervous.

tRoger:tKEEP COOL. JUST DON'T POP OFF IN THERE WHEN WE
<b>tttGO IN.
</b>
tThe boy nods, grateful for a more human contact.

tWooley:t HOW THE HELL COME WE STICK THESE LOW LIFES
<b>tttIN THESE BIG ASS FANCY HOTELS ANYWAY? SHIT
</b><b>tttMAN. THIS' BETTER THAN I GOT. YOU AIN'T
</b><b>tttGONNA TALK 'EM OUTA HERE. YOU GOTTA BLOW
</b><b>ttt'EM OUT. BLOW THEIR ASSES!
</b>
tRoger:t(to the boy)
<b>tttYOU GONNA BE ALRIGHT?
</b>
tThe boy nods in the affirmative.

tWooley:t LET'S GET ON WITH IT. THIS IS A WASTE OF
<b>tttMY TIME!
</b>
44t CRASH! Without warning, the metal door to the fire stair bursts
topen and several figures rush out of the darkness. Shots are
tfired from hand guns. A bullet smashes through the skull of the
tyoung boy next to Roger. He falls against Roger with a pleading
texpression on his face.

tFigures charge this way and that. More gunfire. The other
tS.W.A.T. men dodge and dive for cover. Wooley opens fire with
this automatic weapon.

45t On the street, the Commander, hearing the gunfire, barks into
tthe bullhorn:

tCommander:   MOVE IN...MOVE IN...
<b>tttGODDAMMIT!
</b>
tSergeant:    (into walkie talkie)
<b>tttALL UNITS... FULL OPERATION!
</b>
46t On the roof, Roger struggles under the dead weight of the young
tman. He tries to free himself and his weapons. Shots ring out.

tA handful of Black and Puerto Rican youngsters charge about the
trooftop. Another S.W.A.T. patrol appears from behind a large
televator housing. The young civilians retreat. Several are mowed
tdown.

tAnother bullet smashes against the dead S.W.A.T. man's back.
tJust as Roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in
tthe chest, but his armour takes the impact. He is thrown back
toff balance, and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles
tover to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof
ttop.

tBefore he reaches the gun, he is cut off by the looming figure
tof one of the Black youths, pistol in hand. Roger freezes. The
tyoung man aims his hand gun, but hesitates. A sudden barrage of
tbullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of
tblood. It was Wooley's gun that killed him.

tWooley:t COME ON YOU DUMB BASTARDS...
<b>tttCOME AND GET 'EM...
</b>
tHe fires again and again, even though the skirmish is winding
tdown.

tRoger charges for his weapon, snatches it up, and runs for the
tcover of an incinerator housing. He startles a young civilian
twho was hiding there, trying to load his gun. The boy makes a
tbreak...

tRoger:tHOLD IT...

tThe boy freezes for a moment, then, thinking, breaks into a run
tacross the roof.

tRoger:tHOLD IT, KID...DON'T RUN OUT THERE!

tThe boy is mowed down in a crossfire.

47t Inside the building, other S.W.A.T. teams along with units of
tthe National Guard are crashing through hallways and breaking
tinto apartment units. People are herded into the halls where
tthey are held at gun point.

tSome men, although armed, surrender willingly. Others retaliate
tagainst the invading force, and little skirmishes develop on
tevery floor of the complex structure.

48t On the ground, the Commander barks into the bullhorn:

tCommander:   MASKS...

tSergeant:    (into walkie talkie)
<b>tttMASKS FOR GAS...MASKS FOR GAS.
</b>
49t Tear gas canisters crash through windows and the halls are
tfilled with clouds of gas. Civilians trying to escape, are
tchoked as they attempt to shoot their way out.

50t The teams on the roof charge down the fire stairs into the
tbuilding.

<b>tS.W.A.T. 1:  WORK YOUR WAY DOWN. A FLOOR AT A TIME.
</b><b>tttHOLD 'EM IN THE HALLS 'TIL WE CAN WORK 'EM
</b><b>tttDOWN THE STAIRS.
</b>
tRoger and Wooley and the men in their unit, snap on their
tbizarre looking gas masks.

51t The troopers break into an apartment on the floor. An old couple
tkneels in prayer at a small alter, while their children and
ttheir children's children huddle in a corner. The young husband
tsurrenders his gun to a trooper, and Roger watches as the group
tis led into the hallway.

tSuddenly, a young Black man charges out of one of the
tapartments. A woman appears at the door, screaming for him to
tstop. He breaks through a cloud of gas and Wooley fires his
tautomatic. The black man crashes to the floor. Wooley is crazed.
tHe kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly
tinto the room.

tThe flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the
thall. The younger ones try to escape while the older people
tkneel or fall against the walls praying.

<b>tS.W.A.T. 2:  WOOLEY'S GONE APE SHIT, MAN...
</b>
tRoger:tWOOLEY! (shouting)

tWooley kicks in the door of another apartment. Roger charges at
thim and grabs him around the shoulders. The big man resists. His
tgun fires and bullets fly wildly. He struggles against Roger,
tbut Roger manages to hold on.

tRoger:tGIMME A HAND...SOMEBODY...

tAnother S.W.A.T. Trooper steps up out of the cloud of gas. He is
tvery tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a
tdeep voice.

tTrooper:tSTEP AWAY FROM HIM.

tRoger:tGIMME A HAND.

tWooley throws his body around and slams Roger against the wall,
tbut Roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling
toff his gun at the open apartment door.

tRoger:tGODDAMMIT...HELP ME...HE'S CRAZY!

tTrooper:tSTEP AWAY FROM HIM!

tJust then, Wooley wrenches free and pushes Roger across the
thallway. The Trooper carefully aims his weapon and fires one
tshot through Wooley's head. The big man falls back violently.

tThe mysterious Trooper turns and hurries away down the hall.
tOther S.W.A.T. Officers face him threateningly. He stares at
tthem through his mask. They let him pass. He disappears through
tthe smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the
tcivilians.

tWomen scream and cry over their dead-loved ones. Roger is helped
tto his feet by another Officer. Roger's eyes are wide and
tstaring through the insect-like lenses of his mask. They are
tlocked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment
twhich Wooley kicked open. The other Trooper looks and his eyes
twiden as well.

53t In the apartment, lying in a pool of blood, are the partial
tremains of what was a human body. It has been ripped to shreds.

tRoger staggers against the door frame. The other trooper moves
tinside. Another corpse, also mutilated, one leg missing, one arm
tbadly mangled. It is trying to move. To reach the Troopers.

54t A sudden loud scream. Roger startles and spins around. A woman
tin the hall has seen the grisly sight, and she runs screaming
tdown the corridor. More confusion, as civilians push through the
tTroopers who try to hold them back.

55t The Trooper in the apartment is revulsed...

tTrooper:tJESUS...HOLY JESUS...

tA third officer enters the apartment. He speaks to the Trooper
twhich is closest to the writhing corpse on the floor.

tTrooper 2:   SHOOT IT...SHOOT IT THROUGH THE HEAD.

tThe young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third
tOfficer pulls out his pistol. Then suddenly, from out of the
tshadows, a spectre-like figure lunges at the third Officer,
tflailing and biting at his arms. It is a wild-haired woman.
tThere are several bleeding wounds over her body. She is one of
tthe walking dead.

tThe Trooper struggles to free himself, and Roger darts into the
troom. Although the Zombie is weak, she manages to hold on to the
tTrooper.

tAnother creature suddenly appears in the bedroom doorway. A
tmale, it staggers out into the room. The young Trooper struggles
twith his holster trying to free his hand gun. Suddenly, he feels
tsomething on his leg. The dismembered corpse is clutching his
tankle, pulling itself closer, it's mouth open. The boy tries to
tpull away, but falls onto the floor, crashing over a table and
tlamp. He tries to crawl away, but the frail corpse keeps its
thold and drags along behind the young Trooper, who still cannot
tfree his pistol.

tRoger and the third Officer fling all their weight against the
twoman Zombie. She flies against a wall, but bounces back
timmediately, and attacks again. The third Trooper's rifle fires.
tA slug tears through the woman's chest but it doesn't stop her
tonslaught. Another shot rips through her neck. Still she comes.

tThe boy on the floor manages to level off his pistol. He fires
tat the ghoulish head which draws closer to his leg. The thing's
tskull blows open and its grasp relaxes. The boy is shaking
tviolently. His arm and gun stay in the air, still poised. He
tfires again...and again...and again.

56t In the hall, the male Zombie appears, and the crowd panics. The
tTroopers try to keep things calm.

<b>tS.W.A.T. 3:  IT'S ONE OF THEM...MY GOD...IT'S ONE OF THEM.
</b>
<b>tS.W.A.T. 4:  SHOOT FOR THE HEAD.
</b>
tWoman:tNO! NO! MIGUEL...DIOS MIO...MIGUELITO...

tThe woman pushes through the crowd. The Zombies advances. Before
tthe Trooper can stop her, the woman throws her arms around the
tcreature.

tWoman:tMIGUEL...MI VIDA...MIGUELITO...

<b>tS.W.A.T. 3:  GRAB HER...GET HER OUT OF THERE...
</b>ttt(his gun is levelled off, but he can't get a shot)

tThe Zombie clutches at the woman. It bites at her neck...her
tarm. She screams with terror. She tries to pull away, but the
tcreature holds her. It bites again. A Trooper comes up from
tbehind and tries to wrestle the creature away. Another Trooper
tgrabs the woman and tries to free her. She is screaming
tinsanely. The Zombie pulls another piece of flesh off her arm.

<b>tS.W.A.T. 3:  STAND CLEAR...FOR CHRISSAKE...STAND CLEAR!
</b>
57t In the apartment, the female Zombie lunges at the third Trooper
tand the two tumble to the floor. Roger wrestles her free and,
twith all his might, throws her against the wall. She advances
tagain. Roger raises his gun, She is just about to reach him. He
tfires. The bullet drops her.

58t In the hall, a Trooper brings his gun butt slamming against the
tmale ghoul's head. The creature loses his grip on the screaming
twoman. The Trooper who is holding her, pulls her free across the
tfloor. S.W.A.T. 3 fires. The bullet tears through the Zombie's
tshoulder...another shot...through his neck...another...through
tthe skull. It falls.

59t There is finally a calm. A few of the citizens murmur prayers.
tTroopers and befuddled old people seem to drift through the
tclouds of gas in a totally dazed state.

60t Roger and the third Trooper from the apartment drift to the
thallway. The third Trooper moves into the crowd, but Roger
tstands against the open door jamb for a moment.

tA sudden, loud gunshot makes Roger duck and spin around. He
tlooks into the apartment. The young Trooper has shot himself
tthrough the head.

61t In the dark firestair, it is very quiet. Roger bursts through a
tmetal door from one of the halls and falls against the stair
trailing. He is retching. He breathes heavily to contain himself.
tHe removes his mask and coughs slightly from the gas mist which
tstill clings in the air.

tVoice:tYOU'RE NOT ALONE BROTHER.

tRoger tightens, grabbing for his gun. The voice is present; very
tnearby. Roger looks up. Sitting on the stairs above is the
tTrooper who shot Wooley. His rifle is aimed at Roger.

tVoice:tYOU WAS IN WOOLEY'S UNIT.

tRoger:tI DIDN'T SEE NOTHIN.
<b>tttI DIDN'T SEE HOW HE DIED.
</b>
tRoger slings his rifle, so the Trooper relaxes and lowers his
tgun. He removes his gas mask. He is Black.

tRoger:tYOU RUNNIN?

tThe Black man shrugs. He hasn't decided.

tRoger:tI DON'T JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF WOOLEY.
<b>tttI JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF...
</b>
tVoice:tYEAH. I KNOW.

tRoger:tTHERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNIN'.
<b>tttI COULD RUN.
</b>
tRoger stares up at the grim faced Black.

tRoger:tI COULD RUN RIGHT TONIGHT.

tThe black man just stares levelly into Roger's eyes.

tRoger:tFRIEND OF MINE GOT A HELICOPTER. HE DOES
<b>tttTRAFFIC FOR J.A.S. GOT A HELICOPTER AND HE'S
</b><b>tttRUNNIN' OUT WITH IT. AS'T ME T'COME.
</b>
tThe Black man smiles.

tRoger:tYOU THINK IT'S RIGHT TO RUN?

tThe Black man shrugs again, then he stands and walks down the
tstairs. HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down
tinto the lingering gas mist. Roger follows.

62t A few landings down...a noise. The two Troopers freeze. The
tstairwell is dark. The noise grows louder. The Troopers ready
ttheir weapons.

tThe sounds are little scraping thumps, like the weary foot falls
tof someone...something...trying to negotiate the stairs...There
tis the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath.

tThe men stare at the landing below. The Black man steps forward
tslightly, trying not to make a sound.

tSuddenly, a figure pops out of the darkness. It falls against
tthe wall below. Both Troopers raise their guns. The figure pulls
taway from the wall. In the mist, it's shape is ghostly...
trobed...in black...is sees the Troopers...

tFigure:t SENORES...
<b>tttPLEASE TO LET ME PASS...
</b>
tThe voice weakens into a low wheezing cough. The figure slumps
tand sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. It is an old
tPriest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish.

tRoger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his
tbreath. He is weary. He seems to be near death. He clutches at
this chest.

tRoger tries to support him.

tRoger:tLET'S GET HIM TO THE MEDICS...

tPriest:t NO...NO...NO...PLEASE. JUST...LET
<b>tttME PASS...MY SISTER...I GO UP TO SEVEN
</b><b>tttFLOOR...TO FIND MY SISTER...
</b>
tRoger:tTHEY'RE TAKIN' EVERYONE DOWN...THEY PROBABLY
<b>tttBROUGHT HER DOWN...COME ONE...
</b>
tPriest:t MY SISTER...SHE IS DEAD...THEY TELL ME...
<b>tttTHE DEAD THEY DO NOT BRING DOWN.
</b>
tRoger and the Black Trooper shoot glances at one another.

tPriest:t JUST LET ME PASS. MARTINEZ IS DEAD.
<b>tttTHE PEOPLE OF 107 WILL DO WHAT YOU
</b><b>tttWISH NOW. THESE SIMPLE PEOPLE...
</b><b>tttBUT STRONG...THEY HAVE LITTLE...BUT THEY
</b><b>tttDO NOT GIVE IT UP EASILY. AND THEY GIVE
</b><b>tttUP THEIR DEAD...TO NO ONE!
</b>
tThe Priest goes into a coughing fit. The Troopers look on. Roger
twants to help in some way.

tPriest:t MANY HAVE DIED ON THESE STREETS IN THE LAST
<b>tttWEEKS...IN THE BASEMENT OF THIS BUILDING
</b><b>tttYOU FIND THEM...
</b>
tThe Troopers are shocked. The Priest struggles to his feet.

tPriest:t I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LAST RITES.
<b>tttNOW...YOU DO WHAT YOU WILL...
</b>
tThe old man starts up the stairs. Roger moves to help him, but
tthe big Black man stops him. The Priest weaves up through the
tgas mist, coughing.

tPriest:t YOU ARE STRONGER THAN US...BUT SOON, I
<b>tttTHINK...THEY BE STRONGER THAN YOU...
</b>
tThe old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears
tin the cloud...

tPriest:t WHEN THE DEAD WALK, SENORES...WE MUST
<b>tttSTOP THE KILLING...OR WE LOSE THE WAR...
</b>
63t In the basement of the large building, S.W.A.T. troopers pry at
tthe boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage
tarea.

tThe rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons
traised...high powered rifles...flame throwers...

tThe nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. The men are
tsilent, not knowing what to expect.

tThere are three boards left...then two...

tWith a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men
tremove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips
toff its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies
tpushes into the hall.

tThey are wide eyed and terrifying. In life, they were mostly
tBlacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They
tare all ages, from the very old to the very young.

tThe riot troops are stunned. They cannot react quickly enough,
tand the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is
timpossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring
tother troopers.

tThe men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. In the
tfront line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear
tinto arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush.

tCommander:   BACK OFF...BACK OFF...SPREAD OUT...

tThe rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass
tof struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some
tTroopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate
trounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by
tclutching ghouls.

tRoger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle.
tThey fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into
tlittle skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly
torganised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless
tonslaught.

64t As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage
tarea, several Troopers move into the room.

tThe walls are dank and grey. There is a dripping sound. All
taround lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and
tbicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and
tcartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture.

tAnd here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of
tcorpses. They have been eaten away. Most of them are still
tmoving, their heads uninjured.

tTwo of the Troopers retreat, revulsed. The sound of the gunfire
tand screaming can be heard from the hall.

tThe big Black man walks calmly into the room. Roger watches him.
tHe walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires
tcarefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. Tears
troll down his cheeks.

tSome of the creatures are without arms and legs. Some have been
teaten away about the neck and shoulder. They moan with a
tgurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move.

tA young Black Zombie, pulling itself along the floor with one
tarm, draws close to the Black Trooper. The big man aims his
tpistol. It clicks...empty. He quickly and efficiently reaches
tfor more ammunition and begins to reload. The Zombie pulls
tcloser, its mouth wide.

tRoger steps up behind the other Trooper and fires into the
tcreatures head with his automatic rifle.

tThe Black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load
tthe pistol.

tRoger disposes of several other creatures. he comes to a place
twhere several are piled together. Some lie still, others writhe
tabout. Two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are
teating at parts of other bodies. Roger shoots them. They never
tlook up. They don't seem to notice him at all.

tA loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly. Roger looks up.

65t In the ceiling, a double set of loading doors has been opened.
tSeveral other Troopers look down into the storage area.

tTrooper:tJESUS CHRIST.

tHe shines a light beam down towards Roger.

tTrooper:tYOU OK DOWN THERE?

64t Roger nods.

65t Trooper:tTHIS MUST BE WHERE THEY DUMPED 'EM IN.

64t Roger looks down at the pile of corpses beneath the opening.

65t Trooper:tYOU NEED MORE MEN?

64t Roger shakes his head "no".

65t Trooper:tJESUS CHRIST.

tThe trooper leaves the opening. He is replaced by two others who
tjust stare down into the storage room through the weird, round
tlenses of their masks.

66t The distant sounds of the battle in the hall flare up again. The
tbig Black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a
tfew steps forwards. He sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and
ttied securely with clothes line. It looks like a mummy. It is
twrithing, trying to free itself. he shoots it through the head.

tNearby, a small corpse, that of a very young child, is also
twrithing, but the end of the shroud, where the child's feet
tshould be, has been torn open and is bloody. A stump kicks
taround the blood where a foot has been eaten off. The Black man
tfires into the thing's head.

tRoger:tTHEY...ATTACK...EACH OTHER...

tBlack:tJUST THE FRESH CORPSES...BEFORE THEY REVIVE...

tRoger:tWHY DID THESE PEOPLE KEEP THEM HERE? WHY
<b>tttDON'T THEY TURN THEM OVER...OR...OR DESTROY
</b><b>tttTHEM THEMSELVES...IT'S INSANE...WHY DO THEY
</b><b>tttDO IT?
</b>
tBlack:t'CAUSE THEY STILL BELIEVE THERE'S
<b>tttRESPECT IN DYING.
</b>
tThe big man fires into the head of another squirming Zombie.

67t In the halls of the building, Troopers fall and are pounced on
tby ghouls. Other Troopers fire their automatics through the
theads of attacking Zombies. The riot troops try to stay
torganised, but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it
tis turning into a riot.

68AtThe buildings of Philadelphia loom in the moonlight. What few
tlights remain lit reflect in the waters of the Delaware.

68BtIt is quiet except for the slight sounds of lapping water and an
toccasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one
tanother.

tThere are a few big Police launches still docked in the marina.
tThey bob about silently. The chain, which normally restricted
tthe area, is broken and dangling. The sign, which reads: CITY OF
tPHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken
tchain in the wind.

tHalfway down the long dock is a little guard house. Inside,
tsitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed
tguard.

tNearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large
tsquare pattern. It is a landing bay for Police helicopters.
tAlongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a
tsmall fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper
tand launches.

tThe other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another
tofficer and a civilian. A bell buoy rings in the distance and we
tbegin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter.

tThe blades of the J.A.S. Traffic Copter whine as they gear down
tfor a landing. The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the
tgently bobbing heliport.

69t With the blades still spinning loudly, Stephen hops out of the
tcockpit.

tSteve:tCOME ON...I NEED YOU.

tFrancine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of
tthe machine. Steve runs, ducking under the blades, around to the
twoman's side of the cockpit, grabs her hand, and they make for
tthe fuel pumps.

tSteve:tI DON'T SEE ROGER. WE'LL GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES.

tFran:tOH MY GOD!

70t The woman freezes in mid stride, and her action brings Stephen's
teyes around to see what she is staring at. The two bodies which
tlie near the fuel pumps.

tSteve:tYOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN IT AT ALL.
<b>tttIT'S TOUGH TO GET USED TO IT.
</b>
tHe pulls her quickly along. They have to actually step over the
tcivilian corpse. Fran freezes again. She can't bring herself to
twalk over the body. Steve lets go of her hand and checking the
ttank gauge, he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back
tto Fran. The long hose is heavy, and it bobbles the civilian
tcorpse, almost rolling it over. The back of the bodies head has
tbeen blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet. Blood
tstill runs. The wound is fresh. Steve does not see this as he
ttugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with
tFran following.

71t At the side of the machine, the blades still spinning overhead,
tSteve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle. He
tpulls one of Fran's hands into the nozzle mechanism.

tSteve:tJUST LIKE THIS...LIKE A CAR...

tFran responds, getting the feel of the nozzle trigger.

tSteve:tTHAT'S IT...JUST HOLD HER THERE 'TIL SHE
<b>tttSPITS OUT AT YA.
</b>
tThe woman takes over and Stephen trots away toward the guard
tshed. The propeller blades still spin. They make an eerie,
twhispering sound as they pass over Fran's head. She can hear the
tlapping water now, and the creaking moans of the shifting docks.
tShe looks this way and that, fear in her eyes.

72t At the guard house, Stephen rushes in to find the dead radio
toperator. A signal is coming over the receiver in Morse Code.
tThe corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send
tkey. A small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the
tdead man's head. As Stephen pulls the body up to an erect
tposture in its chair, he sees that the exit of the bullet all
tbut obliterated the corpse's face. Again the wound is still
trunning and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the
tdesk and the radio unit.

tStephen clicks on the send switch and he quickly begins to send
ta message in Morse:

<b>tttOPERATOR DEAD...POST ABANDONED...
</b>
73t Back on the fuel dock, the long hose brushes over the civilian
tcorpse. A shadow moves nearby, making is aware of a presence
tother than Fran's.

74t The woman switches hands on the pump nozzle. The blades still
twhoosh overhead. Then she hears the sound of another engine. She
tlooks towards the mainland. The headlights of an approaching
tvehicle can be seen.

75t At the guard house, Stephen, hearing the approaching engine,
tsteps into the doorway and looks up the dock. He calls to Fran.

tSteve:tI HOPE IT'S ROGER.

76t Fran:tWHAT ARE YOU DOING?

tSteve:tI'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

77t He ducks back into the shed. He snatches up a First Aid Kit and
tthrows it into a khaki knapsack. He rummages in the darkness. He
tfinds a toolbox.

tAs he stands up, he backs into a tall figure which stands in the
tshadows. Feeling something sharp and hard against his back.
tSteve recoils and spins to face the figure. It is a uniformed
tofficer. His rifle is levelled off at Steve's chest. From out of
tthe shadows, a second Policeman appears with a hand gun cocked
tand aimed.

78t Fran's eyes strain to discern the approaching vehicle, but
tsuddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision.
tThrough the open sides of the helicopter bubble, she notices a
tPolice van. It has been there all along, it's doors flung wide
topen, as though abandoned hurriedly. Now one of the rear doors
tmove. A figure appears carrying a large packing carton. The
tfigure is uniformed, with two rifles strapped to its back. It
trushes toward the launch docks.

tVoice:tJUST STAY COOL.

tFran, already startled by the running figure, is now doubly
tshocked by the calm voice behind her. She spins and the fuel
tnozzle clatters out of it's receptacle to the wooden dock
tboards. She is facing another "Policeman", to aims a rifle
tdirectly at her head.

tOfficer 1:   IF YOU DIE...IT'LL BE YOUR OWN FAULT.

tThe Officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the
tGuard House.

tOfficer 2:   COME ON SKIPPER...THEY GOT FRIENDS COMIN'.

79t In the Guard House, Steve is held at bay by one of the Officers
twhile the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the
tprogress of the approaching vehicles.

tOfficer 3:   WHO ARE YOU?

tSteve:tWE'RE WITH J.A.S...WE...

tOfficer 4:   (at the door)
<b>tttABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF.
</b>ttt(referring to the arrival time of the vehicle)

tOfficer 3, the Skipper, pushes Steve with his gun barrel. Steve
tspins out through the open doorway. He looks up the dock and
tsees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is
talmost a mile long.

80t Officer 1 has moved around Fran and he reaches into the
thelicopter bubble pulling out Steve's rifle.

81t Steve:tNOW WAIT A MINUTE...WE'RE JUST HERE TO REFUEL...
<b>tttTHESE MEN WERE ALREADY DEAD...YOU WERE HERE...
</b><b>tttYOU KNOW THAT...IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WAS
</b><b>tttAFTER THE LAUNCHES...WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH...
</b>
tOfficer 3:   (looking at the insignia on the helicopter)
<b>tttHEY...J.A.S. TRAFFIC WATCH...
</b><b>tttSTEVE ANDREWS.
</b>
tSteve:t(trying to capitalise on his minor celebrity power)
<b>tttRIGHT...THAT'S ME...I'M STEVE ANDREW...
</b>
tOfficer 3:   NO SHIT.

82t Officer 1:   (shouting from the helicopter)
<b>tttWE'D GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD, SKIPPER.
</b>
83t Steve freezes again, sensing that these are not law enforcers.

84t The man who was carrying the carton is now rushing back up the
tdock having deposited his load in one of the motor launches.

tOfficer 2:   CAN'T ALL FIT.

85t Officer 3:   (directly to Stephen)
<b>tttHOW MANY WILL THAT THING HOLD?
</b>
tOfficer 4:   HEY, MAN, I AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE IN NOTHIN' I
<b>tttCAN'T DRIVER MYSELF!
</b>
86t Officer 2 has returned to the van and is carrying out another
tcarton rushing back to the launch.

tOfficer 2:   THAT'S TRUE...SOMETHIN' HAPPENS TO HIM AND
<b>tttWE'RE STUCK. STAY WITH THE LAUNCH!
</b>
tOfficer 1:   GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD!

87t Suddenly, above the two white headlights of the approaching
tvehicle, we see a third light in red. It is the spinning
t"bubble-gum-machine" of a Squad Car. It is heralded by one
tblast of the car's siren.

88t Officer 4:   HEY, THAT'S A BLACK AND WHITE!

89t Officer 1 still holds his rifle aimed at Fran.

tOfficer 1:   THEY SEEN US!

90t Officer 3:   IT'S ALRIGHT...WE'RE POLICE...

91t Officer 2 dumps his carton at the edge of the dock and pulls one
trifle from his back.

tOfficer 2:   BULL SHIT...LET'S GET TO THE BOAT!

92t Officer 3 stares hard at Stephen. Then at the Squad Car. Then
tback at the nervous young pilot.

tOfficer 3:   YOU'RE RUNNIN', AIN'T YOU, FLY BOY?

tSteve does not respond. He is terrified, not knowing what answer
tto be the safest.

tOfficer 3:   YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS IS RUNNIN' OFF IN THE
<b>tttJ.A.S. TRAFFIC BIRD...
</b>
tThe man starts to grin with knowing. He suddenly feels in more
tcontrol.

tOfficer 3: SIT TIGHT, BOYS...THEY'RE RUNIN', TOO.

93t It seems to take forever for the Police Car to pull down the
tdock. Stephen takes a few steps forward, squinting to see, but
the is threatened by the "Policeman's" gun barrels.

94t The car screeches to a stop and two armed S.W.A.T. Troopers
timmediately pop out of the front seat on either side. They are
tRoger and the Black Trooper.

tRoger:tWHAT'S THE PROBLEM, OFFICER?

95t Officer 3:   CAUGHT YOUR FRIENDS HERE STEALIN' COMPANY
<b>tttGASOLINE.
</b>
96t Roger:tWHAT DO YOU MEAN FRIENDS?

tRoger is trying to play dumb, assuming that the other Policemen
tare on official business...

97t Steve:tTHEY KNOW, ROG...
<b>tttTHEY'RE TRYIN' TO GET OUT, TOO.
</b>
tOfficer 3:   IT'D BE CRAZY TO START SHOOTIN' AT ONE
<b>tttANOTHER, NOW WOULDN'T IT?
</b>
98t Roger:tSURE WOULD.

99t Officer 1:   ALRIGHT, LET'S LOAD UP...

tHe slings his rifle and tosses the other gun back to Fran. She
tbobbles it and it falls, skittering across the dock.

tOfficer 1:   YOU BETTER LEARN HOW TO USE THAT THING, WOMAN.
<b>tttTIMES IS TENSE.
</b>
100tThe policemen start to unload crates and cartons from their Van.
tThe big Black Trooper pulls a few supplies from out of the squad
tcar and carries them toward the helicopter.

101tFran trots over toward Stephen. He is just coming back out of
tthe guardhouse where he picked up the toolbox and the knapsack
tfull of supplies. The woman falls into his arms. Roger trots up.

tRoger:tYOU OK?

tStephen:t(nods)
<b>tttWHO'S HE?
</b>ttt(referring to the big Black)

tRoger:tHIS NAME'S PETER. HE'S ALRIGHT.

tThe three are already moving toward the helicopter.

tRoger:tLET'S HUSTLE.

102tPeter has stowed the supplies in the rear of the cockpit, and he
thas noticed the fuel hose lying on the dock. He tries the nozzle
tin the receptacle on the chopper and holds it in until the tank
tfills.

103tThe other "Policemen" are still moving cartons of supplies from
ttheir van down the dock.

tRoger:t(to the other Policemen)
<b>tttYOU GUYS BETTER MOVE IT. THERE'S A RADIO
</b><b>tttREPORT ABOUT THE DOCK BEIN' KNOCKED OUT.
</b>
104tThey reach the cockpit. Fran climbs in and crouches on the floor
tin the rear of the bubble.

tFran:tYOU SURE THIS'LL CARRY US ALL.

tSteve:tLITTLE HARDER ON THE FUEL, BUT WE'LL BE OK.

105tAs Peter climbs aboard, one of the other policemen, carrying a
tfinal carton, speaks to Roger.

tOfficer 2:   HEY...YOU GOT ANY CIGARETTES.

tRoger looks at the others one at a time. Fran shakes her head
t"no".

tRoger:tSORRY. (he trots around to the passenger seat)

tSteve:tWHERE YA HEADED?

tOfficer 2:   DOWN RIVER...GOT AN IDEA MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT TO
<b>tttTHE ISLANDS.
</b>
tSteve:tWHAT ISLANDS? (he starts the engine)

tOfficer 2:   ANY ISLANDS...WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHERE YOU HEADED?

tSteve:tSTRAIGHT UP.

106tThe Policeman rushes off with his two cohorts. As they untie one
tof the launches from the dock, the J.A.S. helicopter whines
tloudly. Then it lifts off the dock with a smooth motion.

tThe Police launch starts without a problem, and it pulls out
tonto the dark river.

107tThe lights on the helicopter blink as the metal bird swoops low
tover the Philadelphia skyline. We see an empty city.
tIndependence Hall...Betsy Ross' House, which flies the original
tAmerican flag...the oldest American heritages stand coldly in
tthe night. The whirring engine fades overhead.

108tIn the cockpit, Fran lights a cigarette. So does Roger. No one
tcomments, but Peter smiles slightly.

tThe big Black looks down at the city.

tPeter:tANY OF YOU LEAVIN' PEOPLE BEHIND?

tFran:tAN EX-HUSBAND.

tRoger:tAN EX-WIFE.

tSteve:tYOU PETER?

tPeter:t(still looking down)
<b>tttSOME BROTHERS.
</b>
109tThe whirlybird cuts through the dark night sky. It flies over
topen country now, moving West. Some time has passed.

110tRoger is asleep in the passenger seat. Twisted in the cramped
trear of the cockpit, Fran and Peter sit very close to each
tother. Peter still stares off into the night.

tFran:tREAL BROTHERS?

tPeter looks at her. He has a strong face.

tFran:tREAL BROTHERS OR...STREET BROTHERS?

tPeter:tBOTH.

tFran:tHOW MANY REAL ONES?

tPeter:tTWO.

tFran:tTWO.

tPeter:tONE'S IN JAIL. THE OTHER'S A PRO BALL PLAYER.
<b>tttBUT WE CATCH UP TO EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE.
</b>
tFran doesn't quite know how to respond.

tPeter:t(nodding at Steve...the engine roars too loudly
tttfor the pilot to hear the conversation)
<b>tttHE YOUR MAN NOW?
</b>
tFran is taken off guard. She smiles slightly.

tFran:tMOST OF THE TIME, YEAH.

tPeter:tJUST LIKE TO KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS.

tFran:tYEAH. ME TOO.

111tLight downs on the horizon. The little helicopter chugs through
tthe shades of blue.

112tNow Fran is asleep and Roger still snores. Peter stares at the
tback of the pilot's head. Steve nods slightly, then shakes
thimself. Soon, he nods again...falling asleep. Peter kicks him
tin the shoulder.

tSteve looks back, surprised that the big man is awake. Peter
tjust stares at him.

tSteve rubs his face violently with his free hand. He pulls at
this lower eyelids.

tSteve:tANY MORE WATER?

tPeter reaches into the supplies and produces a plastic container
twith water. Steve slugs some of it and pours a little onto his
tface. Then he passes it back to Peter, who also drinks.

tSuddenly, Fran stiffens and wakes up with a start. Peter looks
tover at her with a gentle expression. She takes a moment to
torient herself.

tPeter:t(to Stephen)
<b>tttYOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?
</b>
tSteve:tI KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE.

tPeter:tHARRISBURG?

tSteve:tPASSED IT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

tRoger finally wakes up from the loud talking.

tSteve:tWE'RE PRETTY LOW ON FUEL. I'M JUST WAITIN'
<b>tttFOR FULL LIGHT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE
</b><b>tttLANDIN' IN.
</b>
113tIn the morning light, several fires can be seen on the ground,
twhere buildings are burning.

114tThe chopper flies over a National Guard convoy as it chugs up a
twinding country road.

115tHere and there on the ground, human activity can be seen. Search
tand Destroy units, made up of Police, Guardsmen and civilian
tvolunteers move across the country side. Occasionally, a Zombie
tis seen staggering through the trees or over a field. Gunfire
tcuts the creature down.

116tRoger:tJESUS. IT'S EVERYWHERE.

tSteve:tWE'RE STILL PRETTY CLOSE TO JOHNSTOWN. WE'RE
<b>tttBETTER OFF AWAY FROM THE BIG CITIES.
</b>
117tA little country airfield lies quiet in the morning sun. There
tis no sign of life. A few private planes dot the area, but the
ttower is empty. The J.A.S. chopper buzzes very low just outside
tthe tower windows.

118tAs the whirlybird slowly sets down near the fuel pumps, its
tblades create a wind blast which raises great clouds of dust
tfrom the dry earth. Sheets of old newspaper and other light
tdebris are sent flying through the air in all directions.

119tOne piece of torn newsprint blows flat against a window in one
tof the little sheds.  It sticks against the glass for a moment,
tas though glued there, then it flutters to the ground. As the
tpaper clears the glass, we see the face of a badly scarred
tZombie peering out through the window.

120tAs the group scrambles out of the helicopter, Stephen
timmediately checks the fuel pumps.

tSteve:tSHIT, MAN, DAMN NEAR EMPTY.

tRoger:tLOTTA PRIVATE PLANES IN FARM COUNTRY LIKE THIS.
<b>tttGUESS THEY ALL HIT THE PUMPS AND TOOK OFF.
</b>
tSteve:tTO WHERE? WHERE THE HELL CAN THEY GO?

tPeter:tWHERE WE GOIN?

tBy now, Steve has drained the dregs from the first pump into the
tchopper's tank, and moved to the second pump. It spurts with
tmore force.

tSteve:tTHERE'S A GOOD BIT LEFT IN THIS PUMP.

tHe stretches the hose toward the chopper but it doesn't quite
treach.

tSteve:tDAMN. I GOTTA GET IT CLOSER.

121tSteve jumps back into the cockpit and the machine lifts off the
tground.

122tFran is watching the action, walking slowly backwards to a small
trickety hangar area. She turns and looks down to the private
thangars. Most of them are open wide, the planes they housed long
tgone. One or two of the old wooden double-doors are still closed
tand locked with chains and padlocks. The wind from the chopper
tblades blows her hair and sends more debris flying.

123tPeter kicks open the door to the chart house. The room is dusty
tand dilapidated. A few small chairs surround an old wooden
ttable. Several half finished cups of coffee sit on top of
twrinkled flight charts leaving brown rings on the paper. Flies
tbuzz loudly. An old window shade clicks against its window from
tthe gusting of the wind and it makes Peter flinch.

tHe readies his weapon. When he sees the shade, he steps over to
tit easily, pulls it and lets it roll up on itself. It makes a
tloud, flapping noise.t

124tOutside, the chopper sets down. Roger is ready with the hose
tnozzle. Ducking under the blades he inserts the device into the
ttank receptacle even before Stephen has idled the engine.

tStephen hops out of the cockpit and shouts over the engine
tnoise.

tSteve:tI'M GONNA SEE WHAT'S LEFT IN THE HANGARS.

tHe trots off after Fran.

125tIn the chart house, Peter idly drops a coin into an old coffee
tmachine at one end of the room.  The machine clicks loudly and
tspits out a cup. To Peter's surprise, the cup starts to fill
twith hot brown liquid.

tWhile he waits. Peter notices a series of notes taped to the
tmachine and the surrounding walls. They are all written
thurriedly in various hands and with all sorts of inks and 
tcolours.

<b>tttLUCY - GONE TO JOHNSTOWN.
</b><b>tttCHARLES - I HAVE THE KIDS. LEFT WITH BEN.
</b><b>tttCOULDN'T WAIT. GONE TO ERIE - JACK FOSTER.
</b>
tThere are dozens of such messages. Peter takes the full coffee
tcup from the machine. As he sips it, his eyes fall on a closet
tdoor just across the room. It is moving slightly. It is locked,
tbut it bangs against the lock...once...twice...more regularly
tthan if caused by the wind drafts.

tPeter steps closer. Now the door bangs violently with a loud
tcrash, but it holds. Peter sets his coffee on the chart table
tand takes his rifle in both hands.

tAgain the door bangs hard, and a skeleton key is knocked out of
tthe keyhole. It falls to the floor with a metallic clang, and
tPeter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out
tof the closet, under the door and onto the linoleum.

tAnother bang and a gurgling moan. One of the living dead is
ttrying to break out of the closet.

tQuite calmly. Peter raises his rifle and aims it at the door
tabout head high. The rifle roars in the little room, and a
tsplintery hole appears in the old wooden door.

126tOutside, Fran and Stephen snap to attention at the sound of the
trifle. Fran stands at the entrance to one of the little wooden
thangars. Stephen is checking out the cockpit of an old Cessna
tinside. Immediately, Stephen runs out and grabs Fran's hand. As
tthey turn the corner to run up the grade to the helicopter, they
tare confronted with two Zombies, staggering slowly towards them
tthrough the dust cloud from the chopper.

tFran screams. They have no weapons with them.

tSteve:tROGER...ROGER...

127tUnder the whirling chopper blades, Roger continues to fill the
tfuel tank. In the roar of the engine, he cannot hear anything
telse.

tA third Zombie lumbers toward the helicopter. Roger's back is
tto the creature and he is unaware of the impending danger.

128tInside the chart house. Peter stares at the closet door. It is
tstill for a moment...then another moan and the door bangs again.

tPeter fires two shots, lower right and lower left of the first
tforming a triangle.

129tThe two creatures advance slowly on Fran and Steve.

tSteve:tJUST RUN.

tFran is petrified. She turns and looks behind them. They are
tboxed in by the hangars.

tSteve:tRUN RIGHT PAST 'EM...RIGHT AROUND 'EM.
<b>tttTHEY CAN'T CATCH YOU.
</b>
tShe hesitates. The Zombies draw closer.

tSteve:tRUN, FRANNIE. GODDAMMIT, I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
<b>tttWE CAN HANDLE THEM!
</b>
tFran charges up the little grade. She runs to the right of the
tcreatures and they move in her direction, arms outstretched. As
tshe draws near to the dead things, she hesitates again in
tfright. The creatures claw at the air. The one in front is
twithin a few feet of the woman.

tSteve:tRUN, FRANNIE. MOVE!

tFran stares into the dead, staring eyes of the lead Zombie. She
tis almost hypnotised. At the last instant, she runs and just
tgets past the creatures. A little up the grade, she turns and
tlooks back, stopping again.

tOne Zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after Fran. The
tother continues to advance on Stephen.

130tStephen ducks back into the open hangar. It is very dark but for
tthin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden
tboards of the structure. Stephen roots around among the greasy
ttools which clutter the area. He finds an enormous sledge
thammer. He runs out of the shed.

131tHe dodges around the lead Zombie, who staggers on with inertia.
tSteve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature. The
tman takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the
tgrade toward the Zombie's back. As he reaches the creature, he
tbrings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming
tagainst the ghoul's skull with all his might.

tThe creature staggers on for a few more steps, its head a bloody
tpulp, then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in
tthe dust.

tWithout breaking stride, Stephen grabs Fran's hand and the two
trun toward the helicopter. The other Zombie at the hangar has
tturned around and is walking up the grade.

132tRoger is pumping the last drops out of the fuel hose when he
tsees the frightened couple making for the chopper.

133tAs Steve charges up the grade he sees the Zombie approaching
tRoger from behind.  Steve shouts and Roger spins around. The
tstumbling creature is very close. It raises its arms and its
thands clutch at the air. Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the
tground. He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't
thave his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun
tholster.

tSuddenly, the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of
tits head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature
thas walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers
tforward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap.

134tStephen and Fran have reached the chopper. Steve let's go of the
twoman's hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground. He
tlunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle, ducking in
tthe propeller draft.

135tThe Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars
talmost loses its footing, but it regains its balance and
tadvances steadily toward the helicopter.

136tThe shot misses clean. He fires again. The bullet grazes the
tcreature's face. It staggers from the impact, but does not fall.

137tRoger moves quickly for his high powered weapon. Steve fires
ttwo more rounds.

138tAnother miss and another graze, this time on the arm.

139tHe is about to shoot once more when Roger stops him, stepping up
talongside.

tRoger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the
tcreatures' brain.

140tThe Zombie falls and papers blow over its body.

141tIn the chart house. Peter fires several more shots into the
tcloset door. Bullet holes appear just where the creature's head
tshould be. There seems to be no way that the volley could have
tmissed.

tSilence for a moment. Peter still holds his gun high.

tThen, with a great crash, the closet door flies open into the
troom. Two small children burst out. One has no left arm; the
tother has been bleeding from a great wound in his side. They are
tdead. They move directly toward Peter. Their heads are at least
ta foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door.

tPeter stares down at the creatures, revulsed.  He is so startled
tthat he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. The
tmoment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival
tinstincts. He cannot effectively aim his rifle. He kicks and
tthrashes around. One creature flies against a wall. The other is
tabout to bite the man's arm. The big Black grabs the small
tZombie and flings it physically back. The other creature pounces
ton his back. He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes
tagainst its brother.

tNow Peter raises his gun. As the children try to scramble to
ttheir feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession.
tFirst one creature falls; then the other.

tPeter continues to fire, his eyes wide with desperation and
tdisgust. Finally his weapon clicks. It is out of ammunition.

tPeter breathes heavily. He stares at the small corpses.
tInstinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even
tlooking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door
tof the chart house.


142tBehind him, in the brightly sunlit doorway, we see the Zombie
twho first appeared at the window. The creature staggers forward.
tPeter turns and startles. He reaches for more shells and backs
taway a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun.
tThe creature reaches out and takes another step into the room.

tPeter stares into the creatures eyes. Then suddenly, out in the
tsunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears
twith his rifle. Peter sees the man over the creature's shoulder.

143tSteve raises his gun and aims at the Zombie, but the barrel
tseems to be on a straight line with Peter.

144tPeter ducks quickly. Steve's gun fires. The bullet misses the
tcreature cleanly and crashes into the room. It ricochets off
tthe coffee machine. Another shot crashes through the glass in
tthe front room.

tPeter crouches, still stuffing shells into his weapon. A third
tof Stephen's bullets tears through the Zombie's shoulder, but
tthe creature still stands. It turns toward Peter slowly. Peter
tcrawls under the table as another shot splatters into the coffee
tcups.

145tOnce again, Roger steps up beside Stephen.  He fires one
tcarefully aimed shot, looking through his telescopic range-
tfinder.

146tJust as Peter finishes loading his weapon, the Zombie crashes
tinto the room, falling over the table and onto the floor.

147tFran is still kneeling in the dust, trying to keep herself from
tvomiting. Stephen rushes to her side. Roger, keeping his rifle
tpoised, shouts toward the chart house.

tRoger:tPETER.

148tThe big Black man appears in the doorway, snapping the safety on
this rifle.

151tFran's retching causes her to choke and cough. Steve tries to
tcomfort her, not knowing what to say and shaking himself.

152tPeter advances with long strides.

153tStephen looks up when the Black man is a dozen steps away.
tImmediately, he sees the anger in Peter's eyes. The big Trooper
tthen raises his rifle and aims it a Stephen. Steve tries to
tstand, but trips and falls on his back in the dust. In an
tinstant, Peter is looming over him with the barrel of his rifle
taimed at point blank range for the shivering man's forehead.

tFran screams through her choking...

tFran:tNO...MY GOD...DON'T... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

tPeter speaks calmly to Stephen, in low tones.

tPeter:tYOU NEVER AIM A GUN AT ANYONE, MISTER.
<b>tttIT'S SCARY.
</b><b>tttISN'T IT?
</b><b>tttISN'T IT?
</b>
tStephen looks up at the tall man, shivering. Then Peter lowers
this weapon and extends his hand, helping Stephen up onto his
tfeet.

154tRoger clears the fuel hose from around the runners of the
tchopper. Peter climbs into the cockpit and sits in the rear
twithout saying another word.

tRoger helps Fran climb aboard. Steve wanders around the front of
tthe cockpit bubble and climbs into the Pilot's seat. Roger
tclimbs in behind Fran as she squeezes into the uncomfortable
tspace beside Peter. The big black offers the woman a sip of
twater, which she accepts. Then she lets her head flop wearily
tagainst the rear bulkhead.

155tSteve is urgently surveying his flight charts, shuffling the
tpapers and trying to seem very busy after the embarrassment of
tthe incident.

tSteve:tWE GOTTA FIND FUEL. MAYBE CLOSER TO PITTSBURGH.

tRoger:tNO, WE'VE GOTTA STAY OUT OF THE BIG CITIES.
<b>tttIT IT'S ANYTHING LIKE PHILLY WE MIGHT NEVER
</b><b>tttGET OUT ALIVE.
</b>
tPeter:tWE MIGHT NOT GET OUT OF ANY PLACE ALIVE.
<b>tttWE ALMOST DIDN'T GET OUT OF HERE.
</b>
tRoger:tWE'RE GETTIN' OUTA HERE FINE.
<b>tttAS LONG AS THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE
</b><b>tttTHINGS WE CAN HANDLE 'EM EASY.
</b>
tPeter:tYEAH, WELL IT WASN'T "THOSE THINGS" THAT
<b>tttNEARLY BLEW ME AWAY!
</b>
tStephen turns around and is about to say something angrily.
tRoger stops him by speaking urgently.

tRoger:tWE GOTTA STAY IN THE STICKS. THERE'S BOUND TO
<b>tttBE MORE LITTLE PRIVATE AIRPORTS UPSTATE.
</b>
tSteve:t(reluctantly going back to his charts)
<b>tttTHERE'S THE LOCKS ALONG THE ALLGHENY.
</b><b>tttFUEL STATIONS THERE, PRIVATE AND STATE.
</b>
tRoger:tPROB'LY STILL MANNED. WE DON'T NEED THOSE
<b>tttHASSLES EITHER.
</b>
tSteve:tTHEY'RE JUST OUT AFTER SCAVENGERS...LOOTERS...

tPeter:tOH, YOU GOT THE PAPERS FOR THIS LIMOUSINE?

tSteve:t(angrily)
<b>tttI GOT J.A.S. ID. SO DOES FRAN.
</b>
tPetertRIGHT. AND WE'RE OUT HERE DOIN' TRAFFIC REPORTS?
<b>tttWAKE UP, SUCKER. WE'RE THIEVES AND BAD GUYS IS
</b><b>tttWHAT WE ARE. AND WE GOTTA FIND OUR OWN WAY!
</b>
tThere is a long silence. The engine drones, but the helicopter
tstill sits on the ground. The men look at each other. Peter
ttakes a long slug of water.

tFran:tJESUS CHRIST. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE'RE
<b>tttGOING.  WE DON'T HAVE A RADIO.  WE'RE RUNNING
</b><b>tttOUT OF WATER. WE NEED FOOD....STEPHEN,
</b><b>tttYOU NEED TO SLEEP.
</b>
156tWe see a wide shot of the little airfield. The J.A.S. chopper
tsits on the ground for a moment, it's props spinning. The, with
ta surge of power, it lifts off and flies away. The dry earth
tswirls up into clouds and blows more bits of paper over the
twide-eyed corpses which lie in the morning sunlight.

157tWe see the facade of an enormous structure. It is a huge,
tsuburban shopping mall. The outer walls are all concrete, and
ttheir clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys. The
tbuilding looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground.
tThere are only four entrances, and the shops which are housed
twithin have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot.

158tIn the immense area around the building, lanes and stalls are
tpainted for automobile parking. What few cars now dot the area
tare parked randomly, some with their doors open wide.

159tWe hear the sound of the helicopter engine fading in, then we
tsee the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the
troof of the building.

160tIn the parking lot, walking among the abandoned vehicles, we see
tseveral of the living dead.  They look almost like normal
tshoppers at the mall for morning chores, but their lumberingtwalk is unmistakably stiff.
161tAt one of the mall entrances, we see a revolving door flanked
tby several regularly hinged doors, all made of glass and
tsurrounded by large windows. A few of the Zombies manage totnegotiate the hinged doors and enter the building. Others bounce
toff windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion. One
tcreature walks around in the revolving door endlessly.

tThere are a good many of the creatures, but they are spread out
tand far between. They move with no seeming purpose.
tWe do not yet see the mall interior.  The Zombies pay notattention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead.

162tOn the roof, even as the blades of the helicopter still spin,
tthe humans are out and moving to the edge of the building. They
tlook down at the creatures which dot the parking lot.

tFran:tOH MY GOD!

tStephen:tNO CHANCE. FORGET IT, LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
tRoger:tWAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE...THEY CAN'TtttGET UP HERE.
tSteve:tYEAH, AND WE CAN'T GO DOWN THERE!

tRoger:tLET'S CHECK IT OUT.
tRoger trots away.
163tPeter has moved directly to an area where a giant grid of
ttransparent Plexiglas bubbles face down into the building. He
tstares through one of them and can see into the mall below.
tRoger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles.
tPeter:tMOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN. I DON'T THINKtttTHEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES.164tThe vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior,
ta square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent
tbubbles. The space is open all the way down to the garden, which
tis two storeys below. Around the garden on the bottom floor can
tbe seen the entrances to several shops. All but one have heavy
tmetal cage gates down and locked into position.
tOne or two Zombies are seen wandering about. They cannot enter
tthe stores, except for the one which is un-gated.

tHalfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings
tthe entire plaza, it is a second storey of shops. The same cage-
tgates seal off the visible store entrances, but none of the dead
tcreatures are evident on the balcony.

165tFran and Stephen come trotting up to the bubbles.

tRoger:tI HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM UP ON THE SECOND
<b>tttFLOOR.
</b>
tPeter:tTHE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES USUALLY USE BOTH
<b>tttFLOORS.
</b>
tRoger:tIF WE CAN GET IN UP TOP...

166tPeter is looking across the rest of the expansive rooftop. He
ttakes off toward a series of other housings which jut up out of
tthe otherwise flat surface. Roger follows.

167tFran:t(still staring down through a bubble)
<b>tttWHAT ARE THEY DOING?
</b><b>tttWHY DO THEY COME HERE?
</b>
tSteve:t(also looking down)
<b>tttSOME KIND OF INSTINCT. MEMORY...OF WHAT THEY
</b><b>tttUSED TO DO. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN
</b><b>tttTHEIR LIVES.
</b>
168tBelow, the Zombies which are in sight wander aimlessly over the
tplaza. Some try the gates but cannot budge them. One wanders out
tof the single open shop, it is a female. The shop is an
tappliance store. As the creature leaves she drags a toaster idly
tbehind her, pulling it by its power cable. It scrapes on the
tfloor loudly.

169tWe see an installation of large reflectors mounted in an
tintricate metal skeleton which stretches across a large area of
tthe roof surface.  Behind the structures can be seen a large
tpower generator.

170tPeter:tSOLAR SCREENS.

tRoger:tCAN'T BE ENOUGH TO POWER THIS PLACE.

tPeter:tEMERGENCY SYSTEM, MAYBE.

tRoger:tIT'S PRETTY LIT UP IN THERE.

tPeter:tGUESS THE POWER'S NOT OFF IN THIS AREA.
<b>tttA LOT OF PHILLY'S STILL LIT. COULD BE NUCLEAR.
</b>
171tRoger:tHEY LOOK AT THIS!

tRoger is peering down through a wire-hatched skylight. There are
tseveral laid out over this particular area of the roof. He moves
tto another while Peter looks down into the first. Fran and
tStephen jog up.

tRoger:tTHESE DON'T GO DOWN INTO THE MALL.
<b>tttWHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
</b>
tFran and Stephen peer down into the darkness. Peter pulls a
tflashlight from his utility belt.  He has stayed in full uniform
tall the while, where Roger has stripped off all but his
tammunition belt and pistol holster.

172tThe big man shines a light beam down into the space. The floor
tis only seven feet or so below the window. There is absolutely
tnothing in sight; clear floor, clear walls, all light grey.

tPeter:tDAMN.

173tRoger has moved to another window.

tRoger:tHEY, OVER HERE. THERE'S SOMETHIN' HERE.

174tPeter trots over and shines his beam down. They see a vast
tarray of cardboard cartons...hundreds of them.

tRoger:tSTORAGE?

175tPeter moves the light beam. Now it illuminates a collection of
tlarge drums, stacked floor to ceiling and running deep past the
tline of vision. On the face of each drum is the familiar symbol
tof a triangle within a circle, and the letters C.D.

176tPeter:tCIVIL DEFENCE. CIVIL DEFENCE WATER SUPPLY.

tRoger:tAND BOXES OF CANNED FOOD!

tSteve:tHOW DO WE GET DOWN THERE?

tPeter looks at Stephen as a street-wise-tough would look at a
thopeless city-slick-sissy. Then the big man brings his rifle
tbutt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to
tthe floor below.

177tInside - the vast space is impressive. It is quite dark but for
trays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights.
tWe see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums, it
tis very quiet. The space is barren except for the stacks of
tCivil Defence supplies.

178tSuddenly, a figure drops out of one of the skylights, landing on
tits feet in the sunray. It is Peter.tInstantly he readies his rifle, looking this way and that across
tthe large room. Silence.

tPeter:tOK.

tHe steps aside and Roger climbs in. He too drops cat-like to the
tfloor.179tThe two men instantly sling their rifles and move to the food
tcartons as by pre-arranged plan. They carry the big boxes
tquickly, one at a time, to the spot under the open skylight.tIn a moment, they have built a pyramid out of the cartons. It
tcreates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the window
tabove.

180tNow Fran lowers herself into the room and is able to climb down
tthe cartons holding onto Roger's hand. She is followed by an
tanxious Stephen.181tPeter has already wandered off. There are only two doors in the
tenormous room, one at either end. The big Trooper moves up to
tone of them as Roger comes up behind him, gun ready.tPeter's hand turns the doorknob. It is unlocked, and the big man
tgives Roger a familiar nod. Roger stands several feet back, his
trifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire. Then, with a
tsudden, commando-like motion. Peter throws the door open and
tducks away flat against the wall. Roger stiffens, his finger all
tbut pulling his trigger, but there is no apparent danger.

182tThe door opens onto another vast room, equivalent to the one the
tpeople are in. It also has stacks of C.D. supplies.

tThe Troopers cautiously move into the area through the door. The
troom is empty. The same sunrays pierce the darkness through
tskylights. All is dead quiet. This room has no doors at all, but
tfor the one Peter opened.
tRoger:tDOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183tIn the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the
tcartons.

tFran:tSPAM!

tRoger walks back into the room.
tRoger:tYOU BRING A CAN OPENER?

tFran:tOH.

tRoger:tTHEN DON'T KNOCK SPAM. IT'S GOT IT'S OWN KEY.

tThe woman flips over the can in her hand and finds the little
tkey.

tPeter has walked right past the group.  He is moving quickly
ttoward the still-unknown door at the other end of the room.
tAgain, Roger follows.

184tAt the door, the two Troopers go through the same S.W.A.T.
tprocedure. The door swings open, this time onto a very small
tspace. Again no immediate danger.

185tAs the men enter, they discover that they are on the top landing
tof a concrete and metal firestair. There are no windows, and the
tair is musty. There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling,
tbut down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark, and
tthere the stairs wind even further down; they recede into
tblackness.

tRoger:tWHATD'YA THINK?

tThe Black man just stares, first down into the darkness then
tback into the storage area.

tRoger:tTHIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP HERE. WHATD'YA THINK?
<b>tttCUT.
</b>
186tA great barricade of food cartons has been stacked against the
tstairway door.

187tNear the pyramid under the open skylight, the group of refugees
tsits on the floor.

tStephen is asleep. Fran sits next to his curled form, her hand
tin his hair. Roger leans against the pyramid and Peter sits in
tthe lotus position, his gun across his legs, squarely facing the
tsuspicious stairwell. He and Roger still pick at their food.
tRoger swills water from an empty Spam can which he has filled
tfrom one of the C.D. drums.

tRoger:tYOU BETTER GET SOME SLEEP, TOO, BUDDY.

tPeter:tTHERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF DOWN THERE THAT
<b>tttWE COULD USE, BROTHER.
</b>
tRoger:tI KNOW IT.

tFran stiffens at the talk.  She doesn't believe what she isthearing. She knows instantly that the men will try to raid the
tmall.tPeter:tTHEY'RE PRETTY SPREAD OUT DOWN THERE.
<b>tttIT'S A BIG PLACE. I THINK WE WOULD OUT-RUN 'EM.
</b>
tRoger:tHIT AND RUN.

tPeter:tHIT AND RUN... MAYBE GRAB US OFF A RADIO...

tFran:tYOU'RE CRAZY!tRoger:tTHIS PLACE COULD BE A GOLD MINE.
<b>tttWE GOTTA AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT.
</b>
188tRoger checks his weaponry and quickly moves toward the door
twhere he begins to remove the barricade of cartons. Peter still
tsits, checking his own guns.

189tFran:tTHIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AWAY
<b>tttFROM...LOOK WHAT HAPPENED AT THE AIRPORT...
</b>
tPeter:tTHE ONLY PROBLEM AT THE AIRPORT WAS STRAY BULLETS!
<b>tttWE COULD OUTFIGHT THOSE DUMMIES BLINDFOLDED.
</b>
tFran:tSTEPHEN...(the exhausted Pilot is sleeping through
ttttit all)

tPeter:t(standing)
<b>tttLEAVE HIM BE. WE'RE GOIN' OURSELVES.
</b>
tThe big Trooper bends over snatching up Stephen's rifle. He
tsnaps off the safety and slams a shell into the chamber. He
thands it to the woman.tPeter:tTHAT'S READY TO SHOOT. BE CAREFUL.
tFran holds the gun gingerly.tPeter:tTHE TRIGGER SQUEEZES REAL EASY, BUT THE WEAPON'LL
<b>tttKICK YOU GOOD WHEN IT FIRES. BE READY FOR THAT.
</b>
tFrant WAIT A MINUTE, I...

tPeter:tANYONE BUT US COMES UP THEM STAIRS, YOU GUYS
<b>tttTAKE OFF IN THE MACHINE. WE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT
</b><b>tttOUT TO THE PARKIN' LOT. YOU CAN PICK US UP THERE.
</b>
tFran just stares up at the big man, with desperation in her
teyes. She has stopped arguing seeing that the Troopers'
tdecision is made.

tPeter:tIF WE DON'T SHOW UP AFTER A FEW MINUTES...
tttWE'LL CATCH UP TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME.tttYOU UNDERSTAND?190tIn the dimly lit firestair, the door on the top landing pulls
topen suddenly. The stairway is still empty.tThe Troopers move slowly out onto the landing. They look down
tinto the darkness below. Then they move slowly and silently down
tthe steps. Fran appears on the upper landing. She stands in the
tdoorway clutching the rifle.tPeter stops for a moment, looking back up at the frightened
twoman.tPeter:tYOU'LL PROB'LY HEAR SOME SHOOTING.tttJUST DON'T PANIC, OK.

tFran sighs exhaustedly.

tPeter:tYOU'LL BE ALRIGHT. IT'S OUR ASSES THAT'S IN
<b>tttTHE FIRE.
</b>
191tTwo landings below, there is almost no light. Roger clicks on
this flashlight and shines the beam around. He is in a very small
tconcrete space. The stairs go down no further. There is only one
tdoor. Peter eases down the steps behind.tRoger:tTHIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP THERE.192tWe see the other side of the metal door. It stands in another
tcement walled space, which also seems small from our angle, but
tit is fully lit.tThe door opens slowly, and the Troopers cautiously step out. As
tthe camera swings around, we see that the men are at the end of
ta long narrow hallway. Directly across from them are two open
tsupply rooms, one containing a stationery sink and a toilet.
tBoth rooms are filled with cleaning supplies.193tDown along the hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways. Some
tdoors are open, some are closed. Along the opposite wall there
tis nothing.tThe far end of the hall, about a hundred yards away, opens out
tonto the second story of the mall proper.194tThe men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor.
tThey try the first two doors, which are locked. The third is
twide open.
195tRoger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised. It is
ta large administrative office, with rows of desks which are
tfully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants.196tThe next room has a closed door, but it is unlocked. Petertswings the door open and silently jumps into the room. This is
ta much more spartan area, with two metal desks and a few chairs.
tThere are several phones. It is a maintenance office. On one
twall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling
tover an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of
tthe space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and
tan entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code
tto another map of the mall showing electrical installations.tOn the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal
tcabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of tools, manual
tand electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie units and
tthere are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys,
talso colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings
tand Roger steps up behind him.tRoger:tTHE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.197tBack in the hallway, Roger's hand tries another doorknob andtthrows the door open. This opens onto beautifully plush offices,
tobviously the executive headquarters.tThe rooms interconnect, and while Peter walks from door to door
tin the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting
tPeter at each room. One office is more elegant than the next,
twith the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198tThe Troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and
tcorridor doors are closed and locked. The brass nameplate on the
tinterior door reads C.J. Porter - President.199tRoger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They move
tinto the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the
thall, and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They
tcan only see a small section.200tThe balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop
tdown to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see
tthe opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can
tbe seen. They are both gated and shut.
201tThe two realise what dangers might face them in the mall proper.
tThey look at each other and move forward, each clinging to
topposite walls in the corridor.202tAs they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer
taround their respective corners.

203tThe upper balcony totally surrounds the vast interior of the
tbuilding, and at several points bridges across from one side to
tthe other. Little shops of all types run along the entire length
tof the balcony, and at each far end, stands the entrance arches
tfor a large department store.tMost of the stores are gated, but several seem open. The big
tdepartment stores are gated and locked. Here and there tall
ttrees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of
tthe second storey. There are none of the living dead evident on
tthe balcony.204tThe two troopers move slowly and quietly to the railing. The
tcrouch and peer down through the bars of the rail. Below, the
tsight is even more spectacular.205tStores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items.tEverything from clothing to appliances. Photo equipment; audio
tand video outlets; sporting goods and weaponry; gourmet foods
tand natural organic foods. There is a Book Store, a Record
tStore, a Real Estate Agency and a Bank; A Novelty Shop, a Gift
tShop; all with the absolute latest in American consumer items.
tAnd at either end of the concourse like the main Altars at each
tend of a Cathedral, stand the mammoth two storey Department
tStores; great symbols of a consumer society.
tDown the centre of the ground floor, along with the gardens and
tpark benches, are little stalls. One is a Tobacco Specialist
tanother Jewellery; another is a small Photo Portrait stall where
tmothers had their children photographed. There are restaurants
tand Snack Bars and numerous coin operated machines selling
teverything from children's toys to Blood Pressure readings.
tThere is a large turntable, designed to spin but which is now
tstill, holding a late model car on exhibit. Another turntable
tdisplays futuristic household appliances.tThe images are all too familiar, but in their present state they
tappear as an archaeological discovery revealing the Gods and
tCustoms of a civilisation now gone.

tThe ghosts of a civilisation, however, are not figments in the
tmind. They are quite real. And they walk below in the aisles of
tthe great Cathedral. At least twenty Zombies can be seen from
tthe Troopers' perspective.

206tRoger:tIT'S CHRISTMASTIME DOWN THERE, BUDDY.
tPeter:tFAT CITY, BROTHER. HOW WE GONNA WORK IT.tRoger:tWE GET INTO THE DEPARTMENT STORES UP HERE.tttTHEY PROB'LY HAVE THEIR OWN ESCALATORS INSIDE.

tPeter:tLET'S CHECK THOSE KEYS.

207tThe Troopers stealthily pull away from the railing and back into
tthe administrative corridor. Then they move quickly down the
thall toward the Maintenance Office.

208tAs the men leave the balcony, the camera pans. Several yards
taway a Zombie staggers out of one of the open stores. It is
tfollowed by a second creature, a female without one arm. Theytare moving along the balcony toward the open corridor.

209tIn the Maintenance Office, the Troopers are checking the keys
tagainst the coded map on the wall.

tRoger:tSEVENTY TWO...U. AND D. ...HERE IT IS...

tThe men check the keys. Peter finds corresponding numbers.

tPeter:tHERE.
tRoger:tLET'S JUST HOPE IT'S RIGHT.tPeter:tLOOK HERE (on the map) THESE NUMBERS MUST ALL
tttBE LOCKS (he points) FRONT...SIDE...BACK OUTSIDE,
<b>tttMUST BE LIKE LOADING DOCKS...BUT WHAT ARE THESE?
</b>
tThe man points to several numbered spots which seem to be within
tthe big Department Store they are studying.tRoger:tWASHROOMS...EQUIPMENT...I DUNNO.tRoger moves off toward the electrical control panel. Peter still
tstares at the map.tPeter:tI GUESS THESE GOTTA BE THE GATES.
tRoger:tHOW ABOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?
tPeter:tWHAT?210tThe big Black moves up behind his partner. One of the controls
ton the panel is marked: MUSIC TAPE. It indicates a master switch
twhich is in the off position. Another is marked FLOOR EXHIBITS
tand a series of others are marked ESCALATORS. There are dozens
tof master switches which are in the off mode.
tPeter:tPOWER SWITCHES.
tRoger:tTHE MUSIC MIGHT COVER THE NOISE WE MAKE.tPeter:tHIT 'EM ALL. MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POWER INtttEVERYTHING. WE MIGHT NEED IT.

tRoger hits the switches one at a time.

211tThroughout the mall, we hear the drone of the dull, mass
tproduced music designed to lull a shopper's brain.212tUpstairs, Francine startles at the sound from below. She snaps
tthe rifle into her hands, ready to fire. She has been standing
tjust inside the storage area. She steps into the firestair and
tlooks down into the darkness. The sounds of the insipid music
tdrift up to her. She leans into the storage area again.

tFran:tSTEPHEN...
<b>tttSTEPHEN!
</b>
213tSteve, still lying on the floor against the escape pyramid,
tslowly awakens.214tDown on the first floor of the big mall, things begin to work.
tThe automobile turntable starts spinning; the great escalators
tmove up and sown. Two of the living dead, caught just starting
tup two stalled escalator, fall and roll down as the mechanical
tsteps begin moving.

tLights blink on the exhibits, and mechanical window displays
tbegin their robot-like motions. It is like a Carnival coming
talive. The Zombies which wander the floor look about in
tconfusion. Some of them swat ineffectively at the moving
texhibits.215tIn a very tall cage, which reaches from the first floor all the
tway to the ceiling, the Tropical Birds which are housed within
tbegin to flutter and squawk.216tIn a pet shop, there are puppies and kittens in a window
tdisplay. They whine and scramble over one another in fright at
tthe noise and the motion and the coloured lights.217tOn one of the floor exhibits, a rear-projection movie starts. It
tis a dryly produced film about the merits of a Real Estate
tDeveloper's new tract of suburban houses. A narrator speaks in a
tfriendly voice:
ttt... and for prices which anyone can afford,tttyou can live in these luxurious new homes
tttby Brandon. Fully electric, central air, ..etc.

218tIn the Maintenance Office, the Troopers ready themselves for
ttheir raid. Peter secures the vital key ring to his utilitytbelt and the move out.

tPeter and Roger move down the Hall and exit through door to
texterior corridor.

219tJust as Roger moves through the door into the corridor, he is
tconfronted by the Zombies from the balcony. He startles and
tducks back into the room. The closest Zombie is reaching out
twith clutching hands. Peter raises his gun and fires two shots
tcleanly through the creature's head.220tAs the shots ring through the area, Fran, standing at the top of
tthe firestair, startles. Steve grabs the rifle from the woman.

tSteve:tJESUS CHRIST...
<b>tttTHEY'RE MANIACS.
</b>
221tThe Troopers step over the corpse. The second Zombie, the
tarm less female, is walking toward them. This time Roger fires
this weapon. The creature falls in a heap.tRoger:tWHATD'YA THINK? BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT?
tPeter:tYOU GAME?tRoger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall.tTheir rifles poised, they are like commandos on an important
tmission.

tThe men at the mall mouth see the department store and start for
tit. They run from the corridor onto the balcony.222tThe battle to win the mall has begun. The creatures which wander
tthe first floor look about, attracted by the sound, but they are
tconfused. They walk this way and that, in mis-guided staggering
tstrides.223tSeveral of the Zombies try to move up the down-escalator. They
tfall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway.224tA few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall against
teach other from the movement, but one falls onto the moving
tsteps and is carried upward. Then another manages to keep its
tbalance holding on to the hand rail.
225tAt another point down the length of the mall, there is a
tstationary stairway which runs from the first to the secondtfloor. Several creatures move up the steps.

226tAt the top of the firestair, Stephen begins to move down the
tsteps cautiously. His rifle is at the ready. Fran stays on the
ttop landing.tFran:tSTEPHEN, DON'T GO DOWN THERE.ttt(he continues)
<b>tttSTEPHEN PLEASE!
</b>
tSteve:tIT'S ALRIGHT.

227tAt the huge gate which locks off the big Department Store,
tthe two Troopers come to a crashing stop.

228tThere is a side concourse which can be seen from this vantage
tpoint, and in the hall are four or five Zombies. They are about
tthree hundred feet away.

229tRoger keeps his rifle levelled off in the direction of the
tcreatures while Peter confronts the lock at the middle of the
tbig roll gate.tHe fumbles with the keys for a moment until he finally sinkstthe proper key into the receptacle which is right at the floor.tThe tumblers turn successfully.tPeter:tALRIGHT!

230tOn the escalator, the creatures which fell onto the moving steps
tare being carried up to the balcony. The one supporting himself
ton the hand rail is still standing. The head of the standing
tZombie suddenly becomes visible from Roger's perspective.

231tThe Trooper raises his gun and aims for the creature's forehead.

tPeter tries to life the roll gate. It won't move. It is still
tlocked.tPeter:tYOU BASTARD!
tRoger:tWHAT?

tPeter:tSTILL LOCKED...(he sees another assembly)
<b>tttON THE SIDE...
</b>
tThe big man moves to the far side of the gate. The same key
tfits. Roger re-focuses on the creature which is riding the
tescalator. It is quite near the top now. Roger is about to
tshoot when something catches his eye.

232tThe fallen Zombies, which up to now could not be seen behind thetescalator rail wall, suddenly come tumbling out onto the balcony
tfloor.233tRoger fires, but his aim is inaccurate.234tHe hits the standing Zombie in the neck. The creature is throwntoff balance enough to lose its footing. It falls back down the
tescalator, but before it reaches the bottom, it stops rolling.
tThe steps carry it back up toward the second floor again. It is
tstill very much alive. The two creatures on the balcony struggle
tto stand.235tRoger looks back over his shoulder.236tThe Zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and
tfifty feet away.

237tPeter turns the key in the lock, but again the gate will not
tlift. It moves slightly, as the middle mechanism and the one on
tthe far right are free, but there is a third lock on the far
tleft. Peter moves to it quickly.238tOn the first floor concourse, other creatures are beginning tottake note of the action upstairs. They start to move.239tThe Zombies on the stationary stairway are beginning to reach
tthe second floor, but they are far down the main balcony. They
twill have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach
tthe Department Store.

240tRoger fires again.

241tOne of the nearby Zombies falls in a heap.

242tAt the sound of the rifle, Fran gets desperate.

tFran:tSTEPHEN...FOR GOD'S SAKE...LET'S GET UP ON THE
tttROOF...243tSteve is at the middle landing. He stares down into the darkness
tbelow. More gunfire can be heard from the mall.

tSteve:tIT'S ALRIGHT, I'M TELLIN 'YA. THOSE THINGStttDON'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH US.tMore gunfire can be heard.244tNow the giant gate rolls up with a loud rumble. Peter ducks into
tthe store even as the gate is still rising, but the inertia of
tthe great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peter's grasp. He
tjumps to try to catch it, but he misses. It jerks up into its
tfully open position and rolls back down slightly, but still
tPeter cannot reach the lip. It slides back to rest about three
tfeet above Peter's fingertips.245tThe Zombies advance.246tRoger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he
tbacks into the archway of the Department Store entrance. Peter
tis desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach
tthe gate.247tThe Zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily.

248tPeter grabs a small counter used to display shoes, but it is too
theavy for him to move himself.

tPeter:tHERE...COME ON...

tRoger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help
tdrag the little counter. The men drag it to a point just at the
tside of the open arch, and Peter instantly jumps up on the top
tof it. At that instant, a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at
tPeter's legs. The big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes
thim to fall off the little counter. He lands on his feet, but
tout on the balcony beyond the arch. Roger brings his rifle butt
taround against the creature's head and the Zombie falls back,
tbut is not dead.

tOther creatures are only a few feet from Peter, whose gun sits
ton the little counter inside the store. Roger levels off his
trifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line. Peter makes a
tmove and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the
tright. He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into
tthe store.tNow Roger fires, dropping one, then another. Peter jumps back upton the counter.tPeter:tBEHIND YOU...BEHIND YOU...

tThe creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics
tdisplay and is regaining its footing. Roger turns and fires. Thetcreature falls. Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts
tto bring it down.

tThere are several creatures right in the archway, now they
tclutch with their hands. One blocks the downward progress of thetgate. Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back. The
tgate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other
tcreatures. Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down.
tPeter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more
tleverage.tThe bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. The two
tmen are able to move it steadily downward. The Zombies are very
tweak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. Then
tone Zombie tries to crawl under the gate. Its torso just gets
tthrough as the gate slams down against its chest. Its arms grab
tfor Peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. Its body is
tpreventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms.tRoger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the
tcreatures outside. Grabbing his rifle, Roger brings the butt
tstraight down on the clutching Zombie's skull. The Zombie goes
tlimp. Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate,
tbut the pressure is too great.
tRoger:tLET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE...

tThe gate rises a few inches. More Zombies appear outside. Their
thands clutch at the roll gate. The openings in the grid are only
tbig enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through,
tbut they are pushing the gate higher and higher...more than
tPeter intended to clear the obstructing corpse.tWith his rifle butt, Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear
texcept for one of its arms. From outside, a creature's hand
tsuddenly grabs Roger's weapon. For a moment its like a Tug-O-War.
tPeter is having a harder time holding the gate. It is inching
tupward.tPeter:tCOME ON...COME ON...tRoger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by
tthe creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate.tPeter:tTHE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY.tRoger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's armtclear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down
tmore steadily.tAt the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store,
tbut when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks
tsolidly into place.

tThe two Troopers step back from the gate. The creatures still
tmoan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers
tclutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it.
tThere are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the
tDepartment Store and several others are making their way along
tthe balcony. At least six lie dead along the floor.tRoger:tWELL...WE'RE IN...NOW, HOW THE HELL WE GONNAtttGET BACK?tPeter:tLET'S GO SHOPPIN' FIRST.

tThe two men back into the aisles of the store. The creatures
toutside still push and claw at the gate. The one with Roger's
trifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect.

249tStephen opens the door into the Administration corridor.

250tFrom his perspective, the hall is inactive. He observes the
twashrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices.

251tHe starts into the corridor, letting the firestair door close.

252tAt the top of the firestair, Fran can see the beam of light from
tthe open door below. As the door closes, the beam narrows, then
tit blinks out with a click as the door closes.tFran:tSTEPHEN...JESUS GOD...

tShe is very frightened.  She backs into the storage area.253tShe moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to thetroof. She sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers.254tIn the Department Store, Roger is riding down an escalator. He
thas found a back pack, and it is obviously already filled with
tgoods. As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor,
tthe surroundings are eerily quiet.255tHe moves through a clothing department. We see the dead looking
tfaces of store mannequins. Roger runs into one and is greatly
tstartled. He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around
this waist by its arms, then he trots off down another aisle,
twhere he finds Peter.

256tThe big Trooper has a radio under his arm and he is snatching up
ta small television.

tRoger:tHEY MAN, WE CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS SHIT...

257tPeter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something
twhich we cannot yet see. As Roger trots up, he sees that Peter
thas a big gardening cart already heaped with goods.
tRoger:tOH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT?tPeter:tWE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS
<b>tttFOR THE EXERCISE. WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO
</b><b>tttGET WHAT WE CAN.
</b>
tRoger:tTHERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN...

tEven though he doesn't understand the plan, Roger helps Peter
ttoss things into the barrow.

258tThey race down the hardware aisle tossing in tools and other
tsupplies. Electrical cables, flashlights, batteries. They scoop
tthings up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes
tin a store to grab whatever they can.259tStephen is in the Maintenance office. He examines the maps andtelectrical equipment, then rummages through a desk.260tAt the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey
tbalcony, Zombies wander past as they head for the Store entrance
twhere many creature still claw at the roll gate.261tThe Zombies move randomly. Some are leaving the gate as theirtprey is now out of sight. They begin to wander here and there.

262tThree of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and
tstart toward the offices.

263tStephen has found a large binder in the desk. It contains all
tthe plans for the mall, duplicating the charts on the walls and
tmany others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all
tthe workings and layout of the huge structure.264tElevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers
tappear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second
tstorey aisles of the big store.265tNow, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it
tineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate.
tWhen the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are
trenewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266tThey Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles.tThey run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than
tthe moving steps, then they run across the first floor until
tthey see the lower level-roll gate.267tThere are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of themtare at the gate.tPeter:tLET'S GO BROTHER...THE OLD OKEY DOKE!

tThe men move up to the roll gate. A Zombie lumbers past. Roger
tspeaks to the creature.

tRoger:tHEY, UGLY!

tThe creature turns instantly. Registers. Then dives for the
tgate with a moaning roar. Its mouth opens and its hands clutch.
tThe gate pops forward from the creature's thrust, but it holds
ttightly. The action causes Roger to jump even though there is no
timmediate danger.tPeter:tLET'S RAISE SOME HELL...HEY...HEY...
ttt(he is shouting)

tRoger:tOVER HERE...LET'S GO OVER HERE...

268tOther creatures along the concourse turn toward the Department
tStore. They lumber along attracted by the sounds.

269tAt the gate, several Zombies push at the metal grids. The
tTroopers back away, but stay in sight of the creatures.

tPeter:tJUST GIVE IT TIME ...GIVE IT TIME.

270tUpstairs, the Zombies at the upper gate are attracted by the
tcommotion below. They begin to move away from the gate and
tlumber along the balcony to the stairways and escalators.

271tIn the maintenance office, Stephen still rummages. He finds a
tloaded hand gun and stuffs it in his belt. He moves to the large
tcabinets containing the walkie talkies and the keys.272tIn the corridor, the stray Zombies move in and out of the
texecutive offices as they draw nearer to the Maintenance room.273tSeveral creatures fall over one another as they try to move down
tthe up escalator. The down escalator push others onto the first
tfloor. They scramble to their feet and move toward the
tDepartment Store.
274tIn the concourse, many creatures are moving toward the gate.
tAlready there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the
tmetal grid. Through the crowd. Peter can see several other
tcreatures lumbering down the stationary steps.

275tPeter:tOK...THEY 'RE COMIN'...

tThe big man readies his walkie talkie, pulling the antenna out.tPeter:tGO ON UP...STAY OUTTA SIGHT BUT LEMME KNOWtttWHEN ITS CLEAR ENOUGH.tRoger, clutching his walkie talkie, disappears among the aisles
tas he runs, crouching, into the store. Peter tries to hold the
tattention of the creatures at the gate.tPeter:tRIGHT HERE, BABIES...THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT...
<b>tttYOU DUMB ASS SUCKERS...YOU DUMB...YOU ARE DUMB!
</b>
276tUpstairs, the doors to the elevator glide open again and Roger
tmoves through the second floor aisles stealthily.277tStephen takes the maintenance manual and leaves the office. He
twalks down the interior corridor and opens the door to the
texterior corridor. As the door opens, the Zombies attack. The
tZombies clutch as Stephen tries to close the door on Zombie 13's
tarm. Stephen then runs back down the interior corridor.

278tStephen starts up the firestair to the door. Just then he hears
tFran call out. Realising he will lead the creatures to her, he
tcloses the door and moves toward the Maintenance office and runs
tin.

279tStephen runs into the office and slams the door.

280tA second creature is moving up behind the first, and another
tenters the corridor from the accounting office.

281tThe metal door locks only with a key. Stephen fumbles for a
tmoment with his rifle, then dives for the key cabinet. There are
thundreds of keys on rings. He looks at the wall map. He can't
tfocus in his panic.

282tIn the hall, the first creature slams against the floor. It
tdoesn't even have the intelligence to reach for the knob. It
tpounds on the door with its hands.

283tThe pounding increases Stephen's panic. He stares at the map
ttrying to focus on the maze of numbers.

284tThe second creature reaches the door and claws at it. The third
tapproaches slowly.

285tStephen rattles among the keys. His fingers shake and he cannot
tdecipher the numbers.

286tOutside, one of the creatures, in its random clutching, takes
thold of the knob and pushes in and out, not yet turning it.

287tStephen, clutching one of the rings, throws himself against the
tdoor, still trying to read the numbers. The knob finally turns.
tThe door opens against Stephen's weight. He manages to slam it
tshut despite the pushing creatures. He throws the key ring down
tand grabs his gun.

288tRoger speaks into his walkie talkie:

tRoger:tI THINK WE CAN MOVE THE WAGON.

289tPeter, downstairs, talks into his unit:

tPeter:tCLEAR?

tRoger:t(over talking unit)
<b>tttNOT ALTOGETHER, BUT THEY'RE SPREAD OUT PRETTY
</b><b>tttGOOD...ENOUGH TO MOVE THE WAGON.
</b>
tThe creatures slam against the first floor gate, but it holds
tsecurely. Peter stares at the beasts as he lowers his talk
tunit. He backs slowly away into the depths of the store.

290tUpstairs, Roger peers from behind a counter.

291tThe second floor gate is clear.

292tOn the balcony, several creatures wander aimlessly, but most of
tthem have already moved down the steps and escalators.

293tPeter is still in sight of the Zombies at the first floor
tentrance. He clips his talk unit onto his belt, then ducks and
tdisappears among the aisles.

294tHe runs, crouching out of sight, until he rounds a far wall
tand comes up into the elevator.

295tHe enters the car and pushes "2". The doors glide shut and the
tcar begins to move up.

296tAt the door of the Maintenance Office, the knob turns again. The
tdoor pushes open against Stephen weight. His feet slide on the
tlinoleum floor. He cannot get the door closed this time. Biting
this lip, he makes the sign of the cross, and backs suddenly into
tthe room holding his rifle high. The door flies open with a
tslam, and three Zombies advance into the office. Stephen tries
tto aim carefully, and he fires.

297tJust as the elevator doors open. Peter hears the gunfire. He
thesitates for a moment, then runs toward the entrance arch.

298tRoger is poised at one of the side locks on the gate. The
tgunfire stops him also as he is unlocking the mechanism.

299tAlong the balcony, some of the creatures turn around in con-
tfusion. They walk this way and that, attracted  by the sound.

300tPeter thunders up behind Roger.

tPeter:tWHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

tRoger:tFUZZ MAYBE?

tPeter:tOR MAYBE FLYBOY. WHERE'S IT COMIN' FROM?

tRoger:tCAN'T TELL.

tPeter:tCOME ON. OPEN UP.

tRoger :t MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...

tPeter:tOPEN UP. I CAN GET THE WAGON OVER. IF IT
<b>tttIS FLYBOY, LET'S GET HIM ON OUR SIDE.
</b>
tRoger moves to the second lock. More gunfire.

tPeter:t(setting his weapon on the floor)
<b>tttYOU JUST COVER ME GOOD, YOU HEAR?
</b>
tRoger moves to the third lock as Peter stands and grabs on to
tthe handles of the barrow.

301tThe body of a dead Zombie hits the floor, its head shot
tthrough. Nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break
tinto the Maintenance Office.

tThe third staggers into the room. Stephen stands fast now. He
tholds his rifle out in front of him. The creature walks toward
tthe gun. Steve holds his hands on the trigger. The Zombie lunges
tsuddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. Steve fires, but the blast
ttears through the creature's chest. Steve struggles to raise the
tbarrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim
taccurately. The gun fires again, this time grazing the Zombie's
tneck. With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the
tgun free. Steve backs against the wall. The creature tosses the
trifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. The
tZombie advances on Steve. Steve is next to the key cabinet and
tgrabs at it, trying to find some weapon. He feels the tools in
tthe cabinet and comes up with a hammer. The Zombie is about to
treach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the
tcabinet. The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but
tdoesn't fall. Steve tries to hit the creature's head with the
ttool, he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite
tit. Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor.
tThe creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like
tan animal. Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow
tsquarely in the creatures face. The Zombie comes after him again
tand from his crawling position, Steve brings the hammer as an
tuppercut to the creature's jaw. The creature falls back enough
tfor Steve to crawl across the floor. It follows, but Steve
treaches the desk and grabs his rifle. Rolling on the floor, he
tfires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it.

302tThe second floor gate rolls up with a rumble and Peter runs out
tof the Department Store with the barrow full of supplies.

303tThe action attracts the attention of several of the creatures
twhich are still wandering the balcony. They turn slowly.

304tJust as he rounds the corner. Peter almost collides with one
tcreature, and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow. He
tmanages to get past, and he runs as fast as he can toward the
topening of the Administrative corridor.

305tRoger does not let the gate roll up too high. He stabilises the
tmetal grid well within reach, then he stands his post with
tPeter's rifle. Several creatures approach from the opposite
tdirection. Roger fires at the closest one. It falls. The others
tare still too far away to waste bullets.

306tStephen steps over the corpses in the office and grabs the
tmaintenance manual. He rushes into the corridor and runs out.

307tThree more creatures move toward him up the hallway.

308tAt first Stephen freezes, then he starts backing toward the
tfirestair, his rifle poised.

309tJust as Peter is reaching the mouth of the corridor, a Zombietsteps out of the hallway into his path. Peter slams the barrow
tsquarely into the creature's legs. The Zombie falls in the
tbarrow onto the supplies. The big man slams the load against a
twall at the mouth of the corridor. Before the Zombie can get its
tbalance, the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creature's
tjacket lapels. With all his might he flings the creature out
tagainst the balcony railing. The creature flips over the rail,
tbut does not fall. Its arms and legs flailing as Peter comes up
tquickly behind and flips it over the rail. The creature makes no
tsound as it plummets to the concourse below.310tRoger fires again at a Zombie drawing dangerously near. Othertcreatures throughout the area are again converging on the
tDepartment Store entrance.311tPeter wheels the barrow into the corridor and sees Steve at thetother end, the three Zombies are still closing in.tPeter:tHOLD IT FLYBOY!312tSteve freezes. He can barely see Peter, his vision blocked by
tthe Zombies. The creatures are about thirty feet away.313tPeter:tDON'T GO INTO THE STAIRWAY!314tStephen is confused. The creatures advance.315tPeter:tDON'T OPEN THAT DOOR, BABY. YOU'LL LEAD 'EM
<b>tttRIGHT UP WITH YOU.
</b>
316tSteve is on the verge of panic.

tPeter:tRUN FOR IT.  RUN THIS WAY.
tThe Zombies are drawing closer and closer.317tPeter:tCOME ON, MAN. RUN THIS WAY. YOU CAN RUN RIGHT
<b>tttTHROUGH 'EM. WE GOTTA LEAD 'EM AWAY FROM HERE!
</b>
318tSteve sizes up the corridor. It is narrow, but there is room to
trun past the Zombies.

319tPeter:tCOME ON, FLYBOY. YOU CAN MAKE IT. COME ON!

320tWith a sudden move, Steve breaks into a run. He passes the firsttcreature easily. The second grabs him as he runs past, but the
tman keeps his footing even though he slams against the wall. He
tkeeps moving forward. The third creatures stands in his path.
tSteve lowers his head and slams into the Zombie's chest. The
tcreature flies back and falls. Steve falls and tumbles toward
tthe mouth of the passageway. He regains his footing as the
tcreatures turn to pursue him, he runs to the end of the hall
twhere Peter waits.tPeter:tNOW...HEAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT STORE...GO!321tThe two men run across the balcony. They slam into two othertZombies which clutch and grab at them without success.

322tAt the entrance arch to the store, Roger fires at another
tcreature. It falls. Other Zombies are approaching, but Steve and
tPeter dive into the arch and the three men manage to lower the
tgate without a problem.

tThe Zombies converge on the area as they did before, clutching
tand pushing at the metal cage, which holds them out securely.

tThe men breathe heavily as they back away from the gate.

tPeter:tDOWNSTAIRS AGAIN ...SAME TRICK.

323tThe men move through the aisles of the store and go crashing
tdown the escalator.

324tOn the first floor they run toward the lower gate where they
tpull up wheezing with exhaustion.

tSteve:tWHAT DO WE DO...

tRoger:tLET 'EM KNOW WE'RE HERE...
ttt(shouting)
tttWHOOOO HOOOOOO...OVER HERE...YEEE HAAAAAAAA.tSteve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation. Peter smiles
tat the young pilot.

tPeter:tYOU DID ALRIGHT THIS TIME FLYBOY.
<b>tttHOW 'BOUT IT?
</b>
tStephen laughs some more, nervously at first, then whole-
tHeartedly. Then he lets out a loud:

tSteve:tWHOOOOOOOOOOOPEEEEEEEEE...

tHe has joined the cowboys. He is like a child, almost exultant
twith the joy of their victory...
tThe three men shout through the cage at the creatures, which aretalready gathering at the gate.

325tOut on the concourse, a few Zombies wander aimlessly, but most
tare heading for the commotion on the first floor arch.

326tOn the upstairs balcony, Zombies again move toward the
tstationary steps and the escalators.

327tThe three creatures in the Administration corridor move toward
tthe open mall. Two walk out on the balcony, but the last one
tturns into an open office. Then it staggers back out and heads
tdown the hall toward the firestair.

328tFran can faintly hear the "whooping" of the men as she moves
ttoward the stairway door, which is still open.329tShe steps onto the landing and looks down into the darkness. Thetshouting stops. Desperate with fear, she moves back to the
tstorage room, then back onto the landing. Now her fear turns
tinto anger.tFran:tSHIT...tShe takes a few steps down the stairs. Stops. Goes back up.
tFran:tGOD DAMMIT!
tShe starts back down again.

330tIn the corridor below, the creature walks into another office.
tThen it moves back into the hall.

331tThe Zombies crash against the first floor gate. It holds. The
tmen crouch in the shadows of the gate.

tRoger:tWE JUST GOTTA WAIT LONGER BEFORE WE MOVE.

tPeter:tNO. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SOME OF THEM
<b>tttSTAYIN' UP ON THE BALCONY.
</b>
tRoger:tYEAH, BUT WE CAN HANDLE THAT.  WE CAN BREAK THROUGH.

tPeter:tIF ANY OF THEM SEE OR HEAR US, THEY'LL JUST
<b>tttFOLLOW US ON UP.  IT'S NO GOOD.
</b>
tRoger:tWE CAN SURE AS HELL OUT RUN 'EM...LOAD UP WHAT
<b>tttWE CAN AND GET OUTTA HERE.
</b>
tPeter:tI'M THINKIN' MAYBE WE GOT A GOOD THING GOIN' HERE.
tttMAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO LEAVE.tRoger:tOH, MAN...tPeter:tIF WE COULD GET BACK UP THERE WITHOUT THEMtttCATCHIN' ON, WE COULD HOLE UP FOR A WHILE.
<b>tttAT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH A BREATH.
</b>tttCHECK OUT THE RADIO. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...tRoger:tMAN, I DON'T KNOW...tSteve:tTHERE'S SOME KIND OF PASSAGEWAY OVER THE TOP
<b>tttOF THE STORES.
</b>
tThe Troopers look at the young pilot, almost surprised to hear
thim speak.  He has been quiet up until now.

tSteve:tI DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST HEATING DUCTS OR
<b>tttIF IT'S SOME KIND OF ACCESS. I SAW IT ON A MAP.
</b>
tPeter:tUPSTAIRS.  LET'S GO.

tThe three move off down the aisles, then duck out of sight
taround a corner. The Zombies clutch at the metal gate, moaning
tand rattling the grid loudly.332tIn the Maintenance hallway, we see the thick manual lying on thetfloor. A lumbering foot kicks it as the Zombie in the corridor
twanders into another office. The creature ignores the book, as
tit does the corpses strewn in the hall.333tIn the fire stair, Fran is on the middle landing. She is
tsuddenly overcome with a wave of nausea. She clutches at hertstomach, retching. She sits on the landing, letting her head
tflop against the wall. She is almost in tears.334tThe upstairs doors of the Department Store elevator open and thetmen trot out. As they clear a wall, they see the entrance arch.335tThere are no Zombies at the gate, but two are seen drifting
talong the balcony outside.

336tPeter:tWATCH IT...DON'T LET 'EM SEE YOU.

tThe men move stealthily along the aisles. They look up at the
tceiling and see a series of large grillwork panels. Peter shines
this flashlight beam into one.
337tThe ceiling is about twelve feet high, but the light beamtpenetrates the grille to reveal a fairly large space above.338tRoger:tLOOKS BIG ENOUGH TO CRAWL THROUGH.tPeter:tTHEY'RE LOCKED.

tRoger:tDAMN. THAT'S THOSE OTHER LOCK NUMBERS WE
<b>tttSAW ON THE CHART.
</b>
tSteve:tWHY THE HELL WOULD THEY BE LOCKED?

tPeter:tJACKPOT, FLYBOY. YOU'RE RIGHT.
tRoger:tWHAT?tPeter:tTHEY'RE LOCKED BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THROUGHttt'EM EASY FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING.tSteve:tOVER HERE.339tSteve notices that one of the ceiling grids is very close to the
televators. Peter looks at the grids, then down at the double
tdoors.tPeter:tTHE ELEVATOR SHAFT!
tHe moves over and hits the button. The doors open.
tPeter:tHOLD 'EM.tRoger stands against the rubber safety bumper, holding the car
tdoors open wide. Peter steps onto the hand railing and reaches
tup for the escape hatch, which is held in place by four knub-
theaded bolts. He removes the bolts quickly and dislodges the
thatch cover and passes it down to Stephen.tThen the big man sticks his head up through the opening.340tHe looks around the elevator shaft, shining his flash this waytand that. He sees another grid in the shaft wall.

tPeter:tIT'S HERE...AND IT AIN'T LOCKED. GET A SCREW-
<b>tttDRIVER AND SOMETHIN' TO STAND ON FOR IN HERE.
</b>
341tRoger:tI KNOW WHERE THE TOOLS ARE. GET ONE OF THOSE
<b>tttTABLES.
</b>
tRoger ducks off down an aisle and Steve moves to the nearby
tfurniture department and grabs a lightweight lamp table. The
televator doors close. When Steve returns with the table he has
tto hit the button again. The doors open. Peter is already
tclimbing out of the car into the shaft. Steve uses the table to
thold the doors open and goes to get another.
tThis time he gets a larger coffee table and sets it under the
topening in the car and puts the smaller table on top. He climbs
tup and sticks his head out into the shaft. The doors close
tagain.342tIn the greasy black shaft, amid the cables and elevatortmechanisms. Peter examines the wall grid with his flashlight.tPeter:tIT'S ALRIGHT...WE CAN GET IT OFF.
<b>tttYOU FOUND IT FLYBOY.
</b>
tEven though he speaks softly, Peter's voice has an eerie,
techoing sound in the narrow shaft.

343tThe car doors open. Steve ducks down to see Roger bearing a
tscrewdriver and pliers along with some other tools in a shopping
tbag.tRoger:tONE-STOP SHOPPING ...ANYTHING YOU NEED RIGHTtttAT YOUR FINGERTIPS.344tSteve relays the tools up to Peter, who immediately begins to
twork on the screws which mount the grid. He passes the
tflashlight to Steve who holds the beam on the work area.345tFran sits in the stairwell, her hand over her mouth. It is very
tquiet for a moment, then she hears a slight clicking. Her head
tsnaps to attention. She stares down at the bottom landing. There
tis a thump at the door.tSlowly the woman stands to her feet, her eyes transfixed on the
tdoor below.tFran:tSTEPHEN!

tThe door starts to open. Light creeps in. The slow, lumbering
tfigure of the Zombie moves into the firestair. Choking back a
tscream, Fran turns and runs up the stairs. The creature below
tfollows, unsure of itself in the dim light.

346tAt the top, Fran makes it into the storage area and slams the
tdoor. For a moment, she just backs away in terror. Then she
tgathers her wits and moves to drag the food cartons over as a
tbarricade. She struggles with one of the cartons. It is very
theavy and so large she cannot get a good grip. The smooth
tcardboard slips in her hands.347tThe Zombie has almost reached the middle landing.
348tRoger looks down through a ceiling grid. He sees the interior of
ta Sporting Goods Store. Along one wall is an arsenal of the
tlatest weaponry for the sportsman.349tRoger:tSWEET JESUS!
tPeter:tI SEEN IT. COME ON!tThe men are in a large ductwork which seems to run along the
tentire length of the mall. They move as quietly as they can.
tThere are several side tunnels branching off in both directions.

350tSteve passes another ceiling grid and looks down. He sees a
tfull equipped radio and electronics shop.

tRoger:tI HOPE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOIN', BUDDY.

tPeter:t(who is leading)
<b>tttTHIS IS IT. COME ON.
</b>
351tFran struggles with the carton. She gets it against the door
tfinally and moves to haul another.

352tThe Zombie has reached the top landing and makes for the door.

353tBefore the woman can bring another carton over, she sees the
tdoor move. She throws herself against it, but can't plant her
tfeet well because of the carton of the floor. The door moves an
tinch at a time. The creature's hand reaches into the room. It
tclutches at the edge of the door.

354tFran panics and runs back towards the escape pyramid, where she
tturns and faces the door.

355tThe creature is straining against the weight of the carton. Now,
tnow both its hands clutch the door edge. The carton moves
tanother inch...and another. Now, the creature's head can be seen
tas it strains to get through the widening space.

356tFran's eyes are wide, almost hypnotised. She looks for something
tto use as a weapon. The room is bare but for the cartons and
twater drums. She is about to opt for the skylight, when she
tglimpses Roger's knap-sack in the shadows. She runs for it as
tthe creature finally breaks into the big room.

357tThe woman's hands tremble as she rummages through the cloth
tsack. Nothing appropriate. She dumps the contents out:
tammunition, mace cans, batteries, flares...flares! She
tnervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try
tto deal with the paper wrapping.

358tThe Zombie moans as it draws closer. It is approaching the
tpyramid of cartons.

359tFran manages to free the wrapping, and snaps the cylinder in two
tat the mark.

360tNow the Zombie is between her and the pyramid, cutting off her
timmediate route. It is very near. Fran backs away a few steps as
tshe tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the
tcylinder cap. It doesn't fire...she tries again...and again.
tNow, the Zombie has reached the knap-sack. It kicks through the
titems and knocks and rolls the other flares.

tFran's flare finally catches with a great whoosh, the bright
tflame startling the woman as well as the Zombie. The creature's
teyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness.
tThe intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature
tand throws the Zombie's enormous shadow against the cartons and
twall. The creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over
tthe articles on the floor.

tFran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra
tcylinders and skirt around the Zombie in a wide arc. The
tcreature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening.

tFran considers the firestair door, but decides on the pyramid.
tShe circles around to a point where she can climb up from
tbehind the moaning Zombie. She rushes for the cartons and
tclimbs, but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares
tand crashes into the topmost carton. It starts to slide off
tthe pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the
tZombie. The creature starts to clutch at the pyramid.

tThe stack of cartons is now too short and Fran can reach the
tskylight but can't pull herself up. She accidentally drops
ttwo flares, including the lit one. It tumbles to the floor
tbehind the pyramid where it no longer offends the Zombie's
teye's. Now the creature tries to climb to the woman.

tFran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both
thands for the skylight. She lifts with all her might and her
tfeet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up. As she
ttries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes
tand wobbles from the Zombie. The creature is making progress;
tits hands can almost touch Fran's foot.

361tPeter drops out of a ceiling grid into a plush office. Roger's
tlegs appear through the grid and he too swings down, holding on
twith his hands to soften his landing.

tSuddenly, we are aware of a third person on the room in the
tlarge chair at the desk. Roger startles and grabs his gun.
tPeter just stares. They are in the President's office. Some
tdays earlier, the President, shot himself in the head.

tPeter:tCOME ON...

tSteve struggles overhead.

tPeter:tJUST DROP, I GOT YOU...tt 

tSteve:tI CAN'T...I...

tPeter:t(to Roger)
<b>tttTHE DESK...GIMME A HAND.
</b>
tThe two Troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the
tPresident's corpse. The action causes the chair to spin slightly
tand his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action.

tThe desk in place. Steve's toes can reach its surface. He loses
this balance slightly and pulls back up. He kicks a picture frame
toff the desk onto the floor, shattering the glass over photos of
tthe President's wife and children.

tPeter:tCOME ON!

tSteve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself
tdown. He stares at the corpse as Roger helps him off the desk.

362tPeter is already unlocking the door to the corridor. He opens it
ta crack and peeks out.

363tThe corridor is empty. He sees the door at the end which leads
tto the exterior corridor.

364tAs the other men come up behind, Peter opens the door quietly
tand slips into the hall. He starts to walk quickly toward the
tdoor to the exterior corridor. Roger follows as Stephen moves
tbackwards toward the fire stairs.

365tPeter's hands grab the barrow and pulls the cart down the
tcorridor backwards so as to face the mall opening.

366tIn the corridor, Steve clutches the maintenance manual. Peter
tbacks slowly up the hall. The wheels squeak and the big man
tbites his lip. Roger kicks the last corpse to the wall. Steve
tnotices that the fire stairs door is open wide.

tSteve:tJESUS CHRIST!

tHe bounds towards the door. Roger spins to see what happened.
tPeter turns and quickens his pace. Steve trots up the steps.

tRoger:t(to Peter)
<b>tttCOME ON...YOU GOT IT.
</b>
tPeter runs with the cart the last few yards. As he gets to the
tdoorway, Roger breaks up the steps.

368tSteve breaks into the storage area...he drops the manual...

tSteve:tFRANNIE!

369tThe woman turns in Steve's direction. The Zombie swats the
tflare out of Fran's hand. She startles and the cartons feel as
tthough they will topple. She steadies herself with both hands.
tThe creature is grabbing at her legs. She kicks.

370tSteve raises his rifle and moves in for a close shot.

tRoger:tDON'T SHOOT...THEY'LL HEAR YA...

tRoger arrives and the two men charge the pyramid.

371tThe creature is still clutching at Fran. She kicks violently as
tRoger pulls the back of the Zombie's clothing. The Zombie falls
tand hits the floor. As it kneels up, Steve swings the butt of
this rifle and smashes it into the thing's head. Then Roger
tdelivers a blow with his gun, straight down.

372tSteve rushes to Fran. She falls off the cartons into his arms
tsobbing and choking.

tSteve:tFRANNIE...ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
<b>tttYOU OK, FRANNIE? HEY...
</b>
tThe woman is incoherent. She is clutching at her stomach.

373tPeter appears in the doorway carrying the TV and several other
titems. He dumps them on the floor.

tPeter:tLET'S GET THIS STUFF UP, COME ON.

374tRoger is dragging the dead Zombie to the door. Peter comes to
thelp and Fran starts to wretch. Steve tries to calm her. He gets
tsome water in a can and brings it over.

tSteve:tFRANNIE...IT'S OK...COME ON, IT'S OK...ARE YOU
<b>tttHURT, HUN? DID YA HURT YOURSELF? FRANNIE...
</b>
375tDownstairs, at the exterior corridor, Peter peeks out. He can
tsee the mall at the far end. The coast is clear. He and Roger
thurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the
tfloor and retreat back into the fire stairs. Peter holds open
tthe door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment.
tConvinced they've not been seen, he closes the door.

376tPeter:tI THINK WE'RE OK, BROTHER.

tThey grab more supplies from the barrow and start upstairs.

377tSteve still tries to comfort Fran.

tSteve:tWE'RE OK...WE'RE ALL OK...WE GOT A LOT
<b>tttOF STUFF...ALL KINDS OF STUFF...
</b>
tIn the background the two Troopers bring their load of supplies
tinto the big room and deposit them near the TV. Then they go
tdownstairs for another load.

tSteve:tTHIS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE...FRANNIE. THIS PLACE
<b>tttIS PERFECT. WE GOT IT MADE IN HERE...FRANNIE.
</b>
tThe woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching.

378tNow, the enormous barricade of food cartons is stacked against
tthe door again. It is quiet except for the little noises of
teating and occasional rustle of paper. We also head a faint
telectronic whistle, but we do not recognise it.

tAs we see more of the room, we find our refugees sitting near
tthe reconstructed pyramid on the floor. Peter seems to be asleep
tup against the pyramid. Roger is nibbling at delicacies from the
tDepartment Store's Gourmet department.

tTheir "loot" is laid around them on the floor. Roger, as he
teats, is leafing through the maintenance manual. There is a
tstack of tools, some still in wrapping; electric razors, still
tboxed; some clothing articles; the radio, which also plays small
tcassettes. There are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and
tnotebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards
twith a canister of chips. The items are clearly not all
tfunctional. Some are representative of the luxuries considered
tnecessary by a consumer society.

tThey are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which
tStephen tries to tune in. Its power cable is spliced into the
tleads of a bare light fixture overhead. Fran cannot be seen at
tfirst.

tRoger:tWHAT THE HELL TIME IS IT, ANYWAY?

tSteve:tONLY ABOUT NINE.

tRoger:tAND NOTHING? (referring to the TV)

tOn the screen we see the Civil Defence logo, and realise that
tthe high pitched electronic signal is coming from the TV set.

tSteve:tAS LONG AS WE'RE GETTING THE PATTERN,
<b>tttTHAT MEANS THEY'RE SENDING.
</b>
tRoger snaps on the large, battery powered radio. He rolls the
tdial getting nothing but static. Finally, he hears a signal
tand tunes it in. A badly modulated voice is droning through
tthe interference. It sounds like a war correspondent sending
ta signal from very far away.

tRadio:t...REPORTS THAT COMMUNICATIONS WITH DETROIT
<b>tttHAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT ALONG WITH ATLANTA,
</b><b>tttBOSTON AND CERTAIN SECTIONS OF PHILADELPHIA
</b><b>tttAND NEW YORK CITY...
</b>
tRoger:tPHILLY...

tSteve:tI KNOW J.A.S IS OUT BY NOW...IT WAS A MADHOUSE
<b>tttBACK THERE...PEOPLE ARE CRAZY...IF THEY'D JUST
</b><b>tttORGANISE...IT'S TOTAL CONFUSION...I DON'T
</b><b>tttBELIEVE IT'S GOTTEN THIS BAD. I DON'T BELIEVE
</b><b>tttTHEY CAN'T HANDLE IT. LOOK AT US. LOOT AT
</b><b>tttWHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO TODAY.
</b>
379tPeter's eyes suddenly blink open. None of the rest of his body
tmoves, the others do not realise he is awake. The big man stares
tat Stephen, who is getting emotionally excited about their
texploits as a team.

tSteve:tWE KNOCKED THE SHIT OUT OF 'EM AND THEY
<b>tttNEVER TOUCHED US...NOT REALLY.
</b>
tPeter:tTHEY TOUCHED US GOOD, FLYBOY. WE'RE LUCKY
<b>tttTO GET OUT WITH OUR ASSES. YOU DON'T FORGET THAT!
</b>
380tThe other men look at Peter. The radio drones on with more
tdisaster reports.

tPeter:t YOU GET OVERCONFIDENT...UNDERESTIMATE THOSE
<b>tt    SUCKERS...AND YOU GET EATEN! HOW YOU LIKE THAT?
</b>
tPeter speaks in a low, unemotional tone. Stephen is transfixed.

tPeter:t THEY GOT A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER US BROTHER.
<b>tt    THEY DON'T THINK. THEY JUST BLIND-ASS DO WHAT
</b><b>tt    THEY GOT TO DO. NO EMOTIONS. AND THAT BUNCH
</b><b>tt    OUT THERE? THAT'S JUST A HANDFUL AND EVERY
</b><b>tt    DAY THERE'LL BE MORE.
</b><b>tt    A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE EACH DAY
</b><b>tt    FROM NATURAL CAUSES. THAT PROB'LY TRIPLES OR
</b><b>tt    BETTER WITH FOLK KNOCKIN' EACH OTHER OFF THE
</b><b>tt    WAY IT'S GOIN'.
</b><b>tt    NOW SAY EACH ONE OF THEM COMES BACK AND KILLS
</b><b>tt    TWO, AND EACH ONE OF THEM TWO MORE...
</b><b>tt    YOU KNOW ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S REWARD?t 
</b>
381tWe see Fran's face. She is listening. There is no answer
taudible. A tear rolls down the woman's cheek. The radio drones.

tAfter a time, Steve appears. He is surprised to find the woman
tawake. She sits on a new blanket from the store. Another is
trolled up as a pillow. She wipes away her tears with her
tcigarette still in her hand.

tSteve:tHEY...YOU OK?

tThe man kneels next to her, not knowing what to say. Stephen
tsits down next to her and puts his hands on her shoulders.

tFran:tSO I GUESS WE FORGET ABOUT CANADA, RIGHT?

tSteve:t(taking her in his arms)
<b>tttJESUS, FRANNIE, THIS SET UP IS SENSATIONAL.
</b><b>tttWE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED. WE SEAL OFF THAT
</b><b>tttSTAIRWAY...NOBODY'LL EVER KNOW WE'RE UP HERE.
</b><b>tttWE'D NEVER FIND ANYTHING LIKE THIS...
</b>
tFran:tI GUESS NOBODY CARES ABOUT MY VOTE, HUH?

tSteve:tCOME ON, FRANNIE, YOU WERE SLEEPING.

tFran:tWHAT HAPPENED TO GROWING VEGETABLES AND FISHING?
<b>tttWHAT HAPPENED TO THE IDEA ABOUT THE WILDERNESS...
</b><b>tttHUNDREDS OF MILES FROM ANYTHING AND ANYBODY...
</b><b>tttSTEVE, I'M AFRAID. YOU'RE HYPNOTISED BY THIS
</b><b>tttPLACE. ALL OF YOU. IT'S ALL SO BRIGHT AND NEATLY
</b><b>tttWRAPPED THAT YOU DON'T SEE...YOU DON'T SEE THAT IT
</b><b>tttCAN BE A PRISON.
</b>
tShe leans in to him, making a final plea.

tFran:tSTEPHEN, LET'S JUST TAKE WHAT WE NEED AND KEEP
<b>tttGOING.
</b>
tSteve:tWE CAN'T HARDLY CARRY ANYTHING IN THAT LITTLE BIRD.

tFran:t(angry)
<b>tttWHAY DO YOU WANT? A NEW SET OF FURNITURE? A
</b><b>tttFREEZER? A CONSOLE TV AND A STEREO? WE CAN TAKE
</b><b>tttWHAT WE NEED. WHAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE.
</b>
382tCut to a close up of Peter's face. His eyes pop open.

tPeter:tSHUT THAT THING OFF!

tRoger clicks off the radio. They listen. They hear slight sounds
tcoming from the fire stairs. The end of the room with the
tbarricade of cartons looks surreal in the blue glow of the TV
tscreen which still shines.

tRoger crawls over and clicks the TV off as well. The electronic
twhistle slowly dies. Silence.

tSteve steps out from behind the wall of cartons. Fran peers
taround the corner to look, but she still sits on the floor.
tAnother noise. The faint squeaking of the door to the bottom of
tthe steps. Then footsteps on the metal stairs. Slow...
tlumbering.

tThe faces of the humans all tighten. Peter and Roger pull their
trifles. Roger makes his ready.

tSome thumping in the hall. Steve squats down and holds Fran.
tThe sounds are closer now. The door behind the cartons clicks
tbut does not move. More pounding...then silence.

tAfter a time, the footsteps recede down the stairs.

tPeter:tSOMEBODY BETTER SIT WATCH ALL THE TIME.

tRoger:tTHEY'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THERE.

tPeter:tENOUGH OF 'EM WILL. AND IT AIN'T JUST THEM THINGS
<b>tttWE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT. THAT CHOPPER UP THERE COULD
</b><b>tttGIVE US AWAY IF SOMEBODY COMES MESS' AROUND.
</b>
tRoger:tWHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? LAND ANOTHER PILOT TO FLY
<b>tttIT OUT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA MESS WITH A LITTLE BIRD
</b><b>tttLIKE THAT. THEY GOT ENOUGH ON THEIR HANDS. YOU
</b><b>tttKNOW BACK IN PHILLY WE FOUND A BOAT IN THE MIDDLE
</b><b>tttOF INDEPENDENCE SQUARE. SOMEBODY TRYIN' TO CARRY
</b><b>tttIT TO THE RIVER, I GUESS. DIDN'T MAKE IT. DAMN
</b><b>tttTHING SAT THERE FOR EIGHT DAYS.
</b>
tPeter:tSOMEBODY FINALLY GOT IT, THOUGH. IT COMES DOWN TO
<b>tttHOW MUCH ITS WORTH.
</b>
383tFran ducks back onto her blanket. She disgustedly lights another
tcigarette. Steve sits next to her again.

tSteve:tFRANNIE...

tShe doesn't respond.

tSteve:tDAMMIT, FRAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'D
<b>tttHAVE TO LAND FOR FUEL TRYIN' TO MAKE IT UP NORTH?
</b><b>tttTHOSE THINGS ARE OUT THERE EVERYWHERE. AND THE
</b><b>tttAUTHORITIES WOULD GIVE US JUST AS HARD A TIME...
</b><b>tttMAYBE WORSE... WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE HERE, FRANNIE.
</b><b>tttWE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED RIGHT HERE!
</b>
tStephen curls up with his head on the rolled blanket.

tSteve:tCOME ON...GET SOME SLEEP.

tThe woman doesn't move.

tSteve:tFRANNIE. COME ON.

tShe grinds her cigarette out on the concrete floor and stretches
tout next to the man. He puts his arm around her. His hands rub
tup and down her body as he curls next to her. He opens her
tblouse and reaches inside. He closes his eyes and he seems
tperfectly comfortable to rest in her softness. His hand moves
tunder her clothing. She doesn't respond, at first, then her body
trelaxes somewhat and she brings one of her arms up around his
thead.

tSteve:tI'M NOT JUST BEING STUBBORN. I REALLY THINK THIS
<b>tttIS BETTER. HELL. YOU'RE THE ONE'S BEEN WANTIN' TO
</b><b>tttSET UP HOUSE.
</b>
tShe stares off across the barren room. His hands continues to
tmove under her blouse.

384tIn the Administration Corridor, a few stray Zombies wander among
tthe corpses on the floor. One large and severely wounded
tcreature pounds on the door to the interior corridor. It had
tbeen the one which was pounding at the door upstairs.

tA female Zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall. She
tlifts its arm and moves it to her mouth, but she drops it
tquickly, repelled by its coldness. She leans over and picks at
tanother corpse, then she stands and drifts towards the mall.

tSlowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the
tsecond floor balcony. We begin to hear a voice fading in over
tthe scene.

tVoice:t...NOT ACTUALLY CANNIBALISM...CANNIBALISM IN THE
<b>tttTRUE SENSE OF THE WORD, IMPLIES AN INTRASPECIE
</b><b>tttACTIVITY... THESE CREATURES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED
</b><b>tttHUMAN..THEY PREY ON HUMANS...THEY DO NOT PREY ON
</b><b>tttEACH OTHER.
</b>
385tWe see the mall balcony now. Zombies wander past the stores.
tSome move down the stationary stairs onto the main concourse.
tBelow.

tVoice:tTHEY ATTACK AND...AND FEED...ONLY ON WARM HUMAN
<b>tttFLESH...
</b>
386tAt the mall entrances, some creatures drift out into the night.
tOthers still enter the enormous building. There are not as many
tas there were in the afternoon, but there are certainly enough
tto be threatening.

tVoice:tINTELLIGENCE? SEEMINGLY LITTLE OR NO REASONING
<b>tttPOWER. WHAT BASIC SKILLS REMAIN ARE MORE
</b><b>tttREMEMBERED BEHAVIOURS FROM...FROM NORMAL LIFE.
</b>
387tSeveral creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the department
tstore. It is a strange and eerie sight. The staring, painted
teyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the
tZombies. The gate rattles but does not budge.

tVoice:tTHERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS,
<b>tttBUT EVEN THESE ACTIONS ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE...
</b><b>tttTHE USE OF EXTERNAL ARTICLES AS BLUDGEONS ETC.,
</b><b>tttEVEN ANIMALS WILL ADOPT THE BASIC USE OF TOOLS IN
</b><b>tttTHIS MANNER.
</b>
388tFran's eyes pop open the voice has awakened her. She has been
tasleep on the blanket.

tVoice:tTHESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE, MOTORISED
<b>tttINSTINCT...
</b>
tThe woman looks around. Morning sunlight is spilling in through
tthe skylights above. She sits up and peers into the next area of
tthe room. The men are gone. The television is playing. On the
ttube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room
treading the report.

389tVoice:tTHEIR ONLY DRIVE IS FOR THE FOOD WHICH SUSTAINS
<b>tttTHEM. WE MUST NOT BE LULLED BY THE CONCEPT
</b><b>tttTHAT THESE ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR FRIENDS.
</b><b>tttTHEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO SUCH EMOTIONS. THEY
</b><b>tttMUST BE DESTROYED ON SIGHT....
</b>
390tFran sees that the barricade of cartons is still in place at
tthe fire stairs door. She looks up. The skylight above the
tpyramid is open. She realises that the men are on the roof.

391tAt the edge of the roof, Peter looks through binoculars.

392tAbout a quarter of a mile away, he sees the large warehouse of
ta food processing chain. IN the yard and in the large open
tgarages of the building, he sees a fleet on enormous trailer-
ttrucks parked.

393tSteve:tYOU SURE WE CAN START 'EM.

tRoger:tYOU HAVEN'T SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THE STREET.

tPeter:tWELL LET'S GET IT UP. THERE'S NOT TOO MANY
<b>tttOF 'EM AROUND YET THIS MORNIN'.
</b>
tThe big trooper looks down to the parking lot below.

394tThere are not as many Zombies as there were the day before, and
tthey wander aimlessly, spread out rather than in clusters.

395tThe men move for the skylight.

396tIn the storage area below, Fran is examining the maps in the
tmanual. The TV still drones in a low volume. The men climb
tdown into the room.

tRoger:tHEY, FRAN...

tFran:tI WOULD HAVE MADE COFFEE AND BREAKFAST, BUT I
<b>tttDON'T HAVE MY POTS AND PANS.
</b>
tThere is a bitterness in her voice. Roger laughs. Steve senses
tthe tension. Peter just straps on his equipment.

tFran:tCAN I SAY SOMETHING?

tSteve:tSURE. WHAT DP YOU MEAN?

tFran:tI'M SORRY YOU FOUND OUT I'M PREGNANT, BECAUSE I
<b>tttDON'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY
</b><b>tttTHAN YOU'D TREAT ANOTHER GUY.
</b>
tSteve:tHEY, FRANNIE, COME ON...

tFran:tAND,...I'M NOT GONNA BE DEN MOTHER FOR YOU GUYS.

tThey all look at her, attentive now.

tFran:tAND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I
<b>tttWANT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE PLANS. THERE'S
</b><b>tttFOUR OF US, OK?
</b>
tSteve:tJESUS, FRAN...

tPeter:tFAIR ENOUGH!

tFran:tNOW. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

tPeter:tWE'RE GOIN' OUT.

tFran starts to say something, but this time Peter cuts her off.

tPeter:t...AND YOU ARE NOT COMING WITH US!

tAgain the woman starts to protest, but Peter continues.

tPeter:tAND YOU WILL NOT COME WITH US UNTIL YOU CAN
<b>tttHANDLE YOURSELF. THAT MEANS LEARN TO SHOOT AND
</b><b>tttLEARN TO FIGHT.
</b>
tThe big man starts back up the pyramid. Roger moves to
tfollow him.

tFran:tSOMETHING ELSE.

tThe men look at her. She faces Roger and Peter directly without
tlooking at Stephen.

tFran:tI DON'T KNOW ANOUT YOU TWO, BUT I WANNA LEARN
<b>tttHOW TO FLY THAT HELICOPTER.
</b>
tStephen is shocked. Fran looks at him and lowers her eyes.

tFran:tIF ANYTHING HAPPENS...WE'VE GOTTA BE ABLE TO GET
<b>tttOUT OF HERE.
</b>
tStephen doesn't know what to say. He looks at the woman,
tthen up at the other men.

tPeter:tSHE'S RIGHT, FLYBOY. COME ON, LET'S GO.

tFran:tAND YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME WITHOUT A GUN AGAIN.

tStephen thinks about protesting but he complies by slowly
tsetting his rifle down on the cartons. Then he fishes in his
tpocket for a fistful of shells and dumps them next to the gun.
tHe stares at the woman angry and hurt.

tFran picks up the weapon and shoots a glance up at Peter. 
<b>ttt
</b>tFran:tI JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE
<b>tttIT.
</b>
tPeter and Roger disappear through the skylight. Stephen stands
tstill. He looks down at the floor. Fran moves close to his side.

tFran:tI'M SORRY, STEPHEN. (it is not an apology)

tSteve:tI KNOW...I KNOW...IT'S ALRIGHT!

tHe starts up to the skylight.

tFran:tSTEPHEN

tSteve:tYEAH.

tHe stops and turns to look at her. Her eyes are pleading for
tunderstanding, but he is incapable of it at the moment. Fran
tjust shrugs off whatever she was going to say, and she sighs
twith exasperation.

tFran:tBE CAREFUL.

tSteve:tYEAH, WE'LL BE ALRIGHT.

tHe disappears through the skylight. Fran stares down at the
tweapon in her hands, then she steps over and clicks off the
ttelevision.

397tThe sudden, loud noise of the chopper engine as it hovers.
tOnly Stephen is on board at the controls.

398tIn the cab of one of the big trailer trucks Roger is crouching
tworking on the wiring beneath the dashboard.

399tPeter sits on the cab of another truck. He tries the
tcomplicated shift mechanism and fidgets with the other controls.
tThen he pulls out. He stops the big vehicle with his cab just
tabreast of the cab Roger is working in.

tPeter:tHOW ABOUT IT?

tRoger:tGETTIN' IT.

400tPeter looks around. The mall can be seen in the distance. On the
tground between, there are a few Zombies scattered about in
tlittle clusters. None of them present any immanent danger.

401tRoger sits up and is able to start his truck.

tPeter:tI'LL JUST RIDE PICK UP, I'M NOT TOO SURE OF
<b>tttTHIS THING...
</b>
tRoger:tI GREW UP ON ONE OF THESE, LET'S GO.

402tThe great trucks lumber away from the warehouse. They pull
tacross the little loading lot and out a ramp toward the
troadway. Stephen hovers overhead in the chopper, following
tthe trucks as closely as he can.

403tOn the roof of the mall, Fran clutches her rifle. She sees the
tbig trucks roar up over the hill, the helicopter just above
tthem. It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the
ttrucks as closely as it can.

404tAlong the road, several Zombies try to stagger after the trucks
tbut they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles. The
tcreatures lumber along slowly behind.

405tThe vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the
tmall's parking lot. They roar right toward the building.

406tAt one of the building entrances, a cluster of Zombies is
tmoving in and lot of the main doors. Others wander nearby in the
tparking lot. Attracted by the sounds of the engines, the
tcreatures turn and face the trucks.

tAs Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc, Roger drives his right
tup to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance
tdoors. Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb, and with
ta great, scraping crunch, the big truck pulls directly abreast
tof the building, flush with the entrance. The huge vehicle
tcrushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other
tflying back.

407tThe trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall
tentrance. Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass
tdoors open. The doors move, but cannot be opened wide enough
tfor the creatures to get out.

408tThe few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering
tat its sides. Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as
tother Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab.

409tOverhead, the whirlybird hovers very close by. Now Peter's big
ttruck pulls up alongside so that Peter's passenger door is
tdirectly abreast of the free door on Roger's cab.

tPeter's truck also crushes one or two of the creatures, but
tthere are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab.

410tAs Roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck, one
tof the Zombies grabs hold. Roger just manages to kick the
tcreature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the
tlot.

411tThe helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of
tthe big shopping centre, where Fran has been watching the
taction. She now runs to the other side of the roof, the wind
tfrom the chopper whipping her hair.

412tThe chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under
tit, then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse
tdown the road.

413tRoger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig
tpulls up beside another of the parked vans.

tPeter:tCOME ON, COME ON... THREE MORE BABY.

tRoger:tLIKE A CHARM, HUH? LIKE A FUCKING CHARM!

tRoger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he
timmediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables.

414tFrom the helicopter overhead, Stephen spots something moving
taround the warehouse. He jockeys the chopper slightly for a
tbetter look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out
tof the big garage directly toward Roger's truck.

415tIn the meantime, Peter's truck pulls away from the cab Roger is
tin. The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the
twarehouse where Peter can turn it around easily.

416tStephen swoops down with the big bird. He buzzes as close as he
tcan to Roger's truck, trying to signal the man.

417tRoger continues to work on the cables, still whooping like a
tchild. The Zombies are very close at hand. They have just
tabout reached the cab. Stephen buzzes again. Roger doesn't
tnotice.

418tPeter has now backed up into a position which enables him to
tpull out. He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight
tfor him.

419tThe big chopper buzzes right over Peter's cab then spins around
theading back for Roger.

420tPeter looks toward the other truck. He can now see the lumbering
tcreatures. He tries to slam the truck into gear, but the
tcomplicated shift mechanism fights him.

421tOne Zombie slams its hands against the driver-side window of
tRoger's truck. The man startles and tries to untangle himself
tfrom his cramped position under the big steering wheel. He is
tstuck for a moment. The other creatures appear at the passenger
tside of the cab, where the door is open. One grabs at Roger's
tlegs. Roger kicks violently, but can't get a good position. He
tfalls lower onto the floor of the cab, his body almost knotted
tamong the controls and the shift sticks.

422tPeter's truck starts to roll, but it accelerates slowly.

423tThe helicopter tries to buzz the clutching ghouls, but they do
tnot even flinch. The wind from the propeller blades whip at the
tcreatures' hair, making them look even more frightening as they
tclaw at the desperate Roger.

424tThe man kicks and kicks, but he cannot deliver a solid blow from
this pinned position. His hand gropes on the seat of the truck
tfor his rifle, which suddenly fires as the man's fingers
tinadvertently hit the trigger. A shell blasts through the chest
tof the lead creature, but the thing pays little attention.

425tPeter's truck is starting to roll faster. He heads right for
tRoger's cab.

426tThe helicopter hovers as Stephen tries to see the action.

427tNow Roger has a good grip on his gun, but he cannot clear the
tlong weapon from around the gear sticks. The lead Zombie is
tactually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the
tstruggling Trooper.

428tThe second creature is about to claw its way in when, with a
tgreat roar, Peter's truck swings up and crushes it.

429tRoger is desperately trying to keep the other Zombie's mouth
taway. They are wrestling now. The Zombie is weak, as usual, but
tRoger is still hampered by the position he is in.

430tPeter has pulled too far past the other truck. He slams his rig
tinto reverse and backs up. Now his window is in a direct line
twith the open door on Roger's cab. He raises his rifle and aims,
tbut he cannot get a clear shot. He shouts loudly trying to
tovercome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering
thelicopter.

tPeter:tGET ITS HEAD UP...GET ITS HEAD UP...

431tRoger realises that Peter is outside. He struggles with the
tcreature, dropping his gun. His hands manage to get a
tstranglehold on the creature's neck. He pushes up with all his
tmight. The Zombie's hands are clutching at the man's face. It's
tfingers push at the man's eyes.

432tPeter sees the opportunity and fires. The gun roars loudly.

433tThe Zombie's head flies apart. Remnants of blood and brain
ttissue splatter the inside of the cab and the driver's window.
tThe gummy stuff flies into Roger's face. The Zombie falls limp,
tbut Roger is still desperate. The dead weight of the creature is
tnow on top of him, and the bloody wound runs. Roger is frantic.
tHe frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the
tcreature out of the cab. The man's eyes are wide with revulsion.
tHe instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his
tface. He is quivering in extremes of emotions.

tA sudden crash. Roger spins. The Zombie at the driver door has
tsmashed through the cab window with a brick. Roger, still
tshaking, dives down to the floor for his weapon.

434tPeter tries to level off a shot but he cannot because Roger is
tin the way...

tPeter:tGET DOWN...STAY DOWN...I GOT IT!

435tRoger, in his adrenalised anger, sits up with his gun and levels
toff on the creature himself. He fires. The shell crashes through
tthe already shattered glass and squarely into the creatures
thead.

tRoger:tYOU BASTARDS...YOU BASTARDS...t

tIt seems as though his mind is snapping. His voice quivers as
tdoes his body.

tRoger:tWE GOT 'EM, BUDDY...WE GOT 'EM DIDN'T WE!

436tPeter:tCOOL IT, MAN...GET YOUR HEAD...

437tRoger:tWE GOT THIS BY THE ASS...GOT THIS BY THE ASS!

tRoger is screaming. He dives down to work on the jumping again.

438tPeter:tHEY, ROG...GET YOUR HEAD MAN...COME ON...
<b>tttWE GOT A LOT TO DO...ROGER...
</b>
439tThere is no response from the other truck. Peter is about to
topen his door and step out when suddenly Roger sits up again.
tThe engine of the truck roars. He seems to have calmed down
tsome. He looks across at Peter.

tRoger:tLET'S GO BABY...NUMBER TWO...

tPeter:tYOU ALRIGHT?

tRoger:tPERFECT, BABY...PERFECT!

tRoger guns the engine on his truck. The big vehicle lumbers out
tof the area. Peter follows suit.

440tThe two Semis rumble out of the warehouse lot and start down the
tgrade toward the road. The helicopter escorts them.

441tA few Zombies are walking up the road slowly.

442tRoger's eyes get wider with anger. He steers his big rig right
tfor the creatures.

443tThe front of the cab smashes into two of them. One is crushed
tunder the wheels, the other flies back from the impact.

444tFran watches with anxiety. She sees the two trucks pull up over
tthe rise with the helicopter following. We hear spirited music
tas the convoy approaches the mall building.

445tThe two trucks roar around the entrance ramps into the parking
tlot and again, the chopper zooms right over the roof.

446tFran trots across the roof to see the action in the lot.

447tthe trucks rumble toward the second set of doors. The music
tcontinues through the entire action.

448tRoger steers his giant vehicle directly broadside to the doors.
tThe cab knocks over several creatures and scrapes the building
tas the trailer blocks off the entrance. This time there are
tstill creatures alive in the immediate area. They clutch at the
tcab of the truck and leap at the doors.

449tFran, watching from directly above, seems inspired, caught up in
tthe bravery of the moment. As she sees the creatures converging
ton the truck, she aims her rifle at them. Before she fires,
tPeter's rig slides next to Roger's, cabs abreast.

450tPeter's truck knocks over several of the clutching creatures.
tOne Zombie, caught directly under the front wheels, is still
talive and clutching at the air. Several creatures jump at
tPeter's driver side window.

451tRoger, grabbing his gun, moves to leave his truck on Peter's
tside, but the trucks are too close. His door won't open
tenough to get out. He rolls down his window. Peter has noticed
tRoger's door won't open, and the Trooper fumbles with the gear
tshift in order to pull away, but he hears Roger shouting:

tRoger:tTHE WINDOWS...OPEN YOUR WINDOW...YOUR WINDOW...

tPeter dives across the cab and rolls down the passenger window.
tRoger leans out his open window, trying to get his weapon into
tfiring position. One or two Zombies are squeezing through the
tnarrow space between the truck. They are just about to reach
tRoger when he fires, killing the lead ghoul. More Zombies move
taround Roger's cab, moments away from him.

452tThe helicopter buzzes the area as Stephen watches the Zombies
tconverge on the cab.

453tFran, her hair blowing front he chopper, tries to aim her rifle
tinto the pack of creatures. Her hair covers her eyes and she
tbrushes it away with irritation.

tFran:tROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...

tShe shouts over the engine noises, getting very excited.

454tRoger fires again and again down the narrow space between the
trigs. Another Zombie falls.

tPeter:tFOR CHRISSAKE COME ON!

tRoger is still emotionally crazed. He leans out of his window in
ta very vulnerable position. He is whooping like a child again as
the tries to level off another shot.

tSuddenly, he's grabbed from behind by a Zombie and almost falls
tout the window. He struggles to hold himself and keep a grip on
this gun. Peter leans over, trying to get a shot at the creature,
tbut can't get a clean sight. Roger grabs the window frames on
tPeter's door and tries to pull himself up. Another creature
tgrabs him from behind.

455tFran watches with emotion in her eyes.

tFran:tMONSTERS! MONSTERS!

tShe fires her gun.

456tThe bullet slams into the pavement kicking up a cloud of smoke.
tIt narrowly misses a creature. Fran fires again. Her shot tears
tinto the shoulder of the Zombie, but it doesn't stop him.

457tThe chopper zooms very close. Peter still cannot aim his rifle,
tbut Roger, using both hands, brings his gun butt in an uppercut.
tIt slams against a creature which is grabbing him and drives the
tthing staggering back. Then with a desperate driving motion, 
tRoger climbs through the window of Peter's cab.

458tPeter pulls the big rig away even while Roger's legs still kick
tout the window. The Zombies grab at Roger's ankles, and one
tmanages to hold on as the truck starts to move.

459tFran fires again and again.

460tThis shot rips into the Zombie holding Roger's leg. It lets go
tand falls, rolling across the pavement. The woman fires again,
thitting the pavement. The creature struggles to its knees. She
tfires again and hits the creature's neck. Again.
tShoulder. Again...head. The Zombie sprawls on the pavement. Fran
tis exultant, she aims and fires at another creature.

461tThe helicopter passes overhead. The music is still stirring.

462tIn Peter's truck, just rolling out the lot, Roger realises:

tRoger:tJESUS!

tPeter:tWHAT?

tRoger:tMY GODDAM BAG...I LEFT MY GODDAM BAG IN THE
<b>tttOTHER TRUCK.
</b>
tPeter brings his vehicle to a screeching halt.

tPeter:tALRIGHT, NOW YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU
<b>tttBETTER SCREW YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD ON, BABY!
</b>
tRoger:tYEAH, YEAH...I'M O.K. LET'S GO.

tSuddenly, Peter grabs the Trooper by his lapels and slams
thim back against the door of the cab.

tPeter:tI MEAN IT! NOW YOU'RE NOT JUST PLAYIN' WITH
<b>tttYOUR LIFE, YOUR PLAYIN' WITH MINE!
</b>
tThe two men stare at each other for a moment. Roger is startled
tsomewhat out of his emotional rush.

tPeter:t(softer)
<b>tttALRIGHT, NOW ARE YOU STRAIGHT?
</b>
tRoger:tYEAH.

tPeter lets him go and returns to the wheel. He guns the engine
tand roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot.

463tWhen Fran sees the truck returning, she looks up from her gun
tsight. The helicopter has already flown over the roof, and
tStephen is confused as to why the truck hadn't appeared on the
troad. Fran turns and tries to signal to Stephen.

464tHe finally sees her and flies closer. The woman waves a signal
tand the chopper buzzes back over the lot.

465tHer hair blowing wildly, Fran takes up her post again, her rifle
tready. She thinks a moment, then begins to reload the weapon
tpulling the shells from her blouse pocket.

466tPeter's truck zooms back into position, colliding with some of
tZombies in the vicinity.

467tRoger immediately climbs through the windows into the original
tcab. He snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are
tstrewn over the seat and floor.

tAgain, creatures converge on the cab area. Two more come up
tbetween the trucks, several come around the front of the cab.

468tFran is still loading.

469tThe helicopter buzzes.

470tAs Roger climbs back through the window, his pack accidentally
tfalls to the ground. With reflex action, he drops between the
tcabs, landing on his feet. He is facing the two creatures
twhich are very close. He reaches up and with on hand on each of
tthe open window frames, he swings his legs up hard. His kick
tsends the creatures sprawling. Then, he bends to collect his
tpack and is grabbed from behind.

471tPeter tries to level off his gun but he cannot get a shot.

472tNeither can Fran who is shouting from the roof.

473tRoger keeps his head this time. His first thought is for the
tpack of tools. He tosses the sack into the cab of Peter's truck
tas though he were making a hook shot with a basketball.

474tPeter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and
tonto the floor of the cab.

475tThe creature which has a hold on Roger takes advantage of the
tman's imbalance from throwing the knapsack. It bites at the
tman's arm. Roger tears away, but blood appears at the wound.
tThen Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombie's jaw.
tThe creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies
tbehind it. Roger jumps, making a grab for the window of Peter's
tcab. The Zombies between the trucks, which Roger originally
tkicked away, have regrouped. They advance and grab at the
tstruggling trooper. Roger's feet try to get hold on the side of
tthe door, but they slip.

476tPeter moves to drop his rifle and grab Roger's hands, but Roger
tfalls from the high window back to the pavement. Peter draws his
thand gun.

477tRoger leaps again, his hands catching the window frame. The
tZombies are clutching at him. Again he swings up his legs and
tkicks the creatures off balance. This time he manages to get his
tfeet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm
twith his free hand, but another Zombie is pulling at the man's
tshirt and still another makes a grab for his legs.

tPeter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot
tat one of the clutching ghouls. It flies back and Roger is able
tto pull himself higher. His torso is just about through the
twindow when another creature grabs him.

478tPeter can no longer get a shot as Roger fills the window, so the
tbig man drops his pistol and pulls Roger's arm with all his
tmight.
<b>t
</b>479tRoger is almost all the way in but his legs still dangle,
tkicking. Peter starts the truck. As it begins to roll away, one
tof the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Roger's
tleft leg. The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf.
tBlood appears. The creature bites again and this time it comes
taway with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op
tmaterial from Roger's trousers.

480tRoger screams in pain and kicks violently. The truck
taccelerates and the Zombie finally falls clear.

481tIt rolls on the pavement for a little way before it stops.
tThen it sits on the ground, looking like a gorilla. It still
thas a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth. With its
thands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important
tmorsels.

tA bullet pings into the cement near the chewing Zombie. Another
ttears through its shoulder. It still is concerned only with its
tprize.

482tFran is firing, swearing through her teeth as the gun roars.
tShe finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head.

483tWe see it fall from her point of view on the roof. Others walk
tby the corpse without taking notice.

484tThe helicopter escorts the big truck back to the warehouse.

485tAs it rumbles along, Roger, in extreme pain, is tying his belt
ttightly around his leg as a tourniquet. He sucks air through his
tteeth in anguish.

tPeter:tTHAT'S IT.

tRoger:tBULL SHIT.

tPeter:tWE GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT LEG!

tRoger:tI'M DEALIN' WITH IT...I'M DEALIN' WITH IT FINE!
<b>tttI WON'T BE ABLE TO WALK ON THIS AT ALL IF WE WAIT.
</b>
tPeter:tCAN YOU WALK ON IT NOW?

tRoger:tYOUR DAMN RIGHT, I CAN...DAMN RIGHT, I CAN!

tThe wounded trooper struggles to wrap the bloody part of his leg
twith a torn off piece of trouser. He can hardly keep from
tscreaming, and his words come out sharply and with great breaths
tbetween them.
<b> 
</b>tRoger:tI STOP MOVIN' THIS LEG...MAY NOT EVER GET IT GOIN'
<b>tttAGAIN...THERE'S A LOT TO GET DONE BEFORE...BEFORE
</b><b>tttYOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE ME...
</b>
tThe big Black man stares at his friend for a moment. Then he
tdrives on to the warehouse escorted by the chopper.

486tThere is now a huge trailer truck at each of the four main
tentrances to the mall. They are very close to the doors, if not
tcompletely flush. Some of the glass portals can be opened not
tslightly, but not enough for the Zombies inside to pass through.

487tIn the parking lot, the creatures mob around the trucks,
tfrustrated that they cannot pass into the building. They clutch
tand claw at the enormous vehicles but to no avail. Some try to
tclimb up onto the cabs. Others try to claw at the doors on the
ttrailers.

488tSome creatures are crawling under the rigs: When they reach the
tmall doors they cannot stand, so they have no leverage. The
tcreatures inside are pushing the doors out, so the Zombies under
tthe trucks cannot push them in. The doors swing both in and out,
tso it is very clear that some access could be had by the
tcreatures if they were more organised.

tOne creature, having crawled under a trailer, does manage to
tpush open a mall door. The thing crawls into the building
tthrough the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit. They
tbehave as a swarm of insects.

tThe revolving door offers the best access for the creatures,
talthough its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty
tbrains. Two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which
tblocks the revolving door, and one of them negotiates the
trotating action and enters the concourse.

489tPeter and Stephen are huddled over the maps of the building.
tThey are back in the crawl space. The cartons are still piled
tagainst the firestair entrance.

tPeter:tIT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MANY OF THEM ARE STILL
<b>tttINSIDE. THAT'S A LONG HAUL BETWEEN THOSE ENTRANCES.
</b>
tSteve:tWELL IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE FLARES...OR MAYBE
<b>tttSOME OF THOSE PROPANE JOBS.
</b>
tPeter:tTHE GUNS ARE FIRST. GUNS AND AMMUNITION.

490tRoger moans with pain. Nearby, Fran is applying a dressing to
this leg. The wound is wrapped with several layers of cloth. The
tfirst aid kit is open on the floor. Peter crouches near his
tfriend. He takes over from Fran. He ties more strips tightly
taround the wound and around the upper thigh.

tPeter:tYOU SURE YOU GONNA MAKE IT, BUDDY?

tRoger:tJUST HURRY UP WITH THAT!

491tAgain, the military music. A tall figure drops out of a ceiling
tgrid and lands on the floor of the Sporting Goods Store. It is
tPeter. His rifle is slung and there is an empty pack on his
tback. Several of the Maintenance Room key rings are strapped
tinto his belt.

492tSuddenly a Zombie charges across the room. The gate to the mall
tbalcony is open on this store. Another creature, attracted by
tthe commotion, starts through the open entrance arch.

493tStephen is starting down through the ceiling grid. He also has
tequipment strapped onto his body. He sees the charging creature.
tPeter is trying to unsling his rifle. Stephen conquers his fear
tof the height, and lets himself fall to the floor. He crumples
tup when he hits, and rolls into a store exhibit, knocking things
tflying.

tPeter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing
tcreature. Stephen regains his footing. The second creature is
tmoving up the aisle. Stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a
tnearby exhibit. It is loaded. It fires with a strumming sound
tand the small shaft rips cleanly through the creature's skull
tand imbeds itself in a wall beyond. The Zombie walks forward a
tfew steps before it falls.
<b> 
</b>494tThe men run toward the entrance arch. Leaping up on an adjacent
tcounter top, Peter manages to reach the lip of the roll gate and
the swings it down fast. Stephen catches the cage below and slams
tit into place just as another ghoul falls against it moaning and
tclawing.

tStephen unslings his gun and is about to level it off on the
tcreature outside. Peter jumps down from the counter.

tPeter:tDON'T TRY TO SHOOT THROUGH THOSE GATES.
<b>tttOPENINGS ARE TOO SMALL. BULLET'LL WIND UP
</b><b>tttCHASIN' US AROUND IN HERE.
</b>
tThe Zombie crashes all its might against the metal cage.
tStephen startles.

tPeter:tHE CAN'T GET THROUGH...COME ON...

495tThe men crash back through the store and Peter moves right to
tthe racks of weapons. He pulls down a gorgeous high powered
trifle which is equipped with a sophisticated scope for sighting.

tPeter:tAIN'T IT A CRIME!

tSteve:tWHAT?

tPeter:t(looking through the telescope)
<b>tttTHE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD EVER MISS WITH THIS
</b><b>tttGUN...IS THE SUCKER WITH THE BREAD TO BUY IT.
</b>
496tThe cross hairs of the telescope zero in on the enlarged
tforehead of the Zombie, which is thrashing against the roll
tgates. The sight gives up a sense of the super-weapon's lethal
taccuracy.

497tStephen dives into the ammunition and moves behind the counter
twhere he pulls out boxes of shiny new hand guns.

tPeter finds elaborate holsters and ammunition belts. He pulls
tseveral other rifles from the rack. We recognise the firepower
tin the arsenal that the two men accumulate.

498tOther Zombies appear at the gate, but they cannot break in.

499tPeter:t(at the creatures)
<b>tttYOU JUST WAIT OUT THERE, SISSIES...
</b><b>tttWE COMIN'...AND WE READY!
</b>
500tWith a swell in the music, the band of all four humans charges
tout of the Maintenance corridor and makes a break for the
tDepartment Store. They all wear new double holsters containing
thand guns. Each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and
tanother in hand. They wear ammo belts and carry packs with
tother supplies. The wounded Roger is sitting in the big
tgardening cart which Peter earlier used to carry the first
tsupply load out of the store. Peter runs, pushing the cart
tbefore him.

tThere are only a few creatures on the balcony. The dead things
tturn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos.
tRoger, his hands free to shoot, fires his weapon several times
tat some of the creatures who are closest.

501tThe creatures from the main concourse below begin to move up
tthe stationary staircase and struggle with the escalators.
tThe corpses of creatures slain in the earlier battles still
tclutters in the area.

502tFran and Steve are the first to reach the entrance to the 
tDepartment Store. Steve falls immediately on the gate locks.
tPeter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate. He turns the
tcart in a full 180 so that Roger is facing out toward the mall.

tSteve fumbles with the second lock. Peter faces the few Zombies
twhich are converging along the balcony. He lift his new
tSuper-gun and stares through the scope. The gun roars
teloquently. Even its sound pronounces its power. The single
tshot rips cleanly through the centre-forehead of one of the
tcreatures.

tThe man aims at another head. Blam. Another perfect kill. Then a
tthird. Roger fires several times.

tFran stands ready at the roll gate. As Stephen finishes with the
tfinal lock, the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up.
tSteve stands, and the two roll the cage into the ceiling, but
tStephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp.

tFran moves into the store and Peter pulls the cart behind him.
tThen Steve, Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any of
tthe advancing creatures reach the area.

503tAgain, the Zombies smash into the cage, but the humans are
talready running through the aisles of the big store.

504tPeter wheels Roger into the elevator and hits the button for the
tfirst floor. The doors shut and the car starts down.

tPeter:tHOW'S THE RIDE?

tRoger:tKIND BUMPY. WATCH IT.

tThe stern Black face stares down at the back of the wounded
tman's head. Despite his attempt at humour, the stiffness in
tRoger's body evidences his pain. Peter puts his hand squarely
ton the Trooper's shoulder.

tPeter:tLOOK HERE...I...

tRoger:tI KNOW, I KNOW...SHUT UP.

tSomething very serious is shared between the two men, some
tknowledge which we do not fully understand. We do see the
tkind of bond shared by soldiers in a battle.

505tThe elevator doors glide open and Peter pushes the cart out
tinto the first floor on the big store.

506tFran and Stephen charge down the store escalator moving faster
tthan the steps themselves.

507tThey run through the hardware department where Stephen snatches
tup several propane torches. Fran stuffs extra bottles of gas
tinto her back pack.

508tWith a great hiss one of the propane nozzles spits a white-hot
tflame as it is lit with a new disposable lighter. Fran holds
ttwo torches as Stephen lights them.

509tPeter steps up to the first floor entrance gate with Roger in
tfront of him. Several creatures outside of the cage fly into
tsudden frenzy at seeing the humans. They slam against the grid
tbut it holds as usual.

tPeter:tUNLOCK THE MIDDLE ONE LAST.

510tSteve falls on the right hand lock with his keys. The Zombies
tall converge near the crouching man's side of the gate. They
tpush and shove. Fran holds one of the lit torches very close and
tthe creatures back away cringing. The lock opens and Steve moves
tto the extreme left.

tAgain the Zombies follow and again Fran is ready with the torch.

tPeter:tALRIGHT...THE TOUGHEST PART'LL BE GETTIN'
<b>tttBY THESE RIGHT HERE...
</b>
tSteve:tIT'S A LONG HAUL DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE.

511tPeter cranes his neck to see past the Zombies and down the
tconcourse. Several other creatures are starting toward the
tDepartment Store. Behind them, about three hundred feet away, is
tone of the main entrances which is blocked off outside by a
ttruck trailer.

512tPeter:tWE'LL BE ALRIGHT!

tFran:tIT'S TOO FAR!

tPeter:tTHERE'S NO BACKIN' OUT NOW. WE GOTTA LOCK
<b>tttTHOSE DOORS!
</b>
tFran:tWE'LL NEVER MAKE ALL FOUR. IT'S TOO RISKY.

tSteve:tYOU JUST STAY HERE AND BE READY TO UPEN UP FOR US.

tFran:tTHE CAR!

tPeter:tWHAT?

tFran:tTHE CAR!

513tOutside, we see the slowly spinning exhibit which displays the
tnew automobile. It is a sleek, sporty model, which looks fast
tand manoeuvrable.

514tPeter looks down at Roger.

tPeter:tYOU OK TO START IT?

tRoger nods and reaches for his supply pack. He is cringing
twith pain, but he moves efficiently.

515tThe Zombies clutch at the gate with new vigour. At the unlocked
tends the grid gives a little, but still holds the creature out.
tFran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away.
tSteve un-locks the middle lock.

tSteve:tIT'S GOIN' UP!

516tThe gate swings up with a thunderous roar. The Zombies attack
tbut Fran's torches make them hold back slightly. Steve grabs
tone of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol
twith the other. Fran draws a hand gun also. The two fire into
tthe pack of Zombies. One or two fall. The others try to move
tin but are afraid of the bright flames. One gets close to Steve
tbut the man blasts his torch directly into its face. Its hair
tcatches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about,
tknocking other Zombies back.

517tNow Peter sees an opening and he makes a break with the cart.
tRoger holds on to the sides. They crash through the scattered
tpack of ghouls successfully and Peter makes for the car exhibit.
tThere are a few creatures on the concourse on the cart's path.

tPeter:t(shouting)
<b>tttCLOSE THE GATE...CLOSE THE GATE...
</b>
518tSteve grabs the lip of the roll cage and it starts down. Fran is
tstill inside the store with one of the torches.

tFran:tTHE KEYS, STEPHEN...THE KEYS!

tSteve tries to stop the downward progress of the gate but it
tslams shut with a metallic crash.

tFran:tJESUS CHRIST!

519tPeter stops in his tracks when he hears the woman's shouts. He
tlooks back. Several of the creatures have followed the cart.
tThey advance slowly.

520tSeveral have stayed with Stephen, however, and they approach
tStephen as he tries to pass the keys back through the gate.
tThe big ring doesn't fit through the small openings.

tSteve:t YOU MOTHER!

tFran:tKEEP 'EM...JUST KEEP 'EM...LOOK OUT!

tThe Zombies at Stephen's back are very close. Steve lunges at
tthem with his torch. They back off slightly.

521tPeter:tCOME ON, MAN! GET OUTA THERE!

tThe creatures on the concourse are approaching the cart. A
tpained Roger levels off several shots, but he is very shaky from
this extreme pain. He manages to down one of the Zombies.

522tFran:tSTEPHEN...FOR GOD SAKE...

tThe woman holds up her torch so that the bright flame faces the
tghouls. Stephen crouches and puts a key in the right hand lock.
tThe Zombies converge on him.

523tPeter, seeing other creatures drawing near, starts to push the
tcart again. he manages to dodges two little clusters of the
twalking dead.

524tThe lock clicks just as one bold creature grabs Stephen from
tbehind, Fran tries to aim her torch closer. It disarms the
tZombie for a moment, Stephen thrashes his body back knocking
tthe think off balance. Then he quickly slides the keys under
tthe gate which he can lift just high enough with the single
tlock undone.

tAnother ghoul grabs Steve from behind. This time Steve's torch
tis knocked flying and rolls away. Fran is desperate. She tries
tto aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill. She holds
ther torch high.

tSteve kicks and scrambles, rolling on the floor. The Zombies
tare on him. He manages to knock one or two of them to the
tfloor. Then he fires with his pistol, killing another, He
tcrawls to the torch and grabs it, the creatures clutching and
ttugging at his pants and shirt.

tHe brings the flame up and flashes it at the Zombies. They back
taway enough for him to crawl to an open space. Then he scrambles
tto his feet and charges down the concourse toward the car.

525tAt the exhibit, Peter stops the cart. There are two of the
tlumbering creatures close at hand. The big trooper raises his
trifle. Roger, using all his strength, manages to pull himself up
tout of the cart. He lips to the exhibit as Peter fires at the
toncoming ghouls. The super-gun scores two perfect hits.

526tAs Roger tries to step onto the spinning platform, he falls and
trolls against the car. The turntable carries him around toward
tanother creature. He is struggling in pain toward the driver's
tdoor of the vehicle.

527tSteve, who is approaching at a run, sees the action.

tSteve:tWATCH IS ROGER...ROGER!

528tRoger turns his head and sees the ghoul just before the creature
tgrabs him. The things hands clutch at the wrapped wound, which
tis already leaking blood through its dressing. Roger screams
tloudly.

529tPeter jumps up onto the spinning turntable, leans across the
thood of the car. His super-gun drills a hole through the
tcreature's skull. It falls off the exhibit.

530tPeter hurriedly comes around to Roger's side. In extreme pain,
tthe Trooper is desperately trying to open the driver door. Peter
thelps him. The door opens and Peter eases his friend into the
tseat. Roger immediately goes to work under the dash.

531tZombies are advancing now from all over the concourse.

532tPeter:tGET IN!

tHe is shouting at Stephen who is just rushing up to the
tplatform. He and the Trooper scramble into opposite sides of the
tback seat. They slam the doors and make sure that all buttons
tare locked. Roger works as quickly as he can.

533tSeveral of the lead creatures reach the turntable. Some fall
ttrying to step onto the moving disc, but others manage to
tstruggle over to the car. They smash the windows with their
thands. It is a nightmarish scene as the men huddle in the
tshiny, new car which spins very slowly in circles.

534tFran has relocked the one open gate mechanism, and she stands
tnow trying to see the action, but it is out of her line of
tvision. She can only hear the moaning of the creatures, and
tpounding on the car. She turns the valve on her propane nozzle
textinguishing the flame.

535tThe car's engine roars as Roger is able to jump the wires.

tSteve:tI'LL DRIVE IT...

tRoger:tI GOT IT.

tThe Trooper's face contorts in agony as he moves himself into
tposition behind the wheel. He is shaking, but he bites his lip
tand slams the car into gear. There are at least eight creatures
tcrawling over the car, more approach. The platform spins. Roger
twaits until the car is aimed directly down the concourse. The
tmen in the back seats are alert to the Zombies which pound at
tthe windows. The ugly and distorted faces press close against
tthe safety glass.

536tNow the car pulls out quickly. It rolls of the edge of the
tspinning display, knocking several of the creatures aside. The
tfront wheels move off the platform and bounce onto the floor,
tbut the frame of the car scrapes the top of the disc and is
tstuck for a moment. The disc spins on carrying the rear of the
tcar with it. Then Roger gives it more gas. The rear wheels spin
tand finally catch.

537tThe car shoots out onto the mall floor. Some of the Zombies
tcling for a moment, but they fall away quickly, scrambling to
tregain their footing and follow.

538tThe car swerves and for an instant seems as though it will
tcrash against the columns on the concourse. Roger manages to
tcontrol it, and the shiny vehicle zooms ahead with tremendous
tenergy.

539tOne of the stray creatures in the concourse tries to intercept
tthe speeding auto, but the car knocks him mercilessly aside as
tthough he were a bowling pin.

540tFran sees the car as it rounds the corner, heads directly for
tthe main entrance which she can see from her position.

541tThe Zombies at the entrance already started back into the mall
tattracted by the commotion. The car zooms down the concourse
teasily breaking their ranks.

542tRoger throws the manoeuvrable vehicle into a screeching
ttailspin, stopping just at the doors.

543tThe big trailer blocks the entrance effectively. There are some
tcreatures inside the doors. Under the van, several Zombies are
tstruggling with the doors. one is just pushing in and seems as
tthough it will be able to enter.

544tPeter and Stephen slam against the door. Stephen aims his torch
tdirectly at the crawling creatures. The one in front withdraws
tits arm. The grotesque things writhe, kick under the truck. The
tdoor slams and Peter produces another set of master keys. They
tare all coded. he falls on the lock mechanism.

tPeter:tTHAT'S NOT 100%, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'LL GET
<b>tttTHROUGH.
</b>
tSteve:tCAN'T THEY SMASH THE GLASS?

tPeter:tSAFETY STUFF...PRETTY INDESTRUCTIBLE...THEY GOT
<b>tttNO LEVERAGE UNDER THE TRUCK.. GIMME THE ALARMS...
</b>
545tSteve rummages in his back pack. Produces two portable battery
toperated burglar alarms. Peter activates the units, stands them
tagainst the base of the now locked doors. As he crouches near
tthe glass, creatures outside go into a frenzy clawing at the
tglass doors. They cannot get in.

tPeter:tI'M HOPIN' THEY'LL JUST GO AWAY AFTER THEY FIND
<b>tttTHEY CAN'T GET IN...
</b>
546tThe creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting
tclose to the action.

547tThe men hop back into the car, it roars off with Roger still at
tthe wheel.

548tAgain the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing
tZombies. They fall and scatter.

549tThe car speeds down the concourse, turns the corner near where
tFran watches at the Department Store game. We hear Steve's voice
ton the woman's walkie talkie.

tSteve:tWE'RE OK...WE GOT IT MADE...IT'GONNA WORK.

tFran stares out through the roll cage. The Zombies are
tstaggering weakly after the car.

550tWith another tailspin, the auto pulls up at the second set of
tdoors. The men scramble out of the back seat, the Zombies
toutside try to crawl under the second trailer. The men shut them
tout easily, locking the door and planting alarms. They stand to
tlook down the concourse.

551tThe creatures seem even more spread out now.

tSteve:tHOW MANY YOU FIGURE ARE ALREADY IN...

tPeter:tDUNNO. NOT TOO MANY. WE'LL GET 'EM EASY. WE
<b>tttGET IT ALL LOCKED OFF AND WE'RE GOIN' ON A HUNT!
</b><b>  
</b>tThe big Trooper raises his super-gun and sights through the
ttelescope.

552tAs we see through the scope, cross hairs settle on the forehead
tof one of the creatures which is lumbering down the hall. The
tface is magnified, distorted by the telescope. The gun roars and
tthe head in the scope explodes with red.

553tThe creature falls against a column, hit squarely through the
tbrain. We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon.

554tIt is night. The Zombies in the parking lot still group around
tthe semis. They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight. A slow
tpiece of music starts to build.

555tThe creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall.
tThey pound and scratch at the doors, to no avail.

556tFrom inside the concourse, the mob is muffled. Even the
trevolving door is locked now. It seems the most vulnerable, but
tthe crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the
tglass panels and they have no tools to pound with.

tThe auto is flush against the revolving doors inside, offering
tadded protection. Several alarm units sit atop the car. They
tare the early warning devices against penetration.

557tThey camera starts to dolly back, the music builds. We see slain
tcorpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the
tbuilding. It is like a battlefield after a war.

558tThe humans appear on the second storey balcony. Moving to the
trailing, looking down to the expanse of the building. They are
tguerrilla fighters, with their weapons strapped on. They have
ttaken the Temple. The music hits a crescendo as the people look
tover their spoils. Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as he
tlimps to the rails, supporting himself on his arms.

559tWe see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building.
tZombies lie dead everywhere. The humans have captures the gold of
tthe Gods...In this case the Gods of Consumer Heaven.

560tPeter's hand is on the maps of the Maintenance Corridor. He is
tdrawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near
tthe firestair.

tPeter:tWE PUT UP THE WALL HERE. THERE'S NO DOOR FROM
<b>tttTHE LAST OFFICE INTO THE WASHROOMS, SO NOBODY'LL
</b><b>tttGET NOSEY...AND THIS WAY WE CAN STILL GET TO THE
</b><b>tttPLUMBING...
</b>
tSteve:tWHY CAN'T WE JUST BOARD UP THE STAIRWAY. HELL,
<b>tttTHEY CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH A STACK OF CARTONS.
</b>
tPeter:tI'M NOT JUST WORRYIN' ABOUT THEM. SOONER OR
<b>tttLATER MIGHT BE A PATROL THROUGH HERE...LOOTERS
</b><b>tttMAYBE...I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO EVEN KNOW THAT
</b><b>tttSTAIRWAY EXISTS.
</b>
tThey look back at the map.

tPeter:tTHE DUCTWORK RUNS ALL THE WAY INTO THE WASHROOMS.
<b>tttWE'LL HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT THAT WAY. WE'LL
</b><b>tttBRING UP ANY BUG STUFF WE WANT BEFORE WE PUT UP
</b><b>tttTHE WALL.
</b>
561tThe men sit huddled. The large storage area is filled with
tmounds of supplies brought up from the mall stores, but the
tstuff all sits around in disarray.

562tBehind the wall of cartons, Roger seems to be sleeping, but he
tis sweating feverishly, and his face twitches. Fran has been
ttrying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead. Now she
tstops, leaving the cloth on the shivering head. She moves out
tto Stephen and Peter.

563tFran:tHE SEEMS TO BE SLEEPING.

tPeter:tGOOD.

564tThe woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the
tcartons. There are bottles, vials and diabetic hypo syringes as
twell as bandages and dressings from the Pharmacy in the mall.

tFran:tI DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO...

tSteve:tYOU'RE DOIN' FINE.

tFran:tHIS LEG IS AWFUL...THE INFECTION IS SPREADING FAST.
<b>tttCAN'T WE FLY HIM OUT OF HERE...TRY TO FIND A MED.
</b><b>tttUNIT...
</b>
565tSteve looks at Peter. The big trooper speaks softly.

tPeter:tI'VE SEEN HALF A DOZEN GUYS GET BITTEN BY THOSE
<b>tttTHINGS...NONE OF 'EM LASTED MORE THAN THIRTY SIX
</b><b>tttHOURS.
</b>
566tFran is stunned. Suddenly, Roger screams from behind the cartons.

tRoger:tPETER...PETER...WHERE ARE YOU?

567tPeter:tRIGHT HERE, BUDDY.

568tRoger is sitting up. His eyes look very dark and sunken. He is
tsweating even more profusely than before.

tRoger:tYEAH...YEAH...

tHe licks his lips. He looks around the vast, barren room, trying
tto clear his eyesight.

569tOutside, Fran sits on a carton. The men are still huddled
taround the spoils. Roger occasional shouts from the other
troom.

tRoger:tWE DID IT, HUH, BUDDY? WE WHIPPED 'EM.

tPeter:tTHAT'S RIGHT ROG.

tRoger:tDIDN'T WE? PETER? DIDN'T WE WHIP 'EM?

tPeter:tWE SURE DID, BUDDY.

tRoger:tWE WHIPPED 'EM AND GOT IT ALL! WE GOT IT ALL!

tThe man's voice sounds pathetic as it echoes through the big
tstorage area bouncing off barren walls.

570tA hammer slams into nails behind the fake wall which the people
tare working on. A great network of two-by-fours are braced at
tthe rear of the corridor, more lumber is wedged against walls
tmaking a frame. Stephen is slamming large nails into the
tframework for reinforcement. On the frame's face a masonite
tpanel is nailed into place on one side. Peter works in the
tcorridor. He is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the
tnew partition look like a finished wall.

tIn the corridor, there are power tools lying about and a vast
tarray of other hardware in the gardening cart. Fran appears from
tout of the washrooms. She is carrying an old can of paint which
thas obviously been used.

tFran:tTHIS MUST HAVE BEEN FOR TOUCH UP...IT LOOKS
<b>tttPERFECT.
</b>
tPeter grabs the can and pries it open quickly with a screw
tdriver. He dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto
tthe new wall where it butts against the corridor. It is a
tperfect match.

tSteve:t(to Fran) ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT BEFORE WE CLOSE
<b>tttIT OFF?
</b>
tFran:tNO...

tThe woman is staring down the corridor toward the mall proper.

571tThe corpses from the hall have been carried out of the way.
tThey are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony.
tIt is a grisly sight. Fran turns away.

572tFran:tNO.

tShe steps back through the unfinished partition, leans against
tthe framework. Her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke
tback a gag. Steve moves up behind her, but she feels another
twave of nausea and she darts for the washroom. Steve sets down
this hammer and follows.

573tThe woman is kneeling on the floor, propped up by her hands on
tthe toilet seat. She is vomiting. Steve approaches quietly. His
thand falls on her back.

tFran:tLEAVE ME ALONE...IT'S ALRIGHT...IT'S MY PROBLEM.

tSteve:tFRANNIE...

tFran:tJUST GET OUTA HERE, STEPHEN...I DON'T WANT YOU
<b>tttHERE.
</b>
tThe man doesn't move. Fran reaches up, taking his hand. She
tclutches it tightly, indicating that she is not angry.

tFran:tI DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME THIS WAY...

tAnother wave hits her and she wretches again. She pulls her
thand back leaning over the toilet bowl.

tFran:tPLEASE GO...I'M ALRIGHT...PLEASE...

tStephen stands up reluctantly and drift out of the room. The
twoman wretches but she is dry. She tries to swallow. Then sits
ton the floor next to the toilet holding her stomach. She
tfumbles with the flush handle, depressing it. The rushing water
tmakes an ugly sound. Fran looks down at her stomach thinking of
ther pregnancy.

574tStephen steps out of the unfinished framework. Peter is gazing
tdown the corridor at the pile of corpses.

tPeter:tTHIS PLACE IS GONNA BE ROTTEN...WE GOTTA
<b>tttCLEAN UP, BROTHER.
</b>
tFlies buzz about the staring faces of the dead things on the
tbalcony.

575tPeter's hands are on the round hatch wheel of an enormous safe.

tPeter:tTHEY'RE USUALLY ON A TIMER...OPEN AT
<b>tttNINE...LOCKED AT FOUR...KEEPS THE BANKERS HONEST.
</b>
tThe wheel spins and Peter swings the giant door open.

576tInside is a huge safety deposit vault of a bank. The men stand
tfor a moment in awe. The clean walls are lined with drawers and
tdoors where depositors have stored their valuables. At one end
tof the room there are stacks and stacks of paper bills. The men
tapproach the piles of money, stooping down.

tThey each pick up packets of bills and flip through the edges...

tPeter stuffs several packets into his knapsack. Steve looks at
thim quizzically.

tPeter:tYOU NEVER KNOW, BROTHER.

tSteve takes several stacks and stuffs them into his kit. He
tlooks about the enormous vault.

tSteve:tDON'T YA WONDER WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ARE GONNA
<b>tttTHINK...GUYS IN THE FUTURE...DIGGIN' THE PLACE
</b><b>tttUP. IMAGINE ALL THE STUFF IN THESE BOXES...
</b><b>tttJEWELLERY...MAYBE THEY'LL FIGURE IT'S ALL SOME
</b><b>tttKIND OF OFFERING TO THE GODS...LIKE IN THE
</b><b>tttPYRAMIDS...A BURIAL CHAMBER.
</b>
tPeter:tTHAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, NOW.....

577tWe see the men wheeling gardening carts piled with corpses. The
tsombre image is shocking as the figures move in silhouette
tagainst the bright store fronts with their displays of goods
tdesigned to attract shoppers to the sweet life the items
tpretend to represent.

578tAt the bank, Peter wheels a cart with several dead Zombies
tthrough the lobby.

579tIn the vault, the big Trooper dumps bodies out on top of
tseveral others, already deposited. The corpses lie askew, their
tarms and legs protruding. The stacks of money are upset by the
tlimp action of the bodies as they roll around.

580tA finger flips a switch and we hear the mall music start up
tslowly.

581tWe see a montage: Fran, Stephen and Peter walk slowly through
tthe conquered building. They drift in and out of stores picking
tup various items. They use shopping carts.

582tFran rummages idly through the cosmetic department.

583tPeter looks through a book store.

584tStephen plays the pinball machines in a huge game room.

585tPeter tries on big colourful hats in front if a mirror.

586tFran trims Stephen's hair as he sits in the mechanical chair of
tthe mall Barber Shop.

587tFran feeds the animals in the Pet Store, then with a bag of seed,
tshe feeds the Tropical Birds in the tall cage out on the
tconcourse. The birds flutter, flap about, screeching loudly.

588tNow the group walk along the upper balcony. They look down.
tThey still have their weapons and kits, Peter is wearing a wide
tbrimmed hat and Fran sports a new mink coat.

589tThe concourse is empty now of corpses, but the group can hear
tthe moaning and thumping at the main entrances. It is dark
toutside, the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in
tthe shadows under the big trailer trucks. The sound evidences
ttheir presence, however.

590tThe people stand at the balcony railing overlooking their realm.

tFran:tTHEY'RE STILL HERE.

tSteve:tTHEY'RE AFTER US...THEY KNOW WE'RE IN HERE.

tPeter:tTHEY'RE AFTER THE PLACE...THEY DON'T KNOW
<b>tttWHY...THEY JUST REMEMBER...REMEMBER THAT
</b><b>tttTHEY WANNA BE IN HERE!
</b>
tThe noise at the entrance continues eerily. Fran starts to be
tafraid.

tFran:tWHAT THE HELL ARE THEY?

tPeter:tTHEY'RE US, THAT'S ALL. THERE'S NO MORE
<b>tttROOM IN HELL.
</b>
tSteve:tWHAT?

tPeter:tSOMETHIN' MY GRANDADDY USED TO TELL US...YOU
<b>tttKNOW MACUMBA? VOODOO... GRANDADDY WAS A PRIEST
</b><b>tttIN TRINIDAD. USED TO TELL US...WHEN THERE'S NO
</b><b>tttMORE ROOM IN HELL...THE DEAD WILL WALK THE EARTH.
</b>
591tRoger is screaming wildly. He is sweating and his face looks
tsunken with an ashen colour. He thrashes about as Steve tries to
thold him. His leg is swollen, almost all black. His arm, which
twas also bitten, is wrapped but oozing.

tSteve:tGET MORE VALIUM IN HIM...

tFran fumbles with one of the hypodermics, but she drops the vial
tof serum and it shatters on the floor.

tSteve:tGET ANOTHER ONE...COME ON...

tRoger is throwing himself about wildly. Steve barely manages to
thold on. Fran rushes into the other room.

592tThe space is starting to look like living quarters. There is
tfurniture. There are sectioned off areas with things still
tpacked in cartons, but it is beginning to look like home.

593tThe woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more
torganised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator. She
ttakes a new vial of serum from the freezer.

594tDownstairs, Peter is checking the covering at the floor base of
tthe fake wall. He hears the violent screaming from above.

595tHe climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling, scrambles through the
tgrill in the ceiling, enters the duct. Then he pulls up the
tladder and closes the grill.

596tHe crawls through the tight space for a few feet, and drops out
tof another grill into the washroom.

597tHe moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair. 

598tAll the while, Roger's screaming can be heard. Peter tramps up
tthe stairs several at a time.

599tHe rushes through the living space in the direction of the
tscreams.

600tFran is withdrawing a hypodermic from Roger's good arm. The man
tstill thrashes wildly. Steve is struggling to hold him. Peter
trushes in and helps. Fran drifts out of the room.

tAfter a short time Roger relaxes somewhat.

tPeter:t(to Steve) GO ON...I'LL STAY WITH HIM.

tSteve leaves the area.

601tIn the living spaces, Fran is sitting in a chair. It is the
tinflatable kind, which can be collapsed like a balloon. Steve
tcomes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind.
tShe cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly. She stares
toff across the room.

602tRoger catches his breath and looks up at Peter. He licks his
tlips and tries to speak coherently.

tRoger:tYOU...YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME, RIGHT, PETER?
<b>tttYOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...WHEN I GO...
</b>
tPeter:tI WILL.

tRoger:tI DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND LIKE THAT PETER...
<b>tttNOT AFTER I GO...I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND
</b><b>tttLIKE THAT...
</b>
tThe man's eyes are terrified. He looks this way and that at the
twalls, the ceiling, at Peter...He can't focus...

tRoger:tPETER? PETER?

tPeter:tI'M HERE, TROOPER.

tRoger:tYOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...I KNOW YOU WILL...

tPeter:tI WILL.

tRoger:tPETER?

tPeter:tYEAH, BROTHER.

tRoger:tPETER, DON'T DO IT...TIL YOUR SURE...SURE I'M COMIN'
<b>tttBACK...DON'T DO IT TIL YOU'RE SURE...I MIGHT NOT
</b><b>tttCOME BACK, PETER...I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO...I'M
</b><b>tttGONNA TRY...NOT TO COME BACK...
</b>
603tLater, the moon shines down through the skylight in the living
tarea. A sturdy ladder has now replaced the pyramid of cartons
tup to the open hatch.

604tStephen fiddles with the television. There is a faint signal
tcoming in. He has the set wired to a makeshift antenna which
tstretches through the skylight. A table lamp sits on a small
tend table and is lit. Its cable is patched into a network of
twiring which stretches about the room.

605tFran is unpacking things. She is stacking dishes and silverware.
tIt is a very orderly scene. The couple looks like a pair of
tnewlyweds who have just moved into a new house.

606tOn the television, two men are talking, a commentator and an
tofficial of the Government. The Scientist is in a suit, but his
ttie is rumpled and his collar open. He has not shaved and he
tseems very tired and nervously upset.

tScientist:   I'VE GOT TO...BE CAREFUL WITH WORDS HERE...WE
<b>tttHAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STUDY THEIR HABITS...WE'VE
</b><b>tttREPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A LIVE CAPTURE SO WE CAN HAVE
</b><b>tttCONTROLLED STUDY...WE NEED SUPPLY AND DEMAND
</b><b>tttRATIOS.
</b>
tComm.:tYOU MEAN...THEIR NEED VERSUS...

tScientist:   VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF FOOD AVAILABLE. LETS BE BLUNT.

tThere is a commotion in the TV studio. We hear noises and
tshouting, as we did J.A.S. earlier.

607tSteve:tJESUS CHRIST.

tHe squats near the set, staring. Fran comes up behind him.

608tScientist:   PROJECT OUT THEIR RATE OF GROWTH...THERE'S A
<b>tttCRITICAL BALANCE...AND IT'S THE WASTE THAT KILLS
</b><b>tttUS. LITERALLY...THEY USE...THEY USE MAYBE FIVE
</b><b>tttPERCENT OF THE FOOD AVAILABLE ON THE HUMAN
</b><b>tttBODY...AND THEN THE BODY IS USUALLY INTACT ENOUGH
</b><b>tttTO BE MOBILE WHEN IT REVIVES. THERE'S AN ECOLOGICAL
</b><b>tttIMBALANCE AND THEY'RE INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING...
</b>
tComm.:tWHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?

tScientist:   WE HAVE TO BE UNEMOTIONAL...WE HAVE TO PROVIDE
<b>tttCOUNTER MEASURES OR WE'RE ALL...
</b>
tComm.:tCOUNTER MEASURES?

tScientist:   THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE RATE OF GROWTH AND CON-
<b>tttSUMPTION...WE HAVE TO CONTROL IT FOR THEM!
</b>
tComm.:tYOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT WE HELP THEM?

tScientist:   BY HELPING THEM IN THIS CASE WE SAVE OURSELVES...

tA great outcry is heard in the studio. The camera bobbles
taround. The scientist is fumbling for words.

609tStephen:tGOOD GOD.

610tIn the other room, Peter sits against a wall. He can hear the
ttelevision. His eyes stare straight ahead at something.

tScientist:   I'M PROPOSING THAT CERTAIN...NECESSARY MEASURES
<b>tttBE PUT INTO EFFECT AT ONCE...MEASURES APPLYING TO
</b><b>tttALL OFFICIAL SEARCH AND DESTROY UNITS, WHILE
</b><b>tttTHEY'RE STILL OPERATIVE...HOSPITALS...RESCUE
</b><b>tttSTATIONS...AND ANY...PRIVATE CITIZENS...
</b>
tThe camera pulls off Peter's face. We see that his rifle is
tstretched across his lap. The TV drones on from the other room.

tScientist:   IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE MOBILE UNITS OF THE O.B.P.
<b>tttTHE CORPSES OF THE RECENTLY DEAD SHOULD BE
</b><b>tttDELIVERED OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES FOR COLLECTION
</b><b>tttIN REFRIGERATED VANS...THEY SHOULD BE DECAPITATED
</b><b>tttTO PREVENT REVIVAL...
</b>
tWe see now what Peter is staring at. On the floor, twenty feet
taway lies the corpse of Roger. It's face is covered with a
tblanket. It lies very still.

tScientist:   THIS COLLECTION...THIS COLLECTION...

tThe man's voice is heard almost shouting over the voices from
tthe studio. The angry staff protests vigorously, with
temotional language...

tScientist:   THIS COLLECTION COULD BE...STORED...RATIONED...
<b>tttFOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE INFECTED SOCIETY...
</b>
tThe shouts of anger continue.

<b>tttIN AN ATTEMPT...IN AN ATTEMPT TO CURB THE SENSELESS
</b><b>tttSLAUGHTER...THE SENSELESS SLAUGHTER OF OUR OWN
</b><b>tttSOCIETY...
</b>
tSuddenly the dead Roger's foot seems to move under the blanket.
tPeter's eyes pick up the movement immediately. His hands
ttighten on his weapon.

tScientist:   THE DISSECTION...THE DISSECTION OF THE CORPSES CAN
<b>tttBE CARRIED OUT...CARRIED OUT WITH RESPECT FOR THE
</b><b>tttDIGNITY OF THE HUMAN BODY...
</b>
tRoger's arms seem to move, in slight twitching motions...

<b>tttTHE HEADS...THE HEADS AND THE ...SKELETONS...
</b><b>tttWHENEVER POSSIBLE...COULD BE IDENTIFIED AND...
</b><b>tttAND BURIED IN CONSECRATED GROUNDS...
</b>
tThe commotion in the studio reaches a fever pitch.

tFrom the movement beneath, the blanket starts to creep down off
tRoger's face. Peter stares with fascination and disbelief.
tThe blanket clears the blankly staring eyes...the drooling
tmouth...Roger tries to sit up/ Peter's hands click a shell into
this super-gun.

tSuddenly, the corpse sits up. It stares at Peter, blankly at
tfirst, then with purpose...it starts to move towards the Trooper
twho calmly raises his weapon...

611tOn the TV, the commotion still rages. Stephen and Fran stare at
tthe tube, hardly believing what they see. The scientist is
tshouting above the din. He is nervous. He wipes his brow with
this sleeve...

tScientist:   WE'VE GOT TO REMAIN UNEMOTIONAL...UNEMOTIONAL...
<b>tttRATIONAL...LOGICAL...TACTICAL! TACTICAL!
</b>
612tSteve:tTHEY'RE CRAZY...THEY'RE CRAZY...

tFran:tIT'S REALLY...ALL OVER, ISN'T IT...

tBLAM! The loud roar of Peter's gun from the next room. Fran
tstartles and falls into Stephen's arms.

613tRoger's corpse is dumped on top of the stack of bodies in the
tBank vault. His eyes stare with a puzzled expression. The arms
tand legs of the other bodies make the room look like a
tRenaissance Painting of hell itself. There is the familiar
tgunshot wound in Roger's forehead.

tThe heavy door of the vault closes with a metallic slam which
techoes through out the mall.

614tA small puppy lifts its leg and urinates on a table.

tFran:tADAM! NO NO!

tThe woman's hands reach into frame and grab the little animal.
tShe carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid
tout in an unused part of the storage area.

tFran's stomach is big now, her pregnancy evident. She wipes her
tbrow like an exhausted housewife, and shuffles back into the
tliving area. She fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress
twhich she and Steve obviously share. There is an end table near
tthe bed, with a reading light. Books lie strewn around, along
twith magazines and half drunk cups of coffee.

615tIn the sitting room, we see a scene which could be comfortable
tsuburban. The furniture is neatly arranged. There is a small
tportable stove which operates on bottled gas, a refrigerator,
tand cabinets with dishes and silverware.

616tThere is a modern calendar on the wall, which has three months
tcrossed off. There are a variety of radio and TV units and a
tstereo record player. There are even decorations: paintings
thung, knick knacks on the tables. The room almost looks like a
twealthy man's den, with all the gadget-oriented affluence.

617tIn the Department Store, Stephen wanders about. He fiddles with
ta new supersonic calculator and he looks at adult games.

618tOn the roof, in the bright sun of early morning, Peter plays
ttennis against one of the shed walls. He's dressed in a new
tsweat suit with brightly coloured Addidas sneakers. He has a
tsleek new racquet, slamming phosphorescent balls with all his
tmight. His face is set in what is almost anger. He attacks each
tshot with determination and emotion.

619tOne of his shots misses the shed. The ball bounces and banks off
tthe lip of the roof, then it tumbles over the edge.

620tIn the parking lot below, the ball hits the pavement. It bounces
tseveral times, rolling off among the feet of the army of Zombies
twandering this way and that through the area.

621tThe creatures mob around the trucks at the main entrances. They
tmoan and gurgle, clawing at the building. There seem to be
thundreds of them, all different ages, sexes, shapes. Some
tclothed, some naked, some wounded, some almost untouched.

622tNow Fran, the pregnant housewife, is cooking supper.

623tThe men play cards with hundred dollar bills in the living space.

624tThe three sit around the dinner table, just finishing their
tsupper. The TV set is on, but only grey snow fills the screen
tand the speaker hisses as it receives no signal.

tFran:tTHERE HASN'T BEEN A BROADCAST FOR THREE DAYS.
<b>tttWHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP?
</b>
tSteve:tTHEY MIGHT COME BACK ON.

tFran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the
tTV. She clicks it off. The woman returns to the table.

tSteve stands up and moves to the set. He clicks it back on.
tPeter watches the two sheepishly. It is a domestic scene. The
tgroup has become a family, with all the disadvantages of
tcomfortable living, including the inability to communicate.  

tFran:tWHAT HAVE WE DONE TO OURSELVES?

625tThe thunderous roar of the helicopter engine. The machine is
thovering over the roof of the mall.

626tFran is at the controls. Steve sits in the passenger seat.

tSteve:tOK, NOW EASY...EASY...BRING 'ER DOWN...

627tThe whirlybird starts down for the roof. It is somewhat
tunstable, but it eases down regularly.

628tIn the cockpit, a flustered Fran manages to handle the controls.

tSteve:tEASY...STABILISE IT...THAT'S IT...

tThe woman reacts efficiently. She handles the controls better as
tThe chopper's runners are just about on the roofs surface.

tSteve:tTHAT'S IT...THAT'S IT...YOU GOT IT!

629tThe runners hit the roof surface and the chopper settles.

630tFran throws her arms impulsively around Stephen's neck.

tSteve:tYOU DID IT...YOU DID IT, HON...YOU DID IT...

tThe woman excitedly hugs and kisses Stephen with childish joy.
tShe is bubbling.

631tSeen from a great distance, the helicopter atop the mall looks
tvery small. Its engine dies and begins to whine.

632tA pair of binoculars is watching the action. The lenses pull
taway from a pair of beady eyes.

tVoice:tTHEY MUST GET IN THROUGH THE ROOF.

tVoice:tSON OF A BITCH!

tVoice:tTHERE'S TRUCKS BLOCKIN' ALL THE ENTRANCES.

tVoice:tNO SWEAT!

tVoice:tWHAT DO YA THINK? HIT 'EM NOW OR WAIT
<b>tttFOR TONIGHT?
</b>
tVoice:tTONIGHT.

633tWe see the short wave radio speaker installed in the living
tspace near the TV. A voice rattles over the unit:

tVoice:tWE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE...SEEN THE WHIRLYBIRD
<b>tttON THE ROOF.
</b>
634tFran steps to the doorway attracted by the signal. Peter sits at
tthe radio, not knowing whether to send. Steve listens.

tVoice:tHEY, ER...COULD YA USE SOME COMPANY IN THERE?

tSteve is about to say something. Peter stops him.

tVoice:tWE'RE JUST RIDIN' BY...WE COULD SURE USE
<b>tttSOME SUPPLIES...WHAT'S THE CHANCE US
</b><b>tttGETTIN' IN THERE TO STOCK UP?
</b>
tPeter listens intently, trying to read the voice's inflections.

tVoice:tHOW MANY OF YOU IN THERE, ANYWAY...THERE'S
<b>tttTHREE OF US. COULDN'T YA USE THREE MORE GUNS?
</b>
tPeter:tRAIDERS.

tFran:tWELL, THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE, MAYBE WE SHOULD...

tPeter:t(cutting her off)
<b>tttNO CHANCE.
</b>
tThe little puppy scrambles up to Fran's feet, seeking attention.
tShe picks the little dog up in her arms.

tFran:tWELL, IF THERE'S ONLY THREE OF THEM...

tPeter:tWHO SAYS?

tThere's a long silence. The radio sputters static. Voices are
theard, but they aren't speaking into the microphone. They are
tobviously conferring among themselves. Steve starts to speak,
tPeter cuts him off.

tPeter:tSHHHH! QUIET!

tHe is trying to hear the muffled conversation.

tFran:tI THINK WE SHOULD...

tPeter:tJESUS CHRIST, SHUT UP AND LISTEN!

tMore static. Slight laughter is heard. Steve looks into Peter's
tface. The bug trooper just stares at the speaker without moving.
tFinally, the voice again.

tVoice:tHEY...YOU IN THE MALL...YOU JUST FUCKED UP
<b>tttREAL BAD! WE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO DON'T SHARE.
</b>
tInstantly Peter grabs his weapon and straps on his holster.

tPeter:tCOME ON, MAN...GET IT UP.

635tUnder the cover of darkness, a pair of hands stores a microphone
ton a portable radio unit. The radio is in a small van which is
tcluttered with junk. An arsenal of weapons is strewn about.

636tWe see several men, and a few women, huddling inside the van.
tThey look like banditos. One even wears a Mexican sombrero. The
tmen are armed to the teeth, wearing ammunition belts criss-
tcrossed on their chests. They are dirty and sloppily dressed in
tall sorts of surplus clothing.

637tOutside, in close-up shots, hands turn controls on big motor-
tcycles and feet stomp accelerators. The bikes roar, creating a
tthunderous sound. Clouds of dust and fumes rise into the air.

638tPeter and Stephen are running across the mall roof. The roar of
tthe cycles can be heard in the distance.

639tReaching the roof's edge, Peter stares off at the horizon, but
tsees nothing. The thunder draws nearer. Peter tries binoculars.

640tThrough the lenses are vague shapes in the darkness. As the
tsound swells, we see the riders. Their powerful bikes come
tcharging over a rise...two...then three more...three more...
tmore...

tThey are accompanied by two small vans. There are at least
tfifteen bikes. The sound is deafening.

641tPeter:tJUST THREE, HUH?

tSteve:tHOLY SHIT!

tPeter:tTHEY'LL GET IN. THEY'LL MOVE THE TRUCKS.

tSteve:tTHERE'S HUNDREDS OF THOSE CREATURES DOWN THERE.

tPeter:tCOME ON, MAN. THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL ARMY.
<b>tttLOOKS LIKE THEY BEEN SURVIVIN' ON THE ROAD ALL
</b><b>tttTHROUGH THIS THING...DAMN! HOW MANY OF THE
</b><b>tttSTORES ARE OPEN?
</b>
tSteve:tI DUNNO...SEVERAL OF 'EM...

tPeter:tWELL LET'S NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR 'EM...COME ON!

642tThe men charge down through the skylight. The roar of the
tconvoy can now be heard in the living space.

tFran is desperate. Steve rushes by her with Peter, who crashes
ton ahead through the door onto the firestairs.

tFran:tWHAT'S HAPPENING?

tSteve:tTHERE'S FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF 'EM...
<b>tttWE'RE GONNA SHUT OFF THE GATES.
</b>
tFran:tSTEPHEN!

tSteve:tWE'RE JUST GONNA SHUT THE GATES.
<b>tttTHEY'LL NEVER FIND US UP HERE.
</b>
tThe man disappears through the stairway door. Fran drops the
tpuppy which goes running after the men floppily.

tFran thinks to chase the dog, but instead moves to the storage
tarea and snatches her weapons. She starts to load her rifle.

643tOutside, the convoy makes a pass at one of the trucks. In the
tdarkness the Zombies clutch at the fast bikes. The raiders
tfire their guns, dropping several of the creatures.

tThe mob of creatures is impenetrable at first. The raiders
tleader signals the convoy to drop back across the parking lot.
tSome raiders have trouble keeping balance as Zombies claw them.

644tThe lead bikes pull up on the other side of the lot.

tRaider:t THEY'LL SPREAD OUT COMIN' AFTER US...
<b>tttTHEN WE GO IN WITH THE VAN...
</b>
645tThe other bikes ride to the leaders. A van pulls in and two
tbikers scramble aboard through the side doors. One of the women
tjumps into the driver's seat and revs the engine.

646tThe Zombies are starting to move out after the convoy. The mob
tat the mall entrance is thinning somewhat.

647tIn the mall, Peter drops from the grill in the exterior corridor.
tHe charges out and into the Maintenance corridor, where he
tbreaks for the mall proper. He is followed by Stephen.

tPeter:t(shouting)
<b>tttDOWNSTAIRS FIRST...
</b>
tSteve:tOK...

tPeter:tGOT YOUR TALK BOX?

tSteve:tYEAH.

tPeter:tKEEP IS HANDY.

648tOutside, the Raiders' van revs and roars towards the mall. The
tbikers stay at the other side of the lot, engines idling. Some
tof them whoop and holler like American Indians.

649tThe van crashes through the advancing Zombies. Several of them
tare knocked flying. The vehicle pulls up to the truck cab. Three
tmen pile out and scramble into the truck. The Zombies in the
tarea clutch at the raiders, but they fight their way clear. The
twoman in the van revs the engine again. Zombies claw at her
twindow. She squeals back to the main biker group.

650tThe Zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of
tmotorcycles from a good distance. The raiders open fire. They,
ttoo, possess sophisticated weapons, the barrage sets up a great
tnoise. Several creatures fall. The little van pulls up behind
tthe bikes. The men still whoop and shout.

651tOn the floor on the mall, Peter and Steve dash about slamming
troll gates down on the open stores. They run desperately through
tthe empty concourses. They hear the din from outside.

652tAt the trailer cab, a raider fires point blank at the Zombies
tthat claw at the passenger window. Another man checks cables.

tRaider:t SHIT...IT'S STILL TAPED UP...IT'S ALL READY
<b>tttFOR US...
</b>
tThe man sits at the wheel, revving the engine. Ghouls at
twindows.

653tInside, the men hear the truck starting. Steve slams down the
tPharmacy gate. Peter is already running to the Department
tStore. The big Trooper crashes up the escalator to the second
tfloor aisles. Steve breaks for the open Hardware Store.

654tThe huge trailer rolls away from the mall entrance. A shout of
tvictory goes up from the raiders. The Zombies at the door do not
tyet enter the mall, their focus on the raiders now. From other
tentrances Zombies start converging on the parking lot.

655tAcross the lot, the bikers rev their engines ready to make a run
ton the building. The raiders in the truck hop from the cab. They
trun to the doors, shooting Zombies at they move. Some creatures
tfall, others claw at the runners. One raider is brought down by
tthe ghouls. His friends pay no attention.

656tOne gunman slams into the mall doors to find they are locked.
tHe levels his machine gun on the locks and rips open the
tmechanism. The men push through the doors. The little alarm
tunits are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal.

657tPeter is just slamming down the gates on the balcony when he
thears the alarms go off.

658tOne of the raiders hears the gates rumbling. He looks up and
tsees Peter running by the railing upstairs. He fires with his
tmachine gun.

659tPeter dives, sliding across the balcony. The bullets miss him
tand he crawls around the balcony just out of sight from below.

660tSteve has just slammed down the Hardware Store gate, and makes a
tdash for the Department Store.

661tThe raiders spot him as well, and open fire.

662tSteve runs zip-zag and dives into the big store, where he ducks
tinto the shadows leaving the gate open.

663tPeter, at the balcony railing, levels his super-gun on the
tbikers.

664tOne accurate shot fires and a raider falls with a giant wound in
this chest.

665tThe last raider at the doors ducks out of Peter's sight.

666tSteve now charges the roll gate and slams it shut on the store.

667tThe bikers toward the building. Zombies scatter on the lot.

668tJust as the bikers are reaching the building, the raider inside
trushes the doors. He holds them open as the big fleet of
trumbling cycles comes screaming into the building.

669tSteve is in awe, watching from the Department Store grid.

670tThe cycles pull down the concourse and Zombies lumber in after
tthem. The raider at the door is grabbed by a Zombie. Then
tanother. He manages to fight away.

671tPeter, shooting above, downs the raider and one of the ghouls.

672tThe main band of bikers hear the gunfire and pull down a side
tconcourse to regroup. They make their turn close to the
tDepartment Store and Steve backs into he shadows.

673tPeter moves down the balcony as Zombies are clamouring back to
tthe big concourses. Peter's eyes are wide at the invasion.

674tUpstairs, Fran hears the noises. She is at the top of the
tfirestair, weapons ready. On the landing below, the puppy
tscamper and barks. Fran calls the dog, but it doesn't listen.

675tThe bikes arc around and several pull up to the Dept. Store.

tRaider:t ALRIGHT...COUPLE OF YOU HOLD OFF THEM ZOMBIES...
<b>tttCHARLIE?...HIT THE GATES...WE GOTTA GET THAT
</b><b>tttSNIPER.
</b>
tThe leader rolls out. Others follow. Peter fires and drops a
traider, his bikes flying into the approaching Zombies.

676tThe action is too fast and furious. Neither Peter or Steve can
tsee the whole layout of the concourse.

677tThe lead bikers pulls out of range behind a set of columns. A
tcouple of bikers dismount and start up the stationary stairs.

678tSteve talks into his walkie talkie:

tSteve:tTHEY'RE COMIN' UP, PETER...THEY'RE COMIN'
<b>tttUP THE STAIRS.
</b>
679tPeter moves to another spot on the balcony.

680tSuddenly the raiders at the Dept. Store door turn a machine
tgun on the roll gate locks. One flies open...another...

681tSteve runs into the store, about to charge up the escalator when
the realises he'll be in the line of fire. he runs to the
televator, hits a button, and starts for the second floor.

682tPeter fires and drops one of the charging men on the balcony.
tThe other takes cover. Just as Peter is changing position, the
tlights in the building blink out...the escalators stop... the
tpower has gone off.

683tUpstairs, Fran is alone in total darkness. Below, she hears the
tpuppy still barking. She starts carefully down the steps.

684tIn the stuck elevator, Steve gropes and fumbles for his talk box.

tSteve:tPETER...PETER...

685tThe big trooper charges through the darkness to the Maintenance
tcorridor, ignoring the buzzing on his talk unit.

686tThe raiders on the balcony approach quickly, ducking against the
twalls occasionally for cover.

687tThe other bikers spill into the Dept. Store, raiding the
tcounters and raping the displays. They throw things into sacks
twhile others move to different stores and shoot off roll gate
tlocks. They raid the arsenal in the Sporting Goods store.

688tThe main pack of bandits are holding off the Zombies. The
tcreatures charge with new vigour. Some raiders fall and the
tghouls pounce on them, ripping flesh with teeth and hands.

689tThe van pulls up outside the doors and two bikers ride out to
tit, loading supplies into it. The Zombies are everywhere, but
tthe actions of the professional looters befuddle them.

690tSeveral creatures move onto the balcony. One Zombie pounces the
traider Peter shot and tears at his body.

691tAs remaining raiders appear at the mouth of the corridor, Peter
topens fire, killing the lead raider with a clean shot in the
theart. The man flies back over the railing, falling to the
tconcourse below where Zombies attack it. The other raider falls
tback against the wall.

692tPeter dashes into the Maintenance Room and rushes to throw the
temergency power switch.

693tThe portable emergency light units blink on all over the mall.

694tSteve, who has crawled through the escape hatch of the elevator,
tsuddenly feels the car move. He grabs onto the cables but his
thands slip from grease and his rifle falls down and wedges
tbetween the wall of the shaft and the moving car.

tSuddenly, the car stops again, and Steve sees through the
tescape hatch as light spills in as the main elevator doors open.
tHe thinks to jump down, but hears raiders below.

695tTwo of the big, greasy bandits charge into the car. They whoop
tand shout as they see the open escape hatch.

696tSteve settles back out of sight against the wall.

697tRaider:t COME ON, MAN...LET'S GO...

tThe other raider whoops loudly and fires a barrage of bullets
tinto the escape hatch.

698tThe shells bang and clatter in the shaft and ricochet off the
twalls and gears. A shell nicks Stephen's arm, but he is silent.

699tFinally, the barrage stops. The raiders charge back to the
tstore.

700tOther bandits battle with Zombies. The men crash through
tstores, collecting weapons, ammunition, tools, clothes, food.

701tBikers shuttle goods out to the side doors of the van. The
twoman in the front seat is ready with giant pistols. Zombies
ttry to pound their way in, but they cannot succeed.

702tIn the mall, another biker drops to the Zombies. They pounce
ton him and start devouring his screaming body.

703tSeveral creatures now wander through the Department Store,
thaving entered from the second storey gate. They move through
taisles knocking against displays. One grabs a mannequin thinking
tit human, throws the dummy aside roughly.

704tThe raider on the balcony is approached by several Zombies. He
truns down the corridor to the Maintenance office. Peter is gone.
tBreaking into the various empty offices, the raider comes to the
tfake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere. Then he hears the
tfaint barking of the dog. He checks the panel again by running
this hand along the edge.

tSuddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns. There
tare three ghouls coming. He fires and knocks off the ghouls one
tat a time and runs onto the balcony.

705tBikes roar this way and that. It is a war zone.

706tThe man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above.
tHe spins and looks up. He sees Peter just too late.

707tThe big Trooper, in an open ceiling grid, aims his super-gun
tsquarely at the raider's head. The gun roars and the man flies.

708tBelow, the raiders are starting to regroup. The bikes begin to
tpeel out of the mall entrance one at a time.

709tAnother raider is snatched off his machine by the Zombies.

710tThe bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman
tdriver gets ready to pull out. She lowers her window and fires
tpoint blank at the heads of the clutching creatures.

711tThe last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance. The
tZombies are mobbing around the bikes outside. The men shoot and
tbeat their way to the cycles. One man is brought down, but three
tmanage to mount their cycles. The big bikes roar out.

712tPeter is crawling through the ductwork. Just as he opens a grid,
the sees the last bike rolling across the concourse. He levels
toff with his scope.

713tHe shoots one raider out of the saddle. Two others get out.

714tRegrouping in the lot, the band of twenty is now seven or eight.

715tOne last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the
tconcourse. He dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance.
tHe is the leader. The one who was on the radio. He whoops
tvictorious just as he is about to drive through the doors.

716tPeter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross-hairs on
tthe back of the riders head. He waits as the biker roars out
tonto the lot. The rider lets out one last victorious shout in
tthe fresh air. Peter's scope is locked on the riders back and
tthe super-gun roars. The biker is blown off his machine.

717tThe bike flies into a pack of Zombies. Some fall back, but
tothers advance on the rider. The man rolls over the cement,
tstops, not dead yet. He screams wildly as they move onto him.

718tThe other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade
taway.

719tThe puppy stops barking. Fran is tense in the darkness clutching
ther rifle. She stands on the now silent landing.

720tIn the parking lot and main concourse the Zombies move freely.
tThey fight over the remains of the corpses. They eat ravenously,
tthe sounds of their feast the only thing in the area.

721tPeter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork.
tSuddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit, hits the button.

tSteve:tPETER!

tPeter:tWHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

tSteve:tIN THE ELEVATOR!

tPeter:tLISTEN, THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
<b>tttCLIMB UP TOP...I'LL GET YOU OUT THE GRID ON
</b><b>tttTHE SHAFT...I'M COMIN.
</b>
tPeter starts to crawl through the ducts.

722tSteve hits the second floor button and the car moves. He
tclamours up on the hand rail on the car. His hands reach up and
tgrab the escape hatch pulling his head and shoulders out the
topening. He kicks with his legs to force himself up when the car
tstops. He sees the grid in the shaft wall.

723tSuddenly, the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly
tseveral Zombies dart into the car. They claw at Steve's legs and
tpull him out of the hatch. He screams, thrashes violently.

724tIn the duct, Peter hears the screams. He stops and listens for a
tmoment. He backs away heading for the Maintenance corridor.

725tIn the elevator, Steve thrashes with all his might. The ghouls
ttry to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open and
tclose repeatedly against the creatures which block it.

tA Zombie bites Steve's arm, another bites his neck. The man
tscrambles to unholster his gun. Although he is bleeding
tprofusely, he finally pulls his gun and fires...once...twice...

726tPeter is dropping out of the washroom duct. He hears the pistol
tshots and realises Steve is not dead. He thinks about climbing
tback in the grid, but stops. He punches at the wall violently.
tHe is angry and confused.

727tAgain the pistol roars and rips through a Zombie head, flying
tout of the elevator. The doors still slam against the last
tcreature and Steve fires. The Zombie flies back and the doors
tfinally close.

728tOutside, Zombies fall against the elevator doors.

729tInside, Steve falls to the floor. His neck runs red. His eyes
tare wide with terror. He sits stupidly staring at the pistol in
this hand. He finds it hard to breathe.

730tPeter appears at the bottom of the firestair. The puppy runs to
tmeet him, tails wagging and yapping. He hangs his head as Fran
tlooks down.

tFran:tNO.....NO!

tShe runs down the steps. The big Trooper catches her bodily as
tshe is about to charge out into the hall.

tPeter:tI HEARD HIS GUN...MAYBE HE'S ALRIGHT...WE'LL
<b>tttWAIT...WE'LL JUST WAIT A WHILE...
</b>
731tThe mall stands silent in the blue haze of impending dawn.

732tZombies move through the building freely, walking the halls,
tlumbering through the stores.

733tSeveral creatures still pound and scratch the elevator doors.
tAs they push each other, one creature inadvertently makes
tcontact with the elevator call button.

tThe doors glide open. Steve is standing, his blood dry now.
tHis eyes are blank as he steps forward. The creatures step
taway seeing that he is no longer prey...he is among them now.

tThe doors slam against Steve and open again. Steve lumbers into
tthe store down the aisle. Other creatures drift away.

734tUpstairs, Fran is packing her sack slowly and ponderously. Her
tface is red from crying.

735tPeter stands at the stair top looking down at the landing.

736tFran sets the sack down at the escape ladder leading to the
troof. She deliberately goes to fill another sack.

737tOn the mall balcony, Stephen's corpse walks to the Maintenance
tcorridor. He looks past other wandering Zombies and sees the
tfake partition. Something in him remembers. He moves forward.

738tFran:tIT'S ALMOST LIGHT...LET'S GO.

tPeter looks at her silently from the stairway door.

tFran:tHE DOESN'T ANSWER THE RADIO...IT'S BEEN HOURS...

tShe starts to cry again.

tFran:tFOR GOD SAKE. YOU BETTER COME ON BECAUSE IF
<b>tttI GET TO THINKIN' ABOUT THIS, I'LL JUST GO ON
</b><b>tttDOWN THERE AND LET THEM...LET THEM...
</b>
tThe puppy suddenly growls. It charges between Peter's feet and
truns floppily down the steps.

739tIn the hallway, Steve pounds at the fake wall. Other creatures
tnotice and they all move toward the partition.

740tUpstairs, the pounding can be heard. Peter stands stoically,
tlooking down into the darkness. The dog barks below.

tFran:tWHAT IS IT?

tPeter:tIT'S STEPHEN...THEY'RE COMIN' UP!

741tWith a great crunching noise the partition gives way from the
tarmy of creatures.

742tPeter slams the door. He speaks quietly.

tPeter:tGO ON...YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

tFran:tPETER...

tPeter:tI SAID...GET OUT OF HERE.

tFrom the firestair, we hear the sudden yelping of the puppy as
tit falls victim to the creatures. The sound echoes through the
tbarren spaces of the storage area.

tFran:tOH, JESUS, PETER...PLEASE...

tPeter:tI DON'T WANT TO GO...I REALLY DON'T...
<b>tttYOU KNOW THAT? I REALLY DON'T.
</b>
743tSuddenly, the door flies open and the creatures lumber into the
tliving space. Peter stares at them. He smiles slightly. The
tcreatures advance, led by Stephen.

744tFran starts to scream.

tFran:tSTEPHEN...STEPHEN...

tShe makes a slight move for her lover, but Peter raises his
tsuper-gun and shoots the Zombie through the head.

tAs Stephen falls, Fran comes up short. The act startles her into
tawareness. Peter faces her as the creatures come up behind him.

tPeter:tMOVE, WOMAN!

745tFran grabs the sacks and climbs the ladder to the roof.

746tThe creatures advance on Peter. He backs away, trying to lead
tthem from the skylight. They crash through the living space,
tupsetting the carefully planned room.

747tOn the roof, Fran desperately starts the helicopter engine.

748tPeter backs into the storage room, slamming the door. The
tcreatures approach the door and the super-gun roars one last
ttime. The Zombies push through the door and move in for their
tfeast.

749tSeveral zombies manage to scramble up the skylight to the roof.

tFran stares, transfixed. The blades roar up to full speed.

tThe creatures advance toward the machine.

tFran steps out onto the running board; the creatures very close
tnow. She crouches, watching for a moment, then looks up at the
tspinning blades.

tShe stands straight up, driving her head into the spinning
tblades.

tA headless form falls to the roof. The Zombies advance.

750tIn a wide shot, silhouetted against the dawn sky, we see the
tcreatures huddled under the chopper blades, feasting on their
tlast victim.

tThe credits crawl up.

tJust as the credits end...

tthe engine of the helicopter sputters...
