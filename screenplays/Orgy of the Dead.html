tCLOSEUP of HEAVY RIVETED IRON DOORS with round handles
tcovered by spider webs.

tTwo "GIANTS", wearing leopard-skin shorts, iron bicep-bands and
theadbands, pull the heavy iron doors open revealing the
tINTERIOR of the MAUSOLEUM.  There is an ornate stone sarcophagus
tin the center of the room, raised up on an altar.  The back wall
thas a mantle with a bust of the Virgin Mary looking downward at
tthe coffin.  There is a round red window in the center of the 
twall.  A ray of red light shines through the window, 
tilluminating the misty fog hanging in the air.

tThe giants walk into the Mausoleum.  They lift the heavy stone
tlid off of the coffin, revealing CRISWELL.  He is lying in the
tcoffin on his back, with his arms crossed over his chest and 
teyes closed.  He is wearing black suit pants, a white shirt, a
tblack ribbon-like bow-tie, and a black satin cape.

<b>FADE IN.
</b>
<b>EXT. HIGHWAY IN WILDERNESS.  "NIGHT"
</b>
tA CONVERTIBLE is driving along a DESERT ROAD.  LONG SHOTS of
tthe automobile driving are filmed in bright sunlight.  The
tdesert hills are clearly visible in the background, with only
ta slight darkening to suggest day-for-night, but the car's
theadlights are on so we clearly understand that it is pitch
tblack in the dead of night.
<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tMEDIUM SHOT - BOB AND SHIRLEY IN CAR.  NIGHT
</b>
tBOB and SHIRLEY are seated in the CONVERTIBLE, driving through
tthe night, on a "date".  They are searching for an ancient
tCEMETERY.  MEDIUM SHOTS have a pitch black background and dark
tshadows across the car.

tShirley is leaning over in her seat toward Bob, who is
tdriving.
<b>t 
</b><b>t   tttSHIRLEY
</b> tt  tWe sure picked the wrong night
tttto find a cemetery.  Let's turn
tttback.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttNo.  It's on a night like this
tttwhen the best ideas come to mind.

<b>t   tttSHIRLEY
</b>tttBut does it have to be in a
tttcemetery?

<b>ttttBOB
</b>tttYou wouldn't understand.  Seeing
ttta cemetery on a night like this
tttcan stir in the mind the best
tttideas for a good horror story.

<b>t   tttSHIRLEY
</b>tttBut there're so many wonderful
tttthings to write about, Bob.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>tttSure there are--and I've tried
tttthem all.  Plays, love stories,
tttwesterns, dog stories.  Huh, 
tttnow there was a good one, that 
tttdog story all about--

<b>t   tttSHIRLEY
</b>ttt    (interrupting)
tttBut horror stories!  Why all the
ttttime horror stories?

<b>ttttBOB
</b>tttShirley, I wrote for years 
tttwithout selling a single word.

tBob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around 
tShirley, who leans closer against him.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>tttMy monsters have done well for 
tttme.  You think I'd give that up 
tttjust so I could write about 
ttttrees, or dogs, or daisies?  
tttHuhuh--Daisies!  That's it, 
tttI'll write about my creatures 
tttwho are pushing up the daisies.

tShirley looks up at Bob and smiles.  He tilts his head down and 
tthey kiss.
<b> tt   ttBOB
</b>tttYour puritan upbringing holds
tttyou back from my monsters, but
tttit certainly doesn't hurt your
tttart of kissing.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttThat's life.  My kisses are
tttalive.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttWho's to say my monsters 
tttaren't alive?tt   ttt

tLONG SHOT of the car driving down the road

tCUT back to MEDIUM SHOT of Bob and Shirley

<b>ttttBOB
</b>tttAll of my books are based on 
tttfact, or legend.  Thats perhaps 
tttwhy they're more interesting 
tttand sell in the top spots.

<b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttWell, fact or not, I don't 
tttsee how we're going to find 
tttan ancient cemetery in these 
tttmountains tonight.  I can't 
tttsee a thing!  Let's turn back.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>tttThere's an old cemetery on
tttthis road. I've been there 
tttbefore.

tLONG SHOT of car driving up a desert road with a sandy
tmountain in the background.

<b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttI'm getting the jitters!  
tttLet's turn back!

<b>ttttBOB
</b>ttt   (reluctantly)
tttOkay.

tBob takes his arm from around Shirley and puts it back on the 
twheel.

<b>ttttBOB
</b>tttJust as soon as I find a 
tttplace wide enough to turn 
tttaround.

tCLOSEUP of CAR INTERIOR - DASHBOARD.

tCUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

<b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttNot so fast!

tWe hear sounds of tires squealing on the road.

tCLOSEUP of car wheel racing along the road.

tCUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

<b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>ttt    (desperately)
tttNot so fast!

tCLOSEUP - CAR PEDALS.  Bob steps hard on the brake,
tthen pumps the brake repeatedly.

tCUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley.  Shirley screams
tand hides her face with her hands.

tZOOM IN on a high dirt bank at the roadside, then the screen
tswirls and spins quickly to suggest a dizzying automobile 
tcrash.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
tBob and Shirley are lying on their backs, unconcsious,
ton the ground.  The ground is covered by scattered leaves.  
tMisty fog swirls over them.
tttt(beat)
tShirley wakes up and sits upright groggily.  She looks 
taround, then looks down at Bob.  She moves toward him and
tcradles his head in her lap.
<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
</b>
tCemetery is filled with fog.  We see a large stone throne
tframed by ornate columns, with an altar beneath it.  There 
tare tombstones in the background, and skulls and bones on 
tthe ground.

tCAMERA PANS RIGHT across a small clearing to the MAUSOLEUM.

<b>ttttCRISWELL (VO)
</b>tttIt is said on clear nights, 
tttbeneathtthe cold light of the 
tttmoon, howl the dog and the wolf, 
tttand creeping things crawl out
tttof the slime.  It is then the 
tttghouls feast in all their
tttradiance.

tThe Mausoleum doors creak open on their own, and Criswell <!emerges> 
tquickly stalks out across the clearing, hiding his face 
tbehind his long black cape which is held up with his bent 
telbow against his face, in Dracula fashion.

ttttCRISWELL (VO - Continuing)
tttIt is on nights like this most
tttpeople prefer to steer clear of,
tttuh, <b>Burial Grounds</b>. It is on 
tttnights like this, that the 
tttcreatures are said to appear, 
tttand to <b>walk</b>!

<b>ttttttt    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tMEDIUM SHOT, CRISWELL CLIMBING ONTO HIS THRONE
</b><b>t
</b>tCriswell walks up the steps to the altar, across the altar, 
tand then sits down on the stone seat.  He then slowly lowers 
this cape from his face and regally looks off to the right 
t(at his cue card).t  t 

<b>ttttCRISWELL
</b>tttThe day is gone, the night is
tttupon us, and the moon, which 
tttcontrols all of the underworld, 
tttonce again shines...in radiant 
tttcontentment.
tttt(beat)
tttCome forth, come forth, o
tttPrincess of Darkness.

tCriswell repeatedly beckons slowly toward himself with his 
tright hand, staring across the clearing at the mausoleum.

tThe PRINCESS OF DARKNESS is standing in front of the 
tMausoleum.  She walks into the clearing with an entrancing 
tdemeanor, her arms outstretched straight in front of her.  
tShe is wearing a long black low-cut dress with long open 
tsleeves.  The sleeves are lined with red and hang down a
tcouple feet from her wrists.  She walks slowly over toward
tCriswell's throne.

tThe Princess of Darkness stands beside Criswells throne, 
tcrosses her forearms in front of her chest, and bows toward 
thim.  He nods toward her.  She reaches out and places her 
tleft hand on Criswell's right hand.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCRISWELL (VO)
</b>tttTime seems to stand still.  Not 
tttso the ghouls, when a night of 
tttPleasure is at hand!

tCriswell continues to hold the Princess of Darkness's hand, 
tand she looks at him seductively.

<b>ttttCRISWELL
</b>tttIf I am not pleased by tonight's
tttentertainment, I shall banish 
ttttheir souls to everlasting 
tttdamnation!

tThe Princess of Darkness again crosses her arms in front of 
ther chest and slowly bows to Criswell.

tCUT TO shot of the FULL MOON with dramatic cymbals crashing,
tthen back.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCRISWELL
</b>tttAnd who is to be first?

tThe Princess of Darkness claps twice, summoning the first of 
tthe night's entertainers.  These poor souls must dance for 
tCriswell's approval.  If he is pleased, they can continue to 
tentertain him for centuries, but if not, they will be banished 
tto everlasting damnation by the All-powerful Criswell.

tLONG SHOT OF THE CLEARING.  Huge flames rise from the ground 
tin front of the clearing.  The INDIAN GIRL enters the clearing 
tand begins to Dance.  She is wearing a red Native American-
tstyle dress and headband.

<b>ttttPRINCESS OF DARKNESS
</b>tttOne who loved flames.  Her lover
tttwas killed by flames.  She died 
tttin flames.

tThe INDIAN GIRL DANCE begins.<!  The Indian Girl's dress has 
tsuddenly disappeared, leaving her only with a bikini bottom,
ther headband, and her moccasins.  The clothes of almost all 
tthe dances disappear in a similar fashion.>

tThe Indian Girl dances around for awhile, then dances away 
tinto the foggy background.

<b>EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
tBob slowly wakes up and sits up.  Bob and Shirley look 
taround.

<b>EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
</b>
tThe Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the 
tmausoleum and begins to speak without moving her lips!  A 
tmarvel of filmmaking art.

<b>ttttPRINCESS OF DARKNESS 
</b>ttt    (out of sync with picture)
tttOne who prowls the lonely streets
tttat night in life is bound to prowl 
tttthem in eternity.

tThe STREET WALKER DANCE begins.  The STREET WALKER walks 
tinto the clearing wearing a pink dress and purple feather 
tboa, and beckons with her finger as if to say, "Come here, 
tCriswell!"

<b>EXT. WOODS.  NIGHT.
</b>
tAt the car accident scene with Bob and Shirley, slow jazz 
tmusic is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery. 
tBob and Shirley are still sitting on the ground, looking 
ttoward the source of the music.

<b>ttttCRISWELL (VO)
</b>tttAhh, the curiousity of youth...
ttton the road to ruin!  May it 
tttever be so adventurous!
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttI'm so frightened.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttWell we certainly can't stay 
ttthere. C'mon.t
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttWhere?
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttIn there.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttIt frightens me.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttSilly, there's nothing in 
tttthere to be afraid of.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttThen..then what's that music?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttThat's what I want to find out.  
tttWe have to get help.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttWhat help can we possibly find 
tttin the cemetery at this time of 
tttnight?
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttSomething's making that music.
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttI'm not sure I care to find out
tttwhat it is.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttAll right.  Don't worry, I'll
tttbe right beside you.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttWhat help will that do if 
tttsomething in there isn't dead?
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttNot dead?  In a cemetery?
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttI can't imagine anything dead 
tttplaying that music.
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttWell, it's probably just the
tttcaretaker, and that's exactly 
tttwho we want to find.  They'll 
ttthave a telephone.  C'mon.
<b>tttt
</b>tBob helps Shirley up from the ground and leads her into the 
tthick bushes.

<b>EXT. CEMETERY, NIGHT
</b>
tCriswell nods repeatedly, smiling at the dancer in approval.
tThe Street Walker's clothes have suddenly disappeared.

tBob and Shirley creep beneath the bushes, crouched down low.  
tThey reach the edge of the clearing where Criswell and the 
tPrincess of Darkness are watching the Street Walker Dance.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttCould it be some kind of 
tttcollege initiation?
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttIt's an initiation all right, 
tttbut not of a college as you 
tttand I know them.  Nothing 
tttalive looks like that!
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttCan't we get out of here?
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttI'm not sure...
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tttWhat do you mean?
<b>tttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttI'm not sure, myself. It's 
tttjust a feeling I've had 
tttsince the crash...Like I 
tttfeel a cold chill all over..
ttt..Now this!

tThe Street Walker dances with a Skeleton that is hanging by 
tthe door of the mausoleum.

tThe Street Walker dance ends.

<b>ttttCRISWELL
</b>tttI would see for approval, the
tttone who in life worshipped 
tttgold above all else.

tThe Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the
tmausoleum again to start off the next dance.

tThe giants walk to the doors, now wearing red and white
thorizontal-striped miniskirts (or ancient egyptian garb?). 
tThey pull the iron doors open slowly, and we see the GOLD 
tGIRL DANCER lying on her back on the altar inside.

<b>ttttSHIRLEY
</b>tt       (pointing toward the mausoleum)
tttLook!
<b>ttt
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>tttBe careful!--They'll see you.

tThe Gold Girl Dancer rises slowly and seductively from the 
ttable, then stalkingly dances out into the clearing.  She is 
twearing a metallic gold tunic-like dress.

tWe see a shot of Bob and Shirley watching, and suddenly the 
tGold Girl's dress has disappeared.

tThe Gold Girl Dance continues.

<b>ttttCRISWELL
</b>tttThrow gold at her.
<b>tttt
</b>tThe giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin 
tslowly sprinkling them over the Gold Girl as she dances. 
tShe sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins.


<b>ttttCRISWELL
</b>tttMore gold.
<b>tttt
</b>tThe giants continue dropping gold coins on the Gold Girl.  
tShe picks up the gold coins, rubbing them over her body, 
tin ecstasy.

<b>ttttCRISWELL
</b>ttt       (excitedly)
tttMore gold!

tThe giants continue, to the delight of Criswell.  The Gold 
tgirl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCRISWELL
</b>ttt      (impatiently)
tttMore gold!

tThe giants continue.  Criswell is thrilled, and begins to 
tLAUGH loudly.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCRISWELL
</b>ttt    (to the Princess)
tttFor all eternity, she shall 
ttthave gold.

tThe Princess of Darkness laughs in acknowledgement, then 
tclaps her hands twice, commanding the Giants to finish the
tceremony.
<b>t
</b>tThe Giants walk toward the Gold Girl, who is still on the 
tground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her 
tbody.  The giants pick up the Gold Girl, who resists, trying 
tto maintain contact with the gold.  She reaches for it as 
tthey lift her up.
<b>t
</b>tCLOSEUP of a BUBBLING GIANT CAULDRON full of a substance that 
tis supposed to look like gold.
<b>t
</b>tThe Giants dip the Gold Girl feet first into the cauldron,
tsubmerging her entire body.
<b>t
</b>tA few seconds later, the giants lift the Gold Girl out of the 
tcauldron.  Her body is now entirely gilded, and she is stiff. 
tThey lift her onto their shoulders, carrying her like a board, 
twalking in front of Criswell's throne, then back into the 
tmausoleum, laying her body on the altar.
<b>t
</b>tWe see Bob and Shirley, looking dismayed.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCRISWELL (VO)
</b>tttAnd both couldn't help but 
tttremember a line from one of 
tttBob's stories:  "A sudden wind 
ttthowls.  The night things are 
tttall about me.  Every shadow, a
tttbeckoning invitation...to 
tttdisaster.  I know I should 
tttthink of other things, of 
tttpleasant things, but I can't. 
tttHow can I think of other things, 
tttof pleasant things, when I am 
tttin a place surrounded by 
tttshadows and objects, which can 
ttttake any shape, here in the 
tttdarkness...Any shape my mind 
tttcan conceive."

tDeep in the woods, we see THE WOLF MAN and THE MUMMY, walking 
tquickly.

tSuddenly, Bob and Shirley are grabbed from behind by the WOLF 
tMAN and the MUMMY.  The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and 
tShirley over to the clearing near Criswell's throne.
<b>t
</b>tThe Princess of Darkness is now seated at Criswell's right 
tside with him on his throne.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttCRISWELL
</b>tttBring 'em in!

tThe Princess of Darkness stands and walks to the end of the 
taltar below Criswell's throne, then sits on the lower seat at 
tthe end of the altar and crosses her legs.

tThe Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and Shirley over to the 
tcenter of the clearing to face Criswell, The Sole Ruler of 
tthe Dark World.

tCriswell again.
<b>tt
</b>tThe CAT GIRL DANCE begins.

t<!(The CAT GIRL actually dances out of her costume, rather

tCUT TO interior of the stone mausoleum.  The Ancient Egyptian 
tSLAVE GIRL is chained from her wrists to a high hook on the 
twall.  One of the "giants" pretends to whip her with a cat

tThe Camera zooms back and we see that the Wolf Man and The

this hand up to his ear so he can hear what Bob and Shirley

tThe Wolf Man and The Mummy then creep over toward Criswell's

tThe Wolf Man whispers into The Princess of Darkness's ear while

tThe Princess of Darkness gets up from the throne and walks over

tunbuttons Shirley's blouse, then marks Shirley's abdomen with 
ta red (blood?) cross using her long sharp fingernail.

tShirley screams.

tThe Princess of Darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt

tThe Princess of Darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in

tThe Princess of Darkness takes the skull from Criswell and

</b>tttI don't like snakes.  I remember

tCriswell.

tThe SKELETON DANCE GIRL, wearing a white dress and long

</b>tThe Princess of Darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with 
ther long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, 
tgazing back at Criswell seductively.  She finally gets to 
tShirley and cuts the button off of Shirley's shirt, which 
twas so tight it was about to burst open anyway.  She unsnaps 
tthe front of Shirley's bra.
<b>t
</b>tBob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a "move," merely
tstepping forward.  He is instantly hammer-fisted on the back 
tof the neck by The Wolf Man, and falls down unconscious.
<b>t
</b>tThe Princess of Darkness raises her long dagger high above 
tShirley's head.  But suddenly, the sun rises (it is already 
thigh overhead), and the night creatures lose their power.  The 
tPrincess of Darkness clings to Shirley's arm, as she slowly 
tsinks down to the ground, losing all strength.
<b>t

tback to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming

tAt the clearing in the woods near the car wreck, Bob and

twere after the crash, before they got up to investigate the
