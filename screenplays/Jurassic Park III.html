<b>1 tEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN x96 DAYt1
</b>
tA speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the
tlooming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.


<b>2 tEXT. BOAT - DAY ttttttt2
</b>
tIllegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps
tAmericans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --
talready wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two-
tperson PARASAIL HARNESS.


<b>3 tEXT. BOAT - DAY ttttttt3
</b>
tBen and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over
tthe back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou make sure to get us as close as you can,
ttokay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a 
ttlittle extra. 

<b>ttttENRIQUE
</b>ttDon't worry. I take you close. But not too 
ttclose.
ttt(rubbing Eric's head)
ttYou don't want them to eat you.

tEnrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND
tWINCH bolted to the deck.

<b>ttttENRIQUE (CONT'D)
</b>ttReady, amigos?

tBen and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the
tcamcorder to the record the action.

tEnrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the
tspeedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the 
trolling ocean.

tStrapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing
twater, intently watching for Enrique's signal.

tAs the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.

tBen grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and
tEric braces themselves.

tEnrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls
tthe winch, Ben yanks the cord and - 

tWOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,
thoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the
tparasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR."

tTHE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.

tBEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.

tENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain 
theight, he LOCKS OFF the reel.

tHigh overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet
tsplendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.

tDown below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

tEric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the
tcamera.

tThen, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,
twhich now dangles from his neck.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttWhat was that?

tA second tug...and now the faintest of screams.

tBen and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
tinto the low bank of FOG.

tBy the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR
tIS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.

tAs Ben considers the driverless boat...

<b>ttttERIC (CONT'D)
</b>ttBen!

tBen glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something 
tbelow. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only
tmoments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF.

tSticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered
tby waves.

tAS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a
tnumber of pieces.

tA panicked Ben turns to Eric.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttUnclip your line!

tEric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an
tupdraft, the parasailers float upward.

tA strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
tof ISLA SORNA...


<b>4 tEXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY ttttt4
</b>
tTWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied
tby a child's ferocious sounds.

<b>ttttCHILD (O.S.)
</b>
<b>ttRRRRROW! GRRRRRR!
</b>
<b>tWINDER TO REVEAL -
</b>
tCHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his
tfavorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and
twatches with great delight.

tELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a
tpicture of the perfect family.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttOh, actually, Charlie, those two are
ttherbivores. They wouldn't be interested in
ttfighting each other. But these...
ttt(picking up two other dinosaurs)
ttSee, these are carnivores. And this one here
tt-- see its claws -- this one here uses its
ttclaws to gouge at the throat of its opponentx85

tAs Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his
town, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttUh, Alan?


<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttHmm?

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttHe's three. Why don't you wait till he's a
ttlittle older?


<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttOh, right.
ttt(back to Charlie)
ttHappy dinosaurs.

tHe bounces them along the sandbox edge.

tThen, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door
tSLAMMING is heard.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttThat must be Mark.
ttt(calling out)
ttMark, wex92re back here!

tEllie and Grant turn to see --

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,
tbalance demeanor.

tHe and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.

<b>ttttELLIE (CONT'D)
</b>ttGood day?

<b>ttttMARK
</b>ttKeeping the world safe.
ttt(re: baby)
ttHere, let me take her.

tEllie hands off the baby.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttMark, this is Alan Grant.

<b>ttttMARK
</b>ttNice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about
ttyou.

tThe two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant
twho is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to
this father, showing his dinosaur.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDaddy, this is a herbabore.

tGrant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.


<b>5 tINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT ttttt5
</b>
tWINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing 
the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttWhat's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
ttname Alan? Say my name.

ttThe bird doesn't respond.

<b>ttttGRANT (CONT'D)
</b>ttHe used to know me.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttSorry, Alan it's been six years.

tGrant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.
tThe three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The
tThe children have been out to bed.

tAn awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --

<b>ttttMARK
</b>ttMore coffee?

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttt(relived)
ttYes. Great.

tMark stands and collects their cups.

<b>ttttELLIE (CONT'D)
</b>ttSo, Mark's working at the State Department
ttnow.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttReally? 
(To Mark)
What do you do there?

<b>ttttMARK
</b>ttt(with mock bravado)
ttI could tell you about it, but than I'd have to
ttkill you.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttIndeed.

tMark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another
tuncomfortable silence.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>tSo what are you working on now?

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>
tWe have a new site in Montana. At least until
tthe money runs out.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttAnything good?

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttRaptors, mostly.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttMy favorite.

tGrant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he
tcan talk to about this.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttYou remember the sounds they made?

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttI try not to.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttWe've done cranial scans, and raptors
ttactually had a quite sophisticated
ttresonating chamber. I have a theory that
tttheir ability to vocalize is the key to their
ttsocial intelligence. The way they can work
tttogether as a team.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttYou think they could talk to each other?

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttTo a degree we never imagined.

tAnd from the cage in the corner of the room...

<b>ttttJACK
</b>ttBullshit!

tBoth look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttYou taught him that.


<b>6 tEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT ttttt6
</b>
tEllie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the
tdriveway.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttGood luck with the fund raising.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttIt was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
ttyou could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils
ttare out. Everyone wants to see a real live
ttdinosaur.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttTimes change Alan. But you're the still the
ttbest. I mean that.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttThe last of my breed.

tA long moment passes between them as both consider where
tthey've ended up.

<b>ttttGRANT (CONT'D)
</b>ttI'd better get going.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttLet me know if I can help, Alan. Youx92re bad
ttabout asking for help, but please ask me.
ttAnything, anytime.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttt(deep down knowing he never
ttt will)
ttOkay. Goodbye, Ellie.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttGoodbye, Alan.

tNot sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with
ta friendly hug. They keep it short.

tGrant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.

tHe's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls
tit down.

<b>ttttELLIE (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhen I met you, I thought that one day
ttmillions of years ago, all the dinosaurs
ttbecame extinct. Wiped out. But you told me
ttotherwise. When conditions changed,
ttdinosaurs changed. They became other things.
ttThey evolved.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttA well-accepted theory.

<b>ttttELLIE
</b>ttt(simply)
ttAlan don't be afraid to evolve.

tGrant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.
tA forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.

tEllie watches as he drives off.


<b>7 tINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY tttttt7
</b>
tThe last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public
tlecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and
tSTUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with
tcostumes.

tGrant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some
tATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This
twasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.

tA new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttIt's through the painstaking study of the
ttInterior chamber in multiple specimens that
ttwe can determine this exciting correlation
ttbetween the larynx and the upper plate. That
ttlets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that
ttthe raptor might have been capable of bird-
ttlike vocalizations. Which as you can
ttimagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

tHe's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the
tSYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of
<b>tAPPLAUSE.
</b>
<b>ttttSYMPOSTIUM LEADER
</b>ttThank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does
ttanyone have a question?

tNearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttDoes anyone have a question that doesn't 
ttrelate to Jurassic Park?

tQuite a few hands go down.

ttttGRANT (cont'd)
ttOr the incident in San Diego, which I'll
ttremind you, I did not witness.

tNow most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few
tremaining...

<b>ttttMALE STUDENT
</b>ttYour theory on raptors is good and all, but
ttisn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

tThe STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.

<b>ttttMALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttI mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and
tteveryone decides how to handle the second
ttisland, scientist will just go in and look
ttfor themselves.

<b>ttttTOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
</b>ttIsn't paleontology itself in danger of
ttextinction?

tRecognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is
tabout to step in. But Grant will take this himself.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttNo, and let me be perfectly clear on this
ttpoint. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
ttWhat's left of them is fossilized in stone
ttthe actual scientists spend years to
ttundercover.
<b>tttttttt   (MORE)
</b>
<b>ttttGRANT (CONT'D)
</b>ttwhat John Hammond and InGen created are
tttheme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing
ttless.

ttThe class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

<b>ttttANOTHER STUDENT
</b>ttYou're saying you wouldn't want to study
ttthem if you had the chance?

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttNo force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
ttthat island.


<b>8 tINT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY ttttt8
</b>
tLooking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we
tsee someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
tglass.


<b>9 tEXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY ttttt9
</b>
tNASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is
tpainting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he
ttosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
taway from the plane.

tWe now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It
tlooks absurdly like some angry beast.

tWe are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft
tgraveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.

tWe hear a phone RINGING...


<b>10 tINT. CARGO PLANE - DAY ttttt       10
</b>
tA RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases.

tUDESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 

<b>ttttUDESKY
</b>ttUdesky.
ttt(beat)
ttYes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as
ttsoon as you drop me the payment.

tWith the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the
tcraft...


<b>11 tEXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY ttttt       11
</b>
tUdesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.

tCooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He
tfinishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's
taimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.

<b>ttttUDESKY
</b>ttThat's right, two of the very best I could
ttfind. No, I haven't worked with them
ttpersonally, but they come with the highest
ttrecommendations.

tThen --

tCooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets
tinto the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.

tNash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.

<b>ttttUDESKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou've got nothing to worry about, sir. This
ttis going to be a piece of cake.

tPieces of the demolished craft come raining down.


<b>12 tEXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY t12
</b>
tCLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a
tdinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his
tsweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an
tassociate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.

tLooking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one
tof a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one
tmost smitten with her supervisor.

<b>ttttCHERYL
</b>ttBilly? I don't think I'm doing this right.

tHe scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttYou need to go slowly. See, just take it little
ttat a time.

tShe's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.

<b>ttttCHERYL
</b>ttI can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttTechnically, it's all rock. The calcium in the
ttbones is replaced during fossilization. But
ttyou can feel the difference. See? Rough,
ttsmooth. Rough, smooth.

tHe runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing
ther. After a pause, she runs her finger along his
tstubbly chin...

<b>ttttCHERYL
</b>ttRough.

t...and along his lips.

ttttCHERYL (cont'd)
ttSmooth.

tBilly may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending
tit either. It's then that a

<b>tSHADOW
</b>
tfalls across them. Billy looks up to see...

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttDr. Grant!

tGrant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttMr. Brennan.

<b>ttttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>12AtEXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY ttt12A
</b>
tBilly takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttHow was your trip? Profitable?

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttWe'll be broke in four weeks.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttThree weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

tThe cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". On
ta dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a
tstrange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps
tback and forth across a tray of fine sand.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttYou rented an automated litter box.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttIt's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
ttdata from the raptor skull, than the computer
ttbreaks it into thousands of slices which this
ttthing prints, one layer on top of the other.
ttIt's the future of paleontology.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttNot if it can't dig.

tThe arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping
tthrough holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
ta person's fist.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttI give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

tGrant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the
tresult. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the
tremaining sand.

tBilly puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.
tThe resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an 
tnon-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he
tuses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and
tvariations.

tIn the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.

tBilly looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of t
ta Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the tt
ttent. ttttttttt

ttttBILLY (cont'd) tttt
ttt(falsely casual) ttttt
ttOh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors ttt
ttwanted to come by and talktto you. I 
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
ttmaybe even have dinner with them. tttttt

<b>ttttGRANT ttttt
</b>ttAbsolutely not. tttttt

<b>ttttBILLY tttttt
</b>ttThey're here. ttttttt

<b>ttttGRANT ttttt
</b>ttWhat? tttttttt

tOnly now does Grant realize these two people
Who were walking up to them.
Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.tttt

<b>ttttMAN tttttt
</b>ttDr. Grant? ttttttt

<b>ttttGRANT ttttt
</b>ttYes? tttttttt

<b>ttttMAN tttttt
</b>ttt(extending his hand)ttttt
ttPaul Kirby. Kirby Enterprisestttt t
ttt(reaching into his pocket) t
ttMy card. ttttttt

tPAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist withtttt
tno "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, just
as friendly, is harder to read. There seems to bettt
texhaustion behind her eyes. ttttt

<b>ttttGRANT ttttt
</b>ttWhat can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? tttt

<b>ttttPAUL tttttt
</b>ttWell sir, I am a great admirer
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife 
and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.ttttt

<b>ttttGRANT ttttt
</b>ttYou know, I've been traveling and I'm very tt
tttired. Maybe some other time. tttt

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttI guarantee it'll be worth your while.

tBehind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
ttogether, indicating the guy is loaded.

tGrant musters a weak smile.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttIt's be my pleasure.


<b>13 tINT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT t13
</b>
tTheyx92re only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready to
tbolt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They walk
tover to Paul and Amandax92s table and sit down.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttFirst off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,
ttAmanda and I have admired your work for
ttyears.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttIt is truly, whatx92s the word? Inspiring.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttThank you.

tIt's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperately
twants to leave and get back to his dig.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttAmanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
ttHeck we've been on pretty much any adventure
tttour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,
ttthe Nile...

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttWe even have two seats reserved aboard the
ttfirst commercial moon flight.

tBilly nudges Grant.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttHmmm.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttNow, for our wedding anniversary this year
ttwe wanted to do something really special,
ttsomething...

tHe places his hand on his wife's.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>tt...once-in-a-lifetime.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttWe've arranged for a private airplane to
tttake us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want
ttyou to be our guide.

tThe Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazing
tgift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttThat's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm
ttafraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can
ttrefer you to a number of highly qualified...

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttNo, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've
ttseen these animals in the flesh. No one else
tthas come close to you.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttI'm flattered, but I've taken this little
ttadventure tour. And with the air
ttrestrictions they've imposed after the
ttincident in San Diego, you canx92t fly low
ttenough to see anything of interest.

tPaul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttYou see, that's just the thing. Paul and I
tthave special permission to fly low.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttHow low?

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttWell, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do
ttknow it's hell of a lot lower than anyone
ttelse.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttFrom what I understand, it's pretty much
ttwhatever we want.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttThat's hard to believe.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttLet's just say that through my business --
ttimports/exports, emerging markets -- I've
ttmade some friends in high places. In this
ttcase, the Costa Rican government.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttDr. Grant, you don't know how important it is
ttfor us to have you come along. It would make
ttall the difference.

tGrant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pulls
tout his checkbook.

<b>ttttPUAL
</b>ttAnd of course, we're prepared to make a
ttsizeable contribution to your research here.

tBilly looks at Grant. Don't say no.

ttttPAUL (cont'd)

tinto the air.

tA huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyone
telse SCREAMS now.
<b>t
</b>tThe plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.
<b>t
</b>tThe passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself into
this seat.

tSuddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered this
tway and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
tseats.
<b>t
</b>tFinally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose of
tthe plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF.

tNash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose of
tthe plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below.

tThe passengers hang almost vertically in their seats,

tDebris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it
tstriking Nash in the head.

tUdesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
tcabin. Nash follows.

tSuddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past the
tcockpit seats, opens wide, and

<b>tCLAMPS DOWN
</b>
ton Nash's legs.

tThe pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab onto
this arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosaur
trips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle.

tNash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in
thorror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and 
tdropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snout
tof the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot.

tIt's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away.

tPleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the
tmain course.

tGrant tries to force open the jammed rear door. Billy tries to
thelp, but the door won't budge.

tThe dinosaur JAMS its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
tAmanda in the first row. She yanks her legs back as the jaws
<b>tSNAP SHUT.

tBehind Amanda, Billy reaches forward, UNSNAPS her seat belt
tand pulls her into the next row back.

tThe others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the

tA window near Amanda fogs over with condensation. when it
tclears, she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes.

tThen all hell breaks loose as the plane is SLAMMED across the

tUdesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him the
trest of the way through.

tBilly is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives under

<b>t
</b>tThen a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
tto slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at the
twidening tear.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttThis way!

tGrant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. They
tmake a mad dash for the jungle.

tA tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can't

tGrant spots a grove of

</b>
tand leads the group into it.

tThe dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS at
tthe fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route after
tthem.

tThe group continues their relentless pace, putting as much 
tdistance as they can between themselves and the beast. Paul
tKirby looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Even Billy
tis gasping for air.

tGrant directs the group through some underbrush and into --

tOur friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry.

tBefore them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.

</b>ttDon't worry. It's dead.

tThen a full-grown bull

tGrant FREEZES.

<b>ttttGRANT (CONT'D)
</b>ttNobody move a muscle.

tRemember: the T-Rex tracks motion.

tObeying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesky
ttakes off running.

tAnd T-Rex ROARS.

tEveryone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.


<b>45tEXT. JUNGLE - DAYttttttt45
</b>
tDashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face
tto face with --

<b>tTHE FIRST MONSTER.
</b>
tWe now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
tcreature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and
ttwenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
tback. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth.
tSinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
tfourteen inch claws.

tNowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the
ttwo behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous.

tPaul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in
tthe other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck 
tbetween two branches.

tHe manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach.
tThey'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans.

tGrant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T-
tRex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the
tother's weakness.

tLaying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the
tgiant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
tinches from his face.

tSpinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide.

tT-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small
ttrees as it spins out of the way.

tIn the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover.

tBetween the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his
thands and knees.

tT-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of
tits adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again
tforced to duck for cover.

tAs Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives
tforward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to
tgrip its throat.

tAmanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to
tBilly.

tNow on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes
tat T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally
tkicks the animal with one mammoth foot.

tTyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded.

tDown below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
tdinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans.

tSpinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to
ttopple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
tground.

tWith an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between
tGrant and the rest of the group.

tThe companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the
thead of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them.

tPlastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror
tas T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus
tlatches onto its throat.

tSpinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex
topens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
tfriends.

tFinally, Grant reaches the others.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttCome on!

tSpinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenched
tprofessor leads the group through the undergrowth.


<b>46tEXT. JUNGLE - DAYttttttt46
</b>
tWinded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furious
tGrant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants to
tknow --

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttWhy did you bring us here?

tPaul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, but
tGrant gives him back a look.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttOur son is on this island. We need your help

tStill crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from his
tshirt pocket.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttThis is him. Eric. Hex92s thirteen now. He's
ttjust about the greatest kid in the world.

tLetting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-style
tportrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. He
tshakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy.

tThe group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant and
tBilly -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps in
tplaces.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttHe's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttWho's that?

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttHer new boyfriend.

ttThey never came back.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttWe called everyone, did everything we could.
ttBecause of all the controversy over this

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttThen you duped us into coming here.

<b>ttttPAUL

</b>ttt(disbelieving)
ttI have never been on this island!

ttt(finally)
ttHow many days have they been missing?

tA look between Amanda and Paul.

</b>ttAfter what you've seen today, you really
ttthink your son could be alive?

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttHe's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttNo, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we

tknow Grant is right.

</b>
tThey look to Udesky.

</b>ttWhat do we do?

tUdesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he
ttries to mutter some brio.

<b>ttttUDESKY
</b>ttWell, I think we should start searching for your

</b>ttExcellent.

tThey follow after Grant and Billy.

tThe five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find
tanything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's 
twarnings, they move quickly and quietly.

tUdesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is bent
talmost 90 degrees, unless.

tBilly finds his camera, intact.

tDigging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul steps
taround the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwear
tbefore he notices Amanda is also there changing.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttSorry.

tA beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.

tThey make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks.

tAround the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the

tAnd as they continue forward, Billy spots something in the
ttrees ahead.


<b>49tEXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAYttttt49

tShe grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She tries
tthe power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead.

tUdesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.

<b>ttttUDESKY
</b>ttHere, give that to me.

tconsider the parasail.

</b>ttI think I've got it.

tUdesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the

tHe brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red power

tAmanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head.

tGrant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the
tparasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught on
ta branch.

tThey pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't come

tIt swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS.

tFinally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangle

tReeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick

tShe tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just
tmakes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an arm
taround her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.

</b>ttI'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for

tSaying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them

<b>ttttAMANDA (CONT'D)
</b>ttI guess I was hoping that with Ben around,

tChecking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of the

</b>ttDr. Grant!

tHe nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over,
tGrant at the rear.

tAs he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
tbackpack. He stops short from what he sees.

tLooking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find a
tstrange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches.
tMaybe six feet around.

tJust now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one
tof the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with
tfootball-sized eggs, laid in a spiral.

tAnd this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, laid
tout in an oddly symmetrical pattern.

tThe last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrified
tinstant.

tinto the distance.

tA jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAST
tCOMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alone
tseems to cover several acres.

tThe weary group breathes a sigh of relief.

tThey walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with
tabandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others are
toverturned completely.

tThey're not going to be driving anywhere.

tA troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially caved
tin, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost 
World)

tAnd the group finally approaches the front doors of an
tenormous building. As they head up the front steps, we see
tsomething in the distance behind them:

<b>tCAT-LIKE MOVEMENTS
</b>
ton the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominous
tto dismiss.

tOur friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietly
topulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed
tby the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls.

tIn the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been
tgnawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and filled
tashtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in a

tSudden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in the

</b>ttEric!

tAll listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange a

tSitting on the reception counter is an official-looking
ttelephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares.
tFinally -

<b>ttttAMANDA (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhat the hell.

tAmanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada.

tWith Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building.

tUnseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's
tdirty windows with terrifying speed.


<b>56tINT. CORRIDOR - DAYtttttt56

</b>ttLet's see. I've got about a dollar seventy-

<b>57tINT. HATCHING LABORATORYttttt57
</b>
tGrant and Billy push through a set of doors to see
<b>t
</b><b>tA CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILITY
</b>
tfilled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the
tfirst island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any
tof the facilities seen previously.

tAs the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to
tabsorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic
tfreezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks
tof formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts.

tMachines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside
tconveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttThis is how you make dinosaurs?

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttThis is how you play God.

tBilly looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttOkay if I take pictures?

tGrant nods.

tBilly sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two years
tfrom now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Billy
tdoesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying
tit because there wasn't any room inside.

tBilly pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.

<b>tACROSS THE LAB
</b>
tAmanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-formed
tembryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gone
tawry. Finally she reaches

<b>tA GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEAD
</b>
tfloating in the one tank.

tSomething about this specimen catches Amandax92s attention. She
tbends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers right
tinto the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then --

<b>tAN ACTUAL RAPTOR
</b>
tlunges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS.

tFortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced
ttanks. Amanda runs.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttAmanda!

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttBack out! Move!

tAnd as the group races through the lab the Raptors find a
tlarger gap between the tanks.


<b>58tINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAYtttt58
</b>
tPaul leads the way, checking the door for possible escape
troutes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind,

<b>tTHE RAPTOR

tdoor.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttIn here!


<b>59tINT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAYtttt59

tThe group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the
troom.

tThere are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently
tused for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors are
tstanding open.

tThe group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the raptor
tBURSTS into the room, ROARS.

tAs the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the
topen cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.

tGrant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can
tswing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS
tinto it, driving the door into the cage.

tThey are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a
tsmall triangle space by the advancing door. The angry
tRaptor is now inches away through the cage door.

tThen, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top
tof their triangular enclose is wide open.

tThe eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the
ttail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttPush!

tThey push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor
tright through the opening of the cage.

tNow the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door
tgoing right to the ceiling.

tAmanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,
ttemporarily trapping the dinosaur.

tThe raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but
tthe cage door seems to be holding.

tAs everyone rushes back to the door.

tThe raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.

tAs the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening
tto the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones as
tcame from the model resonating chamber.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttShe's calling for help.


<b>60tEXT. COMPOUND - DAYtttttt60
</b>
tThe group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
ta large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audible
tas they head for the tree line.

tNow they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters.

tThe responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, they
tsoon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both
tdistant and near.

tGrant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his
ttheory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse
ttime.

tResponding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly
tflees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind the
therd

<b>tA PACK OF RAPTORS
</b>
temerges from the jungles, coming their way.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttHead for the trees!

tFrom the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURSTS
tout one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry we
theard in the lab.

tThe raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MALE
tRAPTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up the
tmiddle.

tGrant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.

ttttGRANT (cont'd)
<b>ttTHIS WAY!
</b>
tIn an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads the
tgroup right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs.

tSuddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the
tgroup.

tLetting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much to
this dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.

tIndeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors
tonly want them.

tIn the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.

tUp ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his
tcamera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's
talready back on his feet and running.

tAmanda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Grant
tspots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past.

tLooking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...

ttree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg.

tTrying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. This
ttime, Paul catchers her.

tBilly climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.

tUdesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
thimself

<b>tHEADED OFF
</b>
tby a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds

<b>tTHERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.
</b>
tHe picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
tapproach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio
tstops, peering at him.

tUdesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,
tanother raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his
tmuscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground.

ttHe's this way.

tFrom here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
t"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
tfrom branch to branch, tree to tree.

<b>tON THE FLOOR
</b>
tUnable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.
tThe effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the
traptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.

tRather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to
tfind him self still alive.

tSuddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's
tdelicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky
tCRIES OUT, louder this time.

<b>tIN THE TREES
</b>
tHearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now
tfinally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely

tIn the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her,
tholds her back.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttIt's not safe.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttWe have to help him.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttHe's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill
ttwounded.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttHe's not a kill, he's still alive.

tShe breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's only
ta foot away from the tree when

<b>tALL FOUR RAPTORS
</b>
tlead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her as
tBilly and Paul pull her back up on the limb

tThe raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttThey couldnx92t climb up, so they were trying
ttto get us to come down.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttThey set a trap
ttt(amazed)
ttThey actually set a trap.

tBored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky,
tmaking a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors are
thorrified and sickened.

tThen, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feasting
traptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark
tjungle.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttWhere's Grant?


<b>69BtEXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAYtttt69B
</b>
tClimbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing
tpack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally
treaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.

<b>tLOOKING DOWN
</b>
tThe entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the
tcenter, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the
tcry, the other raptors CALL BACK.

tAs terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their
tcommunication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,
ta structure. They're clearly talking about something.

tUnder his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttWhat does that mean? What are you saying?

tOf course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
t"phrase."

tReady to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --
the's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered
twith a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's
tthe source. It's oozing out the bottom.

tHe unzips the bag to find

<b>tA BROKEN RAPTOR EGG
</b>
tinside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
tof the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.

tThis is what the raptors where chasing.

<b>ttttGRANT (CONT'D)
</b>ttGod damn you, Billy.

tEver the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of
tdanger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.
tThey suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.

<b>ttttGRANT (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We
ttwant the egg."

tHe gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are
tinterested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means
tplacated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant
tdead.

tThey begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each
totherx92s backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.

tGrant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.
tAnd than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's
ton is starting to give in.

tHe looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be
ttheir next meal. And then,

<b>tA SMALL CANISTER
</b>
tlands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick
tcloud of oily fog. It's the first of

<b>tFIVE CANISTERS
</b>
tthat land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just
tsmoke though something far more caustic.

tAs it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest
tto the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.
tThere may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they
tseem panicked, disoriented.

tPack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take
toff running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet
tblindly.

tThis may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.
tUp in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor
tHe squints to see through the fog, where he spots

<b>tA HUMAN SHAPE
</b>
tat the edge of the smoke

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttCome on! They'll be back!

tGrant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get
tthrough the heaviest of the smoke.

<b>tA SMALL DIRTY HAND
</b>
tgrabs his, pulling him along.


<b>69CtEXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAYtttttt69C
</b>
tEyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see as
tthe other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identify
this rescuer as

<b>tERIC KIRBY,
</b>
tthe boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the last
teight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthiest
tchild you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him.

tSomething wild.

thimself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit by
ta small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has been
thiding.

tThe minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealing
tthe door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingly
tefficient at staying alive.

<b>ttttGRANT

</b>ttEric, your parents are both here.

tEric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...

</b>ttThey'll never make it. I mean, they can't

tEric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.

</b>ttYou're Alan Grant, aren't you?
ttt(off surprised reaction)
ttI read both of your books.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttWhich one do you prefer?

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttThe first one. Before you where on the island.
ttYou liked dinosaurs back then.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttBack then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

tGrant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway,
timpressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the many
titems we see another smoke canister, some battery-powered
tlanterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living on
tchocolate for weeks.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttWhen InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
ttstuff behind.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttAny weapons, radios?

tEric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttFound this, but the battery's dead.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttIt's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I 
ttbarely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight

tThe line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of true

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttt(trying to be positive)
ttThe important thing is we both made it.
ttThat's something we have in common.

tEric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes he
tshould offer one to his guest as well.

tGrant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...

tmoving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of a
tspinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus,
texcept for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it.

tGrant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly
tstill as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of the

tGrant immediately covers the boyx92s mouth. But it's to late.
tThe dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know how

tOnce the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's

tWhen he reaches the canyon wall, Paul turns a corner and runs
talong another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon.

tGrant and Amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to
tcatch up with Paul.

ttI'm trying! That thing took him down this

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttSplit up!

<b>tTHE PTERANODON
</b>
tcarries Eric deeper into the canyon. The creature's wings beat
tsteadily overhead, and the WIND is fierce. Eric looks down and
tsees the river far below.

tThe Pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at
tthe end of the canyon and drops Eric into --


<b>75CtEXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAYttttt75C
</b>
tA large bowl of mud and branches the size of a satellite dish.
tEric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked
tclean. Mixed among is one human skull.

tBefore Eric has time to cry out, he looks up to find

<b>tSIX PTERANODON HATCHLINGS
</b>
tclosing in on him with sharp-edged beaks.

tHe picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings.
tThey easily duck it and keep coming.

</b><b>ttNO!
</b>
<b>ttttBILLY
</b><b>ttI KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
</b>
tBilly jumps off the railing and

</b>
tGrant, Paul and Amanda watch as Billy FALLS past them like a
tstone, plummeting towards certain death. But then --

<b>tTHE PARASAIL CHUTE
</b>
tblossoms above him.

tNot only does it slows Billy's descent, but he even manages to
tcatch an updraft and begin to rise.

tHe struggles to control the parasail, swooping dangerously
tclose to the canyon wall, barely avoiding it.

tUp ahead he catches sight of Eric and steers towards him.

</b>
tHe circles around to make another attempt.

tPaul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of Eric in the

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttHang on, Eric!

tPaul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here. It's a
tbig leap, though, he might not make it. He steels himself up for
tthe jump, then chickens out.

tGrant and Amanda come up behind him. Suddenly,

<b>tA SECOND PTERANODON
</b>
tCRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next
tto a gaping hole in the mesh. The catwalk GROANS with the
textra weight.

tThe pteranodon JAMS its head through the hole, SNAPPING at
tthem.


<b>83tEXT. CANYON - IN THE AIR - DAYttttt83

tBilly circles, making his approach.

tIn the nest, Eric kicks at the hatchlings, but they're
tundeterred. Billy and Eric will only have one chance.

tAs Billy swoops past, Eric jumps and grabs onto his boot. He is
tyanked up and out of the nest. But than, MOTHER PTERANODON
tshoots past, tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak.

tSNAP through the hole in the enclosure.

tFinally the reptile's massive weight proves to much, and the
tentire section of the catwalk BREAKS FREE of the canyon wall
tand FLIPS OVER LATERALLY.

tAmanda, Grant and Paul are able to hang on, but so is the
tpteranodon, who now climbs their way.

tHis parasail badly damaged, Billy tries to keep aloft. Heading

</b>ttLet go!

tTerrified, Eric falls into the river safely. He surfaces,
timmediately swimming to shore.

tTrying to gain altitude, Billy bends hard to the right. But the
trigging is too badly damaged. He flies right into the canyon
twall, hitting hard.

tInstead of tumbling down to the river, he finds himself
tswinging from his harness - the parasail snagged on a rock
tspire above him.

tSuddenly. the far end of this inverted section of catwalk
tdetaches from the canyon wall and

tThe force of the action sends the three tumbling directly
ttowards the pteranodon.

tMiraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak. But they
tare all sent plummeting toward the river below.

tAmanda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them to
tkeep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river.

tWading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching for
tBilly. It doesn't take long to spot him.

tBilly continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail.

tThe doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall
tlike a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodons

teverything else.

tA MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks him
tstraight in the eye.

tThe gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as best
the can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucial

tBilly bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. He
twaves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shore

tGrant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him.

tGrant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickly
tfades as he sees

tJust then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. It
tstrikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head.
tBilly stumbles and falls to the ground.

tGrant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda takes

tGrant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains the

tAnd now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficult
tas it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it.

tJust as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Alan
tand Paul dive back into the river...

t...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPING

tCRASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually ripping
tit in one place.

tAt the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty,
twaterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying a
ttarp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dinos
tup and down the river.

tAmanda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul climb

ttthose who want to be astronauts.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttI want to be an astronaut.

</b>ttSee, I was the opposite. I never understood
ttwhy anyone would want to go into space. It's

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttExactly. The difference between imagining
tthow things might be and seeing how they

ttwhat Billy wanted to do.

tThe barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eric
tare the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS,
tunprepared. We don't know yet what they see.

ttttGRANT (cont'd)
ttI can blame the people who made this island.
ttBut I can't blame the people who want to see

tAt the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe-
tstruck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take a
tlook. And so do we.

<b>tUP AHEAD
</b>
tThe setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with
tdinosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbed
ttails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic,

tWith the mist from the river and the play of light, we're

tPaul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, and
tcautions must be taken to avoid the banks.

tAs the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH-
tPITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable,
tit is the RINGING SAT-PHONE.

tAll exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to
tleap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.

tTheir eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying
tthan anything they've yet seen.

tSEVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless flat
tground just beyond the river bank.

tAs our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them
talmost simultaneously.

</b>ttI've got something. I think I've got

tAll turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, he
tholds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS.

tReturning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with
ttheir arms. Finally:

tThe Kirbyx92s hear the recorded voice and let out a collective,
theavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone.

tIn all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned
tCARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, ready
tto eat them.

tBut as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won't
teat something that is covered in shit. After a beat, the

tin the dinosaur cage.

tThe fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of

tthem inside.

tIn the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars.
tDebris and equipment float around them.

tPaul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosaurus
tpushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, it
thas to be him.

tAnd so he dives.

tPushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy
tstructure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out.
tPaul himself isn't so lucky.

tSpinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight up

tshore.

<b>ttttGRANT

ttUp! Up!

tHe points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages
toff the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on
tcommand, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding
tlike a jungle gym.

tAll the while, they're trying to spot Paul.

tGrant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as
tSpinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of
tthe crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into
tthe water.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttWhere's Dad?

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttJust hold on.

tTry as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it
tRAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but
tAmanda catches him.

tAbout to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last
thope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he
tdecides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.

tHe blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On
tthe third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard
tthe raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.

tSpinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be
tcoming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.

tWe can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane
twill tip.

tBut not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant
tstops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.

tHe keeps blowing.

tThe crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears
tfrom the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply
tbats away.

tBut then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are
tdozens gathering, circling.

tGrant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with
thorrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter
twhich side wins.

tLooking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly
tthe raptors attack.

tSpinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they
tjust keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with
ttheir razor-sharp claws.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttJump! Swim for the far shore!

tAll three drop from the crane arm into the water.

tMeanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking
toff many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their
thooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.

tSpinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally
tcollapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.
tThen one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
tswimming away.

tBut a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to

</b>ttOkay. He loves us very very much. And I know
ttthat right now more than anything, your Dad
ttwould want to know that we're safe. Okay?

tEric nods.

<b>ttttAMANDA (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe're going to get out of this, and
tteverything's going to be all right, I promise.

<b>ttttA VOICE
</b>ttListen to your mother.

tOut of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked over
twith surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttGood thing I've been swimming, huh?

tAmanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.


<b>tttttttttCROSSFADE TO:
</b>

<b>108-109tOMITtttttttt108-109
</b>

<b>110tEXT. BEACH - DAYttttttt110
</b>
tThe foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing
teach direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they
tdon't seem to notice.

tTrying to keep his boy's spirit up...

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttYou remember when we went fishing last
ttsummer? And I was trying to put the boat in
ttand the trailer sank? And then the tow truck
ttcame and tried to pull it out, but it got
ttdragged in? And the truck driver threatened
ttto knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I
ttwas the governor and he believed me?

tEric really smiles, remembering the day.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttYeah.

tAmanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the
tincident.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttThat was a fun day.

tTo Paul, after some consideration....

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttWe should try fishing again.

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttYou mean it?

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttI do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?
ttThings might turn out differently.

tHer hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips
ttouching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.

tSensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down
tthe beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks
tconspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttThe lady you called, how do you know she can
tthelp us?

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttShe's the one person I could always count on.
ttAnd she's saved me more times than she
ttrealizes. I owe her everything.

tA long beat as they walk.

<b>ttttGRANT (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt's strikes me now I never told her that.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttYou should.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttYou're right.

tAs they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed against
tthe rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the
timpact.

tAnd it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar
tboat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasnx92t seen it yet, so
tGrant stops him.

<b>ttttGRANT (CONT'D)
</b>ttEric, do you know what happened to the boat?
ttthat brought you here? Why did it crash?

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttNo. I couldn't see.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttDo me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
ttminute, would you?
ttt(pre-empting objections)
ttThey look worried.

tEric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on,
tapproaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll
tfind, but he needs to look.

tAlmost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the
tocean, where he sees

<b>tTWO LIGHTS.
</b>
tHe doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure
tthey're real. They are. And they're coming closer.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttt(excited)
ttMom! Dad!

tThey look up to see the distant lights, just now making out
tfull forms...

<b>ttttPAUL
</b>ttHelicopters. Helicopters!

tHe SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,
tmaking as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- big
tmilitary choppers -- change direction, heading straight for
tthem.

tPaul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best
tof them

<b>tAT THE SPEEDBOAT
</b>
tGrant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. But
tthe cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are
tthree gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their
tspacing with his fingers.

<b>ttttERIC
</b>ttt(yelling over)
ttDr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

tGrant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of
tthree-toed tracks.

<b>ttttERIC (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe're safe!

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttt(to himself)
ttNo we're not.

<b>tTHE FIRST CHOPPER.
</b>
tflies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until the
tsecond helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to 
tcover them.

tGrant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. But
tthe noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.

<b>ttttGRANT (CONT'D)
</b><b>ttNO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!
</b>
tAt the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it
tlooks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but
tsomething more is happening.
<b>t
</b><b>tA PTERANODON
</b>
tflies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeous
tand terrifying sight.


<b>110AtINT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWNttttt110A
</b>
tTerrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the
tpteranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows,
tgrabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly.

tOne over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, getting
tdecapitated by the blade.


<b>110BtEXT. BEACH - DAWNttttttt110B
</b>
tAs the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amanda
tand Paul load in. Grant is running their way.


<b>110CtEXT. BY THE TREES - DAWNtttttt110C
</b>
tMeanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as it
tclimbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING
tinto the trees with a massive fireball.


<b>110DtINT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWNttttt110D
</b>
tSeeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric,
tAmanda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up.
tThe helicopter passes right over him.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttt(to the pilot)
ttYou have to go back! We can't leave him!

tSeeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord-
tand-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.


<b>110EtEXT. THE BEACH - DAWNttttt   110E
</b>
tGrant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the
twater. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of
tthe first chopper and starting to go after the second.

tBuffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the
tchopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to
tbite. It catches Grant's shoulder.

tGrant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes
tto bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
tAs it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

tThe entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the
tcreaturex92s wings.


<b>110FtINT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWNttttt110F
</b>
tUp with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed
tback to the island, unable to keep up.

<b>ttttAMANDA
</b>ttThey're not following.

tIn back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to
tretract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the
tpteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.

tAs Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.
tThe pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer
tand closer.

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttt(shouting over the noise)
ttWe have to cut it! Find something sharp!

tEveryone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.

tFinally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.

tGrant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but
tthe pteranodon keeps coming closer.

tPaul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight
tin the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a
tlittle.

tGrant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when
tthe pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's
tnowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.

tAnd idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,
tpulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites
tthrough the line.


<b>110GtEXT. OCEAN - DAWNttttttt110G
</b>
tThe pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching wind
tjust before it hits the water.

tIt circles and flies back to Isla Sorna.

tAs horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenly
tbeautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a small
tsymphony.

tSitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island in
tthe distance.

</b>ttWhat do you think is going to happen with the
ttdinosaurs?

<b>ttttGRANT
</b>ttThe population will Stabilize eventually.
ttThey'll adapt to fit different roles.
