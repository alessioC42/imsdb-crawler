ttBy

ttCarole Eastman

<b>ttTITLE SEQUENCE:
</b><b>tt
</b>ttThe Bach-Vivaldi A-Minor Concerto for Four Pianos
ttPLAYS OVER a series of family album photographs.
ttWritten in careful penmanship beneath each are
ttnames identifying family members:
<b>tt
</b>tt1ST PHOTO: A man stands in front of the raised
ttsounding board of a piano, playing the viola.
ttSeated on the piano bench, accompanying him, is a
ttwoman in a maternity dress: 
<b>tt
</b>tt"Isabelle and Nicholas"
<b>tt
</b>tt2ND PHOTO: A boy of 11, wearing conductor's tails
ttand holding a raised baton in his right hand as if

ttact of playing the violin:
<b>tt
</b>tt"Carl Fidelio Dupea"
<b>tt
</b>tt4TH PHOTO: The two boys are now poised behind the
ttpiano. Seated on its bench is a girl of 6, her
tthands resting on the keyboard. Written beneath:
<b>tt
</b>tt"Elizabeth Partita Dupea"
<b>tt
</b>tt5TH PHOTO: The above family group, seated on the
ttporch of the Dupea home. All eyes but Isabelle's
ttare faced toward the camera. She beams upon a 3
ttyear-old asleep in her arms, his head resting
ttagainst her bosom. His figure is encircled by the
ttpen's marking and preceding his name is the
ttconfiguration of a small heart:
<b>tt
</b>tt"Robert Eroica Dupea"
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. MUSIC ROOM - DUPEA HOME - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttBACH-VIVALDI OVER: 
</b><b>tt
</b>ttA 7-year-old BOBBY sits in a chair, his feet
ttdangling in absent-minded rhythm to a chamber piece
ttplayed by his father, his two brothers and his
ttsister. 
<b>tt
</b>ttCLOSE ON a metronome, marking a slow etude rhythm. 
<b>tt
</b>ttThe CAMERA MOVES from it to Bobby, on the piano
ttbench beside his mother. As she patiently
ttdemonstrates the etude for him, he places a thumb
ttin his mouth and leans against her arm. 
<b>tt
</b>ttON THE METRONOME at an andante rhythm. CARL and
ttTITA, now in their teens, are seated side by side
tton the piano bench, playing four-hands with
ttdazzling virtuosity. 
<b>tt
</b>ttThe CAMERA MOVES from them to a framed newspaper
ttarticle on the music-room wall. Below a photograph
ttof a 20-year-old young man are the words: "Herbert
ttKreutzer Dupea - Seattle's Youngest Guest
ttConductor."
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. RECITAL HALL GREEN ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttBACH-VIVALDI OVER:
</b><b>tt
</b>ttBobby, at 10, wearing a dress suit. His mother
ttcombs his hair with maternal concentration.
<b>tt
</b>ttCLOSE-UP of a program announcing a Dupea family
ttrecital. The CAMERA SCANS down the bill, over:
<b>tt
</b>ttSonata in C Major for Two Violins - Bach - Played
ttby Nicholas and Carl Dupea. 
<b>tt
</b>ttLike As a Lovelorn Turtle - Hendel - Sung by
ttIsabelle Dupea.

ttof a line of people moving slowly down the chapel
ttaisle. 
<b>tt
</b><b>ttANOTHER ANGLE 
</b><b>tt
</b>ttshows a solemn procession of the above, filing by
ttan open casket holding Isabelle Dupea.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttON THE FAMILY PEW
</b><b>tt
</b>ttThe CAMERA PANS from NICHOLAS, seated on the aisle,
ttto the four adult children seated next to him and
ttCOMES TO REST on Bobby. His gaze is cast down to
tthis lap, as he refuses to look at:
<b>tt
</b>ttThe pale profile of his mother's face resting
ttwithin the satin folds of the casket lining, and...
<b>tt
</b>tt... as the last of the "family friends" pay their
ttrespect: Nicholas steps out into the aisle and,
ttfollowed by Tita, Carl and HERBERT, moves down
tttoward the casket.  
<b>tt
</b>ttBobby rises from his seat and makes his way toward
ttthe aisle, where he hesitates briefly, then turns
ttand walks up the aisle and out the chapel doors. 
<b>tt
</b><b>ttTITLES END
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttEXT. SIGNAL HILL OIL FIELD - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttTAMMY WYNETTE'S "STAND BY YOUR MAN" OVER:
</b><b>tt
</b>ttThe toothed bucket of a back hoe trenches into the
ttearth, then lifts up into the air, revealing Bobby
ttin hard-hat and heavy gloves, operating the levers.
ttAs the hoe swings off to the side and deposits a
ttload of earth into the rear of a truck...
<b>tt
</b>tt... a SERIES OF SHOTS begins, showing Bobby and a
ttfellow hard-hat (ELTON) engaged in the dirty and
ttdangerous task of working "crew" with a team of
ttTOOL-PUSHERS on the derricks of Signal Hill.
ttFunctioning as servants of the well and its pumps,
ttthe PULL rods, MAKE and BREAK joints on the rig
ttfloor, WELD tubing, CARRY pipes, CLIMB the "tour,"
ttand PLAY THE DOZENS on beer wagon breaks. 
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. BOBBY'S CAR - SIGNAL HILL - NIGHT
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttABOVE SONG OVER:
</b><b>tt
</b>ttBobby, still in his hard hat, as he drives. Out
ttthrough the window, the derricks of the Hill can be
ttseen, their night-work lights on. 
<b>tt
</b><b>ttEXT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttSONG OVER:
</b><b>tt
</b>ttFOLLOWING ON the car as it moves off the Hill into
ttthe seamy districts adjacent to it, passing by fast
ttfood joints, liquor stores, all-night porno parlors
ttand neon-lighted bars. 
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttSONG OVER:
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttON BOBBY'S FACE:
</b><b>tt
</b>ttas he stares out through the windshield, his eyes
ttdistant, dwelling in an oblivion that blanks both
ttthe present and past. 
<b>tt
</b><b>ttEXT. BOBBY'S CAR - NIGHT
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttSONG OVER:
</b><b>tt
</b>ttThe car pulls onto a low-rent residential street
ttand comes to a stop in front of a small bungalow.
<b>tt
</b>ttBobby exits the car, moves up the walkway to the
tthouse and disappears inside. 
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. RAYETTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttSONG OVER:
</b><b>tt
</b>ttBobby, seated on the couch, a can of beer in hand,
ttstaring morosely across the room, to:
<b>tt
</b><b>ttA PORTABLE STEREO,
</b><b>tt
</b>ttplaying the song:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttWYNETTE (V.O.)
</b>ttt"And if you love him/Oh be proud of
ttthim/For after all, he's just a
tttman..."
<b>tt
</b><b>ttRAYETTE DIPESTO,
</b><b>tt
</b>ttin a waitress's uniform with a bowl of beer nuts.
ttAfter placing them on the coffee table in front of
tthim, she leans down and kisses him. Challenged by a
ttless than reciprocal response, she kisses him more
ttfervently. As she moves her lips from his ear to
tthis neck, he lifts the can to his mouth and drinks.  
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttWYNETTE (V.O.)
</b>ttt"Stand by your man/And show the
tttworld you love him/Keep giving all
tttthe love you can/Stand by your
tttman."
<b>tt
</b>ttThe song concludes, and setting aside her ardor for
ttthe moment:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttt(Arky accent)
tttI'm gonna play it again...
<b>tt
</b>ttAs she starts for the stereo, he takes hold of her
tthand. 
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYou're not going to play it again.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttWell, lemme play the other side
tttthen.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNo.
<b>tt
</b>ttAgain, he prevents her from moving to the stereo
ttand pulls her down onto the couch.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttNow quit, Bobby. You said you're
tttgoin' a help me pick a song. 
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYou said.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttWell, lemme sing the one I picked
tttan' see what you think...
tttt(she sings)
ttt"When there's a fire in your
tttheart/Break the glass/Sound the
tttalarm..."
<b>tt
</b>ttHe picks up one of the couch pillows and holds it
ttover his ear. 
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttOh, you prick...
<b>tt
</b>ttShe pulls it from his hand.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttHow 'bout if I just cut off your
tttdamn water?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI'm too moved by your gentility to
tttspeak. 
<b>tt
</b>ttShe immediately softens and tries to become more
tt"refined."
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttSugar, you know how I feel about
tttyou, don't you? I'm just tryin' to
tttget you to take an interest in my
tttkind a things, an' what I'm tryin'
tttto do with myself...
tttt(bringing her face close
ttttto his)
tttYou know, there id'n anything in
tttthe world I wouldn't do for you,
tttbaby. I started livin' the day I
tttfound you, you know that?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYou're playing the other side.
<b>tt
</b>ttVery hurt, she sits up and looks away from him. He
ttfinishes the beer and holds the can out to her. 
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttCerveza.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttt(grabbing it from him)
tttServeza yourself!
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNow, now.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttt(she stands up)
tttNo, dammit, I would easy.
<b>tt
</b>ttAnd, as she turns and goes toward the kitchen:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttBut you heal fast.
<b>tt
</b>ttThrough the open door to the kitchen, Rayette can
ttbe seen opening the refrigerator. She takes out a
ttcan of beer and returns to Bobby. 
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttt(over the above)
tttYou can play the piano, an' your
tttwhole damn family can play on some
ttttype a musical instrument. An' all
tttI'm askin' is for you to listen to
tttmy singing for one single little
tttsecond...
<b>tt
</b>ttShe hands him the can and sits back down on the
ttcouch.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttBut you think you would? No, you're
ttttoo damn selfish...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe gestures at the name tag on her dress, and, as
ttwe'll find he often does, speaks in the Okie-Arky
ttaccent he's learned from working the rigs:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWhy'nt you take 'at sign off your
ttttit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttOut where?
<b>tt
</b>ttShe sits down and begins removing the tag.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI don't know, I'll holler up Elton
tttan' Stoney...
<b>tt
</b>ttShe thinks about it, then moves closer to him and
ttbegins unbuttoning his workshirt, as:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttI'll go out with you, or I'll stay
ttthere, and do anything you'd like
tttfor me to do... if you'll just do
tttone thing. If you'll tell me that
tttyou love me.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYou can sing the song.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttt(annoyed)
tttYou know what, you are never
tttsatisfied.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttThat's right, hand.
<b>tt
</b>ttThe response makes her deeply insecure and she
ttimmediately lays her body against his...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttOh, now, baby...
<b>tt
</b>tt... and initiates another round of kissing.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
</b><b>tt
</b>ttBobby lifts his ball from the return rack, moves to
ttthe lane and bowls a perfect strike. Making a self
ttcongratulatory gesture of triumph, he turns back
ttto:
<b>tt
</b>ttElton, seated at the scoring table. His wife,
ttSTONEY, is seated beside Rayette on the horseshoe
ttbanquette. As he addresses Rayette, we note that
ttElton's two front teeth are missing.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttELTON
</b>tttt(Okie accent)
tttYour ball, Ray.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttt(reluctant)
tttIs this suppose to be fun?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttGo on, get up there...
<b>tt
</b>ttShe rises and moves to the rack.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttt... and stay relaxed this time.
<b>tt
</b>ttPicking up ball, she moves to the head of the lane
ttand slings it down the alley, watching hopefully
ttas...
<b>tt
</b>tt... it rolls off to the right and takes only one
ttpin.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttON BOBBY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttas she moves to her second ball.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNow don't loft it, just release it
tttlike I told you.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttON RAYETTE
</b><b>tt
</b>ttas she bowls the ball down the right-hand rut and
ttcomes back to the banquette, apologizing:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttThe ball's too heavy for me,
ttthoney...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe looks past her to Stoney, about to bowl her
ttball.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttIt's not the damn ball.
<b>tt
</b>ttAnd as Stoney bowls a strike, Rayette hugs his arm.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttI'm tryin', baby, so don't start
tttgettin' mad now.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNo, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll
tttbe all right. Just spot and follow
tttthrough...
<b>tt
</b>ttAnd as Elton bowls a strike...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>tttt(mumbling)
tttShit.
<b>tt
</b>ttHe gets up and passes Elton on his way to the rack.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>tttNice ball, El.
<b>tt
</b>ttRayette, to Stoney as she watches Bobby prepare to
ttbowl:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttId'n he somethin' to see?
<b>tt
</b>ttAnd as he makes another strike and returns to the
ttbanquette, she gets up and throws her arms around
tthim. He returns her embrace, smiling over her
ttshoulder at:
<b>tt
</b>ttTwo heavily made-up young women (TWINKY and BETTY)
tttaking possession of the adjacent lane. (Note that
ttBetty is of diminutive proportions, while Twinky is
ttAmazonian.)
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE (CONT'D)
</b>tttIs it my turn again?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttRight. Now show me a little
tttsomethin' this time, okay? Give me
tttsome form...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe remains standing, watching as she throws another
ttgutter ball and then comes back toward him, alibi
tting:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttI can't help it, honey, the ball
tttjust keeps goin' cocky wobbly on
tttme...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWill you just do what the hell I
ttttell you...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttI did, didn' I, El?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYou got another ball comin'.
<b>tt
</b>ttShe moves to the rack and, concentrating hard,
ttadvances down the lane and releases the ball. It
ttrolls slowly down the center, hits at precisely the
ttright spot and clears the pins.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttELTON
</b>tttAtta boy, Ray!
<b>tt
</b>ttEcstatic, she comes back to the banquette, seating
ttherself beside Bobby and trying to solicit a
ttresponse from him.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttThat was damn good, wad'n it? I
tttfinally did it...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYeah, great.
tttt(begins removing his
ttttbowling shoes)
tttWhy don't you throw Z's for 19
tttframes, and then roll a strike on
tttthe last ball in the last frame of
ttta losing game? Just wonderful.
<b>tt
</b>ttTurning to address the two young women over the
ttback of the banquette.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>tttWasn't it, ladies?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTWINKY
</b>tttt(pointing at herself)
tttAre you talking to us?
<b>tt
</b>ttRayette pulls off her rental shoes and throws them
ttto the floor.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttI'm gonna go wait in the car.
<b>tt
</b>ttHe stretches his arms out on the back of the
ttbanquette as though he intends to reside there
ttawhile.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYeah, why don't you do that.
<b>tt
</b>ttShe grabs her sling-back and her purse and as she
ttgets up:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttSTONEY
</b>tttWait an I'll I go with you,
ttthoney...
<b>tt
</b>ttAs she picks up her belongings and follows Rayette:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttELTON
</b>tttt(changing his shoes)
tttWe gotta get on home an' relieve
tttthe sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come
ttton over.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttOkay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for
tttthe beers...
tttt(hands him the bowling
ttttshoes)
tttAn' walk Rayette over with you,
tttwill you.
<b>tt
</b>ttElton moves off and Bobby, now full of remorse,
ttslumps into a depressed reverie. Beyond him, Betty
ttand Twinky, can be seen, engaged in some discussion
ttconcerning him.
<b>tt
</b>ttA WAITRESS with a tray approaches and leans down to
tthim.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttWAITRESS
</b>tttCan I get you anything else?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNo. How much do I owe you?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttWAITRESS
</b>tttFive'll do it.
<b>tt
</b>ttHe takes some loose bills from his pocket and lays
ttthem on her tray. She thanks him and moves off. As
tthe reaches down and pulls on one of his boots,
ttTwinky approaches behind him and leans down over
ttthe back of the banquette.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTWINKY
</b>tttWe been wantin' to ask you
tttsomething. Are you the guy on YV?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttAm I on TV?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTWINKY
</b>tttt(pointing lo Betty)
tttShe says you're the one that sells
tttall the cars on TV.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWell, I don't claim to have sold
ttt'em all. They still have some left,
tttI believe.
<b>tt
</b>ttBetty appears on the other side of the banquette.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttSee, I told you it was him...
tttt(then to Bobby)
tttYour name's Donnie something,
tttright?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI leave it to you.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttMy name is Shirley, but they call
tttme Betty, and her name's Twinky.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttt(looking to Twinky)
tttTwinky?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttt(explaining)
tttYeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttt(looking from one to the
ttttother)
tttWell, Betty and Twinky, it sure is
tttnice talking to you girls. I just
tttwish I had more time...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttThat's a wig you wear, isn't it?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttt(touching his hair)
tttA wig?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttYeah, I told her it was you, but
tttthat you're wearing a wig, 'cause
ttton TV you're mostly bald in the
tttfront.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttt(to Twinky)
tttYour little friend's real sharp
tttthere...
tttt(to Betty)
tttYeah, I don't like to wear the wig
ttton TV, because with two and a half
tttmillion people watching you, you've
tttgotta be sincere. I just like to
tttwear it when I'm out slippin'
tttaround bowling alleys an' things
tttlike that. I think it gives me a
tttlittle more class, don't you?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTWINKY
</b>tttOh, definitely...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttt(looking at his hairline)
tttYeah, but I can see a little bitty
tttof the net up there, that's what
tttgive it away.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTWINKY
</b>tttIt's so weird to see you in person,
tttbut that's who she says you are.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBETTY
</b>tttt(to her)
tttIt is him, he said it's him.
tttt(to Bobby)
tttAren't you.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYeah, you could say it's me.
<b>tt
</b>ttTwinky reaches over to the scoring table, picking
ttup a pencil and a score sheet.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTWINKY
</b>tttI'm gonna give you our number,
tttDonnie, just in case...
tttt(as she writes)
tttWe're both professionals, if you
tttdidn't guess.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWell, you seem very professional...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTWINKY
</b>tttt(handing the score sheet
ttttto him)
tttI always tell everyone the same
tttthing. I got rolled and beat up
tttreal bad recently, and since then
tttit's two for one, an' I work
tttstrictly in tandem with Betty...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe glances at the dwarfish Betty.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYeah, I can see how she'd come in
ttthandy.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttEXT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b><b>tt
</b>ttRayette sits sulking in Bobby's car. He comes up to
ttthe passenger window and leans down to her.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttCome on. We're goin' over to
tttElton's.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttI'm not.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYou just going to sit there?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttYes.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttOkay. Hope no one hits on you.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttI hope they do.
<b>tt
</b>ttHe casually slaps the outside of the door.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttSee you later, then...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe walks off through the lot.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttON RAYETTE
</b><b>tt
</b>ttstaring out through the windshield.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttON BOBBY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttas he stops and comes back to the car.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNo one would want to hit on you,
tttyou look too pathetic.
<b>tt
</b>ttNo response.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>tttCome on, DiPesto. We can still have
ttta good time.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttYou're the pathetic one, not me.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI'm going on over there...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttI'm not some piece a crap.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI know you're not.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttYou treat me like I was.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI'm sorry.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttt(close to tears)
tttYou go slippin' around in front a
tttmy face, an' in front a Elton an'
tttStoney. What do you imagine they
tttthink a someone you treat that
tttway...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNow, hand...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe opens the door and gets inside, putting his arm
ttaround her.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>tttElton and Stoney know how I feel
tttabout you. An' they're just goin'
tttto think I'm not too nice a guy,
tttwhich I'm not, an' that you're a
ttthell of a person puttin' up with
tttme, that's all.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttRAYETTE
</b>tttYou're goin' a find me dead one
ttttime.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttSssh, come on now...
tttt(he kisses her)
tttBe a good girl.

ttseated at the other.

</b>ttHis eyes are half-closed and are cast down to the

tttprivate detective to ferret you
tttout, and I said, "What for?"
tttWhatever the hell he's doing, even

ttclosed mouth.

</b>tttt(to Catherine)
tttHow long have you been staying
ttthere?

</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttA couple of months.

tttRobert?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWhat?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttIt's still nearly impossible for me
tttto turn my neck. If I wanted to

tttthe whole base of my body around...
tttt(demonstrating)
ttt... like this...

</b>ttTita gets up from the table and, taking her plate,
ttexits to the kitchen. And as Carl readjusts himself
ttin his chair and takes a sip from his wine glass,
ttBobby looks at Catherine to find her looking at

</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttActually, it's very admirable, the

</b>ttShe moves toward the front door, with Bobby
ttfollowing.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWhat're you doing right now...
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. DUPEA HOME - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttCatherine comes inside and moves toward the
ttstairway, with Bobby behind.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttRight now I'm going to run a hot
ttttub and soak myself.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttThen after that?
<b>tt
</b>ttShe goes up a few steps and turns back to him.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttAfter that, I plan to read some
tttmusic and rest for awhile.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttTomorrow, then.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttTomorrow's a full practice day...
tttt(continues up the stairs)
tttBut the day after is kind of open.
<b>tt
</b>ttAt the top of the stairs, she stops and looks down
ttat him.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>tttCarl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttt(as if it were a year)
tttThe day after tomorrow.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttIf you're free.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYeah, I'll probably be free.
<b>tt
</b>ttShe turns and disappears into the second-floor
tthallway.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. DUPEA KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b><b>tt
</b>ttDinner has concluded and Tita moves around the
tttable, distributing cups and saucers. Carl is
ttremote and off his feed. Spicer attends Nicholas,
ttand Catherine looks across the table to Bobby as he
ttdrinks from a bottle of beer.
ttAfter a moment, a loud belch comes from Nicholas
ttand Tita quickly requests:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttDon't laugh...
<b>tt
</b>ttShe attempts to stifle her own amusement, as do
ttBobby and Catherine, then changes the subject:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA (CONT'D)
</b>tttWhat's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate
tttanything...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttI took some aspirin and it really
tttupset my stomach.
<b>tt
</b>ttCatherine begins pouring the coffee.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttOne thing that's hard to understand
tttis how you could have this
tttincredible background in music, and
tttthen just walk away from it,
tttwithout a second thought...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI gave it a second thought.
<b>tt
</b>ttTita seats herself at the table, addressing Spicer:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttHe looks tired to me, Spicer. I
tttthink you should put him to bed.
<b>tt
</b>ttHe nods, and as he gets up and wheels Nicholas from
ttthe room:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttI mean, how could you not play
tttanymore? That's so strange to me...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI have played a few times. Here and
tttthere. As a matter of fact, I was
tttonce a rehearsal pianist for a Las
tttVegas musical revue.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttYou don't call that music, though.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttOf course I do. It's music. You
tttknow...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe places his hands on the table and simulates the
ttplaying of a rousing production-type show-stopper,
ttsimultaneously vocalizing as he does.
<b>tt
</b>ttThough Tita and Catherine are amused, Carl winces
ttdisapprovingly and breaks into Bobby's act:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttRobert, do you mind?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWhat?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttNothing. Will you excuse us for a
tttwhile?
<b>tt
</b>ttHe takes hold of Catherine's hand and stands up.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttWe really don't have to, Carl, if
tttyou're not feeling good...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttt(a bit martyred)
tttWell, maybe if we put the
tttThermaphore on me for a while,
tttfirst...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttOh, all right.
<b>tt
</b>ttAnd as they move to the door, she glances
ttapologetically back at Bobby.
<b>tt
</b>ttDeflated and embarrassed, he looks away from Tita's
ttsympathetic gaze. After a brief silence, she
ttreaches to a platter on the table.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttDo you want some gingerbread?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttt(elsewhere)
tttWhat?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttWith applesauce?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNo, thanks...
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. DUPEA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>tt
</b>ttBobby stands in the living room. It is dark and the
ttonly light comes from some burning logs in the
ttfireplace. He listens briefly to the sounds of a
ttBeethoven sonata coming from the music room...
<b>tt
</b>tt... then moves to a chaise near the fireplace and
ttlies down, staring absently into the flames. After
tta moment, he closes his eyes.

<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. DUPEA LIVING ROOM - MORNING
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttON BOBBY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttstill asleep in the chaise. He is suddenly jolted
ttawake by a loud thud and sits up, looking out the
ttwindow to:
<b>tt
</b><b>ttPOV OF SPICER
</b><b>tt
</b>ttlifting a barbell with heavy weights attached to
ttit. He does a series of vigorous presses with it,
ttbefore he again lets the bar drop heavily onto the
ttporch.

</b><b>ttINT. DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b><b>tt(BACH VIOLIN OVER:)
</b><b>tt
</b>ttBobby stands in the hallway, a phone to his ear,
ttlistening to Rayette and looking down the hall
tttoward the open door to Catherine's room.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYeah, well fine, you know what I
tttsuggest, Ray...
tttt(listening)
tttBecause I don't know how long.
tttThings are not going that well
ttthere...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe listens again, his eyes on Catberine, moving
ttaround in her room.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>tttYeah, well I'm not having any fun,
ttteither, so why don't you...
tttt(pause)
tttNo, you can't, it's just not
tttconvenient, and I have to get
tttoff...
tttt(listening impatiently)
tttRay, I really have to go, I have to
tttget off now...
tttt(longer pause)
tttAnother couple of days, maybe. I'll
tttcall you and let you --
tttt(pause)
tttAll right, if you're gone, you're
tttgone. Now I have to get off, okay?
tttt(pause)
tttBye, Ray...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe hangs up and, as he starts down the hall to
ttCatherine's room, the VIOLIN STOPS and Carl steps
ttout into the hall ahead of him. He carries his
ttfiddle and detains Bobby, with:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttOnly 10 minutes of playing and it's
tttalready killing my neck...
<b>tt
</b>ttBobby looks past him to Catherine as she glances
ttout at them and then closes the door to her room.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttEXT. DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttBobby and Carl, playing a game of table tennis.
ttTita stands leaning against a tree, watching them.
ttIn the b.g., Spicer can be seen, meticulously
ttoiling and cleaning the wheelchair.
<b>tt
</b>ttAs they volley the ball back and forth:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYou sure you should be playing,
tttCarl?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttWhat do you mean? Aside from my
tttneck, I'm in superb shape.
<b>tt
</b>ttCarl hits into the net, and as the ball rebounds to
tthim, he tosses it to Bobby.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttt(serving)
tttI don't know, there's something
tttwrong with the way you move.
<b>tt
</b>ttCarl hits the net again.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttI'm not aware of it. Like what?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYour serve. Two -- Eighteen.
<b>tt
</b>ttCarl serves and as they volley:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>tttI'd hate to see you walk across a
tttconcert stage like that.
<b>tt
</b>ttCarl tries a smash and mis-hits the ball...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>tttTwo -- Nineteen.
<b>tt
</b>tt... and as he retrieves it:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttt(irritated with Bobby)
tttI've walked across a stage a number
tttof times, without exciting any
tttparticular response...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttThat's what I mean...
<b>tt
</b>ttCarl comes back to the table.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttAny particular humor, I meant.
<b>tt
</b>ttHe angrily serves the ball.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttt(returning)
tttI think you should get someone to
tttcoach you how to walk. I think it's
ttta substantial problem.
<b>tt
</b>ttHe hits a smash and it sails past Carl into some
ttshrubbery several yards away.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttDammit!
<b>tt
</b>ttAs he moves after the ball, Bobby gestures at him.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttLook at that.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttWhy are you being so mean?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI'm not. He does walk funny. Don't
tttyou see that?
<b>tt
</b>ttShe looks at Carl, bent over and searching through
ttthe shrubs.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttI don't think I'd notice. I'm so
tttused to Carl.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttt(wanting to go on about
ttttit)
tttYeah, well, he's...
<b>tt
</b>ttShe interrupts him, looking toward Spicer.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttBobby? Do you think Spicer is
tttattractive?
<b>tt
</b>ttHe looks over at Spicer, polishing the frame of the
ttwheelchair.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI think he's got a terrific
tttpersonality.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttYou know, he was formerly a sailor.
<b>tt
</b>ttBobby gestures his paddle at Carl, on his way back
ttwith the ball.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttLook, can't you see that, what I'm
ttttalking about?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttSailors are sadistic, I feel.
<b>tt
</b>ttCarl comes up to the table, asserting:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttSee? There's nothing wrong with the
tttway I walk. Now where are we?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttAt game, Carl.
<b>tt
</b>ttCarl serves and they volley briefly. Then BobbY
ttangles the ball sharply and puts it away.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>tttThat's three games to none, Carl.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttAll right, let's have a rematch.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI thought you had to go to the
tttmainland today. Aren't you going to
tttmiss the ferry?
<b>tt
</b>ttCarl takes a quick glance at his watch, then drops
tthis paddle onto the table.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttToo bad. Just when I was hitting my
tttstride.
<b>tt
</b>ttHe starts away, then turns back.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL (CONT'D)
</b>tttSay goodbye to Catherine for me,
tttwill you?
<b>tt
</b>ttAs he moves off in the direction of the cars, Tita
ttcomes up beside Bobby.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttCan I play now?
<b>tt
</b>ttCarl calls over to them from his car:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCARL
</b>tttTell her I'll be back sometime
ttttomorrow!
<b>tt
</b>ttBobby turns to Tita.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWhere is she, anyway?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttTITA
</b>tttt(ignoring the question)
tttMy turn.
<b>tt
</b>ttHe hands her the paddle...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWhy don't you and Spicer play?
<b>tt
</b>tt... and moves off toward the house.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttBobby knocks on Catherine's door and, hearing no
ttresponse, opens it and steps inside.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. CATHERINE'S ROOM - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttHe wanders about, discreetly touching nothing, but
tttaking in some essence of Catherine from her
ttbelongings and from the scent of her that lingers
ttin the room.
<b>tt
</b>ttHis journey brings him into proximity with the
ttwindows and he pauses to look out at:
<b>tt
</b><b>ttTITA AND SPICER BELOW
</b><b>tt
</b>ttplaying table tennis.
<b>tt
</b>ttHe starts to move from the windows, when he sees:
<b>tt
</b><b>ttCATHERINE'S CAR
</b><b>tt
</b>ttpulling into view and parking near the garage. She
ttgets out, and, carrying a shopping bag and a
ttwrapped bouquet of flowers, pauses on her way to
ttthe house to have some exchange with Tita.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. DUPEA HOME - STAIRCASE - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttON BOBBY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttquickly descending the staircase, and FOLLOWING
ttwith him as he moves to the music room and goes
ttinside, leaving the door open.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttHe crosses to one of the grands, seats himself and
ttrubs his hands together to warm them. Then,
ttscanning his mental repertoire, he places his hands
tton the keyboard and begins to play a Chopin etude.
<b>tt
</b>ttPresently, Catherine appears in the doorway. She
ttstands listening for a moment, then places the
ttshopping bag and flowers on a settee near the
ttdoorway and crosses to a chair near the pianos and
ttsits down.
<b>tt
</b>ttBobby glances at her, then returns his eyes to the
ttkeyboard.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttON CATHERINE
</b><b>tt
</b>tther features intensely concentrated, as she listens
ttto his playing.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttON BOBBY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttapparently deep into the music. On the wall behind
tthim are the series of photographs seen in the
ttopening and the present ANGLE FAVORS an 8-year-old
ttBobby in his dress suit, playing a recital.
<b>tt
</b>ttTHE CAMERA MOVES down to his hands...
<b>tt
</b>tt... then to Catherine, profoundly moved.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttANGLE INCLUDING BOTH
</b><b>tt
</b>ttas Bobby plays the concluding chords of the etude.
ttHe lets his hands linger on the keys until the last
ttovertones fade, then he removes them to his lap.
<b>tt
</b>ttAfter a brief silence:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttThat was beautiful, Robert. I'm
tttsurprised...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttThank you.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttI was really very moved by the way
tttyou...
<b>tt
</b>ttUnable to keep up the "serious" musician pose, a
ttbrief, derisive laugh issues from him.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>tttIs that funny?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttIt wasn't supposed to be, it just
tttstruck me that way.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttWhy?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNothing. It's just that... I picked
tttthe easiest piece I could remember.
tttI think I first played it when I
tttwas 8 years old and I played it
tttbetter then.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttIt doesn't matter. It was the
tttfeeling I was affected by.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttI didn't have any.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttYou had no inner feeling?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNone.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttThen I must have been supplying it.
<b>tt
</b>ttShe gets up and crosses toward the settee.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWait...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttWell, at least you're accomplished
tttat something...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttWhat?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttAt being a fake.
<b>tt
</b>ttAnd as she picks up the flowers and the shopping
ttbag:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttCatherine...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttNo, you're very good at it. I'm
tttreally impressed.
<b>tt
</b>ttShe goes out the door.
<b>tt
</b>ttBobby looks down at the keyboard. He closes the
ttcover and softly utters:
<b>tt

</b>tttShit.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttShe stands in front of a dresser mirror, pinning up
tther hair, preparatory to taking a bath. Her
ttattention is drawn to...
<b>tt

ttquickly turns back to the mirror.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYou think I'm a fake.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttI think it's what you think.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttNo, it isn't what I think.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttLook... You made a very calculated
tttmove, and then made me feel
tttembarrassed for responding to you.
tttThat wasn't necessary.
<b>tt
</b>ttShe moves away from him and he follows her.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttYes, it was. You've made it clear
tttthat if I can cut a little piano, I
tttmight get a little response.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttt(stops and turns to him)
tttI don't think that's accurate...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttUp to now, what I've been getting
tttfrom you are meaningful looks over
tttthe dinner table and a lot of vague
tttsuggestions about the day after
ttttomorrow...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttI'm not conscious of having given
tttyou any meaningful looks. And as
tttfor the day after tomorrow, this is
tttthe day after tomorrow, and I am,
tttunfortunately, seeing you... Now if
tttyou'll excuse me, I'd like to take
ttta bath.
<b>tt
</b>ttShe moves back to the dresser and as she begins
ttsearching through an array of bath oils on top of
ttit, Bobby steps in beside her.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttIt's convenient to fake looking for
tttsomething right now, isn't it?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttI'm not faking anything. I'm
tttlooking for some bath oil...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttSome bath oil?
<b>tt
</b>ttHe lifts up one of the bottles.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>tttWhat about this one?
tttt(picking up another)
tttOr this one?
tttt(and another)
tttHow about some jasmine?
tttt(and another)

<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttt(knocking the bottles

tttWhat are you doing, screwing around

<b>tt
</b>ttA little intimidated by his aggressivity:

</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttI don't find your language that
tttcharming.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttIt's direct, anyway, which seems to
tttbe difficult for you.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttI'd like you to leave now. Is that
tttdirect enough?
<b>tt
</b>ttHe makes no move to go.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE (CONT'D)
</b>tttYou're not a serious person, by
tttyour own admission. And that may be
tttinteresting, but it doesn't
tttinterest me...
<b>tt
</b>ttNeeding the safety of distance, she moves over to
ttthe windows next to the bed. Again, he follows
ttafter her.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttSerious, that's what's important to
tttyou?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttYes, that's what's important to
tttme...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe takes her by the shoulders...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttOkay, let's be serious...
<b>tt
</b>tt... and forces her onto the bed.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttNo, don't do that...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttShut up...
<b>tt
</b>ttHe hesitates for a moment, full of things he wants
ttto say and cannot. Catherine looks up at him,
ttuttering a quiet challenge:

</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttNo inner feeling.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttThat's right.
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttI don't believe vou.

</b>ttHe leans down to her, begins kissing her. Her arms
ttencircle him and laying back on the bed, she pulls
tthis body onto hers, fervently returning his kisses.
ttAnd as he responds with an ardor absent of fakery
ttand full of a lifetime of derelict feelings, a FADE
ttOVER BEGINS, to:
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. CATHERINE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttCatherine and Bobby lie side by side. He watches
tther as she addresses the ceiling:
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttI married him when I was 17. He was
ttta cellist, and I thought he was the
tttmost brilliant man I'd ever met...
tttAnd I'm sure he was, because at
tttthat age, I hadn't met that many...
tttBut he was insidious, you know. He
ttthad me convinced that I was a
tttmediocrity, musically, as a woman,
tttas an intellect. But in this
tttcompletely imperceptible, pleasant
tttway, so that you weren't even sure
ttthe was doing it. Anyway, I just
tttwoke up one morning and I said, you
tttknow something Joseph, you're full
tttof beans, and I left him...
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttThat's what you said?
<b>tt
</b><b>tttttCATHERINE
</b>tttSomething witty and devastating
tttlike that.
<b>tt
</b>ttShe moves onto her side, looking over at him.

tttHow are you?

</b>tttDo you think you could discreetly
tttmove across the hall now?

tttIt's not just because of Carl, or

tttHow can he ask for love in return?
tttI mean, why should he ask for it?

</b>tttAre you cold?

</b>tttTita suggested that we try to... I

<b>tt
</b><b>tttttBOBBY
</b>tttCut it out!

ttcrosses toward the men's room and disappears
ttinside, a Peterbilt semi can be seen pulling into
ttthe station.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttINT. GAS STATION - MEN'S ROOM - DAY
</b><b>tt
</b>ttBobby removes his jacket and lays it on top of the
ttwaste container. He moves to the wash basin and
ttstands a moment, gazing absently down at it, his
ttmind searching for that inward oblivion in which
ttnothing much is demanded, nothing much felt.
<b>tt
</b>ttThen, leaning over and placing his hands on the rim
ttof the basin...
<b>tt
</b>tt... he lifts his gaze to the mirror and, after
ttminutely perusing the features of his face, looks
ttinto his own eyes as he had into his fathers,
ttsilently beseeching them for guidance.

ttHe has left his jacket inside and stands for a
ttmoment, looking at the...

</b>tt... DRIVER, bending down to check the undercarriage
ttof the semi. As he stands up and circuits the front
ttof the truck, heading for the cab:
<b>tt

</b>tttt(faintly audible)
tttHey, wait a minute.

</b>ttHe moves over to him and after a brief exchange,

ttsurveys the area for some sign of Bobby, the semi
ttMOVES INTO VIEW, going north on the highway.

</b>ttRayette looks over the hood of the car, addressing
ttthe attendant. He gestures toward the men's room
ttand as she moves across the station and disappears
