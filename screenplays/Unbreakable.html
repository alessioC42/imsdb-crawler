<b>INT. CLOTHING STORE - AFTERNOON
</b>
Women's casual wear department. J.C. Penny.

Legend "1961"

An African-American man carrying two J.C. Penny shopping bags is ushered past the
department store managers and security guards on walkies that have gathered at
the entrance to the woman's dressing rooms.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
A bed has been formed by a chair and three benches.

A STRIKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in her twenties lays across it. Her face and
clothes are covered in sweat. Her skirt is stained.

She holds something wrapped in a soft sweatshirt on her chest. We can't see it,
but WE HEAR THE BABY CRYING.

She's just given birth.

There are three frazzled saleswomen in the dressing room with her. They watch her
with quiet smiles.

A fourth SALESWOMAN arrives ushering in the man with the shopping bags.

<b>tttt SALESWOMAN
</b>ttThis is Mr. Mathison. He's
tta doctor.

DR. MATHISON looks over the scene and then directly at the striking woman.

<b>tttt DR. MATHISON
</b>ttYou okay?

The woman nods, "Yes." Sweat trickles down her face. THE BABY'S PIERCING CRIES
<b>ECHO IN THE SMALL ROOM.
</b>
<b>tttt SALESWOMAN
</b>ttAn ambulance is on the way.

Dr. Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her. He kneels down and
gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms.

<b>tttt DR. MATHISON
</b>ttIs there a name yet?

Beat. The woman smiles for the first time.

<b>tttt WOMAN
</b>ttElijah.

She hands him the wrapped child. We can't see the baby, but THE PIERCING CRIES
<b>SEEM TO GET LOUDER.
</b>
<b>tttt WOMAN
</b>ttIs he supposed to be crying
ttlike that?

The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him.

The woman can't see her baby anymore. She watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down
and examines her child. Beat. Dr. Mathison doesn't look up for the longest time.

<b>tttt WOMAN
</b>ttCan I have him back?

THE BABY'S CRYING IS RELENTLESS. UNNERVING. Beat.

The doctor finally glances up. He looks shaken. He makes eye contact with the
woman for only a second. It's enough. A chill goes through her body.

He looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room.

<b>tttt DR. MATHISON
</b>ttWhat happened during the
ttdelivery?

His hard stare unsettles the women. The OLDER SALESWOMAN speaks up.

<b>tttt OLDER SALESWOMAN
</b>ttNothing. It was very quick.
ttThe baby just wanted to come
ttright out. There was no
ttproblems.

<b>tttt DR. MATHISON
</b>ttDid you drop him?

Everyone becomes very still. The mother looks like she stopped breathing. THE
<b>BABY'S SCREAMING ENGULFS THE ROOM.
</b>
<b>tttt DR. MATHISON
</b>ttDid you drop this baby?

Beat.

<b>tttt OLDER SALESWOMAN
</b>ttJesus Christ, no.

The BABY SCREAMS.

The doctor whispers something to himself, we can't hear. He looks up to the
saleswoman who brought him in.

<b>tttt DR. MATHISON
</b>ttPlease inform the ambulance
ttwe have a situation...

Dr. Mathison turns back to the mother. Beat.

<b>tttt DR. MATHISON

<b>EXT. TRAIN STATION NEW JERSEY - DAY
</b>
<b>LEGEND "PRESENT DAY"
</b>
A fountain of humanity bubbles up from the escalators to the train platform.

Businessmen take their last desperate drags of their cigarettes... Women
traveling with children herd their luggage and offspring into tight shapes as
they move... College students with backpacks look around dazed at the various
track numbers.

tttt ANNOUNCER(o.s.)
ttLast call track three,
ttAmtrak Clocker making it's
ttfinal stop at Philadelphia's
ttthirtieth street station.
ttFirst two passenger cars
ttonly. First two cars only.

A face inside the train watches the stream of passengers emerging from the
escalators. DAVID DUNNE, a man in his early forties, rest his temple against the
glass and quietly observes the movement outside.

The train starts to pull out.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. PASSENGER CAR - DAY
</b>
David sits with his coat on his lap. He's wearing a tie. He doesn't look very
comfortable in it.

He feels a stare. He looks up to find a girl, six or seven years old, peering at
him from over the seat in front of him. She just gazes at him blankly.

He gives her a small forced smile. She doesn't react. David returns his head to
the window.

His eyes begin to shut with the lulling movement of the train.

tttt WOMAN(o.s.)
ttYou alone?

David looks in the direction of THE VOICE. A WOMAN with dark hair and light blue
eyes stands in the aisle with two bags over her shoulder. She's wearing a tight
white t-shirt and jeans. She's beautiful.

David nods "yes."

The woman starts putting her bags on the shelf above the seats. She stretches to
get them up. Her toned stomach is exposed. She has a silver ring pierced through
her navel.

David has a gold ring on his hand. He fiddles with it. Beat. He gently slips off
his wedding band. It goes into his coat pocket.

The woman takes the seat next to him.

Beat. A LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. The passenger car shakes as a passing
train barrels by two feet from David's window. It passes in a few seconds. The
car returns to a QUIET HUM.

David pulls a magazine out from the seat pocket in front of him.

He holds the woman's fashion magazine out.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttSomeone left these. You want
ttone?

The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports
Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket.

David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttYou like sports?

<b>tttt WOMAN
</b>ttIt's my field. I represent
ttathletes. I'm an agent.

tttt WOMAN(smiling)
ttIs that right?

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttBut I'm afraid of water, so
ttthat's been holding my
ttcareer back a little bit.

The woman laughs.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttYou represent someone in
ttPhiladelphia?

<b>tttt WOMAN
</b>ttI'm meeting a player from
ttTemple University. He's a

<b>tttt WOMAN
</b>ttThis kid is six foot two,

Beat. David studies the excitement in her eyes.

ANOTHER LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. David waits till the opposing train passes.
The woman goes back to her magazine. Beat.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttI'm David Dunne.

The woman looks up.

<b>tttt WOMAN
</b>ttKelly.

She goes back to the magazine.

Beat.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttHow long are you staying in
ttPhilly?

KELLY looks up from her Sports Illustrated. Her striking blue eyes gaze at David.
Beat.

She holds up her hand. Taps the diamond ring on her finger.

tttt KELLY(soft)
ttI'm married.

tttt DAVID(fake excitement)
ttGreat.

Beat.

<b>tttt KELLY
</b>ttSorry.

tttt DAVID(fake confusion)
ttWhat are you talking about?

An awkward silence.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttI think you got the wrong
ttidea.

The woman stares at David. She looks down. Beat. Closes the magazine.

<b>tttt KELLY
</b>ttI'm going to find another
ttseat.

Kelly gets up. She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles. She
starts to the back of the car.

David sits alone. He looks like he's drowning, but there's no water.

He feels a stare. He glances up. The little girl spies on him from between the
seats.

David leans towards the window to avoid eye contact. His hand reaches into his
coat and slides out his wedding band. He puts it back on.

His temple touches the glass. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes
closed... Beat.

David's head bounces lightly against the window.

The shaking of the glass never allows David's eyes to completely close.

He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger.

He looks out the window. The scenery blurs as it flies by. Beat.

David turns. Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the
train is picking up speed.

The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified.

The WORRIED VOICES OF THE TRAVELERS START FILL THE CABIN.

The train goes faster.

<b>AND THEN THE HIGH PITCHED METAL ON METAL SCREECHING STARTS AS THE TRAIN BEGINS TO
</b><b>TAKE A CURVE.
</b>
David's eyes move to the seat in front of him. The little girl is no longer
watching him.

DAVID LOOKS TO THE PASSENGERS ACROSS FROM HIM. He sees the ground slowly drop
away in the windows behind them as THEIR SIDE OF THE TRAIN STARTS TO RISE...

<b>THE PASSENGERS SCREAM AS THE AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN BEGINS TO TILT OFF THE
</b><b>TRACK...
</b>
<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
A boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television
upside down. His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red
face. He changes channels with a remote control.

He moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows. He stops
on an upside down picture of a crashed train. Beat.

His knees come forward as he flips over. He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto
the carpet. JEREMY DUNNE gazes at the television screen... A LIVE AERIAL VIEW OF
A TRAIN WRECK SMOULDERING BELOW IS SEEN. Two trains are tangled like snakes.

Jeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone. Next to the phone is a
notepad. On it is written...

"Dad - Amtrak 177 - 3:40pm."

Jeremy looks at the television. At the bottom of the screen in red block letters
that move from right to left are words and numbers..."The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed... Amtrak Emergency number is 1-800-777-4322... The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has
derailed...Amtrak"

Jeremy doesn't take his eyes off the screen. He makes a small desperate noise
that no one hears.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
An elderly woman can't hold back any longer and SCREAMS. An embarrassed, tortured
helpless scream.

MEGAN DUNNE continues applying pressure to her arm which is being pushed back as
far as it will go.

She counts to three and eases off. She lays her arm back in her lap.

WE ARE IN A PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER. About a dozen people are on specialized
weight machines.

The elderly woman is seated on an exercise table and breathes slowly.

<b>tttt MEGAN
</b>ttYou okay, Virginia?

Beat. VIRGINIA shakes her head, "No."

<b>tttt MEGAN
</b>ttI'll put something on the
ttt.v. Maybe we'll find some
ttalmost naked guys to inspire
ttyou.

Megan reaches up to the t.v. monitor mounted on the wall. She turns it on and
starts flipping channels. She stops on ESPN where a swimming meet is underway.
Men in bikini swimsuits line the edges of the pool.

Virginia starts watching with great interest.

Megan's eyes move to the tiny print moving across the bottom of the screen. Her
face goes still as she reads the train number... 177.

<b>INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
<b>DAVID DUNNE'S EYES SLOWLY OPEN. THE DULL WHITE OF THE OVERHEAD TUBE LIGHTING
</b><b>BLINDS HIM AT FIRST.

He blinks his vision back. He realizes he's in a bed.

<b>WE HEAR AGITATED VOICES, MOVEMENT.
</b>
David looks around. He's in an emergency room. There are a half dozen prep areas
and beds next to him. They're all empty.

<b>DAVID FOLLOWS THE URGENT SOUNDS OF ACTIVITY TO A PREP AREA DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM
</b><b>HIM.
</b>
He can only see glimpses of activity through the drawn curtain. A group of
emergency room personnel are treating a man whose body is twitching violently on
a gurney.

One of the group is a man who glances through the opening in the curtain. He
notices David sitting up from across the room.

THE MAN IN SCRUBS leaves the group and walks over.

<b>tttt MAN IN SCRUBS

set of double doors.

A room crammed with cameras and photographers explodes with movement.

<b>A CHILD'S VOICE BREAKS THEIR NOISE.
</b>
<b>tttt JEREMY
</b>ttI told you!

Jeremy Dunne pushes forward through the mob of people and cameras. He bursts out
and runs to David. He wraps his arms around David's waist. David just stands
there, aware that the cameras are catching it all. He's overwhelmed.

Hospital staff and a couple police officers push the media back.

Jeremy tugs David to lean down. He does.

<b>tttt JEREMY
</b>ttThey thought everybody on
ttthe train died.

David looks at his son's face. Wipes the tears on his cheek.

<b>tttt JEREMY
</b>ttI told them they were wrong.

A woman moves to them. David stands up and faces Megan Dunne.

<b>tttt JEREMY
</b>ttMom even cried.

David looks at Megan's eyes.

<b>tttt JEREMY
</b>ttA lot.

Megan looks away.

<b>tttt MEGAN
</b>ttNot a lot.

They stand there for a moment. David looks shaken. Jeremy takes hold of his hand.

<b>tttt JEREMY
</b>ttLet's go home.

Megan nods. They move to the exit. The pack of cameras and reporters burst to
life as they leave the building. They jockey for position to get a last glimpse
of David Dunne.

David stops just before rising the stairs. He glances into a bedroom at the

up. He turns on the t.v., low volume, as he moves into the bathroom.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:

Hot water rushes over David's face as he stands in the shower. His attention is
drawn to the t.v. which is seen through the slightly open bathroom door.

He turns off the water to HEAR.

David steps out of the shower. He sees a glimpse of Jeremy asleep in bed. David
shuts the door. Locks it.

He gets back into the shower and turns the water back on.

He closes his eyes. His face tightens up. He slowly hunches down and takes a seat
on the tiled floor of the shower. Water pours over him. Beat.

His muscular body begins to shake. Then we realize he's crying.

<b>EXT. FAIR - DAY
</b>
<b>LEGEND "1969"
</b>
A hazy afternoon. A fair has come into town. They have set up in the vast parking
lot of the local high school.

A line of women has formed in front of the portable bathrooms.

The striking African American woman we saw giving birth is now standing in line.
She is older and somehow more beautiful.

She stands with a skinny, almost ethereal looking African American boy. The boy
wears a metal brace on his leg. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ELIJAH holds two oversized
stuffed animals in his arms. He looks back over his shoulder as THE SOUND OF
VOICES YELLING IN EXCITEMENT FILL THE AIR. His eyes dance over the many colorful
rides in the parking lot.

The door opens to one of the portable bathrooms. A woman steps out.

Elijah's mother touches his head and enters the three foot square plastic
bathroom. She turns back and gives him a look.

<b>tttt MOTHER
</b>ttWe'll play the water pistol
ttgame next.

Elijah nods, "Yes" happily.

The mother closes the cubicle door. Elijah is left alone amongst the line of
women. They stare at him blankly. Their eyes moves over his leg brace. Elijah
doesn't like it. He moves away from the line.

A CRESCENDO OF CHEERS RISES IN THE AIR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE FAIR. Elijah follows
the voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK.
CLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks.

For a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him.

He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile.

A man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in.

Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... "The Hurricane."

He watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat. They pull
the metal bars down in front of them.

The man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile.

Elijah stares up at the multi-colored sign. Beat. He moves quickly. Ducks under
the turnstile and climbs onto the platform.

Elijah finds and empty circular seat. He slips inside the gray metal compartment
and sits. He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him.

He looks around at all the excited faces. His eyes fill with excitement too.

His small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment. His
expression changes.

Elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms. He presses them to check their
softness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's
wedged in between them. Feels good.

He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah
looks a little anxious. Beat.

He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before
he ties the arms together. He checks its softness.

Elijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in. He smiles an
eight year old smile of pride.

<b>AND THEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHER'S VOICE.
</b>
He searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people. He hears her
calling.

<b>tttt MOTHER
</b>ttElijah...

She moves in his direction by chance. She finds herself at the entrance to The
Hurricane ride. She looks up at the sign above the turnstile. Her worried eyes
immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments.

Her eyes meet Elijah's. He waves. Her face goes very still.

A HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up.

Elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttI won't get hurt momma! I'm
ttsafe!

<b>HIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF MACHINERY.
</b>
The platform spins. He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped
man. She's pointing at Elijah.

The platform turns... Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's
angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him.

And then the ride speeds up.

The gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER.

Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face.

Suddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone
grabs the metal bars to hold on.

Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him
and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed
animal.

Elijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins. His hands slide over
the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels.

Elijah looks around... a sudden panic enters his eyes.

<b>THE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE STRIPED MEN.
</b>
THE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes directions
suddenly.

Elijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the
compartment. His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact. WE HEAR
<b>SOMETHING CRACK.
</b>
<b>TEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT. ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS OWN.
</b>
The ride spins its passengers. Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling
clouds in a mixture of agony and terror.

The ride changes directions.

Elijah is thrust forward. He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest.
<b>WE HEAR MORE CRACKS.
</b>
The world spins. Giggles and yells fill the air. Elijah slumps down onto the
floor of the compartment.

And then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual
stop.

<b>THE TEENAGERS MOAN.
</b>
Elijah is facing directly up at the sky. The clouds now move slowly over him.

<b>WE HEAR COMMOTION. AGITATED VOICES. HIS MOTHER'S DESPERATE VOICE.
</b>
tttt MOTHER(o.s.)
ttHis bones... He's not
ttwell...

<b>HER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM.
</b>
tttt MOTHER(o.s.)
ttElijah baby...

Then her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in. She begins to
scream.

Elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment. One arm is clutching his chest. The
other is curved horrifically like an "s". His mouth is open. His eyes are
bulging. The last thing we HERE ARE THE SHORT DESPERATE BREATHS of an eight year
old child about to black out from the pain.

<b>ttttttttFADE TO BLACK:

<b>PRESENT: EXT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON
</b>
WE EMERGE FROM BLACK to find news vans and reporters lining the street across
from a church. They have been cordoned off by a handful of police. Mourners are
recorded as they emerge from their cars and enter the church.

David is among the arriving crowd.

tttt MAN(o.s.)
ttDavid Dunne!

At hearing his name, David turns back as he walks. He can't tell which reporter
called his name because all of them seem to react. A storm of camera movement as
the group jockeys for the best angle of his troubled face.

David passes a magnetic board as he enters the church. It reads, "Services for
the families and friends of train 177."

David sits amongst the mourners in the standing room only church. His eyes drift
to a woman two rows ahead of him. She's turned around, looking at him. Her eyes
are red  from crying.

David looks away. His eyes stop on an old man far to his left just a few seats
away. Father, mother and daughter stare silently.

David surveys the entire church... Desperate inconsolable eyes question his
existence from every direction.

David has to look down.

David and the priest who conducted the mass are alone in the mass preparation

No cameras greet his exit. No people anywhere.

David walks across the now empty parking lot. His car is the only one left.

He walks to the driver's side. Pulls out his keys. That's as far as he gets.

His eyes catch sight of the GRAY ENVELOPE tucked under the windshield wiper of
his car.

David moves forward and gently pulls it out. His name is typed on the front. He
turns it over. Two embossed words on the back.

tttt "Limited Edition"

He opens the envelope. One line, handwritten, gazes at him from the gray index
card.

The line reads...

  "<I>How many days of your life have you been sick?</I>"

Nothing else is written.

David Dunne looks around the empty parking lot quietly.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:

A poorly lit changing room. A row of metallic lockers sits against one wall. A
bench splits the room. A brown folding table with Dunkin Donuts boxes and bagels
on it is crammed in the corner. A puke colored concrete floor sets the tone.

David and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes. They
all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts. The same two words are written on
all their backs...

"Stadium Security"

This ritual goes on without a word.

David walks along the massive curved wall around the outer rim of the stadium. As
he passes the different walkways we get glimpses of the enormous and empty
sixty-thousand seat football stadium on the inside.

David stops at a door marked "PERSONNEL".

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:

David knocks on the door as he steps into the cramped reception room to the
personnel office.

The SECRETARY, an ancient woman with thick flabby arms never stops typing and
never looks up as she talks.

</b>ttThat's a sad story.

ttDo you think you could ask

The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it
over a blank pad. Her left hand keeps typing. She never looks up.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. STADIUM FIELD - AFTERNOON
</b>
Rain falls in sheets in the stadium.

David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field. He
stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood. The poncho almost touches
the ground. The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away. We can barely
see David's face under the hood.

There is a football game in progress on the enormous field. The players seem
unusually small. There is no one in the stands. About four hundred people are on
the sidelines of the field watching the players. A soggy limping banner stretched
behind them declares, "The Pennslvania Elementary School Championships."

David's eyes scan the tiny figures on the field. His eyes come rest on a surge of
activity on the sidelines. Beat.

David steps out into the rain.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. SIDELINES - AFTERNOON
</b>
A handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other. They're in each other's
rain soaked faces. The scene feels on the verge of physical violence.

David and another security guard jog over. David steps in the middle of the tight
circle. The men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security. Everyone just
stands in the rain glaring at each other. Beat.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttYou know what I think about
ttto calm down? I think about
ttthose big fat, hundred and
tttwenty pound turtles that
ttlive in the islands. Those

ttlonger than all of us and
ttall they do all is sit on
ttthe beach and hump other

ttWhy don't we take a second
ttand think about the turtles?

Nobody moves. Rain washes over the agitated faces. A father breaks the moment.

<b>tttt FATHER
</b>ttYeah Jerry why don't you
ttthink about the fat ass
ttturtles... Like your fat ass
ttson on the field
ttjeopardizing the rest of our
ttchances at a fucking
ttchampionship.

David tenses. Everyone looks to JERRY. A bald man who stands just a foot away.
Jerry nods to himself. Looks like he's going to say something. Instead he lunges
forward and smashes a HEADBUTT to the man who spoke to him.

David tackles Jerry hard and fast. He drives him into the ground.

Blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who took the headbutt.

The other fathers start yelling and pushing each other. The remaining security
guard calls on his walkie for assistance.

David keeps Jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head lock that holds the
man's enraged face hard into the wet surface of the field.

David's eyes are not on Jerry. They gaze out onto the field where twenty two
elementary school boys have stopped playing and are standing frozen, helmets off,
rain washing over their faces. They watch in horror as their parents attack each
other on the sidelines.

David is the last one left. He's showered and back in his street clothes. He sits

A thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling. He watches a

She points to the window. Beat. Elijah gets up and moves to the only window in
the room.

The view from his room looks out over a narrow street. On the other side of the
street is a public playground. A handful of children are playing on it.

There are three benches to one side of the swings. On one of them is a THIN

He walks towards the bench with the present on it. Takes a seat. Puts the package
on his lap. It's flat. The edges of the bend down over his thin legs.

He undoes the white bow. He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper
together. He unfolds the paper. Beat.

The same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older. Elijah has grown
into a handsome, regal looking man. He leans on a walking stick.

He's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall. Two figures are
depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. One figure is
extremely muscular with a mask. The other is half human, half animal.

<b>tttt MAN
</b>ttThis is from Fritz

sketch.

<b>tttt ELIJAH

Elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art
gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books.

<b>tttt BUSINESS MAN
</b>ttMy kid's gonna go berserk.

Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns.

ttusual questions out of the
ttway. Why am I using a cane?
ttRaise your hand if you were
ttthinking that.

Jeremy raises his hand.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttI fractured my leg. It's the
ttfifth time I've done that
ttparticular bone. It didn't
ttreally heal well this time.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttRaise your hand is you're
ttwondering who the hell
ttbreaks the same bone five
tttimes?

Jeremy and David raise their hands.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttI have something called
ttOsteogenesis Imperfecta.
ttIt's a genetic disorder. I
ttdon't make this particular
tttype of protein very well
ttand it makes my bones very
ttlow in density, very easy to

ttThat ends our lecture on the

Elijah stares at his two rapt listeners.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttHow certain are you that you

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttSeventy-five percent.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttSeventy-five percent? That's
ttnot nearly good enough for

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttSkeptical about what?

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttYour answer to my question.
ttIt's one thing to have never
ttbeen injured in your life,
ttbut to state that you've
ttnever taken ill, well that's
tta whole new level.

<b>tttt JEREMY
</b>ttDad's been injured.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttWhat's he talking about?

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttIn college. A car accident.

</b>ttWas it serious?

David nods.

</b>ttHe couldn't play football

</b>ttI assumed because of the

Elijah closes his eyes. When his eyes open, the life force in them has
diminished. Beat.

ttYou can go now.

Elijah uses his cane to get up and walk back through the doors of the store.

<b>INT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON

David and Jeremy enter the store. Elijah leans on a walking stick before one of
the framed sketches. He gazes at it quietly.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttI think you skipped a couple
ttsteps.

Elijah turns.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttYou forgot the "Now I'm

ttStep.

ttWhat is over?

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttThe life of an idea that has
ttlived too long in my head.

David stares at Elijah impatiently.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttThere are probably only four
ttor five individuals in the
ttworld who can claim more
ttknowledge of comics than
ttmyself. I've spent a third
ttof my life in a hospital bed
ttwith nothing else to do but
ttread. I have studied the
ttform intimately. I have seen
ttthe patterns in them... The
ttreferences to social and
ttcultural events and the

ttthem. I've come to believe
ttthat comics are our last

ttpassing on history.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttThe Egyptians drew pictures
tton walls about battles, and
ttevents. Countries all around
ttthe world still pass on
ttknowledge through pictorial

ttI believe that comics, just

tttruth. They are depicting
ttwhat someone, somewhere felt

Elijah gazes at David.

David waits for Jeremy to exit the store. Beat.

David glares at Elijah.

David shakes his head. He smiles out of frustration. Beat.

ttBut I guess that's what you

Elijah stares carefully at David. Beat. David glances over to the entrance.
Jeremy watched through the window concerned.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttI'm going to leave now.
ttt(beat)
ttGood luck with your sale.

Elijah watches David walk towards the front door.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttWhat type of job do you have
ttDavid?

David opens the door. He looks back at Elijah.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttYou mentioned you've met

ttWhat type of job would that

Beat.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttI work at the stadium as a

Beat. David closes the door behind him. Elijah watches through the window as
Jeremy takes David's hand as they cross the street.

Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
<b>ALL LIGHTS ARE OUT EXCEPT THE SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP ON DAVID'S SIDE.
</b>
David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands.

Jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs.

David doesn't blink as he gazes at the headline silently...

<b>  "TRAIN CRASH DEATH TOLL CONFIRMED AT 131 DEAD. 1 SURVIVOR"
</b>
Beat. David slides out from under his son's legs. Jeremy stirs but doesn't wake
up.

David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room. He opens a closet door.

A NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the
narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB DOESN'T
<b>FALL ON JEREMY.
</b>
There's just enough room to stand and look around. David reaches up and pulls a
small travel bag out of the way. David stretches as he feels on the top shelf.

His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt. He unwraps it. It's a
handgun.

He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the
highest shelf.

He stretches even more. Reaches farther back. WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE ON THE
<b>SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD.
</b>
He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a
young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. The
word "Champion" is written over his head. David flips through the top clippings
- all are images and stories of David and football.

He turns the pile over. Goes to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded
over three times, unlike the others. He opens it.

It's a newspaper headline. It reads...

<b>"CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED"
</b>
David puts the new headline next to the old one... They look like a set. Even the
font is similar.

David stares at the old headline. Stares hard at the photo of the bent and
heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... The bulb
seems to flicker. David is utterly still.

SOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR. David gets startled.

He puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it
back to the top shelf and leaves the closet.

ANOTHER SOFT SET OF KNOCKS as David moves across the bedroom. He opens the door.

Megan stands in the darkened hall. Beat.

tttt DAVID(whisper)
ttHi.

Megan nods. Beat.

tttt MEGAN(whisper)
ttI've come to a decision.

tttt DAVID(whisper)
ttOh.

tttt MEGAN(whisper)
ttLet me just ask you

David nods, "yes."

tttt MEGAN(whisper)
ttHave you <u>been</u> with anyone?
ttSince we started having
ttproblems? The answer won't
ttaffect me.

Beat. David stares at his wife.

tttt MEGAN(whisper)
ttIt won't affect me either
ttway.

Beat. David doesn't say anything. He just nods, "No."

Megan's face starts to tremble. She starts crying. Tears roll over her very
affected face. She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. Beat.

tttt MEGAN(soft)
tt...My decision is... I'd
ttlike to start again. Pretend

ttIt's a big deal you walked

ttIf you want to ask me out

Megan nods and walks down the stairs as she wipes her face. David watches her
disappear into the shadows.

<b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  VETERAN'S STADIUM - AFTERNOON
</b>
Sunday afternoon. The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture perfect blue sky.
The Philadelphia Eagles pro football players are in uniform and doing stretches
on the field. The opposing team warms up on the other end of the field.

The sixty thousand seats are already half filled as fans stream in on every level
of the stadium.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:

</b>
A line of ticket holders snakes towards two turnstiles where stadium crew are
ripping tickets.

David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards.

The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles
paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he
tilts his head sideways. "We sleep with quarterbacks," is written in block
letters.

David stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms. The baby is
wearing an eagles uniform.

The WALKIE TALKIE on David's hip bursts to life. He pulls it off his hip an
listens.

<b>tttt WALKIE
</b>ttDunne, it's Jenkins, we got

David finds Elijah waiting to the side as the crowds funnel through the gate.
Elijah offers his hand as he walks up. David doesn't take it.

</b>ttThey said I couldn't get in

Elijah offers him the ticket. David inspects it.

David fights it. But he smiles anyway. Beat.

</b>ttI got this job because my
ttcollege coach called the guy

ttThere's no hidden meaning to
ttit.

David's walkie makes NOIES on his hip.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttThey need me at the gate.

David stares at Elijah leaning on his walking stick.

</b>ttDid you really want to see
ttthe game? I can get you in.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON

The line of fans outside the gate has tripled in size and intensity.

David and Elijah move along the line towards the turnstiles.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttIt gets heaviest ten minutes
ttbefore kickoff.

David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket. David looks backs at him and
continues walking.

David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttWhy don't we pat down?

David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to
him.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttJust give me a minute.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttIs there a problem?

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttThat guy in green. Sometimes

ttdowns of the crowd to
ttdiscourage people from
ttcarrying.
ttt(beat)
ttIf he's carrying, he'll step
ttout of line.

Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through
the turnstiles.

The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he
watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnsstile.

David eyes him. Fifteen people away... Ten...

The man coughs and steps out of the line. Elijah watches the green army jacket
melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the
stadium.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:

<b>INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - AFTERNOON

AN UNLIT arched concrete passageway. The SUNLIGHT from the stadium streams in
causing long shadows.

Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself.

<b>THE THUNDEROUS CHEERS OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND FANS IN THE STADIUM ECHOES FROM THE

David exhales slowly as he stares at Elijah.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttOkay, I don't want to play
ttthis game anymore.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttIt's an exaggeration of the

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttThe guy might not have been

The two men stand very still in the tunnel.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttYes. My wife Megan. She was

David turns and starts down the hall. David talks back over his shoulder.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttHave a good life Elijah and
tttry to buy your tickets at

Elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jogs down the darkness of
the tunnel.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
We are inside a customized car. The dashboard is covered in some sort of thin
foam padding. The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding. Every
corner and hard surface has been safe guarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel of
his car in the parking lot of the stadium. He sits as thoughts crash at his head.
Beat.

He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview
mirror and sees the man in the GREEN ARMY JACKET pass behind his car.

Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out
of the parking lot.

Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
Elijah's walking stick makes RHYTHMIC CLICKS on the concrete parking lot.

The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step.

Elijah starts breathing harder. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the
hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his
pace through the lot.

He gains on the army jacket.

tttt ELIJAH(calls out)
ttHold up for a second!

The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the
end of the parking lot. He looks back at Elijah for a beat. Doesn't like what he
sees. He disappears into the subway entrance.

Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful.
He makes it with great strain to the subway.

He looks into the entrance...

A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket
is glimpsed before it disappears.

Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing.

tttt ELIJAH(calls out)
ttI just want to ask you
ttsomething!

Elijah's VOICE ECHOES down the stairs. No response.

Elijah starts his descent.

<b>THE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS.
</b>
Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's
moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step.

His hand slips away from the railing...

He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. The FIRST SICKENING CRACK is
heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall.

The SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON THE METAL
<b>STAIRS.
</b>
He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway
landing. His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE ROAR OF
<b>THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN.
</b>
His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The
green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing
through the turnstile.

The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat
riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out
from the belt of his pants.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK
</b>
David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus
pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his
security clothes. The bus pulls away as he hears his SON'S VOICE.

David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are
having a touch football game. Jeremy runs out from the huddle across the field to
David.

<b>tttt JEREMY
</b>ttWas it sold out?

David nods, "No."

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttYou know how mad your mom

stands with the other children.

The basement is dominated by storage boxes and Christmas decorations. An old
bench press and weights are in a cluttered corner.

David sits and turns at the end of the bench as Jeremy laboriously carries and
places fifteen a pound weight on the bar. David talks over his shoulder.

</b>ttWhy don't you rest now? I'll
tttake it from here. You've

Jeremy is breathing hard as he puts the safety collars on the barbell and comes
around to David's end of the bench. David lays back.

</b>ttNo.

David takes hold of the barbell. Beat. He takes a deep breath.

The weight comes off the armrests of the bench. David lowers it to his chest and
pushes it back up. He does just one more rep with serious strain. He puts the
weight back on the armrest and sits up.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttHow much did you put on
ttthere?

David twists around and looks back at the barbell. He counts up the black metal
circles. He turns back to Jeremy.

Jeremy is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights and comes around
to David.

David lays back.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttNo.

David takes hold of the bar. Lifts it off the armrest. Brings it down. His arms
are straining hard again. He raises it and lowers it two time; it takes a sizable
effort. The weights bang down onto the armrest.

David sits up.

</b>ttHow much did you take off?

<b>tttt JEREMY
</b>ttI lied.

Beat.

on the steel bar. Beat.

Nobody says anything for a long time.

tttt JEREMY(soft)
ttHow much is it?

tttt DAVID(soft)
ttTwo hundred and seventy.

</b>ttWhy don't you move back a
ttbit? Just to be safe.

Jeremy moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house. He waits.

Another deep breath as David heaves. The weight CLINKS as it comes off the arm
rest. David is full out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms begin
to tremble as he lifts it for the second time. BANG the weight lands back safely
onto the rest.

David sits up. He looks at his son whose eyes are wide. Beat.

He talks to Jeremy who stands in his position at the bottom of the stairs without
looking at him.

Jeremy nods, "Yes."

ttGet mom.

David nods, "yes" before starting his deep breathing. He takes one last breath.
CLINK the weights comes off the rest. His arms are trembling immediately now. His
face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up
again two times before dropping it onto the armrest.

He slowly sits up.

ttAll of it.

A set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans are dangling by their metal
handles on the outside of each side of the weights.

The fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of David's chest. His arms
are shaking hard. He raises the weight to it's apex and brings it down again. It
touches his chest and rises up again. David's red strained face exhales
powerfully as he straightens his arms.

The bar lands on the armrest with A CRASH. The paint cans make METAL SQUEAKS as
they swing to stillness, one at a time. Beat.

David sits up and turns back to the weights. His mouth moves as he calculates the
discs and the cans.

His lips stop moving. Beat.

tttt JEREMY(soft)
ttHow much is it?

David doesn't react.

tttt JEREMY(soft)
ttHow much is it dad?

It takes a second for David to register the question. He looks to his son. Beat.

David turns and looks at his son. Jeremy's mouth is slightly open. He gazes at
his dad. Awe in his tiny eyes.

David Dunne stands in security uniform by a set of double doors that leads into
the players locker room.

Three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers. One side of the room
has benches and massage tables. The far end of the room has work out equipment.

About twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost
in their own pre-game rituals.

David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and
removes his dress shirt. His body is covered in old bruises. He lays down,
wincing a bit from the pain. A trainer begins to massage him.

David just stares at the battered athlete. His gaze moves across the room. Beat.

David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it.

He moves through the room of players and trainers. He moves to the one area of
the large room not occupied by anyone.

David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press. Racks and racks of
free weights sit behind the press.

David looks down at the thick silver bar. Three large black plates are on either
side. Six in all.

David looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing.
Beat. He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. Some of the
players have headphones on. Some are staring into space. A couple are on cell
phones...

No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off
the weight rack.

The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND...

A matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side...

And then David adds another. He matches it on the other side...

THE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat.

No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench.

David's hands take hold of the shiny bar.

He closes his eyes...

David's arms become tense. He pushes against the weight. It doesn't move.

His face turns deep red. He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps
training. His face and arms are shaking... He keeps staring... focusing.

And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest.

The weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His
arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up.

He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. It touches down with the
smallest of CLINKS.

David's fingers uncurl from the bar.

David lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick black discs.

David stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against

Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move.

David's eyes are looking down - his expression still - like he's listening.

He continues into the dead center of the tunnel. He's in the heaviest part of the

Megan stands next to David as he pulls out his wallet. The babysitter with the
black dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses stands ready to leave in the doorway.

<b>tttt DYED HAIR GIRL
</b>ttYou got two calls. One came
ttthrough while I was on the

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttWho called through?

Megan tries to hide her smile.

<b>tttt DYED HAIR GIRL
</b>ttSomeone from New York.

The smile instantly fades.

The babysitter fixes her Buddy Holly glasses as she looks at the two suddenly
quiet faces.

David hands her the money. She opens the door. It's started to rain.

<b>tttt DYED HAIR GIRL
</b>ttGreat.

The babysitter covers her head with her jacket and runs down the walkway. David
closes the door. Beat.

</b>ttLook let's be honest here.
ttWe're just at the beginning.
ttI don't expect you or I to

The master bedroom is very narrow. A bathtub and toilet are at one end. Two
identical sinks sit opposite each other.

David sits on the edge of the tub. His shirt is unbuttoned. He sits in a daze
staring at the tiled floor.

His eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of
the sinks.

David rises and picks it up.

It's a BOX OF BAND AIDS. David looks up to Megan's sink. Perfume and lotions sit
on its edge.

David opens her mirrored cabinet. He starts to put the band aid box back, he
hesitates.

His eyes begin to roam the cabinet shelves. They stop on certain items... A
<b>CONTAINER OF TYLENOL... A LOTION FOR DRY SKIN... A BOTTLE OF ALLERGY DROPS...
</b><b>COUGH SYRUP...  A TUBE OF MUSCLE PAIN OINTMENT...
</b>
David just stands quietly for a beat before turning and looking across to his own
identical mirrored medicine cabinet.

There are three things on the shelf... DISPOSABLE RAZORS. SHAVING CREAM. AND

David's mouth opens just a little bit as he stares.

David moves through the darkness down the stares in jeans and a sweatshirt.

He moves to the coat closet. Pulls out the dark green rain poncho. The word
"security" is almost faded away.

He opens and closes the front door with virtually NO SOUND.

David's car pulls into the massive rain station parking lot.

David steps out and pulls the hood of the poncho over his head.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. METAL STAIRS - NIGHT
</b>
A steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of
interconnected tracks below. David walks down about forty feet. A fenced gate
with a lock stops his progress.

David looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a
construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area
next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station
grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can
only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away
from the immaculately lit train station.

Beat. A HUGE METALLIC CRACK ECHOES THROUGH THE TRAIN YARD as David kicks open the
fence door that holds him back from going down.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT
</b>
Frightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain. David walks along the
body of the caved-in passenger car.

The passenger car is split in two. Just before the tear, along the window line,
the windows have been crushed in. A huge hole has been ripped below the windows
exposing the ravaged interior.

David stands before this heavily damaged area of the car. He just stares at the
wreckage. Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face.

His eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal. He takes a couple slow
breaths as THE SOUNDS OF HARSH RAIN FADE AWAY TO SILENCE.

SILENCE. BLACK. OUR VISION CLEARS TO REVEAL the glazed icy top of a street.

<b>THE SOUND OF DISTANT FIRE COMES INTO THE SILENCE.
</b>
A TWENTY YEAR OLD DAVID DUNNE rises to his feet from the ground where he was
laying amongst the fragmented pieces of windshield. He looks down at himself. His
football jacket is torn. So are his jeans... He's trembling slightly, but not
bleeding.

<b>HE LOOKS UP TOWARDS THE NOISES.
</b>
About thirty feet away is a Honda, upside down, wrapped around a telephone pole.
It's front is on fire.

Through one of the crushed door windows, WE SEE A WOMAN'S HAND.

Young David heads toward his car. He slips a couple of times on the slick iced
surface of the road.

He kneels down next to the inverted car. He looks in the crushed window frame.

THE FACE OF A TWENTY YEAR OLD MEGAN IS UPSIDE DOWN. She is unconscious.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttMegan...

She doesn't answer. Her body is twitching as it sits pinned behind the wheel.

David pulls at the handle of the mangled door. It's wedged tight. It won't move.

The heat from the fire is tremendous.

David's powerful arms keep pulling with all their strength.

<b>WE HEAR THE CREAK OF METAL... THE DOOR BENDS UNNATURALLY AND THEN PRACTICALLY
</b><b>RIPS OPEN.
</b>
David leans into the car and unbuckles Megan. He works her out underneath the
steering column. He slides out. Her leg is bleeding.

David picks her up and carries her to the grass next to the road. He lays her
down gently.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttMegan?

He just stares at her. She doesn't respond.

A LIGHT WASHES OVER THEM. David turns to see a truck approaching up the road.
David waves frantically. The truck slows.

David turns back to Megan. Her eyes are open.

Tears fall from David's face as he moves the hair out of her eyes. She looks at
David.

tttt MEGAN(soft)
ttI thought I was dead.

Beat.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttMe too.

The driver of the truck slips and slides his way over to David.

</b>ttIs she all right?

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttI think her leg is
ttfractured.

<b>tttt DRIVER

driver.

tttt DAVID(soft)
ttMy shoulder's hurt.

The driver nods.

<b>tttt DRIVER
</b>ttHold on. I got a C.B. in the

He follows THE SOUND to a PHONE RINGING in the storage room of the store. There
are shelves and shelves of comic books. Thousands of them filed away in neat

Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath.

<b>INT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

The interior of the station is a mystical sight. One huge cavernous room, a
football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a
misty hand painted ceiling.

tttt ELIJAH(v.o.)
ttDavid, it's okay to be
ttafraid. Because this part
ttwon't be like a comic
ttbook... Real life doesn't
ttfit into little boxes that
ttwere drawn for it.

David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and
departing late night trains. Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic
throughout the station.

tttt ELIJAH(v.o.)
ttGo to where people are...
ttYou won't have to look very
ttlong.

David stares out at the midnight travelers. Beat. He starts towards them.

He passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station. It
watches over the whole building. It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier
to heaven.

David moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving
passengers from tracks one and two. They brush by him and lightly bump him as
they move.

<b>FLASH CUT: WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE TRAIN STATION. A BLOND WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES

<b>SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards
the exit of the train station. He doesn't stop moving.

David heads towards the densest part of the floor. The area near the information
board. Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait. A steady
spider-like web of movement flows as six  tracks let out on either side.

David moves to the center. His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor. Lines
of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either
side of him.

David looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side.
His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by.

Dozens and dozens of people pass. Nothing happens. Then a man in a crumpled shirt
and slicked back hair brushes by...

<b>FLASH CUT: THE SLICKED BLACKED HAIRED MAN LEANS OUT THE WINDOW OF A TRUCK. HE'S

David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and

Beat. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep
breaths as he gathers himself.

Then David steps back to look around. HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing
behind him.

David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus.

The enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle. He turns it.
The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him.

The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening...
It opens slowly anyway.

<b>SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:

David stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable.

David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing
shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and
then finally onto the man.

He's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive.
He's wearing a one piece ORANGE UNIFORM.

The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the
full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full
trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it.

David watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked "Station
Maintenance Staff Only".

Four identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his
bin inside.

David waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. Nothing happens for the
longest time... No one comes out. David makes a decision. He starts towards the
doors.

And then they open.

The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's
wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit.

David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him.

<b>EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city
block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at
this late hour. No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet
behind.

The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The
uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves.

He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail
out of the mailbox.

David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He
stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks
over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled
house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:

<b>INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

The side door opens with almost no sound. The hooded figure of David Dunne steps
into a narrow laundry room. THE SOUND OF A TELEVISION IS HEARD FROM ANOTHER ROOM.

A very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. Two or
three days worth.

David shuts the door very slowly.

<b>THE SOUNDS OF CHEERING FROM THE TELEVISION IN THE NEXT ROOM SPILL INTO THE

David stares out from under his hood at the mess.

Cabinets are left open. Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of
unwashed dishes. The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. It sits
frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of
colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two
cockroaches are crawling in the bowl.

David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets
closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open
quietly.

A SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom
of the stairs is a MAN'S BODY. The same man who answered the door in the
flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. His crumpled tie lies
folded over itself on his still chest.

David steps into the unoccupied room. His movements are slow and tense.

THUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM. David looks up and
follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM.

David moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE TELEVISION.

Three closed doors converge on a landing. David opens the closest one.

It's a young girl's room. Posters of boy bands are on her wall. Clothes are

<b>A NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE BEDROOM.

A slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists
with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. She sits with her arms
pointed upward over her head. He knees tucked up to her chest.

Next to her is her younger brother. A skinny boy, maybe twelve. He's tied and
seated in the same way.

Their heads are leaned back against their arms. They're completely listless. Eyes
half mast. They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded
figure of David Dunne steps in. His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping
water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them.

They don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them.
They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them.
They boy blinks once slowly.

David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood.

<b>INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

An exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes
hanger long ago. The t.v. across the bed has framed family photos displayed on
top of it.

David's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the
other side of the bedroom.

A woman is tied to the bathroom door handle. She sits on the tiled floor slumped
against the door. Her eyes stare blankly at the ground. She has considerable
bruises on her face and arms.

David stands before her.

tttt DAVID(soft)
ttWhere is he?

The woman doesn't answer, but a SOUND COMES FROM THE SCREEN DOOR nearby. The
curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside.

David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. It leads to a small balcony.
An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it.

David steps onto the balcony and looks down.

The rain still pours down unmercifully. It comes down on a black tarp that covers
a pool in the backyard.

David turns to go back inside.

<b>A BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM.
</b>
The collision is sudden and explosive. The huge man drives his shoulder into
David's chest and takes him off his feet. David's body flips over the railing.

The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly
towards the black tarp.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:

David lands on his stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP onto the nylon black tarp.

There's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface. David is laying on his
cheek. Half his face is covered in water.

Beat. David's exposed eye looks around in a daze. The surface of  the tarp gets
pounded by the rain.

David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water
as his pressure pushes the tarp down.

<b>THE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START.
</b>
David stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the
tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place.

The tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY.

One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the
edge of the pool.

And then without warning, the tarp caves in. It folds around David as he and the
tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:

The last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place
around the edge of the pool.

The rain keeps falling.

The tarp moves like it's alive underwater. It shifts and wraps David tighter with
every movement.

<b>GLIMPSES OF LIGHT AGAIN. TWO SMALL FIGURES NOW STAND IN A BLURRED SILHOUETTE NEAR

</b><b>POLE... IT'S SHAKY NEBULOUS IMAGE WAIVERS IN THE AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE.
</b>
David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole.

The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the
pool. David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. He takes hold of the
pool's edge.

Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of
the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground.

He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain
poncho covering him like a blanket. Beat.

He rises to his feet. The water rushes off of him. His breathing is slowing,
calming.

He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. He turns and looks to the
two small figures standing near the edge of the pool.

The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. They're holding an
aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. They stare up at the
hooded figure.

No one says anything.

The man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door
handle of the bathroom. His back is to us. He's drinking from a beer bottle as he
looks down at her.

He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move
closer. Right behind him.

The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching
over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth.

David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp
together like and iron vise. He squeezes.

The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed.

David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back
violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard
stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL.

The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall.
David's arm remains locked around his throat.

The man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm.
He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The
room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood.

And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in
David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate
blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go.

The elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle.

David pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his
tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE
APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking.

David keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just
dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the
carpet now.

David slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the
man's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat.

David's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw.
The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE
ROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat.

He moves to the woman slumped against the door. He starts to untie the phone
cords that bind her wrists to the handle. He whispers to her.

tttt DAVID(soft)
ttIt's over now.
ttt(beat)
ttYour children are fine.
ttThey're getting help.

He unties her wrists. Her arms stay above her head where they were.

tttt DAVID(soft)
ttI'm going to go now.

He stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him. She sits unnaturally
still against the door with her arms above her head. The mascara that has run
down her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down.

David moves his hand near her mouth and nose. He checks for the feeling of breath
against his hand. Beat.

He rises up. Removes his hood. David Dunne stands silently in the master bedroom
of someone's house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped position
against her bathroom door.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT
</b>
The front door opens to SILENCE. The silhouetted figure of David steps into the
darkness of his home.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. CLOSET - NIGHT
</b>
The dark green faded security poncho gets hung back on its hook in the closet
next to the family winter coats.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
David enters the quiet of Jeremy's room. Jeremy lays sound asleep. David stares
down at the shadowy figure of his son.

He pulls the blanket over the boy's small shoulder.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
David sits on the edge of the empty bed in the darkness of his room.

He doesn't makes a sound. He doesn't move an inch. He is so still, he seems to
disappear into the shadows of the room.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Megan stirs in her sleep. She shifts her head on the pillow.

Then her body RISES INTO THE AIR.

She starts to wake as she floats across the room. She opens her eyes and sees
David close by. He's carrying her in her arms. He moves up the stairs with her.
No words are spoken.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
They enter their bedroom. David lays her down gently on her side of the bed.

She watches as he walks out of sight. He lays down right behind her.

He covers her with his arm... His hand is shaking. Beat. He speaks softly.

tttt DAVID(soft)
ttI had a bad dream.

David tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes.

Megan lays stunned in her husband's arms. Beat.

tttt MEGAN(soft)
ttIt's over now.

She closes her eyes too as the tears start coming.

<b>ttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
Downtown Philadelphia.

People move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts. David Dunne is
among them.

He crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition. The front doors of the
store are open.

A banner over the door reads, "Annual Sale."

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. LIMITED EDITION - DAY
</b>
The compact store is crowded with customers.

David spots Elijah with a group of people before a framed painting of a comic
hero.

David moves to a less crowded area of the store and waits. He turns and looks at
a framed sketch.

Beat. An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins David.

<b>tttt WOMAN
</b>tt...See the villain's eyes.
ttThey're larger than the
ttother characters'. They
ttinsinuate a slightly skewed
ttperspective of how they see
ttthe world. Just off normal.

David stares at the drawing.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttHe doesn't look very
ttthreatening.

<b>tttt WOMAN
</b>ttThat's what I said to my
ttson. He said, there's always
tttwo kinds. The soldier
ttvillain who fights the hero
ttwith his hands, and then
ttthere's the real threat. The
ttbrilliant and evil arch
ttenemy who fights the hero
ttwith his mind.

David turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her
sixties who stands next to him.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttAre you Elijah's mother?

The woman turns and looks at David for the first time.

<b>tttt ELIJAH'S MOTHER
</b>ttI am. I'm helping him with
ttthe sale.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttIt's a pleasure to meet you.
ttI'm David Dunne.

<b>tttt ELIJAH'S MOTHER
</b>ttHe's spoken of you. He says
ttyou're becoming friends.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttWe are.

David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttHe's doing well today.

<b>tttt ELIJAH'S MOTHER
</b>ttI'm very proud of him.
ttt(beat)
ttHe's been through a lot in
tthis life. A lot of ups and
ttdowns, a lot of bad spells.
ttA couple I'd thought had
ttbroken him... I mean
ttemotionally.
ttt(beat)
ttThey were bad... But he made
ttit. Yes he did.

<b>tttt DAVID
</b>ttHe's kind of a miracle.

<b>tttt ELIJAH'S MOTHER
</b>ttYes he is.

They both watch Elijah from across the room.

<b>tttt ELIJAH'S MOTHER
</b>ttI'll tell him you're here.

David watches as Elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for Elijah to
finish talking.

David turns back to the framed sketch. He looks at it with his hands in his
pockets. Beat.

David's stare turns into a gaze. His gaze turns into stillness.

THE SKETCH is of a withered man with large tense eyes. He sits in the shadows.
He's seated in some type of machine. There are lots of buttons and levers on the
machine. The machine has wheels.

David turns from the sketch. He looks across the room to Elijah seated in his
wheelchair. Elijah's large eyes stay focused on the customer's as he finishes
negotiating.

David turns back to the sketch. He looks at it with growing confusion. The more
you look at drawing, the more the machine the man is seated in looks like a
wheelchair.

David looks back across the store. Elijah and his mother are talking. Elijah has
spotted David.

Beat. Elijah starts across the crowded store towards David. He wheels up to him.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttDid you see this?

Elijah has a newspaper on his lap. He holds it up.

There's a drawing on the front page. It's a hooded figure shielding two huddled
children behind him.

tttt ELIJAH(soft)
ttIt has begun.

David stares quietly at the sketch of himself.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttWhen I saw it this morning.
ttI felt a part of the world
ttagain.

Elijah looks down at the newspaper.

David hesitates and then reaches forward.

He reaches past the paper... And TOUCHES ELIJAH'S ARM.

<b>FLASHCUT: AN AIRPORT GATE. ELIJAH IS STANDING AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT ONTO THE
</b><b>AIRFIELD. HE'S CRYING.
</b>
<b>SIRENS START SOUNDING THROUGHOUT THE AIRPORT.
</b>
<b>WAITING PASSENGERS START GETTING UP AND MOVING TO THE WINDOWS.
</b>
<b>tttt MAN
</b>ttWhat's going on?

Elijah speaks to no one in particular as he stares out the window with tortured
eyes.

<b>tttt ELIJAH
</b>ttA plane just crashed.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:

</b>ttSecrets?

tttt ELDERLY MAN(whispers)
ttLike if there was ever a

</b>

</b>ttPassengers aren't allowed in
ttthere.

Elijah doesn't answer and doesn't turn around as he exits train 177.

<b>SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:
</b>
David takes two unsteady steps back. Elijah has tears in his eyes as he gazes
down at the newspaper. He looks up to David.

tttt ELIJAH(low voice)
ttI almost gave up hope. There
ttwere so many times I
ttquestioned myself. I've made
ttso many sacrifices but it's
ttall been worth it.
ttt(beat)
ttThere are millions and
ttmillions or mediocre people
ttin the world David. Isn't it
ttgreat that we aren't one of
ttthem?

David looks like he stopped breathing as he backs up in the store.

Customers step between him and Elijah. Elijah becomes obscured and then blocked
from view.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
David emerges from the store slowly. He braces himself against a parked car and
then keeps on walking in a nightmarish daze.

WE PULL BACK as David Dunne blends in with dozens and dozens of ordinary people,
walking on an ordinary street, in an ordinary city.
