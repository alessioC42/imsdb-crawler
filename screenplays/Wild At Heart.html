tttt     a love story

tttt     written by
tttt     David Lynch

tttt based on the book by
tttt     Barry Gifford



And now the story of Sailor and Lula.....




<b>1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to 
maximum R.P.M. up the street.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE
</b>
The sign reads x93KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPSx94.

</b>

<b>3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black x9266 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY
</b>
Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each otherx92s 
flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.

<b>ttttOLD WOMAN
</b>ttOh my God! ... Why they doinx92 that?

<b>ttttOLD MAN
</b>ttWho the hell knows.  What you have
ttin your mouth?

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

<b>ttttOLD MAN 
</b>ttSpit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth
ttout ... doctor said.  What you 
tttryinx92 to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!!

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a 
tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>5. WASP NEST
</b>
A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A 
SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 
nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

<b>6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
The telephone rings.  MARIETTA PACE FORTUNE, a rich Southern woman 
around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across 
the livingroom and answers the phone.

<b>ttttMARIETTA
</b>ttHello...  Who is this?...

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>7. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY
</b>
A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost 
somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman 
- speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench.

<b>ttttSAILOR
</b>ttt(into phone)
tt...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk 
ttto Lula?

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

<b>6B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

<b>ttttMARIETTA
</b>tt...Yes you heard me...  Donx92t ever

Marietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, Mariettax92s twenty-year 
old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs.

<b>ttttLULA
</b>ttMama???

<b>ttttMARIETTA
</b>ttYou know who it was and you know 
ttyou arenx92t, and I mean ARE NOT

Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard 
her knuckles turn white.

<b>8. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LULAx92S ROOM UPSTAIRS - DAY

Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo.  Speed metal music jumps 
up to around one hundred twenty decibels.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>9. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY
</b>
The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.  
The iron bars of the door slide across Sailorx92s face and close with a 
bang.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>10. EXT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT
</b>
A beat-up, red x9264 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane 
TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the 
club - leaning out the car in every direction.  They scream out to the 
desolate-looking passerby.

<b>ttttTEENAGERS
</b><b>ttEAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!
</b>
The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot 
pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

<b>11. INT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT
</b>
Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas 
while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH 
BOYS.  The group segues smoothly from Elmore Jamesx92s x93Dust my Broomx94 
into Robert Johnsonx92s x93Me and the Devilx94 and Beany lets out a snort.

<b>ttttBEANY
</b>ttI can dig this music...  But not 
ttthat singer.

<b>ttttLULA
</b>ttWhy?...  Hex92s right in the groove.

<b>ttttBEANY
</b>ttYeah, well, if he says that all that
ttflab turns into dick at midnight,

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

<b>ttttBEANY
</b>ttSo, Sailorx92s gettinx92 out soon, and
ttyoux92re gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

<b>ttttLULA
</b>ttMeetinx92 him at the gate.  That phone
ttcall this afternoon was the signal.
ttMy deranged mamax92s hid the keys to
ttmy car.  But of course, I know 
ttexactly where they are.

<b>ttttBEANY
</b>ttI didnx92t hate me so much, Ix92d feel

Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the

They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while 
Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

ttYou mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulax92s breasts.

<b>ttttLULA
</b>ttYou remind me of my daddy, you know?

exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to Sailor.

<b>ttttLULA
</b>ttIt was a year before I met you.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lulax92s hand and puts it into the 
ashtray by her bed.  He pulls her to him and kisses her throat.

<b>ttttSAILOR
</b>ttYou have such a pretty, long neck,

blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as shex92d started.  
Her grey eyes glaze over.

the dogs.

Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  
Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 
alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 
the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 
the arm.

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 
squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 
green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 
wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 
had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

</b>ttI donx92t know, honey, but we gotta

Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 
a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

</b>ttI canx92t take this, Sailor.  Shex92s

forehead.

ttGet my lipstick...

ttItx92s in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 
starts to cry.

</b>ttShe died right in front of me.  Whyx92d
ttshe have to go and do that, Sailor?

<b>ttttSAILOR
</b>ttLetx92s get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girlx92s forehead 
down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 
gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 
around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  
Sailor starts the car and takes off.

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of

front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

Rayx92s brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 
SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and 
doesnx92t stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobbyx92s right 
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 
his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the

when you get out.

I feel like Ix92m kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, itx92ll be over and Ix92ll have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I donx92t know how much or what it 
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
youx92re thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyx92re spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  Ix92m going to move out as
soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyx92re lookinx92
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

<b>ttttSAILOR
</b>ttt(voice-over)

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 
And Pace being your family name and all is just right.
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 
granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though
he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youx92re
gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.
Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

Six years later...  Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of 
ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is 
wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a 
Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an 
ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the 
livingroom as she talks on the phone.

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 
causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 
to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 
driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

<b>ttttPACE
</b>ttMama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 
she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 
window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 
is clamped in her teeth.

of her mouth and drops it.

</b>ttDamn it, child!  Now look what you

Sailor smiles.

</b>ttFirst pack of tailor-mades I had in

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with 
Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

</b>ttYou must be my son.

<b>ttttLULA
</b>ttShake hands with your daddy.

Pace releases Lulax92s hand and puts his own in Sailorx92s.  Sailor grips it 
gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

<b>ttttSAILOR
</b>ttPleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read
tta lot about you.

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them 
loose.  Sailor tries to smile.

the wheel hard.  Suddenly, she pulls over to the side of the road, turns 
off the engine and gets out of the car.

<b>ttttSAILOR

Sailor goes around to the driverx92s side, reaches in and pulls the keys 
out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and 
closes the lid.

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks 
down her face.

ECU of Lulax92s eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and 
down her cheeks as in Sailorx92s dream.

TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around 
him, coming in closer for the kill.

<b>ttttSAILOR
</b>ttWhat do you faggots want?

Thatx92s all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend 
himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood 
begins to pour from his swelling nose.


<b>162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILORx92S FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

Sailorx92s eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  
His mouth speaks through closed lips.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he 
jumps on the hood of Lulax92s car.

She sees him.

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a 
giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes 
away.  Lulax92s gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 
but now she knows what it is.  It is Pacex92s happy, smiling eyes looking 
up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulax92s eyes and sings x93Love 
Me Tender.x94 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.
