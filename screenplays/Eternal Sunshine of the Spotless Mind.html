<b>INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY
</b>
It's grand and modern.  Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched
on the wall in large gold letters.  An old woman enters
carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages.  She
seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly.  The young receptionist,
dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.

<b>ttRECEPTIONIST
</b>tOh, hi.

<b>ttOLD WOMAN
</b>tt(apologetically)
tHi, I was in the neighborhood and thought
tI'd see --

<b>ttRECEPTIONIST
</b>tI think he's in a conference.
tUnfortunately.  I'm really sorry.

<b>ttOLD WOMAN
</b>tWould you just try him?  You never know.
tAs long as I'm here.  You never know.

<b>ttRECEPTIONIST
</b>tOf course.  Please have a seat.

The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her
lap.  She stares politely straight ahead.

<b>ttRECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
</b>tt(quietly into headset)
tIt's her -- I know, but couldn't you just
t-- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's
told and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.
tt(to old woman)
tI'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now.
tIt's a crazy time of year for us.

The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the
corner.  Its ornaments are holograms.

<b>ttOLD WOMAN
</b>tThis book -- It's essential that people
tread it because --
tt(gravely, patting the
tt manuscript)
t-- It's the truth.  And only I know it.

<b>ttRECEPTIONIST
</b>tt(nodding sympathetically)
tMaybe after the holidays then.

<b>INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway
hall.  She stops to catch her breath, then continues and
passes several archway with letters printed above them.  When
she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a
slot.  A plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  She
sits in the chair; it rises.

<b>INT. TUBE -DAY
</b>
The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a
line of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  The other
chairs are peopled with commuters.  We stay with the woman as
she and the others travel over New York City in the tube.
There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the
skyline.  The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap.
It's called:

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

This serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits
follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes.
Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.

<b>INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER
</b>
Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall,
magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic
seascape paintings on the walls.  The receptionist, Mary, 25,
can be seen typing in the reception area.  Behind her are
shelves and shelves of medical files.  The door opens and
Clementine enters.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a
faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's
decidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tMay I help you?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(approaching reception area)
tYeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr.
tMierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tYes, please have a seat.  He'll be right
twith you.

Clementine sits.  She looks tired, maybe hungover.  She picks
up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.

<b>INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Mary pads down the hallway.  She knocks on a closed door.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK (O.S.)
</b>tYes?

Mary opens the door, peeks in.  Howard Mierzwiak, 40's,
professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tHoward, your one o'clock.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tt(not looking up)
tThanks, Mary.  You can bring her in.

She smiles and nods.  It's clear she's in love.  It's equally
clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue.  Mary turns to
leave.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
</b>tt(looking up)
tMary...

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(turning back)
tYes?

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tOrder me a pastrami for after?

<b>ttMARY
</b>tCole slaw, ice tea?

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tt(nodding)
tThanks.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tWelcome, Howard.

She smiles and heads down the hall.  Stan, 30's, tall,
spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tBoo.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tHi.

She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tBarely seen you all morning, kiddo.

He leans in to kiss her.  She cranes her neck to keep him
off.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(reprimanding whisper)
tStan... c'mon...

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tSorry.  I just --

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(somewhat guiltilly)
tIt's just...y'know... I mean...

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tI know.  Anyway --

<b>ttMARY
</b>tAnyway, I've got to do my tap
tdance here.

She indicates the door to the reception area.  Stan nods.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tSee you later, alligator.

<b>ttMARY
</b>t'kay.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tHey, if you're ordering lunch for
tMierzwiak, would you --

<b>ttMARY
</b>tI better do this, Stan.

Stan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room.

<b>ttMARY (CONT'D)
</b>tMs. Kruczynski?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (O.S.)
</b>tHi.

After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway.  Mary
leads her down the hall, not looking back.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(professionally courteous)
tHow are you today?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOkay, I guess.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(at Mierzwiak's office)
tHere we are.

Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tMs. Kruczynski, please come in.

Clementine enters the office.  Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and
closes the door, leaving them alone.

<b>INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee
table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues.  Mierzwiak
sits across from her.  He smiles.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tHow are you today?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOkay, I guess.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tt(nodding sympathetically)
tWell, why don't you tell me what's going
ton?  Do you mind if I turn this on?

He indicates a tape recorder.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI don't care.

He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tWell, I've been having a bad time of it
twith um, my boyfriend, I guess.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tYou guess he's your boyfriend?  Or you
tguess you're having a bad time with hm?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhat?  No.  I don't like the term
tboyfriend.  It's so gay.

Mierzwiak nods.  He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral
throughout.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tMaybe gay isn't the right word.  But,
tanyway, it's been rough with him...
twhatever the fuck he is.  Heheh.  My
tsignificant other... heh heh.  And I
tguess on a certain level, I want to break
tit off, but I feel... y'know... it's like
tthis constant questioning and re
tquestioning.  Do I end it?  Should I give
tit more time?  I'm not happy, but what do
tI expect?  Relationships require work.
tYou know the drill.  The thing that I
tkeep coming back to is, I'm not getting
tany younger, I want to have a baby... at
tsome point... maybe... right?  So then I
tthink I should settle -- which is not
tnecessarily the best word -- I mean, he's
ta good guy.  It's not really settling.
tThen I think maybe I'm just a victim of
tmovies, y'know?  That I have some
tcompletely unrealistic notion of what a
trelationship can be.  But then I think,
tno, this is what I really want, so I
tshould allow myself the freedom to go out
tand fucking find it.  You know?  Agreed?
tBut then I think he is a good guy and...
tIt's complicated.  Y'know?

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tI think I know. I think we can help.  Why
tdon't you start by telling me about your
trelationship.  Everything you can think
tof.  Everything about him.  Everything
tabout you.  And we'll take it from there.

She nods, thinks.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tUm, well, he's a fucking tidy one --

<b>EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION
</b>
<b>SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER
</b>
The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.  He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a
briefcase.  The platform across the tracks from him is empty.
Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He
climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty
platform.  Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that
platform.  Joel gets on and watches the business commuters
through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the
station.

<b>EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER
</b>
Joel talks on a phone.  The wind howls around him.  He tries
to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHi, Cindy.  Joel.  Listen, I'm not
tfeeling well this morning.  No.  Food
tpoisoning, I think.  Sorry it took me so
tlong to call in, but I've been vomiting.

<b>EXT. BEACH - DAY
</b>
Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase.  He
passes an old man with a metal detector.  They nod at each
other.

Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.

Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  He
opens it and writes with a gloved hand.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tJanuary 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work
tand took the train out to Montauk.
tt(thinks)
tIt's cold.
tt(thinks some more)
tThe sky is gray.
tt(thinks some more)
tI don't know what else to say.  Nothing
thappens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi
tlast night.  We had sex.  It was weird to
tfall into our old familiar sex life so
teasily.  Like no time has passed.  After
ttwo years apart suddenly we're talking
tabout getting together again.  I guess
tthat's good.

He has no other thoughts.  He glances up, spots a female
figure in the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands
out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded
sweatshirt.  It's Clementine.  He watches her for a bit, then
as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least
pretends to.  Once she passed, he watches her walk away.  She
stops and stares out at the ocean.  Joel writes.

<b>ttJOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>tIf I'm constitutionally incapable of
tmaking eye-contact with a woman I don't
tknow.  I guess I'd better get back to
tNaomi.

Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
season.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window.

Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.

<b>INT. DINER - DAY
</b>
It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel sits
in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of
tomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter.
Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel
glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth
and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress
approaches her with a coffee pot.

<b>ttWAITRESS
</b>tCoffee?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tGod, yes.  You've saved my life!

The waitress pours the coffee.

<b>ttWAITRESS
</b>tYou know what you want yet?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(laughing)
tAin't that the question of the century.

The waitress is not amused.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tYou got grilled cheese and tomato soup?

<b>ttWAITRESS
</b>tYeah.  We're having a run on it.

The waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her
bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,
pours something in, then brings the cup back up.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(calling)
tAnd some cream, please.

Clementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's
before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He
looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine
pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel glances
up, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read the
title.

<b>EXT. BEACH - DAY
</b>
Joel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine
stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at
the ocean.

<b>EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine
enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.
She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes
a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his
hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to
conceal his awkwardness.

<b>INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER
</b>
Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door
between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up.
Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding
where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching
him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally:

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(calling over the rumble)
tHi!

Joel looks over.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm sorry.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhy?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWhy what?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhy are you sorry?  I just said hi.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo, I didn't know if you were talking to
tme, so...

She looks around the empty car.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tReally?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(embarrassed)
tWell, I didn't want to assume.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tAw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the
tleap and assume someone is talking to you
tin an otherwise empty car.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tAnyway.  Sorry.  Hi.

Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tIt's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't
thave to scream.  Not that I don't need to
tscream sometimes, believe me.
tt(pause)
tBut I don't want to bug you if you're
ttrying to write or something.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really
tthink of much to say probably.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOh.  So...

She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she
came from.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI mean, it's okay if you want to sit down
there.  I didn't mean to --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNo, I don't want to bug you if you're
ttrying to --

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's okay, really.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tJust, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
tI have a long trip ahead of me.
tt(sits across aisle from Joel)
tHow far are you going?  On the train, I
tmean, of course.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tRockville Center.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tGet out!  Me too!  What are the odds?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThe weirder part is I think actually I
trecognize you.  I thought that earlier in
tthe diner.  That's why I was looking at
tyou.  You work at Borders, right?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tUcch, really?  You're kidding.  God.
tBizarre small world, huh?  Yeah, that's
tme: book slave there for, like, five
tyears now.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tReally?  Because --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tJesus, is it five years?  I gotta quit
tright now.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>t-- because I go there all the time.  I
tdon't think I ever saw you before.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWell, I'm there.  I hide in the back as
tmuch as is humanly possible.  You have a
tcell phone?  I need to quit right this
tminute.  I'll call in dead.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't have one.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'll go on the dole.  Like my daddy
tbefore me.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI noticed your hair.  I guess it made an
timpression on me, that's why I was pretty
tsure I recognized you.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tAh, the hair.
tt(pulls a strand in front of her
tt eyes, studies it)
tBlue, right?  It's called Blue Ruin.  The
tcolor.  Snappy name, huh?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI like it.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tBlue ruin is cheap gin in case you were
twondering.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.  Tom Waits says it in --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tExactly!  Tom Waits.  Which song?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI can't remember.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tAnyway, this company makes a whole line
tof colors with equally snappy names.  Red
tMenace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
tThat'd be a job, coming up with those
tnames.  How do you get a job like that?
tThat's what I'll do.  Fuck the dole.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't really know how --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tPurple Haze, Pink Eraser.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou think that could possibly be a full
ttime job?  How many hair colors could
tthere be?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(pissy)
tSomeone's got that job.
tt(excited)
tAgent Orange!  I came up with that one.
tAnyway, there are endless color
tpossibilities and I'd be great at it.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm sure you would.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tMy writing career!  Your hair written by
tClementine Kruczynski.
tt(thought)
tThe Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou sure?  That doesn't sound --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI think.  Anyway, I've tried all their
tcolors.  More than once.  I'm getting too
told for this.  But it keeps me from
thaving to develop an actual personality.
tI apply my personality in a paste.  You?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOh, I doubt that's the case.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWell, you don't know me, so... you don't
tknow, do you?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSorry.  I was just trying to be nice.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYeah, I got it.

There's a silence.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tMy name's Clementine, by the way.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm Joel.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNo jokes about my name?  Oh, you wouldn't
tdo that; you're trying to be nice.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't know any jokes about your name.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tHuckleberry Hound?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't know what that means.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tHuckleberry Hound!  What, are you nuts?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm nut nuts.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(singing)
tOh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my
tdarlin' Clementine?  No?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSorry.  It's a pretty name, though.  It
tmeans "merciful", right?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(impressed)
tYeah.  Although it hardly fits.  I'm a
tvindictive little bitch, truth be told.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSee, I wouldn't think that about you.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(pissy)
tWhy wouldn't you think that about me?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't
tknow.  I was... You seemed nice, so --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNow I'm nice?  Don't you know any other
tadjectives?  There's careless and snotty
tand overbearing and argumentative...
tmumpish.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWell, anyway... Sorry.

They sit in silence for a while.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI just don't think "nice" is a
tparticularly interesting thing to be.

The conductor enters the car.

<b>ttCONDUCTOR
</b>tTickets.

Joel hands the conductor his ticket.  The conductor punches
it and hands it back.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhat is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an
tadjective?  I guess it can be an adverb,
tsort of.

The conductor turns to Clementine.  She fishes in her bag.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tIt doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is
tpandering.  Cowardly.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tAnd life is more interesting than that.
tOr should be.  Jesus God, I hope it is...
tsomeday.
tt(to conductor)
tI know it's here.

The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tI don't need nice.  I don't need myself
tto be it and I don't need anyone else to
tbe it at me.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOkay.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tShit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on.

She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts
frantically through.  Joel sees the book she was reading in
the diner.  It's The Play by Stephen Dixon.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tDamn it.  DAMN IT!
tt(there it is)
tOh.  Here.

She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  He
punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.

<b>ttCONDUCTOR
</b>tNext stop Southampton.

The conductor heads into the next car.  Clementine shoves
stuff back into her purse.  Her hands are a little shaky.
She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,
opens it, and downs it.  Joel is watching all of this but
pretending not to.  She looks out the window for a while.
The train pulls into the station.  The doors open.  Nobody
gets on.  The doors close.  The train pulls out.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tJoel?  It's Joel, right?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYes?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it
tyelling?  I can't really tell.  Whatever,
tI'm a little out of sorts today.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThat's okay.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(stares out window)
tMy embarrassing admission is I really
tlike that you're nice.  Right now,
tanyway.  I can't tell from one moment to
tthe next what I'm going to like.  But
tright now I'm glad you said, "that's
tokay" to me.  That was nice of you.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's no problem.  Anyway, I have some
tstuff I need to --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOh, okay.  Well, sure, I'll just...
tt(stands, throws bag over
tt shoulder)
tTake care, then.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(pulling journal from
tt briefcase)
tProbably see you at the book store.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(heading toward other end of
tt car)
tUnless I get that hair-color-naming job.

Clementine sits and stares out the window.

<b>INT. TRAIN - LATER
</b>
There are a few more people in the car now.  Clementine has
inched a few seats closer to Joel.  She watches him.  His
head is immersed in his journal.

<b>INT. TRAIN - LATER
</b>
It's dark out.  The train is pretty crowded.  Joel stares out
the window.  Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.

<b>EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING
</b>
The doors open and Joel emerges along with others.  He heads
to the parking lot, arrives at the car.  There's a big dented
scrape along the driver's side.  He gets in.

<b>INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Joel drives.  He passes Clementine walking.  She looks cold.
He considers, slows, rolls down his window.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHi.  I could give you a ride if you need.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNo, that's okay.  Thanks, though.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou're sure?  It's cold.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI don't want to take you out of your way.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's okay.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYeah?

He pulls over.  She climbs in.  They drive.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWhere do you live?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou're not a stalker or anything, right?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWell, I probably wouldn't say if I were,
tbut no.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou can't be too careful.  I've been
tstalked.  I've been told I'm highly
tstalkable.  I don't need that.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm not a stalker.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(beat)
tYou know Wilmont?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWilmont.  Near the high school.

Joel turns.  They drive in silence.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tLook, I'm very sorry I came off sort of
tnutso.  I'm not really.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's okay.  I didn't think you were.

There's a silence.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tSo you like bookstores, huh?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI like to read.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tMe too.  It is Rain Dogs, by the way.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah?  I can't remember that album very
twell.  I remember liking it.  But --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tThe song's 9th and Hennepin.  I spent
tmost of the train ride trying to
tremember.  "Till you're full of rag water
tand bitters and blue ruin/And you spill
tout/Over the side to anyone who'll
tlisten."  Remember?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSort of, um...

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tRemember?  "And you take on the dreams of
tthe ones who have slept there/And I'm
tlost in the window/I hide on the
tstairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in
tyour hat..."
tt(starts to cry)
tOh, shit.  I'm so stupid.  Sorry.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWhat?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'm just a bit of a wreck.  "I sleep in
tyour hat" makes me cry.
tt(pointing to a house)
tMe.

Joel pulls over.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tThanks very much.  That was very nice of
tyou.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWell, I wouldn't want to be --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOh, geez, I'm full of shit.  I already
ttold you that.
tt(pause)
tAnyway.  See Ya.

Clementine opens the car door.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tTake care.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(turning back)
tHey, do you want to have a drink?  I have
tlots of drinks.  And I could --

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tUm --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNever mind.  Sorry, that was stupid.  I'm
tembarrassed.  Good night, Joel.

<b>INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>
Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously.  He tries
to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings.  He looks at
the books on her shelves.  Clementine is in the kitchen.  We
see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing
drinks and chatting.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tThanks.  I like it, too.  Been here about
tfour years.  It's really cheap.  My
tdownstairs neighbor is old so she's
tquiet, which is great.  And the
tlandlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but
tgreat, and I have a little porch in the
tback, which is great, because I can read
tthere, and listen to my crickets and...

Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tTwo blue ruins...

Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of
crows flying.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tYou like that?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tVery much.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tThis... someone gave that to me, just
tlike, recently.  I like it, too.  I like
tcrows.  I think I used to be a crow.

She caws and hands Joel a drink.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThanks.  That was good, that crow sound.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tDo you believe in that stuff?
tReincarnation?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't know.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tMe neither.  Oh, there's an inscription
ton the back.
tt(takes it off the wall, reads:)
tThe way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust
tof snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my
theart/A change of mood/And saved some
tpart/Of a day I rued.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tFrost?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(impressed)
tYeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost
tlover by any stretch.  His stuff seems
tstrictly grade school to me.  But this
tmade me cry for some reason.  Maybe
tbecause it is grade school.  Y'know?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's pretty.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI miss grade school.  I don't know why
tI'm calling it grade school all of a
tsudden.  When I went we called it
telementary school.  But I like grade
tschool better.  Sounds like something
tsomeone from the forties would call it.
tI'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore
thats.  Anyway, cheers!

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tCheers.

They click glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp
of her drink.  Joel sips.  She plops down on the couch and
pulls her boots off.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tGod, that feels so fucking good.  Take
tyours off.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm fine.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway.

Joel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishes
her drink.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tReady for another?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo, I'm okay for now.

She heads toward the kitchen with her glass.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWell, I'm ready.  Put some music on.

Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWhat do you want to hear?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (O.S.)
</b>tYou pick it.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou just say.  I'm not really --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (O.S.)
</b>tI don't know!  I can't see them from
there, Joel!  Just pick something good.

Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can
performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.
Clementine reenters with her drink.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tOh, excellent choice.

She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is
dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the
couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tMmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick
tgood.

Joel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence,
which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWell, I should probably get going.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNo, stay.  Just for a little while.
tt(opens her eyes, brightly)
tRefill?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo.  I --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI know a man who needs a refill.

She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the
kitchen.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>tGod bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where
twould I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary,
tand Joseph, maybe I don't want to think
tabout that.

She giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There are
several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade
costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher
potato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel's
drink and a refill for herself.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThanks.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tDrink up, young man.  It'll make the
twhole seduction part less repugnant.

Joel looks a little alarmed.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tI'm just kidding.  C'mon.

She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes.  Joel watches
her, looks at her breasts.  She opens her eyes, smiles
drunkenly at him.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tY'know, I'm sort of psychic.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWell, I go to a psychic and she's always
ttelling me I'm psychic.  She should know.
tDo you believe in that stuff?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't know.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tMe neither.  But sometimes I have
tpremonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe
tthat's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know,
tyou think something and then it happens,
tor you think a word and then someone says
tit?  Y'know?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah, I don't know.  It's hard to know.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tExactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my
tfeeling about it.  It's hard to know.
tLike, okay, but how many times do I think
tsomething and it doesn't happen?  That's
twhat you're saying, right?  You forget
tabout those times.  Right?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah, I guess.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(dreamy beat)
tBut I think I am.  I like to think I am.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tIt's helpful to think there's some order
tto things.  You're kind of closed
tmouthed, aren't you?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSorry.  My life isn't that interesting.
tI go to work.  I go home.  I don't know
twhat to say.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOh.
tt(considers this)
tDoes that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm
talways anxious thinking I'm not living my
tlife to the fullest, y'know?  Taking
tadvantage of every possibility?  Just
tmaking sure that I'm not wasting one
tsecond of the little time I have.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI think about that.

She looks at him really hard for a long moment.  Joel tries
to hold her gaze, but can't.  He looks down at his drink.
Clementine starts to cry again.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled
tat you before about it.  God, I'm an
tidiot.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI do have a tendency to use that word too
tmuch.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI like you.  That's the thing about my
tpsychic thing.  I think that's my
tgreatest psychic power, that I get a
tsense about people.  My problem is I
tnever trust it.  But I get it.  And with
tyou I get that you're a really good guy.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThanks.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tAnd, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I
tcan tell.  There's a lot of stuff going
ton in your brain.  I can tell.  My
tgoal... can I tell you my goal?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(ala Paul Simon)
tWhat's the goal, Joel?
tt(laughs)
tMy goal, Joel, is to just let it flow
tthrough me?  Do you know what I mean?
tIt's like, there's all these emotions and
tideas and they come quick and they change
tand they leave and they come back in a
tdifferent form and I think we're all
ttaught we should be consistent.  Y'know?
tYou love someone -- that's it.  Forever.
tYou choose to do something with your life
t-- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a
tsign of maturity to stick with that and
tsee things through.  And my feeling is
tthat's how you die, because you stop
tlistening to what is true, and what is
ttrue is constantly changing.  You know?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.  I think so.  It's hard to --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tLike I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't
tneed any more reason to do it.  Who knows
twhat bigger cosmic reason might exist?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou're very nice.  God, I have to stop
tsaying that.  You're nervous around me,
thuh?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'm nervous.  You don't need to be
tnervous around me, though.  I like you.
tDo you think I'm repulsively fat?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo, not at all.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI don't either.  I used to.  But I'm
tthrough with that.  Y'know, if I don't
tlove my body, then I'm just lost.  You
tknow?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tWith all the wrinkles and scars and the
tgeneral falling apart that's coming
t'round the bend.
tt(beat)
tSo, I've been seeing this guy...

Joel looks slightly crestfallen.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tt(off his reaction)
tWell, for the last week, anyway!  He's
tkind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but
the's really stuck on me, which is
tflattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And
the's, like, a dope, but he says these
tsmart and moving things sometimes, out of
tnowhere, that just break my heart.  He's
tthe one who gave me that crow photograph.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOh, yeah.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tThat made me cry.  But, anyway, we went
tup to Boston, because I had this urge to
tlie on my back on the Charles River.  It
tgets frozen this time of year.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThat's scary sounding.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tExactly!  I used to do it in college and
tI had this urge to go do it again, so I
tgot Patrick and we drove all night to get
tthere and he was sweet and said nice
tthings to me, but I was really
tdisappointment to be there with him.
tY'know?  And that's where psychic stuff
tcomes in.  Like, it just isn't right with
thim.  Y'know?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI think so.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI don't believe in that soulmate crap
tanymore, but... he says so many great
tthings.  We like the same writers.  This
twriter Stephen Dixon he turned me on to.
tAnd he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel,
tyou should come up to the Charles with me
tsometime.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOkay.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYeah?  Oh, great!

She sits closer to him.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tI'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic --
tnight picnics are different -- and --

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(shy)
tSounds good.  But right now I should go.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(pause)
tYou should stay.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI have to get up early in the morning
ttomorrow, so...

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(beat)
tOkay.

Joel puts on his overcoat.  Clementine heads to the phone
table, pulls out a notepad.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tI would like you to call me.  Would you
tdo that?  I would like that.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYes.

She scribbles her phone number, hands it to him.  He puts it
in his pocket.  He stands there uncomfortably for a moment,
then forces himself to speak.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tI don't think your personality comes out
tof a tube.  I think the hair is just... a
tpretty topping.

She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek.  He's
surprised and pleased and nervous.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tt(shyly formal)
tSo, I enjoyed meeting you.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou'll call me, right?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhen?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tTomorrow?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tTonight.  Just to test out the phone
tlines and all.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOkay.

We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through
the snow and getting in his car.

<b>INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center
neighborhood.  There is no snow on the ground.  He seems
different, somehow foggy and disoriented.

<b>SUBTITLE:  THREE DAYS EARLIER
</b>
He arrives at his apartment building and parks.

<b>EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the
street.  There are two dark figures inside.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tThem.

He hurries inside the building.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the
lights, crosses to look furtively out the window.  It's
snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam
of a streetlight.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt was snowing.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tThere are two of them.  Couldn't make
tthem out.  The orange glow of a
tcigarette.

Joel squints to see inside the van.  Two dark figures talk.
One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily
illuminates the interior.  The figure in the driver seat
rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThe driver waved.  So casual, friendly.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI'm like a joke to them.

Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI guess they figure they can act like
tthey want.  They don't have to worry
tabout me remembering.

He paces, mulling things over.  As he does, the scene starts
to change, almost as if it is drying out.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI might be making a mistake.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tMaybe I'm making a mistake.  Maybe I just
tneed to learn to live with this.  First
tof all, I'll get over it.  Secondly, it
thappened.  Those who do not remember
thistory are condemned to repeat it.  Who
tsaid that?  Churchill?  I'm not sure.
tBut I don't care.  She did it to me.  I
thave to rid myself of this.  Fuck her.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tFuck you, Clementine.

The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague.
Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his
emotional intensity becoming diffused.  Joel does not seem
aware of this.  He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his
pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm.  He looks at it.
It's pink.  There's some illegible initials stamped on it.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tPink.
tt(beat)
tThere was a number on it.  I remember.
<b>tAL 1718?
</b>tt(beat)
tI have to follow through with this.  I
thave no choice.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tThe pill was pink, I remember.  It had
tsome letters and numbers on it.  What
twere they?  AL 1718?  AL something.  Four
tdigits.  I don't like taking pills when I
tdon't know what they are.  I have no
tchoice.

He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his
clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store
packaging.  He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tWe're sorry, the number you have
tdialed...
tt(beat)
tScrew you, Clementine, for doing this ...

<b>ttRECORDED VOICE
</b>tWe're sorry, the number you have dialed
tis no longer in service.  If you think
tyou have reached this recording in error
<b>t-
</b>
<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tBye.

Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed.  By now the
scene is lifeless, almost a husk.  He hears the apartment
building door open.  He hears footsteps.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tIt's them.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tIt's too late.

His eyelids are getting heavy.  He closes his eyes.

<b>BLACK.
</b>
He hears a key in his apartment door.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tFuck.

<b>INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
</b>
Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop.  It's a jarring
transition, visually and emotionally.  Joel is in the midst
of some traumatic state of mind.
He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches
Clementine stack books on shelves.  Her hair is bright orange
now.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI should maybe talk to you.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tClementine.  I should just maybe talk to
ther.

Joel rises and heads toward Clementine.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI love you and if you knew that... if I
ttold you what happened...  I'll explain
teverything, what we meant to each other.
tI'll tell you everything about our time
ttogether.  You'll know everything again
tand...

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tMaybe if I just explain what happened, I
twouldn't have to go through this and I
tcould tell you everything and it would be
tlike you knew and we could rebuild and we
tcould be happy again and...

Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man
approaches Clementine.  Joel stops, watches.  The young man
seems out of breath.  He glances over at Joel, then taps
Clementine on the shoulder.  She turns, annoyed, sees who it
is and her face lights up.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tClementine.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tThat's your look for me.

Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the
ribs.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tI just thought I'd say hi.  I was in the
tneighborhood.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou were not.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tI was not.

Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity.  As he stands there,
the scene starts to dry out.
Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's
turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines.  The
bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tCome over after I'm done here?

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tI can't.  I want to, but I have to study.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou rat.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tI really want to, but tonight's
timportant.  Test tomorrow.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHow could she have done this to me?  How
tcould anyone do this to anyone?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(to Patrick)
tYou didn't say anything about my hair.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tIt's so cool.  You're by far the most
tsensational person in the room.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tIn the room?

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tIn the world.

Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he
realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWhat's happening here?
tt(looks at watch; it's 9:30)
tOh, God!  I have to go home.  They'll be
tthere soon.

Joel turns to leave.

<b>INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Joel drives fast, recklessly.  The intensity is back.  He's
weeping as he drives.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tGotta get home.  How could she do this to
tme?
tHow could she not care about what we
tmeant to each other.  What a fuck!  What
ta fucking monster she is!

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tOh, God.  I miss her.  I can't believe
tshe's with that guy now!  I'm never going
tto see her again.  I love her so much.
tWhat a fucking monster she is!

The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment
building, and gets out of the car.  Joel spots the parked
van.  We've seen this before, but it's dried out now.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThem.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
</b>
Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff.
He's been crying.  He looks behind him and finds himself
looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on
the snowy street.  He turns back to the New York Street and
spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue.

<b>INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Joel sits in the small room with his bags.  A woman across
from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap.  Her
eyes are red from crying.  Mary, the receptionist, pokes her
head through her window into the waiting room.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tHello again, Mr. Barish.  Good, you've
tgot your stuff.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Joel walks with his bags behind Mary.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(not looking back)
tHow are you today?
tt(at lab)
tHere we are.

<b>INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
Joel enters.  Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab
coat.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tAh, Mr. Barish.  This is Stan.  He'll be
tin charge of your procedure tonight.

Stan nods professionally.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tMr. Barish.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHow exactly is this going to work
ttonight?

As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade,
Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry
and monotonous.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tWe'll start with your most recent
tmemories and go backwards -- There is an
temotional core to each of our memories --
tAs we eradicate this core, it starts its
tdegradation process --  By the time you
twake up in the morning, all memories
twe've targeted will have withered and
tdisappeared.  Like a dream upon waking.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIs there any sort of risk of brain
tdamage?

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tWell, technically, the procedure itself
tis brain damage, but on a par with a
tnight of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll
tmiss.

Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment.  Suddenly
he gets it.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's happening now!  I'm already in my
tbrain.

Mierzwiak looks at the fading room.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tYes, I suppose you are.
tt(back in his faded memory
tt persona)
tSo, let's get started -- If we want the
tprocedure underway tonight, we have some
twork to do.

Joel is sitting in a chair.  Electrodes connect him to some
electronic machinery monitored by Stan.  Mierzwiak watches
from the corner.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tWe use the articles you brought to create
ta map of Clementine in your brain.
tTonight while you sleep we'll be able to
ttrace the map and erase.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tBut you're tracing and erasing now.  It's
talready started.  I'm home in my bed.

Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to
Joel.  The equipment registers Joel's reaction.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tVery good.

Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl.  Joel
studies it.  The machines register his response.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tWe'll dispose of these mementos when
twe're done here.  That way you won't be
tconfused later by their unexplainable
tpresence in your home.

Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine
printed on it.  Joel looks at the cup.  The machines record
his reaction.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tGood.  We're getting healthy read-outs.

The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.

<b>ttSTAN'S VOICE
</b>tPatrick, do me a favor --

Joel is watching Stan.  Stan is not speaking, yet his voice
continues.

<b>ttSTAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>t-- and check the voltage levels, I'm not
twiping as clean as I would like here.

Joel looks up.  Stan's voice seems to be coming from above.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  His eyes are closed
and electrodes connect his head to several machines.  The
machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes
and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly.
The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light
blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain.
Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the
lines.  Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the
bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tThe voltage looks fine.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tThen check the connections.

Patrick fiddles with some jacks.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tDoes that help?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tYeah, that looks better.  Thanks.

<b>INT. LAB ROOM - DAY
</b>
The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat.  Stan
pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages.  Mierzwiak smiles.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tAh, your journal.  This will be
tinvaluable.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tt(reading)
tDecember 15th, 2004.  I met someone
ttonight.  Oh, Christ:  I don't know what
tto do.  Her name is Clementine and she's
tamazing.  So alive and spontaneous and
tpassionate and sensitive.  Things with
tNaomi and I have been stagnant for so
tlong.

The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on.

<b>ttSTAN'S VOICE
</b>tI think we got this one.  Let's push on.

Joel looks up at the ceiling.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large
plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with
Clementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some
potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left
there, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of his
loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.

He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:

December 15, 2004   Nothing much happened today.  I stayed
home.  Naomi worked on her dissertation.

The scene is fading as he continues to write.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Joel looks for an office number.  He finds it.  The plaque on
the door reads Lacuna Ltd.  Joel enters.

<b>INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Joel enters the Lacuna waiting room.  Mary sits in the
reception area.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tMay I help you?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tMy name is Joel Barish.  I have an
tappointment.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tPlease have a seat.  Dr. Mierzwiak will
tbe right with you.

<b>INT. OFFICE HALL - DAY
</b>
Mary leads Joel down the hall.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(without turning)
tHow are you today?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNot great.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(at Mierzwiak's office)
tHere we are.

Joel glimpses Mary smiling coquettishly at Mierzwiak.

<b>INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Joel and Mierzwiak are in the sitting area.  Joel looks at
the tape recorder.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tI'm sorry you saw one of our notification
tcards.  You never should have.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWell... I did.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tWe can help you through this.  Why don't
tyou start now by telling me everything
tyou can remember about your relationship
twith Clementine.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(thinks, then:)
tIt was a mess.  I don't know how it got
tthis way...

<b>ttPATRICK'S VOICE
</b>tIt's kind of a dump, don't you think?

Joel looks up, trying to locate the voice.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Patrick is checking out the apartment.  Stan monitors the
equipment.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tt(uninterested)
tIt's an apartment.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tNot a dump, then, but kind of plain.
tUninspired.  And there's a stale smell.
tSort of stuffy.  I don't know.  Stuffy.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tPatrick, let's just get through this.  We
thave a long night ahead of us.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tYeah.

Patrick returns to the bedside, focuses on the machines for a
moment.  He glances at the unconscious Joel.

<b>ttPATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>tSo who do you think is better-looking, me
tor this guy?

Stan glances sideways at Patrick.

<b>INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Mierzwiak sits with Joel in the sitting area.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tSo we'll need you to go home and bring in
teverything you ever received from
tClementine and anything that might remind
tyou of her...

The scene is faded and disappearing fast.  It's gone.

<b>INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Joel gets off the elevator and approaches the receptionist.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSo then she just stops calling.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI wasn't going to call her.  Not after
tthe way she was.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tAny messages, Carmen?

Carmen the receptionist shakes her head.

Next day: Joel approaches the receptionist.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tAny messages for me, Carmen.

<b>ttCARMEN
</b>tNothing, Joel.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tIt's bullshit.  She's punishing me for
tbeing honest with her.

Joel is at his office desk on the phone.

<b>ttPHONE MACHINE VOICE
</b>tYou have no messages.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages.

<b>INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Joel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in
conversation with someone else.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSorry, Carmen.  Any messages?

Carmen shakes her head "no", goes back to her conversation.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel checks his machine: zero messages.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tThat's it.  I'm just gonna--

Without a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER (CONT'D)
</b>tI'm gonna tell her I'm through playing
tgames and --

<b>ttRECORDED VOICE
</b>tThe number you have dialed has been
tdisconnected.

Joel's eyes bug.

<b>INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Joel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWhy would she do that?

<b>ttVAGUE RECORDED VOICE
</b>t-- If you think you have reached this
trecording in error, please check your
tnumber and dial again.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tI don't know, honey.  It's horrible.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tShe's punishing me for being honest.  I
tshould just go to her house.

<b>ttROB
</b>tI don't think you should go there, Joel.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah, I don't want to seem desperate.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tMaybe you need to look at this as a sign
tto move on.  Just make a clean break.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't know.  I'm so... I can't believe
tshe'd be so goddamn immature!

<b>ttROB
</b>tJoel, look, the thing is --

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tt(agitated, interrupting)
tJoel, honey... We have to feed the dog.
tWould you just wait here?  Just a second.

Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and
close the door behind them.  Joel hears a hushed argument
ensue in the hall.  He notices the dog asleep on the floor.
He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it
distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another.  A
subscription card falls to the floor.  He picks it up and is
about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not
a subscription card at all.  It reads:

 Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her
  memory.  Please never mention their relationship to her
tt again.  Thank you.

tt     Lacuna Ltd.
tt     610 11th Avenue, NY, NY

Joel stares at the card, incredulous.

Later: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room.

<b>ttCARRIE (CONT'D)
</b>tYou weren't supposed to see that.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThey can't erase memories.  It's a joke.
tIt's a nasty Clementine hoax.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tSweetie, we called the company.

Joel just stands there.

Close-up of a vague dictionary page.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tLacuna:  Noun.  A blank, a missing
tportion, especially in a manuscript.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel is on the phone pacing.

<b>ttCARRIE'S VOICE
</b>tYou can't tell her, Joel.  They explained
tthat.  Like waking a sleepwalker.  It
tmight have a devastating effect.

<b>INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Joel drives past vague local landmark.

<b>ttCARRIE'S VOICE
</b>tThink about it: to be told you lived an
texistence of which you have no
trecollection.

<b>ttJOEL'S VOICE
</b>tBut what am I supposed to do?

<b>ttCARRIE'S VOICE
</b>tMove on, sweetie.

<b>ttJOEL'S VOICE
</b>tHow can I?  How can I move on when I know
tI'm the only one to carry this love we
thad?  How do I do that?

<b>INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Joel in his parked car next to a fence surrounding a drive-in
movie closed for the season.  He weeps.  The windows fog up
until the outside is completely obscured.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
</b>
Joel looks for an address.

<b>INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
Joel gets off on the sixth floor.  He searches for a room
number.  As he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is
faded, vague and mostly erased.  He keeps walking, comes to
the door marked Lacuna and opens it.  Inside he can see
vague, erased version of Mary the receptionist.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(dead monotone)
tHi, May I help you?

These degraded, faded memories allow Joel to detach himself
and hear what's going on in his bedroom.

<b>ttSTAN'S VOICE
</b>tSo, Mary's coming over tonight.

Joel looks up.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Stan works the joystick.  Patrick sits on the bed with Joel.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tYeah?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tJust wanted to let you know.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tI like Mary.  I like when she comes to
tvisit.  I just don't think she likes me.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tShe likes you okay.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tI wonder if I should invite my girlfriend
tover, too.  I have a girlfriend now.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tYou can if you want.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tDid I tell you I have a new girlfriend?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tt(re: memory on monitor)
tThis one's history.  Moving on...

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tThe thing is ... my situation is a little
tweird.  My girlfriend situation.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tPatrick, we need to focus.

Stan aims the joystick.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel distractedly reads a book, checks the clock, goes back
to the book.  The door opens.  He looks up.  Clementine is
staggering in, drunk.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYo ho ho!

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's three.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tShit.  The last time I saw you.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tAnyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing.  I
tkinda sorta wrecked your car...

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI can't believe you wrecked my car.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou're driving drunk.  It's pathetic.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>t...a little.  I was a little tipsy.
tDon't call me pathetic.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWell it is pathetic.  And fucking
tirresponsible.  You could've killed
tsomebody.

The scene is starting to degrade.  The acting becomes anemic.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tI don't know, maybe you did kill
tsomebody.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOh Christ I didn't kill anybody.  It's
tjust a fucking dent.  You're like some
told lady or something.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tRight!  She called me an old lady here,
ttoo!  And I remember, I said...

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tAnd what are you like?  A wino?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tA wino?  Jesus, Are you from the fifties?
tA wino!
tt(laughs)
tFace it, Joel.  You're freaked out
tbecause I was out late without you, and
tin your little wormy brain, you're trying
tto figure out, did she fuck someone
ttonight?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo, see, Clem, I assume you fucked
tsomeone tonight.  Isn't that how you get
tpeople to like you?

This shuts Clementine up.  She is stung and she starts
gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the
apartment.  Joel is immediately sorry he said this.  He
follows her around.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tI'm sorry.  Okay.  I didn't mean that.  I
tjust... I was just... pissed, I guess.

Clementine is out the door.  Joel follows.

<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping
off in the distance.

<b>INT. JOEL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Joel drives to catch up with Clementine.  He rolls down his
window to talk to her.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tLet me drive you home.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(without turning)
tFuck you, Joel.  Faggot.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tLook at it out here.  It's falling apart.
tI'm erasing you.  And I'm happy.

She keeps clomping.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tYou did it to me.  I can't believe you
tdid this to me.  By morning you'll be
tgone.  Ha!

He stops the car, gets out.

<b>EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of
a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail
there is obscured in darkness.  Joel wanders it.  In the
distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop,
she doesn't get any farther away.  It's lonely.

<b>ttPATRICK'S VOICE
</b>tSee, remember that girl?  The one we did
tlast week?  The one with the potatoes?

Joel looks up, startled.

<b>ttSTAN'S VOICE
</b>tYeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.  Was.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Stan watches the screen.  Patrick paces, fidgets, looks at
the unconscious Joel.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tI gotta tell you something.  I kind of
tfell in love with her last night.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tShe was unconscious, Patrick.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tShe was beautiful.  So sweet and funky
tand voluptuous.  I kind of stole a pair
tof her panties, is what.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tJesus, Patrick!

<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan.

<b>ttPATRICK'S VOICE
</b>tI know.  It's not like... I mean, they
twere clean and all.

<b>ttSTAN'S VOICE
</b>tLook, just don't tell me this stuff.  I
tdon't want to know this shit.

<b>ttPATRICK'S VOICE
</b>tYeah, okay.

<b>ttSTAN'S VOICE
</b>tWe have work to do.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the TV.
It's hard to make out what they're watching.
They sit on opposite ends of the couch.  They look bored.
The scene quickly degenerates.  The room fades.

<b>ttPATRICK'S VOICE
</b>tOkay, but there's more.

Joel listens.

<b>ttPATRICK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>tAfter we did her, I went to where she
tworked and I asked her out.

Joel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch.
She stares straight ahead at the TV.

<b>ttSTAN'S VOICE
</b>tPatrick... do you know how unethical...

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThat must be the guy I saw you with.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tIn the bookstore that night.  The skinny
tguy.

There's a click and Joel finds himself in --

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel watches TV.  Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks
at the TV.  She slips into a skirt.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tHow can you watch this crap?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWhere are you going?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'm fucking crawling out of my skin.

The scene starts to fade.  Clementine puts on her shoes and
heads out the door.

<b>EXT. ZOO - DAY
</b>
Joel and Clementine walk around unhappily.  They barely look
at the animals.  Clementine watches parents with babies.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOh shit.  I remember this.
tt(to Clementine)
tWant to go?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(pissy)
tI want to have a baby.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tLet's talk about it later.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNo.  I want to have a baby.  I have to
thave a baby.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't think we're ready.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou're not ready.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tClementine, do you really think you could
ttake care of a kid?

She turns violently toward him, glaring.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhat?!

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(mumbly)
tI don't want to talk about this here.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tJoel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!

Joel looks around.  People are watching.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tYou can't fucking say something like that
tand say you don't want to talk about it!

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tClem, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(screaming now)
tI'd make a fucking good mother!  I love
tchildren!  I'm creative and smart and I'd
tmake a fucking good mother!

The scene starts to fade.  Clementine's rant continues but
becomes attenuated and vague.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOh, thank God.  It's going.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tIt's you!  It's you who can't commit to
tanything!  You have no idea how lucky you
tare I'm interested in you!  I don't even
tknow why I am!  I should just end it
tright here, Joel.  Leave you in the zoo.
tMaybe you could find a nice sloth to hang
tout with!

She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real
emotion in it.  The scene is a husk.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's going, Clementine.  All the crap and
thurt and disappointment.  It's all being
twiped away.

She looks up at him.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'm glad.

Their eyes lock.  She is fading before his eyes.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tMe, too.

<b>INT. BAR - NIGHT
</b>
It's noisy and crowded.  Joel and Clementine sit at a small
table.  She is drunk and staring off, blankly.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSo, um --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(swiveling head toward him)
tWould you get me another, Joely?

Joel sighs, stands, and heads to the crowded bar.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tThanky!  Thanky!

Joel is at the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention.

Joel is paying the bartender.  He turns with the drink to
head back to the table.  He sees Clementine flirting with a
man in Joel's seat.

Joel is at the table.  Clementine looks from her
conversation.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tJoel, this is Mark.  He likes my boobs.
tHe came over special to tell me that.
tIsn't that nice.  He doesn't think I'm
tfat.

The scene starts to fade.  Mark rises.

<b>ttMARK
</b>tI didn't know she was with someone, man.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tS'okay, Mark.  Joel doesn't like my
tboobs.
tt(stage whisper)
tI don't think he likes girls.

The bar gets quiet and vague.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou're drunk.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou're a whiz kid.  So perceptive, so --

Clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible
words, just a whisper -- like a breeze.

A doorbell buzzes.  Joel looks up.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Patrick opens the door.  Mary stands there in a winter coat,
carrying a backpack.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(coolly)
tOh, hey, Patrick.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tHi, Mary.  How's it going?

She walks past him.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tHey, you.

Stan and Mary kiss.  She looks down at Joel as she takes off
her coat.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tIt's freezing out.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tYou found us okay?

<b>ttMARY
</b>tYeah.
tt(re: Joel)
tPoor guy.
tt(looking around)
tHave anything to drink?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tWe haven't checked.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tWell, allow me to do the honors.  It's
tfucking freezing and I need something.

She heads into the kitchen.  Stan turns back to monitor the
slivers of light.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tMary hates me.  I've never been popular
twith the ladies.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tMaybe if you stopped stealing their
tpanties.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tt(guilty beat)
tOkay, There's more, Stan --

Stan looks over at Patrick.  Mary returns with a bottle of
scotch and two glasses.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tHey, hey.

She pours the whiskey.

<b>ttMARY (CONT'D)
</b>tOh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did
tyou?

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tNah, I don't know.

Mary hands a glass to Stan.  She holds hers up in a toast.

<b>ttMARY

</b>tThat's a good one.

tIt's a good one all right.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tWhat's your bartlett's?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tIt's a quote book.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tI love quotes.  So did Winston Churchill.
tHe actually has a quotation in Bartlett's

</b>tt(trying to engage)
tYeah.  Cool.

<b>ttMARY
</b>t"The quotations when engraved upon the

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tVery cool.  Trippy.

</b>tYup.

tYup.

</b>tDefinitely!

</b>tI think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tDefinitely.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It's dark.  Joel and Clementine are in bed.  The memory is
already in the midst of being erased.  Clementine is talking
in a monotonous, robotic manner.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou don't tell me things, Joel.  I'm an
topen book.  I tell you everything.  Every
tdamn embarrassing thing.  You don't trust
tme.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo, it isn't that.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI want to know you.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI just don't have anything very
tinteresting about my life.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tJoel, you're a liar.

The scene is faded completely now and Joel just lies there
for a moment, registering Clementine's statement.

<b>INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel and Clementine eat dinner in silence.  Joel looks around
at other couples in the restaurant.  Some seem happy and
engaged.  Others seem bored with each other.  He turns back
to his food.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHow's the chicken?

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tIs that like us?  Are we just bored with
teach other?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tGood.

He watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself
another glass.  She holds the wine bottle up to Joel.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tMore?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo.  Thanks.

There's a silence.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tHow's the fish?

The scene is fading.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's good.

They continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves.

<b>ttPATRICK'S VOICE
</b>tHi, Clementine! -- Why, what's wrong? --
tOh, I'm sorry. -- Well, I'm not sure, I
tkind of have to study for my test --

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Patrick is on the phone next to Joel's bed.  Stan watches the
lights on the computer screen.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tHold on.  Let me ask my friend.
tt(covering mouthpiece)
tStan, can I leave for a little while?  My
tgirlfriend is very --

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tPatrick, we're in the middle of --

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tShe's right in the neighborhood.  She's
tupset.

Mary is in the kitchen.  She pokes her head out.  She's got
some pie on a plate.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tLet him go, Stan.  I can help.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tt(sighing, to Patrick)
tGo.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tt(quietly)
tMary hates me.
tt(into phone)
tI'll be right over, Tangerine.

<b>INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Candles are lit.  Joel and Clementine are under a blanket on
the living room rug listening to music.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tJoely...

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah, Tangerine?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tDo you know The Velveteen Rabbit?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tIt's my favorite book.  Since I was a
tkid.  It's about these toys.  There's
tthis part where the skin Horse tells the
trabbit what it means to be real.
tt(crying)
tI can't believe I'm crying already.  He
tsays, "It takes a long time.  That's why
tit doesn't often happen to people who
tbreak easily or have sharp edges, or who
thave to be carefully kept.  Generally by
tthe time you are Real, most of your hair
thas been loved off, and your eyes drop
tout and you get loose in the joints and
tvery shabby.  But these things don't
tmatter at all, because once you are Real
tyou can't be ugly, except to people who
tdon't understand."

She's weeping.  Joel is stroking her hair.  They kiss and
begin to make love under the blanket.  It's sweet and gentle
and then it starts to fade.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(screaming)
tNo!  Jesus, No!

He looks down and Clementine's tear-streaked face is fading.
She continues as if she's still being made love to, even
though Joel is completely beside himself.  He jumps up naked
and yells at the ceiling.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tPlease!  Please!  I've changed my mind!

tt Clementine, then at ceiling)
tI don't want this.  Wake me up!  Stop the

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still.  Mary and
Stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint.  After a silence:

<b>ttMARY
</b>tIt's amazing, isn't it?  Such a gift
tHoward gave the world.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tt(a sigh)
tYeah.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tTo let people begin again.  It's
tbeautiful.  You look at a baby and it's
tso fresh, so clean, so free.  And
tadults... they're like this messy tangle
tof anger and phobias and sadness...
thopelessness.  And Howard just makes it
tgo away.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tYou love him, don't you?

Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught.  She is silent for
a long moment.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tNo.
tt(beat)
tBesides, Howard's married, Stan.  He's a
tvery serious and ethical man.  I'm not
tgoing to tempt him to betray all he
tbelieves in.

Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary.

<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges
through the snow.

<b>INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears.  She's
crying.  He makes his way up her front stairs.  She swings
open the door and hugs him.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tOh, baby, what's going on?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI don't know.  I'm lost.  I'm scared.  I
tfeel like I'm disappearing.  I'm getting
told and nothing makes any sense to me.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tOh, Tangerine.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNothing makes any sense.  Nothing makes
tany sense.

She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tCome up to Boston with me?

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tSure.  We'll go next weekend and --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNow.  Now!  I have to go now.  I have to
tsee the frozen Charles!  Now!  Tonight!

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tUm, okay.  I'll call my study partner.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYay!  It'll be great!  I'll get my shit.

She runs into the bedroom.  Patrick is at the phone and
realizes he doesn't know Joel's number.  After a moment's
thought, he *69's.  The phone rings.

<b>ttJOEL'S VOICE
</b>tHi, it's Joel.  Please leave a message
tafter the beep.

Beep.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tt(whisper)
tStan, it's Patrick.  Pick up.

<b>ttSTAN'S VOICE
</b>tHey, where are you?

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tI got into a situation with the old lady.
tCan you handle things tonight alone?  I'm
treally sorry, man.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Stan is on the phone.  He's really stoned and watches Mary,
stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft
and low on the stereo.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tI can handle it.  He's pretty much on
tauto-pilot anyway.

<b>INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tThanks, Stan.  I owe you.

Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack.  He
pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then
pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the
bedroom door.  The handwriting is a woman's.  He finds what
he's looking for.  He reads:

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>tI took Joel to walk on Charles River with
tme last night.  It was so beautiful and
tcharming.  Joel was nervous about
tstepping onto the ice, but he wanted to

tthat he came out after me.    We lay down
tright in the center and watched the
tstars.  He took my hand and said "I

<b>EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT

Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen
river.  They look up at the stars.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>t...die right now, Clem.  I'm just...
thappy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm
tjust exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.  Her eyes are filled with love
and tears.  Then they get vague.  The scene is being erased.
Joel is panicked.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tClem, no!  This can't keep happening.
tPlease!  Oh, fuck!  Please!

Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed
scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the
beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled
cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her
sleep, them drinking at a bar.  He arrives at a decayed
version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tWe can help you through this.  Why don't

tyou can remember about --

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou have to stop this!

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tWhat?  What do you mean?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm trapped in my head and everything I

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tYes, but... I'm just something you're

</b>
Patrick reads the journal.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>t... and we made love right on the ice.
tIt was absolutely freezing on my ass!  It
twas wonderful.

Clementine enters, dressed for the cold.  Patrick puts the
notebook away.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'm so excited.  Yay!

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tI'm excited, too.  Oh, and I wanted to
tgive you this.  It's a little... thing.

Patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her.

<b>ttPATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>tI didn't have a chance to wrap it.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tIt's gorgeous.
tt(slipping it on)
tJust my taste.  I've never  gone out with

tThanks.  So let's get going.  Long drive.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan and Mary have sex on the floor next to Joel's bed.

<b>EXT. FOREST - DAY
</b>
Joel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tSuch a beautiful view.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(looking at her)
tYes indeed.
tt(snapping out of memory)
tFuck!  They're erasing you, Clem!

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOh?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI hired them to.  We're in my brain.  But

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWow.  Um, well... can't you just force
tyourself awake?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't know.

He concentrates.  Nothing happens.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tAaargh!  It's horrible!  I'm trapped!

He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his
feet, screaming.  But even while he's doing this the memory
and Clementine are fading around him.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
It's raining out.  Joel is reading, slouched in a chair.  He
looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her
underwear.  She's reading, too.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tShe's so sexy.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI loved you on this day.  I love this
tmemory.  The rain.  Us just hanging.

Clementine looks over at him, smiles.  Her brow furrows in
thought.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhat if you hide me?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWhat do you mean?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(formulating)
tWell... if they're looking for me in
tmemories I'm in, what if you take me to a
tmemory I'm not in?
tt(proud)
tAnd we can hide there till morning.

Joel ponders this.  The scene and Clementine are beginning to
dissolve.  Joel grabs Clementine's hand.  She giggles with
glee.  He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWhere?  Where?  Where?

He drags her through the landscape of already decayed
memories and turns off into:

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
The kitchen is dated and vague.  Joel and Clementine are in
an oversized playpen; they're adults but small.  Joel wears
footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them.  He
holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll.  Clementine is
still in her panties and bra.  An oversized woman in high
heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth
preparing dinner.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tJesus.  What's this?

Joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI must be about two.
tt(oddly)
tI want my mommy.  She's busy.  She's not
tlooking at me.
tt(back to himself, re: doll)
tLook, my Huckleberry Hound doll!  I told
tyou about this!
tt(beat)
tI want my mommy!

He starts to cry.  Clementine tries to comfort him.  She hugs
him.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tt(crying still)
tI want my mommy.
tt(adult, to Clementine)
tI don't want to lose you, Clem.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'm right here.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm scared.  I want my mommy.  I don't
twant to lose you.  I don't want to
tlose...

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tJoel, Joely, look... it's not fading.
tThe memory.  I think we're hidden.

Joel sucks in some snot.  His mother scurries back and forth
clanging pots.  The room is not decaying.  Joel smiles.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Stan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering
after sex.  Stan suddenly perks up.  He looks at the monitor.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tIt's stopped.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tWhat?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tListen, it's not erasing.

He makes his way, naked, to the computer screen.

<b>ttSTAN (CONT'D)
</b>tIt's not erasing.  He's off the screen.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tWhere?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tI don't know.  He's not on the map.

Stan tries to break through his marijuana haze.  He fiddles
nervously with the equipment.

</b>tI don't know what to do!  I don't know

tWe have to do something.  He can't wake
tup half done.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tShit!

He jerks the joystick spastically.  Mary, also naked, gets up
and looks over his shoulder at the screen.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(definitely)
tWe should call Howard.

Stan turns and looks at her.  He's stoned and trying to
understand her motivation.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tNo way.  I can handle this.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tThis guy's only half cooked.  There's no
ttime to fuck around, Stan.

Stan tries to think.  He paces.  Mary watches him.  Finally:

<b>ttSTAN

tOkay.

He dials the phone, waits.

<b>ttSTAN (CONT'D)
</b>tHello, Howard?

<b>INT. MIERZWIAK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tStan?  What's going on?

<b>ttSTAN'S VOICE
</b>tThe guy we're doing?  He's disappeared

Stan hangs up the phone, looks at Mary.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tHe's coming?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tYou better go.

</b>tHell no.

She starts getting dressed.

<b>ttMARY (CONT'D)
</b>tShit, I'm so stoned.  I don't want him to

She hurries into the bathroom with her bag.

</b>tGod, I look like shit!  God!

Mary slams the bathroom door.  Stan puts his head in his
hands.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel and Clementine are in the playpen.  Joel's oversized
mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the
head.

<b>ttMOTHER
</b>tHow's my baby boy?

She's gone.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI really want her to pick me up.  It's

</b>tYou remember what happened next?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI came over to the bed and you smelled so
tgood, like you just woke up, slightly
tsweaty.  And I climbed on the bed with
tyou and you said something like --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>t-- another rainy day.  Whatever shall we
tdo?

He laughs.  She unbuttons his pajamas.  They begin to make
love.  Joel's mother hurries around the kitchen.  Joel stops,
looks at Clementine.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThere's this guy!

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhat?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThere's this guy.  I heard him talking in
tmy apartment.  He's one of the eraser

tnext day as if he were a stranger and now
tyou're dating him.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE

She's crying and holding Patrick's hand.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhat's wrong with me?

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tNothing is wrong with you.  You're the
tmost wonderful person I've ever met.

She glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even
harder.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Stan works on trying to get the signal back.  His hair is
combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but
still stoned.  Mary is pacing nervously to and from the
window, looking out into the night.  She's dressed also, and
she's wearing more make-up now.  Her hair is pulled up into
some sort of style.  Suddenly she freezes at the window.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tThere he is.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Do
tI look okay?

She doesn't say anything.

<b>ttMARY (CONT'D)
</b>tI'm still stoned.  Are you?  Crap.

She looks in the mirror.

<b>ttMARY (CONT'D)
</b>tt(to Joel)
tYour Visine didn't do shit, fella.

The doorbell buzzes.  Mary lunges for the door, then calms
herself before opening it.  Mierzwiak, holding an equipment
bag, looks surprised.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tMary.  What are you doing here?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tShe came to help, Howard.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tI wanted to learn as much about the
tprocedure as possible, Howard.  I think
tit's important for my job...to help
tcomfort the clientele.  You know.

Mierzwiak looks from Mary to Stan, nods, and enters.  Mary
closes the door.  Mierzwiak crosses to the equipment.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tLet's get to the bottom of this.  Shall
twe?

He sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
</b>tOdd.

He fiddles some more.  Mary looks on, fascinated.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tI tried that already.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tDid you try going through C-Gate?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tYeah.  Of course.

Mierzwiak ponders.  He unzips his equipment bag, pulls out
another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tI'm going to do a Spectrum search
tthroughout his memory, see if anything
tcomes up.

Mierzwiak presses some more buttons.  The program starts up.
A much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this
screen.  It rotates.  Eventually Mierzwiak sees a small
distant light in the brain.  He zeroes in on it.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
</b>tOkay, here it is.  I don't know why it's
toff the map like that, but --

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized
mother.  Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing.
The mother doesn't seem to see her.

tI love getting bathed in the sink.  It's
tsuch a feeling of security.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(giggling)
tI've never seen you happier.

The elements of the scene flash explosively away:  Joel's
mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the
kitchen, Clementine.   Joel is thrown into:

<b>INT. CAR - NIGHT

He sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in
movie theater.  The movie on the giant screen is partially
obscured by a fence.  Joel and Clementine drink wine.

Mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tOkay, we're back in.

tLike a surgeon or a concert pianist.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tWell, thank you, Mary.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tt(sighing)
tYou get some sleep, Howard.  I'll take it
tfrom here.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tYeah, probably a good idea.

<b>INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Clementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what
the characters on the screen are saying.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tBut can't you see... I love you, Antoine.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tDon't call me Antoine.  My name is Wally.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYes, but I can't love a man named Wally.

She starts to fade.  The scene starts to fade.  Joel
remembers their previous plan.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThey found us before.  The plan didn't
twork.  I don't know what to do now.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(mouthing to woman on screen)
tHide me somewhere deeper?  Somewhere
tburied?

Joel grabs her.  They run off just as the scene decays into a
husk behind them.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Stan is back at the controls.  Mierzwiak's at the door with
Mary.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tHoward, they've disappeared again.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tOh dear.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tI'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired.

He nods, distractedly.  She smiles to herself as he heads
back to the equipment.

<b>EXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON
</b>
Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed
accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school
building toward the bike rack.  Clementine is with him,
dressed as she was in the parked car.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tLook at you, cutey!  What are we doing?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThis kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the
tshit out of me.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI'm terrified.  I thought if I hung
taround the art room long enough, he'd go
thome and I could get my bike.

They head toward the bike rack.  Joel's is the only bike
remaining.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tPoor Joel.

They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including
giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner.

<b>ttJOE EARLY
</b>tHi, Jill.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHe calls me Jill.  Everyone calls me Jill
tafter this.

The other kids laughs.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tJust shut up, Joe.  I'm going home.

<b>ttJOE EARLY
</b>tI don't think so.  We're fighting.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't want to fight you.

The kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight..."  Joe Early
throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side.  joel falls
and stays down, covering himself.

<b>ttJOE EARLY
</b>tC'mon, Jill.  Get up, faggot.  C'mon.

Joel doesn't say anything.  He peeks humiliated at
Clementine.  She's watching him.  She's got a tear in her
eye.  She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm too scared to even throw a punch.
tWhen I tell people this story I leave
tthat part out.

The scene flashes violently to white and is gone.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Mierzwiak is at the machine.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tWe got him back.  Stan, I think I'm just
tgoing to have to get through this
tmanually.  We're running late.

<b>EXT. BEACH - DAY
</b>
It's cold.  Joel and Clementine walk, all bundled up.  She
points at a house up the beach.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOur house!  Our house!

She runs ahead, laughing.  The scene is decaying.  Joel
chases after her.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tClem, c'mon, we've got to hide you.
tRemember?

He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in:

<b>INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It's dark.  Joel, junior high school size, is in bed
masturbating.  Clementine is in there, too, in her winter
coat, still laughing from before.  She realizes what's going
on.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(mock offended)
tJoel!

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(continuing to masturbate)
tI don't like it either, but I'm just
ttrying to find horrible secret place to --

Joel's mother pops her head in the door.

<b>ttMOTHER
</b>tJoel, I was just --
tt(sees what's going on)
tOh.  Um... I'll ask you in the morning,
thoney.  Have a good night.

The mother backs out, closes the door.  Joel cringes.
Clementine laughs, still in the mode of the memory she was
swiped from.  Flash!  It's all gone.

<b>INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel and Clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle
on a slice of cheesecake in front of her.  Joel hands her a
small wrapped box.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHappy Birthday.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(unwrapping the gift)
tThanks, Joely.  A present!  Oh boy!

She pulls out the bracelet.  It's the same bracelet Patrick
gave her.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tOh, Joel.  It's beautiful!
tt(slip it on)
tI mean, you're the first guy who ever
tbought me a piece of jewelry I could
thonestly say that about.

He notices she's starting to fade.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI scoured the city for it.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI love it!

She leans across the table to kiss him.  He grabs her and
runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night.

<b>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
</b>
Joel is one of a group of five year olds.  He holds a hammer
and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon.  The other
boys are goading him.

<b>ttBOYS
</b>tC'mon, Joel, you have to.  Do it already.

Joel doesn't want to.  Clementine watches.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI can't.  I have to go home.  I'll do it
tlater.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI didn't want to do this.  But I had to
tor they would've called me a girl.

Joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer.
Red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom.  The
kids hoot.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI can't believe I did that.  I'm so
tashamed.

A live bird watches from a tree.  Clementine, still dressed
for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls
Joel away from the other boys.  The two of them walk down
Joel's suburban street.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tIt's okay.  You were a little kid.
tt(beat)
tThis is a great birthday present.
tGetting to see you as a boy.

She kisses him and they walk holding hands.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(pointing)
tThat's where I live.  Lived.

Joel looks down at her hand.  It's fading.  The bracelet is
gone.  Clementine is gone.  His childhood house is gone.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Mierzwiak works the equipment.  He has located a small area
of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tI'm getting the hang of it.  I still
tunderstand it.  But I'm finding him
tquickly enough.  I'm hopeful there won't
tbe too much peripheral eradication.

Mary sits on the bed.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(a little giggly)
tI like watching you work.

Stan sighs, grabs his coat.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tI'll go out for a smoke.  If no one
tminds.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tt(not looking up)
tThat's fine, Stan.

Mary doesn't say anything.  Stan huffs and is out the door.
Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light.  Mary
gets up her courage to speak.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tDo you like quotes, Howard?

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tHow do you mean?

<b>ttMARY
</b>tOh, um, like famous quotes.  I find
treading them inspirational to me.  And in
tmy reading I've come across some I
tthought you might like, too.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tOh.  Well, I'd love to hear some.

Mary is thrilled, beside herself.  She tries to calm down.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tOkay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed
tare the forgetful, for they get the
tbetter even of their blunders."

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tIs that Nietzsche?

<b>ttMARY
</b>tYeah, yeah it is, Howard.  And here I was
tthinking I could tell you something you
tdidn't know.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tIt's a good quote, Mary.  I'm glad we
tboth know it.

He smiles at her.  She's flustered, flattered.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(sputtering)
tThere's another one I like, I read.  It's
tby Pope Alexander.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tAlexander Pope?

<b>ttMARY
</b>tYes, shit.  Oops, sorry!
tt(puts hand over mouth)
tSorry.  It's just I told myself I wasn't
tgoing to say Pope Alexander and sound
tlike a dope and then I go ahead and do
tit.  Like I psyched myself out.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tIt's no big deal.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tYou are such a sweetheart.

There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air.
Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it.

<b>ttMARY (CONT'D)
</b>tAnyway, the quote goes "How happy is the
tblameless Vestal's lot!  The world
tforgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal
tsunshine of the spotless mind!  Each
tprayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".

She smiles, proud and embarrassed.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tThat's lovely.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tReally?  I thought it was appropriate
tmaybe.  That's all.
tt(beat, then quickly)
tI really admire the work that you do.  I
tknow it's not proper to be so familiar
tbut I guess since we're outside the
tworkplace I feel a certain liberty to --

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tIt's fine, Mary.  I'm happy to hear it.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tOkay.  Good.  Great.  Thanks.
tt(blurting)
tI like you, Howard... an awful lot.  Is
tthat terrible?

Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his
unflappable self.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tYou're a wonderful girl, Mary.

She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tI've loved you for a very long time.  I'm
tsorry!  I shouldn't have said that.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tI've got a wife, Mary.  Kids.  You know
tthat.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(suddenly weepy)
tI wish I was your wife.  I wish I had
tyour kids.

Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug.  It turns into kiss.  He
pulls away.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tWe can't do this.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tNo you're right.  Once again.  You're a
tdecent man, Howard.

He smiles sadly at her.  She smiles courageously at him.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tI want you to know it's not because I'm
tnot interested.  If that means anything.

They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back
to locating and eradicating blips of lights.

<b>EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette.  He has an
unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window.  He watches
Mierzwiak and Mary.  They're talking as Howard works.  It
appears to be a very serious discussion.  A car pulls up
outside.  Stan turns to see.  A middle-aged woman gets out,
checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only
lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside.  Mierzwiak's
resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again.
This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and
falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel.  The
woman in the window is transfixed.  As Mierzwiak fumbles to
unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window.
He practically shrieks and jumps up.

<b>EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</b>
Joel and Clementine walking, hand-in-hand, look up
simultaneously.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Mary looks confusedly at Howard.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tWhat?

She follows his eyes and sees the woman in the window, who
turns and walks off in a huff.

<b>ttMARY (CONT'D)
</b>tOh my God!

Mierzwiak is already in his coat.  He's out the door.

<b>EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The woman is at her car.  Stan watches from the van.
Mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tHollis!  Hollis!

<b>ttHOLLIS (THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)
</b>tI knew it, Howard.  I don't even know why
tI bothered to copy the damn address.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tIt didn't start out to be this.  I came
there to work.  It's a one-time mistake.

Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now.  Hollis is in her car.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(heroically)
tMrs. Mierzwiak, it's true.  And it's not
tMr. Mierzwiak's fault.  I'm a stupid
tlittle girl with a stupid little crush.
tI basically forced him into it.  I swear.

Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak.

<b>ttHOLLIS
</b>tDon't be a monster, Howard.  Tell the
tgirl.

Stan is out of the van now, listening.  Mary shivers in the
cold, hugs herself.  There's a long silence.  Then:

<b>ttMARY
</b>tTell me what?

Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes.  Mary looks back and
forth between them.  Hollis starts her car.

<b>ttHOLLIS
</b>tPoor kid.  You can have him.  You did.

She drives off.  Mary watches Howard with increased
foreboding.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tWhat, Howard?

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tWe... have a history.  I'm sorry.  You
twanted the procedure.  You wanted it
tdone... to get past.  I have to finish in
tthere.  It's almost morning.  We'll talk
tlater.

He shuffles inside.  Mary stands there, unable to digest
this, struggling in vain to remember.  Stan watches.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tLet me take you home.

Mary shakes her head "no."  She walks off, dazed.

<b>EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT
</b>
Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river
and look up at the night sky.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tI could die right now, Clem.  I'm just
thappy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm
tjust exactly where I want to be.

Clementine looks over at him.  Their eyes meet.  She sobs.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI want to go home.

She hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and
continues, now running.

<b>INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NIGHT
</b>
Mary, in shock, sits in the empty fluorescent car.  She tries
to look out the window but can only see her own reflection.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It's deathly silent as Mierzwiak and Stan work on completing
the job.  Mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the
map of Joel's brain.  He targets it.

<b>EXT. ROWBOAT - DAY
</b>
Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his
oversized father.  Clementine is naked and in the boat, too.
She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI love this book, Joel.  Thank you so
tmuch for telling me about it.

Joel is his father.  The father is drunk and sullen.  He
faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake.

<b>ttFATHER
</b>tDon't be like me, son.  Don't waste your
tlife.  You'll come to a point someday
twhere it'll be too late.  You'll be sewn
tinto your fate...

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt was horrifying, seeing my father like
tthat.
tThere was no hope for me if his life was
tsuch a failure.  And he saw failure in
tme, too, written in my future.

Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tJoel, you're not sewn in.  He's wrong.

<b>ttFATHER
</b>t...and there'll be nowhere to go except
twhere you're headed, like a train on a
ttrack.  Inevitable, unalterable.

The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light.

<b>INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across
from Clementine.  He is ragged and jarred.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm done, Clem.  I'm just going to ride
tit out.  Hiding is clearly not working.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYeah.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI want to enjoy my little time left with
tyou.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tThis is our first "date" date.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tDo you remember what we talked about?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNaomi, I guess.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhat was I wearing?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tGod, I should know.  Your hair was red.
tI remember it matched the wallpaper.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tEgad, were you horrified?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo!  I think you were wearing that black
tdress, y'know, with the buttons.

She is wearing the black dress.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNo, you were with me when I bought that.
tAt that place on East 6th.  It was later.

<b>INT. DRESS SHOP - SHOP
</b>
The scene has already been erased.  It's just a decayed husk.
A vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress.

<b>INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
Clementine wears a generic black dress now.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tRight.  Something black though.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'll buy that.  Black's always good.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWe did talk about Naomi.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI said: Are you sure?  You seem unsure.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm sure, I said.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tBut you weren't.  I could tell.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI was so nervous.  I remember I couldn't
tthink of anything to say.  There were
tlong silences.

There is a long silence.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tI thought I was foolish.  I thought I'd
tmistaken infatuation for love.  You said:

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tSo what.  Infatuation is good, too.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tAnd I didn't have an argument.

<b>INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Joel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI dropped you off after.  You said --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(Mae West)
tCome up and see me... now.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's very late.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYes, exactly.  Exactly my point.

<b>INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThis was our first time.

The scene starts to fade.  Joel watches Clementine disappear.

<b>INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT
</b>
Mary enters the dark room, frazzled.  She flips on the
fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one
with her name on it.  Her jaw drops.  With a shaky hand, she
puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses "play."

<b>ttMIERZWIAK VOICE
</b>tOkay, so just tell me what you remember.
tAnd we'll take it from there.

<b>ttMARY'S VOICE
</b>tt(shaky)
tUm, I liked you immediately.  At the job

tand mature.  And I loved that you were
thelping all these people.  You didn't
tcome on to me at all.  I liked that.  I
twas tongue-tied around you at first.  I
twanted you to think I was smart.  You
twere so nice.  I loved the way you
tsmelled.  I couldn't wait to come to
twork.  I had these fantasies of us being
tmarried and having kids and just...
tt(starts to cry)
t...and so... then... when...
tthat one day, when I thought you looked
tat me back... like... Oh, Howie, I can't
tdo this?  How can I do this?

<b>ttMIERZWIAK VOICE
</b>tIt's what's best, Mary.  You know that.

Mary slumps to the floor.  We move into her eyes.

<b>ttMARY'S VOICE
</b>tYeah, I know.  Oh, God.  Okay, well, I
twas so excited...

<b>A SERIES OF MURKY IMAGES.  NO DETAIL.
</b>
A flirtatious look from Mierzwiak.

<b>ttMARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>t...Remember you bought me that little
twind-up frog?

A vague shot of a wind-up frog.

<b>ttMARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>tAnd you said...

A vague shot of Mierzwiak mouthing to Mary's voice.

<b>ttMARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>t"This is for your desk.  Just a little
ttoken"

Back to Mary sitting on the floor, listening to the tape.

<b>ttMARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>tI knew then... I knew something was going
tto happen... something wonderful.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel sits in the quiet living room.  The scene is fading.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNaomi.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tOn the couch.  Dark.  Quiet.  I wondered
tif I had made a terrible mistake.  I
talmost reached for the phone about a
tthousand times.  I thought I could take
tit back, erase it, explain I had
tmomentarily lost my mind. Then I told
tmyself we weren't happy.  That was the
ttruth.  That what we were was safe.
tIt was unfair to you and to me to stay in
ta relationship for that reason.  I
tthought about Clementine and the spark
twhen I was with her, but then I thought
twhat you and I had was real and adult and
ttherefore significant even if it wasn't
tmuch fun.   But I wanted fun.  I saw
tother people having fun and I wanted it.
tThen I thought fun is a lie, that no one
tis really having fun; I'm being suckered
tby advertising and movie bullshit... then
tI thought maybe not, maybe not.  And then
tI thought, as I always do at this point
tin my argument, about dying.

<b>INT. ROOM - DAY
</b>
An elderly man sits.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI projected myself to the end of my life
tin some vague rendition of my old man
tself.  I imagined looking back with a
ttremendous hole of regret in my heart.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel sits.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI didn't pick up the phone to call you,
tNaomi.  I didn't pick up the phone.

The scene dissolves.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Namoi is red-eyed from crying.  She is packing things in
boxes.  Joel paces, steals glances at her, doesn't know what
to say.  She holds up a book.  The scene starts to fade.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tYours?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou take it.  I don't know.

She tosses it in a box.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tNaomi, I really value our relationship.

ttouch.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tDon't do this to me now, Joel.  Really.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Joel watches out the window as Naomi stuffs a final box in
the trunk of a car.  There's another woman down there with
her.  They get into the car and drive off.

<b>INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
</b>
Joel talks to Clementine.  The scene is fogging over.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI told her today I need to end it.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tIs that what you want?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI did it.  I guess that means something.

Clementine shrugs.  The scene fades.

Joel walks with Naomi.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tSo what's going on, Joel?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't know, I've just been thinking,

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tWhat?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tY'know, we've been, I don't know, sort

</b>tDon't say "we" when you mean "you."

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI think maybe, we're both so used to

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tBullshit.  Who is it?  You met someone.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo.  I just need some space, maybe.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tThe thing is, Joel, whatever it is you
tthink you have with this chick, once the
tthrill wears off, you're just going to be
tJoel with the same fucking problems.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's not somebody else.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI hate myself.

Naomi walks off.  Joel watches her.  The scene fades.

<b>INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
</b>
Joel enters, looks around.  There's no sign of Clementine.
Joel approaches a male employee.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIs there a Clementine who works here?

<b>ttMALE EMPLOYEE #1
</b>tt(calling to another male
tt employee)
tMark, is Clem on tonight?

<b>ttMALE EMPLOYEE #2
</b>tOn my dick, bro.
tt(turns, sese Joel, embarrassed)
tOh, hey.  Yeah, I think she's upstairs in
tPhilosophy.

Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHi.

She turns.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI didn't think you'd show your face
taround me again.  I figured you were
thumiliated.  You did run away, after all.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSorry to track you down like this.  I'm
tnot a stalker.  But I needed to see you.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(seemingly uninterested)
tYeah?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'd like to... take you out or something.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWell, you're married.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNot yet.  Not married.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tLook, man, I'm telling you right off the
tbat, I'm high maintenance.  So I'm not
tgoing to tiptoe around your marriage or
twhatever it is you got going there.  If
tyou want to be with me, you're with me.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOkay.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tSo make your domestic decisions and maybe
twe'll talk again.

She goes back to stacking.  Joel stands there helplessly.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI just think that you have some kind
tof... quality that seems really important
tto me.

The scene is disintegrating.  Clementine's speech is
delivered without passion.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tJoel, I'm not a concept.  I want you to
tjust keep that in your head.  Too many
tguys think I'm a concept or I complete
tthem or I'm going to make them alive, but
tI'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking
tfor my own peace of mind.  Don't assign
tme yours.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI remember that speech really well.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(smiling)
tI had you pegged, didn't I?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou had the whole human race pegged.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tProbably.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI still thought you were going to save
tme.  Even after that.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI know.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt would be different, if we could just
tgive it another go around.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tRemember me.  Try your best.  Maybe we
tcan.

The scene is gone.

<b>INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Joel sits forlornly in the back seat.  Rob drives and Carrie
sits in the front passenger seat.  The car stops in front of
Joel's apartment building.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThanks, guys.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tI hope you feel better, sweetie.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tSay hi to Naomi.

The car door closes.

<b>INT. BUILDING STAIRWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Joel climbs the stairs.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI hope she's not up.  I need to think.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The lights are off.  Joel sits on a chair near the window,
writing in his journal.  The streetlight illuminates the
paper.  Naomi sleeps in the bed.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI met someone tonight at a party on the
tbeach.  Her name is Clementine.  There is
tsomething alive about her.

Naomi turns over in bed, sees Joel.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tt(full of sleep)
tHi.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHi.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tHow was it?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou didn't miss much.  Rob Carrie say
thello.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tHi, Rob and Carrie.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tGo back to sleep.

The room is starting to decompose.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tYeah.  Come to bed.  I'm cold.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIn a minute.

Naomi turns over.  Joel goes back to his writing.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tt(more and more emotionless)
tI don't know what to do about this.  I've
tbeen feeling so alienated and numb
tlately.  Forever.  The thought of not
tacknowledging my feelings again seems
tself-destructive.
tHow can I continue on this path toward a
tliving death, a life filled with
tobligation and guilt and responsibility
tbut joyless, hopeless?  I need to speak
twith Clementine.

The scene has turned to a husk.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
</b>
Joel is at his closet, putting on a sweater.  Naomi is at the
dining room table, papers spread out before her, writing.
Joel turns and watches her for a moment.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSo you don't mind?

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tI've got to finish this chapter anyway.

The scene is fading.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOkay.  I wish you could come.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tThis is it.  The night we met.  My God,
tit's over.

<b>ttNAOMI (CONT'D)
</b>tMe, too.

He approaches Naomi, kisses her on the top of the head.  She
continues to write.

<b>ttNAOMI (CONT'D)
</b>tSay hi to Rob and Carrie.  Have some fun!

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI hope you get your work done.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tt(sighing)
tYeah.

<b>INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Rob drives.  Carrie fiddles with the radio dial in the front
passenger seat.  Joel sits in the back.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tI'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it.  You
tokay?  You seem quiet.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tJust a little overworked, maybe.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tThe trip to the party where I met
tClementine.  My first memory of her is
tnow my last memory of her.

Joel looks out the window.  Carrie turns around and says
something to Joel.  She is backlit, her hair a halo of frizz.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI remember you turned around.  Your face
twas dark and your hair was backlit -- I
tcould see a halo of frizz -- you asked me
tif things were okay between Naomi and me.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tI did.  You said, things were fine.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI remember.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tThis is the night you met Clementine,
tJoel.  I remember watching you walk down
tthe beach with her and I thought, oh
tshit.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah, you told me that later.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tI told you that later.

Joel looks out he window.  He sees the husk of a memory on
the darkened roadside.  It's Joel and Carrie in:

<b>INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Faded.  Carrie and Joel sit at the table with coffee.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tWho was the girl you walked off with?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNo one.

<b>EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a
small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot.

<b>EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</b>
Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tIs this the right way?

<b>EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire
down the beach.  People and music can be heard.

<b>EXT. BEACH - LATER
</b>
Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his
lap.  People warm themselves at the fire.  Joel watches
couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou were down by the surf.  I could just
tmake you out in the dark.

Joel looks down to the water.  There's Clementine, in her
orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tYour back to me.  In that orange
tsweatshirt I would come to know so well
tand even hate eventually.  At the time I
tthought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI remember being drawn to you even then.
tI thought, I love this woman because
tshe's alone down there looking out at the
tblack ocean.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tBut I went back to my food.  The next
tthing I remember, I felt someone sitting
tnext to me and I saw the orange sleeve
tout of the corner of my eye.

A shot of the orange sleeve.  Joel looks up.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tHi there.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHi.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI was so nervous.  What were you doing
tthere, I wondered.  Your hair was lime
tgreen.  Green revolution.

A shot of her green hair.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou said...

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI saw you sitting over here.  By
tyourself.  I thought, thank God, someone
tnormal, who doesn't know how interact at
tthese things either.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.  I don't ever know what to say.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI can't tell you how happy I am to hear
tthat.  I mean, I don't mean I'm happy
tyou're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm
tsuch a loser.  Every time I come to a
tparty I tell myself I'm going to be
tdifferent and it's always exactly the
tsame and then I hate myself after for
tbeing such a clod.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tEven then I didn't believe you entirely.
tI thought how could you be talking to me
tif you couldn't talk to people?

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tBut I thought, I don't know, I thought it
twas cool that you were sensitive enough
tto know what I was feeling and that you
twere attracted to it.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tBut, I don't know, maybe we're the normal
tones, y'know?  I mean, what kind of
tpeople do well at this stuff?

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tAnd I just liked you so much.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tYou did?  You liked me?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou know what I did.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYeah, I know.  I'm fishing.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou said --

She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'm Clementine.  Can I borrow a piece of
tyour chicken?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tAnd you picked it out of my plate before
tI could answer and it felt so intimate
tlike we were already lovers.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tI remember --

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tThe grease on your chin in the bonfire
tlight.

Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOh God, how horrid.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm Joel.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tNo, it was lovely.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tHi, Joel.  So no jokes about my name?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou mean, like...
tt(singing)
tOh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my
tdarlin', Clementine... ?  Huckleberry
tHound?  That sort of thing?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYeah, like that.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNope.  No jokes.  My favorite thing when
tI was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound
tdoll.  I think your name is magic.

She smiles.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(eyes welling)
tThis is it, Joel.  It's gonna be gone
tsoon.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI know.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhat do we do?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tEnjoy it.  Say good-bye.

She nods.

Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tSo you're still on the Zoloft?

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tNext thing I remember we were walking
tdown near the surf.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNo, I stopped.  I didn't want to feel
tlike I was being artificially modulated.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI know what you mean.  That's why I
tstopped.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tBut my sleeping is really fucked up.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't think I've slept in a year.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYou should try Xanax.  I mean, it's a
tchemical and all, but it works... and it
tworks just having it around, knowing that
tit's there.  Like insurance.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tyeah?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'll give you a couple.  See what you
tthink.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOkay.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tHave you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI love her.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tReally?  Me, too!  I don't meet people
twho even know who she is and I work in a
tbook store.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI think she's great.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tMe too.  There's this poem --

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tDid this conversation come before or
tafter we saw the house?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI think, before.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSeems too coincidental that way.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYeah, maybe.

Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for
the winter.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tDo you know her poem that starts "Seaside
tgusts of wind,/And a house in which we
tdon't live...

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah, yeah.  It goes "Perhaps there is
tsomeone in this world to whom I could
tsend all these lines"?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYes!  I love that poem.  It breaks my
theart.  I'm so excited you know it.
tt(pointing to houses)
tLook, houses in which we don't live.

Joel chuckles appreciatively.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tI wish we did.  You married?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tUm, no.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tLet's move into this neighborhood.

Clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house.  Joel
is nervous.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI do sort of live with somebody though.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOh.

She walks to the next house, tries the door.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tMale or female?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tFemale.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tAt least I haven't been barking up the
twrong tree.

She finds a window that's unlatched.  She lifts it.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tCool.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWhat are you doing?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tIt's freezing out here.

She scrambles in the window.  Joel looks around, panicked.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(whisper)
tClementine.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI couldn't believe you did that.  I was
tparalyzed with fear.

The front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tC'mon, man.  The water's fine.  Nobody's
tcoming here tonight, believe me.  This
tplace is closed up.  Electricity's off.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI hesitated for what seemed like forever.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI could see you wanted to come in, Joel.

He walks cautiously toward the door.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tAs soon as you walked in.  I knew I had
tyou.  You knew I knew that, right?

<b>INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Joel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door
behind him.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI knew.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI knew by your nervousness that Naomi
twasn't the kind of girl who forced you to
tcriminally trespass.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's dark.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tYeah.  What's your girlfriend's name?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tNaomi.

She's searching through drawers for something.  She pulls out
a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tAh-ha!  Now I can look for candles,
tmatches, and the liquor cabinet.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI think we should go.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tNo, it's our house!  Just tonight --
tt(looking at envelope on
tt counter)
t-- we're David and Ruth Laskin.  Which
tone do you want to be?  I prefer to be
tRuth but I'm flexible.
tt(opens cabinet)
tAlcohol!  You make drinks.  I'm going
tfind the bedroom and slip into something
tmore Ruth.  I'm ruthless at the moment.

She runs upstairs, giggling.  The room is drying out, turning
into a husk.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(calling after her)
tI really should go.  I really need to
tcatch my ride.

<b>ttVOICE-OVER
</b>tI didn't want to go.  I was too nervous.
tI thought, maybe you were a nut.  But you
twere exciting.  You called from upstairs.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tt(flat)
tSo go.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI did.  I walked out the door.  I felt
tlike I was a scared little kid.  I
tthought you knew that about me.  I ran
tback to the bonfire, trying to outrun my
thumiliation.  You said, "so go" with such
tdisdain.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tt(poking her head downstairs)
tWhat if you stay this time?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI walked out the door.  There's no more
tmemory.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tCome back and make up a good-bye at
tleast.  Let's pretend we had one.

Clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her
way through the decaying environment.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tBye, Joel.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI love you.

She smiles.  They kiss.  It fades.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b><b>tI --
</b>
<b>EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</b>
Joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire.  This scene,
too, is disintegrating.  It dries up and Joel is just
standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen
in the distance like a photograph.

<b>INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Joel sits in the back seat, Rob and Carrie are in the front.

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tDid you have fun?

Joel nods glumly.

Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel
studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse
outside the moving car window.  He sees dried-out version of
previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops.
He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the
beach with Rob and Carrie.  It, too, is decaying.  Soon all
has crumbled into dust.  Everything goes black.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Howard watches the monitor.  The last specks of light are
fading.  It grows dark.  He is tired, his eyes are hollow.
He turns to Stan, who is staring out the window at the dawn.

<b>ttHOWARD
</b>tOkay.

Stan turns and wordlessly begins the clean-up.  He pulls the
electrodes off of Joel's scalp, coils cable, packs bags.
Howard dials the bedside phone.  He waits as it rings.

<b>ttHOLLIS'S VOICE
</b>tHi, you've reached the Mierzwiaks.  We

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tThanks, Stan.  Thanks.

<b>INT. PATRICK'S CAR - EARLY MORNING

Patrick and Mary are heading home from Boston.  Mary is
silent and depressed.  Patrick tries to break the silence.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tYou want to stop for coffee or something?

Mary shakes her head "no."  Long silence.

<b>ttPATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>tWell, it was sure beautiful on that

Mary doesn't say anything.  Silence.

<b>ttPATRICK (CONT'D)

tDo you swear you didn't know?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tI swear.

</b>tOnce, maybe.

She watches him closely, waiting for him to continue.

</b>tI really like you, Mary.  You know that.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tDo you remember anything else?  What I

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tt(thinking)
tYou were in red.  That red sweater with
tthe little flowers, I think.  You were
tleaning against his car.
tt(thinking)
tHe looked a little like a kid.  Kind of
tgoofy and wide-eyed.  I'd never seen him
tlook like that before.  Happy.  You
tlooked beautiful.  You looked in love.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tt(heading toward the levator)
tThanks, Stan.

She stops but doesn't turn to face him.

<b>ttMARY (CONT'D)
</b>tYou're nice.

He nods.  She waves, heads to the elevator.

squeezes on with all the other commuters.

</b>tYou made me have an abortion.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tIt was a mutual decision.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tYou made me have you erased!  I loved
tyou.  I love you!  How could you --

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tI didn't make you.  You thought it best.
tt(off her stare)
tBut, look, I take full responsibility.

She looks at him for a long while.  Then, out of frustration,
she screams.

<b>INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel sits across from Naomi.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tt(oddly cautious)
tSo... you haven't been involved with
tanyone in all this time?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's been a pretty lonely couple of
tyears.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tI'm sorry.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWell, it was my fault -- the break-up.
tI'm sorry.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tOh, sweetie.  It really does cut both
tways.  We were taking each other for
tgranted and --

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI miss you.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tMiss you, too.
tt(awkward pause)
tI have been seeing someone for a little
twhile.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(trying for enthusiasm)
tOh!  Great.  That's great!

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tA religion instructor at Columbia.  A

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm sorry.  I really shouldn't have --

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tI'm glad you called.

<b>INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Joel and Naomi are in bed having sex.  There are certain
sexual routines, habits, they have fallen back into almost
immediately.  She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way
that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to
him.  They finish and lie there.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSo you think the dissertation will get
tpublished?

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tI don;t know.  I'm not sure there's a big
tpublic demand for books on Calvinism and
tMisogyny.

<b>INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Clementine lies in bed with Patrick.

<b>EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING
</b>
The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is
among them.
The platform across the tracks from them is empty.  Suddenly,
Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He climbs
the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the
empty platform.  An almost empty train pulls into that
platform.  Joel gets on the train and watches the business
commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of
the station.

<b>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>
Mary gets out of bed.  She has been crying all night.  She's
a wreck.  She puts on some coffee then crosses into the
living room area.  Sitting there are piles of the files from
work.  She pulls the top one out, copies the name and address
onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in.  She
pulls another file out.  This one has Joel's name on it.  She
copies it onto an envelope.

<b>INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel says goodbye to Clementine.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tSo you'll call me, right?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhen?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tTomorrow?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tTonight.  Just to test out the phone
tlines.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah.

Joel exits.  We stay on Clementine as she watches Joel head
to his car, tromping through the snow.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Joel enters, drops his overcoat on a chair, dials the phone.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHi, Naomi, it's Joel.

<b>ttNAOMI'S VOICE
</b>tHi.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHow's it going?

<b>ttNAOMI'S VOICE
</b>tGood.  I called you at work today.  They
tsaid you were home sick.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI know.  I had to take the day to think.

<b>ttNAOMI'S VOICE
</b>tYeah, I tried you at home.  Did you get
tmy message?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI just got in.

<b>ttNAOMI'S VOICE
</b>tLong day thinking.

Joel flips on messages with volume down.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah, I suppose so.

<b>ttNAOMI ON MACHINE
</b>tt(cheerful)
tHi.  They told me you were sick!  So...
tWhere are you?!  I had a really nice time
tlast night.  Just wanted to say hi, so...
thi.  Call me.  I'm home.  Call me!

<b>ttNAOMI'S VOICE
</b>tThat's me.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThere you are.
tt(pause)
tNaomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall
tback into this fast without considering
tthe problems we had...

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tOkay, Joel.  I suppose you're right.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI had a good time last night.  I really
tdid.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>tSo I'm going to get some sleep.  I'm glad
tyou're okay.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tWe'll speak soon.

<b>ttNAOMI
</b>t'Night.

She hangs up and Joel stands there for a minute feeling
creepy, then he dials the number on a piece of paper.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>tWhat took you so long?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI just walked in.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>tHmmm.  Do you miss me?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tOddly enough, I do.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>tHa Ha!  You said, I do.  I guess that
tmeans we're married.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI guess so.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>tTomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.

<b>EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT
</b>
Clementine steps out onto it.  Joel follows nervously.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tDon't worry.  It's really solid this time
tof year.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't know.

She takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence.

<b>ttJOEL (CONT'D)
</b>tThis is so beautiful.

She squeezes his hand.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tIsn't it?

She runs and slides on the ice.  Joel is by himself now.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't know.  What if it breaks?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWhat if?

Clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars.  Joel
is paralyzed.  He looks back at the shore.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI think I should go back.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tJoel, come here.  Please.

He hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her.  She
reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down.  He lies on
his back beside her, their bodies touching.  He wants to turn
to her, but out of shyness, doesn't.  She holds his hand.
They look up at the stars.  She smiles, doesn't say anything
and snuggles closer to him.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tListen, did you want to make love?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tMake love?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tHave sex.  Y'know --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tOh, um...

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tBecause I just am not drunk enough or
tstoned enough to make that happen right
tnow.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tThat's okay.  I --

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm sorry.  I just wanted to say that.
tThis seems like the perfect romantic
texotic place to do it and --

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tHey, Joel --

<b>ttJOEL
</b>t-- and I'm just too nervous around you
tright now.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tI'm nervous, too.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYeah?  I wouldn't have thought that.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWell, you obviously don't know me.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI'm nervous because I have and enormous
tcrush on you.

She smiles up at the sky.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tShow me which constellations you know.

<b>MONTAGE
</b>
We see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila
envelopes.  One by one they open the envelopes and pull out
tapes.  We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as
people listen to their tapes.

<b>EXT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Joel drops Clementine off.  She kisses him.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>
Joel enters with his mail.  He opens a manila envelope, reads
the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo,
listens.  Joel dials the phone.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>tYeah?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tDid you send this?  Is it a joke?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>tI probably got the same thing as you.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI mean, I haven't even told anyone I've
tmet you.  Who would even know to do this?

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>tt(matter of fact)
tMaybe it's true then.  It's my voice on
tthe tape.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThat's what you have to say?  How could
tit be true?  I never even heard of any
tprocedure like this.  It's a joke.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tMaybe.  Call someone who'd know.

<b>MONTAGE
</b>
We see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone.
We hear over and over:  "Is this true?", "Did this really
happen?", "Do I know you?", "Is it true?"

<b>INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Carrie is on the phone.  She pauses nervously, then speaks:

<b>ttCARRIE
</b>tYes, Joel.  It is true.  We weren't
tsupposed to say anything.  They say it's
tlike waking a sleepwalker.

<b>INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Joel hangs up.  He dials the phone.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tIt's true.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>tI know.  I spoke to my friend Magda.

Joel is immersed in the several page document.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tLook, I have to go.  I have to think.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE
</b>tJoel, we've fucked.  We've made love.
tLike a million times.  And we were so
tsweet and shy and inept with each other
tlast night.  Isn't that lovely?

Joel doesn't know what to say as this registers.  He just
stands there dumbly.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>tCome over here, sweetheart.  Please.

<b>INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
Joel and Clementine review their separate Lacuna packages
together.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tSays you were closed off, non
tcommunicative, never told me what you
twere feeling.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSays you were a bully...

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tt(laughing)
tA bully?  Moi?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tThat's what it says.  You drank too much,
tyou picked on me for being passive and
ttimid.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWell, sounds like me.  Sorry, man.
tt(reading)
tSays you were jealous and suspicious.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSays you would sometimes disappear all
tnight, then brag to me about your sexual
tconquests.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tDid I use the term "sexual conquests" or
tis that your way of putting it.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tI don't know.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tDoesn't sound like me.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tSays you were a slob, leaving trails of
tpanties and dirty socks in your wake.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tSays you were constantly calling me a
tslob.
tt(laughs)
tIt's sexy that we were like a married
tcouple, griping and overly-familiar and
tbored.  Don't you think?

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tt(considering)
tI sort of do.  But I only see it as a
tfantasy version of reality.  Cleaned up
tenough to be erotic.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE
</b>tWe should have sex.  It's old hat for us.

She smiles at nervous Joel.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tYou know my body like the back of your
thand.

She unbuttons her blouse.

<b>ttCLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
</b>tEvery curve, every freckle.

She takes off her shirt.  He stares at her.  He has clearly
never seen this body before.

<b>ttJOEL
</b>tYou're so beautiful.

She approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her
waist for the first time.

<b>INT. LACUNA LTD. WAITING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Stan enters the waiting room, now crowded with people holding
their files, a stunned-looking lot.  There is a new woman in
the reception window.  The file cases behind her are bare.

<b>ttRECEPTIONIST
</b>tMay I help you?

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tI work here.  I used to work here.  Stan.
tPlease just tell Howard I'm here to clean

tHe says he needs to see you.

<b>INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

<b>ttMIERZWIAK

<b>ttSTAN

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tMary has stolen our files and is sending
tthem back to people.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tJesus.

Mierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor
looking in on the lab, where Patrick has clearly taken over
Stan's position.  He is in the process of interviewing a sad
young woman.

<b>ttYOUNG WOMAN
</b>t... so I called everybody I know and
tasked them to tell me everything.  Now I
tknow my entire history with him, but it's
tin the form of a story, I'm losing my

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tThis is why people must never be told.
tIt's like waking a --

<b>ttYOUNG WOMAN
</b>tI don't know what to do.  Before I
tthought I was depressed for no reason.
tNow it's like I've been assigned a
treason.

<b>ttPATRICK
</b>tThis never should've happened, ma'am.
tWe'll take care of it.

<b>ttMIERZWIAK
</b>tI know you don't like me much, Stan, but

<b>ttJOEL

<b>ttMARY
</b>tWhat do you want, Stan?

<b>ttSTAN

<b>ttMARY
</b>tNothing.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tI know what it is.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tI don't know.  I just -- there are a lot

<b>ttMARY
</b>tThey have a right to know.  Howard is a

tt(suddenly weeping)
tI can't remember my baby!  I can't
tremember my baby.  It existed and I can't
teven remember.  Do you understand that?

Stan doesn't know what to say.  He stands there dumbly.  Mary
slumps into a ball on a chair.

<b>ttSTAN
</b>tMary, people come to him voluntarily.

<b>ttMARY
</b>tI won't allow it.  Those who cannot
tremember the past are condemned to repeat

Long pause, then:

tI don't want to hurt people.

tBut these things happened!  All these

The old woman is staring off blankly, her giant manuscript in
her lap, as she travels over the New York skyline.  We move
into her eyes.

<b>INT. VAGUE SPACE
</b>
Vague reenactments of memories intermingle in this undefined
space:

The young girl being raped by the man in the car.

A soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered
friends.

A couple fighting, from the woman's point of view.

<b>ttMAN

behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the

</b>tYou don't have to jump down my throat.  I

<b>ttOLD WOMAN (MARY)
</b>tWell, don't try.  It's unbecoming on you.

Old Howard mutters something and disappears into the back.
Old Mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc,
places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and
listens, somewhat wearily but attentively.  We watch the
color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording.
Another old woman enters the office.  Old Mary looks up,
seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.

<b>ttOLD WOMAN (MARY) (CONT'D)

tPlease have a seat.

He indicates a sitting area.  She sits.  He joins her.

<b>ttOLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
</b>tWould you mind if I tape our discussion?

She shakes her hear.  He punches a couple of buttons on his
computer console.  A tape recorder starts up and his computer
screen lights up so only he can see it.  On it we see a whole
file on Clementine Kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of
previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them
involving Joel Barish.

<b>ttOLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)

The old Clementine is unconscious on her bed, hooked up to
