</b>t                     This film is short.
<b>t
</b>t                     This film is fast.
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tFADE IN:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  MANHATTAN - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tThe whole island, from the south.  For a second.  Literally.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tCloser, just the skyline.  For another second.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tCloser still, the Upper West Side.  For another second.  No
ttime to waste admiring the scenery.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  WEST 83RD STREET - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tRace across a field of PEDESTRIANS to pick up three women
thurrying down the sidewalk.  LYDIA LYNCH, a real estate
tbroker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a
tstride.  MEG ALTMAN, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with
ther, she's tall, wafer-thin, pale as a ghost.  SARAH, a nine
tyear old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a
tbasketball as she goes.  The kid's athletic, much tougher
tthan Meg, who she resembles.
<b>t
</b>tLydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          -- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five
t          feet deep, forty-two hundred square
t          feet, four floors with a rentable
t          basement apartment, so five
t          altogether, courtyard in back --
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Could you slow down a little?
t               (looking back over her
t                shoulder)
t          Or we could wait for the car...
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          No cars.  Feet are faster.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          How many more do we have after this?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          None, there's nothing else, you know
t          how tight the market is.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          This is it?  I told you on the
t          phone, I have to be moved in in two
t          weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce
t          that here.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b>t          Mom, it's the sidewalk.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          Oh, that miserable little prick is
t          already leaving.
<b>t
</b>tThey approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story
ttownhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or
tmore.  EVAN, a sour-looking man, has just locked the front
tdoor of number 26 and is coming down the steps.  He sees them
tcoming.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          One day you will learn to respect
t          other people's time, Lydia, one day
t          you --
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          Evan, I am so sorry, you were a
t          saint to wait for us!
<b>t
</b><b>t                                                  CUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tEvan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of
tthe townhouse.  The place is completely empty.  He talks
tfast, races through the tour.  The three of them come in,
tSarah still bouncing her basketball.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          This is the middle of the house, the
t          entry floor, living room's over
t          there.  The kitchen floor's below us
t          and there's two bedroom floors
t          above.
<b>t
</b>tThe front door closes behind them, with a THUD so
tauthoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out.  Meg
ttries to get her daughter's attention, to tell her to stop
tbouncing the ball in the house.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          It's an enormous amount of space for
t          the money and I'll be perfectly
t          honest, the family is in no hurry
t          whatsoever.
<b>t
</b>tMeg whispers Sarah's name, but Sarah still ignores her, goes
ton bouncing the ball.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          I don't have to tell you there is an
t          acute shortage of living space in
t          Manhattan right now and this is a
t          highly unique property.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          No ball, kid.
<b>t
</b>tSarah immediately stops bouncing.  She wanders into the
tliving room, peers through the big French doors, which look
tout over the courtyard area.  There's another row of
tbrownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to
tone another.  It looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city.
<b>t
</b>tSarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the
twindow.  There is a profound melancholy about her.  Meg
twatches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection.
tCan't.
<b>t
</b>tEvan flings open the door of an old-fashioned cage-style
televator.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine,
t          the previous owner, was disabled the
t          last ten years of his life.  Highly
t          unusual, the elevator, you will not
t          find this in ninety percent of
t          brownstones.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Will they take asking price?  I need
t          a two week escrow and I'm already
t          approved for the loan.
<b>t
</b>tLydia turns, gives Meg an "are you insane?" look.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          What say we see the house before we
t          dicker, hmm?
t               (starting up the stairs)
t          I have to warn you, this is exactly
t          the response we expected to get.
t          It's a very emotional property.
<b>t
</b>tAs he disappears upstairs, Lydia turns to Meg, lowers her
tvoice.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          Who taught you to negotiate?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b>t          It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't
t          have to pay the price on the tag.
<b>t
</b>tShe gets in the elevator and RATTLES the door shut with a
tbang.  That kid's got an attitude.  Meg takes a deep breath,
tturns to Lydia.  She brushes her hair behind an ear, we
tnotice her thin hand is shaking.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          I'm sorry.  Apartments, and...
t          money, and... this is more my
t          husband's area.
<b>t
</b>tShe digs in her purse for a prescription pill bottle and some
twater.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Was.  His area.  I'm not very good
t          at...
<b>t
</b>tLydia watches as she swallows a pill, waiting for Meg to
tfinish her sentence.  Not very good at what?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Things, and if I can't prove to my
t          soon to-be ex-husband that I can
t          provide a suitable place for our
t          daughter to live in the next
t          fourteen days, it's going to get
t          ugly between us.  Uglier.
<b>t
</b>tLydia just looks at her, no idea what to say.  These two are
tfrom different places.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN (O.S.)
</b>t               (from upstairs)
t          It would be so lovely if I could
t          shot the property before I leave!
<b>t
</b><b>t                                                  CUT TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  TOP FLOOR BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tEvan, Lydia, and Meg poke their heads in a series of rooms,
tone after the other, the tour flying by quickly.  First, an
tupstairs bedroom.  Nice, roomy, looks out on the courtyard.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          Top floor.  Two bedrooms, one
t          bathroom.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  DEN - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tAnother floor, another empty room.  The trio passes through.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
t          what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used
t          it as an office.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t               (low voice, to Meg)
t          He's talking about Bernard
t          Pearlstine.
<b>t
</b>tMeg shrugs, who's that?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t               (moving, through a
t                bathroom)
t          Master bath.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          The hotel guy?  It's been in the
t          papers lately.  His kids are all
t          suing each other over his estate.
t          He was a total recluse, paranoid,
t          rich as hell, he was worth thirty
t          million or something, now it turns
t          out they can't find half of it.
t               (singsong)
t          Somebody took something didn't
t          belong to them!
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          I hardly see how family gossip is
t          germane to showing the property.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t               (low, to Meg)
t          Stop calling it the property, you
t          sound ridiculous.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t               (through a closet)
t          Master closet.
<b>t
</b>tFrom the hallway, there is a GROANING METALLIC sound, the
televator, and the happy laughter of the little girl as she
tputs it through its paces.  Evan winces, speaks as if his
tmouth hurts when he moves it.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          Could the child please stop that?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b><b>t          KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
</b><b>t
</b>tShe looks at Meg and winks.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          And we emerge in the master bedroom.
<b>t
</b>tHe checks his watch.
<b>t
</b>tMeg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room.  She
tlooks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next
tdoor.  She looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the
twindow wall.  She takes two steps back from it.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Something's weird.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          What?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          I don't know, doesn't that corner
t          seem funny to you?
<b>t
</b>tShe points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to
tthe closet.  There is a mirrored door that leads to the
tcloset, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look
tclosely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly
ttoward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which
tthe corner of the room appears much closer to the door than
tit is.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          I was waiting to see if you'd
t          notice!  On caravan, no one from our
t          office had the slightest idea.
<b>t
</b>tHe pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall.  It makes a
tfaint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He
tpulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty
tdegrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the
tclosed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look
tclosely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall.
<b>t
</b>tMeg looks at him -- what in the world?  Even pushes again,
ttwice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and
tthe smooth wall CLICKS ajar.  He pulls it wide open.  Meg and
tLydia step forward, fascinated.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tFrom the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we
tsee the three of them standing in the open doorway,
tsilhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom
twindows behind them.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          It's called a panic room.
<b>t
</b>tHe hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          A what?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A
t          castle keep, in medieval times.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          Oh, I've seen these...
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          It's quite in vogue in high end
t          construction right now.  One really
t          can't be too careful about home
t          invasion.
<b>t
</b>tThe other two walk inside, but Meg lingers near the door,
tlooking around, studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies
t-- water, food packs, batteries, flashlights, tools, rope,
tclothes, blankets -- you get the idea.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          Hey, this is perfect for you...
t               (Meg scoffs)
t          Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're
t          living alone now.  Your alarm goes
t          off, or you head glass break, or for
t          whatever reason you think someone's
t          broken into your home in the middle
t          of the night.  What are you going to
t          do?  Call the police and wait until
t          they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse
t          downstairs in your sexy little
t          underthings and check it out?  I
t          think not!
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried
t          phone line, completely separate, not
t          connected to the house's main line
t          and never exposed throughout the
t          house's infrastructure or outside
t          the house -- you can call the
t          police; nobody can cut you off.
t          Your own ventilation system,
t          complete with oxygen scrubber, so
t          you've got plenty of fresh air for
t          as long as you like.  And a bank of
t          video monitors --
<b>t
</b>tHe hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors,
trevealing a dozen different views of the house.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          -- covering almost every corner of
t          the house.
<b>t
</b>tMeg nods, starting to sweat.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Makes me nervous.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          Why?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Ever read any Poe?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          I don't think so, but I love her
t          album.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          No, Edgar Allen.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t               (thinks)
t          The furniture guy?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t               (giving up)
t          What's to keep them from prying open
t          the door?
<b>t
</b>tEvan reaches past Meg and pushes a red button on the wall
tbehind her.  With a sudden WHANG of steel, a heavy metal door
tleaps out of a slot in the wall and SLAMS shut, like a
tsubmarine hatch.  A series of metal latches CLICK into place
tinside it, from top to bottom, securing it into place.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          Steel, four inches thick.
<b>t
</b>tMeg takes a step back.  They're now enclosed in the room.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          Everything's spring-loaded, even if
t          the power's out it's fully
t          functional.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Open it.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with
t          this room, did he?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Open the door.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     LYDIA
</b>t          And with kids like he's got, no
t          wonder he wanted a place to hide.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     EVAN
</b>t          That's highly inappropriate.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          I said open the door.
<b>t
</b>tEvan hits a green button and the door GROANS slowly open,
trecoiling its massive spring, and revealing Sarah, the little
tgirl, standing in the entryway, grinning widely.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b>t          My room.  Definitely my room.
<b>t
</b>tShe bolts in, just as her mother bolts out.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

tthe house.  Whatever she pushed turned these on too, probably
tnot what she meant to do, but at least she got the alarm on
tfor the night.
<b>t
</b>tThe door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom
thangs open.  In the middle of the floor in here, somebody has
tmade a small tent of blankets and couch cushions.  Sarah must
thave been playing here before bed.
<b>t

<b>t

<b>t
</b>tShe gets in bed, her side, the left side.
<b>t

ther.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>t-- 2:26.  Meg is in a hard, boozy sleep.  We drift out the
tdoor of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and
tdown the open stairwell.  We glide through the entry floor,
tstill gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping
teven further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the
tground floor.
<b>t
</b>tWe drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the
tcanyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on
tthe street.
<b>t
</b>tWe move right up against the window, peer through the glass
tjust as --
<b>t
</b>t-- a van pulls up across the street and stops.  Can't see
tthrough its windows.  No movement for a moment, then the
tdriver's door opens and a MAN climbs out.  He wears dark
tclothes.
<b>t
</b>tThe Man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across
tthe street towards us.  He's carrying a bag of some kind.
<b>t
</b>tHe goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob.
tWe hear a key slide into the door, rattle.
<b>t
</b>tBut the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in
tagain, jiggles.  Still won't open the door.
<b>t
</b>tThe Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window,
twhich is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us.
tCan't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there.
<b>t
</b>tHe turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up,
tonto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't
ttell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for
tsomething.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE.
<b>t
</b>tThe fire escape.
<b>t
</b>tThe Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of
tvision.
<b>t
</b>tWe turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.  We
tstart back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in
tthe kitchen, toward the stairwell.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tBack in the stairwell, the exact reverse of the shot we saw
tearlier.  We're drifting up, off the kitchen floor, through
tthe entry floor, and as we rise we notice something all the
tway up on the roof that we couldn't see before, when we were
tlooking down.
<b>t
</b>tA skylight.  We continue to rise, drawn toward it.  We move
tup, through the master bedroom floor, creeping up alongside
tthe stair banister, now reaching the top floor of the house,
tand just as we near the skylight --
<b>t
</b>t-- a figure appears, visible through it.  The Man in dark
tclothes, on the roof now.  He stops, peers down through the
tskylight, looking at us without seeing us again.
<b>t
</b>tHe steps across the skylight.  This is not the way he intends
tto enter.  We drift again, following his soft footsteps on
tthe roof, which we can hear faintly through the ceiling.
<b>t
</b>tHere in the hall, just outside Sarah's bedroom, a closet door
tis ajar.  We squeeze through the gap and into the closet.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE CLOSET,
</b><b>t
</b>tit's completely dark.  Can't see a thing.  But then a sliver
tof light appears, coming from above.  We look up.
<b>t
</b>tThere is a ladder that's bolted to the wall in this closet,
tit leads up to a square panel in the ceiling.
<b>t
</b>tRoof access.  And that roof access panel is moving, ever so
tslightly, moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting.
tA shiny silver something slides through the crack along the
tedges of the portal.
<b>t
</b>tIt slithers along the edge of the hatchway, searching for
tsomething.  It finds a small round nub in the crack.  The
tsilver something stops.  It HUMS with electricity for a
tmoment, then there is a bright spark and a soft CRACK.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t

<b>t
</b><b>tZONE 19 DISABLED
</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  CLOSET - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the closet, the silver something withdraws and the roof
taccess panel is removed.  A million stars are visible in the
tnight sky above.  But we're inside.
<b>t
</b>tAnd in a moment, so is this intruder.  The Man peers down,
tthrough the open hatchway, then slips through the opening and
tclimbs silently down the ladder.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn bed, Meg stirs.  An alcohol sleep is a restless one, and
tshe's suffering.
<b>t
</b>tShe sits up groggily, chugs a glass of water.  Lies down
tagain.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tOne floor up, the Man steps into the hallway and starts for
tthe stairs, moving quickly and confidently.  Knows where he's
tgoing, knows what he wants.  He starts down the stairs,
thappens to glance to the side as he does so.
<b>t
</b>tHe freezes.  He's looking in the open doorway of the top
tfloor bathroom, staring hard at something that clearly
tdisturbs him.
<b>t
</b>tA nightlight.  Plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the
tbathroom.  (For the record, it's the Power Puff Girls.)  The
tMan climbs the stairs again, concerned, goes to the door of
tthe bathroom.  He looks from the nightlight to the
tcountertop.
<b>t
</b>tThere's a moving box on the countertop.  His eyes widen.
tThis is news to him, bad news.
<b>t
</b>tHe takes a step back and a breath.  He turns, looks to the
tend of the hall.  His eyes now adjusted to the darkness, he
tnotices something he didn't see before, something coming from
tunder the door to the fourth floor bedroom.
<b>t
</b>tLight.  From inside.  From another nightlight.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the top floor bedroom, a nightlight burns in another
toutlet.  Nearby, Sarah is asleep in bed, the covers kicked
toff.
<b>t
</b>tThe door to Sarah's bedroom glides open, terribly slowly.
tThe Man stands in the doorway, staring, aghast, at the
tmountain of moving boxes piled in the room.  His gaze falls
ton Sarah in the bed.
<b>t
</b>tThe Man just stares, beside himself.  His lips mouth a word,
tsoundlessly.  Doesn't take a lip reader to guess it.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the master bedroom, Meg flops over in bed, facing away
tfrom the doorway, really having a rough go of it.  She slept
ttoo hard before, now she's awake, her head is killing her,
tshe's really paying the price of four glasses of wine.
<b>t
</b>tShe lies still, on her side, facing us.
<b>t
</b>tBehind her, the bedroom door moves, silently.
<b>t
</b>tOpening.
<b>t
</b>tThe Man stands there, one finger still on the door he's just
tpushed open.  He stares at the sleeping form of Meg on the
tbed, whose back is to him.  He has no idea she's awake.
<b>t
</b>tMeg lies in bed, eyes wide open, no idea a Man is standing in
tthe doorway to her bedroom.
<b>t
</b>tNoiselessly, the Man moves away, down the hall.  The moment
this head disappears down the stairwell --
<b>t
</b>t-- Meg flops over again, facing the doorway.  She closes her
teyes, gives sleep another try.
<b>t
</b><b>t                                                  CUT TO:

</b><b>tINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tThe Man walks across the kitchen, shaking his head in
texasperation at the packing boxes all around him.  He goes to
tthe front window, peers outside.  He reaches for a light
tswitch on his right.
<b>t
</b>tThrough the window, we can see the stoop light go on.  Then
toff, then on and off again.
<b>t
</b>tStill through the window, we see the side panel door of the
tvan slide open.
<b>t
</b>tTWO MORE MEN climb out.  They are also dressed in dark
tclothes.  They also carry satchels.
<b>t
</b>tThey walks calmly across the street, grow large in the window
tas they approach us.  The first intruder (who has a name,
tit's BURNHAM) steps over to the kitchen door, runs his
tsilvery strip through the gap.  Another HUM and spark.

trise up over the top of his slouching head; when he walks it
tlooks like gravity does all the work, just pulling him
tforward.  JUNIOR is much smaller, very high-strung, dresses
tlike a homey, very street, but can't hide the fact that the
tstreet is Park Avenue.

<b>t

this belt.
<b>t

<b>t

</b><b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg sits up in bed.  She's bleary, her head feels like
tsomeone rested a manhole cover on it.  She gets up, in the
tdark, and staggers off toward the bathroom door, feeling her
tway with her arms, her eyes not adjusted to the dark.
<b>t
</b>tShe steps through the door.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tShe walks into the bathroom and feels around for a light
tswitch, but can't find it.  She blinks, squints, tries to get
ther bearings.  The only light is a harsh white glow that
tcomes from along one wall, from a bank of tiny video
tmonitors.
<b>t
</b>tShe finds the light switch, flicks it on, it nearly blinds
ther.  She's not in the bathroom.  She's wandered into the
tpanic room by mistake.
<b>t
</b>tShe turns around, walks out, leaving the lights on behind
ther.
<b>t
</b>tWe linger for a look at the video screens.  If only she'd
tdone the same, she'd see what we see.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>twe see the three men, still in the kitchen, huddled in a
tgroup, silently debating what to do.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tUsing the light that spills from the open door to the panic
troom, Meg comes back into the master bedroom and finds the
tproper door to the bathroom.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg SNAPS the cap off a jug of Advil and dumps three into her
tpalm.  She pops them in her mouth, searches for a glass for
twater, finds none, bends to the spout for a gulp to wash them
tdown.
<b>t
</b>tShe turns to the toilet.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tOn the monitor, we see the three men leave the kitchen and
tstart up the stairs.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg stands, flushes the toilet.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tOne floor down, Burnham, Raoul, and Junior freeze, just
tcoming up the stairs from the kitchen.  They look up, hearing
tthe water rushing through the pipes in the ceiling directly
tabove them.
<b>t
</b>tThey stare at the ceiling, following with their eyes as a
tpair of feet pad across the CREAKY floor.  Finally, they hear
ta SQUEAK of bedsprings as Meg climbs back into bed.
<b>t
</b>tThey hold a moment longer, a silence grows.  Raoul reaches
tinto his jacket pocket and pulls out a ski mask.  He pulls it
tover his head.  They look at him.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL

t          No face.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham rolls his eyes.  Doesn't know this guy much, but
thates him so far.  They start across the foyer toward the
tstairs.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg rolls over, to go back to sleep.  She sees she's left the
tlights on in the panic room.  She TSKS, gets out of bed, and
twalks across the floor toward it.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg steps into the panic room, raises her hand to the light
tswitch --
<b>t
</b>t-- and stops, her hand frozen in mid-air.  She cocks her
thead, looking at something she can't understand.
<b>t
</b>tShe blinks.  Takes a step, further into the room.  She stares
tat the video monitors -- at the three men in dark clothes,
tstealing silently across the foyer.
<b>t
</b>tThis can't be.  These are just pictures, they have no
trelation to reality.  She drops to her knees, her face inches
tfrom the screens, and reaches out to touch them, as if trying
tto make sure they're really there.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tThey reach the base of the stairs, Junior in the lead.  As he
treaches a bend at the base of the stairs, he places one foot
tshort on an angled step and it slips off.  He trips, falls
tforward.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tWatching the video monitors, Meg stares in horror as the
timage of Junior slipping is verified by the SLAP of his hands
ton the stairs as he catches himself, audible through the open
tdoor to the panic room.
<b>t
</b>tShe GASPS.  It is real.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b><b>t

tstaring at Junior as he turns and pulls himself to his feet.

</b>t               (points to Burnham)
t          Stay here.  Nobody gets past you.
<b>t
</b>tHe heads for the stairs.  Raoul follows close behind him.
tBurnham stays, reluctant -- what the fuck has he gotten
thimself into?
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg moves.  Leaps to her feet and dashes out of the room.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg races across her bedroom, flies out the door, and bolts
tup the carpeted stairs, headed for the top floor.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg races into Sarah's room, drops onto the bed, and grabs
tSarah by the shoulders, trying to rouse her.
<b>t

</b>t          Wake up... wake up...
<b>t
</b>tBut she's in a profound child's sleep and won't wake up.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tOne floor down, Junior and Raoul reach the third floor
tlanding.  Still moving stealthily, Junior heads down the hall
tfor the master bedroom, where he thinks Meg is sleeping.
tRaoul heads for the stairs that lead to the top floor.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Wake up...come on, come on...
<b>t
</b>tShe sees a plastic cup on her night table/box, half filled
twith water.  She snatches it and tosses the water in her
tface.
<b>t
</b>tNow she's awake.  And pissed off.  She SPUTTERS, SHOUTS.
<b>t

</b><b>t

</b><b>t

thears the kid shouting.  He starts up the stairs, quickly.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>tOn the top floor, Meg is already dragging Sarah out of the
troom and into the hallway.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>tMeg and Sarah come out of Sarah's bedroom just as Raoul
treaches the top of the stairs at the other end.  They're cut
toff.
<b>t
</b>tMeg freezes, staring at the hulking ski-masked figure at the
tend of the hallway.  She thinks, no idea what to do for a
tsecond.  She looks frantically to her right -- the bathroom,
tdead end.
<b>t
</b>tShe looks to her left.
<b>t
</b>tThe elevator.
<b>t
</b>tShe yanks open the elevator door, throws aside the gate, and
traces inside with Sarah.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul takes off down the hall, lunging for the elevator.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg SLAMS the gate shut and PUNCHES the button for the first
tfloor.  The elevator GROANS to life and starts down --
tslowly.

<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH

<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          People.  In the house.
<b>t
</b>tAs the elevator descends, they see Raoul, through the window
tin the door, as he drops to his knees, to get a good look at
tthem.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  TOP FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tRaoul turns from the elevator, SHOUTS to the open stairwell.

</b><b>t
</b>tJunior turns from the open doorway of the master bedroom and
traces back down the hall, toward the elevator.  He reaches
tthe door, peers through the window.
<b>t
</b>tHe sees the bare feet of Meg and Sarah, dropping toward him.
tHe grabs the door handle, pulls as hard as he can, but it
tstays locked, with the elevator moving beyond.
<b>t
</b>tHe bangs on the button, hoping the elevator will stop.  As
tMeg and Sarah drop fully into view, he stands there, eye to
tmoving eye with her for a moment.  But the elevator doesn't
tstop, it keeps going down.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg stands frozen, terrified, staring at Junior as they move
tpast him.
<b>t
</b>tJunior has another go at the door, pulling as hard as he can,
tactually bending the door, but the elevator is still moving,
tthe catch holds fast and the door won't open.
<b>t
</b>tAs they pass, his face suddenly disappears, he takes off.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tJunior flies down the stairs, to cut them off at the first
tfloor.
<b>t

<b>t
</b>tBut the elevator continues down.  She jabs at it, futilely.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b>t          No.  you gotta...
<b>t
</b>tShe reaches past her, pushes the STOP button.  The elevator
tjerks to a halt.  Then Sarah pushes three.  Now the elevator
tstarts to rise.
<b>t
</b>tMeg looks at her, impressed.  Love that kid.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the foyer, Junior freezes, hearing the elevator stop and
tstart again.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     JUNIOR
</b><b>t          SHE'S COMING BACK UP TOWARD YOU!!
</b><b>t

tanymore, he takes off after Junior, following him upstairs.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tRaoul, still on the top floor, heads for the stairs, fast.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tJunior races back up the stairs.  They have her caught in the
tmiddle.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tThe door to the elevator BANGS open on three, the gate
tRATTLES aside, and Meg and Sarah leap out.  They take off
tdown the hall, toward the doorway to the master bedroom.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul flies down the stairs, not twenty feet behind them.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg and Sarah run through the master bedroom.  As she passes
tthe night table, Sarah swings an open hand to grab her cell
tphone from its cradle.  But in her haste she starts to pull
tit out at an angle and the prongs at the bottom stick in the
tcharger.  The phone slips from her fingers, bounces off the
tcorner of the table, caroms off her foot, and skitters under
tthe bed.
<b>t
</b>tSarah turns, looks to the head of the stairs just as Junior
tturns the corner and Raoul thunders down the steps from four.
<b>t
</b>tShe abandons the phone, grabs Sarah, and they lunge through
tthe open doorway to the panic room.
<b>t
</b>tJunior and Raoul burst through the doorway to the bedroom,
tjust a few steps away.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg and Sarah trip over each other coming through the
tdoorway, they tumble to the floor of the panic room, the door
twide open behind them.  Meg spins around, hurls herself at
tthe red button on the wall --
<b>t
</b>t-- Junior leaps, sailing through the air toward them --
<b>t
</b>t-- Meg SLAMS her open palm on the red button, the massive
tcoiled spring that holds the metal door open is released, the
tsteel barrier leaps forward out of the wall --
<b>t
</b>t-- and WHANGS shut in a split-second.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tJunior SLAMS into the closing metal door, banging his
tshoulder into it, and slithers to the ground, too late.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg rolls over and pulls Sarah into her arms, both of them
tbreathing hard, asking each other if they're okay, scared out
tof their minds.
<b>t
</b>tBut safe.
<b>t
</b>tShe spots the telephone, the one with the special buried
tphone line.  She lunges for it, snatches it from its cradle,
tlistens for a dial tone.
<b>t
</b>tNothing there either.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG

t          it up!
<b>t
</b>tShe hurls it down, looks back at Sarah.  She seems a bit
tpale, scared.  She goes to her, holds her, reassures her.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tJunior is slumped at the base of the door, livid, in pain,
tpounding on it with his fists, screaming "NO!" over and over
tagain, crazy with rage.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul stands in the middle of the room, chest heaving, hands
ton his knees.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham finally walks into the room and stops in the doorway,
tlooks from Raoul to Junior to the door to the panic room,
tfigures out the situation.
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b>t          Don't worry about me.
<b>t
</b>tThe implications being, worry about yourself.
<b>t
</b>tSarah crawls over to the bank of video monitors, studies
tthem.  Meg crawls over to join her.  They scan the screens.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>tthere are a dozen different views of the house.  Front stoop.
tKitchen.  Dining room.  Entry floor.  Living room.  Master
tbedroom.  Den.  Top floor bedrooms, both of them.  Top two
tfloor hallways.  Even one with a shot of the inside of the
televator.
<b>t
</b>tThe three intruders are gathered in the living room, standing
tin a tight circle, having a hell of an argument.  Lots of
tgesturing, fingers jabbing in chests, but we can't hear a
tword.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg furrows her brow, noticing something interesting to the
tright of the video monitors.  She slides over, studies a
tpanel there with sixteen different buttons and a small
tgrilled area.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Hey...
<b>t
</b>tSarah joins her, looks at the buttons.  Each one is labeled
twith a different room name -- den, kitchen, master bedroom,
tetc.  Up in the corner there is a button that says "ALL
tPAGE," down in the opposite corner there's a button marked
<b>t"TALK."
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg looks at Sarah.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b>t          Go ahead.
<b>t
</b>tMeg is reluctant, frightened.  Sarah is encouraging, for the
tfirst time.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b>t          You can do it.
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tBurnham, Raoul, and Junior are standing in the half-darkened
tliving room, in the middle of their argument, when a VOICE
tbooms around them.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG (O.S.)
</b>t          Excuse me.
<b>t
</b>tThey practically jump out of their shoes, looking around for
tthe source of the voice.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG (O.S.)
</b>t          The police are on their way.
<b>t
</b>tOnly Burnham has remained relatively calm.  After he gets
tover the initial shock, he walks toward the tiny camera
tthat's hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and
tstares up at it.  Raoul, who has taken off his ski mask, is
tcareful to move out of the camera's range, and turn his back
tto it.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          I suggest you leave.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>tBurnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head, wagging a
tfinger from side to side.  He raises a hand, makes a gesture
tlike a telephone, then wags his finger again.  The message is
tclear -- you don't have a phone.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg is puzzled.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          How'd he know that?
<b>t
</b>tShe presses the talk button again.

</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t               (into speaker)
t          Take what you want and get out.
<b>t
</b>tThat sounded fairly tough.  She looks at the monitor again.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>tthe three of them have an urgent, whispered conference, then
tthey all start patting their pockets for some reason, turning
tin circles, looking for something.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg and Sarah watch them, confused.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>tBurnham holds up a finger to the camera -- wait a second --
twhile Raoul and Junior rush off screen, looking for
tsomething.  Junior returns a moment later holding something
tand the three of them hunch over a box, working on something.
<b>t
</b>tAfter a moment, they break apart and Junior steps up to the
tcamera holding a pad of paper.  He shows it to the camera.
tOn the top page, in big block letters, they've written.
<b>t
</b><b>tWHAT WE WANT
</b><b>t
</b>tAfter a suitable pause for reading, he turns to the second
tpage, where four more words are written.

</b>t          No, I told you, they can't.  It's
t          not a possibility.
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,

</b>tthere is more frenzied writing, more arguing, and a first
tdraft of a response torn up.  Finally, Junior steps forward
twith another sign:

</b><b>tMORE THAN YOU.
</b><b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg's confidence is ebbing, but she doesn't want to show it.

<b>t

tit, sort of, in Sarah's half-smile.  But Sarah's eyes go back
tto the screen.

tdumbfounded.
<b>t

<b>t

t          Junior cut the phones.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham goes to the window and stares outside.  He laughs,
tcovers his face.

t          house.  She can't even think she can
t          get out of this house.  We just keep

t          Joe Pesci here standing over them
t          with his fat sweaty finger on the

t          to end up with two dead bodies and
t          little puffs of smoke burning out of
t          our heads up in Greenhaven.  So
t          we're gonna seal the place up.  They
t          wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll
t          help 'em.  Make it impossible for
t          them to leave.  Once they come out

t          come out?
<b>t
</b>tAt the window, Burnham notices something sitting just outside
tthe French doors, on the balcony.  It's a large outdoor
tbarbecue grill.  He thinks, takes a step closer.
<b>t
</b>tHe sees a white five gallon tank of some kind underneath the
tgrill.

</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the panic room, Meg is sitting cross-legged on the floor,
tleaning against a wall, but Sarah is in motion, sorting
tthrough shelves, opening drawers.  Every drawer has something
tin it, sealed under plastic.  She opens and closes, sorts and
tlifts finds the following:
<b>t
</b>tWaterproof matches and lighters.
<b>t
</b>tFlashlights.
<b>t
</b>tUnopened packages of batteries.
<b>t
</b>tSealed water bags stamped "PURE FIVE YEARS FROM DATE."
<b>t
</b>tTinned food.
<b>t
</b>tFlares.
<b>t
</b>tPillows, fireproof blankets (we know because the bags are
tstamped FIREPROOF BLANKET).
<b>t
</b>tA complete tool kit.
<b>t
</b>tAs Sarah explores, she discovers something in the far wall at
tthe end of the room, down on the floor at eye level.
<b>t
</b>tIt's a small round portal, about eight inches across, with a
tfour-pronged cloverlike seal.  The portal is closed tight, as
tSarah pokes and scrapes at it idly with a finger or two, it
tresists her attempts to crank it open.
<b>t
</b>tMeg notices.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Hey.  Relax, okay?
<b>t
</b>tBut Sarah keeps at it, feels along the edges of the portal,
tthen all along the wall, looking for some kind of hidden
tswitch that controls it.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          I mean it, lie down.  You get your

</b>tAt the French doors that lead to the garden, Burnham has a
tcordless screwdriver and a pile of long screws in his hand.
tHe reaches up, drills a screw through the door, into the
tcorner of the door frame.  He does the same at the bottom of

tjust seem like they're pushing in on her, they are pushing in
ton her.
<b>t

tforever, she spins around, throws her head back, but there's
tthat voice again, insistent:
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH (O.S.)
</b>t          Mom, please!!
<b>t
</b>tThere is the sharp sound of a SLAP, and Meg's face abruptly
tjerks to the side.  She touches her cheek, confused, as a hot
tred handprint rises up on it.
<b>t
</b>tWhat the hell was that?
<b>t
</b><b>tBAM!
</b><b>t
</b>tNow the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a
tdeafening CRUNCH.  The smile vanishes from Meg's face, she
tturns.  Where did that come from?
<b>t
</b>tBAM!  Another one, even louder.  Meg's whole body winces at
tthe sound.
<b>t
</b>tBAM!  A third one, and on this one Meg falls to her knees,
tcovering her ears, walls spring up around her, right there on
tthe Great Lawn, we rush in on her, the walls close in, and
tshe's right back --
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>t-- in the panic room, where she always was, and that pounding
tis real, it's right outside the door, it's like somebody's
ttrying to smash their way right through the wall.
<b>t
</b>tSarah is right over Meg, holding her by the arms, and that
thandprint on Meg's face is real, Sarah must have slapped her
tto try to bring her out of it.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b><b>t          THEY'RE COMING IN!  THEY'RE COMING
</b><b>t          IN!
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg looks to the wall, watches it seem to vibrate as another
tdeafening BANG crunches into it from outside.
<b>t
</b>tBAM!  BAM!  BAM!  The sound is deafening.  Sarah throws both
thands over her ears.  Meg looks around, still disoriented.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b><b>t          YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK

</b>t          I'm here.  I'm here.
<b>t
</b>tThey huddle there, terrified.  Meg blinks, wipes the sweat
tfrom her forehead, begins to come back around.  She turns her
thead, sneaks a look at the funny wristwatch Sarah wears,
ttries to look without her daughter knowing.  It's not an
tordinary watch, it only has one number, a tall, flashing
tdigital display:
<b>t
</b><b>t120
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg nods, as if reassuring herself.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          We're fine.  We're okay.
<b>t
</b>tShe turns, looks at the video monitors to see what the hell
tthey're doing out there.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b><b>tBAM!
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the master bedroom, a claw hammer CRUNCHES into the
tsheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room.
<b>t
</b>tThe intruders are in the master bedroom now, and Burnham is
tlike a man possessed, tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp
tend of the tool while Junior shines a flashlight into the
thole.
<b>t
</b>tAs the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the wall
tbehind it.  There's a latticework of two by four studs, and
tbeyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core.
<b>t
</b>tBut that's not what he's after.  He continues tearing,
treveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding into
tthe panic room through a welded hole in the steel.  Burnham
ttears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of the
tduct.
<b>t
</b>tCLANG!  The claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox.
tBurnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case.
tThis one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, along
twith a couple dozen specialized bits.  He selects one, twists
tit into the drill.
<b>t
</b>tAt the wall, Burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch.
tA horrendous METAL SCREECH fills the air and the drill bit
ttears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the size
tof a quarter.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carrying a
tcoiled garden hose.  Burnham snaps his fingers for it, Raoul
ttosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils in
tthe air as it snakes across the room.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole he's
tjust drilled in the air duct.
<b>t
</b>tRIP!  He tears off a length of duct tape and seals the
tconnection, makes it airtight.
<b>t
</b>tSLIT!  Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foot
tsection of the garden hose off the coil.
tHe stretches it out, across the room, to the white five
tgallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor
tup here.  We move in close as Burnham snugs the cut end of
tthe garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank.  Red
tblock letters are easy to read on the side of the tank.
<b>t
</b><b>tPROPANE
</b><b>tCAUTION - FLAMMABLE
</b><b>t
</b>tAlong with a number of other dire warnings.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham raises his hand to the knob, hesitates, doesn't
treally want to do this, but doesn't stop himself either.
<b>t
</b>tHe spins it open.  Halfway.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     JUNIOR
</b>t          Open it.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM

<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL

<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Just sending a message.  She'll get
t          the point.
<b>t
</b>tGas HISSES through the spigot and into the hose.  We follow
talong the length of the hose, across the floor of the room,
tthrough the hole in the sheetrock, into the hole that's been
tdrilled in the air duct --
<b>t
</b><b>tINSIDE THE WALL
</b><b>t
</b>t-- through the wall itself, where we see the horizontal lines
tof an air vent up ahead.  We squeeze between two of the
thorizontal lines --
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>t-- and come out in the panic room.  Three red streamers, tied
tto the air vent, flap to life as the gas HISSES into the
tpanic room.
<b>t
</b>tDirectly underneath the vent, Meg is hunched up against the
twall, her arm around Sarah.
<b>t
</b>tShe sniffs.
<b>t
</b>tAgain.
<b>t
</b>tSarah sniffs.
<b>t
</b>tThey look at each other.
<b>t
</b>tShe looks up.  Sees the streamers floating above her.
<b>t
</b>tShe leaps to her feet, steps up onto a shelf, and stretches
ther nose toward the streamers.  Just as she does --

</b>t          We ain't playin', here.
<b>t

tThe gas pours into the hose with an audible WHOOSH.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg, at the vent, falls back, two lungfuls of propane, and
tdrops to her knees on the floor.

</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg and Sarah are down on the floor, rags covering their
tmouths, trying like crazy to filter the air, but it's not
tworking.  Sarah is crawling around the base of the wall, near
tto where she was before, clawing at the strange portal thing
tagain.
<b>t
</b>tFinally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the
tclover-leaf seal on the portal.  She unfolds it, twists it.
<b>t
</b>tThe portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a
ttube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source
tdirectly through to the exterior of the house.  She bends
tdown and looks through it.  It's covered by a metal mesh at
tthe opposite end, but she can see and smell the outside
tthrough it.
<b>t
</b>tShe sits up, gestures to her mother to bend down next to her.
tShe does, and they both jam their mouths up near the end of
tthe tube, gulping fresh air greedily.
<b>t
</b>tMeg looks at Sarah, good job, and they both drop to the floor
tat the portal and suck air.  It's temporary, but it works.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the master bedroom, the debate has turned physical.
tBurnham lunges across the room at Raoul, to get his hands on
tthe valve, to turn off the gas.  But Raoul catches him and
thurls him aside.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham SLAMS into the wall, bounces off and SCREAMS at
tRaoul, who SCREAMS right back.  Junior leaps into the middle,
ttrying to break it up, to get them to shut up, keep their
tvoices down.
<b>t
</b>tIt's bedlam.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the panic room, Meg knows this can't go on forever.  She
tturns away from the portal, looks up at the vent, where the
tstreamers still stream.
<b>t
</b>tShe looks to the other side of the room, to where Sarah found
tthe waterproof matches and lighters.
<b>t
</b>tShe thinks.  Takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube
tand crawls over to the lighters.  She selects one, snatches
tup a screwdriver.
<b>t
</b>tSarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking,
tbut can't believe it.  She shakes her head vehemently.
<b>t
</b>tIn response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof
tblankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her
tdisbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of
tair.  but she's getting woozy.  This can't go on much longer.
<b>t
</b>tShe staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the
tshelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the
tvent.  Holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas,
tshe unscrews the vent cover.
<b>t
</b>tThe duct is wide enough to put your arm in.  She reaches in,
tpast a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the
twall.  She reaches all the way in, lighter in hand.
<b>t
</b><b>tINSIDE THE DUCT,
</b><b>t
</b>twe see her hand crawl in, lighter clenched between her
tfingers.  She raises a thumb to the flint wheel, cranks it
tonce.
<b>t
</b>tToo slow.  Not even a spark.
<b>t
</b>tHer hand shakes.  She tries again.  Still no spark.  But with
tthe effort and the angle, when she thumbs the lighter it
tmakes her hand twitch, banging up against the sides of the
tduct with a hollow BOOM.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tBurnham turns abruptly.
<b>t
</b>tHe turns around.  They all freeze, listening.  He hears it
tagain.  The hollow BOOM, coming from inside the wall.  Now a
tthird time.
<b>t
</b>tHe walks forward, slowly, toward the wall.
<b>t
</b><b>tBOOM.
</b><b>t
</b>tHe moves closer, gets right up next to the wall.  He leans
tinto the wall, putting his ear right up next to the air duct.
tThis close, he hears the sound in more detail, realizes it's
ttwo sounds.
<b>t
</b><b>tSCRATCH.  BOOM.
</b><b>t
</b>tHe arches an eyebrow.
<b>t
</b><b>tINSIDE THE DUCT,
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg's hand is trembling, tiring.  She tries again, thumbs the
tflint wheel.  It SCRATCHES as it rolls, her hand twitches,
tBOOMS against the side of the duct.
<b>t
</b>tStill, the gas HISSES through.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg's face is turning color, she's running out of air.  Her
tfeet tremble on the shelf, she's about to lose her footing.
<b>t
</b><b>tINSIDE THE DUCT,
</b><b>t
</b>tshe tries again.  SCRATCH.  BOOM.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE BEDROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tBurnham's eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Oh.
<b>t
</b>tHe tears himself away from the wall --
<b>t
</b><b>tINSIDE THE DUCT,
</b><b>t
</b>t-- Meg's thumb tenses for one good hard turn --
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE BEDROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>t-- Burnham leaps through the air, hurling himself toward the
tpropane tank --
<b>t
</b><b>tINSIDE THE DUCT,
</b><b>t
</b>t-- Meg cranks the wheel, a spark sparks, a flame flames, and
ta hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions, one toward the
tpanic room, the other toward the bedroom.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg jumps off the shelf, throwing herself as far away from
tthe vent as she can, her arm engulfed by licking blue flame.
tShe drops to the floor of the room, covering her daughter's
tbody just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into
ta lake of fire with a deafening WHOOMP.  The fluorescent
tlight tubes EXPLODE, showering glass everywhere.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE BEDROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tthe blue flame shoots out of the wall, into the hose, through
tthe hose, backing up toward the tank.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham CRUNCHES to the floor next to the tank, knocking the
tother end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue
tflame erupts from the end of the hose.
<b>t
</b>tThe flame engulfs his entire body, his hair starts on fire,
this chest, his arms.  Raoul lunges forward, Junior tears the
tblankets from the bed and throws them over him, Burnham HOWLS
tand rolls on the floor in pain.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tthe blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with
tanother angry WHOOMP, leaving a few little pockets of flame
tthat Meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket.  Only one
tof the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a
tflickering, uneven light on the room.
<b>t
</b>tShe stands in the middle of the still-smoky panic room,
tbreathing hard.  She shouts, SCREAMS incomprehensibly, making
tno sense whatsoever.
<b>t
</b>tShe stops, noticing the look Sarah is giving her.  Wide-eyed
tadmiring, frightened, you are an insane woman.
<b>t
</b>tMeg looks to herself.  Her arm is signed, the hair burned
toff.  The sleeve of her T-shirt is burned back to the
tshoulder.  Her face is sooty, blackened.
<b>t
</b>tMeg GRUNTS, half frightened by herself.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tOut in the bedroom, it's worse for Burnham, who has lost most
tof his hair and shirt.  But his skin isn't badly burned,
twhich is something, I guess.
<b>t
</b>tStill, he's in a rage.  He POUNDS the metal door of the panic
troom.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM

tcan hardly make out a word she's saying, but it sounds
tthreatening.
<b>t
</b>tSuddenly, she stops, hearing something else.  Outside the
tdoor, Burnham continues to rant, but there's a second sound,
ta sound coming from the long wall of the panic room, the wall
tthat's shared with the brownstone next door.
<b>t
</b>tIt's a faint -- very faint -- POUNDING sound, along with a
thigh pitched, complaining voice, so faint it can hardly be
theard.  Sarah hears it too.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b>t          Neighbor!
<b>t
</b>tMeg and Sarah leap as one, facing the common wall, SHOUTING
tat the tops of their lungs -- get help, call the police,
tplease, call the police, that sort of thing.
<b>t
</b>tThey shout and shout, but the soft pounding continues, and if
ttheir voices are as soft on the other side as the COMPLAINING
tVOICE is on this side, they have no hope.
<b>t
</b>tTheir voices crack and they begin to cough, too irritated by
tthe gas to shout for very long.  Long after they stop, the
tsoft POUNDING from next door continues.
<b>t
</b>tTheir pleas are not heard.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tThe Intruders have stopped their racket too, and are
tlistening carefully at the common wall.  Eventually, the soft
tPOUNDING stops, the complaining voice complains no more.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham stands there, in pain.  Things are falling apart.
tRaoul stands in the doorway, silhouetted by the hallway
tlight.  He draws himself up to his full, bulky height.  He's
tbig.

tBurnham tries to follow him, Raoul puts a big hand on his
tchest stopping him.

<b>t
</b>tBurnham swallows.  But stays.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul turns, follows Junior downstairs.  As he descends, he
tlooks up, making eye contact with Burnham.  And holding it.
tSomething on his mind, that's for sure.

</b><b>t
</b>tTHUNK.  Meg's head falls back against a wall; she sags to the
tfloor, legs folded in front of her, completely drained.
<b>t
</b>tBut Sarah's not drained, Sarah's full of nervous ingenuity,
trustling around through the stuff in the panic room, an idea
tforming in her head.  She finds a powerful-looking flashlight
tand loads it up with batteries.  She tries it, flashing
taround the room.
<b>t
</b>tHalogen bulb, very powerful, hurts her mother's eyes as she
tflashes it past.  Meg watches her.  What's she up to?
<b>t
</b>tSarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she
tdiscovered earlier.  She squints through it.
<b>t
</b><b>tTHROUGH THE TUBE,
</b><b>t
</b>tshe can see out of the house, into the courtyard behind the
tbrownstone.
<b>t
</b>tAbout thirty yards away she can see the backs of the
tbrownstones on the next block, and directly across (because
tthe tube doesn't leave much room for lateral vision) she can
tsee straight into somebody's bedroom.
<b>t
</b>tThere's a light on.  A SLEEPING MAN is in bed, an open book
ton his chest.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tSarah sits back.
<b>t
</b>tShe grabs the flashlight, looks for a little button on the
ttop, the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with.
tShining it on the wall of the panic room, she flashes it at a
twall, three times, on and off.  Satisfied, she turns back to
tthe tube.
<b>t
</b>tMeg, curious, crawls across the floor to join her.  Sarah
tshoves the flashlight all the way into the tube, leaving
tenough room on either side of it for them to see through.
tMeg lays down flat, squints into the tube, Sarah alongside
ther.  She looks at her daughter, curious -- your plan?
<b>t
</b>tSarah reaches into the tube, finds the little flash button on
tthe top of the flashlight.
<b>t
</b><b>tTHROUGH THE TUBE,
</b><b>t
</b>tthe piercing halogen beam begins to flash, across the
tcourtyard and into the bedroom of the Man in the bedroom.
tThe light flashes on the wall over his bed.
<b>t

tbehind him has no effect.

tshining directly into the Sleeping Man's eyes.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,

tstarting to sweat.  Meg leans over, sneaks a peek at the
twatch Sarah wears on her left wrist.  The readout:

</b><b>t
</b><b>tTHROUGH THE TUBE,
</b><b>t

tlight, which is flashing directly in his eyes.

tlight, which keeps flashing on him.

tagainst it, cups his hands so he can see better.  The flashes
tcontinue, right on top of him now.
<b>t
</b>tClearly, the Man is reading the flashes!  He takes a steps
tback from the window --

<b>t
</b>tA moment later, the light goes out and the room is black.

tlike hell to hear a conversation that Junior and Raoul are
thaving in the foyer, one floor one.
<b>t
</b>tThey're trying to keep their voices down, but stray words

tstaring at the screen.

tusing for a night table.  On top of the box, she sees the
tcharger for her cellular phone, sitting empty.

trealizes it's screwed shut.  He takes out a screwdriver and
tstarts unscrewing the screws.  Burnham stops at the stairway.
<b>t

tof wind gusts in, it's a blustery night out there, he takes a
tstep into the doorway --
<b>t
</b>t-- and with a quiet PFFFT from right behind Burnham, a bullet
twhizzes across the kitchen and hits Junior in the back of the
thead.  He crumples, right in the open kitchen doorway.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham SHOUTS incoherently and turns.  Raoul is standing
tthere, two steps up, a silencer twisted onto the barrel of
this gun.

<b>t

tdrags him back into the house.  He turns, looks at Burnham,
twhose jaw is dropped in horror.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL

t          You don't know one thing about me!
<b>t

tstares at Burnham, his back to the outside, a small, thin

</b><b>t

twho grabs him roughly and drags him inside.  Burnham hurries
tto the door --

</b><b>tINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>t-- and SLAMS it shut.  He puts his back to it, thinking,
tterrified, things are spinning out of control, fast.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul, in the middle of the kitchen floor, is venting some
tmore of his rage on Harris, whom he has hurled to the floor.
tHe lands a solid boot in the side of Harris's head, leaving
thim GROANING in pain, completely disoriented.
<b>t

tfrom underneath Junior.

<b>t
</b>tHe pulls his gun, shoves it into Burnham's eye, hard, we can
thear the faint SIZZLE of skin burning.

<b>t
</b>tRaoul pulls the gun back, just an inch.  The skin around
tBurnham's eye is an angry red.  His eyes dart, strain to look
tover at Harris, MOANING on the floor.  And at Junior, dead.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM

taway, shaking.  He bends down, to the floor.  He looks at

tfeebly.

<b>t

tSarah sits up, recognizes her father's voice.

</b><b>t

tbeat him.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham stands by, powerless, horrifies, watching as Raoul
tsavages Harris, who continues to call out, as long as he has
tstrength, telling Meg not to open the door, no matter what.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg and Sarah SHOUT in horror, she covers her daughter's
tface, turn her away from the screen, SCREAMS in incoherent
tanger of her own.

</b><b>t
</b>tBut Raoul whips the gun up, into Burnham's throat, backing
thim off, shutting him up.
<b>t
</b>tHe resumes his pounding of Harris.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham turns, looks up at the camera in the corner of the
troom.
<b>t
</b>tHe can't stand it anymore.  He whips off his jacket, runs to
tthe camera, and covers the lens.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tWhile Meg watches, the monitor that cover the master bedroom
tabruptly goes black, mercifully sparing them the sight of
tHarris's beating.
<b>t

<b>t

</b><b>t

tmonitor, but it's hopeless, it's covered.  On the hallway
tmonitor, she can just see shadows, as two men in the bedroom
tlift a third off the floor and carry him across the room.
<b>t
</b>tA sudden BEEPING sound tears her attention away.  Still
tholding Sarah, she pulls her back, off her shoulder.  Her
tface is completely white, her lips blue, her eyes rolled back
tinto her head.  The BEEPING sound grows louder, she checks
tSarah's wristwatch, the reading is dire:
<b>t
</b><b>t57
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg GASPS, horrifies.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Oh God, oh my God...
<b>t
</b>tSarah begins to convulse, she bucks right out of Meg's arms
tand falls back onto the floor of the panic room.  Meg clears
teverything away from her, tries to make room for her.
<b>t
</b>tThe convulsion worsens.  Meg searches through the piles of
tsupplies, comes up with a plastic-handled screwdriver.  She
topens Sarah's jaws, wedges the plastic handle between her
tteeth.
<b>t
</b>tShe helps Sarah ride out the convulsion.  Finally, her eyes
troll back into her head, she slowly re-orients herself.
tSarah reaches over, turns off her still-BEEPING
twristwatch/monitor herself.
<b>t
</b>tSarah sighs, a shuddering sigh of relief, but she is nowhere
tnear normal.
<b>t
</b>tHer skin has passed through white and is turning a sallow
tyellow color.  She moves her lips, Meg can't hear her, she
tbends down:
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b>t          You gotta jab me, Mommy...
<b>t
</b>tMeg turns, looks back at the monitors.  What she sees is good
tnews --
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>tthe jacket has been removed from the bedroom camera.  Burnham
tand Raoul are gone, the only person there is HARRIS, who lies
tslumped on the far side of the bed.

</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg looks quickly over at the monitor for the living room.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THAT MONITOR,
</b><b>t
</b>tshe sees Burnham and Raoul having an urgent conversation,
tBurnham sitting in a chair, Raoul pacing in front of him,
tranting.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg's face lights up, she practically laughs, she's so
toverjoyed at this turn of events.
<b>t
</b>tShe turns, looks back at Sarah, who is starting to tremble
tagain.
<b>t
</b>tThat does it.  Meg leaps up, hits the button that controls
tthe steel door, and it starts to crank open, almost
timpossibly slowly.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg steps out of the panic room, into the master bedroom.
tShe looks at Harris, on the bed.  With his back to her she
tcan't even tell if he's alive or dead, but first things must
tbe first, so she turns and races out of the room.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg flies up the stairs, bare feet on padded carpet.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the living room, Raoul looks up, hearing the pitter-pat of
ther feet on the stairs above.
<b>t
</b>tHe smiles and pulls his ski mask back on, to cover his face.
<b>t
</b>tComing around behind him, we see Burnham sitting in the
tchair.  Except it isn't Burnham at all, it's Harris,
tunconscious, wearing Burnham's shirt.
<b>t
</b>tAnd if Harris is the person in the chair, that means --
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>t-- the person on the bed in the bedroom is Burnham, wearing
tHarris's shirt.  His eyes pop open, he sits up, sees the wide
topen door to the panic room.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg races into Sarah's bedroom and tears open the door of a
tmini-fridge.  Inside are dozens of little bottles of insulin
tand something called Glucogen.
<b>t
</b>tShe grabs a bottle of Glucogen and a black leather pouch and
ttakes off.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tAs Meg nears the bottom of the stairs, she sees a horrifying
tsight.  It's Raoul, ski mask over his face, standing in the
tdoorway of the master bedroom.
<b>t
</b>tShe SCREAMS, he SLAMS the door, she takes off down the hall,
treaches the end, throws the door open --
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>t-- and races into the master bedroom, where Raoul is
tmotoring, fast, headed for the panic room, where she can
talready see Burnham, standing in the middle of the open
tdoorway, in front of Sarah, wearing Harris's shirt and a grim
t"tricked you" expression.
<b>t
</b>tMeg hurls herself at Raoul, lands clinging to his back.  She
tclaws and wrestles with him, gets one hand on his ski mask,
ttears it from his head.  He reaches up to try to stop her
tfrom pulling it off --
<b>t
</b>t-- his gun slips from his fingers, falls to the floor --
<b>t
</b>t-- and caroms off his boot, spinning across the floor away
tfrom them.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul flips her off his back violently, she CRUNCHES to the
tfloor, clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his
tface.  He makes a move toward his gun, but she's faster,
tshe's already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood
ttoward it.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul measures the distance, knows he'll lose, and sprints
tfor the panic room instead.  Meg turns, looks down at the
tmedicine in her hands, then at the door to the panic room,
twhere Raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that
tcontrols the steel door.
<b>t
</b>tShe makes a fast decision and lunges, hurling the plastic
tbottle of Glucogen and the black leather pouch through the
tgap just before --
<b>t
</b>t-- the spring-loaded steel door SLAMS shut with tremendous
tferocity.
<b>t
</b>tAnd then it's silent.  Meg WAILS in agony, POUNDS on the
tdoor.
<b>t
</b>tShe stands back, chest heaving, sobbing.
<b>t
</b>tA looooong moment goes by.
<b>t
</b>tFinally, a VOICE comes over the house's intercom system.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL (O.S.)

tterrified.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tBurnham pushes past Raoul, at the speaker button, and leans
tforward.  He's approaching exhaustion.
<b>t

t          I just... I just need forty-five
t          minutes.
<b>t

<b>t

</b>t          Saw my face, man.  Saw my face.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>twe see Meg's face, agonized, as she lunges toward the camera,
tSCREAMING something up at it, the same thing, over and over.
tBut in here her voice is nearly muted, what bleeds through
tthe walls isn't enough to be heard.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tRaoul looks at her image on the monitor, irritated.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          Shut up.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tSarah shivers in a corner, knees pulled up to her chest,
tstaring at the intruders, scared out of her wits, and looking
tvery, very sick.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham looks at her, musters the most reassuring face he can
tcome up with under the circumstances.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          It's gonna be cool, kid.  Be outta
t          here before you know it.
<b>t
</b>tNo response from Sarah.  Burnham cocks a head, really looking
tat her.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Are you okay?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
<b>t
</b>tBurnham turns, grabs his satchel, and drops to his knees in
tthe middle of the floor.  Over his shoulder, we can see the
tface of Meg on one of the monitors, shouting into the camera,
tbegging them to give Sarah her medicine.
<b>t
</b>tUsing his hand, Burnham measures six lengths in from the
twall, then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet,
tlooking for a seam.
<b>t
</b>tHe finds one, gets hold of it on one edge, and runs his other
thand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to
tturn a corner.  He stands, hovering over the carpet, and
tpulls back evenly with both hands.
<b>t
</b>tThe concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly, with the soft
tsound of tearing VELCRO.  Underneath the flap --
<b>t
</b>t-- is the smooth metal door of a floor safe.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove.  It rolls
tout and opens up onto the floor, revealing a neat array of
tsafecracking tools.
<b>t
</b>tHe begins his delicate work, but is suddenly jarred by a
tPOUNDING on the metal door.  He turns, annoyed.  Meg is still
tSCREAMING outside the door.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          The hell does she want?

t          the same thing over and over.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham turns, looks at the monitors.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg is staring up at the camera, miming the act of giving
therself an injection in the arm.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,

</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          Drugs.  She wants drugs.  What the
t          fuck?
<b>t
</b>tBut Burnham thinks.  His eyes fall on the bottle and the
tleather pouch she hurled through the door, then whip over to
tSarah, who sags over into a fetal position on the floor.  Her
tlips are moving.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Oh, man...
<b>t
</b>tHe crawls over to Sarah, puts his ear down next to Sarah's
tlips.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          What is it?
<b>t

tbreath comes hard.
<b>t

tthe floor nearby.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          That stuff?
<b>t
</b>tSarah nods again.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Can you do it yourself?
<b>t
</b>tSarah shakes her head no.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Well, I don't know how.
<b>t

tBurnham.

</b>tSarah looks terrified, shaking her head no.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          Come on.
<b>t
</b>tHe starts to pull Burnham away, but Burnham shakes his hand
toff, violently.  He bends down very close to Sarah's lips.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Tell me the truth, okay?  What's

<b>t
</b>tSarah swallows, licks her cracking lips.  When she speaks,
tit's breathy, almost inaudible.
<b>t
</b>tBut the words are clear.

tin the room the desperate situation.
<b>t
</b>tSuddenly, a VOICE comes over the intercom speaker.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM (O.S.)

<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tA HAND comes down into frame and picks up the Glucogen and
tthe leather pouch.  Burnham stands, looking down at them.
tRaoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          You're wasting your fucking time,

<b>t

</b>t          Are you gonna open the safe?
<b>t
</b>tRaoul looks at him.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Then shut up and get out of my way.
<b>t
</b>tAs Burnham crosses the room, Raoul makes eye contact with
tSarah, who is staring at him.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          Don't look at me.
<b>t

</b>t          Okay, kid, all I know about this is
t          what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk
t          me through it.
<b>t
</b>tSarah tries to form words, but she's too weak.  Burnham
tswallows.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV
t          don't lie, right?
<b>t
</b>tHe reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad,
tand a length of rubber tubing.  He takes Sarah's arm,
tstretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          You seem like a good kid.  Your

t          but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?
<b>t
</b>tNo answer.  Burnham ties the rubber tubing around Sarah's

<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM

</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Attagirl.  That too tight?
<b>t

tto fill it from the Glucogen bottle.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          You guys are pretty rich, huh?
<b>t
</b>tSarah shrugs.  While Burnham goes through the process of
tfinding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he
tgoes on, as much to comfort Sarah as to comfort himself:

tRaoul dropped.

tin the chair.  He's in awful shape, barely conscious.

tit's the worst thing that could happen.
<b>t
</b>tShe stands, thinking, desperate.  She walks toward the door,
tstops, thinks some more.
<b>t
</b>tThe doorbell RINGS again.
<b>t
</b>tShe comes up with a plan.  She goes back to where Harris is
tin the chair, pulls the chair back a few feet, out of view of

t          you just want to make a signal, by
t          blinking a few times, something like
t          that.
<b>t
</b>tShe just looks at him.  Wow, this guy's intuitive.  She is
tsorely tempted.  But she can't.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     COP 1

<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          Okay, look.  My husband and I just
t          broke up.  It's my first night in

t          little lonely and a little drunk.
t          The sentence, if you insist on

t          come over right now and get in bed
t          with me."
<b>t

<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          But thank God I came to my senses

<b>t

tmoment, trying to read her mind.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,

</b><b>t
</b>tBurnham and Raoul breathe a sigh of relief.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham goes back to work on the safe.  He's making progress.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul looks at Sarah.  Stares actually.  He's thinking too.
<b>t
</b>tBad thoughts.  He moves over, crouches down next to Burnham.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          She saw my face.  The kid too.
<b>t
</b>tSarah overhears that.  She raises her head, alarmed.  Burnham
tturns, looks over at her, and she just gets her head back
tdown in time.  Burnham and Raoul close themselves off, for a
tprivate conversation.
<b>t
</b>tSarah edges closer.  She overhears a fragment.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          That's your problem.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          That's their problem.
<b>t
</b>tSarah is terrified.  Doesn't know what to do.  She looks to
ther immediate left, sees the intercom panel.  She edges
tcloser.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Let me fucking finish this so we can

<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the living room, there is an audible CLICK as the speaker
tis activated.  Meg looks up, hears Burnham's voice, in the
tmiddle of a sentence.
<b>t

</b>t          They stay in the house.
<b>t
</b>tThere in an abrupt CLICK, and the speaker turns off.  Meg
tturns, goes to Harris, falls to her knees, no idea what to
tdo.  She holds him close, their foreheads touching.  She's
tterrified, exhausted, wants to collapse in his arms.
<b>t
</b>tInstead, she starts to pull the gun from his fingers.  He
ttightens his grip, what are you doing?  He tries to hold onto
tthe gun, but she pulls his fingers off it, takes it away from
thim.  He is too weak to resist.

</b>tIn the panic room, Sarah has her hands clamped over her ears,
ther mouth is wide open, and a hideous METAL SHRIEK seems to
tbe coming out of it.
<b>t
</b>tBut the SHRIEK is actually coming from the safe, where
tBurnham continues to work, another drill, a bigger bit.  The
tnoise is deafening.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>tSarah sees her mother approaching the monitor in the bedroom,
tcarrying a jacket.  Meg tosses the jacket, this time she
tdoesn't want them to see what she's doing.
<b>t
</b>tThe monitor goes black.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tIn the master bedroom, Meg pulls on a pair of jeans that are
thanging over a chair.
<b>t
</b>tShe steps into a pair of boots.
<b>t
</b>tShe shoves the gun into her belt.
<b>t
</b>tHere in the bedroom, she can hear the drill.  From the house
tnext door, she hears POUNDING again, more MUFFLED CURSES.
tApparently the neighbor can hear the drill too.
<b>t
</b>tMeg looks from the walls of the bedroom to the walls of the
tpanic room.  Her eyes light up with an idea.
<b>t
</b>tShe goes to the front wall of the bedroom, stands with her
tback against the exterior wall (street side), with her left
tshoulder against the common wall that's shared with the
tneighbor's brownstone.
<b>t
</b>tShe begins to step off the distance, heel to toe, measuring
twith her feet until she reaches the metal door that is the
tentrance to the panic room.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG

</b>tShe hurries out of the bedroom.  What's she doing?
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg comes into a small room full of empty bookshelves, a
tlibrary.  There is a window that looks out over the sidewalk,
tone floor up, same level as the stoop.

</b>tShe looks up, into the corners of the room.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     MEG
</b>t          No camera, no camera, no camera...
<b>t

<b>t
</b>tShe goes to the window, tries to open it.  Screwed shut, of
tcourse.
<b>t

</b><b>t
</b>tThe safe is almost cracked.  Raoul is watching the monitors
tcarefully.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>twe see Meg as she searches through the tools in the living
troom, finds a screwdriver, a sledgehammer.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,

</b>tRaoul furrows his brow.  Now what?
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tMeg is back in the library, hurriedly unscrewing the window.
tShe gets the last screw out, shoves the window up.
<b>t
</b>tThe wind BLASTS in, it's a hell of a spooky night out there.
<b>t
</b>tShe leans out the window.  We lean with her.  The sidewalk is
tempty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the
thouse).  She's one floor up.  To her right is the house's
tfront stoop.
<b>t
</b>tShe tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop.  Climbs up
tonto the window ledge, and slithers out herself.
<b>t
</b>tWe lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops
tdown onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror --
<b>t
</b>t-- at the video camera that covers the front stoop.
<b>t
</b><b>tON THE MONITORS,
</b><b>t
</b>twe see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly
tstanding on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was
tspecifically told not to go.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tSarah sees the image of her on the stoop.  Raoul happens to
tbe looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to
tturn around, to look at the monitors again --
<b>t
</b>t-- and Sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          Hey!
<b>t

</b>t          Sorry.  Can't control it sometimes.
<b>t

<b>t

tthe monitor.

</b><b>t
</b>tStill leaning out the window, we can see Meg from here as she
treaches the sidewalk and runs up the front steps of the
tneighbor's house, which is contiguous.
<b>t
</b>tStraining to see (yet stay in the house), we see Meg all the
tway at the right edge of the frame, as she shifts the gun to
tthe back of her pants and knocks on the neighbor's door,
tsledgehammer held slightly behind her leg.
<b>t
</b>tAfter a long moment, we hear the neighbor's front door open.
tThe conversation begins.  The wind is gusting right in our
tfaces, we can't make out the details, but the gist is clear --
tlet me into your house, and don't as me a lot of questions.
<b>t
</b>tThe NEIGHBOR -- and by the tone of the voice it sounds like
tan old woman -- is slow to respond, grumpy.
<b>t
</b>tLosing patience, Meg just pulls the Neighbor out of the way
tand shoves into the house.  The Neighbor stumbles out onto
ther front stoop, and we were right, it's an old lady in a
tnightgown, but she's no shrinking violet.  In fact, she's
troyally pissed off and not at all intimidated.

</b><b>t                     NEIGHBOR
</b>t          What the hell do you think you're
t          doing, young lady?!
<b>t
</b>tShe storms back into her house, following Meg.  As both of
tthem disappear from the frame, we move out of the library,
tinto the foyer, and move along the common wall, the one
tshared with the neighbor's brownstone.
<b>t
</b>tFrom the other side of the wall, we can hear muffled voices,
targuing, Meg and the Neighbor shouting at each other.
<b>t
</b>tWe drift up, up the stairs, and hear the THUNDERING of
tfootsteps on the stairs next door.  We keep pace with them,
tfrom inside this house.  We pass right through the floor --
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>t-- and rise up out of the floor in the master bedroom, and
tnow we can hear the conversation on the other side of the
twall in here, the Neighbor's fearful, angry tones, Meg's
tfirm, urgent declarations.
<b>t
</b>tWe move with Meg, even though we can't see her, we know what
tshe's doing, she's stepping off the paces on the other side
tof the wall.  We drift down that wall, fourteen steps, until
twe reach the metal door to the panic room, then we pass
tthrough that door --
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>t-- and arrive inside the panic room, where Burnham is this
tclose to getting the safe open, when all of a sudden --
<b>t
</b><b>tWHOMP.
</b><b>t
</b><b>tCRUNCH.
</b><b>t
</b>tBurnham and Raoul freeze, alarmed.  It's coming from the long
twall, the shared wall.
<b>t
</b>tThey look at each other.
<b>t
</b><b>tWHOMP.
</b><b>t
</b><b>tCRUNCH.
</b><b>t
</b>tThey look at the wall.
<b>t
</b>tSomebody is on the other side, pounding like hell.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          The walls are steel, right?
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Not that one.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b><b>t          NOT THAT ONE?!
</b><b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Hey man, it's the neighbor's house,
t          who breaks in through the neighbor's
t          house?!
<b>t
</b><b>tWHOMP!  CRUNCH!
</b><b>t
</b>tLouder.  Closer.  Burnham turns, SCREAMS at the wall.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b><b>t          WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE
</b><b>t          NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
</b><b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b>t          We've got the Kid!
t               (shouting at the wall)
t          WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck
t          is she thinking?!
<b>t
</b><b>tWHOMP!  CRUNCH!
</b><b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          She's got your gun, that's what
t          she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to
t          bring a gun for?!
<b>t
</b>tBurnham throws himself back on the floor, goes back to work
ton the safe.  Fires up the drill again, it SCREAMS into the
tmetal.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Almost there...
<b>t
</b>tThe POUNDING keeps up from next door.  We hear sheetrock torn
taway on the far side.  Bricks, SCRAPING out of place.
<b>t
</b>tSarah, in the corner, is energized, excited.  While Burnham
tand Raoul are distracted, she grabs the leather pouch, palms
tthe three syringes that are left in there.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b><b>t          ALMOST THERE...
</b><b>t
</b>tFinally, the door to the safe CRUNCHES in on one side,
tyielding to the drilling --
<b>t
</b>t-- at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer CRASHES
tthrough the wall of the panic room.  Raoul grabs hold of
tSarah, Burnham maintains his focus, throwing open the safe,
trevealing --
<b>t
</b>t-- nothing.
<b>t
</b><b>tCRUNCH!
</b><b>t
</b>tThe sledgehammer head strikes again, opening up a hole about
ta foot across.  Light spills through from the other side, as
twell as the voice of the hysterical Neighbor.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul hurls Sarah against the far wall, leaps over to the
tside of the hole, and waits, poised above it.
<b>t
</b>tAt the safe, Burnham doesn't lose his cool, just opens a
tfalse bottom in the safe, revealing a manila envelope.
<b>t
</b>tHe snatches it up, RIPS it open, and his eyes dance as he
tholds up fourteen individual one million dollar U,S, Treasury
tBearer Bonds.  He fans them out, eyes drinking from his
tGrail.
<b>t
</b><b>tBANG!
</b><b>t
</b>tA gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds, setting it
taflame before it SLAMS into the far wall, sending up a little
tcloud of plaster dust.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b><b>t          JESUS!
</b><b>t
</b>tHe whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall,
tgun extended.
<b>t
</b>tBut Raoul is standing just above the hole, and already has
this boot raised, over the hand.  He brings it down, a
tCRUNCHING blow that stomps right on Meg's wrist.
<b>t
</b>tMeg SCREAMS, loses her grip on the gun, and it CLATTERS into
tthe space between the houses.
<b>t
</b><b>tBETWEEN THE WALLS,
</b><b>t
</b>tthe gun falls into oblivion, the space between the walls,
twhere no one can get to it.
<b>t
</b><b>tIN THE PANIC ROOM,
</b><b>t
</b>tBurnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b><b>t          I GOT THE MONEY, LET'S GO!!!
</b><b>t
</b>tRaoul grabs Sarah and turns, jabs the green button to open
tthe door.
<b>t
</b>tBehind them, Meg SCREAMS in anger and wriggles through the
topening.  Before she's even all the way through, she gets
thold of Raoul's leg and pulls herself into the panic room,
tscraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the too-small
thole.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b><b>t          GO, LET'S GO, OUTTA HERE!!
</b><b>t
</b>tBut Raoul is deep in a violent rage.  Still holding Sarah
twith one hand, he bends down, grabs Meg by the hair, and
tdrags her toward the doorway.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     RAOUL
</b><b>t          YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
</b><b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b><b>t          FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
</b><b>t
</b>tHe bolts out of the room, through the metal door, which is
tjust finishing its slow crank open, its heavy spring coiling
tin the wall.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul drag Meg across the floor by the hair, right into the
ttrack of the open steel door.
<b>t
</b>tShe looks up, sees the infrared safety beam over her head,
tand  realizes with horror what his intention is.
<b>t
</b>tStill with one arm holding Sarah, who is kicking and
tstruggling viciously, Raoul holds Meg's head down on the
tfloor, below the safety beam that would prevent the door from
tclosing.  He reaches for the "close" button.
<b>t
</b>tSarah raises her arm, stuffed with three syringes, and jabs
tthem into Raoul's neck.  Raoul SCREAMS in pain.
<b>t
</b>tMeg manages to raise her head, breaking the beam.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tOn the stairwell, Burnham, stops, frozen, his face twitching
twith indecision.  He hears the murder taking place just above
thim.
<b>t
</b>tHe runs down three steps.
<b>t
</b>tStops again.
<b>t
</b>tRuns down the rest of the stairs.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tRaoul stretches to push the red "close" button for the door,
tbut he has to hold Meg's head down, out of the lower beam
twith one hand, all with Sarah savagely attacking him at the
tsame time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck.
<b>t
</b>tFinally, he gets Meg's head all the way down, onto the floor.
<b>t
</b>tLooking up, Meg sees the red beam become complete again.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul jabs the button --
<b>t
</b>t-- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one
tat shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is
tbroken, the door will not close.
<b>t
</b>tRaoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah
tflying across the room.
<b>t
</b>tMeg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the
tbeam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over
tagain, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then
tbreaks, never the button and the beam at the same time.
<b>t
</b>tBut it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it
tup, her head trembles --
<b>t
</b>t-- and collapses onto the floor.
<b>t
</b>tThe beam completes --
<b>t
</b>t-- Raoul SMACKS the red button --
<b>t
</b>t-- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He
treaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but
tRaoul loses his balance, falls forward --
<b>t
</b>t-- into the gap --
<b>t
</b>t-- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door
tthat SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back.
<b>t
</b>tMeg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on
ttight.
<b>t
</b>tThe door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly.
tRaoul's body slumps to the floor, dead.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah.
<b>t
</b>tThey stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face
tcontact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket.
<b>t
</b>tShe just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here.
<b>t
</b>tHe zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
</b><b>t
</b>tBurnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door,
tthrows it open --
<b>t
</b>t-- and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose.  He
tblinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that
tgun.
<b>t
</b>tIt's the Cop, the first Cop, the one who came to the door and
twas so suspicious of Meg.  The Cop looks down, sees blood
tsmeared all over Burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to
tknow his suspicions were correct.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     COP 1
</b>t          Put your hands up.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway.  Wind and leaves
tblow into the house, a real gale outside.
<b>t
</b>tFrom behind Cop 1, MORE COPS SHOUT, all at once, must be a
thalf dozen of 'em there, but Burnham can't see anything in
tthe stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the
tROARING wind.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the
tCop's face.  The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but
tdoesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS
tCRACK through the door behind him.
<b>t
</b>tBrilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the
tdoor, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks
tof lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his
tchest, a triangle pattern.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his
tjacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds.
<b>t
</b>tHe fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like
tplaying cards.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     BURNHAM
</b>t          Monster hand.
<b>t
</b>tBehind him, the front door CRACKS open, half a dozen COPS
tappear and start SHOUTING, all at once.  Burnham tosses the
tbonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of
tpoker.
<b>t
</b>tHe GROANS and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds,
ttwisting as he goes down.  He SLAPS onto his back in the
tfoyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the
tbonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house,
tas if they were never meant to leave.
<b>t
</b>tBurnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the
tceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air,
tsuspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over
this head as he dies.
<b>t
</b><b>t                                             DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT.  CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tThe swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the
tair over Central Park on a crisp fall day.  The leaves float
tdown, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we
tsaw in Meg's hallucination.
<b>t
</b>tBut on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people,
tthrowing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing
tnothing.
<b>t
</b>tThe leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched
tout on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open
tto the ads.
<b>t
</b>tMeg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up
tat the clouds.
<b>t
</b>tSarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.
<b>t
</b><b>t                     SARAH
</b>t          I mean, uptown is close to Dad's
t          place, but somebody at school said
t          the Village is really cool, so... I
t          don't know, it's so great to be
t          close to the park and everything...
t          What do you think, I mean, give me a
t          clue, here, where are we gonna live?
<b>t
</b>tMeg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow.  She seems
tyears younger.  She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her
tdaughter's hair behind one ear.
<b>t
</b>tShe smiles.  She is calm.
<b>t
</b>tBehind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the
tclear autumn sky.
<b>t
</b><b>t                                                FADE OUT.
