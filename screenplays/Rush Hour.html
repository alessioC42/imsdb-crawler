<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT.  LOS ANGELES - DAY
</b>
The whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the
summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and
wake me up.

<b>EXT.  LAX - DAY
</b>
The traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly
with stretch limousines.

<b>INT.  LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY
</b>
Inside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers
and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit

A planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the
crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of
Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears.

They get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER:

<b>ttttREPORTER
</b>ttt(to TV CAMERA)
ttEager to mend its tarnished image,
ttLos Angeles has really put out the
ttwelcome mat for tomorrow's summit.
ttThe city promises quite a party as
ttleaders from Japan, China, South
ttKorea, Australia, the U.S. and
ttothers begin talks for the largest
ttfree-trade treaty in history.

The SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries
arriving.

Then, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city.

<b>ttttREPORTER (VO)
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThe one sour note is North Korea,
ttthe only Pacific Rim country not
ttparticipating. There are rumors of
ttsecret meetings with North Korean
ttrepresentatives, but U.S. officials
ttinsist the North must first hold
ttdemocratic elections, and halt its
ttnuclear weapons program -- as they
ttclaimed to have done back in 1995.

We CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL.

Then ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ.

The SCENE returns to LAX.

<b>ttttREPORTER (VO)
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttTensions remain high since last
ttyear's skirmishes between North Korea
ttand the U.S. So any chance of the
ttcommunist North joining the Pacific
ttPartners seems highly unlikely.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY
</b>
An exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only
one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire.

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought-
iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean,
next to the entranceway:
<b>     
</b>ttttConsulate
tttt of the
ttDemocratic People's Republic of Korea

The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted
windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
An alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS.
He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.

<b>EXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY
</b>
From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars
overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.

<b>HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS
</b>
as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy
hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see
his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.

Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription
bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to
a van with a phone company logo on it.



<b>EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY
</b>
The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns
into the heavy morning traffic.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows
and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.

The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside
him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.

A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and
turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and
sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged
Scandinavian GOVERNESS.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI can't stand it -- half an hour to
ttget to the stupid school every
ttmorning... with no music...
ttt(Korean; subtitled)
tt[Just our damn Nanny...]

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It
follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He
glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE
UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.

<b>EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto
the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.

The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings
as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.
The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts
on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.



<b>EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a
procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass
arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a
switch on his radio-control unit...

<b>CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS
</b>
Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps
on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds
of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,
scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...

<b>WIDER
</b>
Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most
hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction
PILE-UP you can imagine.

Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe
their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some
fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still
coming onto the overpass.

Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,
glass shatters.

And then it gets really nasty...

A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The
truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.

It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...

Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept
over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.

They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver
slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttt(Korean)
tt[Stay in the car.]



<b>EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
</b>
A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The
Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.

<b>INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY
</b>
Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He
slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.

<b>ANGLE WITH JAVAL
</b>
as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and
rolls under the Mercedes.

The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - DAY
</b>
Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as
police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP
motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
</b>
Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks
another radio unit. Working.

<b>EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
</b>
The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and
traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,
Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the
Mercedes onto the 405 south.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio
unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.

Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...

But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.

<b>INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES
</b>
Javal's device is armed, and waiting...

<b>tttttttFADE TO:
</b>


<b>EXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-
family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.

Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has
a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the
signs, they've been there for quite a while.

<b>INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.

PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering
him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.

Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,
muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.

Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes
above all else that one should never raise one's voice.

Carson groans... he's DREAMING...

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY
</b>
Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.
Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.

Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK
across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in
his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.

Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the
bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttSon of a bitch!

He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped
bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttPete... please... we have to be up
ttearly tomorrow. Call the police.



<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttYeah, right.

He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,
its LCD reading "ARMED."

He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.
Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door
open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttShit!

<b>MIRANDA
</b>
pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttNot again...

<b>EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by
the streetlight --

Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang
convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've
made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.

Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying
the ignition switch out of the dashboard.

Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a
crowbar. His partner keeps working.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the
crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.

Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.

Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto
the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.

As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.

Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.

Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.

Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off
toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --

And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.

Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.

Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A
WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble
with their sidearms.

<b>ttttWESTEC GUARD
</b>ttEverybody... chill! Bikini boy! On
ttthe ground!

Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the
screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttAsshole was trying to boost my car!

<b>ANGLE ACROSS STREET
</b>
Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas
and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttMike -- call 911!

<b>ttttNEIGHBOR
</b>ttBeen trying...
ttt(has a cordless phone)
ttIt's busy.
ttt(to Guards; re Carson)
ttHe's the good guy, you schumcks.

The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a
TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.

<b>CLOSER
</b>
Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He
notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray-
painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His
Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?

The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right
under the gushing SPRINKLER.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttI hate this fuckin' town.

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
</b>
<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into
the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the
cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.

<b>ttttJOY
</b>ttThere are six bathrooms in this
tthouse, Sam.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(fanning the air)
ttBut only one with a smoking section.

She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are
having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.

Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquxc8s.
He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's
dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.

Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her
husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a
summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.

Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the
"Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.

<b>ttttAMBASSADOR HAN
</b>ttt(Korean)
tt[Go change.]

Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.

<b>ttttAMBASSADOR HAN
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt[You smell like a fireplace.]

A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.

<b>ttttMRS. HAN
</b>ttIt's the Governess...
ttt(into phone)
ttHello, Hilda...

<b>CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS
</b>
as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous.
We cannot see her surroundings.

<b>ttttGOVERNESS
</b>ttt(thru phone)
ttMrs. Han... I am very sick today...

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>ttttMRS. HAN
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttWe will see you next week...
ttt(hangs up; smiles to kids)
ttIt appears I'll be taking you to
ttschool.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
</b>
In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.

<b>ttttJAVAL
</b>ttVery good. You may go now...

He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an
orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a
quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.

Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'
upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a
gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.

He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a
small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.

<b>INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling
off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an
exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading
the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.

<b>ANGLE ON TV
</b>
A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to
us from a local NEWS COPTER.



<b>ttttBOBBI
</b>ttt(on TV)
tt...Good morning, Summit Day! It's
ttgonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of
ttJuly, the Olympics and Woodstock all
ttrolled into one! All over town
ttthere'll be parades, concerts,
ttrallies, festivals... So get out
ttthere everyone, but plan your drive-
tttime accordingly! This is Bobbi
ttMarchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...

We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about
to board a helicopter.

<b>ttttMORNING ANCHOR (VO)
</b>ttt(on TV)
ttThe President is on his way...

<b>ttttPRESIDENT
</b>ttt(on TV)
tt...It's an honor hosting my fellow
ttleaders in Los Angeles, the capitol
ttcity of the Pacific Rim...

We CUT BACK to the studio and the MORNING ANCHOR.

<b>ttttMORNING ANCHOR
</b>ttt(on TV)
ttWe'll see the menu for Mayor
ttSimpson's Brentwood barbecue, right
ttafter this...

We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events
around town.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttI was watching that.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttIf I hear one more Beach Boys song,
ttI'll shoot myself.

Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing; while smiling)
ttI said, if we were having sex once in
tta while, you wouldn't need to ride
ttthat fucking bike every morning.



<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttt(hasn't heard a thing)
ttBe right with you...

As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's
nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los
Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them.

Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines
about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington;
Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."

<b>INT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,
is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and
wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some
sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.

Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak
and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast
and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttt(looks him over)
ttHave you gotten any sleep lately?

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(ignores the question)
ttShop's gonna tow the car in --
ttgoddamn ignition's trashed.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttTake mine. I'll ride in with Diane.

Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the
rose bushes.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttYou ask me, those suckers are a lost
ttcause.

She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttIt's not for you.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttYou mean it's not for you.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttI don't chase car thieves in my
ttunderwear. C'mon, you'd die of
ttboredom if we ever sold this house
ttand moved.



<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttI'd die of shock, from finding
ttanyone dumb enough to buy the place.
ttEven for what it's worth now.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttLots of people bought at the top of
ttthe market...

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttThat sure cheers me right up.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttI don't know why we even talk about
ttit. The city's not the problem. So
ttwe move. It wouldn't matter. What's
ttthat saying: "Wherever you go, there
ttyou are."

Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces
from the cut in his side.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI hope you're current on your
tttetanus booster. Was it worth it?

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttOne cut... two assholes in the
tthospital... Yep.

Carson glances at his watch and gets up.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWell, another day of baby-sitting my
ttfavorite bunch of people...

He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,
9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttAsk for a transfer.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttThey're not gonna transfer me. You
ttknow damn well why I was bumped down
ttto guard duty...
ttt(as he's leaving)
ttMy outstanding people skills.

Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she
sadly watches him go.



<b>EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some
YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus.

He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street.
He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.

The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch
sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttI hate this fuckin' town.

Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960.

As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle
and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy
bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the
Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside.

Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt
<b>SWEARING:
</b>
<b>ttttANGRY VOICE (OS)
</b>ttGoddamn Limey overpriced piece a
ttshit...

<b>THEIR POV
</b>
In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit
has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible.
The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in
the car with her schoolbooks in her lap.

<b>JOY
</b>
turns to Mrs. Han:

<b>ttttJOY
</b>ttCan we give Lisa a ride?

<b>INT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY
</b>
It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is
still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.

<b>ttttLISA
</b>ttHey, Joy... Sam...

Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.



<b>ttttLISA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttExcellent -- I can't hear him!

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttt(raps on window)
ttThe glass is an inch thick.

ttStarts, too.

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's
van begins following it.

<b>INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES
</b>
where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one
just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.

DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets
out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.

He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE,
(45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the
outside world, with profound contempt.

Dave, attachxc8 case in one hand and notebook computer in the
other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far
corner of the property, just outside the high fence.

<b>INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of
communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee.

Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather
their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and
SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female).

The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his
other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning
yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.

Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a
bag of oranges walks from car to car.

Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until
his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY
</b>
The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver
glances in the rear-view:

There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY
in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.

The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side
window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts.
They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP
OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.

Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - SAME
</b>
Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.



<b>INSERT
</b>
Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to
emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - DAY
</b>
The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone
inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver
grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.

Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of
his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.

He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun
muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it
is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge
cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.

The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his
machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of
BURNING magnesium shrapnel.

<b>WIDER
</b>
The other drivers in the intersection see this and go
completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards.
Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.

The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the
floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.

Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs.
Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away.
Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.

He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points
the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices
Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.

He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over
his dashboard to get a look at the action.

Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another
bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the
entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.

Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm
and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.



<b>ttttJAVAL
</b>ttYou see that I'm serious in my
ttintention, yes?
ttt(she nods)
ttIf you cooperate, you and your
ttchildren will be home for dinner
tttonight.

He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the
kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
</b>
He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on
both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs.
Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs
the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of
Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other
handcuff to Lisa.

Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the
Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground.

His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a
small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.

<b>ttttCOLONEL LEE
</b>ttt(Korean; to Ambassador Han)
tt[You must stay here.]

Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:

<b>ttttAMBASSADOR HAN
</b>ttSomeone took my family!

The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car
SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.



<b>ttttSABATINI
</b>ttYou got no jurisdiction outside
ttthis property!

Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber
pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.

<b>ttttSABATINI
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttShit!
ttt(to Ambassador Han)
ttYank his fuckin' leash!

Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost
running Sabatini over.

<b>ttttAMBASSADOR HAN
</b>ttt(continuing; to Sabatini)
ttIt's a white telephone van, driving
ttwest on Washington Boulevard.

The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government
Dodge is blocking theirs.

<b>ttttROBBINS
</b>ttKeys!

Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the
back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.

<b>ttttSABATINI
</b>ttYou're ridin' shotgun.

Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.

</b>
Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate,
Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.

<b>INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He
fishtails, making a U-turn.

He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them.
All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way.

He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:

<b>ttttSABATINI
</b>ttSomeone snatched Han's family! White
ttphone van, westbound on Washington!

Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttGive me a secure radio!

Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her
pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it
in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-
shit Dodge, trying to keep up.

Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his
office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good-
looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by
virtue of his quiet competence.

A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his
eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.

Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government-
issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo.



<b>JAVAL
</b>
grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.

</b>
Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with
the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on
the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under
the plastic tarp it's wrapped in.

Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it.

Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a
deafening round through the roof of the van.

<b>ttttJAVAL
</b>ttI need to concentrate!

<b>EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY
</b>
During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across
the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on
its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket...

Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a
vial of crack.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the
FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the
ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.

<b>EXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY
</b>
Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down
apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a
one-block lead on Carson and the others.

Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors
on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up.

Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an
empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the
same direction as Javal is driving.

Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and
then quickly backs up into the garage.

<b>INT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
</b>
As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards
into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the
rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap-
buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.

Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging
from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door
from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.

Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly-
constructed remotes:

<b>INT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.

A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine;

Engage the transmission;

And supply fuel to the carburetor.

<b>EXT.  ALLEYWAYS
</b>
The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up
to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley
behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.

The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main
road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The
duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and
the rear walls of buildings...

ttHe's gonna wrap it around something!

<b>EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY
</b>
Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to
avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.

Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the
alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.

<b>ttttCARSON (OS)
</b>ttOh, shit...

The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES.



<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini
run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van.
Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.

Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.

<b>ttttCOLONEL LEE
</b>ttYou should not have interfered!

Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttI'm in no mood...

Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to
oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.

<b>ttttROBBINS
</b>ttForget about him!

By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and
whites and helicopters converge on the area.

<b>EXT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY
</b>
A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something
eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming
from a loudspeaker.

Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The
superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look
like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.

<b>EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY
</b>
The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So,
accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley
in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.

Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

Off their perplexed looks, we

<b>INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and
peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a
toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.

In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs,
side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers
two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.

The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid
with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them
and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt
and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to
the moon... and it terrifies her.

<b>ttttJAVAL
</b>ttDoes anyone need to use the rest
ttroom? This will be your last
ttopportunity for a few hours.

ttVery well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy,

ttt(indicates the Lazy Boys;
tttthen turns to Lisa)
ttAnd you... what is your name?

<b>ttttLISA
</b>ttt(after a beat)
ttLisa...

Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the
closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:

<b>ttttJAVAL
</b>ttNo, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.

He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries
to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.

<b>ttttJAVAL
</b>ttt(continuing; sotto)
ttYou afford me some additional
ttbargaining power. But not much.

She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator.
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.

He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with
three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.

We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs
up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a
green light and the meters come to life.

<b>ttttJAVAL
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThere. No taping your mouths, no

She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.

<b>ttttMRS. HAN
</b>ttt(continuing; softly)
ttWhat happens if the circuit closes?

<b>ttttJAVAL
</b>ttKaboom...

He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of
C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into
it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.

<b>ttttJAVAL
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttEasy... deep breath...
ttt(to the kids)
ttDo each of you understand?

They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.

<b>ttttJAVAL
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttKeep your wits, and all will be fine.

He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He
then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere.

<b>ttttCOMMENTATOR #1

tt...Not since the '84 Olympics has the

Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts
pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.

Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal
turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts
light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other
is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.

Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles

In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly-

Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an
aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA
sits up front and listens passively.

An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out
the door.

its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING...

After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it
into a false bottom in his attachxc8 case. He disappears just
before a GUARD rounds the corner.

She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS
into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when
it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags
into two larger bags.

Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in
between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized
space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife.

He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson
checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.

And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money

<b>WIDER
</b>
When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another
mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.



<b>EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
</b>
Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then
jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets
into the southbound lanes.

He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttJust don't kill yourself, you piece
ttof shit...

Carson fishes out his two-way.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing; into radio)
ttHelicopter or two would be nice!

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttt(into radio)
ttLove to be in the loop on this...

<b>EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
</b>
Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(to himself)
ttNot just now, dear...

Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli
shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his
arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST
crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the
front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-
deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue
shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing; grumbling)
ttI coulda had a ranch... maybe some
tthorses... but no, we moved to L.A.

<b>JAVAL
</b>
speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs
for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun.

A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him.

Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a
right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.

<b>EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY
</b>
Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside
neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is
covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He
HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He
can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,
outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story
concrete tower.

He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.

Javal comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.

<b>ANGLE WITH CARSON
</b>
as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,
abandoned, lying on its side...

And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.

Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end
of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is
hanging through the broken window.

Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of
the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(into radio)
ttHe's on foot, at the base of the
ttelevator tower!

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...



<b>EXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY
</b>
Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her
garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.

<b>EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY
</b>
Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(into radio)
ttGoddammit! He's in a blue Geo!

<b>EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
</b>
In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way
through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.

Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.

On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini
and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as
they all try to catch up to Javal.

The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill
below Franklin.

<b>EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY
</b>
Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting
him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.

Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.

Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.
It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.

Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.

Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.

Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!

<b>INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the
helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with
one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.

<b>EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY
</b>
Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.
It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then
it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.

Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners
SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself
against the inside of the Geo's roof.

Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly
too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.

<b>INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to
set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.

The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible
to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...

<b>EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY
</b>
The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol
Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.

The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's
heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the
bottom of the hill.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the
glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.

<b>EXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY
</b>
The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12
floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor
shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like
backwash.

The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.

<b>CLOSER
</b>
From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.

The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with
fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out.

<b>ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW
</b>
In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...
anything to get away from the area below the impact.



<b>JAVAL
</b>
reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door.

He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS
again... he loses his grip...

And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.

We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...

Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his
chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.

<b>EXT.  VINE AND SUNSET - DAY
</b>
Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering
copter and Geo are right above it.

Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the
parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...

Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.

Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.

With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away
from the building.

Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the
street, diving for cover behind a car.

<b>BEHIND CARSON
</b>
the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.
He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttFingerprint it.
ttt(to Walther)
ttHe's not gonna tell us where to find
ttthe hostages...

ttttCARSON (Cont'd)

ttMiranda! We need a copter, pronto!
ttt(to Robbins)
ttGet back to his van. There were no
ttplates, but check the VIN, look it
ttover, then meet us at the Consulate.

Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttGo!

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini,
Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(to Walther)
tt...Scrounge us some bodies: National

</b>ttLook, I don't need you to tell me
tthow fucked we are!

<b>ttttWALTHER
</b>ttFuck you!! Every time you're on a

Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttStop! The clock's running! Arguing
ttis a luxury we can't afford!
tttt-more-

ttttMIRANDA (Cont'd)
ttt(looks at Carson)
ttWhat's done is done. There'll be
ttplenty of time to point fingers
ttlater.

Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He
looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.

<b>ttttSABATINI
</b>ttI need some fuckin' ink!!

Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's
desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.

In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers
and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.

<b>ttttAMBASSADOR HAN
</b>ttThis is impossible! How can you even
ttbegin to find them?

Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttWell, the normal procedure is to
ttnegotiate with the perpetrator...

Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttLet's take stock. We've got a picture
ttof where he hid the family, and
ttrecordings of his calls --

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>tt-- That's right! We can send them to
ttour experts for analysis...

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(to Ambassador Han)
ttSame with his fingerprints. But that
ttmeans we need high-quality image and

ttten minutes coptering this shit to

ttuse your surveillance equipment.

<b>ttttCOLONEL LEE
</b>ttThere is no surveillance equipment.
ttThis is a diplomatic facility --

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>tt-- You want to play games, fine.

He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.



<b>ttttAMBASSADOR HAN
</b>ttTake them upstairs.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS
monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote
wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc.
Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is
hardly cutting-edge technology.

Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are
surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow.
Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttSouth Korean Consulate's just down
ttthe street -- want to take a listen?

Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him.

Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The
Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing; re hand)
ttShitcan that thing, will you?!

She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a
wastepaper basket.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing; to Colonel Lee)
ttGot a digital scanner?

<b>ttttCOLONEL LEE
</b>ttAnalog.

<b>ttttDAVE (VO)

He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit
by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.



<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttt(to Colonel Lee)
ttColonel, you saw the perp. Describe
tthim to the Ambassador, see if it's
ttanyone he knows.

Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.

Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly
SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.

The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the

Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.

Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from

He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the
microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing...

He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with
a small piece of the gum.

And his meter drops to zero.

Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he
can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while
keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his
hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other...

He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it.

Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the
red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash...

Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half,
and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy.

Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her
mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some
hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the
Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO...

until he finds the reason for the jam-up:

Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment
trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and
gawkers. A MOVIE SHOOT. Carson groans.

He hurries back to the Lexus. Miranda rolls her window down.

Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d,
but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out
his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is
ajar... He pushes it open...

And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles.

The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10"
on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out.

Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward
apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing.

He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly
unlocks the door.

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY
</b>
The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark.

As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize
there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not
alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN.

The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs
for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttWhat the fuck..!

Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and
shows them her FBI shield.

</b>ttSorry...

Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot-
wide, ornamental balcony.

</b>ttt(to Miranda)
ttWait here.

She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.

<b>EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY
</b>
The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as
Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the
curtains into the window of Javal's apartment.

He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the
bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty...
the balcony SLIPS a little...

He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's
empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the
pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline.

Carson cautiously goes into the living room --

It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes,
and three flower pots in macramxc8 ceiling hangers by the living
room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.

Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.

Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.

Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.

He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the
deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...

He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a
piece was cut, then neatly replaced.

Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining
NOISE coming from the kitchen.

He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green
refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for
booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.

Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the
bottom of his shoe.

Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the
floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants:
two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.

We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b><b>ttNO! --
</b>
Too late... The front door opens....

Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...

As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it
spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.

Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.



<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the
tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.

Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is
covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.

Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and
tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final
BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...

And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttI said keep everyone back!!

He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against
the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.

Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.

A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he
holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and
CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding
a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.

The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.

Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed
to protect themselves...

The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.

Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in
the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...

Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.

Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.

Time stands still.

Realization.

Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for
the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.

Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.

Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.

The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North

Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor,
while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.

Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.

Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.

Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda.
Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.

Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his
notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.

Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet
hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open.
She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is
mushroomed against the vest.

She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him.
Carson is overwhelmed with relief.

Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against
the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.

Carson hurries to catch up to it...

Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the
driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents
through the passenger's side.

The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION
actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air.

The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing
a portion of it.

Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning
wreckage.

As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to
allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through.

Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel
Lee STRAFES the Volvo.

Carson looks up just in time to see...

A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder.

Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo
CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck.

The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han
from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat:

Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece
of the seat harness, then slides the door open.

He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He
breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.

white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter...

<b>INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the
copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket.

The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS
the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor.

Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth
Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.

Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of
the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee
SLASHES at Carson with a knife.

Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper
arm. Carson falls backwards.

Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly,
someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over.

It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying.

Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists.
Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free...

coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter.

<b>ttttJOY
</b>ttMother... Sam...

They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han
understands... She hesitates, then:

<b>ttttMRS. HAN
</b>ttDo it.

Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her
foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's
sitting closest to the window.

With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter,
sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.

<b>INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the
Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door
to the inner office and rush in.

<b>ttttMILTON
</b>ttIt's a brown binder... Says "Rental
ttManifest." You can't miss it...

They literally tear the office apart.

<b>INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
The FIRE is consuming the curtains. Thick, toxic SMOKE begins
to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing.

<b>INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
They circle, overwhelmed by the sheer number of apartments.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(into radio)
ttApartment number would be real
tthelpful, gang...

Miranda points to a wisp of SMOKE above one of the towers.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttThere!

They come around, and spot the FIRE in the apartment's window.
It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor.

<b>EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY
</b>
The coast looms closer.

<b>EXT.  PARK LA BREA - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY
</b>
The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away.
Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...

Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick,
iron balcony railing.

Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly
across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig
9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass
door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

<b>INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun
to creep across the floor and the ceiling.

Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM.

The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.

In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her
mouth. She's freaking out.

Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off.
She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttOkay... work with me here!

He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it
won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.

<b>ttttLISA
</b>ttHurry, please hurry...

Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set
handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and
the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.

Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.

Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed
hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs
for the front door. Just as she reaches it:

<b>ttttCARSON
</b><b>ttDON'T!
</b>
He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small
magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWe have to go out the window.

<b>ttttMRS. HAN
</b>ttCan't you disarm the bomb?



<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttToo risky. Let's concentrate on
ttgetting you out of here.

He looks at the meters on the electronic units.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttSound detectors?

<b>ttttMRS. HAN
</b>ttSam covered them with chewing gum.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttHigh-tech problem, low-tech solution.

Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttPressure sensors. Use 'em in
ttconvertibles: Bad guy sits on your
ttseat, he sets the alarm off. These
ttare rigged backwards -- get up, you
ttset 'em off.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYou a bomb expert?

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttNope. But I've had some car alarms
ttin my day.
ttt(to himself)
ttFor all the goddamn good they do...

Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape
on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing; to Mrs. Han)
ttSlide your arm forward... Watch the
ttmeter... Keep the pressure on the
ttarmrest with your elbow...

He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIt'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate
ttthe weight of your arm... Okay...
ttpick it up.

They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.

The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs
with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.



<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(continuing; to Sam)
ttLow-tech solution...
ttt(to Mrs. Han)
ttLean back... Carefully.

Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried
under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around
the seat and wraps it tightly.

He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.

<b>ttttMIRANDA (VO)
</b>ttt(thru radio in his pocket)
ttHow's it going in there?

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(to himself)
ttNag, nag, nag...

He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries
again to lift her. This time it works!

The missile has almost reached land.

</b>
Time: 4:58. The Apache helicopter HOVERING outside is making
an incredible racket.

Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands,
the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone
head begin to PULL the gum away!

Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow
warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm.

Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.

<b>WIDER
</b>
The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is
hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa
into the rescue harness. She's terrified.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttYou'll be over in five seconds...

She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the
harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so
his sister can go.

<b>ANGLE ON BOMB
</b>
One minute... fifty-nine seconds...

<b>CARSON
</b>
sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs.
Han into it...

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttTell 'em I'm gonna release the hook
ttand ride down on the line.

He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to
the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook.

<b>ANGLE ON BOMB
</b>
Thirty seconds... twenty-nine...

<b>THE HARNESS
</b>
slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and
tries to undo the hook buckle with the other...

But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he
can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the
hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.

Fifteen seconds to go...

Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(shouts)
ttRelease the cable from your side!
ttGet out of here!

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttt(shouts back)
ttCome over the railing! Grab onto the

Miranda turns to the Pilot.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttTear the hook loose!

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttTry it anyway!

Five seconds to go...

The Apache helicopter backs away from the high-rise...

The cable pulls taut...

Carson wraps the webbing of the harness around his wrist...

The Apache STRAINS against the resistance of the cable...

The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson
HANGING on the harness next to it...

The helicopter turns and flies away...

<b>EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY
</b>
The bomb EXPLODES, blasting a huge hole in the tower.

All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments IMPLODE.

<b>CARSON
</b>
is engulfed in the FIREBALL... We can't tell if he's alive.

<b>INT./EXT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot
fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down.

<b>BELOW
</b>
Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down.

Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter
swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast.

Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear
as the helicopter lands.

Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him...

<b>WIDER
</b>
Dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air;
helicopters crisscross the scene.

Everyone turns their eyes skyward, looking for the missile...

The Premier and the High Command are watching the action at
Park LaBrea on CNN Live...

...As Ambassador Han embraces his family.

Furious, General Kai gets up and leaves the conference room.

The others look at the Premier. After a beat, he crosses to a
PANEL OF ELECTRONICS and SLAPS a large red button on it...

<b>EXT.  SKY ABOVE SANTA MONICA - DAY

The cruise missile EXPLODES, completely obliterating it.

The lead jet cuts away, turning around. The others follow.

<b>EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The Han family crosses to Carson, blackened and bloody,
sitting on the curb next to Miranda. Ambassador Han shakes
his hand. Mrs. Han and Miranda cry. Joy and Sam grin at him.
After a beat, Carson gathers the kids up in his arms. It is a
profound catharsis for him...

<b>EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YxdaNGYANG - DAY

General Kai is getting into his car. He look up as an ARMY
OFFICER approaches... and SHOOTS him! The Officer pushes his
body into the passenger's seat, gets in, and drives off.

A beautiful ranch house and horse barn, sitting on a meadow
beside a brook, overlooking an unspoiled pine forest.

The pastoral scene is a COMMERCIAL on the TV.

Carson, wrapped in a towel, holds the phone and paces.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttt(into phone)
tt...I'll call you next week.

Carson hangs up, and CLICKS off the TV as he leaves the room.
The sound of RUNNING WATER continues (OS)...

<b>EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO - NIGHT

Miranda, wearing a bathrobe, is WATERING her sickly roses.
Carson comes outside.

ttt(beat)
ttThey want me back on the hostage
ttteam.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttWhat did you say?

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttTold 'em I'd sleep on it...

Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches
down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes. They
work in silence. Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses
him. Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight...

<b>INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing:

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttWorking with you today was
ttcertainly... interesting, Inspector.

<b>ttttCARSON
</b>ttIt's my outstanding people skills.

He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is
a tender, romantic moment...

Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up.

<b>ttttMIRANDA
</b>ttI hate this fucking town...

Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes
her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.

All of the books and magazines about other places to live
spill from his nightstand, onto the floor...
