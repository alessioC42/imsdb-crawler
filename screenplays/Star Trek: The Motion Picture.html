t      The CAMERA HOLDS just a moment, then MOVES on, SEARCH-

t      systems, sparkling nebulae, swirling hydrogen clouds.
t      STILL MOVING, then CAMERA FINDS:

t      In the far distance, slowly growing in size as CAMERA
t      APPROACHES: it resembles, vaguely at this distance, an
t      Aurora Borealis: flaring colors from the fringes,
t      beautiful yet ominous. It is so large, this Cloud, it
t      can envelope an entire solar system. CAMERA CONTINUES

t      Out of the LUMINESCENCE hurtles a FRIGHTENING WHIPLASH
t      OF ENERGY. It bears down on the Klingon Patrol, now
t      in an evasive maneuver. Then the WHIPLASH BOLT hits
t      the third cruiser in a writhing flare of energy which
t      totally engulfs the vessel.

t      The other two ships veer off, warping around again into
t      attack position. The THIRD SHIP has begun to implode
t      in on itself, the matter-energy of its existence
t      drained by the WHIPLASH BOLT that HOLDS IT.

<b>t 27   CLOSE ON THE MAIN MONITOR STATION (O)                       27
</b>
t      as its focal point shifts to the huge elliptically-
t      shaped LUMINESCENCE racing across the sky. MUSIC
t      (V'GER THEME) COMMENCES in a low, unresolved CHORD
t      that remains in the background through the remainder
t      of this scene, and the beginning of the next one.

</b>t                Sir, it's on a precise heading
t                for Earth.

t      Ominously now the LUMINESCENCE increases in size, and
t      begins to fill the viewer. HOLD A MOMENT, and then:

<b>t 28   EXT. SURFACE OF PLANET VULCAN - DAY (M)                     28
</b>
t      with the CAMERA MOVING THROUGH masses of thick, steamy
t      vaporous clouds, swirling about, rising boilingly up
t      from some unseen, underground source. The CAMERA
t      CONTINUES MOVING through clouds.

t      And then... the Vulcan landscape. Harsh, strange
t      angular peaks and rock formations -- the barren, legend-
t      ary mountain home of Vulcan Masters.

<b>t 29   EXT. VULCAN LEDGE - SPOCK ( M & F.P.)                       29
</b>
t      Spock's lean features instantly recognizable despite
t      unkempt, longer hair and the fatigue born of a long,
t      harsh discipline he has undergone. His robes, tattered
t      and dust covered, are that of a Vulcan Aspirant in
t      study with the Masters. Under the V'ger THEME MUSIC
t      we HEAR a VOICE in ritual tones:

<b>t                              FEMALE MASTER'S VOICE
</b>t                Spock, son of Sarek of Vulcan...

t      In b.g., gigantic ancient Vulcan statues and ruins. In f.g., 
t      the stone platform on which Spock stands facing a semi-circle 
t      of three similar platforms. On them in regal robes are three 
t      VULCAN MASTERS. The Master in the center is a female, the 
t      other two Masters are male. The elderly female is holding a 
t      cord and ancient pendant as if ready to place it around            

<b>    
</b>t      Spock's neck at an appropriate moment. Spock is staring up 
t      as V'ger THEME MUSIC fades.

t                Spock . . . !

t      Spock turns, giving a small contrite nod -- the ritual
t      continues.

<b>t                              FEMALE MASTER
</b>t                Here are these sands, our fore-

t                passions. Here our race was 
t                saved by the first attainment of 
t                Kolinahr.
<b>t             
</b><b>t                              MALE MASTER

<b>t                              FEMALE MASTER

t                Now receive from us this symbol
t                of total logic.

t      Spock starts to kneel... the Female Master moves in,
t      intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck. 
t      But Spock now hesitates -- he's troubled as though 
t      uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the 
t      pendant away. Then, a faint reprise of the V'ger THEME 
t      MUSIC now causes the Female Master to look skyward. 
t      She turns from this back to Spock as she exchanges a 
t      look with the Male Masters.               

<b>t                              FEMALE MASTER

t                Come, give me your thoughts.

t      She kneels with Spock -- lays her hands on his temples 
t      in Vulcan mind-meld position.

<b>t                              FEMALE MASTER
</b>t                        (continuing)
t                Our minds, Spock... One and
t                together....

t      Their eyes close -- their minds meld -- then her head
t      jerks slightly, her features change as her mind feels
t      Spock's reactions to the V'ger consciousness. A long
t      moment, then she opens her eyes, gets to her feet and
t      looks down on the still kneeling Spock. Then, she
t      casts aside the pendant she carries -- it falls into
t      the dust.

<b>t                              FEMALE MASTER

t                You have not achieved Kolinahr --

t                       (turns to the other Masters)
t                He will not achieve his goal with
t                us. His answer lies elsewhere.

t      The three Masters leave -- Spock watches them go, his

t      In the lounge, empty but for them, are Kirk and McCoy
t      -- obviously awaiting Spock, who ENTERS and presents

</b>t      For an instant, it looks like Spock will refuse. Then,

t                logic. I can explain nothing
t                more; I understand nothing more.

t      Kirk is clearly disappointed -- and a bit uncomfortable
t      about what he must ask next. He exchanges a glance

<b>t                              SPOCK

t      Although Spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless,
t      his expression shifts slightly. McCoy indicates this:

t                              McCOY

t                I prefer your poet Dante's phrase
t                -- 'the divine restlessness of
t                the human spirit.'

t                              McCOY
t                Spock... you're quoting poetry?

t      Spock's cold look at McCoy is interrupted by:

<b>t                              UHURA

t                        (to Scott)
t                Shall we give the Enterprise a
t                proper shakedown, Mr. Scott?

t                I'd say it's time for that, I
t                would, sir.
t                        (toward Spock)
t                We can have you back on Vulcan
t                in four days, Mr. Spock.

<b>t                              SPOCK

t                I have no business on Vulcan,
t                Engineer.

t      Kirk and Spock exchange a look -- then Kirk turns to
t      the helm.

<b>t                              KIRK

t                Out there.  Thataway.

t                A most logical choice, Captain.

t      Then the trace of a smile comes over Spock's face.
