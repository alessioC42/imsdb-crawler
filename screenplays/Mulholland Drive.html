<b>EXT.  NIGHT - HOLLYWOOD HILLS, LOS ANGELES
</b><b>    
</b>Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer
sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and
the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree. Then the headlights turn - a
street sign is suddenly brightly lit. The words on the sign
read... "Mulholland Drive." The car moves under the sign as
it turns and the words fall once again into darkness.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT. NIGHT - MULHOLLAND DRIVE
</b><b>    
</b>Gliding we follow the car - an older black Cadillac limousine
- as it winds its way up Mulholland Drive through the
darkness of the Hollywood Hills. There is no one else on the
road. As we drift closer to the car...
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>INT. BLACK CADILLAC LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
</b><b>    
</b>Two men in dark suits are sitting in the front seat. A
beautiful, younger, dark-haired woman sits in back. She sits
close up against the door and stares out into the darkness.
She seems to be thinking about something. Suddenly she turns
and looks ahead. The car is slowing and moving off to the
side of the road.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDARK-HAIRED WOMAN
</b>ttWhat are you doing? You don't stop
tthere ...
<b>    
</b>The car stops - half on, half off the road at a dark, blind
curve. Both men turn to the woman.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttGet out of the car.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT.  FURTHER UP MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
</b><b>    
</b>Two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag
racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the
Cadillac limousine. The cars are filled with crazed
teenagers. Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back.
<b>    
</b>
<b>    
</b>The cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost
float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of
Mulholland Drive.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>INT. EXT. - CADILLAC LIMOUSINE
</b><b>    
</b>The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer
attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out
of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door
handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid.
The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it
is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for
her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes
dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light,
turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice.
The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as
the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into
the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back
toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is
silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above
her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse -
lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across
Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER - NIGHT
</b><b>    
</b>The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants. Sirens can be heard in the distance. She
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her. She screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away -
snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets
up and stumbles through the trees. When she clears them she
is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down
below. She clumsily starts down toward it.
<b>   
</b><b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
</b><b>    
</b>The woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at
Franklin Avenue. A car races by and its headlights flare on
her face. Her expression shows fear and panic. She doesn't
know where she is or where to go. She runs frantically across
the street. She moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her
into a residential area.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
</b><b>    
</b>The woman crosses Sunset Boulevard. Coming up Sunset in the
distance is a police car with its sirens and lights going.
She hurries into the darkness of another residential area. A
car turns onto the street and comes toward her. She
instinctively moves behind a tree until it passes.
<b>  
</b><b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT
</b><b>    
</b>As if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves
desperately down another residential street. A drunken couple
round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward
her. She runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front
of an apartment building. The couple passes by without
noticing her. Feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion
overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep.
<b>   
</b><b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT.  MULHOLLAND DRIVE   - NIGHT
</b><b>    
</b>Police, paramedics surround the wreckage. Two detectives,
HARRY MCKNIGHT and NEAL DOMGAARD (both mid 40's to 50), stare
at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the
crime scene lights. A coroner's van pulls out just after an
ambulance. The ambulance's siren begins to wail as it speeds
off. The coroner's van cruises slowly. Detective Harry
McKnight and Detective Neal Domgaard continue staring. They
do not look at each other. They are each motionless for a
long moment.
<b>  
</b><b>ttttDETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
</b>ttYou feel it?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
</b>ttYeah.
<b>    
</b>They continue to stare.
<b>    
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttDETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD

</b>ttTwo men... two guns in the Caddy.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
</b>ttThe boys found this on the floor in back
ttof the Caddy.
<b>    
</b>Neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
</b>ttYeah, they showed me
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
</b>ttCould be unrelated.

</b>ttCould be...any of those dead kids wearin'

</b><b>ttttDETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD
</b>ttNo. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT
</b>ttThat's what I'm thinkin'.
<b>    
</b>Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland. His
eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each
desert bush just beyond. He slowly raises his gaze to the
shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy.
He looks out and wonders.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - EARLY DAWN
</b><b>    
</b>The clang of a metal gate wakes the woman. It is just getting
light and she sees an older red-headed woman carrying a
suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its
trunk open. The cab driver appears with two suitcases which
he sets down next to the car. The red-headed woman and the
cab driver both go back through the iron gate. The woman in
the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into
the courtyard of this apartment building. She sees the red-
headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come
back out with more luggage.

<b>    
</b>They leave the apartment door open. When the red-headed woman
and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the
bags into the trunk and backseat. Their backs are to the
woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly
into the courtyard and through the open apartment door.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>INT. APARTMENT - EARLY DAWN
</b><b>    
</b>The woman comes into a living room where a single trunk
remains. She goes further into the apartment and crouches
down in a back corner of the kitchen. She listens as
footsteps come across the courtyard. She hears the red-headed
woman and the cab driver get the trunk. She hears them set it
down once they have it in the courtyard. She hears the steps
of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment. She
hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she
hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen. Remaining
frozen, the dark-haired woman's eyes look up as the red-
headed woman walks right past her, grabs a set of keys off
the kitchen counter, then leaves the apartment. The woman can
hear the door being locked. She lets go, slides to the
kitchen floor, and passes out.

</b><b>INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT , HOLLYWOOD - MORNING
</b><b>    
</b>Two well-dressed men HERB and DAN (mid 30's) are sitting at a
table drinking coffee. Herb has finished eating his
breakfast, but Dan hasn't touched his bacon and eggs - he
appears too nervous to eat. A blonde waitress with a
nameplate saying "DIANE" lays the check on their table
smiles, then walks off.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHERB
</b>ttWhy did you want to go to breakfast if
ttyou're not hungry?

<b>ttttDAN
</b>ttI just wanted to come here.

<b>ttttHERB
</b>ttTo Denny's? I wasn't going to say
ttanything, but why Denny's?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDAN
</b>ttThis Denny's.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHERB
</b>ttOkay. Why this Denny's?
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b><b>ttttDAN
</b>ttIt's kind of embarrassing but,
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHERB
</b>ttGo ahead.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDAN
</b>ttI had a dream about this place.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHERB
</b>ttOh boy.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDAN
</b>ttYou see what I mean...
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHERB
</b>ttOkay, so you had a dream about this
ttplace. Tell me.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDAN
</b>ttWell ... it's the second one I've had, but
ttthey were both the same......they start
ttout that I'm in here but it's not day or
ttnight. It's kinda half night, but it
ttlooks just like this except for the
ttlight, but I'm scared like I can't tell
ttya. Of all people you're standing right
ttover there by that counter. You're in
ttboth dreams and you're scared. I get
tteven more frightened when I see how
ttafraid you are and then I realize what it
ttis - there's a man...in back of this
ttplace. He's the one ... he's the one
ttthat's doing it. I can see him through
ttthe wall. I can see his face and I hope
ttI never see that face ever outside a
ttdream.
<b>    
</b>Herb stares at Dan to see if he will continue. Dan looks
around nervously, then stares at his uneaten food.
<b>    
</b>ttttDAN (cont'd)
ttThat's it.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHERB
</b>ttSo, you came to see if he's out there?

<b>ttttDAN
</b>ttTo get rid of this god-awful feeling.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHERB
</b>ttRight then.

<b>    
</b>Herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to
pay. Dan just sits.
<b>    
</b>As Herb is paying the bill he looks over at Dan just as Dan
is turning to look at him. From Dan's point of view Herb is
standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream.
Herb gets a strange feeling, turns back and finishes up with
the cashier. He motions for Dan to follow him. Dan rises
reluctantly and he and Herb make their way outside.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT. DENNY'S
</b><b>    
</b>Now Herb waits for Dan to lead the way.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttDAN
</b>ttAround here.
<b>    
</b>Dan takes Herb across the front of Denny's to a narrow
sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back.
<b>    
</b>They begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a
payphone. Dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear
corner of the building. Red bricks glide by slowly.
<b>    
</b><b>CLOSER ON DAN
</b><b>    
</b>Beads of sweat cover his face. He finds it difficult to
breathe. Herb is just behind him unable to see the fear
overtaking his friend, but Herb can feel something himself.
<b>    
</b>The red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the
corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close.
<b>    
</b>Suddenly a man - a face ... a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -
staring into Dan's eyes.
<b>    
</b>Dan lurches back. All his breath is suddenly gone. He falls
back into Herb who tries to catch him as he's falling. Dan
hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror.
<b>    
</b>Herb looks up - the man is gone. He looks down to Dan.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHERB
</b>ttDan! ... Dan! You all right? ... Dan!
<b>    
</b>He kneels down and studies his friend. He feels for a pulse
in the neck. He listens for breathing. His friend is dead.

A big jet lands.

</b><b>INT. LAX AIRPORT
</b><b>    
</b>A blonde girl walking with an old woman approaches us. As the
blonde's face fills the screen we move with her and stay with
her as she goes. Her face is bright and her eyes move here
and there taking in everything. She can hardly believe she's
in Los Angeles - the City of Dreams. She and the old woman
pass under a sign which reads "WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES."
The girl smiles and looks around excited by every detail.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>

</b><b>    
</b>The girl and the old lady exit the terminal with their bags.
An older gentleman has joined the old lady. They stop at the
taxicab stand. The old lady takes the blonde girl's hand.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttOLD LADY
</b>ttIt's time to say goodbye, Betty. It's
ttbeen so nice travelling with you.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttThank you, Irene. I was so excited and

<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttOkay I will. Thanks again.
<b>    
</b>Betty and Irene give each other a hug. The old gentleman nods
to Betty and takes Irene off. Betty smiles after them.
Suddenly someone is grabbing her bags. She turns abruptly to
find she is next in line and her cab is waiting. She turns
once more and waves at Irene as her bags are loaded into the
trunk of the cab.

away.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT. STREETS - LOS ANGELES - DAY
</b><b>    
</b>Betty goes from the right side of the cab to the left side of
the cab looking at every building, tree and sign. Each street
sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to
herself as they pass by. She sees La Tijera, La Cienega,
Venice Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, Wilshire
Boulevard, etc., etc. until they reach Fountain and turn
right. Betty's heart is pounding when she sees Havenhurst
and the cab turns left. In the middle of the block on the
right the cab pulls over and stops. Betty sees her new
home ... an ancient, gorgeous courtyard apartment building,
built during the golden age of cinema.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT. 1612 HAVENHURST
</b><b>    
</b>The cab driver puts Betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to
her. She can barely stop looking at the building long enough
to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away.
Betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through
an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working
fountain at its center. A sign on a door to her right reads
Manager and she rings the bell.

<b>    
</b>An older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make-up
and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door.
An unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen
of the still closed screen door.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttMANAGER
</b>ttHi there...ten bucks says you're Betty.

</b>ttYou can call me Coco ... everybody does.
ttStay there, I'll get the key.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttOkay, Coco.
<b>    
</b>Coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling
a huge drag off her cigarette. She starts off into the
courtyard and Betty picks up her bags and follows. As Coco
speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.
<b>

</b>The music fades.

front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog.
She angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.

</b>The dirty and torn black cocktail dress of the dark-haired
woman along with her shoes, purse and undergarments are in a
pile in the bedroom. We drift off them toward the bathroom
where the dark-haired woman can be seen showering through
rippled glass. There's the sound of a door opening. We see a
movement through the glass and the shower goes off instantly.
We can hear the dark-haired woman's frightened breathing as
she waits frozen listening.

</b>Coco leaves and closes the door behind her. Betty begins to
explore the apartment.- After walking a circle in the living
room she passes through the kitchen. She moves down a
hallway looking at paintings and posters. She goes into the
bedroom. She smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge
ornately carved head and foot board. She notices the soiled
dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer. She
stands back up, shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has
all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling
tiles. As she goes toward the sink she smiles to herself in
the mirror above it. Suddenly something catches her eye and
she opens the shower stall. There before her is the naked,
beautiful dark-haired woman.

the windows on the sixth floor.

</b>Two men are in the room, JOE and ED. Joe leans up against a
rack of filing cabinets. He is in his late twenties. He
looks like a run down, heavy metal rocker - wears a blue
denim shirt open, T-shirt underneath, black denim jeans and
motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's
smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is
infectious.
<b>    
</b>The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit,
like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde
hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJOE
</b>ttSo man, that's unheard of ... an accident

</b>ttWell, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff

</b><b>ttttED
</b>ttMaking ends meet, huh.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJOE
</b>ttHardly.
<b>

</b>ttYeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.

</b><b>ttttJOE
</b>ttOh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope

</b><b>ttttED
</b>ttIt was just a thing. The story made you
ttlaugh.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJOE
</b>ttYeah, that's a funny story.
<b>    
</b>Looking like he's rubbing the small of his back Joe moves
over to Ed at his desk. Joe looks down to the surface of the
desk - to a small worn black book.
<b>    
</b>ttttJOE (cont'd)
ttSo, there it is ... Ed's famous black book.

<b>    
</b><b>ttttED
</b>ttYeah, the history of the world in phone
ttnumbers.
<b>    
</b>Joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view
holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out
and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains
out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down
on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the
wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window
behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and
places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's
right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the
finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the
gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap
wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled
scream.
<b>    
</b>ttttJOE (cont'd)
ttt(disgusted with himself)
ttOh...man!
<b>    
</b>With a sense of "just more stuff I got to do" Joe moves
slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the
corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists.
He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy
set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her
buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and
cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the
screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he
begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on
a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls
backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing
blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with
her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling
her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight
back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her
into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man
with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the
corridor. He stops and calls to the man.
<b>    
</b>ttttJOE (cont'd)
ttHey man. She's hurt bad. Get down here
ttand use the phone. Help me out. You
ttgotta call the hospital.
<b>    
</b>The man hesitates...not sure if this jives with what he's
seeing.
<b>    
</b>ttttJOE (cont'd)
ttI mean it! Get down here quick! She's
tthurt and I can't do everything myself,
ttman.

<b>    
</b>Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back
down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him,
pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long
thick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office
with the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line
between Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She
starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe
grabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire,
but the woman has turned around and is almost standing.
<b>    
</b>ttttJOE (cont'd)
ttNo, no, no. You gotta be turned around.
<b>    
</b>He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her
around. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place
himself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two
silenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the
vacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the
scene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest.
The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his
hands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe
rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the
corridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and
clutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him
and the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be
screeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet
into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out
the internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the
building's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.
<b>

ttOh ... man!

ttthis cord doing here? It's the vacuum.
ttIt's the vacuum what did it.

</b>Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in
Eddie's hand - Eddie's finger on the trigger. Joe picks up
the black book - turns and makes his escape by going out the
office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape.

without acknowledging anyone. One of the men in a dark suit

He takes a sip of espresso. A small fleeting expression forms
on Luigi's impassive face as if for one millisecond he is
going to vomit. His mouth opens and he allows the espresso
to fall and dribble onto the napkin. He pushes any remaining
espresso in his mouth out with his tongue. He holds it in

at her with desperation.

force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills.

</b>Both Rita and Betty almost stop breathing. They look at each
other, then back to the money.

it on the bed. She reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse ... A BLUE KEY. Betty
sees Rita's expression change to a kind of <U>horror</U>.

The door opens automatically. Ray passes through and goes

steps forward, then stops. There is a solid glass wall that
we now notice running the width of the office. Cut into the
glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. Beyond
the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a
very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized,
wheelchair. The man is paralyzed except for his right hand
and head. His head appears small in relation to the size of
his body. His suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've
ever seen. His manservant stands in the shadows behind him.

</b>Adam leaves the kitchen and goes out into the garage. He
turns on the light and looks around. He spots some paint
cans on a shelf and grabs one and goes back into the kitchen.
He can hear Lorraine calling his name. She seems to be
coming closer. He sets the jewelry case and the paint can on
the floor, kneels down and opens the paint can with his car
key. Just as Lorraine enters the kitchen, he opens the
jewelry box and empties the 3/4 full gallon can of Hot Pink
paint into her jewelry case.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttLORRAINE
</b><b>ttWHAT.. ARE ... YOU ... DOING!!!???
</b><b>    
</b>He puts his hands into the paint and jewels and smushes them
about. Lorraine rushes toward him.
<b>    
</b>ttttLORRAINE (cont'd)
<b>ttSTOP IT!!!
</b><b>    
</b>Lorraine grabs hold of him. Starts pulling his hair,
slapping his face. She tears his jacket. Adam stands all at
once and with his wet Hot Pink hands he pushes Lorraine and
slams her into the kitchen counter just as Gene the poolman
enters. Gene grabs ahold of Adam, cocks back and slams his
huge suntanned fist into Adam's face.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttGENE
</b>ttThat's not a way to treat your wife,
ttbuddy. I don't care what she's done.
<b>    
</b>Adam gets up off the floor bleeding from the nose and tries
to hit Gene. Gene blocks his punch and slams Adam again,
knocking him down to the kitchen floor where he lands and
spills the jewelry case. Adam, now covered with paint, is
picked up by Gene and thrown out toward the front door.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttLORRAINE
</b>ttThrow him out!
<b>    
</b>Lorraine opens the front door while Gene picks Adam up, moves
him across the carpet and heaves him out onto the front lawn.
Lorraine slams the door behind him.
<b>    
</b>Adam picks himself up, severely dazed and bleeding pretty
badly, he heads for his car.

<b>    
</b>Taka stops gardening and smiles and bows at Adam as he gets
into his car.
<b>    
</b>Adam drives away - pink paint and red blood all over.

picks it up and looks questioningly at Betty.

ttNo ... you shouldn't take that. Let's hide
ttit.
<b>    
</b>They look around the room... There's a hatbox in the closet
above the clothes rack. Betty brings it down, takes out the
hat, and Rita puts the purse inside. Betty puts the hat over
the purse in the hatbox and puts in back in the closet.
Betty puts out her hand. Rita looks at it for a moment,
smiles, and they shake.

which line both sides of the street. Betty is smiling and
once again looking around at everything. Her good mood and
excitement about life lifts Rita's spirits.
<b>    
</b>Coming toward them on the sidewalk are two people - a middle-
aged woman and a young boy around 10 years old. The boy is
very thin and something is wrong with him as he is walking
awkwardly on crutches. As the two groups pass each other on
the sidewalk Betty is struck deeply by the boy's brilliant,
luminous blue eyes which are at once innocent and filled with
wisdom.

Rita's.
<b>    
</b>The manager of Denny's, standing with a woman in a blue
dress, calls Diane's name. Diane turns and looks to the
manager and the woman. A fleeting fear goes through her
eyes. She surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes
out a Mont Blanc fountain pen which she puts under Betty's
check as she places it on their table. She does this very
quickly but Betty notices this and Diane notices Betty
noticing. Diane walks quickly over to the manager and the
woman in the blue dress. Betty turns and watches a heated
conversation that she can't hear, but she sees the woman in
the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then
leaving.

<b>    
</b>The manager says something to Diane and Diane turns her
pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the
manager showing him her innocence. He waves her off and she
goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food. Betty
stops watching and turns her attention to Rita, who is tense
and lost in a thought.

door of Adam's house. Parked at the street is a big limo
with Vincenzo and Luigi Castigliane sitting in the back.

Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed -
his fist like a sledgehammer. Gene goes down. Lorraine
shrieks and leaps on Kenny. Her long fingernails going for
his eyes. Kenny slaps Lorraine hard. The shriek stops
instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet. Gene is back
up and going for Kenny. Kenny gets three punches in on Gene's
head before Gene hits the ground unconscious. Kenny rubs some
pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off
his jacket. He begins walking around the house calling out
for Adam. He sees nothing and hears nothing. He goes back to
the front door and sees Adam's golf clubs sitting there.
Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club. As he snaps
each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the
floor.

</b>Adam feeling like a fool drives up the dark, winding canyon
road. As he nears the top of the canyon the residential area
gives way to desert brush. The road winds steeply up to a
dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit. Adam parks in
a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral.
His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about. No
one is around. There's only a light wind and a few twinkling
stars in the sky above. Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from
the corral gate flare up. Adam hears a noise in the
brightness and turns. There walking toward him into the light
is the Cowboy - dressed in clean blue denim jeans, well-oiled
unscuffed, beautifully engraved cowboy boots, a red
embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt complete with string
tie. Atop the Cowboy's head is a 10 X white Stetson. The
Cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches. He stops in front
of Adam and begins to speak with a true, slow Western drawl.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttHowdy!
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttHowdy to you.

<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY

</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttYeah.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttSure want to thank ya for drivin' all the
ttway up to see me from that Beverly Hills
ttHotel.

<b>ttttADAM
</b>ttNo problem. What's on your mind?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttWell now, here's a man who wants to get
ttright to it. Kinda anxious to get to it
ttare ya?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttWhatever.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttA man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes
ttsome ways toward how a man's life will
ttbe. Is that somethin' you agree with?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttSure.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttNow... did you answer cause you thought
ttthat's what I wanted to hear or did you
ttthink about what I said and answer cause
ttyou truly believe that to be right?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttI agree with what you said...truly.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttWhat did I say?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttThat a man's attitude determines to a
ttlarge extent how his life will be.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttSo since you agree I guess you could be a
ttperson who does not care about the good
ttlife.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttHow's that?

<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttWell, just stop for a little second and
ttthink about it. Will ya do that for me?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttOkay, I'm thinking.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttNo. You're too busy being a smart aleck
ttto be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think
ttand quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya
ttdo that for me?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttLook ... where's this going? What do you
ttwant me to do?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttThere's sometimes a buggy. How many
ttdrivers does a buggy have?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttOne.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttSo let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy
ttand you fix your attitude and you can
ttride along with me.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttOkay.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttNow I know a few things. I know you have
tthad a rough day. You're probably thinkin'
ttI don't know the half of it, but in
ttactual fact I know every part of it. The
ttbusiness of gittin' thrown off your
ttmovie, the heartache of seeing your wife
ttwith another man... losin' access to that
ttprecious film vault...
<b>    
</b>Adam suddenly looks stunned, unsure.
<b>    
</b>ttttCOWBOY (cont'd)
tt... realizin' you don't have hardly a
ttnickel to your name and then add on to
ttthat the sickenin' feeling some men are
ttgonna catch you and hurt you bad for
ttbustin' their vehicle. Some days are like
ttthat. They are rough, but what will
tttomorrow bring? Will it be better than
tttoday? The same ... or worse?
ttA lot of that is up to us individually.
ttUp to us and our attitude. When the
ttCastigliane brothers said "This is no
ttlonger your film," they meant it, but
ttthey didn't mean you were not going to
ttdirect it. I want you to go back to work
tttomorrow. You were re-casting the lead
ttactress anyway ... audition many girls for
ttthe part. When you see the girl that was
ttshown to you earlier today, you will say
tt" This is the girl." The rest of the
ttcast can stay- that is up to you, but
ttthat lead girl is not up to you. Now,
ttyou will see me one more time if you do
ttgood. You will see me two more times if
ttyou do bad. Good night.
<b>    
</b>The Cowboy turns and walks until he is engulfed in darkness.
Through the darkness Adam hears the sound of a car door
opening and closing, then another opening and closing and
then the sound of the car driving away. Adam walks up in the
direction the Cowboy took, but he sees no sign of a car nor
any dust nor any road. He goes back down past the barn and
stables to his car. There standing by his Porsche is the
Cowboy.
<b>    
</b>ttttCOWBOY (cont'd)
ttYou thinkin' this'll work out, cause I
ttwas thinkin' it just might.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttIt will work out.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttGood then, but, just in case, that bank's
ttgonna stay closed a bit longer. You
ttunderstand that?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttI understand.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttYou're an understandin' fella.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttSo, this is the last time I see you then
ttunless I do bad?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCOWBOY
</b>ttNo, this one doesn't count. It's part of
ttthe original one. So then ... until we meet
ttagain.

</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttOkay.

<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttPleased to meet you.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttSARAH JAMES
</b>ttThis is Nicki, my assistant.
<b>    
</b>Nicki, a very stylish, thin girl with black cat-eyed glasses
nods coolly to Betty.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttWALLY
</b>ttAnd this is Martha, Martha Johnson, who
ttyou met out front.
<b>    
</b>Betty nervously smiles to the room.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttHi.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttWALLY
</b>ttWell. Shall we get to it? Would you like
tta water or a coffee before we begin?
<b>    
</b>Betty's hands are beginning to sweat.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttNo, no, I'm fine.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttWALLY
</b>ttWell then, take a seat everyone. Betty
ttwhy don't you join Jimmy and we'll play
ttthe scene. Is there anything you'd like
ttto say Bob... something to Betty before
ttthey begin?
<b>    
</b>Betty stops on her way across to Jimmy and looks to Bob the
director.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>ttNo ... it's not a contest, see, the two of
ttthem with themselves, so don't play it
ttfor real until it gets real.

<b>    
</b>Betty doesn't know what to say. She catches Sarah's
assistant, Nicki, rolling her eyes.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttOkay.
<b>    
</b>Betty continues walking toward Jimmy who opens his arms to
her as she approaches. He's old enough to be her father.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttJust tell me where it hurts, baby.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttWhat?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttI want to play this one close, Bob. Like
ttit was with that girl, what's her name,
ttwith the black hair. That felt good.
ttWhaddya think?
<b>    
</b>Betty looks from Jimmy to Bob.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>ttThat'd be good, Jimmy. Just don't rush
ttthat line again. I told you... the line
ttwhere you say, "Before what?"
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttI was playin' off 'em. They say,
tt"They'll arrest you"... and stuff like
ttthat.. "put you in jail"... they say it
ttlike that. They all say it the same way,
ttso I react like that.
<b>    
</b>Jimmy turns to Betty.
<b>    
</b>ttttJIMMY (cont'd)
ttLook ... what's your name?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttBetty.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttYeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I
ttdon't rush it. We play it close, just
ttlike in the movies.
<b>    
</b>Jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around Betty and brings
her in against his pot belly.
<b>    
</b>ttttJIMMY (cont'd)
ttDad's best friend goes to work.

<b>    
</b>Jimmy smiles as he brings Betty a little closer. She is
trying to concentrate through the nervousness and Jimmy's
breath. There is a silence as Jimmy looks her in the eyes.
Everyone in the room is looking Betty in the eyes.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttWALLY
</b>ttBob?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>ttAnd ... ACTION!
<b>    
</b>Betty and Jimmy start the scene. It is very difficult for
Betty as Jimmy has her in an absurd clench now.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttYou're still here?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttI came back. I thought that's what you
ttwanted.
<b>    
</b>Jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. He gives the
last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttNobody wants you here.
<b>    
</b>Betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from
Jimmy. Jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttReally?
<b>    
</b>Betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttMy parents are right upstairs! They
ttthink you've left.
<b>    
</b>Jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward Betty.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttSo ... surprise!
<b>    
</b>Betty pushes him back.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttI can call them... I can call my dad.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttBut you won't.

<b>    
</b>He grabs Betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him.
He puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and
keeps going down her hips. He jerks his hand back. Betty
looks down and sees Jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh.
Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmy's hand.
She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. Jimmy
lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her
thigh as he sees her smile. With his other hand Jimmy gently
pulls her closer. Something has started coming over Betty
and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way.
She's surprising herself.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(almost a hot whisper)
ttYou're playing a dangerous game here. if
ttyou're trying to blackmail me... it's not
ttgoing to work.
<b>    
</b>Jimmy now surprises himself. He becomes almost tender and
genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttYou know what I want...it's not that
ttdifficult.
<b>    
</b>Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it can't now
and Betty plays it as she feels it. She stays in very close
to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(whispering desperately -
tttslowly)
ttGet out... Get out before I call my dad.
ttHe trusts you... you're his best friend.
ttt(her arms go around him)
ttThis will be the end of everything.
<b>    
</b>Jimmy gets lost. He doesn't know where he is anymore. He
can only see Betty's eyes.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttWhat about you? What will your dad think
ttabout you?
<b>    
</b>Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttStop... just stop! That's what you said
ttfrom the beginning. If I tell what
tthappened... they'll arrest you and put
ttyou in jail, so get out of here before...
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttt(caught by her transfixing,
tttsultry eyes, and almost
tttbreathless ... he finds himself
ttttaking an extra long pause)
ttBefore what?
<b>    
</b>As scripted Betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
back, but wraps the knife around behind Jimmy and pulls him
into a kiss.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(as she kisses him - whispers)
ttBefore I kill you.
<b>    
</b>Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her
shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. He
finally is able to say his line.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttThen they'd put you in jail.
<b>    
</b>As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of
the scene took her over. Tears begin running down her
cheeks. She backs away.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttI hate you... I hate us both!
<b>    
</b>She pretends to drop the knife. The scene ends.
<b>    
</b>Everyone in the room has become mesmerized by Betty, but they
soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the
performance. Sarah turns to Nicki.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttSARAH JAMES
</b>ttI'm going to take her over there.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttNICKI
</b>ttBig time!
<b>    
</b><b>ttttWALLY
</b>ttt(to everyone)
ttWow!
<b>    
</b>Betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling - still shocked at
herself.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttWell, there it was.

<b>    
</b><b>ttttJIMMY
</b>ttThere it was it was! Baby, you got a
ttway!

</b><b>ttttWALLY

<b>    
</b><b>ttttBOB
</b>ttVery good. Really. I mean it was forced
ttmaybe but still humanistic. Yeah, very
ttgood, really.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttWALLY
</b>ttWell, thank you Betty, and I mean that.
ttThat was very impressive. You've done
ttyour Aunt proud and I'm going to tell her
ttthe first chance I get. We'll speak again
ttsoon I'm sure, and thank you so much for
ttcoming in.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttWell, thank you.
<b>    
</b>Betty doesn't quite know what to do. She moves to the center
of the room and just stands. Remnants of the scene still
staying with her.
<b>    
</b>Sarah stands and Nicki stands just after.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttSARAH JAMES
</b>ttThank you, Wally. I'm sure you all have a
ttlot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttWALLY
</b>ttWell, yes indeed. Our pleasure, Sarah,
ttand don't you be a stranger. We'd love to
ttsee you around here again real soon.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttSARAH JAMES
</b>ttWell come along, Betty.
<b>    
</b>Sarah takes Betty's hand and they go to the door. Betty turns
back once more and smiles.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttThank you again, Mr. Brown. It was nice
ttmeeting all of you.
<b>    
</b>Everyone nods and waves and Betty is taken out by Sarah and
Nicki.

</b>The three of them walk down the corridor.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttSARAH JAMES
</b>ttOh God, that was awful!
<b>    
</b>Betty's head spins to Sarah. A look of shock and let down on
her face.
<b>    
</b>ttttSARAH JAMES (cont'd)
ttOh, not you Betty. You were stellar and
ttI mean that, but poor Wally. He'll never

questioning look.

<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>INT. - RECORDING STUDIO - DAY
</b>
We see what looks like a recording studio right out of the
1960's. We're looking through a plate of glass. A blonde
girl is standing at a vintage microphone. Behind her are
three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny
60's suits. We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl
begins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male
vocalists backing her up flawlessly.

We move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound
stage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we
continue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher
surrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people
standing, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and
bustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring
Betty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard
mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The
song continues to play over.

As Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on
the beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty
turns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of
the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than
they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the
song.

<b>ttttADAM
</b>ttt(calling out through an
tttelectronic megaphone)
ttCut it!
<b>    
</b>He gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the
blonde girl. He shakes her hand.
<b>    
</b>ttttADAM (cont'd)
ttThank you very much, Carol. It was really
ttgreat of you to come in. I know how busy
ttyou are.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttOh, man, are you kidding? I love this
ttscript! Where do I sign?

<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttLook... I love you, but there's no way
ttthey're gonna let me cast this thing
ttuntil I've seen everyone. I'll let you
ttknow as soon as I can.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttI know you will ... cause my manager's
ttgonna bug you day and night ... me too.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttIt'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of
tthere.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttOh, you're just so cruel... don't forget
ttme. I'm the girl that's going to play
ttthis part.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttt(lightly pinching her cheek)
ttSee ya later.
<b>    
</b>Adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor.
He looks around. He sees Betty being introduced by Sarah to
some of the studio executives. He goes over to his Assistant
Director and looks down at the man's notepad.
<b>    
</b>ttttADAM (cont'd)
ttWho's next, Hank?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHANK
</b>ttCamilla Rhodes.
<b>    
</b>Adam wonders - worries.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttIs she ready?
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHANK
</b>ttAll ready.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttBring her out.
<b>    
</b>Hank speaks into his walkie-talkie headset. The sound of his
voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHANK
</b>ttt(through walkie-talkie)
ttCamilla Rhodes next!

<b>    
</b>Adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in
front of the microphone. IT IS THE GIRL! The back-up
singers step in behind her.
<b>    
</b>Adam nods to Hank.
<b>    
</b>ttttHANK (cont'd)
ttTurn over!
<b>    
</b>The cameraman calls out, "Speed".
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttt(through megaphone)
ttPlayback!
<b>    
</b>Countdown before the music begins.
<b>    
</b>ttttADAM (cont'd)
<b>ttACTION!
</b><b>    
</b>The strings soar up and Camilla Rhodes begins to sing.
<b>    
</b>On the set Betty hears the song again and turns and watches.
Once again her eyes find Adam as his eyes are finding hers.
This time Adam turns away. He watches Camilla for a moment.
She is passable, but not spectacular. Adam reaches out and
pulls Hank over to him.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHANK
</b>ttYeah?
<b>    
</b>Adam pauses.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttGet Jason over here.
<b>    
</b>Hank gets on his walkie-talkie.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttHANK
</b>ttCindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
<b>    
</b>Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing. JASON GOLDWYN,
a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the
crowd and stops at Adam's side. He looks down at Adam, but
Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes. Jason follows Adam's
gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam.
Adam slowly looks up right into Jason's eyes - wondering how
much Jason knows, but Jason's face doesn't give away a thing.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttJASON
</b>ttDid you want to tell me something, Adam?

<b>    
</b><b>ttttADAM
</b>ttThis is the girl!
<b>    
</b>At that moment Ray, having overheard, comes to Jason's side.
He smiles at Adam.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttRAY
</b>ttExcellent choice, Adam.
<b>    
</b>Adam is sick with himself.
<b>    
</b>Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttOh ... oh...I have to be somewhere. I
ttpromised a friend.
<b>    
</b>She quickly shakes Sarah's and Nicki's hands saying, "I'm
sorry, I'm sorry" and runs off like Cinderella.
<b>    
</b>Adam turns and sees her running off out of his world.
<b>    
</b>Chris Isaak's song "Except The New Girl" segues in over
Connie Stevens and plays as Adam, Sarah and Nicki watch Betty
disappear out the sound stage door.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT.  1612 HAVENHURST - STREET - DAY

</b><b>COURTYARD - 1612 HAVENHURST DAY
</b><b>    
</b>Chris Isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone.

</b>Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruth's apartment. Betty is
laughing, pulling on Rita.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttC'mom. There's nothing to be afraid of.
<b>    
</b>Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT, a strikingly handsome
young black musician, is on his balcony playing the
saxophone. He stops playing when he sees the girls. He
stands and looks as if recognizing someone.

<b>    
</b><b>ttttCORNELL DUMONT
</b>ttHey!

<b>    
</b>Betty and Rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from
the sun.
<b>

</b>ttAnd what's your name?

</b><b>ttttCORNELL DUMONT

ttAsk him who Sol is ...
<b>    
</b>Rita hurriedly starts for the gate.
<b>    
</b>ttttBETTY (cont'd)

get in and the cab pulls away.

</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:

firmly but quietly so the cab driver won't hear.

</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttWhy didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
<b>    
</b><b>ttttRITA
</b>ttt(whispering back)
ttBut I don't know, Sol. I never heard of

<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttYou're not going to get in trouble.
ttYou're going to find out who you are.
ttFinding out who you are gets you out of

doubt all over again.

She turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides
of the street.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttIt should be around here...
<b>    
</b>Rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up
Sierra Bonita. They near a modern apartment compound of
bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and
vegetation. A smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex.
<b>    
</b>ttttBETTY (cont'd)
ttt(points)
ttThat's it ... 2590.
ttt(nudging Rita)
ttDoes it look familiar?
<b>    
</b>Rita shakes her head..no. Rita is looking at a black car
parked down the street facing 2590. She discerns two men
sitting in the front.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttRITA
</b>ttDon't stop!
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttWhat is it? What do you see?!
<b>    
</b><b>ttttRITA

</b><b>EXT. SIERRA BONITA APARTMENT - BACK ALLEY - DAY
</b><b>    
</b>Betty gets Rita out of the cab and pays the driver, who then
drives away. The girls go through a rear gate and enter the
complex walking along a curving concrete walk. This leads
them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a
rough hewn wooden plaque. They scan the list.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttSelwyn ... number 12.
<b>    
</b>They both look around the various doors near them. Betty
spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10
through #20.
<b>    
</b>ttttBETTY (cont'd)
ttIt's this way.
<b>    
</b>They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As
they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a
chainlink service gate to the alley. Standing in the alley is
a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses.
<b>    
</b>Both girls dive for the bushes.
<b>    
</b>The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and
motion. Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay
as still and quiet as possible.
<b>    
</b>ttttBETTY (cont'd)
ttt(panting whisper)
ttNow, you've got me scared.
<b>    
</b>Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in
their direction. Suddenly he turns and smiles at something
to his left.
<b>    
</b>
He hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy
suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress.
Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo
and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary
limousine driver just going about his work. The girls stand
up, relieved and a little embarrassed.
<b>    
</b>ttttBETTY (cont'd)
ttSee, I told you there was nothing to be
ttafraid of!
<b>    
</b>They go up to Bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the
front door.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttRITA
</b>ttOh no ... don't.
<b>    
</b>Betty doesn't listen to Rita. She knocks strongly on the
door. They stand waiting. There's no answer so Betty knocks
again harder. They wait.
<b>    
</b>ttttRITA (cont'd)
ttNo one's ...
<b>    
</b>Suddenly the door opens. An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
stands before them.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
</b>ttYes?

</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttDiane?
<b>

</b><b>ttttMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
</b>ttI switched apartments with her. She's in
tt#17. Just walk down that way. It's just
ttto the right.
<b>    
</b>The woman seems to be looking now at Rita.
<b>    
</b>ttttMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
ttIt's kind of hidden by the foliage.
<b>    
</b>Betty and Rita start to leave.
<b>    
</b>ttttMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd)
ttShe hasn't been around for a few days ...

<b>

ttOh ... go ahead. I've got to get that.

</b>The woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and
Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttI guess you're not Diane.
<b>    
</b>Rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer.
<b>    
</b>They reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes
and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow.
Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no
answer. She knocks again.
<b>    
</b>ttttBETTY (cont'd)
ttStill not home I guess.
<b>    
</b>The girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. Betty tries
to see in the windows. She tries a window and to her surprise
it opens.

ttC'mon help me in. I'll open the front

</b>Betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding, her head
through the open window.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b><b>ttPUSH!!!
</b>
<b>    
</b>Rita reluctantly pushes and Betty is in. As she closes the
window ...
<b>    
</b>ttttBETTY (cont'd)
ttMeet you at the door.
<b>    
</b>Rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as
Betty opens it. Betty has her hand over her mouth and nose.
<b>    
</b>ttttBETTY (cont'd)
ttI don't know if you want to come in here
ttor not. There's some kind of horrible
ttsmell like... something...
<b>    
</b>Rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she
reacts to the smell.

</b>Betty begins to go through the bungalow and Rita follows.
All the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn. They move
slowly, looking around at everything as they go. Betty looks
to Rita to see if any of this is something she remembers.
Rita looks as though she's walking in a trance. Through the
half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor.

</b><b>    
</b>Betty and Rita are moving down the corridor. They pass a
small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make-up
table. They move on down the corridor to a door which is
almost closed. Betty touches the door and it seems to swing
open on its own. They enter the room and stop cold. A scream
starts to build inside Rita. Before them is a dead woman
lying on a bed. Great chunks of mattress are standing upright
having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of
blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The
scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look
closer. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to
leave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and
brings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand.
<b>    
</b>In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. Betty
freezes and keeps Rita quiet with her hand still placed over
her mouth, but she can't stop Rita's violent shaking nor the
horror in her eyes.
<b>    
</b><b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>    
</b><b>EXT. BUNGALOW #17 - DAY
</b><b>    
</b>The Middle-Aged Woman backs away from the front door, looking
around at bungalow #17. She's not sure if she has heard
something or not. She wonders, then turns and goes back to
her bungalow.
<b>    
</b>Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies
open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen.

</b><b>    
</b>Sounds, music churning continues.
<b>    
</b>Great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack Rita's body as she bends
over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a
frenzy. There is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep
through many strands of hair. Betty's is rushing to her -
her hands reach tenderly, but firmly for Rita's hand holding
the scissors. She keeps her from cutting and moves closer,
whispering in Rita's ear. Rita can't stop crying, but lets
Betty hold her. Music changes ...
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttRita... I know what you're doing.

ttWhat ... I..HAVE... to do.
<b>    
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttI know what you have to do, but let me do
ttit.
<b>    
</b>Rita turns and looks up at Betty, her eyes red with crying.
Betty pulls her up facing her. Rita lets Betty take the
scissors. They look into each other's eyes. Betty gently
strokes Rita's cheek, wiping away some tears.

</b>Panning slowly across we see on the bathroom counter various
open bottles, used Q-tips, towels, combs, a brush, a bowl,
and lots of long strands of cut black hair. We continue
moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds. The
reflection of the new Rita moves into the mirror. She has
short, beautiful blonde hair, blonde eyebrows and no make-up.
Betty's reflection comes in beside Rita's. They stare at the
new Rita in the mirror.

</b>Wilkins still in his pajamas, bathrobe and slippers from
morning slouches in an enormous stuffed chair and matching
ottoman, surrounded by piles of papers and coffee cups. His
Jack Russell Terrier wakes and stands at the sound of the
phone ringing on a side table next to Wilkins. Wilkins comes
out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs
his hand through strange, matted tufts of dirty blonde hair.

</b>Betty is sitting on the bed opposite. Rita opens the hatbox
and removes her purse. She opens the purse and takes out the
money. She sits down on the bed and while staring at the
money she thinks of what to say.

before them are the lights of Hollywood with silhouetted
palms, slow-moving theater kleig lights, and floating above
it all the giant sign in the hills reading HOLLYWOOD.

and move to a dark alley. There amongst the dumpsters and
trash cans is the dark silhouette of a figure. We move closer
to the figure. It is the bum and the bum sits. We move
closer and the bum's face fills the screen. It's face is
black with fungus. It's eyes turn and they seem to be red.
