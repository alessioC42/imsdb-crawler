<b>                
</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tFULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
</b>
tIt is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the 
tpeople walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the 
tpolicemen directing traffic.

<b>tPAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS
</b>
twaiting at street corner for light to change.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MAN
</b>
tat the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the 
tsky.

<b>tTWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM
</b>
tas she follows his gaze upward.

<b>tLONG SHOT - THE SKY
</b>
twith hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.

<b>tMED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER
</b>
tas the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd 
twalking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling 
tgulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:

<b>tMED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS
</b>
tin the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.  
tShe is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, 
texquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick 
tsureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, 
ta mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the 
tfront door of a pet shop and enters.

<b>tINT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT
</b>
tMelanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back 
ttoward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.  
tMacGRUDER, comes toward her.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttHello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever 
ttseen so many gulls?

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttHello, Miss Daniels.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhat do you suppose it is?

<b>tMED. SHOT
</b>
tMrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is 
tBARKING, o.s.

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttt(shaking her head)
ttThere must be a storm at sea. That 
ttcan drive them inland, you know.

tThey are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird 
tdepartment now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor 
tof innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie 
tand Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There 
tis a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls 
tare lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so 
tthat the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained 
tbirds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic 
tbirds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, 
tlarger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets 
tin the bigger cages. As they walk:

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttI was hoping you'd be a little late, 
ttMiss Daniels.
ttt(apologetically)
ttYou see, he hasn't arrived yet.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttYou said three o'clock.

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttI know. Oh, I know.
ttt(she is more distressed 
tttnow)
ttI've been calling all morning. Oh, 
ttyou have no idea. Miss Daniels, 
ttthey're so difficult to get, really 
ttthey are. We get them from India, 
ttyou know, when they're just little 
ttchicks, and then we have to...

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWell, this one won't be a chick, 
ttwill he?

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttCertainly not. Oh, no. Certainly 
ttnot. This will be a full grown myna 
ttbird. Full grown.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttAnd he'll talk?

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttWell, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. 
ttYou'll have to teach him to talk.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttYes.
ttt(pause)
ttOh my, I suppose I should call them 
ttagain. They said three o'clock.
ttt(pause)
ttMaybe it's the traffic. I'll call.  
ttWould you mind waiting?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(judiciously)
ttI think maybe you'd better deliver 
tthim. Let me give you my address.
ttt(she begins taking 
tttoff her gloves)

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttt(producing pencil and 
tttpad)
ttOh. Oh, well, all right.

tAs Melanie starts writing:

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttI'm sure they're on the way, though.  
ttCould I just call?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(with a resigned sigh)
ttWell, all right, but...

tShe scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie 
tfinishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the 
tcounter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)
</b>ttHello, this is Betty MacGruder at 
ttDavidson's.
ttt(pause; accusingly)
ttIt's past three, you know.
ttt(pause)
ttWell, how long do you think...? All 
ttright, would you check it please?  
ttYes, I'll wait.

tMelanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, 
tshe begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips 
twith the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding 
ther. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the 
tbars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins 
tBARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.

<b>tMED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER
</b>
tas he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the 
tsteps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about 
ttwenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt 
that.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tseeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of 
tstrawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.  
tThe birds are startled into scarlet flight.

<b>tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
tas they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little 
tnod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes 
ther, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and 
tthen vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.

<b>tMED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tlooking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of 
tthe cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttI wonder if you could help me.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(deliberately, and 
tttwith a touch of 
ttthauteur)
ttI said I wonder if you could help 
ttme.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
ta trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to 
tinform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But 
tthen something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea 
tcomes to her.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(solicitously)
ttYes, what was it you were looking 
ttfor, sir?

<b>tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(deadpan)
ttLovebirds.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttLovebirds, sir?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttYes. I understand there are different 
ttvarieties, it that true?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWell... yes, sir, there are.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttThese are for my sister... her 
ttbirthday you see. As she'll be eleven 
ttand... well, frankly, I wouldn't 
ttwant a pair of birds that were too 
ttdemonstrative.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI understand completely, sir.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttAs the same time, I wouldn't want 
ttbirds that were aloof, either.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(leading him around 
tttshop)
ttNo, of course not.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttDo you have a pair that are just 
ttfriendly?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI think so, sir.
ttt(she looks around)
ttNow then, let me see.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(at the finches)
ttAren't these lovebirds?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttNo, sir, those are... redbirds.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttThe sign says strawberry finches.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(airily)
ttYes, we call them that too.
ttt(she moves away)
ttAhhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
ttt(and stops before a 
tttcage of canaries)

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttThose are canaries, Miss.
ttt(pause)
ttDoesn't this make you feel awful?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(baffled)
ttDoesn't what make me...?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttAll these innocent little creatures 
ttcaged up like this?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWell, we can't just let them fly 
ttaround the shop, you know.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttI suppose not. Is there an 
ttornithological reason for keeping 
ttthem in separate cages?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttOh, certainly. It's to protect the 
ttspecies.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttI imagine that's very important.  
ttEspecially during the moulting season.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttYes, that's a particularly dangerous 
tttime.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttAre they moulting now?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttSome of them are.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttHow can you tell?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWell... they get a sort of hangdog 
ttexpression.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.
</b>
tThe bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttYes, I see.
ttt(pause)
ttAbout those lovebirds, Miss...

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttAre you sure you wouldn't like to 
ttsee a canary instead? We have some 
ttvery nice canaries this week.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttAll right.
ttt(he smiles)
ttShe smiles back.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(he waits)
ttAll right, may I see one, please?

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tas she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries 
tout of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter 
twhere she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, 
tand then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary 
tcage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(feebly)
ttHere, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.

tOne of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and 
tinto the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttOh!  Ohhhhh!

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT
</b>
tas the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and 
tMitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, 
tfinally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all 
tday.

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttWhat is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the 
ttbirds is loose!

tShe joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up 
tto the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches 
tthem suspiciously.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttShhh! Shhhh!

tHe tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers 
tthe bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tthe canary in his hand.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttThere we are!

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttOh, good! Oh, wonderful.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT
</b>
tas Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the 
tdoor.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(putting the canary 
tttin)
ttBack into your gilded cage, Melanie 
ttDaniels.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tstartled.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhat did you say?

<b>tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(savoring this)
ttI was merely drawing a parallel, 
ttMiss Daniels.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttBut how... how do you know my name?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(secretly)
ttA little birdie told me.
ttt(he smiles politely)
ttGood day, Miss Daniels.
ttt(he bows to Mrs.  
tttMacGruder)
ttMadam.
ttt(he starts out)

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttHey, wait a minute!

tShe goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her 
tbafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI don't know you.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttAhhh, but I know you.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttHow?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttWe met in court.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWe never met in court or anyplace 
ttelse.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttThat's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw 
ttyou in court.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhen?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttDo you remember one of your practical 
ttjokes that resulted in the smashing 
ttof a plate glass window?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI didn't break that window!

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttNo, but your little prank did. The 
ttjudge should have put you behind 
ttbars!

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhat are you? A policeman?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttI simply believe in the law, Miss 
ttDaniels, and I'm not too keen on 
ttpractical jokers.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhat do you call your lovebird story 
ttif not a practical...

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttAhhh, but I really do want those 
ttbirds.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttYou knew I didn't work here. You 
ttdeliberately...

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttRight. I recognized you when I came 
ttin. I thought you might like to know 
ttwhat it felt like to be on the other 
ttend of a gag. What do you think of 
ttthat, Miss Daniels?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI think you're a louse.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttI am.
ttt(he tips his hat)
ttGood day.
ttt(to Mrs. MacGruder)
ttMadam.
ttt(and he goes down the 
tttsteps)

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttAnd I'm glad you didn't get your 
ttlovebirds!

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(breezily, as he goes 
tttout)
ttI'll find something else.
ttt(he gives a slight 
tttbow)
ttSee you in court some day.

tThe door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(angrily)
ttThat... that... who was that?

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttI have no idea.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tseething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea.

<b>tMED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tgoing down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She 
tlooks through the glass.

<b>tLONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
</b>
tgetting into his car at the curb.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tlooking after the car at the curb.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tseeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She 
tbegins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns.

<b>tFULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tas she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter.

<b>tMED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V.
</b>
tas she comes up to the counter.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttHave you got a pencil?

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttWhat? Oh, yes, certainly.

tAs Melanie begins writing:

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttThey said the myna bird would be 
tthere later this afternoon. If you'd 
ttcare to come back...

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttNo, you'd better send him. May I use 
ttyour phone?

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttt(bewildered by 
ttteverything)
ttYes, certainly.
ttt(she puts phone on 
tttcounter)

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(as she dials)
ttDo you have any lovebirds?

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttNo, not in the shop. But I can order 
ttthem for you.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttHow soon?

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttWell... well, how soon would you 
ttwant them?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttImmediately.
ttt(into phone)
ttIs this the Daily News? Melanie 
ttDaniels. Would you get me the city 
ttdesk, please?

<b>ttttMRS. MACGRUDER
</b>ttI might be able to have them by 
tttomorrow morning. Would that be all 
ttright?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(with an edged anger)
ttThat would be just fine.
ttt(into phone)
ttHello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I 
ttwant you to do a favor for me.
ttt(pause)
ttNo, this is a small one.
ttt(pause)
ttPressure you? Why, Charlie darling, 
ttwould I try to pressure you?  Will 
ttyou call the Department of Motor 
ttVehicles for me and find out who 
ttowns this license plate? DKQ dash 
ttone seven six.
ttt(pause)
ttYes, a California plate.
ttt(pause)
ttNo, I'll stop up there in a little 
ttwhile. Is daddy in his office?
ttt(pause)
ttOh. No, no, I don't want to break in 
tton a meeting. Just tell him I'll see

ttt(she hangs up)

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE.

</b>ttNow. What time tomorrow morning?

<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tFULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR

tglances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around 
tto the other side, and opens the door.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
</b>
tin a cage as Melanie reaches for them.

<b>tMED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>

tdoes the same for the next column.

<b>tMED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tas she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby, 
tgrabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door.

<b>tREVERSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tcoming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly 
ttoward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing, 
twaiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with 
tanswering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the 
televator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The 
televator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows 
ther to enter first. She does so with a small nod.  The 
televator doors close.

<b>tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR
</b>
tThe birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and 
tMelanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander 
tdown to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him.  Self-
tconsciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds. 
tThe man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The 
tdoors begin to open.

<b>tFULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tstepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is 
tright behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The 
tman is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in 
tfront of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn 
tthe corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment 
tjust opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key. 
tHe looks at Melanie.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR
</b>
tThe man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm

</b>ttHe's not home.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttThat's all right.

tShe presses button for the elevator.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttHe won't be back until Monday. I

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttMonday?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(trapped)
ttWell, I...

tThe elevator doors open.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWell, where did he go?

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttBodega Bay. He goes up there every 
ttweekend.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttBodega Bay? Where's that?

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttUp on the coast. About sixty miles 
ttnorth of here.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttSixty...
ttt(her face falls)
ttOh.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttAbout an hour and a half on the 
ttfreeway. Or two if you take the coast 
tthighway.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttOh.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttI'd hold the birds for him, but I'm 
ttgoing away myself. Someone's got to 
ttfeed them, I suppose.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(in utter despair now)
ttYes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttt(apologetically)
ttI'm awfully sorry.

tHe puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes 
tinside. The door closes. Melanie is alone in the hallway.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE
</b>
<b>tFULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE)

ton the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day, 
twith a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow 
tshould alternate between the winding, twisting road and the 
tocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged 
tbirds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL 
tSHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

ttwo, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face.  Her 
thair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the 
tgarden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth-

tThey walk quickly up the slope to the Tides, establishing 
tgas station across the road, the collection of stores 
topposite, the cars pulling in and out. Mitch opens the door 
tfor her, and they ENTER.

<b>tINT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT
</b>
tThis is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of 
ta local hangout. There are fishermen lounging at the bar, 
tand a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two 
tladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are 
tsitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall 
tof the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the 
tbay and the parking area below. A television set over the 
tbar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western 
tmovie should be HEARD muted throughout following.  DEKE 
tCARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates 
this attention between serving his customers and watching the 
tWestern. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER.

ttWhat happened?

</b>ttYoung woman cut herself.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(accepting the first

ttI don't think it's that serious.  
ttYou want to sit up here?

tMelanie climbs onto the stool.

<b>ttttDEKE
</b>ttYou cut yourself outside, Miss?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttStop worrying, Deke. She was in a

tHe is rummaging around in the kit.

<b>ttttDEKE
</b>ttI had a man trip and fall in the 
ttparking lot once, sued me before I 
ttcould bat an eyelash.

tas he unscrews cap from bottle of peroxide.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttJust some peroxide. I want to clean 
ttout the cut.

tHe pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the 
tcut. They are silent for several seconds. Then:

</b>ttSo you're a lawyer.

</b>ttThat's right. What are you doing in

ttyou be staying?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttJust a few... just a day or two...

ttOh, no you don't!

tHe takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttBend your head down. This little 
ttBand-Aid won't show.

tHe presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a 
tmirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at 
tit. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says:

</b>ttSo you came up to see Annie, huh?

ttto find out who I was, and where I 
ttlived and...

</b>ttIt was no trouble at all. I simply

</b>ttI loathe you. You have no manners.

</b>ttNone of your business.

tShe lowers her head.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttAnnie... Annie may have made other 
ttplans. I'll have to see. Besides, I 
ttcan find my own way.

ttMay I use your phone? I'd like to

ttIt gets a little chilly here at night

tMelanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause.

</b>ttWell, how'd your evening go?

tMelanie shrugs.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttDid you meet Lydia?

tMelanie nods.

</b>ttOr would you rather I changed the

tThere is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttLook, I see no reason for being coy 
ttabout this. It was Mitch Brenner.

tMelanie nods.

</b>ttI guess you knew that, anyway.

</b>ttAnnie -- there's nothing between

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttIsn't there?

ttMaybe there isn't. Maybe there's 
ttnever anything between Mitch and any

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttI think I'll have some of that, too.
ttt(she pours brandy, 
tttdrinks, sighs)
ttI was seeing quite a lot of him in 
ttSan Francisco, you know.
ttt(she smiles weakly)
ttAnd then, one weekend, he asked me 
ttup to meet Lydia.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhen was this?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttFour years ago. Of course, that was 
ttshortly after his father died.  Things 
ttmay be different now.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttDifferent?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttWith Lydia.
ttt(pause)
ttDid she seem a trifle distant?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttA trifle.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttThen maybe it isn't different at 
ttall. You know, her attitude nearly 
ttdrove me crazy. I simply couldn't 
ttunderstand it.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttWhen I got back to San Francisco I 
ttspent days trying to figure out just 
ttwhat I'd done to displease her.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttAnd what had you done?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttNothing! I simply existed. So what 
ttwas the answer? A jealous woman, 
ttright? A clinging possessive mother.
ttt(she shakes her head)
ttWrong. With all due respect to 
ttOedipus, I don't think that was the 
ttcase at all.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttThen what was it?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttLydia liked me, you see. That was 
ttthe strange part of it. In fact, now 
ttthat I'm no longer a threat, we're 
ttvery good friends.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttThen why did she object to you?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttBecause she was afraid.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttAfraid you'd take Mitch?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttAfraid I'd give Mitch.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI don't understand.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttAfraid of any woman who'd give Mitch 
ttthe only thing Lydia can give him --
ttlove.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttAnnie, that adds up to a jealous, 
ttpossessive woman.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttNo, I don't think so. She's not afraid 
ttof losing her son, you see.  She's 
ttonly afraid of being abandoned.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttSomeone ought to tell her she'd be 
ttgaining a daughter.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttShe already has a daughter.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhat about Mitch? Didn't he have 
ttanything to say about this?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttt(apologetically)
ttI can understand his position. He 
ttwent through a lot with Lydia after 
tthis father died. He didn't want to 
ttrisk going through it all over again.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI see.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttSo it ended. Not immediately, of 
ttcourse. I went back to San Francisco, 
ttand I still saw Mitch every now and 
ttthen... but we both knew it was 
ttfinished.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttThen what are you doing here in Bodega 
ttBay?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttYou get straight to the point, don't 
ttyou?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI'm sorry. Forgive me.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttNo, that's all right, I don't mind.  
ttI came up here for two reasons. To 
ttbegin with, I was bored with my job 
ttin San Francisco. I was teaching at 
tta private school there... well, you 
ttknow, you probably went to one 
ttyourself.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI did.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttThen you know. Little girls in brown 
ttbeanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. 
ttI'll go into that classroom on Monday 
ttmorning, and I'll look out at twenty-
ttfive upturned little faces, and each 
ttof them will be saying, 'Yes, please 
ttgive me what you have.'
ttt(pause)
ttAnd I'll give them what I have. I 
tthaven't got very much, but I'll give 
ttthem every ounce of it. To me, that's 
ttvery important. It makes me want to 
ttstay alive for a long long time.
ttt(she sighs)
ttThat's the first reason.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttAnd the second?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttt(simply)
ttI wanted to be near Mitch.
ttt(pause)
ttIt was over, and I knew it, but I 
ttwanted to be near him, anyway.
ttt(she smiles)
ttYou see, I still like him a hell of 
tta lot. That's rare, I think. I don't 
ttwant to lose his friendship... ever.

tThere is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE 
tshrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer 
tit.

tMelanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie 
tto the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her 
tthroughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie 
ttalks to Mitch in the background.

tAnnie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a 
twistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally 
tand irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.

</b>ttt(at phone; coolly)

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttI'll be going, too, to help out. It

</b>ttIt seems so pointless.

ttI think I'll go to sleep. This has 
ttbeen a busy day.
ttt(picking up her paper 
tttbag)
ttMy luggage.

tShe smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttPretty. Did you get that at 
ttBrinkmeyer's?

tMelanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent 
tfor a moment, pensive. Then:

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttDo you think I should go?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttThat's up to you.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttIt's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttNever mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(firmly)
ttYes.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttThen go.

tThe room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttThank you, Annie.

tSuddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, 
tstartling them both.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttt(rising)
ttWho can that be at this hour?
ttt(she walks to door)
ttWho is it?
ttt(no answer)
ttIs someone there?

tMelanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks 
tthe door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.  
tThere is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.

tHIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with 
tballoons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. 
tThe children, in party clothes, with their parents, are 
tclustered around a long folding table upon which are 
tsandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either 
thelping the children to more or telling them they are having 
ttoo much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and 
tLAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, 
tare Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and 
taway from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin 
tbend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the 
tentrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. 
tThe CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more,

tof the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.

ttOn Mondays and Wednesdays, I work 
ttfor the Travelers' Aid. At the

</b>ttHelping travelers.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttYes.

tShe hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really 
tconsidered before what she does with her time, and now that 
tshe is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and 
tunimportant.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttAnd on Tuesdays, I take a course in 
ttGeneral Semantics at Berkeley.  That's 
ttnot a job, of course. I just take it 
ttbecause...

</b>ttOn Thursdays I have my meeting and

</b>ttNothing.

</b>ttt(facetiously)
ttYou'll think me very bold, sir.

tShe leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out 
tLAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into 
tMelanie's face.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tserious, introspective.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttThat's silly, isn't it?  Teaching a

ttMaybe I ought to go join the other 
ttchildren.

<b>tFULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
tas she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where 
tthe children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch 
tstares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse 
tof character, and then follows her down the dune. The children 
tare all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold 
tfrom Michele to Cathy.

<b>tCAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
tThe CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We 
tsee Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by 
tway of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they 
treach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of 
tthe dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS 
tOFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the 
tchildren. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from 
tMichele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back.  During 
tthis, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes 
tof Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is 
twatching Mitch and Melanie.

tcatches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat 
tas she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple.

tthills, a malcontent. He went around 
tttelling all the other sparrows that 
tthuman beings weren't fit to rule 
ttthis planet, preaching wherever anyone 
ttwould listen...

</b>ttGrowing a beard...

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(delighted)
ttYes, of course, he had to have a 
ttbeard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' 
tthe kept saying, over and over...

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttSo they united.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttNot at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows 
ttout for kicks...

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttWell, they'll go along with anything.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttSure. But eventually, even the more 
ttserious-minded birds began to listen.  
tt"Why should humans rule?" they asked
tt themselves.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttHear!

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhy should we submit ourselves to 
tttheir domination?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttHear, hear!

</b>ttAnd all the while, that sparrow was 
ttgetting in his little messages.  
ttBirds of the world, unite!

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttTake wing!

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttYou have nothing to lose but your 
ttfeathers.

tThey both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then

</b>ttt(attempting to be

ttWhat it was, probably...

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttMmm?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttThey're probably hungry, that's all.  
ttThis was a bad summer. They eat

ttand the hills are all burned out, so 
ttthey're probably searching for food 
ttwherever they can get it.

</b>ttWith my little sparrow leading team.

tShe laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time.  
tLike children who have told themselves a too realistic horror

tshattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane 
tof glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its

tout of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near 
tdecapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser, 
tall the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS, 
tand begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass, 
tcontinues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its 
tPAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single

tan unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she 
tis incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips 
ther way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still 
tscreaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she 
tbacks the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway,

tas Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and 
tthen picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his 
tcar starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen, 
tthrough the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on 
tthe other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.

<b>ttttLYDIA (O.S.)
</b>ttMitch?

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM
</b>
tThis is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a 
tlife no longer valid.  There are photographs of her dead 
thusband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of 
tMitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct 
tfemininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing 
tthe tray.

</b>ttNo, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought 
ttyou might like some tea.

<b>tTWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

tThere is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed, 
tarranges the pillows behind Lydia.

</b>ttAl Malone wanted him out at the 
ttFawcett farm.

</b>ttHe must have. He sent for the Santa

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttWhat good will they do?

tShe sips at the tea. There is a long awkward pause. Melanie 
twalks to the window and looks out over the bay.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttCathy. At the school.

tat the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression 
tclearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all 
tright. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting 
tsmile on her face, and her voice is soothing.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttTry not to think of that, Mrs.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttI wish I were a stronger person.  
ttThere is a long awkward silence. She

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttI lost my husband four years ago, 
ttyou know.
ttt(pause)
ttIt's odd how you depend on someone 
ttfor strength, and then suddenly all 
ttthe strength is gone, and you're

</b>ttI'm not this way, you know. Not 
ttusually. I don't fuss and fret over 
ttmy children.
ttt(pause)
ttWhen Frank died...
ttt(pause)
ttYou see, he knew the children, he 
ttreally knew them. He had the knack 
ttof being able to enter into their 
ttworld, of becoming a part of them.  
ttThat's a rare talent.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttI wish I could be that way.

tThere is another silence. A curious thing is happening in 
tthis room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her 
thusband's death, is discussing it with another person.  
tCuriously, the person is Melanie.

ttI'm not quite sure how I feel about

ttThen I don't suppose it'll matter

<b>tINT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT
</b>
tIt is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as 
tDEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his 
twife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A 
tDRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of 
tbooze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in 
this shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and 
tefficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another 
ttable, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing 
tand clowning around throughout following at a table in the 
trear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the 
tcounter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens.  
tOver her head, the television set is blasting with its 
tperennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.

twoman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through

thave trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the

tshe sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the

tAt this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of 
ta man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows.

tand covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to 
tkeep her warm. He turns away then.

tMalevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers.

tAs in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at 
tthe birds. Melanie dashes forward.

ttMitch! Don't!

tShe runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he 
tmaniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are 
tnow hovering flight.

</b>ttPlease! Get Cathy!  Let's get out of

tHer words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the 
thouse and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a

tCathy to her.

tthen a door is CLOSED.

tWe see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer 
tin the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA.

tHe joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the

tCLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA 
tTRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings 
tto brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues 
tlow over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting 
tthere patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, 
tnot a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the 
tBrenner house in the distance.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

tBehind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed 
tacross the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two 
tattic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.

tcovered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is 
tstill smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds.

tas Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner, 
tcarrying a load of driftwood and old lumber.

</b>
tas she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She 
tis looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is 
tnot the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her 
thair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked 
twith soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there 
tis a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she 
tstands looking toward the distant smoldering town.

tcan HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the 
tsound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch.  
tThere is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, 
tkerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace 
tputting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room 
tand dumps another load.

texcept for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more 
twood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still 
tare CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in 
tthe house.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttShhh. Shhh.

tSilence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, 
tthe THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence.  More panes 
tof glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards 
tand the outside of the house begins building, almost like 
tmuffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. 
tInterspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, 
tis the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section 
tentering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the 
troof.

tlooking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She 
tsqueezes her eyes shut.

<b>tTWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

tThey leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR 
tCathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling 
tof wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of 
tbirds striking the house.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE ROOM
</b>
tMitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the 
tbirds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his 
twatch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back 
tdoor. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the 
tdining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
</b>
twatching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?  
tHe cannot tell.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tlooking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a 
tNEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing 
tsound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.

<b>tMED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tcoming into the entry hall.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR
</b>
tThe wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside 
tassail the door.

<b>tFULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tturning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining 
troom. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it 
ttoward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and 
tpiles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, 
tCAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags 
tit to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table 
twhen Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with 
talarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is 
tand then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of 
tdesperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The 
tCLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din 
tnow, insidious and increasingly more frightening.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttWhen will they stop?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttI thought they'd have stopped by 
ttnow.

</b>ttAlmost two a.m.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttYou must be exhausted.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttHow about you?

tShe shakes her head. They both move into the dining room, 
tthe CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their 
tcage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready 
tto carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the 
tchair, goes to the cage.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tlooking at the birds, wondering.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS
</b>
tlooking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their 
texpressions. Malice or benevolence?

<b>tMED. SHOT - MITCH

tas he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.  
tOne of them tweets.

</b>
<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttI wonder if Cathy fed them.

tHe turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, 
ttakes out a small box of bird feed.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE
</b>
tas his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.  
tHis hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the 
tsmall catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.  
tCautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.  
tThe birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the 
tsmall feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it 
tin the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, 
ttweeting, they begin to eat.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM
</b>
tas Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped 
tagainst the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.  
tWearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling, 
tpecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(holding her)
ttYou should have left when you wanted 
ttto.

tShe shakes her head.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttYou'd have been safe in San Francisco.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI don't want to be safe. I want to 
ttbe with you.

tThere is something pathetically comic about her voice, like 
ta small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, 
tMitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand 
tin each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of 
tnight sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(in the darkness)
ttThe power.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttMitch...

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttWait here. Don't move.

tThe screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the 
tblackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the 
tSOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes 
ton.

tas he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as 
the directs the beam upwards.

</b>ttNo... wait.
ttt(pause)
ttHold me.

tIn the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is

tA kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the 
tfire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep 
ton the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs.  
tMitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly 
tand steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer 
tthe sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another 
tSOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a 
tsteady dribbling, difficult to place.

tfrom somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, 
tpicks up a very long flashlight.

<b>tFULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tas she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the 
tentry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled 
tagainst the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into 
tthe kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam 
ton the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor 
toutside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, 
tgoes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's 
tall right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second 
tbedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.

tclimbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first 
tdoor upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light 
ton the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, 
tgoes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to 
tthe windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back 
ttoward the door when she stops.

tswinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.

<b>ttttMITCH (O.S.)
</b>ttMelanie!

<b>tFULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS
</b>
tgrotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is 
ta crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering 
twings.

<b>ttttMITCH (O.S.)
</b>ttMelanie, open the door!

tHe hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie 
tstruggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed 
tby the birds.

tShe falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the 
tspreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering 
tof wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault 
ton the door by Mitch outside.

<b>ttttLYDIA (O.S.)
</b>ttt(screaming)
ttMitch, get her out of there!

<b>tMED. SHOT - THE ROOM
</b>
tMelanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in 
tview. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see 
ton the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.

<b>ttttMITCH (O.S.)
</b>ttMelanie!

tThe door begins to open.

<b>tFULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tas the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room.  He 
tbegins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for 
tMelanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins 
tdragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been 
tshredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.  
tWe catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch 
tpulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut 
tbehind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at 
tthe few birds that have escaped into the corridor.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttMother, get a rope!

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttOh, my God, look at her!

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(shouting)
ttGet a rope!

tShe rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds.  
tThere is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He 
twill not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his 
thand, knocking the club from it.

<b>tMED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tas the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his 
thands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob.  
tAnother bird flutters into the corridor.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tin anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his 
thands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and 
tis immediately attacked by the other bird.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttMother! Hurry!

<b>tTWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
</b>
tas she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a 
theavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily 
tto the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and 
tcompassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the 
tdoorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to 
tthe bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to 
tMelanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia 
tfollowing. As they go downstairs:

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttCathy! Get a blanket and some 
ttbandages!

<b>ttttCATHY
</b>ttt(at the foot of the 
tttstars, on the verge 
tttof tears)
ttIs she all right?

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
tcradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttI'm... I'm....

<b>tFULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tas he carries her into the living room, but her down on the 
tcouch.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttJust lie there and keep still.

tCathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket.  
tBy the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over 
tMelanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands 
tare trembling, and he drops it.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttLet me do that, Mitch.

tShe picks up the bandage.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttI can handle it.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttI know you can.
ttt(her eyes meet his)
ttBut I'd like to.

tHe nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(weakly)
ttPlease don't mess me up with bandages, 
ttMrs. Brenner.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttShhhh. Shhhh.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttPlease.

tBut she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the 
tcuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttt(as she works)
ttI'm not very good at this, Mitch.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttYou're doing fine.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttt(Apologizing)
ttI mean. I want to...

tPause.

<b>ttttCATHY
</b>ttListen!

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
traising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to 
thear.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttThey're gone. God have mercy, they're 
ttgone.

<b>tFULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tas he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the 
ttable and chair. He opens the door a crack.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE YARD
</b>
tthrough the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no 
tbirds visible.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE DOOR
</b>
tfrom outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred 
tand splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds 
tspill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is 
tdirectly behind him.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE HOUSE
</b>
ta shambles, all the windows broken.

<b>tTWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
</b>
<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttThey're gone. The same pattern.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttBut they'll be back.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttWe won't be here.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttWhere can we go, Mitch? There's no 
ttplace to go.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttI want to try for San Francisco.  
ttThere are buildings there. Steel and 
ttconcrete!

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttt(shaking her head)
ttWe'd never make it. They're probably 
ttall over the road.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttWe have to try it.
ttt(a long silence)
ttWe can't stay here.
ttt(silence)
ttMelanie needs help.
ttt(silence)
ttMother, the house won't take another 
ttattack.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttIf...
ttt(pause)
ttIf... when we get to San Francisco...
ttt(pause)
ttIf they're already there?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttThey won't be.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttIf they are?

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttWe'll worry about that when we get 
ttthere.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttI'm frightened, terribly frightened.  
ttI... I don't know what's out there, 
ttMitch.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttWhat do we have to know, Mother?  
ttWe're all together, we all love each 
ttother, we all need each other. What 
ttelse is there? Mother, I want us to 
ttstay alive!

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttt(nodding; then after 
ttta pause)
ttI started to say... inside...

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttYou don't have to.

tHe holds out his hand to her.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttI think we'd better get started.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE
</b>
<b>tFULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD
</b>
tIt is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before 
tdawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following 
tuntil the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is 
tdeafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's 
tconvertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house 
ttogether and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the 
tback seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background 
tis the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia 
tcomes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking 
tdown at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the 
thouse.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - CATHY
</b>
tShe is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just 
toutside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tlooking back at her.

<b>tFULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA
</b>
tAcross the expanse of the desolated yard.

<b>ttttCATHY
</b>ttMay I take them, Mitch?

tHe does not answer. She continues looking at him.

<b>ttttCATHY
</b>ttThey haven't harmed anyone.

<b>ttttLYDIA
</b>ttTake them.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttt(with a slow nod)
ttWe'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.

tHe takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car.  
tThe CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front 
tseat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, 
tand looks toward the trees.

<b>tMED. SHOT - THE TREES
</b>
tcovered with waiting birds.

<b>tMED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
tgetting into car.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttBe careful with that door.

tCathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch 
tdoes the same with his door.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttt(weakly)
ttMitch, if they hear the car 
ttstarting... if they see movement...

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttWe'll take it slow until we get to 
ttthe main road.
ttt(pause)
ttAre you ready?

tanticipation on all the faces.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttAll right.
ttt(he takes a deep breath)
ttHere we go.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE CAR
</b>
tfrom the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is 
tstill, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it 
tpasses the gate and starts down the road.

<b>tMED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
</b>
tas they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small 
tfire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact.  
tThe car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the 
troad.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW
</b>
tShe gasps quickly.

<b>tMED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE

tas the tension begins to starts.

tas they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with 
twaiting seagulls.

</b>ttt(whispering)
ttMitch, let's turn back.

<b>ttttMITCH
</b>ttShhh. Shhhhh.

<b>tMED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE
</b>
tas the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front 
tporch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his 
thands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded 
twindow, we see a woman and child peering from a gap.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - CATHY
</b>
treacting.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V.
</b>
tas it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding 
troad to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still-
tstanding wires, watching, waiting.

tFULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as 
tthe car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of 
tbirds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every 
tpole, on every fence.

</b>ttCan we turn back?

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>

</b>ttI... I don't think so. If we get 
ttthrough town, I think we'll be all 
ttright.

<b>tFULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR
</b>
tThere is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest 
treason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, 
twho makes the decision.

<b>ttttMELANIE
</b>ttThen go ahead, Mitch.

<b>tFULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR
</b>
tas it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow 
trate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds.

</b>
tas the car moves past them slowly.

tclosing her eyes.

<b>tFULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE

tthrough the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with 
tbirds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all 
tover the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the 
topen door and across the road, dead people are lying in the 
tgutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken 
twindows.

</b>
tIt is arrow-straight, no curves.

<b>tFULL SHOT - THE CAR
</b>
tin a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway. It begins 
tto outdistance the birds. The gap widens. A flock of birds 
tattacks it from the side of the road, but it speeds into 
tthem and through them. The gap grows wider and wider. They 
tare well ahead of the birds now.
