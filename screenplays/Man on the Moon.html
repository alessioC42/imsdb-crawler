      Man on the Moon (1999)
      by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.


<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT. VOID - DAY
</b>
Standing in a nonexistent set is ANDY KAUFMAN, looking a bit
nervous.  Wide-eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a
needy, unsettling cuteness.  His hair is slicked-down, and
he wears the "FRIENDLY WORLD" costume from the Andy Kaufman
special.

Finally, Andy speaks -- in a peculiar FOREIGN ACCENT.

<b>ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
</b>tHallo.  I am Andy.  Welcoom to my
tmovie.
tt(beat; he gets upset)
tI hoped the story of my life would
tbe nice...but it turned out
tterrible!  It is all LIES!  Tings
tare mixed up... real people I knew
tplay different people.  WHAT A MESS!
tSo I broke into Universal and cut
tout the junk.  Now it's much
tshorter.  In fact, this is the end
tof the movie.  So tanks for comink!
tBye-bye!

Andy puts a needle on a phonograph, and swelling CLOSING
CREDITS MUSIC starts to play.  FINAL CREDITS roll.

Andy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience.
Every time the music ends he picks up the needle and
restarts the music.  He does that as many times as the
credits require.

Finally, CREDITS END.  And then--a sly smile.  He leans in.
DROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS.

<b>ttANDY (AS REGULAR VOICE)
</b>tOkay!  Just my friends are left.  I
twanted to get rid of those other
tpeople... they would have laughed in
tthe wrong places.
tt(beat)
tI was only kidding about the
tmovie... it's actually PRETTY GOOD!
tIt shows everything... from me as a
tlittle boy until my death --
tt(his eyes pop; he
ttcovers his mouth)
tOops!!  I wasn't supposed to talk
tabout that!  Oh.  Eh, uh, we better
tjust begin.  It starts back in Great
tNeck, Long Island...

Andy turns to a primitive 16mm PROJECTOR and turns it on.
WHIR!  He smiles at the flickering light.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tOh, yes.  I remember it well...

We PUSH INTO the white light.  It fills our frame, blazing
whiter, whiter...

<b>tttt      DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - 1957 - DAY
</b>
A BLACK AND WHITE image slowly becomes COLOR.  Great Neck,
1957.  An upper-class Jewish neighborhood.  In the street,
crewcut BOYS play t-ball, laughing and shouting.  A fat
convertible pulls up to the smallest house, and STANLEY
KAUFMAN, 40, gets out.  Still in his suit, he's a well-
meaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible.

Stanley goes over to admire the t-ball game.  At bat is his
son MICHAEL, 6, a natural charmer.  Michael swings -- crack!
-- and hits a solid single.  Stanley smiles.

<b>ttSTANLEY
</b>tThat's my boy!  Good swingin',
tkiddo.
tt(warm beat; then a
ttlook)
tHey -- Michael... where's your
tbrother?

<b>ttMICHAEL
</b>tHe's inside.

Instantly -- Stanley's mood turns black.  He frowns angrily,
then snatches his briefcase and marches in.

<b>INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, KITCHEN - 1957 - DAY
</b>
Baby CAROL is crying.  Mom JANICE, 35, quickly peels
carrots, trying to get dinner made.  Stanley marches past.

<b>ttSTANLEY
</b>tIs he in his room?

<b>ttJANICE
</b>tOf course he's in his room.
tt(aggravated)
tAll his "friends" are in there.

Stanley glowers.  He huffs upstairs.

<b>INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, HALLWAY - 1957 - DAY
</b>
Stanley hurries up to Andy's shut door.  We hear little Andy
doing VOICES.

<b>ttANDY (O.S.)
</b>tt(as WORRIED GIRL)
tBut professor, why are the monsters
tgrowing so big?
tt(now as BRITISH
<b>ttPROFESSOR)
</b>tIt's something in the jungle water.
tI need to crack the secret code.

Stanley rolls his eyes.  He opens the door...

<b>INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY
</b>
...revealing ANDY, 8, performing for the wall.  Andy is
happy and enthusiastic... as long as he's acting.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(as BRITISH
<b>ttPROFESSOR)
</b>tMaybe I should talk to the natives.
tt(as dancing NATIVES)
tShoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo
tba --

<b>ttSTANLEY
</b>tAndy!

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(startled)
tOh!

The boy suddenly turns off, becoming introverted... awkward.
Frustrated, Stanley stares at his son.

<b>ttSTANLEY
</b>tAndy, this has to stop.  Our house
tisn't a television station.  There
tis not a camera in that wall.

Andy glances over at the wall.  Hmm.

ttSTANLEY (cont'd)
tt(trying to cope)
tSon... listen to me.  It isn't
thealthy.  You should be outside,
tplaying sports.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tBut I've got a sports show.
tChampionship wrestling, at five.

<b>ttSTANLEY
</b>tt(he blows his top)
tYou know that's not what I meant!
tLook, I'm gonna put my foot down!
tNo more playing alone.  You wanna
tperform, you GOTTA have an audience!

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(he points at the
ttwall)
tB-but I have them.

<b>ttSTANLEY
</b>tNo!  That is NOT an audience!  That
tis PLASTER!  An audience is people
tmade of flesh!  They -- live and
tbreathe!  Got it?!

Andy thinks, considering his options.  Then, he nods.
<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - 1957 - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
Baby Carol sits in her crib.  Andy's hands suddenly YANK her
out.

<b>INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY
</b>
Andy hurries in and plops Carol down on the floor.  She
dutifully sits there, deadpan.

Andy returns to the center of the room.  He resumes his
show.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(as KIDDIE SHOW
<b>ttHOST)
</b>tAnd now, boys and girls!  It's time
tfor... TV Fun House!
tt(he makes an
<b>ttAPPLAUSE SOUND)
</b>tHi, everybody!  Are you ready for a
tsingalong?  I'll say the animal, and
tyou make his sound!  Okay...?  Okay!
tt(he starts to SING)
t"Oh, the cow goes........."

Carol stares, unblinking.  Then --

<b>ttCAROL
</b>tMoo.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(he smiles, pleased)
t"And the dog goes......"

<b>ttCAROL

<b>INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT
</b>
TIGHT on ANDY, now GROWN UP.  26-years-old, still performing
the song.

<b>ttDRUNK AUDIENCE
</b><b>tMEOW!!
</b>
WIDE - It's a small, hip New York nightclub.

<b>ttANDY

</b>
<b>ttANDY
</b>t"And that's the way it goes!"
tt(he grins)
tThank you.  Goodbye!

Andy waves and bows.  There's faint scattered applause.

Andy sighs.  An irritated MANAGER steps onstage.  He shoots
Andy a disgruntled look, then takes the mike.

<b>ttMANAGER
</b>tThe comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman,
tLadies and Gentlemen!

In the b.g., Andy starts packing up his props: Hand puppets,
conga drums, a phonograph... it all goes into a big bulky
case.

<b>ttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
The club is empty.  At the bar, the manager cleans up.  Andy
eagerly comes over.  Offstage, his presence is soft, placid
-- his voice barely above a whisper.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tSo, Mr. Besserman, same slot
ttomorrow...?

<b>ttMANAGER
</b>tt(awkward)
tEh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm...
tthinkin' of letting you go...

<b>ttANDY
</b>tYou're firing me??
tt(beat)
tYou don't even pay me!

<b>ttMANAGER
</b>tLook -- I don't wanna seem
tinsulting.  But... your act is like
tamateur hour: Singalongs...
tpuppets... playing records...

A stunned beat.  Andy is hurt.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tWhat do you want?  "Take my wife,
tplease"??

<b>ttMANAGER
</b>tSure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the
ttraffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a
tlittle blue material...

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI don't swear.  I -- I don't do what
teveryone else does!

<b>ttMANAGER
</b>tWell, everyone else gets this place
tcookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to
tmove the booze when you're singin'
t"Pop Goes The Weasel."

Andy stares, disheartened.
tt   MANAGER (cont'd)
tI'm sorry.  You're finished here.

An uncomfortable beat -- and then Andy starts crying.

The manager is dumbfounded.  He doesn't know what to do.

Tears are rolling pitifully down Andy's cheeks.  The manager
is confused -- totally disoriented.  Shamed, Andy covers his
face, then runs out.  Silence.  The manager stares after
him... having no idea what just happened.

<b>EXT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT
</b>
Sobbing Andy bursts out the door.  He steps onto the
sidewalk -- and IMMEDIATELY STOPS CRYING.  Just like that.

Andy lifts his big case and starts walking.  Andy shakes his
head angrily.

He turns down a dark street, hurrying alone through an
unsavory New York neighborhood.  But then... TWO MEN
appear... silently approaching.  Andy stops uncertainly --
debating whether to turn around.  But in that second -- the
thugs are upon him, glaring menacingly.

<b>ttTHUG #1
</b>tGive us your wallet.

Andy stares fearfully.  An anxious moment.  He thinks...
considering his options.

Then, he suddenly stammers in a thick FOREIGN ACCENT.

<b>ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
</b>tI -- doo not unterstand!!

<b>ttTHUG #1
</b>tGive us your money!

<b>ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
</b>tWhat??  What mooney?  Abu daboo!  I
tdo not have mooney!

The thugs glance at each other.

ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
tPleaze!  I just move to America
tyezterday!  I do not know!

<b>ttTHUG #1
</b>tWhat's in the case?

<b>ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
</b>tNO!  Eeet, eet is just perzonal
ttrifles from my homeland --

<b>ttTHUG #2
</b>tShut up!  Gimme that thing!

The guy snatches the case.  He impulsively BREAKS the
lock... and clothes, congas and records fall out.

The thugs are dismayed.

<b>ttTHUG #1
</b>tGoddamn immigrants!

<b>ttTHUG #2
</b>tThis guy's pathetic.  Let's go.

Harsh glances.  They angrily turn and leave.

Andy takes a nervous breath, then starts picking his things
off the street.  He shouts after the guys:

<b>ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
</b>tTank you veddy much...!

<b>ttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. NY IMPROV - 1975 - NIGHT
</b>
The Improv, the biggest comedy club around.  People are
lined up, waiting.  The man strides up -- GEORGE SHAPIRO, a
Hollywood talent manager.  George is old school: Bronx
accent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness
that is quite disarming.  A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and
waves George in.

<b>INT. NY IMPROV, BAR - 1975 - NIGHT
</b>
The bar is packed with COMICS and SHOW BIZ TYPES.  A few
turn and smile -- "George!"  "Hey, George!"  George takes a
couple hands, whispers to someone else, then drifts into
the...

<b>INT. NY IMPROV, SHOWROOM - 1975 - NIGHT
</b>
Where the show's in progress.  Owner BUDD FRIEDMAN sees
George and gives him a bear-hug.  Then he hustles George to
a table.

George sits -- and gives the stage his undivided attention.
Up there is a WISEASS COMIC.

<b>ttWISEASS COMIC
</b>tSo I'm getting my mother-in-law a
tspecial Christmas present: A pre-
tpaid funeral!  The mortician asked
tme if I wanted her buried, embalmed
tor cremated.  I said, "Make it all
tthree!  I'm not takin' any chances!"
tt(the crowd LAUGHS)
tThank you.  Good night!
The comic waves and exits.  APPLAUSE.  George politely
claps.  A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune.

We think there's a break... when Andy suddenly, awkwardly
steps on stage.  He is in character as Foreign Man.  Pink
jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in
headlights.  He puts down his big case, pulls out various
junk, and arranges it on chairs.

The room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is.
Andy tentatively grabs the mike.  The stagefright is agony.

<b>ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
</b>tNow?  Now...?
tt(looking around)
tTank you veddy much.  I am very
thappy to be here.  I tink -- this is
ta very beautiful place.  But one
tting I do not like is too much
ttraffic.  Tonight I had to come
tfrom, eh, and the freeway, it was so
tmuch traffic.  It took me an hour
tand a half to get here!

Andy chuckles, as if this were a punchline.

Silence.  The crowd is baffled.

ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
tBut -- talking about the terrible
tthings: My wife.  Take my wife,
tplease take her.

Yikes.  A few NERVOUS LAUGHS.

Andy gestures, as if they got the joke.

ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
tNo really, I am only foolink.  I
tlove my wife very much.  But she
tdon't know how to cook.  You know,
tone time, she make a steak and
tmashed potato.  Ehh, and the night
tbefore, she make spaghetti and
tmeatballs.  Her cooking is so bad...
tis terrible.

People are embarrassed.  Some avert their eyes.  A couple
hipsters laugh mockingly.

George leans forward.  Andy wipes the sweat from his brow.
tt     ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
tRight now, I would like to do for
tyou some imitations.  So first, I
twould like to imitate Archie Bunker.
tt(no change in his
ttvoice)
t"You stupid, everybody ees stupid!
tEhh, get, get out of my chair
tMeathead... go in the, eh, Dingbat
tget into the kitchen, making the
tfood!  Ehh, everybody ees stupid!  I
tdon't like nobody, ees so stupid!"
tTank you veddy much.
tt(pleased, he proudly
ttbows)
tNow I would like to imitate Jimmy
tCarter, the President of the United
tStates.
tt(no change in his
ttvoice)
t"Hello, I am Jimmy Carter, the
tPresident of the United States."

Some people BOO and walk out.  A few giggle, getting into
the groove.

George is intrigued.

ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
tAnd now... I would like to imitate
tthe Elvis Presley.

A woman LAUGHS caustically.  Andy grins stupidly, then turns
his back to us.  He presses "Play" on a CASSETTE RECORDER...
and the THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.

House lights dim dramatically.  With a flourish, Andy pulls
tape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones.  He removes his
pink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket.

He combs his hair.

Then he brushes his hair.

Then he combs his hair some more.

Finally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins
around.

He is ELVIS.  CONFIDENT.  SEXY.  LIP CURL.  DEAD-ON PERFECT.

The crowd is blown away.

Vegas Elvis INTRO MUSIC suddenly blasts.  Andy/Elvis
swaggers stage left and takes a bow.  Then he goes stage
right and takes a bow.  Then he returns stage left for
another bow.

Music STOPS.

<b>ttANDY (AS ELVIS)
</b>tThank you very much.

Wow.  Flabbergasted, people APPLAUD.  This man is Elvis.

Suddenly -- "JAILHOUSE ROCK" guitar kicks in.

ttANDY (AS ELVIS) (cont'd)
<b>tt(SINGING)
</b>t"Warden threw a party
tIn the county jail!
tPrison band was there
tAnd they BEGAN to WAIL!"

<b>ANGLE - GEORGE
</b>
He is astonished.  George cannot quite figure out what's
going on... but he wants in.

He waves Budd over.  Budd leans down, and George WHISPERS.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tPst.  What's the story with this
tguy?

<b>ttBUDD
</b>tI think he's Lithuanian.  None of us
tcan understand him.

George nods admiringly.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tHe does a hell of an Elvis.

<b>ttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. NY IMPROV, BACKSTAGE - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
Andy is packing up his things.  He very methodically folds
each item of clothing, then checks the creases.

George strolls up.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tHey, I really enjoyed your set.

<b>ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
</b>tTank you veddy much.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tSo I understand you're from
tLithuania?

<b>ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
</b>tNo.  Caspiar.

George is puzzled.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tCaspiar?  I haven't heard of that.

<b>ttANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
</b>tIt's a veddy small island in de
tCaspian Sea.
tt(beat)
tIt sunk.
<b>tt GEORGE
</b>tOh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.
tt(beat)
tWell, look, I'm probably out of my
tmind -- but I think you're very
tinteresting.  If you ever need
trepresentation... we should talk.

George hands him a BUSINESS CARD.  Andy reads it -- then his
eyes pop.  He DROPS the accent.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tMr. Shapiro, it's an honor!!

George realizes it's all been an act.  He laughs heartily.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tCaspiar, huh?!

<b>ttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. SOHO HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
A Bohemian health food restaurant, staffed by hippie
waitresses in sandals.  Andy and George sit together, trying
to get a sense of each other.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tYou see, I want to be the biggest
tstar in the world.

George is surprised at this hubris.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tPeople love... comedians.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI'm not a comedian.  I have no
ttalent.
tt(he shrugs)
tI'm a song-and-dance man.

George looks up at Andy -- and inexplicably there is a giant
MOIST BOOGER hanging from Andy's nostril.

George cringes.  He doesn't know what to say.

A waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's HEALTH FOOD
-- seaweed, beans, stringy paste.  George frowns.  Andy
beams.

ttANDY (cont'd)
tMmm!  I particularly recommend the
tLotus root.

Andy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands.
Then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little
piles: Beans in pinwheel shapes.  Sprouts in piles.

George peers at the bizarre food behavior.
<b>tt   GEORGE
</b>tYou show a lot of promise... but...
tmy concern is I don't know where to
tbook you.  You're not a stand-up...
tyour act doesn't exactly translate
tto films... help me... where do you
tsee yourself?

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(bright)
tI've always wanted to play Carnegie
tHall.

George is unsure if that's a joke.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tYeah, ha-ha.  That's funny.

Andy dips his silverware in the water glass.  Two dunks,
then he dries it with his napkin.

George stares, perplexed.  He looks back up -- and Andy's
booger has suddenly switched nostrils.

Huh?

<b>ttANDY
</b>tSee, I don't want easy laughs.

Andy's about to eat -- but first bows his head in silent
prayer.  George raises an eyebrow.  Andy snaps his head back
up.

ttANDY (cont'd)
tI want gut reactions!  I want that
taudience to go through an
texperience.  They love me!  They
thate me!  They walk out -- it's all
<b>tGREAT!
</b>
Andy triumphantly eats a bean.  George peers, unable to take
the booger anymore.  He hands Andy a napkin and points to
his nose.  Andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and
carefully puts it in a little box.

ttANDY (cont'd)
tAfter I'm famous, I can sell these
tas "Worn by Andy Kaufman."

And at that... George is won over.  He smiles broadly.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tYou're insane.
tt(then sincere)
tBut -- you might also be brilliant.
tAlright, Andy... let's do it.

George warmly extends his hand.

Andy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand.  The men
shake.  A moment of supreme importance.
<b>EST. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY
</b>
The glitz strip of Los Angeles.  Money.  Beauty.

<b>INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY
</b>
Real working showbiz offices.  No glamour at all.  It looks
more like an insurance agency.

George sits in his office, reassuring someone on the phone.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tSammy, opening for David Brenner is
ta fine gig.  You'll be on the
troad... get some exposure...

O.S., a SECRETARY shouts out.

<b>ttSECRETARY (O.S.)

</b>tWho?

<b>ttSECRETARY (O.S.)
</b>tHe says he's an associate of Andy

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tOh.
tt(back to the phone)
tSammy, think about it.  I gotta go.
tt(he punches a line)
tHello?  George Shapiro here.

On the phone, a STACCATO, ABRASIVE NASAL VOICE blares.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
</b>tUh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tt(beat)
tEr, yes.  Speaking.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
</b>t"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking,
tcreaking... Freaking!

George is baffled.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tCan I help you with something?

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
</b>tYeah!  You stay away from that Andy
tKaufman, if you know what's good for

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tt(stunned)
tWho is this?
<b>ttTONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
</b>tYou -- you know damn straight who it

tBeer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
</b>tKaufman's a lying bastard!  If you

CLICK.  Clifton hangs up.  George is bewildered.

<b>INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
The light is magical.  Soothing SITAR music plays.  Andy and
fifteen other BAREFOOT STUDENTS sit on mats in a semi-
circle.  Eyes shut, bodies in different yoga positions, they
are all meditating.

Facing them on a throne-like chair sits a reverent, Indian
YOGI.  At his feet is the class teacher, LITTLE WENDY, a
teeny lady with an absurdly high-pitched voice.

<b>ttLITTLE WENDY
</b>tNow, while continuing your deep
tbreathing, slowly open your eyes.
tYou should feel rested, relaxed, and
talert.

The students all open their eyes.

<b>ttYOGI
</b>tDo any thoughts come...?

<b>ttSTUDENT #1
</b>tMy mind is clear.  I feel great.

<b>ttYOGI
</b>tGood...

<b>ttSTUDENT #2
</b>tAll the tension is gone from my
tbody.

The Yogi's eyes go to Andy.  Andy smiles sweetly.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI want to thank you, your Holiness.
tMy heart is radiating with pure
tenergy.

The Yogi nods kindly.

<b>ttYOGI
</b>tYou always had a good heart.  But
tI'm proud of the progress you've
tmade in your discipline.
<b>tt  ANDY
</b>tYes.  TM got me focused.  In fact,
tmy manager got me a TV gig!  It's
tjust some new show with no budget,
tbut I'm still excited.

Oh.  The Yogi peers intently.

<b>ttYOGI
</b>tAre you at peace with your family?

<b>ttANDY
</b>tUm, yes.  I haven't fought with
tthem, since I started here.

<b>ttYOGI
</b>tGoals are important.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI stopped drinking.  I gave up
tdrugs.  And I'm meditating three
thours a day.  It's the center of my
tlife...

<b>ttYOGI
</b>tWe are all impressed.

Andy smiles beatifically.  This means a lot.

<b>ttLITTLE WENDY
</b>tOkay.  Anyone else --?

<b>ttANDY
</b>tOh, wait!  I have a question.
tt(beat; working up
tthis nerve)
tIs there... is there a secret to
tbeing funny?

Huh?  The Yogi thinks hard... squinching up his face.
Then... he finally speaks.

<b>ttYOGI
</b>tYes.  Silence.

<b>ttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. SNL SET - NIGHT
</b>
An AUDIENCE sits, waiting for the commercial to end.
TECHIES tweak lights.  CAMERAMEN get ready.

Sitting in VIP seats are Andy's FAMILY.  Stanley and Janice
are in their late 50's, Michael and Carol in their 20's.
They're all anxious.

<b>ttCAROL
</b>tI still can't believe my brother's
tgonna be on TV...!

<b>ttJANICE
</b>tI hope he doesn't get nervous.
<b>tt    STANLEY
</b>tWhat's the difference?  This thing's
ton in the middle of the night -- no
tone's even gonna see it.

The commercial ends, and the "APPLAUSE" sign blinks.  The
crowd APPLAUDS.  An "ON THE AIR" sign lights up.

<b>ttHOST
</b>tWelcome back to Saturday Night Live!
tAnd now, as a special treat on our
tfirst show... musical guest ANDY
<b>tKAUFMAN!!!
</b>
The SNL orchestra starts the intro into a song.  Andy enters
the stage with a boom box, and positions himself in front of
the microphone.  When the vocals are supposed to start, Andy
doesn't open his mouth.  Instead he looks around --
frightened.  The band stops... and starts again.  Andy
remains mute.  The Band stops again.

<b>INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT
</b>
The SNL producer, LORNE MICHAELS, looks worried.

<b>ttLORNE MICHAELS
</b>tWhat's happening to him?

<b>INT. SNL SET - NIGHT
</b>
At that moment, Andy puts the boom box down and blares it
loudly.  The THEME FROM "MIGHTY MOUSE" plays -- but Andy
just blankly stands there.

He's purposefully doing nothing.

<b>ttMIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.)
</b>t"Although we are in danger,
t We never despair,
t Because we know where there is
tdanger
t He is there!"

The audience is puzzled.  The Kaufmans are alarmed.

<b>INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT
</b>
Lorne Michaels is panicked.

<b>ttLORNE MICHAELS
</b>tOh my God, he's doing nothing.  It's
tdead air...!

<b>INT. SNL SET - NIGHT
</b>
<b>BACK ON ANDY.
</b>
<b>ttMIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.)
</b>t"We're not worrying at all.
t We're just listening for his
tcall..."
Then SUDDENLY -- Andy comes to life and triumphantly LIP
<b>SYNCS.
</b>
ttMIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.) (cont'd)
t"Here I come to save the day!"

Shocked, the crowd HOWLS with LAUGHTER.

Then instantly -- Andy resumes his blank expression.

ttMIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.) (cont'd)
t"That means that Mighty Mouse is on
tthe way!"

The audience SCREAMS with glee.  The tune ENDS, and the
audience APPLAUDS CRAZILY.

Delighted, Andy grins and bows.

The Kaufmans clap the hardest.  Stanley locks eyes with
Andy... and the beaming father smiles the proudest of all.

<b>ttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY
</b>
George jumps from his desk.  Andy is walking in.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tAndy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin'

<b>ttANDY
</b>tThe stewardess let me keep my
theadphones.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tThat's... terrific!  But I got

ttmoment)
tYou are getting a once-in-a-
tlifetime, unbelievably lucrative
topportunity to star on... a
<b>tPRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
</b>
Andy's smile drops.  He freezes up.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tSitcom...?

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tAnd this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the
tguys who did the Mary Tyler Moore
tand Bob Newhart shows!  It takes

tgonna be the Fonzie!

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(confused)
tI'm -- Fonzie?
<b>tt     GEORGE
</b>tNO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout

tkids impersonate and put on their
tlunchboxes!

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(soft)
tGeorge, I hate sitcoms.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tHANG ON, you ain't heard the best
tpart!  ABC has seen your foreign man
tcharacter, and they want to turn him
tinto --
tt(he checks his
ttnotes)
t"Latka," a lovable, goofy
tmechanic!!!

Long pause.  Then -- Andy responds.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tNo.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>t"No"?  "No" to which part??

<b>ttANDY
</b>tNo to the whole thing.  None of it
tsounds good.

George is flummoxed.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tAndy... this is every comedian's
tdream.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI told you, I'm not a comedian.  And
tsitcoms are the lowest form of
tentertainment: Stupid jokes and
tcanned laughter.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tt(shocked)
tB-but, this is classy... they did
tBob Newha--

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI'm not interested.  I want to
tcreate my own material.

Beat.  George glares.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tYou have to do it.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI refuse.

<b>tt   GEORGE
</b>tt(he explodes)
tLISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've
tbeen in this business for twenty
tyears!  I know!  If you walk away
tfrom this opportunity, you will
tnever, NEVER see another one like it
tagain!!!!

Long pause.  Andy stares at George, amazed at this passion.

Then Andy gets up and looks around the office.  He stares at
the awards... the gold records... emblems of success and
experience.

Andy thinks -- then nods.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tOkay.  Fine, I'll do it.
tt(beat)
tBut I have a few terms.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tt(relieved)
tOf course!  That's what negotiations
tare for.

Andy starts to write on a piece of paper.

ttGEORGE (cont'd)
tWhat are you doing?

<b>ttANDY
</b>tWriting down my terms.

George watches patiently.

Andy clicks his pen, done.  George smiles and takes the
list.  He scans it... then his face gets totally befuddled.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tAre you makin' fun of me --?  This
tis RIDICULOUS!

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(blas&#1081;)
tThose are my terms.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tThey're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!
tt(he points at one
ttitem)
tI mean -- "two guaranteed guest
tshots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is
tthis TONY CLIFTON?!

<b>ttANDY
</b>tHe's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to
tdo impressions of him.  We sorta...
tgot in a fight over that.

George gets a look.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tThis Clifton called me up.  He's a
tloon!  He HATES you!
<b>tt     ANDY
</b>tNah, he just talks tough.  But I owe

Andy smiles ingenuously, then turns stern.

ttANDY (cont'd)
tIf I'm the new Fonz... ABC's just
tgonna have to give me what I want.
tt(a sarcastic FONZIE
<b>ttIMPRESSION)
</b>tHeyyyyyy!

George winces.  He stares at the list.

<b>INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY
</b>
George sits across a conference table from three NETWORK
SUITS.  He stoically reads the men his demands.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tMr. Kaufman will only appear in half
tthe episodes.
tt(beat)
tMr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed
t90 minutes of meditation prior to
tfilming.
tt(beat)
tMr. Kaufman won't rehearse.
tt(beat)
tMr. Kaufman gets his own network

The execs are stupefied.  Finally -- George delivers the
clincher.

ttGEORGE (cont'd)
tAnd Taxi must guarantee two guest
tappearances to... Tony Clifton.

<b>ttNETWORK GUYS
</b><b>tWHO???
</b>
<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tTony Clifton.

<b>ttNETWORK GUY #1
</b>tWho is he?!

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tt(solemn)
tI don't know.

Long pause.  The execs stare at George like he's lost his
mind.

ttGEORGE (cont'd)
tBut Andy says he's fabulous.
tt(awkward)
tHe also says, these are the terms.

The execs' leader, MAYNARD SMITH, shudders hopelessly.

<b>tt    NETWORK GUY #2
</b>tCouldn't Kaufman ask for more money,
tlike everyone else?

George slowly, sadly shakes his head:  No.

Maynard glances at his team -- then frowns.

ttMAYNARD (cont'd)
tGeorge, we don't book phantom
tperformers.  The deal's off.

<b>INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY
</b>
GEORGE throws his attach&#1081; case on the desk, then slumps into
his chair.  He picks up the phone and dials.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tAndy?

<b>ttANDY (O.S.)
</b>tHi George!

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tEh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony

<b>ttANDY (O.S.)
</b>tOf course.

tBut only on Monday nights.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tThat's alright.  Where...?

<b>INT. MAMA ROMA'S - NIGHT
</b>
Mama Roma's, a dark Italian restaurant with red booths, wise
guys, and cigarette smoke.

The Maitre'd guides George to a booth.  A small BAND fills
the "stage" -- a six-foot space in the back of the room.

The lights dim.  A BLARING ANNOUNCER speaks.

<b>ttANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>tAnd now, Mama Roma's is proud to
tpresent International Singing
tSensation... a man who has sold more
trecords than Elvis and the Beatles
tcombined...

George is skeptical.

ttANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd)
tLadies and Gentlemen, Mr.
tEntertainment... TONY CLIFTON!

The DRUMMER starts a drum roll.  Patrons APPLAUD.  A LIGHT
SPOT hits the entrance area... and nobody enters.  The spot
is waiting... waiting... still waiting... until the drum
roll slows down and stops.  The announcer BOOMS again.
tt     ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd)
tLadies and Gentlemen, out of respect
tfor Mr. Clifton's vocal demands,
tcould everyone please extinguish
tyour cigarettes and cigars.

The crowd GRUMBLES angrily -- then irritably complies.  One
ANGRY GUY thrusts his cigar into a water glass.

<b>ttANGRY GUY
</b>tGoddamn, I paid five dollars for
tthis.

<b>ttANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>tAnd now!  A man who needs no
tintroduction... TONY CLIFTON!

The band starts playing lounge standard "VOLARE".  And then,
obnoxious TONY CLIFTON swaggers out.  Tony has a rubbery
face, black wig and moustache, sunglasses, a padded belly,
and a peach tuxedo with blue shirt and velvet piping.

Tony stops, smirks at the audience, and sucks on a
cigarette.  He blows smoke rings at them.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tHeh-heh.  How ya all doin'?

The crowd is furious.

<b>ttANGRY GUY
</b>tFuck you!

People light back up and start talking.  Tony ignores the
ruckus.  He starts SINGING, pinched and off-key.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tt(singing)
t"Volare!
t Whoa, whoa.
t Cantare,
t Whoa whoa whoa whoa."

George winces.  He's horrible.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
tt(singing)
t"I got the wings of your love,
t I got the wings of a dove.
t I got the... uh...
tt(forgetting the
ttwords)

t Eh, Kentucky Fried..."

The band is lost.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
t Oh.  Whoop do doo,
t Whoop de di,
t Stick a needle in your eye...

The band gives up and stops.
tt    TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
tEh, the hell with that song.

One person CLAPS.  Most BOO.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
tSo how ya doin'!

tHow ya doin' over here?  How ya
tdoin' over there?
tt(he approaches a

</b>tHow's that pasta carbonara?

<b>ttWOMAN
</b>tLeave me alone.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tOkay!
tt(he spins around)
tSo, you havin' a good time, sir?!

Tony approaches a LONELY SAD SACK sitting at the bar.  Tony
thrusts his mike at the guy.

<b>ttSAD SACK
</b>tSure...

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tWhat's your name?

<b>ttSAD SACK
</b>tBob.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON

t"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.

tBob what?

<b>ttSAD SACK
</b>tBob Gorsky.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>t"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?

<b>ttSAD SACK
</b>tt(meek)

Tony gets indignant.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tAre you tryin' to do some of that

</b>tSHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!

People are embarrassed.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
tI do a clean show!  Like, I wouldn't
tdo that one... oh, you know it...
t"What do you call a pretty girl in
tPoland"?

tA -- a tourist.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tSee, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin'
tabout!
tt(enraged)
tHere!  I'LL give you a little humor!

Tony snatches Bob's water glass and POURS IT over his head!

George is appalled.  The crowd is aghast.  Bob is wet.
People BOO AND HURL THINGS.

Bob starts weeping, then bolts up and runs from the
building.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
tAnd stay out, Fatso!

The room erupts, outraged.  George covers his face, looking
ill.  Suddenly, Tony snaps at him.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tAnd YOU.  I wanna see you backstage!

George is rattled.

<b>INT. MAMA ROMA'S, KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
The kitchen staff is working.  George wanders around... then
finally spots Tony, back to us, eating pasta at the
employees' table.  Aggravated, George aggressively steps up.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tAlright, I'm here.  What do you
twant?

Tony puts down his fork.  He pauses... slowly turns
around... and is Andy.

George GASPS.  His eyes bulge.

Andy smiles innocently.  He gestures to an empty seat.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tAre you hungry?

George is breathing heavily, like someone about to have a
heart attack.  His brain melting, he shakily reaches for a
chair and sits.  George glances down.  Lying alongside the
food is Tony's rubber face.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tI... I-I don't understand this act.
<b>tt   ANDY
</b>tt(in jolly spirits)
tIt's good old-fashioned
tentertainment.  Everyone loves a

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tYeah?  Well tell that to the poor
tschlub who you humiliated!

Beat -- then Bob strolls over.  His real name is BOB ZMUDA.

<b>ttZMUDA
</b>tHey Andy, good show.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tOh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob
tand I have been buddies for years.

George gapes.  On closer inspection, Bob is cocky, aloof,
and conniving.  He and Andy grin naughtily at each other.

<b>ttZMUDA
</b>tThat was a really hot house!

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tSo your name's not Gorsky.

<b>ttZMUDA
</b>tDon't believe everything you hear.

George thinks about this -- then laughs.

<b>INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY
</b>
Maynard and the ABC suits sit at the table, mesmerized.
George is confidentially whispering to them.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tThis has to stay in the room... but
there's the thing: Andy is Tony.  And
tTony is Andy!  They'll deny it up
tand down, but I swear to God,

tt(with urgency)
tIt's smart business!  You'll get two

Maynard thinks about this, quite methodically.  A beat, and
then he cracks a smile...

<b>INT. ALPHA BETA SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
</b>
1 a.m. in the supermarket.  Just a few people linger...
including Andy, who's at the Space Invaders videogame.  Andy
stares intently at the screen, eyes piercing, fingers
hammering the buttons while he blows up Martians.  Andy is
oblivious to all around him.

In the b.g., George suddenly enters.  He looks around the
market, then spots Andy.  He feverishly runs up.
<b>tt   GEORGE
</b>tAndy!

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(still playing the

tWhat's up?

George grins crazily, ecstatically.

<b>ttGEORGE

slowly smiles sweetly.  Genuinely.

(The actual TAXI scene will be determined.)  JUDD HIRSCH,
TONY DANZA, and MARILU HENNER read their lines.

Then... a bored BLACK STAND-IN reads Latka's line.

The cast glances around.  Tony Danza loses his temper.

<b>ttTONY DANZA

One producer stands.  This is tightly-wound ED WEINBERGER.

An angry beat.  The actors resume...

Judd is surprised.

<b>INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Andy is meditating.  He's tranquil, at total inner peace.

Silence -- until a little clock radio CHIRPS.

Andy snaps his eyes open.  He exhales a few calm breaths,
then sits upright.  Andy reaches for a sealed envelope, rips
it open, and removes a SCRIPT.

Andy sighs, opens the script, and starts scanning the pages
like a speedreader.

<b>INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
Bleachers are full.  They're now filming TAXI (the same
scene as earlier).  On cue, Andy enters as LATKA -- wide-
eyed, endearing, in mechanic's overalls.

Andy is hilarious.  The crowd HOWLS with laughter.

<b>MONTAGE - TAXI
</b>
In quick succession, a series of Andy's best Latka moments.
He's beloved.  The applause grows louder, louder, LOUDER...

<b>ttTECHNICIAN
</b><b>tNO!

of candles.

The technician pushes a button.  ON THE MONITOR - Andy's
image briefly appears.

<b>ttt  ANDY (ON-SCREEN)
</b>tAnd now... in her television debut,

At that moment, Andy's image starts rolling across the
screen, until it disappears into a blur of static...

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(happy)
tIt'll be great.  The viewer will
tthink their TV is broken.  They'll

<b>ttMAYNARD
</b>tAndy... we don't want the viewer to
tget out of their chair.  They might

<b>ttANDY
</b>tBut it's funny!  It's a practical

Andy beams giddily.  Maynard gazes dully, struggling to
reason.

Both men quickly extend their hands and shake.  Maynard nods
and leaves.

Beat.  Then, Andy pulls out a Handi-wipe and cleans his
palm.

A STUDIO PAGE walks over.  He has a huge MAIL BAG.

<b>ttSTUDIO PAGE
</b>tMr. Kaufman, do you want your mail?

Andy looks up -- and his face lights up like Christmas.

<b>INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Andy's crappy apartment, which looks like a dorm room: Cheap
furniture, stained carpet, and a framed photo of the
Maharishi.  Andy lies on his bed, which is covered with
THOUSANDS OF LETTERS.  He happily chats on the phone.

<b>ttANDY
</b>t... Yes, it's Andy Kaufman!...
tReally! ...I got your fan letter...
tSo you like the show?  Your letter

tIt was real nice of you to send your

tYou'll be SORRY!  One day I'm gonna
tOWN this town!!

Tony SCREAMS and gets removed.  Dead silence.  Then --

<b>ttED
</b>tI don't want those pictures getting
tout.

<b>ttSECURITY GUARD
</b>tt(to the reporter)
tThis is a closed set.  You'll have
tto give me the film in that camera.

The Guard reaches for the camera.  An uncertain moment...
until Zmuda authoritatively cuts in, from out of nowhere.

<b>ttZMUDA
</b>tI'll take care of this.

Zmuda takes the camera.  He casually starts to make his way
for the exit... when Ed suddenly HOLLERS.

<b>ttED
</b>tWait -- he's one of THEM!

Zmuda gasps.  Two guards go running for him.

Zmuda barrels away, trying to escape.  The guards chase.
Zmuda races by George, and suddenly palms off the camera
into George's arms.  The guards whip by, oblivious.

George grimaces, unclear about his loyalties.  He sweatily
peers at the timebomb in his hands.

And then -- George thrusts it under his jacket.  He bolts
for the door and feverishly scampers out.

<b>EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT - DAY
</b>
George runs for his life.  He knocks aside a rack of
costumes and serpentines between people.

At the gate, Tony's being dragged, kicking and screaming.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tStop!  HELP!  You wouldn't do this
tto Wayne Newton --

The guards toss Tony out the gate.  He lands in a heap.

In the b.g., George crazily flies by.  He gets out the exit.

<b>EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT, OUTSIDE THE GATES - DAY
</b>
George doubles over, trying to catch his breath.  He glances
down... and Tony is lying next to him.  Little Wendy and
Zmuda run up, out of breath.

They all look at each other.  There's a moment of
understanding.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tHey.  Good hustlin'.

George slowly smiles.

<b>ttSECRETARY
</b>tUm, Ed... you have a phone call --

<b>ttED
</b><b>tI'M NOT IN!
</b>
<b>ttSECRETARY
</b>tWell, um... it's Andy Kaufman...

Heh??!  Shaking with fury, Ed stares at the telephone...
then slowly picks it up.

<b>ttED
</b>tYeah???

A long pause... then Andy's voice calmly speaks.

<b>ttANDY (V.O.)
</b>tYou were brilliant.

A flabbergasted beat.

<b>ttED

He thinks intently about this.  And then... amazingly, a
magnificent smiles comes over his face.

<b>ttED
</b>tWell -- thank you.

George is driving in his convertible.  Suddenly, something
catches his eye -- and in shock he HITS the brakes.  Three
cars behind him SCREECH crazily, trying not to hit each
other.

George is oblivious.  He's staring up at a BILLBOARD.
The BILLBOARD: It says "HARRAH'S TAHOE PRESENTS, ANDY
<b>KAUFMAN & TONY CLIFTON!  TOGETHER ON STAGE!  ONE NIGHT
</b><b>ONLY!"
</b>
George is flabbergasted.

<b>ttBOOKER (O.S.)
</b>tSure it is.  Tony called me himself.
tHe yelled at me, insisting that his

George is stupefied.  He looks at his watch.

<b>ttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. LAKE TAHOE - DUSK
</b>
Magnificent HARRAH'S dominates the skyline.  The marquee
blares "TONY CLIFTON AND ANDY KAUFMAN!"  George screeches up
in a rental car.  He jumps out and runs inside.

<b>INT. HARRAH'S SHOWROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The showroom is packed.  It hums with curiosity.  WAITERS
clean off the dinner tables.  George rushes in and is seated
in a far booth, with some STRANGERS.  He overhears a heated
conversation between a PUSHY MAN and his WIFE.

<b>ttPUSHY MAN
</b>tYou're not listenin'!  It's a VERY
tsimple concept.

<b>ttWIFE OF PUSHY MAN
</b>tYou're making no sense.  How can
tthey be the same person --?

<b>ttPUSHY MAN
</b>tTrust me!  You'll never see them on
tstage at the same time!

The onstage ORCHESTRA hits a fanfare.  LIGHTS DIM.  Sharp
SPOTLIGHTS meet at the foot of the stage.  Suddenly -- Tony
swaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph.

Thunderous APPLAUSE.  Tony beams.  The music stops.

George leans in, curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of
this.

Tony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra,
and waits.  The NOISE LEVEL slowly drops -- but not
entirely.  Tony waits, and waits, and waits... until
suddenly he turns towards the audience and SCREAMS
<b>FURIOUSLY.
</b>
<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b><b>tSHUT UP!!!!!!
</b>
Everybody looks up, alarmed.  The general murmur almost
dies.  Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all
the unruly people.  As they quiet down... Tony turns back to
the orchestra and raises his arms.  The MUSICIANS lift their
instruments.  Silence is total -- except for the clank of
china.

Waiters are serving coffee.

Tony spins back around, livid.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
<b>tTHAT APPLIES TO YOU, TOO,
</b><b>tPENGUINS!!!
</b>
People signal "shh"!  The waiters realize Tony's addressing
them, and they stare back in disbelief!  This is their job!

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
tYeah!  Yeah!  YOU!  I'm talkin' to
tYOU!!  And you better freeze, or
tI'll get your asses fired!!!

Tony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze.  The
waiters stand there like statues, staring in terror.

Satisfied, Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his
arms.  Again, the musicians lift their instruments.  In
anticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about.
Audience members start whispering.  Tony hears this -- and
drops his arms and head in despair.

The musicians lower their instruments.  Tony waits for
absolute silence.  Only then does he signal the musicians to
get ready again.  They do.  And then at that precise moment
-- somebody DROPS a spoon.
Tony jolts, as if hit by a current.  He drops his hands
again, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look.
Then he turns again, lowers his head, and waits.  And waits.
And waits.

The man at George's table WHISPERS to his wife.

<b>ttPUSHY MAN
</b>tHe's never gonna start!  Kaufman
tthinks this is funny!
tt(beat)
tWe've paid forty bucks for a show
tthat's never gonna start!

George grins stupidly.  The silence is now deafening.
Slowly, very slowly, Tony raises his arms.  Slowly... the
musicians get their instruments ready.  Tony stands there,
and stands, and stands, waiting for something... anything...
to disturb the silence.  In vain.  Somebody COUGHS.  The
whole scene repeats itself.

Finally -- finally -- Tony is surrounded by total silence.
Then, (only a moment before the length of this scene would
become unbearable), he begins to move.  Tony pivots around,
looks at the audience...

And the entire room looks like Tussaud's Wax Museum.  Tony
starts LAUGHING hysterically.  The audience's reaction is
mixed:

Some people LAUGH.  Some BOO.  Some ask perplexed questions.
Some SCREAM OBSCENITIES.  Some even APPLAUD.

Tony is very happy.  He turns to the orchestra, raises his
baton -- and commences the downbeat!  The MUSIC BEGINS.

A SPOTLIGHT hits the wings... and then ANDY STRIDES OUT.

George's jaw drops.

<b>ttWIFE OF PUSHY MAN
</b>tYou see!  I told you!  They're not
tthe same person!

The whole audience BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE.  Life is back to
normal.  Andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a
prepared row of congas.  He starts to play.

Tony Clifton grabs the microphone.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tThank you!  Thank you!  I wrote this
ttune for my friend Frank Sinatra.
tHe had a nice little success with
tit... but forgot to thank me on the
talbum.

He starts to BELT "I Gotta Be Me".

George squints his eyes, trying to figure out who this is.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
t"Whether I'm right
t Or whether I'm wrong
t Whether I find a place in this
tworld
t Or never belong!
t I gotta be me!  I gotta be me!
t What else can I be, but what I am?"

Tony's singing is awful.  Andy happily accompanies on
congas.  The audience doesn't know what to think.

Tony's SINGING reaches the end... aggressive and off-key.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
tLet's bring it on home --
tt(he hits his
ttscreeching CLIMAX)

George wanders the corridor, looking for the dressing rooms.
He turns and finds a door marked "KAUFMAN".  Next to it is a
door marked "CLIFTON".

George stares.  He thinks, then opens the "KAUFMAN" door.

Andy is inside alone, gathering his things.  He's pleasantly
surprised to see George.

George doesn't enter.  He goes to the "CLIFTON" door.  Andy
follows.  George opens the mystery door...

George starts hyperventilating.  Shaking, he tries to sit
himself down.  Andy enters, beaming.  George is amazed.

</b>tYou're so proud.  You're like some

Andy excitedly jumps up and down.

Hmm.  Andy contemplates this.

him, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this
experience.  Andy immediately grabs her by the legs and
flips her over.

WHUMP!  She's down.  Andy has trained for this.

Zmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official.
Lynne struggles and slithers away.

She grabs Andy's arm and forces him down.  People CHEER.
His torso hits the mat.  LOUDER CHEERS.  But suddenly he
rolls over and pulls her hair!  Her head snaps back.  The
crowd is INCENSED.  Zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a
stern warning.

Andy nods, and they separate.  They do a little dance around
the ring, Lynne looking for a hole.  Suddenly, Andy spins
her into a Half-Nelson.  Her arms are pinned.  They
struggle, then he throws her down on her stomach.  One!

</b>tPopcorn?

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tNo thanks.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI really want one.

tOne large tub of popcorn, please,

The CANDY GIRL makes Andy his popcorn.  He pays... then
heads to the exit.

ttANDY (cont'd)
tOkay.  Let's go.

Lynne is baffled.

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tAndy, the theater's that way!

</b>tHey, I love movie theater popcorn...

tfrom was you.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tGosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tYou were impressed with something.
tIt's pretty odd when a man sports a

Andy is shocked.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tOh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tI'm here, ain't I?

A charged moment.  Andy's eyes widen.  His speech gets
faster.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tDo you wanna to go to Memphis and
tget married?

<b>ttLYNNE

tDo I wanna go to Memphis and get

</b>tWhy Memphis?

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(he SPEAKS VERY

tIf you want...

<b>INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, MEMPHIS - NIGHT

The arena is filled with furious BOOING SOUTHERN WRESTLING
FANS.  Ladies in hair nets.  Men clutching beer cans.  This
is a rougher crowd than we've seen before.

Andy stands in the ring, unshaven in a torn green robe.
He's screaming at them.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(screaming)
<b>tSHUT UP!
</b>tt(more BOOS)
tSHUT UP!  Show some respect!  I want

tIf any woman can defeat me, I will
tpay her 1000 dollars!  Then I'll
tshave my head bald!  And then as a
tbonus -- that lucky lady will get to
tmarry me!!

Screeching JEERS and CATCALLS.  Down front... Lynne jumps
up.

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tLook here, Andy Kaufman!  I'll take
tyou on -- SISSY!

The mob LAUGHS harshly.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tOoo, the little lady's upset.  Well
tI say -- get back in the kitchen!

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tt("outraged")
tNo!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm
tgonna make you dry my dishes!

The crowd APPLAUDS.  Lynne grins and starts to climb in the
ring.  Andy's eyes are ablaze.  But suddenly -- an oversized
Southern MAN jumps in and snatches the mike away.

<b>ttMAN
</b>tSTOP IT!  This woman's a FAKE!
tShe's nothing but Kaufman's
tgirlfriend!

Andy and Lynne are startled.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tT-that's not true --

<b>ttMAN
</b>tIt's a set-up!  And I won't allow
tour great sport to be degraded by a
tfix!!

The crowd angrily starts to HISS.  Lynne whispers to Andy.

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tAndy... who is that...?

<b>ttLAWLER
</b>tI'm Jerry Lawler, the KING of
tMemphis wrestling!!
tt(this gets HUGE
<b>ttCHEERS)
</b>tSo if Kaufman wants to tangle, I've
tbrought a real wrestler!  She's
ttrained and she's READY!!  Kaufman,
tdo you think you can handle... FOXY
<b>tJACKSON???!!!
</b>
At that, a striking, muscular black woman stands -- FOXY.

The coliseum SCREAMS with excitement.  People POUND their
seats.  The roar is deafening.  Lawler gleams cockily.
Lynne looks worriedly at Andy -- he's concerned.

<b>ttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
DING!  The bell rings.  Foxy comes out, ready to brawl.  But
Andy remains in his corner, running down the clock.  He
nonchalantly peels off his robe.  Foxy dances around
impatiently.  Andy casually removes a towel from his neck.
People BOO.  Still stalling, Andy then takes off his watch.

People SCREAM so furiously they're red-faced.  Andy is
tormenting them.  A TATTOOED GUY jumps up.

<b>ttTATTOOED GUY
</b>tAre you scared???

Andy sneers.  He cracks his knuckles, finally walks over...
and commences a WINDMILL.  Absurdly, he spins his arms
around and around, daring Foxy to get near him.

She rolls her eyes and waits.  The REF jumps out of the way.
A minute has counted down.  Finally, Andy stops -- and the
real wrestling begins.  Foxy lunges at him and immediately
goes for a choke-hold.  The crowd CHEERS, relieved.  Lawler
motions signals.  Foxy yanks -- but Andy jerks away.

Andy is intrigued.  She's coming to play!  Andy gestures to
the Ref and points UP.  The Ref looks away -- and Andy SLAPS
Foxy.

The crowd furiously JEERS.  The Ref spins around, and Andy
shrugs innocence.  He then runs at Foxy and theatrically
pushes her into the ropes.  She bounces off, stumbles back -
- and Andy drops to his knees.  She trips over him and hits
the mat.

Andy aggressively jumps onto Foxy's shoulders and pins her.
The Ref counts:  One!  Two!  Three!  DING!!

It's over.  But Andy stays on her, shaking his ass, leering
rudely.  Jerry Lawler yells from the corner.

<b>ttLAWLER
</b>tAlright, you won.  GET OFF HER!

Andy remains, flapping his arms like a chicken.

THE BOOING grows.  Louder.  More emotional.

<b>ttANGRY VOICES
</b>tJerry, help her!  Get in there!  Do
tsomething!

Lawler hesitates -- then suddenly climbs in the ring and
lifts Andy off!  Lawler angrily PUSHES Andy down.

Andy is flabbergasted.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tW-what are you DOING?  I don't fight
tmen!

Lawler snickers and walks away.  Completely overreacting,
Andy grabs the mike.

ttANDY (cont'd)
tI'm gonna SUE YOU!
tt(he starts RANTING
ttberserkly)
tLet me tell you something, Lawler!
tI am not a hick -- I'm a national TV
tstar!  And I DON'T like a dumb
tcracker pushing me around in the
tring!  I never agreed to wrestle
tyou!  So you know what I'm gonna
tdo???
tt(seething)
tI'm gonna hire a lawyer to sue you
tfor every cent you've got!  This was
tassault and battery!  In a court of
tlaw, I'm gonna kick your Southern-
tfried rump!!!

Lawler snatches the mike and bellows.

<b>ttLAWLER
</b>tYEAH?!  Well I got news for you,
tAndy Kaufman!  Wrestling is a
tserious sport to me!  I don't like
tanyone makin' fun of it, and I hate
tanyone insultin' the South!  So we
tcan settle this two ways: We can go
tto court... or you can get in the
tring with a man, and wrestle for

</b>
Andy watches, fuming.  He is INFURIATED.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tHe -- can't get away with this.
tt(to Lawler)
tYOU!  You think I'm CHICKEN?!

Andy grabs back the mike.  He sticks his face in shocked
Lawler's.

ttANDY (cont'd)
tt(sarcastic SOUTHERN
<b>ttACCENT)
</b>tYou wanna "wraaastle" me?!  You
twanna "WRAAASTLE" me???  Okay,
tLawler -- let's rumble!  Yeah, I've
tonly wrestled women, but they were
tbigger than you!  In fact, they're
tprobably smarter than you, 'cause
tyou're from "Maaamphis, Taaanassee!"
tt(back to his regular
ttvoice, he points at
tthis head)
tI'm from Hollywood.  I have the
tbrains.  That's how I win.  And Mr.
tLawler, I'm gonna make you cry
t"Mama!"

Andy bears his teeth.  Enraged, Lawler tries to take a swing
at him.  HANDLERS run in and separate the angry men.

<b>EXT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, TUNNEL - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
We hear NOISE from the main event above.  Andy and Lynne
hurry along.  She is disgruntled.  He swaggers arrogantly,
still in his fighting outfit.

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tIs this an act -- or are you
taddicted to causing trouble??

Andy shrugs, lacking a response.  He eats more cake.

tAndy, look... there's a job I want

Andy purses his lips, fretting.  An endless pause.

Uh-oh.  Andy won't finish the line.  The cast looks around

The tension is awful.

Unsure beat -- then fed-up Richards jumps up and storms off

Mary is lost.  She continues giggling, "stoned."

Richards returns... with the CUE CARDS.  Irked, he dumps
them over Andy's head.

The crowd CHEERS stupidly.

<b>INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - SECONDS LATER

And DING!  That's the bell!  Andy strikes a threatening
pose.  Lawler takes a step forward -- and Andy instantly,
cowardly, runs for the ropes and jumps out of the ring.

BOOOOO!!!  Andy grins at the crowd and points at his brain:
I'm smarter.

<b>ttANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>tAnd Kaufman's left the ring!
tLawler's waiting for him to return.

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tt(to Zmuda)
tIs this a strategy?

Lawler disparagingly frowns.  The REF checks his watch.
Andy crosses to the opposite end of the ring, gauging his
rival... then slowly climbs in --

Until the second Lawler moves.  Then Andy leaps back out!

<b>ttANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>tAnd Kaufman's left the ring again!
tHe doesn't seem interested in
tactually making contact with his

Andy struts around the floor, pointing to his brain.  He
smirks at various spectators... until he finds himself face-
to-face with -- his parents.

An unexpected moment.  Andy's finger frozen on his brain.
Janice shakes her head despairingly.

<b>ttJANICE
</b>tAndy, please.  Let's go home!

<b>ttANDY
</b>tDon't worry, Mom.  I'll make you

People HOOT.  Disoriented, Andy returns to the ringside.
Lawler is losing his patience.

<b>ttLAWLER
</b>tHey!  Did you come down here to
twrestle, or to act like an ass?

Andy paces around, unsure of his next move.

ttLAWLER (cont'd)
tLook... if you get in here, I'll
tgive you a free headlock.

Lawler leans down and offers his neck.

Andy peers skeptically.  People JEER.  Andy looks at waiting
Lawler... then tentatively climbs in.

As promised, Lawler doesn't move.  So Andy crosses over and
grabs Lawler's head!  Andy grins triumphantly.  He squeezes
his arms tight, muscles flexing, riding high on this moment.

Until -- Lawler stands and flips him over.  Andy SLAMS DOWN
on his back.  CRUNCH!

<b>ttANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>tIt's a side suplex!!

Andy lies on the mat, unmoving.  Lawler doesn't care.  He

<b>EXT. CARNEGIE HALL - MINUTES LATER
</b>
A thousand people file out -- and THIRTY-FIVE SCHOOLBUSES
are parked up and down Fifth Avenue!!!  The crowd is AWED.

Andy euphorically marches out, pushing his endurance.  He's
the Pied Piper.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tSingle file!  Don't rush!  There's
tenough cookies for everyone!!

<b>EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
The schoolbuses pull up to a school.  The disoriented
passengers step out, not sure what to expect...

<b>INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CAFETERIA - NIGHT
</b>
The audience crowds inside... and LADY CAFETERIA WORKERS in
hairnets are dispensing milk and cookies.  It's remarkable.

At a little kids table sit Andy and Lynne.  Andy's face is
pure joy.  He watches all the adults munching on their
cookies, everyone giddy at the silliness of it all.

Andy smiles beautifully.  He squeezes Lynne's hand, then
whispers.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI don't want this to ever end...

<b>EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAY
</b>
A stucco SPA RESORT sits in the middle of the rocky desert.

<b>INT. SPA - SAME TIME
</b>
A room with soft lighting and billowing curtains.  A New Age
HEALER is laying crystals upon Andy's body.

Andy COUGHS.  His hat is off, revealing he's bald.

<b>ttHEALER
</b>tNow we'll place a blue crystal.
tVery high vibrations.  It's
twonderful for it's healing powers.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tt(spellbound)
tOkay.  Let's try two of those... and
tone of the pink ones.

<b>EXT. SPA - DAY
</b>
Zmuda stands with a swarmy ADMINISTRATOR.

<b>ttADMINISTRATOR
</b>tYour friend is doing four crystal
tsessions a day, but it's just not
thelping.

<b>ttZMUDA
</b>tI know...
tt(beat)
tThe cancer's terminal.

<b>ttADMINISTRATOR
</b>tYes.  That wasn't made particularly
tclear to us when he checked in...

<b>ttZMUDA
</b>tt(irked)
tLook, personally, I think rubbing
trocks on people is a load of
thorseshit.  But if it makes Andy
thappy, that's all that matters.

The man purses his lips.

<b>ttADMINISTRATOR
</b>tI'm sorry to sound crass -- but we
tdon't want to be "that health resort
tin New Mexico where Andy Kaufman
tdied."
tt(beat)
tI'm going to have to ask you to
tleave.

Zmuda is speechless.

<b>INT. SPA, ANDY'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
Zmuda angrily packs Andy's bags.  Zmuda is seething.

But Andy is strangely calm and unaffected.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tIt's okay, Bob.  It wasn't really
tworking.
tt(a gentle smile)
tWe'll find something better.

<b>INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Lynne and Little Wendy are cooking Andy lunch.  Lynne mashes
up strange unidentifiable plant products.

<b>ttLITTLE WENDY
</b>tWhat is this stuff?

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tIt's all macrobiotic.  Millet,
tburdock root, kelp... Andy says
tit'll purify him.

Suddenly -- a SHARP VOICE.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON (O.S.)
</b>tWhat is that crap?  Looks like
tsomethin' my dog would puke up!!

The women turn.  It's Andy -- dressed as Tony Clifton.

A spooked moment.

Tony's wig, peach tux, and sunglasses are there... but Andy
is barely strong enough to bark out the attitude.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tHow 'bout me and you dolls go get
tsome REAL food:  French fries and a
tPorterhouse steak!

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tt(not sure what to
ttsay)
t...Andy...?

Little Wendy's eyes pop:  Oh no she broke the rule!  Tony
gets very indignant.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tI ain't Andy!  I'm Tony!  Andy's
tsick -- pick, chick, kick, lick!
tThe doctor says he's a goner.
tt(rousing himself)
tBut Tony's built like a mule!  Andy
tasked me to be his pallbearer!  I'll
tdo it for him!  I'm getting stronger
tand stronger!  Here, watch this!

Tony picks up a CHAIR and starts lifting it:  Up, down, up,
down.  Worried, the women rush to stop him.  They take the
chair.

<b>ttLYNNE
</b>tStop it!  C'mon, put that down.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tYeah, you're right.  We better get
tmovin'.  We don't wanna miss Happy
tHour at Kelbos -- all the Mai Tai's
tyou can drink for $4.99.

Tony jauntily turns to exit.  He gestures to the ladies.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
tLet's go!
tt(he starts SINGING
tt"New York, New
ttYork")
t"These vagabond blues,
t Are washin' away.
t I'll make a brand new start of

Tony reaches the doorway -- and collapses.

He clutches himself in pain.

<b>ttLYNNE AND LITTLE WENDY
</b>tAndy!!

Shocked, they run over.

Tony lies huddled on the ground.  He mutters sadly,
defeatedly.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tDammit...

<b>ttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DUSK
</b>
The sun is setting, purple and orange over the hills.  Andy
and George lie on chaise lounges, serenely staring out.
Andy has a blank look on his face, and has lost more weight.
He is a shadow of himself.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI can't move my arm.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tt(awkwardly)
tYou've got good days and bad days.

Andy softly sighs.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tMy hair is coming out.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tt(whispers)
tYeah...

George silently pats Andy.  Andy's energy is sapped, but he
forces himself to be upbeat.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tI've got an idea for a new TV show
tfor me to star in.  It's called
t"Uncle Andy's Fun House" -- it'll be
ta Saturday morning thing where I can
tgoof off with the kids.  You know,
tpuppets, magic tricks...

George is choked up.  He goes along with it.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tt(long pause)
tI think we can sell that.

Silence.

George struggles not to shatter Andy's enthusiasm.

Andy smiles gratefully.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tHey... thanks for always backin' me.

George clenches Andy's hand.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tDid your -- doctor say it's okay for
tyou to go back to work?

<b>ttANDY
</b>tEhhh, you know those guys.  If he
thad his way, I'd be stuck in the
thospital, running tests all day.
tt(beat)
tAnd anyway, I've found a new guy
twho's gonna be able to instantly
tremove the cancer.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tt(startled)
tReally?

<b>ttANDY
</b>tYeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the
tPhilippines, and he's amazing!  He
trubs you and sucks the disease right
tout!

Andy beams.  George stares sadly.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tThe Philippines?  I dunno... Andy...
the sounds like one of your
tcharacters.

<b>TIGHT - ANDY
</b>
His voice gets hushed.

<b>ttANDY
</b>tNo... this guy's special.
tt(very sincere)
tHe performs miracles.

George doesn't know how to respond.

Andy looks up pleadingly.

ttANDY (cont'd)
tHe's my last chance.

<b>ttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. BAGUIO CITY, PHILIPPINES - DAY
</b>
Baguio, a tiny scratched-in-the-dirt Philippine city.

Suddenly, a rattletrap COMMUTER PLANE lurches out of the
sky.  It hits a dirt runway.  Dust flies.  Chickens squawk
and run.

<b>INT. BEAT UP TAXI, PHILIPPINES - DAY
</b>
Andy, Lynne, and Zmuda ride through the impoverished city.

Andy stares in amazement.

<b>EXT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY
</b>
They reach a brick building.  A sign says "CLINIC," with an
eye over a triangle.

<b>INT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY
</b>
A NURSE hurriedly helps weakened Andy sign a bunch of forms.
Money is handed over.

Andy's clothes are stripped off.  They're thrown in a
locker.

<b>INT. CLINIC OPERATION ROOM, PHILIPPINES - DAY
</b>
A large white tiled room.  Lynne and Zmuda roll in pallid
Andy, his limp body unmoving.

Andy looks up... and there's a LONG LINE OF SICKLY PEOPLE.
Primarily Japanese, emaciated, all stripped to their
underwear and barely able to stand.

They have a look of desperation and reverence.

At the head of the line is JUN ROXAS at his work station: A
bench, a sink, and ATTENDANTS with clean towels.

A SICKLY WOMAN crawls onto the bench.  Jun impassively
presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach,
kneading, searching.  Pause, then he removes some BLOODY
<b>GUTS.
</b>
He flings them into a bucket.

The woman cries out.

Andy gasps.

The woman is helped away.

Jun turns to wash his hands.  An attendant gives him a towel
to dry with.  Then a SICKLY MAN crawls up...

Andy rolls closer.  He stares at all this with fear.
Nervousness.  Hope.

Jun impassively presses his hand against the man's head.  He
concentrates, searching... then pulls out some BLOODY GUTS.

He flings them into a bucket.

The man shakes.  He is helped away.

Andy is wide-eyed.  He gets closer... closer...

More patients.  More bloody guts.  More sobbing.

Andy's excitement builds.

Then -- he reaches the front.

A moment.

Lynne and Zmuda stare into Andy's eyes, drawn in by his
total belief.  They are overcome.  It feels like they're
saying goodbye.  Lynne gives Andy a tender kiss.  Zmuda
starts to shake his hand -- and instead hugs him tightly.

Andy smiles, then the attendants lift him from the
wheelchair.  They help him up to the bench.

Andy lies down.  Fluorescent lights buzz overhead.

He looks over, and Jun Roxas is washing his hands from the
previous patient.

Andy shivers, anticipating the miracle.

Jun turns.  An attendant gives him a towel to dry off.

Andy relaxes, readying for it all...

He glances at Jun's hands.  Jun hands back the towel -- and
under it the attendant quickly slips Jun a sack of animal
intestines.

Jun discreetly palms it.  He's a fake.

<b>CLOSEUP - ANDY
</b>
A moment of stunned disbelief.

He is shocked.  Outraged.  Disappointed.  Flabbergasted.

The faith is meaningless.  The joke is cosmic.  The con man
has been conned.

Andy's overpowering emotions coalesce... and he starts to
<b>LAUGH.
</b>
It's sidesplittingly funny.  Andy LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, and
LAUGHS, like a crazy man with no salvation, the joy
releasing him, the tears rolling down his cheeks.

His face flushes with color.  Life sparkles in his eyes.
Andy laughs and guffaws until he's hoarse.  This is the best
gag of them all.

<b>tttt SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
</b>
Andy lies in peace in a casket.  He has died.

His expression is pleasantly bland.  Almost Latka-like.  But
his face is caked with so much funeral-home makeup, it
almost looks like a mask.

We slowly widen.  The casket is surrounded by beautiful
flowers.  We TILT UP... and high above... is a MOVIE SCREEN.

On the SCREEN is a projection of Andy, silently staring at
us.  There's a gentle smile on his face.  It's the image
from the opening of this film.

ANDY'S POV: The chapel is filled with GRIEVING MOURNERS.
All are in black.  Everyone's quiet, in a state of shock.

Andy's family is huddled.

Lynne sits alone in a pew, crying.

George gives Zmuda a hug.  Little Wendy comes over... and
they comfort each other.

Everyone who ever knew Andy is there: Taxi cast, Fridays
cast, TM followers, hookers, Jerry Lawler, Ed Weinberger,
Maynard Smith, Budd Friedman, it goes on and on...

And -- they all have odd discombobulated expressions.  They
stare up at the PROJECTED ANDY.

<b>ttANDY (ON FILM)
</b>tWell... My show is over.  I did my
tbest, and I just want to say, until
twe meet again... please remember:
tt(he begins to SING)
t"In this friendly, friendly world...
t With each day so full of joy.
t Why should any heart be lonely."

Some gathered people tentatively join in the SINGING.

ttANDY (ON FILM) (cont'd)
tSo everybody!  Put your arm around
tthe person next to you, even if you
tdon't like that person.  Come on!
tt(he resumes SINGING)
t"The world is such a wonderful
tplace,
tTo wander through,
tWhen you've got someone to love,
tTo wander along with you.
tWith the sky so full of stars,
tAnd the river so full of songs,
tEvery heart should be so thankful,
tThankful for this friendly, friendly
tworld..."

The curtain behind the coffin OPENS and the casket with
Andy's body slowly slides into the DARKNESS.

The curtain closes.  The FILM ENDS.

And all goes silent.

Some people cry.  Some begin to leave.  Most of them are
just staying, numbed.

George and Zmuda whisper.

<b>ttGEORGE
</b>tIt's a perfect Kaufman audience.

<b>ttZMUDA
</b>tYeah.  They don't know whether to be
tsad, or angry.

The Taxi cast are flustered.

</b>tWhy are people leaving?  The
tcurtain's gonna open.  Andy's gonna
tcome out... I know it!

<b>ttTONY DANZA
</b>tSure, the body was just made of

tt(a very long beat)
tWasn't it......?

Silence.  They look to the front.

The closed curtain wafts... then settles motionless.

<b>tttttFADE OUT.

<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. SUNSET BLVD./COMEDY STORE - NIGHT
</b>
A SUPER slowly appears:  "EXACTLY ONE YEAR LATER"

On Sunset, TWO DUDES come riding along on skateboards.
Suddenly they reach -- INSANITY.  Traffic on Sunset is
jammed.  HONKING limousines jockey to squeeze by.

Confused, one Dude squints into the distance -- and his eyes
pop.

<b>ttDUDE #2
</b>tOh my GOD.
tt(stupefied)
tThat's the freakiest thing I've ever
tseen!!  Look!

He points.  His friend turns -- and gasps.

AT THE COMEDY STORE - The marquee says "TONY CLIFTON: LIVE!"

<b>ttDUDE #1
</b>tMan, we were right!  He's not dead!

<b>ttDUDE #2
</b>tHe's just been lyin' low for a year!
<b>tWE GOTTA GO!

Hysterical, the guys race up to the club.  But outside,
there's a CRAZED, PULSING MOB.  People are screaming.
Police have barricades.  Everybody cries to get in.

<b>INT. COMEDY STORE - SAME TIME
</b>
It's packed.  Every square inch is filled with glittery
Hollywood VIPs.  People make chit-chat... but there is a
squeamish excitement in the air.  A brooding unease.  Nobody
knows what to expect.

Suddenly -- the lights go black.  A BOOMING ANNOUNCER.

<b>ttANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>tLadies and Gentlemen!  Please put
tyour hands together for... Tony
tClifton!

The THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.  "DAAAAA, DAAAAA,
<b>DAAAAA!  DA-DAAAAA"!
</b>
A small SPOT appears -- on a peach tuxedo.  The light grows
bigger, bigger... the tension magnifying... people
gasping... our view widening... until Tony Clifton is
revealed onstage!

It's an extraordinary theatrical moment -- without response.
The crowd has no idea what to do.

Tony smirks.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tHow ya doin'?

Dead silence.

Tony struts downstage.  He waves to the crowd.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
tHow you doin' back there?!
tt(to the front rows)
tHow you doin' up here?!

Still no response.  Until -- a lone reckless VOICE.

<b>ttVOICE
</b>tAndy!

Whoa.  The crowd rustles nervously.

Tony grimaces.

<b>ttTONY CLIFTON
</b>tDon't know nothin' about no Andy.
tJust some dead guy tryin' to ride my

tt(to the BAND)
tLet's HIT IT, boys!  One, two, anda

The BAND kicks in with disco anthem "I WILL SURVIVE."  Tony
starts SINGING the schmaltzy opening:

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
t"First I was afraid
t I was petrified.
t Kept thinkin' I could never live
t Without you at my side."
tt(he wipes away a
ttpretend tear)
t"Were you the one that tried to
t Hurt me with goodbye?
t Did you think I'd crumble?
t Did you think I'd lay down and
t Die...?"

We PAN the room full of enthralled spectators.  At a front
table are George and Lynne.

Tony attacks the chorus.

ttTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
t"Oh no not I!
<b>t I WILL SURVIVE!
</b>t As long as I know how to love,
t I know I'll simply stay alive!"

In the crowd, we pass face after face -- smiling...
frowning... intrigued... confused... until we settle on a
man in the very last row.

Bob Zmuda.

Enjoying the show more than anyone.
