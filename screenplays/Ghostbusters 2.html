<b>EXT.  MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY
</b>
A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty
prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the
Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.

<b>EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DAY
</b>
A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is
having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.
DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full
bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The

building superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to
notice.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (exasperated)
tttFrank, do you think you could give me a hand
tttwith these bags?

<b>ttttttFRANK
</b>tttI'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a
tttbuilding superintendent.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttYou're also a human being, Frank.

<b>ttttttFRANK
</b>tttt (reluctantly going to help)
tttOkay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the
ttthell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the
tttgrocery bags from her.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (setting the wheel brakes on
tttt the buggy)
tttThank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this
ttteventually.

She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and
makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.

<b>ttttttFRANK
</b>tttt (to the baby)
tttHiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?

<b>ttttttFRANK
</b>tttt (to Dana)
tttThat's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.
tttBarrett.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (finding her keys)
tttThank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to
tttfix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you
tttlast week.

<b>ttttttFRANK
</b>tttDidn't I do it?

<b>BABY BUGGY
</b>
It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.

<b>EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY
</b>
He GURGLES with delight at the movement.

<b>EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY
</b>
Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttNo, you didn't, Frank.

<b>ttttttFRANK
</b>tttOkay, that's no problem.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttThat's exactly what you said last week.

<b>BUGGY WHEELS
</b>
The brakes unlock themselves.

<b>DANA
</b>
She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward
just out of her reach and stops.  Surprised by the movement, she reaches
for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even
further.  Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps
rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.

<b>SIDEWALK
</b>
Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians
for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy
swerves and continues unchecked.

<b>INTERSECTION
</b>
Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races
toward the corner.

<b>DANA
</b>
She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.

<b>EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY
</b>
A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.

<b>BUGGY
</b>
It careens toward the corner.

<b>EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY
</b>
Its eyes are wide open with excitement.

<b>EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY
</b>
Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and
into the crosswalk.

<b>BUS
</b>
The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the
intersection at high speed.

<b>BUGGY
</b>
It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street.  The bus
continues missing the buggy by inches.

<b>INTERSECTION
</b>
Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the
intersection and snatches up the baby.  She hugs it close, deeply
relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the
supernatural has re-entered her life.

<b>tttttttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY
</b>
THEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar "No Ghosts" symbol
and PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the
Ghostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the
Upper West Side.  RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding
shotgun.

<b>EXT.  WEST 77TH STREET - DAY  (MOMENTS LATER)
</b>
The Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.
Stantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump
out of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the
house.

<b>INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
</b>
A WOMAN greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished
house.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (all business)
tttHow many of them are there, ma'am?

<b>ttttttWOMAN
</b>tttFourteen.  They're in the back.  I hope you can
ttthandle them.  It's been like a nightmare.

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttHow big are they?

She holds her hand out indicating about four feet.

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttt (resolute)
tttWe'll do our best, ma'am.

<b>ttttttWOMAN
</b>tttThey're right out here.

She leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room.
Stantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttReady?

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttI'm ready.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttThen let's do it.

He pushes through the French doors and they step into the room.

<b>INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
</b>
They are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming KIDS
between the ages of seven and ten.

<b>ttttttKIDS
</b>tttt (disappointed)
tttGhostbusters!!  Boooo!!

Tables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the
room is strewn with discarded toys and games.  A couple of weary parents
sink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party.

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttt (trying his best)
tttHow you doin', kids?

<b>ttttttLITTLE BOY
</b>tttt (nasty)
tttI though we were having He-Man.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttHe-Man couldn't make it today.  That's why
tttwe're here.

<b>ttttttBOY
</b>tttMy dad says you're full of crap.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (stopped cold)
tttWell, a lot of people have trouble believing
tttin the paranormal.

<b>ttttttBOY
</b>tttNo, he just says you're full of crap and that's
tttwhy you went out of business.

He kicks Stantz in the leg.  Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (low and menacing)
tttI'm watching you.
tttt (to Winston)
tttSong.

Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the
Ghostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing

<b>ttttttSTANTZ AND WINSTON
</b>ttt'There's something wrong in the neighborhood.
tttWho you gonna call?'

<b>ttttttKIDS
</b>tttt (all together)
tttHe-Man!!

<b>tttttttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)
</b>
Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttThat's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties.
tttI'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged
tttnine-year-olds.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttCome on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The
tttholidays are coming up.  It's our best season.

They get in the car

<b>INT.  ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
</b>
Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttGive it up, Ray.  You're living in the past.
tttGhostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year
tttthese kids won't even remember who we are.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (tries to start the car again)
tttUngrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we
tttdid for this city.

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttYeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job
tttwe had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow
tttman and blew the top three floors off an uptown
ttthighrise.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttYeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a
ttthamburger without chopping up a cow.

He turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and
CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits
of metal onto the pavement.  Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty
exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies.  Frustrated, Stantz
bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel

<b>INT.  WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)
</b>
A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,
Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title
card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and
we return to the show in progress: "World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter
Venkman."  There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and
sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat
infamous ex-Ghostbuster.

<b>VENKMAN
</b>
He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,
understated and intimate.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttHi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'
tttI'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,
tttauthor, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton
tttAnglund.
tttt (to his guest)
tttMilt, your new book is called The End of the
tttWorld.  Isn't that kind of like writing about
tttgum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you
tttthink anybody wants to read a book about it?

<b>ttttttMILTON
</b>tttWell, I think it's important for people to know
tttthat the world is in danger.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttOkay, so can you tell us when it's going to
ttthappen or do we have to buy the book?

<b>ttttttMILTON
</b>tttI predict that the world will end at the
tttstroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttThis year?  That's cutting it a little close,
tttisn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of
tttview, the book just came out, right?  So you're
tttnot even looking at the paperback release for
tttmaybe a year.  And it's going to be at least
tttanother year after that if the thing has
tttmovie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.
tttYou would have been better off predicting 1992
tttor even '94 just to be safe.

<b>ttttttMILTON
</b>tttt (irritated)
tttThis is not just some money-making scheme!  I
tttdidn't just make up the date.  I have a strong
tttpsychic belief that the world will end on New
tttYear's Eve.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (placating)
tttWell, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But
tttI think my other guest may disagree with you.
tttElaine, you had another date in mind?

The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey
housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.

<b>ttttttELAINE
</b>tttAccording to my sources, the world will end
ttton February 14, in the year 2016.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttValentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer.
tttWhere did you get that date, Elaine?

<b>ttttttELAINE
</b>tttI received this information from an alien.  I
tttwas at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having
ttta drink in the bar when he approached me and
tttstarted talking.  Then he must have used some
tttsort of ray or a mind control device because
ttthe made me follow him to his room and that's
tttwhere he told me about the end of the world.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttYour alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?

<b>ttttttELAINE
</b>tttIt may have been a room on the spacecraft made
tttup to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I
tttcan't be sure, Peter.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (humoring her)
tttNo, you can't, and I think that's the whole
tttproblem with aliens; you just can't trust them.
tttYou may get some nice ones occasionally like
tttStarman or E.T., but most of them turn out to
tttbe some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just
tttabout out of time.
tttt (does his wrap-up right TO
tttt the CAMERA)
tttNext week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless
tttpets.
tttt (holds up a hairless cat)
tttUntil then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...
tttt (puts a finger to his temple
tttt and sends out a though to his
tttt viewers)
ttt... Good night.

<b>INT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)
</b>
Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a
well-meaning young incompetent.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttWhere do you find these people?  I thought
tttwe were having the telekinetic guy who bends
tttthe spoons?

<b>ttttttNORMAN
</b>tttA lot of the better psychics won't come on the
tttshow.  They think you're too skeptical.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttSkeptical!  Norman, I'm a pushover.  I think
tttprofessional wrestling is real.

There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come
out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (to Norman)
tttWhat's all this?

<b>ttttttNORMAN
</b>tttThey just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttThe Mayor!  He's a friend of mine.

Venkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK
HARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (calling to the Mayor)
tttLenny!

The Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know
him.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (starts to follow him)
tttLenny!  It's Pete Venkman!

The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand
against Venkman's chest.

<b>ttttttHARDEMEYER
</b>tttt (snide)
tttCan I help you?

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (dangerous)
tttYeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.

<b>ttttttHARDEMEYER
</b>tttI'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant.
tttWhat can I do for you?

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttI'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just
tttwant to say hello to him.

<b>ttttttHARDEMEYER
</b>tttt (scornful)
tttI know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting
tttany ghosts lately?

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttNo, that's what I want to talk to the mayor
tttabout.  We did a little job for the city a
tttwhile back and we ended up getting sued,
tttscrewed and tattooed by deskworms like you.

<b>ttttttHARDEMEYER
</b>tttt (bristling)
tttLook, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall,
tttbarring a disaster, he's going to be elected
tttgovernor of this state and the last thing we
tttneed is for him to be associated with two-bit
tttfrauds and publicity hounds like you and your
tttfriends.  You read me?

Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttOkay, I get it.  But I want you to tell Lenny
tttthat, because of you, I'm not voting for him.

<b>EXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY
</b>
The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and
visitors.  Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and
enters the museum.

<b>INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)
</b>
We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO
THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an
incredibly powerful evil presence.  Then we PULL BACK to reveal the
studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit
by large skylights in the ceiling.  Working on the Vigo painting is
JANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the
department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy.  Janosz is staring
longingly across the room at Dana.

<b>DANA
</b>
She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still
preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy.  Janosz
watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her
shoulder.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttt (with an East European accent)
tttStill working on the Turner?

Dana jumps, startled by the intrusion.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttOh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,
tttJanosz.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttYou know, you are really doing very good work
ttthere.  I think soon you may be ready to assist
tttme in some of the more important restorations.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttThank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here,
tttbut now that my baby's a little older, I was
ttthoping to rejoin the orchestra.

<b>VIGO PAINTING
</b>
At the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his
head and looks at Dana.

<b>JANOSZ AND DANA
</b>
Neither of them notice the movement in the painting.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttt (disappointed)
tttWe'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I
tttcould take you to lunch today?

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttActually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have
tttan appointment.
tttt (looks at her watch)
tttIn fact, I'd better go.

She starts gathering up her things.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttEvery day I ask you, and every day you've got
tttsomething else to do.  Do I have bad breath
tttor something?

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (trying to brush him off)
tttI'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttOkay, I'll take a raincheck on that.

Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttt (to himself)
tttI think she likes me.

He switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the
phrases as he resumes working.

<b>EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY
</b>
Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building.  A sign
identifies it as "The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research."

<b>INT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)
</b>
Dana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly
intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an
experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom
are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean.  The device he is testing is a black
box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic
displays.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>ttt... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped
tttdead in the middle of the street

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>
tttDid anyone else see this happen?

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttHundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't
tttimagine this.

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttI'm not saying you did.  In science we always
tttlook for the simplest explanation.

An ASSISTANT interrupts.

<b>ttttttASSISTANT
</b>tttWe're ready, Dr. Spengler

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttt (to the Assistant)
tttWe'll start with the negative calibration.

He picks up the device and prepares to test it.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (curious)
tttWhat are you working on, Egon?

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttI'm trying to determine whether human
tttemotional states have a measurable effect on
tttthe psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a
ttttheory Ray and I were working on when we had
tttto dissolve Ghostbusters.

An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually
a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room.  Inside the
waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated
arguement.

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttt (to Dana)
tttThey think they're here for marriage
tttcounseling.  We've kept them waiting for two
ttthours and we've been gradually increasing the
ttttemperature in the room.
tttt (checking a heat sensor)
tttIt's up to 95 degrees at the moment.  Now my
tttassistant is going to enter and ask them if
tttthey'd mind waiting another half-hour.

As Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the
waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay.  They explode
with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them
through the glass.  After recording his readings, he returns to his
Assistant.

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttWe'll do the happiness index next.
tttt (to Dana)
tttI'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if
tttit's all right with you.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttOkay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttOh no.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (affectedly casual)
tttDo you ever see him?

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttOccasionally

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttHow is he these days?

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttVenkman?  I think he was borderline for a
tttwhile there.  Then he crossed the border.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttDoes he ever mention me?

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttNo.  Not that I can recall.

They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely
little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (slightly disappointed)
tttWell, we didn't part on very good terms and
tttwe sort of lost track of each other when I
tttgot married.

The Assistant interrupts again.

<b>ttttttASSISTANT
</b>tttWe're ready for the affection test.

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttt (to the assistant)
tttGood.  Send in the puppy.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (continuing)
tttI thought of calling him after my marriage
tttended, but --.  Anyway, I appreciate you're
tttdoing this, Egon

They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable
Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl.  Spengler monitors
her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (handing him a card)
tttThis is my address and telephone number.
tttWill you call me?

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttCertainly.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttEgon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of
tttthis to Peter if you don't mind.

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttI won't.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttThank you.

She shakes his hand and exits.

<b>EXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)
</b>
It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in
Greenwich Village.  The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old
books full of arcane metaphysical lore.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.

<b>INT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS

The shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.
Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan
sweater over a T-shirt.  He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews
on a battered, reeking pipe.  As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup
of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ

</b>tttSome crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come

his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking
him.

Dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.

</b>tttOkay, let's take a look.

Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely
oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning
like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill.  Then he signals
for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.

Unnoticed by Janosz, the eyes of Vigo start to glow.

He touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red,
crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body,

The figure of Vigo comes to life, turns toward Janosz and gestures

lit by strong work lights.

<b>POLICE CAR
</b>
It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift
worksite and stops.  The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler
doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.
Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.

rubbing his sore shoulders.

</b>tttYou were supposed to help me with this.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttYou need the exercise.

Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the
rubble from the hole.  Suddenly he hits metal.  They clear away
generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ

tttNYPRR.  What the hell -- ?  Help me lift

Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray.

tttGee, this really is deep.

Suddenly, his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft
and swings free in some kind of tunnel.

tttHold it!  Steady!

He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into

tttHold it!!  Stop!!  Whoa!!

<b>INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - FLOOR - NIGHT

Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable
torrent of disgusting ooze.

As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely
amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in
the bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING
through ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC,
and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain

He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he
can.  He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on
it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.
Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting
the pole.

<b>SLIME
</b>
Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of
the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet.  He jerks his legs up
as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.

for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.
She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door
and looks in.  Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.
Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz

He goes back to the defense table and sits down.  Stantz and Spengler
hang their heads.  Venkman pats Louis on the back.

tttWay to go.  Concise and to the point.

He stares at Louis, astonished at his summation.

He searches through a disorderly pile of notes.

</b>tttAnd on a more personal note, let me go on
tttrecord as saying that there is no place in

He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily.  Then
he feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom.

The slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar.

Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases.  All eyes turn to the
exhibit table.  Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as TWO FULL-TORSO
APPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar.

<b>JUDGE
</b>
He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and
recognizes them immediately.

<b>ttttttJUDGE
</b>tttt (in horror)
tttOh, my God!  The Scoleri Brothers!

<b>SCOLERI BROTHERS
</b>
Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten
feet tall.  They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are
metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still
attached.  Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their
bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to
get at the Judge.

<b>JUDGE
</b>
Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense
table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the
spectral intruders.

<b>ttttttJUDGE
</b>tttt (terrified)
tttYou've got to do something!

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttWho are they?

<b>ttttttJUDGE
</b>tttThey're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them
tttfor murder.  They were electrocuted up at
tttOssining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttMaybe they just want to appeal.

<b>SCOLERI BROTHERS
</b>
They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense
table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.

<b>PROSECUTOR
</b>
She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.

<b>GHOSTBUSTERS
</b>
They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge
with them.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttThese boys aren't playing around.

<b>ttttttJUDGE
</b>tttt (desperately)
tttYou've got to stop them.  Please!

<b>ttttttLOUIS
</b>tttt (thinking like a lawyer)
tttViolating a judicial restraining order could
tttexpose my clients to serious criminal
tttpenalties.  As their attorney I'd have to
tttadvise them against it.

<b>SCOLERI BROTHERS
</b>
They start punching through the jury box.

</b>
He is just about hysterical with fear.

<b>ttttttJUDGE
</b>tttAll right!  All right!  I'm recinding the
tttorder.  Case dismissed!!
tttt (he pounds his gavel on
tttt the floor)
tttNow do something!

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttLet's go to work, boys.

With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash
across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were
being displayed as evidence.  They strap them on hastily as the Brothers
continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (slinging the pack onto
tttt his back)
tttGeez, I forgot how heavy these things are.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (grabbing other gear)
tttOkay, let's heat 'em up!

They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle
throwers.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttAll right, throwers.  Set for full neutronas
ttton stream.

They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.

<b>SCOLERI BROTHERS
</b>
They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts
them.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttHey!  Why don't you pick on someone your own
tttsize?

The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot
lightning at their new adversaries.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (to the others)
tttOn my signal, boys.  Open 'em up -- Now!

They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible
powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttSpengs, take the door.  Ray, let's try and
tttwork them down and into the corner.

Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the
streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on
the floor.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttWatch it!  I'm coming under you, Pete.

They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while
ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers.  Finally, Ray
sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of
light energy.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttSteady -- watch your streams -- easy now --
tttVenky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him
tttdown -- trapping -- trapping -- now!

He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the
traps which snap shut.

He crawls out from under a chair.  Reporters and spectators get back on

The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground,
dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted
into place over the main entrance.  It's just like the original "No

up two fingers.  Venkman enters the firehouse.

actually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom.  Janine
sees it and screams.

along the track that circles the reservoir.  One of the runners looks
behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams.

<b>GHOSTLY JOGGER

A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace.  Other runners
stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them.  Seemingly
oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to
his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse.

On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which

They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttt (smiling at Venkman)
tttDana, aren't you going to introduce me to
tttyour friend?

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttOh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman.
tttPeter, Janosz Poha.

Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up.

</b>tttt (avoiding his gaze)
tttPleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on
ttttelevision.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttHow are you?
tttt (looking over at the Vigo
tttt painting)
tttWhat's that you're working on, Johnny?

Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go.  Venkman and Dana cross to
the Vigo painting.  Janosz steps protectively in front of it.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttIt's a painting I'm restoring for the new
tttByzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait
tttof Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled
tttmost of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th
tttCentury.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (staring at the painting)
tttToo bad for the Moldavians.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttt (defensive)

tttHe was a very powerful magician.  A genius
tttin many ways and quite a skilled painter.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttHe was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.
tttI hate this painting.  I've felt very
tttuncomfortable since they brought it up from
tttstorage.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttYeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want
tttto hang in the rec room.  You know what it
tttneeds?
tttt (picking up a brush)
tttA fluffy little white kitten in the corner.

Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttt (with forced good will)
tttWe don't go around altering valuable
tttpaintings, Dr. Venkman.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttWell, I'd make an exception in this case if
tttI were you.

Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (to Janosz)
tttI'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting
tttyou.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttMy pleasure.

Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (confidentially)
tttI may be wrong, but I think you've got a
tttlittle crush on this guy.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttGood-bye, Peter.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (dragging his feet)
tttI'd like to stay, but I really don't have
ttttime to hang around here.  I'll call you.
tttt (calls out to Janosz)
tttLater, Johnny!

He exits.

<b>VIGO
</b>
Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench.

<b>DANA
</b>
She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab
area.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttOh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have
tttsomething really amazing to show you.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (to Spengler)
tttIt's not that thing you do with your
tttnostrils, is it?

Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among
the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a
Tupperware container.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (to Venkman)
tttWe've been studying the stuff that we took
tttfrom the subway tunnel.

He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttAnd now you're going to eat it?

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttNo, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a
large Petri dish.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttNow watch this.

He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (simulating anger)
tttYou worthless piece of slime!!
tttt (as the slime starts to
tttt twitch and glow)
tttYou ignorant disgusting blob!!

<b>SPECIMEN
</b>
It bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttYou foul, obnoxious muck!!

<b>STANTZ
</b>
He continues venting his rage on the slime.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttI've seen some real crud in my time, but
tttyou're a chemical disgrace!!

The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the
Petri dish.

<b>STANTZ AND SPENGLER
</b>
They turn to Venkman for his reaction.  He's dumbfounded.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttThis is what you do with your spare time?

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (very excited)
tttThis is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman.
tttA psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>ttt'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff
tttand sell it.

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttWe've found it at every event site we've
tttbeen to lately.

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttt (poking at the slime)
tttYou mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttLike a goat on garbage.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttWe're running tests to see if we can get an

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttWhat kind of tests?

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (a little embarrassed)
tttWell, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say
tttsupportive, nurturing things --

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttYou're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?

Spengler reacts as if he might be.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttIt really responds to music.
tttt (to Spengler)
tttLet's calm it down.

Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing "Cumbaya" to
the slime specimen.

<b>SPECIMEN
</b>
It stops bubbling and starts to shrink.

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttDoes it have any favorites?

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttIt likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,'
ttt'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small
tttWorld' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the
psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttWatch this.

Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's "HIGHER AND HIGHER"
BLASTS from the speakers.

<b>TOASTER
</b>
It shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC.

<b>VENKMAN
</b>
He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of
toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttI don't care what you say.  This could be a
tttmajor Christmas gift item.

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttRight, and the first time someone gets mad,
ttttheir toaster will eat their hand.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttSo we'll put a warning on the label.

Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving.  Venkman looks
at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (to the toaster)
tttGo ahead.  I dare you.

Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand
and won't let go.  The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and
easily withdraws his hand.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttJust kidding.

<b>tttttttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet.  She's
wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby.  She
turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water
temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (talking sweetly to the
tttt baby)
tttLook at you.  I think we got more food on
tttyour shirt than we got in your mouth.

<b>BATHTUB
</b>
The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the
bottom of the tub.  Dana reaches over and turns off the water without
looking into the tub.  When she turns away, both taps start to spin by
themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.

<b>DANA
</b>
Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath
into the tub.

<b>BATHTUB
</b>
The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the
bubble bath.

<b>DANA
</b>She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.
She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to
close up around the baby like a hugh mouth.  Dana screams, snatches the
baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the
bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.

<b>tttttttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER)
</b>
The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old
magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment.  Venkman is asleep on the
floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed
just short of the bedroom.  The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to
his feet and answers it.  He opens the door and sees Dana standing there.
She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked,
wrapped in a baby blanket.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (somewhat embarrassed to
tttt be there)
tttI'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (surprised to see her)
tttNo, I just got in -- a couple hours ago.
tttCome on in.
tttt (noting her apparel)
tttAre we having a pajama party?

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (upset)
tttPeter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

Venkman looks at her for a long moment.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttYou know, if anyone else told me that, I'd
ttthave serious doubts.  But coming from you,
tttI can't honestly say I'm surprised.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttI must be losing my mind.  At the museum
ttttoday I could have sworn that terrible
tttpainting of Vigo looked right at me.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttWho could blame him?  Were you wearing this
tttnightgown?

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttt (distraught)
tttI don't know what to do anymore.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttI'll get Ray and Egon to check out the
tttbathtub.  You better stay here.

He exits to the bathroom.  She looks around the loft, amazed at the
disorder.  Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and
takes Oscar from her.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttNow this kid has a serious nudity problem.

He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts
tying it around him like a diaper.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (to the baby)
tttThis is Joe Namath's old number, you know.
tttYou could get a lot of chicks with this.
tttJust don't pee in it.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttPeter, what about the bathtub?

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (grabs the phone and dials)
tttWe'll take care of that.
tttt (on the phone)
tttRay, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right
tttaway ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one --
ttttried to eat the kid.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttIt was full of this awful pink ooze.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (to Ray)
tttSounds like another slime job ... No,

tttRight ... Let me know.

He hangs up.

</b>tttThey're going over there right now.  You
tttmight as well make yourself at home.  Let
tttme show you around.
tttt (he crosses to the kitchen area)
tttThis is the cuisine de maison --

It's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the
counters are littered with all sorts of food trash.  He grabs a big open
Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttt (looking at the sink)
tttWe may have to wash some of these if you get
ttthungry --
tttt (he looks in the fridge)
ttt-- but there's no food anyway so forget
tttabout it.  I have all kinds of carry-out

He opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then
crosses to the bathroom.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttBathroom's right here -- let me just tidy
tttup a few things.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttPeter, this is very nice, but you don't have
tttto do any of this, you know.

He goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING
and more items going into the Hefty bag.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN (O.S.)
</b>tttThe shower works but it's a little tricky.
tttThey're both marked "Hot."  It takes a little
tttpractice, but at least this one won't try
tttand eat you.

He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his
shoulder.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttBe careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.
tttBut the bed's good and I just changed the
tttsheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In
tttfact, I think you should definitely plan on
tttspending the night here.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttReally?  And how would we handle the sleeping
tttarrangements?

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttFor me it's best if I sleep on my side and
tttyou spoon up right behind me with your arms
tttaround me.  If we go the other way I'm
tttafraid your hair will be getting in my face
tttall night.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttHow about you on the sofa and me in bed with
tttthe baby.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttOr we could do that.

<b>ttttttDANA
</b>tttThank you.
tttt (she picks up Oscar)
tttPoor baby.  I think I should put him down
tttnow.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttI'll put him down for you.
tttt (taking the baby)
tttYou are way too short!  And your belly-button
tttsticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to
tttyour poor mother!

Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living
room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.

Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and
Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttDid you find anything at Dana's?

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttNothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in
tttand around the bathtub.  But we did turn up
tttsome interesting stuff on this Vigo character
tttyou mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the
tttCarpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,
tttMartyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttt (reads from xerox of entry)
ttt"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttA hundred and five years?  He really hung
ttton, didn't he.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttAnd he didn't die of old age either.  He was
tttpoisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,
tttdisemboweled, drawn and quartered.

<b>ttttttWINSTON
</b>tttI guess he wasn't too popular at the end
tttthere.

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttNo, not exactly a man of the people.
tttt (reads)
ttt"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the
tttTorturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the
tttUnholy."

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttThis guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in
tttall the Black Arts, and listen to this
tttprophecy.  Just before his head died, his
tttlast words were, "Death is but a door, time
tttis but a window.  I'll be back."

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttThat's it?  "I'll be back?"

<b>ttttttSPENGLER
</b>tttIt's a rough translation from the Moldavian.

They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.

</b>tttWe're just going up to Restorations for a

ttt-- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock
tttfrom a planar rift, I suggest you get down

Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters
head upstairs.

<b>INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

</b>tttI know.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttThen why have you come?

tttLet's sweep it, boys.

They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttWe'll know when we find it.  You just sit
ttttight.  This won't take long.

<b>STANTZ
</b>
Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to
the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio.  Venkman
comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.

<b>ttttttVENKMAN
</b>tttThis is the one that looked at Dana.

<b>ttttttJANOSZ
</b>tttIt must be the chemical fumes in the studio.
tttPeople start imagining things --

tttt (to Vigo)
tttHey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking
tttto you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking

They watch the painting for any sign of movement.

</b>
His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.

tttBeautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby.

tttOkay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish

</b>tttI'll get one more reading.

Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting.  Stantz scans
the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.

<b>VIGO
</b>
His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.

<b>STANTZ
</b>
He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle
transformation occurs within him.  Winston comes up behind him and breaks
the spell.

the transparent vinyl curtain.  He closes the bathroom door and looks at
the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling
off.  Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the
bathroom wrapped in a towel.  She jumps back into the bathroom.

They cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.

Stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of

He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and

Spengler reads the depth.

Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the
platform and around his boots.

<b>ttttttSTANTZ
</b>tttt (alarmed)
tttLet's get out of here, boys.

He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.

Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger
than all three of them.  As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and
closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his
belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt.  Spengler lets go in time
but Winston doesn't.  He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow.
Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in
after him.

Frantic now, Dana rushes to the window and looks out, as Louis and Janine
come running in.

The baby is standing out on the ledge at the corner of the building,
fifty feet above the street, staring off into the distance as if he's
waiting for something.

Dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby.
Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes.

They lean out the window, gaping at the apparition.

<b>EXT.  VENKMAN'S LEDGE - APPARITION
</b>
A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling
on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground.  Her face looks
remarkably like Janosz Poha's.  The nanny extends her hand to the BABY
who GURGLES sweetly as he reaches out to take it.

<b>DANA
</b>
She watches in helpless horror.

<b>ttttttDANA

She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and
smiles at Dana.  The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny
shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.

A taxi pulls up, Dana jumps out and rushes into the museum.  The moment
the door closes behind her, there is a loud THUNDERCLAP, the ground
trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of
the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the
building.

Moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in
eerie white light.  Oscar is lying safely on a table in front of the
painting of Vigo.  Dana enters cautiously and sees the baby.  Seeing no
one else about, she quickly sneaks down to the table and picks up the
baby, hugging hin tight, greatly relieved to find him unharmed and
intact.

Dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly Oscar flies out of her arms,
floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle.

courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs.

She yelps in pain.

The doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat
comes alive.  MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and
YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air.  Reacting quickly, the
doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and
starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror.
The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street.

The building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho-reactive slime.
CITY WORKMEN and FIREMEN are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches,
jackhammers, power tools and the "jaws of life," but they can't even make
a dent.

a dark shadow falls across the skylight.  Janosz looks up.

Janosz retreats from the shower of broken glass as the Ghostbusters come
sliding down ropes into the studio and confront Janosz with their new

tttOh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.

With that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from
head to toe, blowing him into the corner.  Then they turn to Vigo.

<b>VIGO
</b>
He is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the
knees down.  He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash
his magic powers.

They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been

They pull him to his feet.

He hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well.  Venkman recoils
in disgust.

tttTake care of the wiggler, will you.

Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby.  She hugs Venkman.

It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four
archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby.  One holds a harp,
one, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword.  Most
remarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to Venkman, Stantz,
Spengler and Winston.
