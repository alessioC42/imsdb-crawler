                                        Screenplay

                                            By

                                  Ethan Coen & Joel Coen


<b>ttttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tON BARTON FINK
</b>
tHe is a bespectacled man in his thirties, hale but somewhat 
tbookish. He stands, tuxedoed, in the wings of a theater, 
tlooking out at the stage, listening intently to end of a 
tperformance.

tIn the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a 
tflat, expressionlessly smoking a cigarette, one hand on a 
tthick rope that hangs from the ceiling.

tThe voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen 
tstage:

<b>ttttACTOR
</b>ttI'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for 
ttgood.  I'm kissin' it all goodbye, 
ttthese four stinkin' walls, the six 
ttflights up, the el that roars by at 
ttthree A.M. like a castiron wind. 
ttKiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury!  
ttI'll miss 'em x96 like hell I will!

<b>ttttACTRESS
</b>ttDreaming again!

<b>ttttACTOR
</b>ttNot this time, Lil! I'm awake now, 
ttawake for the first time in years. 
ttUncle Dave said it: Daylight is a 
ttdream if you've lived with your eyes 
ttclosed. Well my eyes are open now! I 
ttsee that choir, and I know they're 
ttdressed in rags! But we're part of 
ttthat choir, both of us x96 yeah, and 
ttyou, Maury, and Uncle Dave too!

<b>ttttMAURY
</b>ttThe sun's coming up, kid. They'll be 
tthawking the fish down on Fulton 
ttStreet.

<b>ttttACTOR
</b>ttLet 'em hawk. Let 'em sing their 
tthearts out.

<b>ttttMAURY
</b>ttThat's it, kid. Take that ruined 
ttchoir.  Make it sing!

<b>ttttACTOR
</b>ttSo long, Maury.

<b>ttttMAURY
</b>ttSo long.

tWe hear a door open and close, then approaching footsteps. A 
ttall, dark actor in a used tweed suit and carrying a beat-up 
tvalise passes in front of Barton: From offscreen stage:

<b>ttttMAURY
</b>ttWe'll hear from that kid. And I don't 
ttmean a postcard.

tThe actor sets the valise down and then stands waiting int 
the shadows behind Barton.

tAn older man in work clothes x96 not wardrobe x96 passes in front 
tof Barton from the other direction, pauses at the edge of 
tthe stage and cups his hands to his mouth.

<b>ttttOLDER MAN
</b><b>ttFISH! FRESH FISH!
</b>
tAs the man walks back off the screen:

<b>ttttLILY
</b>ttLet's spit on our hands and get to 
ttwork.  It's late, Maury.

<b>ttttMAURY
</b>ttNot any more Lil...

tBarton mouths the last line in sync with the offscreen actor:

<b>ttttMAURY
</b>tt...It's early.

tWith this the stagehand behind Barton furiously pulls the 
trope hand-over-hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts 
tof "Bravo!"  

tAs the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down, somewhat 
tmuting the applause, the backstage actor trots out of frame 
ttoward the stage.

tThe stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope, bringing the curtain 
tback up and unmuting the applause.

tBarton Fink seems dazed. He has been joined by two other 
tmen, both dressed in tuxedos, both beaming toward the stage.

<b>tBARTON'S POV
</b>
tLooking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as 
tthe curtain rises on the enthusiastic house. The actors take 
ttheir bows and the cry of "Author, Author" goes up from the 
tcrowd.

tThe actors turn to smile at Barton in the wings.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHe hesitates, unable to take it all in.

tHe is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed 
tgentlemen.

tAs he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening.

<b>tTRACKING SHOT
</b>
tPushing a maitre 'd who looks back over his shoulder as he 
tleads the way through the restaurant.

<b>ttttMAITRE 'D
</b>ttYour table is ready, Monsieur Fink...  
ttseveral members of your party have 
ttalready arrived...

<b>tREVERSE
</b>
tPulling Barton

<b>ttttFINK
</b>ttIs Garland Stanford here?

<b>ttttMAITRE 'D
</b>ttHe called to say he'd be a few minutes 
ttlate... Ah, here we are...

<b>tTRACKING IN
</b>
tToward a large semi-circular booth. Three guests, two me and 
ta woman in evening wear, are rising and beaming at Barton. A 
tfat middle-aged man, one of the tuxedoed gentlemen we saw 
tbackstage, is moving out to let Barton slide in.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttBarton, Barton, so glad you could 
ttmake it.  You know Richard St. 
ttClaire...

tBarton nods and looks at the woman.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>tt...and Poppy Carnahan. We're drinking 
ttchampagne, dear boy, in honor of the 
ttoccasion. Have you seen the Herald?

tBarton looks sullenly at his champagne glass as the fat man 
tfills it.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNot yet.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttWell, I don't want to embarrass you 
ttbut Caven could hardly contain 
tthimself. But more important, Richard 
ttand Poppy here loved the play.

<b>ttttPOPPY
</b>ttLoved it! What power!

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttYeah, it was a corker.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThanks, Richard, but I know for a 
ttfact the only fish you've ever seen 
ttwere tacked to a the wall of the 
ttyacht club.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttOuch!

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttBravo! Nevertheless, we were all 
ttdevastated.

<b>ttttPOPPY
</b>ttWeeping! Copius tears! What did the 
ttHerald say?

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttI happen to have it with me.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttPlease Derek x96

<b>ttttPOPPY
</b>ttDo read it, do!

<b>ttttDEREK
</b>tt"Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the 
ttCommon Man. The star of the Bare 
ttRuined Choirs was not seen on the 
ttstage of the Belasco last night x96 
ttthough the thespians involved all 
ttacquitted themselves admirably. The 
ttfind of the evening was the author 
ttof this drama about simple folk x96 
ttfish mongers, in fact x96 whose brute 
ttstruggle for existence cannot quite 
ttquell their longing for something 
tthigher. The playwright finds nobility 
ttin the most squalid corners and poetry 
ttin the most callused speech. A tough 
ttnew voice in the American theater 
tthas arrived, and the owner of that 
ttvoice is named... Barton Fink."

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThey'll be wrapping fish in it in 
ttthe morning so I guess it's not a 
tttotal waste.

<b>ttttPOPPY
</b>ttCynic!

<b>ttttDEREK
</b>ttWell we can enjoy your success, 
ttBarton, even if you can't.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttDon't get me wrong x96 I'm glad it'll 
ttdo well for you, Derek.

<b>ttttDEREK
</b>ttDon't worry about me, dear boy x96 I 
ttwant you to celebrate.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttAll right, but I can't start listening 
ttto the critics, and I can't kid myself 
ttabout my own work. A writer writes 
ttfrom his gut, and his gut tells him 
ttwhat's good and what's... merely 
ttadequate.

<b>ttttPOPPY
</b>ttWell I don't pretend to be a critic, 
ttbut Lord, I have a gut, and it tells 
ttme it was simply marvelous.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttAnd a charming gut it is.

<b>ttttPOPPY
</b>ttYou dog!

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttt(baying)
ttAaa-woooooooo!

tBarton turns to look for the source of an insistent jingling. 
tWe swish pan off him to find a busboy marching through the 
trestaurant displaying a page sign, bell attached, with 
tBarton's name on it.

<b>tTRACKING IN TOWARD A BAR
</b>
tA distinguished fifty-year-old gentleman in evening clothes 
tis nursing a martini, watching Barton approach.

<b>tPULLING BARTON
</b>
tAs he draws near.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI thought you were going to join us.  
ttJesus, Garland, you left me alone 
ttwith those people.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttDon't panic, I'll join you in a 
ttminute.  What's you think of Richard 
ttand Poppy?

tBarton scowls

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThe play was marvelous. She wept, 
ttcopiously. Millions of dollars and 
ttno sense.

tGarland smiles, then draws Barton close.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttWe have to talk a little business. 
ttI've just been on the phone to Los 
ttAngeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures 
ttwants to put you under contract. 
ttThey've offered you a thousand dollars 
tta week. I think I can get them to go 
ttas high as two.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttTo do what?

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttWhat do you do far a living?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm not sure anymore. I guess I try 
ttto make a difference.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttFair enough. No pressure here, Barton, 
ttbecause I respect you, but let me 
ttpoint out a couple of things. One, 
tthere you make a difference to five 
tthundred fifty people a night x96 if 
ttthe show sells out.  Eighty five 
ttmillion people go to the pictures 
ttevery week.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttTo see pap.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttYes, generally, to see pap. However, 
ttpoint number two: A brief tenure in 
ttHollywood could support you through 
ttthe writing of any number of plays.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI don't know, Garland; my place is 
tthere right now. I feel I'm on the 
ttbrink of success-

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttI'd say you're already enjoying some.

tBarton leans earnestly forward.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo, Garland, don't you see? Not the 
ttkind of success where the critics 
ttfawn over you or the producers like 
ttDerek make a lot of money. No, a 
ttreal success x96 the success we've 
ttbeen dreaming about x96 the creation 
ttof a new, living theater of, about, 
ttand for the common man! If I ran off 
ttto Hollywood now I'd be making money, 
ttgoing to parties, meeting the big 
ttshots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself 
ttoff from the wellspring of that 
ttsuccess, from the common man.

tHe leans back and chuckles ruefully.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...I guess I'm sprouting off again. 
ttBut I am certain of this, Garland: 
ttI'm capable of more good work. Maybe 
ttbetter work than I did in Choirs. It 
ttjust doesn't seem to me that Los 
ttAngeles is the place to lead the 
ttlife of mind.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttOkay Barton, you're the artist, I'm 
ttjust the ten percenter. You decide 
ttwhat you want and I'll make it happen. 
ttI'm only asking that your decision 
ttbe informed by a little realism x96 if 
ttI can use that word and Hollywood in 
ttthe same breath.

tBarton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the 
tfloor.

tGarland studies him.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>tt...Look, they love you, kid x96 
tteverybody does. You see Caven's review 
ttin the Herald?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo, what did it say?

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttTake my copy. You're the toast of 
ttBroadway and you have the opportunity 
ttto redeem that for a little cash x96 
ttstrike that, a lot of cash.

tGarland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>tt...The common man'll still be here 
ttwhen you get back. What the hell, 
ttthey might even have one or two of 
tt'em out in Hollywood.

tAbsently:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...That's a rationalization, Garland.

tGarland smiles gently.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttBarton, it was a joke.

tWe hear a distant rumble. It builds slowly and we cut to:

<b>tA GREAT WAVE
</b>
tCrushing against the Pacific shore.

tThe roar of the surf slips away as we dissolve to:

<b>tHOTEL LOBBY
</b>
tA high wide shot from the front door, looking down across 
twilting potted palms, brass cuspidors turning green, ratty 
twing chairs; the fading decor is deco-gone-to-seed.

tAmber light, afternoon turning to evening, slopes in from 
tbehind us, washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights.  

tBarton Fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops 
tin the middle foreground to look across the lobby.

tWe are framed on his back, his coat and hat. The lobby is 
tempty.  There is a suspended beat as Barton takes it in.  

tBarton moves toward the front desk.

<b>tTHE REVERSE
</b>
tAs Barton stops at the empty desk. He hits a small silver 
tbell next to the register. Its ring-out goes on and on without 
tlosing volume.

tAfter a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs.  
tBarton, puzzled, looks around the empty lobby, then down at 
tthe floor behind the front desk.

<b>tA TRAP DOOR
</b>
tIt swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform, 
tholding a shoebrush and a shoe x96 not one of his own x96 climbs 
tup from the basement.

tHe closes the trap door, steps up to the desk and sticks his 
tfinger out to touch the small silver bell, finally muting 
tit.

tThe lobby is now silent again.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttWelcome to the Hotel Earle. May I 
tthelp you, sir?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm checking in. Barton Fink.

tThe clerk flips through cards on the desk.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttF-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be 
ttyou, huh?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttMust be.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttOkay then, everything seems to be in 
ttorder. Everything seems to be in 
ttorder.

tHe is turning to a register around for Barton to sign.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>tt...Are you a tranz or a rez?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttTransient or resident?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI don't know... I mean, I'll be here, 
ttuh, indefinitely.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttRez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a 
ttweek payable in advance. Checkout 
tttime is twelve sharp, only you can 
ttforget that on account you're a rez.  
ttIf you need anything, anything at 
ttall, you dial zero on your personal 
ttin-room telephone and talk to me. My 
ttname is Chet.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell, I'm going to be working here, 
ttmostly at night; I'm a writer. Do 
ttyou have room service?

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttKitchen closes at eight but I'm the 
ttnight clerk. I can always ring out 
ttfor sandwiches.

tThe clerk is scribbling something on the back of an index 
tcard.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>tt...Though we provide privacy for the 
ttresidential guest, we are also a 
ttfull service hotel including 
ttcomplimentary shoe shine. My name is 
ttChet.

tHe pushes a room key across the counter on top of the index 
tcard.

tBarton looks at the card.

tOn it: "CHET!" Barton looks back up at the clerk. They regard 
teach other for a beat.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>tt...Okay

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHuh?

tThe clerk.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttOkey-dokey, go ahead.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWhat x96

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttDon't you wanna go to your room?!

tBarton stares at him.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...What number is it?

tThe clerk stares back.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>tt...Six-oh-five. I forgot to tell 
ttyou.

tAs Barton stoops to pick up his two small bags:

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>tt...Those your only bags?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThe others are being sent.

tThe clerk leans over the desk to call after him:

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttI'll keep an eye out for them. I'll 
ttkeep my eyes peeled, Mr. Fink.

tBarton is walking to the elevator.

<b>tELEVATOR
</b>
tBarton enters and sets down his bags.

tAn aged man with white stubble, wearing a greasy maroon 
tuniform, sits on a stool facing the call panel. He does not 
tacknowledge Barton's presence.

tAfter a beat:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Six, please.

tThe elevator man gets slowly to his feet. As he pushes the 
tdoor closed:

<b>ttttELEVATOR MAN
</b>ttNext stop: Six.

<b>tSIXTH-FLOOR HALLWAY
</b>
tBarton walks slowly toward us, examining the numbers on the 
tdoors.

tThe long, straight hallway is carpeted with an old stained 
tforest green carpet. The wallpaper shows faded yellowing 
tpalm trees.  Barton sticks his key in the lock of a door 
tmidway down the hall.

<b>tHIS ROOM
</b>
tAs Barton enters.

tThe room is small and cheaply furnished. There is a lumpy 
tbed with a worn yellow coverlet, an old secretary table, and 
ta wooden luggage stand.

tAs Barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and 
twash basin, a house telephone on a rickety night stand, and 
ta window with yellowing sheers looking on an air shaft.  

tBarton throws his valise onto the bed where it sinks, 
tjittering.  He shrugs off his jacket.

tPips of sweat stand out on Barton's brow. The room is hot.  

tHe walks across the room, switches on an oscillating fan and 
tstruggles to throw open the window. After he strains at it 
tfor a moment, it slides open with a great wrenching sound.  

tBarton picks up his Underwood and places it on the secretary 
ttable. He gives the machine a casually affectionate pat.  

tNext to the typewriter are a few sheets of house stationary: 
<b>t"THE HOTEL EARLE: A DAY OR A LIFETIME."
</b>
tWe pan up to a picture in a cheap wooden frame on the wall 
tabove the desk. A bathing beauty sits on the beach under a 
tcobalt blue sky. One hand shields her eyes from the sun as 
tshe looks out at a crashing surf.

tThe sound of the surf mixes up.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tLooking at the picture

<b>tTRACKING IN ON THE PICTURE
</b>
tThe surf mixes up louder. We hear a gull cry.

tThe sound snaps off with the ring of a telephone.

<b>tTHE HOUSE PHONE
</b>
tOn the nightstand next to the bed. With a groan of bedsprings 
tBarton sits into frame and picks up the telephone.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHow d'ya like your room!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Who is this?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttChet!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Who?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttChet! From downstairs!

tBarton wearily rubs the bridge of his nose.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tt...How d'ya like your room!

<b>tA PILLOW
</b>
tAs Barton's head drops down into frame against it.

tHe reaches over and turns off the bedside light.

tHe lies back and closes his eyes.

tA long beat.

tWe hear a faint hum, growing louder.

tBarton opens his eyes.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tA naked, peeling ceiling.  The hum x96 a mosquito, perhaps x96 
tstops.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHis eyes move this way and that. After a silent beat, he 
tshuts them again.

tAfter another silent beat, we hear x96 muffled, probably from 
tam adjacent room x96 a brief, dying laugh. It is sighing and 
tweary, like the end of a laughing fit, almost a sob.

tSilence again.

tWe hear the rising mosquito hum.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b>tEXECUTIVE OFFICE
</b>
tBarton Fink is ushered into a large, light office by an 
tobsequious middle- aged man in a sagging suit.

tThere are mosquito bites on Barton's face.

<b>tREVERSE
</b>
tFrom behind a huge white desk, a burly man in an expensive 
tsuit gets to his feet and strides across the room.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttIs that him?! Barton Fink?!  Lemme 
ttput my arms around this guy!

tHe bear-hugs Barton.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>tt...How the hell are ya? Good trip?

tHe separates without waiting for an answer.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttMy name is Jack Lipnik. I run this 
ttdump. You know that x96 you read the 
ttpapers.

tLipnik is lumbering back to his desk.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttLou treating you all right? Got 
tteverything you need?  What the hell's 
ttthe matter with your face? What the 
tthell's the matter with his face, 
ttLou?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttIt's not as bad as it looks; just a 
ttmosquito in my room x96

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttPlace okay?

tTo Lou:

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt...Where did we put him?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm at the Earle.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttNever heard of it. Let's move him to 
ttthe Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, 
tthe can stay at my place.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThanks, but I wanted a place that 
ttwas less...

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttLess Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's 
ttnot a dirty word. Sat whatever the 
tthell you want. The writer is king 
tthere at Capitol Pictures. You don't 
ttbelieve me, take a look at your 
ttpaycheck at the end of every week x96 
ttthat's what we think of the writer.
ttt(to Lou)
tt...so what kind of pictures does he 
ttlike?

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttMr. Fink hasn't given a preference, 
ttMr.  Lipnik.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttHow's about it, Bart?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttTo be honest, I don't go to the 
ttpictures much, Mr. Lipnik x96

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttThat's okay, that's okay, that's 
ttokay x96 that's just fine. You probably 
ttjust walked in here thinking that 
ttwas going to be a handicap, thinking 
ttwe wanted people who knew something 
ttabout the medium, maybe even thinking 
ttthere was all kind of technical mumbo-
ttjumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. 
ttWe're only interested in one thing: 
ttCan you tell a story, Bart?  Can you 
ttmake us laugh, can you make us cry, 
ttcan you make us wanna break out in 
ttjoyous song? Is that more than one 
ttthing? Okay.  The point is, I run 
ttthis dump and I don't know the 
tttechnical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run 
ttit? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit.  
ttShowmanship. And also, and I hope 
ttLou told you this, I bigger and meaner 
ttthan any other kike in this town. 
ttDid you tell him that, Lou? And I 
ttdon't mean my dick's bigger than 
ttyours, it's not a sexual thing x96 
ttalthough, you're the writer, you 
ttwould know more about that. Coffee?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Yes, thank you.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttLou.

tLou immediately rises and leaves. Lipnik's tone becomes 
tconfidential:

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt...He used to have shares in the 
ttcompany.  An ownership interest. Got 
ttbought out in the twenties x96 muscled 
ttout according to some. Hell, according 
ttto me. So we keep him around, he's 
ttgot a family. Poor schmuck. He's 
ttsensitive, don't mention the old 
ttdays. Oh hell, say whatever you want.  
ttLook, barring a preference, Bart, 
ttwe're gonna put you to work on a 
ttwrestling picture. Wallace Beery. I 
ttsay this because they tell me you 
ttknow the poetry of the street. That 
ttwould rule out westerns, pirate 
ttpictures, screwball, Bible, Roman...

tHe rises and starts pacing.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttBut look, I'm not one of these guys 
ttthinks poetic has gotta be fruity.  
ttWe're together on that, aren't we? I 
ttmean I'm from New York myself x96 well, 
ttMinsk if you wanna go way back, which 
ttwe won't if you don't mind and I 
ttain't askin'. Now people're gonna 
tttell you, wrestling. Wallace Beery, 
ttit's a B picture. You tell them, 
ttbullshit. We don't make B pictures 
tthere at Capitol.  Let's put a stop 
ttto that rumor right now.

tLou enters with coffee.

</b>tt...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. 
ttTalking about the Wallace Beery 
ttpicture.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttExcellent picture.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttWe got a treatment on it yet?

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttNo, not yet Jack. We just bought the 
ttstory. Saturday Evening Post.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttOkay, the hell with the story. Wallace 
ttBeery is a wrestler. I wanna know 
tthis hopes, his dreams. Naturally, 
tthe'll have to get mixed up with a 
ttbad element. And a romantic interest. 
ttYou know the drill.  Romantic 
ttinterest, or else a young kid. An 
ttorphan. What do you think, Lou?  
ttWally a little too old for a romantic 
ttinterest?  Look at me, a writer in 
ttthe room and I'm askin' Lou what the 
ttgoddamn story should be!

tAfter a robust laugh, he beams at Barton.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? 
ttDame?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Both maybe?

tThere is a disappointed silence. Lipnik looks at Lou.  Lou 
tclears his throat.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>tt...Maybe we should do a treatment.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttAh, hell, let Bart take a crack at 
ttit.  He'll get into the swing of 
ttthings or I don't know writers. Let's 
ttmake it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. 
ttWe don't gotta tackle the world our 
ttfirst time out. The important thing 
ttis we all have that Barton Fink 
ttfeeling, but since you're Barton 
ttFink I'm assuming you have it in 
ttspades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. 
ttWe're off to a good start. Dammit, 
ttif all our writers were like you I 
ttwouldn't have to get so goddamn 
ttinvolved. I'd like to see something 
ttby the end of the week.

tLou is getting to his feet and signaling for Barton to do 
tlikewise.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt...Heard about your show, by the 
ttway. My man in New York saw it. Tells 
ttme it was pretty damn powerful. Pretty 
ttdamn moving.  A little fruity, he 
ttsaid, but I guess you know what you're 
ttdoing. Thank you for your heart. We 
ttneed more heart in pictures.  We're 
ttall expecting great things.

<b>tTRACKING SHOT
</b>
tWe are in the sixth-floor hallway of the Earle, late at night. 
tA pair of shoes sits before each door. Faintly, from one of 
tthe rooms, we can hear the clack. clack. clack. of a 
ttypewriter.

tIt grows louder as we track forward.

<b>tEXTREME CLOSE SHOT x96 TYPEWRITER
</b>
tClose on the typing so that we see only each letter as it is 
ttyped, without context.

tOne by one the letters clack on: a-u-d-i-b-l-e. After a short 
tbeat, a period strikes.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tElbows on his desk, he looks down at what he has just written. 
tHe rolls the paper up a few lines, looks some more.

<b>tTHE PAGE
</b>
tIt says:

<b>ttttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tA TENEMENT BUILDING
</b>
tOn Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is 
taudible.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tAfter a beat he rolls the sheet back into place.

<b>tEXTREME CLOSE SHOT
</b>
tThe letter-strike area. It is lined up to the last period, 
twhich is struck over by a comma. The words "as is" are typed 
tin and we cut back to x96

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tx96 as he continues typing. He stops after several more 
tcharacters and looks.

tSilence.

tBreaking the silence, muffled laughter from an adjacent room. 
tA man's laughter. It is weary, solitary, mirthless.

tBarton looks up at the wall directly in front of him.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe picture of the girl on the beach.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tStaring, as the end-of-the-tether laughing continues. Barton 
tlooks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work, but 
tthe sound is too insistent to ignore.

<b>tWIDE SHOT
</b>
tThe room, Barton sitting at his desk, staring at the wall.  

tThe laughter.

tBarton pushes his chair back, goes to the door, opens it and 
tlooks out.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. At the 
tend of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the 
tstaircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of 
twall sconces.

tThe laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the 
tempty hall.

tPerhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because 
tit is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for 
tweeping.

tBarton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. He slowly 
twithdraws into his room.

<b>tHIS ROOM
</b>
tBarton looks down at his typewriter for a beat. The 
tlaughter/weeping continues.

tHe walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house 
tphone.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHello... Chet? This is Barton Fink 
ttin room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's 
ttsomeone in the room next door to 
ttmine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh... 
ttmaking a lot of... noise.

tAfter a beat:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Thank you.

tHe cradles the phone. The laughter continues for a moment or 
ttwo, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the 
ttelephone ringing next door.

tBarton looks at the wall.

tThe muffled sound of a man talking.

tThe sound of the earpiece being pronged.

tMuffled footsteps next door.

tThe sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting.  

tFootsteps approaching the hall.

tA hard, present knock at Barton's door.

tBarton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door.

<b>tON THE DOOR
</b>
tAs Barton opens it. Standing in the hall is a large man x96 a 
tvery large man x96 in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened 
ttie. His face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of 
tsweat.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttDid you... Somebody just complained...

tHastily:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo, I didn't x96 I mean, I did call 
ttdown, not to complain exactly, I was 
ttjust concerned that you might x96 not 
ttthat it's my business, but that you 
ttmight be in some kind of... distress. 
ttYou see, I was trying to work, and 
ttit's, well, it was difficult x96

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttYeah. I'm damn sorry, if I bothered 
ttyou.  The damn walls here, well, I 
ttjust apologize like hell...

tHe sticks his hand out.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>tt...My name's Charlie Meadows. I guess 
ttwe're neighbors...

tWithout reaching for the hand.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttBarton Fink.

tUnfazed, Charlie Meadows unpockets a flask.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNeighbor, I'd feel better about the 
ttdamned inconvenience if you'd let me 
ttbuy you a drink.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThat's all right, really, thank you.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAll right, hell, you trying to work 
ttand me carrying on in there. Look, 
ttthe liquor's good, wuddya say?

tAs he enters:

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt... You got a glass? It's the least 
ttI can do.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttOkay... a quick one, sure...

tHe gets two glasses from the wash basin.  Charlie sits down 
ton the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, 
ttall the carryings-on next door.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThat's okay, I assure you. It's just 
ttthat I was trying to work x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat kind of work do you do, Barton, 
ttif you don't mind my asking?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell, I'm a writer, actually.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou don't say. That's a tough racket. 
ttMy hat's off to anyone who can make 
tta go of it. Damned interesting work, 
ttI'd imagine.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttCan be. Not easy, but x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDamned difficult, I'd imagine.

tAs he hands Charlie a glass:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttAnd what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, 
ttyou might say I sell peace of mind. 
ttInsurance is my game x96 door-to-door, 
tthuman contact, still the only way to 
ttmove merchandise.

tHe fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty 
tglass.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...In spite of what you might think 
ttfrom tonight, I'm pretty good at it.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttDoesn't surprise me at all.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHell yes. Because I believe in it. 
ttFire, theft, and casualty are not 
ttthings that only happen to other 
ttpeople x96 that's what I tell 'em. 
ttWriting doesn't work out, you might 
ttwant to look into it. Providing for 
ttbasic human need x96 a fella could do 
ttworse.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThanks, I'll keep it in mind.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat kind of scribbler are you x96 
ttnewspaperman did you say?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo, I'm actually writing for the 
ttpictures now x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttPictures! Jesus!

tHe guffaws.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...I'm sorry, brother, I was just 
ttsitting here thinking I was talking 
ttto some ambitious youngster, eager 
ttto make good.  Hell, you've got it 
ttmade! Writing for pictures! Beating 
ttout that competition!  And me being 
ttpatronizing!

tHe gestures toward his face:

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Is the egg showing or what?!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThat's okay; actually I am just 
ttstarting out in the movies x96 though 
ttI was pretty well established in New 
ttYork, some renown there,

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOh, it's an exciting time then. I'm 
ttnot the best-read mug on the planet, 
ttso I guess it's no surprise I didn't 
ttrecognize your name. Jesus, I feel 
ttlike a heel.

tFor the first time Barton smiles.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThat's okay, Charlie. I'm a 
ttplaywright. My shows've only played 
ttNew York. Last one got a hell of a 
ttwrite-up in the Herald. I guess that's 
ttwhy they wanted me here.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHell, why not? Everyone wants quality.  
ttWhat kind of venue, that is to say, 
ttthematically, uh...

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWhat do I write about?

tCharlie laughs.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCaught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, 
ttthat's it, Bart.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell, that's a good question. Strange 
ttas it may seem, Charlie, I guess I 
ttwrite about people like you. The 
ttaverage working stiff. The common 
ttman.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell ain't that a kick in the head!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah, I guess it is. But in a way, 
ttthat's exactly the point. There's a 
ttfew people in New York x96 hopefully 
ttour numbers are growing x96 who feel 
ttwe have an opportunity now to forge 
ttsomething real out of everyday 
ttexperience, create a theater for the 
ttmasses that's based on a few simple 
tttruths x96 not on some shopworn 
ttabstractions about drama that doesn't 
tthold true today, if they ever did...

tHe gazes at Charlie.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...I don't guess this means much to 
ttyou.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHell, I could tell you some storiesx96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttAnd that's the point, that we all 
tthave stories. The hopes and dreams 
ttof the common man are as noble as 
ttthose of any king. It's the stuff of 
ttlife x96 why shouldn't it be the stuff 
ttof theater?  Goddamnit, why should 
ttthat be a hard pill to swallow? Don't 
ttcall it new theater, Charlie; call 
ttit real theater. Call it our theater.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI can see you feel pretty strongly 
ttabout it.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell, I don't mean to get up on my 
tthigh horse, but why shouldn't we 
ttlook at ourselves up there?  Who 
ttcares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop 
ttand Lady Higginbottom and x96 and x96 
ttand who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI can feel my butt getting sore 
ttalready.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttExactly, Charlie! You understand 
ttwhat I'm saying x96 a lot more than 
ttsome of these literary types. Because 
ttyou're a real man!

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAnd I could tell you some stories x96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttSure you could!  And yet many writers 
ttdo everything in their power to 
ttinsulate themselves from the common 
ttman x96 from where they live, from 
ttwhere they trade, from where they 
ttfight and love and converse and x96 
ttand x96 and... so naturally their work 
ttsuffers, and regresses into empty 
ttformalism and x96 well, I'm spouting 
ttoff again, but to put it in your 
ttlanguage, the theater becomes as 
ttphony as a three dollar bill.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah, I guess that's tragedy right 
ttthere.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttFrequently played, seldom remarked.

tCharlie laughs.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhatever that means.

tBarton smiles with him.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYou're all right, Charlie. I'm glad 
ttyou stopped by. I'm sorry if x96 well 
ttI know I sometimes run on.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, 
ttI'll let you know if I'm bored. I 
ttfind it all pretty damned interesting. 
ttI'm the kind schmoe who's generally 
ttinterested in the other guy's point 
ttof view.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell, we've got something in common 
ttthen.

tCharlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell Christ, if there's any way I 
ttcan contribute, or help, or whateverx96

tBarton chuckles and extends his hand.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttSure, sure Charlie, you can help by 
ttjust being yourself.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, I can tell you some stories x96

tHe pumps Barton's hand, then turns and pauses in the doorway.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...And look, I'm sorry as hell about 
ttthe interruption. Too much revelry 
ttlate at night, you forget there are 
ttother people in the world.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttSee you, Charlie.

tCharlie closes the door and is gone.

tBarton goes back to his desk and sits.

tMuffled, we can hear the door of the adjacent room opening 
tand closing.

tBarton looks at the wall.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe bathing beauty.

tFrom offscreen we hear a sticky, adhesive-giving-way sound.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHe looks around to the opposite x96 
ttbed x96 wall.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe wallpaper is lightly sheened with moisture from the heat.  

tOne swath of wallpaper is just finishing sagging away from 
tthe wall. About three feet of the wall, where it meets the 
tceiling, is exposed.

tThe strip of wallpaper, its glue apparently melted, sags and 
tnods above the bed. It glistens yellow, like a fleshy tropical 
tflower.

<b>tBACK TO BARTON
</b>
tHe goes over to the bed and steps up onto it. He smooths the 
twallpaper back up against the wall.

tHe looks at his hand.

<b>tHIS HAND
</b>
tSticky with tacky yellow wall sweat.

tHe wipes it onto his shirt.

tWe hear a faint mosquito hum.

tBarton looks around.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT
</b>
tA TYPEWRITER Whirring at high speed. The keys strike too 
tquickly for us to make out the words.

<b>tSLOW TRACK IN
</b>
tOn Barton, sitting on a couch in an office anteroom, staring 
tblankly.  Distant phones ring. Barton's eyes are tired and 
tbloodshot.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tA gargoyle secretary sits typing a document.

tThe office door opens in the background and a short middle-
taged man in a dark suit emerges.

tTo his secretary:

<b>ttttEXECUTIVE
</b>ttI'm eating on the lot today x96

tHe notices Barton.

<b>ttttEXECUTIVE
</b>tt...Who's he?

tThe secretary looks over from her typing to consult a slip 
tof paper on her desk.

<b>ttttSECRETARY
</b>ttBarton Fink, Mr. Geisler.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttMore please.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum 
ttsaid I should drop by morning to see 
ttyou about the x96

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttEver act?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Huh? No, I'm x96

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttWe need Indians for a Norman Steele 
ttwestern.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm a writer. Ted O x96

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttThink about it, Fink. Writers come 
ttand go; we always need Indians.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're 
ttproducing this Wallace Beery picture 
ttI'm working on.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttWhat!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. 
ttThey've assigned me enough pictures 
ttfor a goddamn year. What Ted Okum 
ttdoesn't know you could almost squeeze 
ttinto the Hollywood Bowl.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThen who should I talk to?

tGeisler gives a hostile stare. Without looking at her, he 
taddresses the secretary:

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttGet me Lou Breeze.

tHe perches on the edge of the desk, an open hand out toward 
tthe secretary, as he glares wordlessly at Barton.

tAfter a moment:

<b>ttttSECRETARY
</b>ttIs he in for Mr. Geisler?

tShe puts the phone in Geisler's hand.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttLou? How's Lipnik's ass smell this 
ttmorning?... Yeah?... Yeah?... Okay, 
ttthe reason I'm calling, I got a writer 
tthere, Fink, all screwy. Says I'm 
ttproducing that Wallace Beery wrestling 
ttpicture x96 what'm I, the goddamn 
ttjanitor around here?...  Yeah, well 
ttwho'd you get that from?...  Yeah, 
ttwell tell Lipnik he can kiss my 
ttdimpled ass... Shit! No, alright... 
ttNo, no, all right.

tWithout looking he reaches the phone back. The secretary 
ttakes it and cradles it.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>tt...Okay kid, let's chow.

<b>tCOMMISSARY
</b>
tBarton and Geisler sit eating in a semicircular booth. Geisler 
tspeaks through a mouthful of food:

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttDon't worry about it. It's just a B 
ttpicture. I bring it in on budget, 
ttthey'll book it without even screening 
ttit. Life is too short.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttBut Lipnik said he wanted to look at 
ttthe script, see something by the end 
ttof the week.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttSure he did. And he forgot about it 
ttbefore your ass left his sofa.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttOkay. I'm just having trouble getting 
ttstarted. It's funny, I'm blocked up.  
ttI feel like I need some kind of 
ttindication of... what's expected x96

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttWallace Beery. Wrestling picture. 
ttWhat do you need, a road map?

tGeisler chews on his cottage cheese and stares at Barton.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>tt...Look, you're confused? You need 
ttguidance? Talk to another writer.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWho?

tGeisler rises and throws his napkin onto his plate.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttJesus, throw a rock in here, you'll 
tthit one. And do me a favor, Fink: 
ttThrow it hard.

<b>tCOMMISSARY MEN'S ROOM
</b>
tBarton stands at a urinal.

tHe stares at the wall in front of him as he pees. After a 
tmoment, he cocks his head, listening.

tWe hear a throat clearing, as if by a tenor preparing for a 
tdifficult passage. It is followed by the gurgling ruch of 
tvomit.

tBarton buttons his pants and turns to face the stalls.

tThere is more businesslike throat clearing.

tBarton stoops.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tWe boom down to show the blue serge pants and well-polished 
tshoes of the stall's kneeling occupant.

tA white handkerchief has been spread on the floor to protect 
tthe trouser knees.

tThe toilet flushes. The man rises, picks up his handkerchief 
tup off the floor and gives it a smart flap.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHe quickly straightens and goes to the sink. He starts washing 
this hands. We hear the stall door being unlatched.

tBarton glances over his shoulder.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe stall door opening.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tQuickly, self-consciously, he looks back down at his hands.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tHis hands writhing under the running water. We hear footsteps 
tapproaching.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tForcing himself to look at his hands. We hear the man reach 
tthe adjacent sink and turn on the tap.

tBarton can't help glancing up.

<b>tTHE MAN
</b>
tA dapper little man in a neat blue serge suit. He has warm 
tbrown eyes, a patrician nose, and a salt-and-pepper mustache. 
tHe smiles pleasantly at Barton.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHe gives a nervous smile x96 more like a tic x96 and looks back 
tdown at his hands. We hear the man gargling water and spitting 
tinto the sink.

tAfter a moment, Barton looks up again.

<b>tTHE MAN
</b>
tReacting to barton's look as he washes his hands. This time, 
ta curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tLooks back down, then up again.

<b>tTHE MAN
</b>
tExtends a dripping hand.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttBill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor.

tHis speech is softly accented, from the South.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttBarton Fink.

tThey shake, then return to their ablutions.

tWe hold on Barton as we hear Mayhew's faucet being turned 
toff and his foot-steps receding. For some reason, Barton's 
teyes are widening.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Jesus. W.P.!

tThe dapper little man stops and turns.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttI beg your pardon?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttW.P. Mayhew? The writer?

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttJust Bill, please.

tBarton stands with his back to the sink, facing the little 
tman, his hands dripping onto the floor. There is a short 
tpause. Barton is strangely agitated, his voice halting but 
turgent.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttBill!...

tMayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile. Finally 
tBarton brings out:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...You're the finest novelist of our

tMayhew leans against a stall.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttWhy thank you, son, how kind. Bein' 
ttoccupied here in the worship of

ttto see your play x96

tHe smiles at Barton's surprise.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>tt...Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the 
ttnews reaches us in Hollywood.

tHe is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttSir, I'm flattered that you even 
ttrecognize my name. My God, I had no 
ttidea you were in Hollywood.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttAll of us undomesticated writers 
tteventually make their way out here 
ttto the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's 
ttwhy I allus have such a powerful

tHe clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves 
tit at Barton.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>tt...A little social lubricant, Mistuh 
ttFink?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttIt's still a little early for me.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttSo be it.

tHe knocks back some more.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Bill, if I'm imposing you should

tMayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his throat.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>tt...You are drippin', suh.

tBarton looks down at his hands, then pulls a rough brown 
tpaper towel from a dispenser.

tMayhew sighs:

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>tt...Mistuh Fink, they have not invented 
tta genre of picture that Bill Mayhew 
tthas not, at one time or othuh, been 
ttinvited to essay. I have taken my 
ttstabs at the wrastlin' form, as I 
tthave stabbed at so many others, and 
ttwith as little success. I gather 
ttthat you are a fresh-man here, eager 
ttfor an upperclassman's council.  
ttHowever, just at the moment...

tHe waves his flask.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>tt...I have drinkin' to do. Why don't 
ttyou stop at my bungalow, which is 
ttnumbah fifteen, later on this 
ttafternoon...

tHe turns to leave.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>tt...and we will discuss wrastlin' 
ttscenarios and other things lit'rary.

<b>tTHE NUMBER "15"
</b>
tWe are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door.  

tMuted, from inside, we hear Mayhew's voice x96 enraged, 
tbellowing.  We hear things breaking. Softer, we hear a woman's 
tvoice, its tone placating.

<b>tREVERSE TRACKING SLOWLY IN
</b>
tOn Barton, standing in front of the door.

tThe noise abates for a moment. We hear the woman's voice 
tagain.

tBarton hesitates, listening; he thinks, decides, knocks.  

tWith this the woman's voice stops, and Mayhew starts wailing 
tagain.

tThe door cracks open.

tThe woman looks as if she has been crying.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>tt...Can I help you?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm sorry, I... My name is Fink... 
ttUh, Bill asked me to drop by this 
ttafternoon.  Is he in?

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttMr. Mayhew is indisposed at the 
ttmomentx96

tFrom inside, we hear Mayhew's wail.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b><b>ttHONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!
</b>
tThe woman glances uncomfortably over her shoulder and steps 
toutside, closing the door behind her.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttMr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor, Mr. 
ttMayhew's personal secretary. I know 
ttthis all must sound horrid. I really 
ttdo apologize...

tThrough the door Mayhew is still wailing piteously.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttIs, uh... Is he okay?

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttHe will be... When he can't write, 
tthe drinks.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b><b>ttWHERE ARE YOU, DAMMIT! WHERE'S 
</b><b>ttM'HONEY!!
</b>
tShe brushes a wisp of hair out of her eyes.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttI am sorry, it's so embarassing.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHow about you? Will you be alright?

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttI'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr 
ttFink?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYes I am. I'm working on a wres x96 
ttplease call me Barton.

tAudrey reaches out and touches Barton's hand.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttI'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm 
ttsure he'll want to reschedule your 
ttappointment.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttPerhaps you and I could get together 
ttat some point also. x96I'm sorry if 
ttthat sounds abrupt. I just... I don't 
ttknow anyone here in this town.

tAudrey smiles at him.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttPerhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttPlease, Barton.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttBarton. You see, Barton, I'm not 
ttjust Bill's secretary x96 Bill and I 
ttare... I love. We-

<b>ttttMAYHEW'S VOICE
</b><b>ttM'HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!
</b>
tAudrey glances back as we hear the sound of shattering dishes 
tand heavy footsteps.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI see.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>tt...I know this must look... funny.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo, no x96

tHurriedly:

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttWe need each other. We give each 
ttother...  the things we need x96

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttM'HONEY!!... bastard-ass sons of

<b>ttM'HONEY!!
</b>
<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttI'm sorry, Mr. Fink. Please don't

tFlustered, she backs away and closes the door.

<b>tCLOSE ON A SMALL WRAPPED PACKAGE
</b>
tHand-printed on the package is the message:

t"Hope these will turn the trick, Mr. Fink. x96 Chet!"  

tThe wrapping is torn away and the small box is opened.

tTwo thumbtacks are taken out.

<b>tBARTON'S HOTEL ROOM
</b>
tLate at night. The swath of wallpaper behind the bed has 
tsagged away from the wall again, and has been joined by the 
tswath next to it.

tBarton enters frame and steps up onto the bed.

tHe smooths up the first swath and pushes in a thumbtack near 
tthe top.

<b>tEXTREME CLOSE SHOT
</b>
tOn the tack. As Barton applies pressure to push it in, tacky 
tyellow goo oozes out of the puncture hole and beads around 
tthe tack.

<b>tON BARTON
</b>
tSmoothing up the second swath.

tAs he pushes in the second tack he pauses, listening.  

tMuffled, through the wall, we can hear a woman moaning.  

tAfter a motionless beat, Barton eases his ear against the 
twall.

<b>tCLOSE ON BARTON
</b>
tAs his ear meets the wall.

tThe woman's moaning continues. We hear the creaking of 
tbedsprings and her partner, incongruously giggling.

tBarton grimaces, gets down off the bed and crosses to the 
tsecretary, where he sits. He stares at the paper in the 
tcarriage.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe blank part of the page around the key-strike area, under 
tthe metal prongs that hold the paper down.

tWe begin to hear moaning again.

<b>tBACK TO BARTON
</b>
tStill looking; sweating.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tTracking in on the paper, losing the prongs from frame so 
tthat we are looking at the pure unblemished white of the 
tpage.

tThe moaning is cut short by two sharp knocks.

<b>tTHE DOOR
</b>
tAs it swings open.  Charlie Meadows leans in, smiling.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHowdy, neighbor.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttCharlie. How are you.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttJesus, I hope I'm not interrupting 
ttyou again. I heard you walking around 
ttin here.  Figured I'd drop by.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really 
ttgotten started yet x96 what happened 
ttto your ear?

tx96 for Charle's left ear is plugged with cotton wadding. As 
the enters:

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic 
ttthing.  Goes away for a while, but 
ttit always comes back. Gotta put cotton 
ttin it to staunch the flow of pus. 
ttDon't worry, it's not contagious.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttSeen a doctor?

tCharlie gives a dismissive wave.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAh, doctors. What's he gonna tell 
ttme?  Can't trade my head in for a 
ttnew one.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo, I guess you're stuck with the 
ttone you've got. Have a seat.

tCharlie perches on the corner of the bed.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThanks, I'd invite you over to my 
ttplace, but it's a goddamn mess. You 
ttmarried, Bart?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNope.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI myself have yet to be lassoed.

tHe takes his flask out.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Got a sweetheart?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo... I guess it's something about 
ttmy work. I get so worked up over it, 
ttI don't know; I don't really have a 
ttlot of attention left over, so it 
ttwould be a little unfair...

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah, the ladies do ask for attention. 
ttIn my experience, they pretend to 
ttgive it, but it's generally a smoke-
ttscreen for demanding it back x96 with 
ttinterest. How about family, Bart?  
ttHow're you fixed in that department?

tBarton smiles.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttMy folks live in Brooklyn, with my 
ttuncle.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttMine have passed on. It's just the 
ttthree of us now...

tHe taps himself on the head, chuckling.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...What's the expression x96 me myself 
ttand I.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttSure, that's tough, but in a sense, 
ttwe're all alone in this world aren't 
ttwe Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by 
ttfamily and friends, but...

tHe shrugs.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttMm... You're no stranger to 
ttloneliness, then. I guess I got no 
ttbeef; especially where the dames are 
ttconcerned. In my line of work I get 
ttopportunities galore x96 always on the 
ttwing, you know what I'm saying. I 
ttcould tell stories to curl your hair 
ttx96 but it looks like you've already 
ttheard 'em!

tHe laughs at his reference to Barton's curly hair, and pulls 
ta dog-eared photograph from his wallet. As he hands it to 
tBarton:

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...That's me in Kansas City, plying 
ttmy trade.

<b>tTHE PHOTO
</b>
tCharlie smiles and waves with one foot up on the running 
tboard of a 1939 roadster. A battered leather briefcase dangles 
tfrom one hand.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...It was taken by one of my policy 
ttholders. They're more than just 
ttcustomers to me, Barton.  They really 
ttappreciate what I have to offer them. 
ttYa see, her hubby was out of town at 
ttthe time x96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYou know, in a way, I envy you 
ttCharlie.  Your daily routine x96 you 
ttknow what's expected. You know the 
ttdrill. My job is to plumb the depths, 
ttso to speak, dredge something up 
ttfrom inside, something honest. There's 
ttno road map for that territory...

tHe looks from Charlie to the Underwood.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...and exploring it can be painful. 
ttThe kind of pain most people don't 
ttknow anything about.

tHe looks back at Charlie.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...This must be boring you.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNot at all. It's damned interesting.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah...

tHe gives a sad chuckle.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Probably sounds a little grand 
ttcoming from someone who's writing a 
ttwrestling picture for Wallace Beery.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBeery! You got no beef there! He's 
ttgood.  Hell of an actor x96 though, 
ttfor my money, you can't beat Jack 
ttOakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, 
ttfunny stuff. But don't get me wrong 
ttx96 Beery, a wrestling picture, that 
ttcould be a pip. Wrestled some myself 
ttback in school. I guess you know the 
ttbasic moves.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNope, never watched any. I'm not 
ttthat interested in the act itself x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOkay, but hell, you should know what 
ttit is. I can show you in about thirty 
ttseconds.

tHe is getting down on his hands and knees.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...You're a little out of your weight 
ttclass, but just for purposes of 
ttdemonstration x96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThat's all right, really x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttNot a bit of it, compadre! Easiest 
ttthing in the world! You just get 
ttdown on your knees to my left, slap 
ttyour right hand here...

tHe indicated his own right bicep.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...and your left hand here.

tHe indicated his left bicep.

tBarton hesitates.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...You can do it, champ!

tBarton complies.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...All right now, when I say "Ready...  
ttwrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I 
tttry and pin you. That's the whole 
ttgame. Got it?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Yeah, okay.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttReady... wrestle!

tWith one clean move Charlie flips Barton onto his back, his 
thead and shoulders hitting with a thump. Charlie pins Barton's 
tshoulders with his own upper body.

tBut before the move even seems completed Charlie is standing 
tagain, offering his hand down to Barton.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDamn, there I go again. We're gonna 
ttwake the downstairs neighbors.  I 
ttdidn't hurt ya, did I?

tBarton seems dazed, but not put out.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttIt's okay, it's okay.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, that's all that wrestling is. 
ttExcept usually there's more grunting 
ttand squirming before the pin. Well, 
ttit's your first time. And you're out 
ttof your weight class.

tBarton has propped himself up and is painfully massaging the 
tback of his head. This registers on Charlie.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Jesus, I did hurt you!

tHe clomps hurriedly away.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...I'm just a big, clumsy lug. I 
ttsure do apologize.

tWe hear water running, and Charlie reenters with a wet towel.  

tBarton accepts the towel and presses it to his head.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...You sure you're okay?

tBarton gets to his feet.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm fine, Charlie. Really I am. 
ttActually, it's been helpful, but I 
ttguess I should get back to work.

tCharlie looks at him with some concern, then turns and heads 
tfor the door.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, it wasn't fair of me to do 
ttthat. I'm pretty well endowed 
ttphysically.

tHe opens the door.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Don't feel bad, though. I wouldn't 
ttbe much of a match for you at mental 
ttgymnastics. Gimme a holler if you 
ttneed anything.

tThe door closes.

tBarton crosses to the secretary and sits down, rubbing the 
tback of his head. He rolls up the carriage and looks at the 
tpage in the typewriter.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe page.

<b>ttttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tA TENEMENT BUILDING
</b>
tOn Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is 
taudible, as is the cry fishmongers.

<b>tBACK TO BARTON
</b>
tHe rubs the back of his head, wincing, as he stares at the 
tpage.

tHis gaze drifts up.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe bathing beauty.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tLooking at the picture. He presses the heels of his hands 
tagainst his ears.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe bathing beauty. Faint, but building, is the sound of the 
tsurf.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHead cocked. The surf is mixing into another liquid sound.  
tBarton looks sharply around.

<b>tTHE BATHROOM
</b>
tBarton enters.

tThe sink, which Charlie apparently left running when he wet 
tBarton's towel, is overflowing. Water spills onto the tile 
tfloor.

tBarton hurriedly shuts off the tap, rolls up one sleeve and 
treaches into the sink.

tAs his hand emerges, holding something, we hear the unclogged 
tsink gulp water.

<b>tBARTON'S HAND
</b>
tHolding a dripping wad of cotton.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tAfter a brief, puzzled look he realizes where the cotton 
tcame from x96 and convulsively flips it away.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b>ttttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tON THE TITLE PAGE OF A BOOK:
</b>
<b>t"NEBUCHADNEZZAR  
</b><b>tBY  
</b>tW.P. Mayhew"

tA hand enters with pen to inscribe: "To Barton x96

tMay this little entertainment divert you in your sojourn 
tamong the Philistines.  x96 Bill"

tThe book is closed and picked up.

<b>tWIDER
</b>
tAs-thoomp!-the heavy volume is deposited across the table, 
tin front of Barton, by Mayhew.

tBarton, Mayhew, and Audrey are seated around a picnic table. 
tIt is one of a few tables littering the lot of a small stucco 
topen-air hamburger stand.

tIt is peaceful early evening. The last of the sunlight slopes 
tdown through palm trees. Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are the 
tonly customers at the stand.

tMayhew's black Ford stands alone at the edge of the lot.  

tMayhew leans back in his chair.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttIf I close m'eyes I can almost smell 
ttthe live oak.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttThat's hamburger grease, Bill.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttWell, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish 
tton me x96 lyin' and deceitful...

tHis eyes still closed, he waves a limp hand gently in the 
tbreeze.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>tt...Still, I must say. I haven't felt 
ttpeace like this since the grand 
ttproductive days. Don't you find it 
ttso, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell... actually, no Bill...

tBarton looks nervously at Audrey before continuing.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...No, I've always found that writing 
ttcomes from a great inner pain. Maybe 
ttit's a pain that comes from a 
ttrealization that one must do something 
ttfor one's fellow man x96 to help somehow 
ttto ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a 
ttpersonal pain. At any rate, I don't 
ttbelieve good work is possible without 
ttit.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttMmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' 
ttthings up. Yessir. Escape... It's 
ttwhen I can't write, can't escape 
ttm'self, that I want to tear m'head 
ttoff and run screamin' down the street 
ttwith m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. 
ttMm...

tHe sighs and reaches for a bottle of Wild Turkey.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>tt...This'll sometimes help.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttThat doesn't help anything, Bill.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThat's true, Bill. I've never found 
ttit to help my writing.

tMayhew is becoming testy:

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttYour writing? Son, have you ever 
ttheard the story of Soloman's mammy-

tAudrey, anticipating, jumps hastily in. She taps the book on 
tthe table.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttYou should read this, Barton. I think 
ttit's Bill's finest, or among his 
ttfinest anyway.

tMayhew looks at her narrowly.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttSo now I'm s'posed to roll over like 
ttan ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly 
ttscratched.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttBill x96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttLook, maybe it's none of my business, 
ttbut a man with your talent x96 don't 
ttyou think your first obligation would 
ttbe to your gift? Shouldn't you be 
ttdoing whatever you have to do to 
ttwork again?

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttAnd what would that be, son?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI don't know exactly. But I do know 
ttwhat you're doing with that drink. 
ttYou're cutting yourself off from 
ttyour gift, and from me and Audrey, 
ttand from your fellow man, and from 
tteverything your art is about.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttNo son, thisahere moonshine's got 
ttnothin' to do with shuttin' folks 
ttout. No, I'm usin' it to build 
ttsomethin'.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttI'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, 
ttbrick by brick. Raisin' up a levee 
ttto keep that ragin' river of manure 
ttfrom lappin' at m'door.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttMaybe you better too, Barton. Before 
ttyou get buried under his manure.

tMayhew chuckles.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttM'honey pretends to be impatient 
ttwith me, Barton, but she'll put up 
ttwith anything.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttNot anything, Bill. Don't test me.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYou're lucky she puts up with as 
ttmuch as she does.

tMayhew is getting to his feet.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttAm I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. 
ttPeople who know about the human heart, 
ttthough, mebbe they'd say, Bill over 
tthere, he gives his honey love, and 
ttshe pays him back with pity x96 the 
ttbasest coin there is.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttStop it, Bill!

tHe wanders over to a corner of the lot between two palm trees, 
tstill clutching his bottle, his back to Barton and Audrey, 
tand urinates into the grass.

tHe is singing x96 loudly x96 "Old Black Joe."

tAudrey walks over to him.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tWatching her go.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tAudrey touches Mayhew's elbow. He looks at her, stops singing, 
tshe murmurs something, and he bellows:

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttThe truth, m'honey, is a tart that 
ttdoes not bear scrutiny.

tShe touches him again, murmuring, and he lashes out at her, 
tknocking her to the ground.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttBreach my levee at your peril!

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHe rises.

<b>tAUDREY
</b>
tComing back to Barton.

<b>tMAYHEW
</b>
tStumbling off down the dusty road, muttering to himself and 
twaving his bottle of Wild Turkey.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttLet him go.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThat son of a bitch... Don't get me 
ttwrong, he's a fine writer.

tHe looks down the road. Mayhew is a small lone figure, weaving 
tin the dust.

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttI'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, 
ttand from there I'll... improvise.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttAre you all right?

tWe hear distant bellowing:

<b>ttttMAYHEW
</b>ttSilent upon a hill in Darien!

tAudrey bursts into tears. Barton puts his arms around her 
tand she leans into him.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttAudrey, you can't put up with this.

tGradually, she collects herself, wiping her tears.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>tt...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for 
tthim!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWhat?! He's a son of a bitch!

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttNo, sometimes he just... well, he 
ttthinks about Estelle. His wife still 
ttlives in Fayettesville. She's... 
ttdisturbed.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttReally?...

tHe considers this for a moment, but his anger returns.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Well that doesn't excuse his 
ttbehavior.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttHe'll wander back when he's sober 
ttand apologize. He always does.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttOkay, but that doesn't excuse his x96

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttBarton. Empathy requires... 
ttunderstanding.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWhat. What don't I understand?

tAudrey gazes at him.

<b>tMAYHEW
</b>
tHe is very distant now, weaving but somehow dignified in his 
tlight summer suit. "Old Black Joe" floats back to us in the 
ttwilight.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b>tBARTON'S HOTEL ROOM
</b>
tFrom a high angle, booming down on Barton.

tThe room is dark. Barton lies fully clothed, stretched out 
ton the bed, asleep. The hum of the mosquito fades up in the 
tstillness.

tSuddenly Barton slaps his cheek. His eyes open, but he remains 
tstill. The hum fades up again.  Barton reaches over and turns 
ton the bedside lamp. His eyes shift this way and that as he 
twaits, listening.

tThe hum fades down to silence.

tBarton's eyes shift.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe typewriter sits on the secretary, a piece of paper rolled 
thalfway through the carriage.

<b>tTHE TYPEWRITER
</b>
tBarton enters frame and sits down in front of the typewriter.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tNext to the typewriter are several crumpled pieces of paper.  
tThe page in the carriage reads:

<b>ttttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tA TENEMENT HOTEL
</b>
tOn the Lower East Side. We can faintly hear the cry of the 
tfishmongers. It is too early for us to hear traffic; later, 
tperhaps, we will.

</b>
tLooking down at the page.

tSwinging in the legwell.

tOne foot idly swings over to nudge a pair of nicely shined 
tshoes from where they rest, under the secretary, into the 
tlegwell.

tWe hear typing start.

tA new paragraph being started: "A large man..."

tAs he slides them into the shoes.

t"A large man in tights..."

tThe typing stops.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tLooking quizzically at the page. What's wrong?

<b>tHIS FEET
</b>
tSliding back and forth x96 swimming x96 in his shoes, which are 
tseveral sizes too large.

tWe hear a knock at the door.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHe rises and answers the door.

tCharlie stands smiling in the doorway, holding a pair of 
tnicely shined shoes.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI hope these are your shoes.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHi, Charlie.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBecause that would mean they gave 
ttyou mine.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah, as a matter of fact they did. 
ttCome on in.

tThe two stocking-footed men go into the room and Barton 
treaches under the secretary for Charlie's shoes.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttJesus, what a day I've had. Ever had 
ttone of those days?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttSeems like nothing but, lately.

tChalrie perches on the edge of the bed.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttJesus, what a day. Felt like I 
ttcouldn't've sold ice water in the 
ttSahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't 
ttwant insurance, so okay, that's your 
ttloss. But God, people can be rude. 
ttFeel like I have to talk to a normal 
ttperson like just to restore a little 
ttof my...

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell, my pleasure. I could use a 
ttlittle lift myself.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttA little lift, yeah...

tSmiling, he takes out his flask.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Good thing they bottle it, huh 
ttpal?

tHe takes a glass from the bedstand and, as he pours Barton a 
tshot:

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Did I say rude? People can be 
ttgoddamn cruel. Especially some of 
tttheir housewives. Okay, so I've got 
tta weight problem. That's my cross to 
ttbear. I dunno...

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell it's... it's a defense mechanism.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDefense against what? Insurance?  
ttSomething they need? Something they 
ttshould be thanking me for offering? 
ttA little peace of mind?...

tHe shakes his head.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Finally decided to knock off early, 
tttake your advice. Went to see a doctor 
ttabout this.

tHe indicates his ear, still stuffed with cotton.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...He told me it was an ear infection.  
ttTen dollars, please. I said, hell, I 
tttold YOU my ear was infected. Why 
ttdon't YOU give ME ten dollars? Well, 
ttTHAT led to an argument...

tHe gives a rueful chuckle.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if 
ttmy problems amounted to a hill of 
ttbeans. How goes the life of the mind?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell, it's been better. I can't seem 
ttto get going on this thing. That one 
ttidea, the one that lets you get 
ttstarted x96 I still haven't gotten it.  
ttMaybe I only had one idea in me x96 my 
ttplay. Maybe once that was done, I 
ttwas done being a writer.  Christ, I 
ttfeel like a fraud, sitting here 
ttstaring at this paper.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThose two love-birds next door drivin' 
ttyou nuts?

tBarton looks at him curiously.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHow did you know about that?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttKnow about it? I can practically see 
tthow they're doin' it. Brother, I 
ttwish I had a piece of that.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah, but x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttSeems like I hear everything that 
ttgoes on in this dump. Pipes or 
ttsomethin'. I'm just glad I don't 
tthave to ply MY trade in the wee-wee 
tthours.

tHe laughs.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Ah, you'll lick this picture

tthead on your shoulders. What is it 
ttthey say? Where there's a head, 
ttthere's a hope?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWhere there's life there's hope.

tCharlie laughs.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThat proves you really are a writer!

tBarton smiles.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttAnd there's hope for you too, Charlie.  
ttTomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen 
ttpolicies.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttThanks, brother. But the fact is, I 
ttgotta pull up stakes temporarily.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYou're leaving?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIn a few days. Out to your stompin' 
ttgrounds as a matter of fact x96 New 
ttYork City. Things have gotten all 
ttballed up at the Head Office.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie.  
ttI'll miss you.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell hell, buddy, don't pull a long 
ttface!  This is still home for me x96 I 
ttkeep my room, and I'll be back sooner

tBarton rises and walks over to his writing table.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...And x96 mark my words x96 by the time 
ttI get back you're picture'll be 
ttfinished. I know it.

tBarton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to Charlie.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNew York can be pretty cruel to 
ttstrangers, Charlie. If you need a 
tthome-cooked meal you just look up 
ttMorris and Lillian Fink.  They live 
tton Fulton Street with my uncle Dave.

tWe hear a tacky, tearing sound.

tBarton looks toward the door.

tCharlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where Barton 
tsits.

tThe two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau x96 the 
tslight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in a 
thunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close 
ttogether.

<b>tTHEIR POV
</b>
tA swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from 
tthe wall. It sags and nods.

</b>ttt(off)
ttChrist!

<b>tTHE TWO MEN
</b>
tFrozen, looking.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Your room does that too?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI guess the heat's sweating off the

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat a dump...

tHe heads for the door and Barton follows.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...I guess it seems pathetic to a 
ttguy like you.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell...

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean 
ttto a guy from New York.

</b>ttThis kind of heat. It's pathetic.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttDon't pick up and leave without saying

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttCourse not, compadre. You'll see me 
ttagain.

tBarton closes the door.

tHe goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewriter.  
tAfter a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the 
tceiling.

tWe hear a loud thump.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe ceiling x96 a white, seamless space.

tAs we track in the thumping continues x96 slowly, rhythmically, 
tprogressively louder x96 the effect, it seems, of odd doings 
tupstairs.

<b>tLOOKING DOWN ON BARTON
</b>
tFrom a high angle, tipped back in his chair, staring at the 
tceiling.

tWe track slowly down toward him. The thumping continues, 
tgrowing louder, sharper.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tMoving in on the ceiling. We close in on an unblemished area 
tand cease to have any sense of movement.

tWith a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame 
tto land with a deafening crash, and an instant later it is 
tgone, having left a huge black "T" stamped into the white 
tceiling.

tWe are pulling back from the white, past the metal prongs of 
tthe key-strike area on a typewriter. More letters appear 
trapid-fire, growing smaller as the pull back continues. The 
tthumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter.

<b>tBEN GEISLER
</b>
tIs emerging from his office.  As he enters the secretary 
tstops typing, glances down at a slip of paper, and murmurs 
ttonelessly, without looking up:

<b>ttttSECRETARY
</b>ttBarton Fink.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttYeah. Fink. Come in.

tThe clack of the typewriter resumes as Barton rises.

<b>tGEISLER'S OFFICE
</b>
tThe two men enter.

tThis office is considerably smaller than Lipnik's, done in 
tgrays and black. There are pictures on the wall of Geisler 
twith various celebrities.

tGeisler sits behind his desk.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttWuddya got for me x96 what the hell 
tthappened to your face?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNothing. It's just a mosquito bite.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttLike hell it is; there are no

</b>ttWell I...

</b>ttOn the Beery picture! Where are we?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell, to tell you the truth, I'm

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttGetting STARTED! Christ Jesus! 
ttStarted?!  You mean you don't have 
ttANYthing?!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell not much.

tGeisler leaps to his feet and paces.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttWhat do you think this is? HAMLET? 
<b>ttGONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED 
</b>ttGAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big

</b>ttI'm afraid I don't really understand

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttUnderstand shit! I though you were 
ttgonna consult another writer on this!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-

</b>ttBill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHe's a great writer x96

</b>ttA souse!

</b>ttYou don't understand. He's in pain,
ttbecause he can't write-

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttSouse! Souse! He manages to write 
tthis name on the back of his paycheck 
ttevery week!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttBut... I thought no one cared about 
ttthis picture.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttYou thought! Where'd you get THAT 
ttfrom?  You thought! I don't know 
ttwhat the hell you said to Lipnik, 
ttbut the sonofabitch LIKES you! You 
ttunderstand that, Fink? He LIKES you! 
ttHe's taken an interest. NEVER make 
ttLipnik like you. NEVER!

tSome puzzlement shows through Barton's weariness.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI don't understand-

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttAre you deaf, he LIKES you! He's 
tttaken an interest! What the hell did 
ttyou say to him?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI didn't say anything-

ttwhich I could care less about, but 
ttsince I drew the short straw to

ttcalled me yesterday to ask how it's 
ttgoing x96 don't worry, I covered for 
ttyou. Told him you were making progress 
ttand we were all very excited. I told 
tthim it was great, so now MY ass is

tthim all about it tomorrow.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI can't write anything by tomorrow.

</b>ttWho said write? Jesus, Jack can't 
ttread.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell 
tthim SOMEthing for Chrissake.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell what do I tell him?

tGeisler rubs a temple, studies Barton for a beat, then picks 
tup a telephone.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>ttProjection...

tAs he waits, Geisler gives Barton a withering stare. It 
tcontinues throughout the phone conversation.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>tt... Jerry? Ben Geisler here. Any of 
ttthe screening rooms free this 
ttafternoon?...  Good, book it for me. 
ttA writer named Fink is gonna come in 
ttand you're gonna show him wrestling 
ttpictures... I don't give a shit which 
ttones! WRESTLING pictures!  Wait a 
ttminute- isn't Victor Sjoderberg 
ttshooting one now?... Show him some 
ttof the dailies on that.

tHe slams down the phone.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>tt...This ought to give you some ideas.

tHe jots an address on a piece of paper and hands it to Barton.

<b>ttttGEISLER
</b>tt...Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at 
ttLipnik's house. Ideas. Broad strokes.  
ttDon't cross me, Fink.

<b>tSCREEN
</b>
tBlack-and-white footage. A middle-aged man with a clapstick 
tenters and shouts:

<b>ttttCLAPPER
</b>ttDEVIL ON THE CANVAS, twelve baker 
tttake one.

tClap! The clapper withdraws. The angle is on a corner of the 
tring, where an old corner man stands behind his charge, a 
thuge man in tights who is a little too flabby to be a real 
tathlete. His hair is plastered against his bullet skull and 
the has a small mustache.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAction.

tThe wrestler rises from his stool and heads toward center 
tring and the camera. He affects a German accent:

<b>ttttWRESTLER
</b>ttI will destroy him!

tHe passes the camera.

</b>ttCut.

tFlash frames.

tThe clapper enters again.

tSeated alone in a dark screening room, the shaft of the 
tprojection beam flickering over his left shoulder.

tAs we creep in closer:

ttI will destroy him!... I will destroy

tAnother off-microphone, distant voice from the screen:

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOkay, take five...

<b>tTHE SCREEN
</b>
tA jerky pan, interrupted by flash frames. The wrestler is 
tstanding in a corner joking with a makeup girl who pats down 
this face as he smokes a cigarette.

tA cut in the film and another clapstick enters.

</b>
tThe angle is low x96 canvas level. We hold for a brief moment 
ton the empty canvas before two wrestlers crash down into

<b>tPAGE IN TYPEWRITER
</b>
tThe screaming drops out abruptly at cut. We hear only the 
tsound of heavy footfalls on carpet.

tBelow the opening paragraph, two new words have been added 
tto the typescript:

t"Orphan?"

t"Dame?"  

tThe foot falls continue.

<b>tTHE HOTEL ROOM

tNight. Barton paces frantically back and forth.

tHe looks at his watch.

tIt is 12:30.

tIt is lifted out of the cradle.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in

tWe pull back to frame in Barton as we hear his call ring 
tthrough.  Barton sweats.

tThrough the phone, in the background, we hear Mayhew's drunken 
tbellowing.

</b>ttSons of bitches! Drown 'em all!

tWe hear various objects dropping or being thrown to the floor.

</b>ttAll right Barton, I'll see if I can

<b>ttttMAYHEW

</b>
<b>tWIDE ON THE ROOM
</b>
tLater. It is quiet. We are craning down toward the bed, where 
tBarton lies stretched out, his head buried beneath a pillow 
tas if to blot out the world.

tThe track reveals the wristwatch on Barton's dangled arm: 
<b>t1:30.
</b>
<b>tTHE HALLWAY
</b>
tAt the end of the dimly lit corridor a red light blinks on 
tover the elevator, with a faint bell.

<b>tBACK TO BARTON
</b>
tWith two violent and simultaneous motions he whips the pillow 
toff his head and throws out his other wrist to look at his 
twatch.

tThere is a knock at the door.

tBarton swings his feet off the bed.

<b>tTHE DOORWAY
</b>
tBarton opens the door to Audrey.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttHello, Barton.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttAudrey, thank you for coming. Thank 
ttyou.  I'm sorry to be such a... such 
tta... Thank you.

tThey enter the main room, where Audrey perches on the edge 
tof the bed.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttNow that's all right, Barton.  
ttEverything'll be all right.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYes. Thank you. How's Bill?

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttOh, he's... he drifted off. He'll 
ttsleep for a while now. What is it 
ttyou have to do, exactly?

tBarton paces.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell I have to come up with x96 an 
ttoutline, I'd guess you call it. The 
ttstory. The whole goddamn story. Soup 
ttto nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttIt's alright, Barton. You don't have 
ttto write actual scenes?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo, but the whole goddamn x96 Audrey?  
ttHave you ever had to read any of 
ttBill's wrestling scenarios?

tAudrey laughs.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttYes, I'm afraid I have.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWhat are they like? What are they 
ttabout?

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttWell, usually, they're... simply 
ttmorality tales. There's a good 
ttwrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he 
ttconfronts at the end. In between, 
ttthe good wrestler has a love interest 
ttor a child he has to protect.  Bill 
ttwould usually make the good wrestler 
tta backwoods type, or a convict. And 
ttsometimes, instead of a waif, he'd 
tthave the wrestler protecting an idiot 
ttmanchild.  The studio always hated 
ttthat. Oh, some of the scripts were 
ttso... spirited!

tShe laughs x96 then stops, realizing that she has laughed. She 
tlooks at Barton.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>tt...Barton.

tShe shakes her head.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>tt...Look, it's really just a formula. 
ttYou don't have to type your soul 
ttinto it.  We'll invent some names 
ttand a new setting.  I'll help you 
ttand it won't take any time at all. I 
ttdid it for Bill so many times x96

tBarton's pacing comes up short.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttDid what for Bill?

tGuardedly:

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttWell... THIS.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYou wrote his scripts for him?

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttWell, the basic ideas were frequently 
tthis-

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYou wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus 
ttChrist, you wrote his x96 what about 
ttbefore that?

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttBefore what?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttBefore Bill came to Hollywood.

tAudrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttWell, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so 
ttto speak-

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWhat do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, 
tthow long have you been his... 
ttsecretary?

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttBarton, I think we should concentrate 
tton OUR little project-

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI want to know how many of Bill's 
ttbooks you wrote!

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttBarton!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI want to know!

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttBarton, honestly, only the last couple-

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHah!

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttAnd my input was mostly... EDITORIAL,
ttreally, when he'd been drinking-

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'll bet. Jesus x96 "The grand 
ttproductive days." What a goddamn 
ttphony.

tHe resumes pacing.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...W.P. Mayhew.  William Goddamn 
ttPhony Mayhew. All his guff about 
ttescape. Hah!  I'LL say he escaped!

tBarton sighs and looks at his watch.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Well, we don't have much time.

tHe sits down next to Audrey. Audrey's tone is gentle.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>ttIt'll be fine... Don't judge him, 
ttBarton.  Don't condescend to him...

tShe strokes Barton's hair.

<b>ttttAUDREY
</b>tt...It's not as simple as you think. 
ttI helped Bill most by appreciating 
tthim, by understanding him. We all 
ttneed understanding, Barton. Even 
ttyou, tonight, it's all you really 
ttneed...

tShe kisses him.

tAs Barton tentatively responds, we are panning away.

tWe frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward 
tthe sink. We can hear the creak of bedsprings and Audrey and 
tBarton's breath, becoming labored.

tThe continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the 
tsink to frame up its drain, a perfect black circle in the 
tporcelain white.  We track up to the drain and are enveloped 
tby it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of 
tpipes.

<b>tttttttBLACK
</b>
<b>ttttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tBARTON
</b>
tThe hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we are 
tlooking down at Barton, in bed, asleep. It is dawn.

tBarton's eyes snap open.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe white ceiling. A humming black speck flits across the 
twhite.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tSlowly, cautiously, he props himself up, his look following 
tthe sound of the mosquito.

tHis gaze travels down and to one side and is arrested as the 
thum stops.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tAudrey lies facing away on her side of the bed, half covered 
tby a blanket.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tGingerly, he reaches over and draws the blanket down Audrey's 
tback.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe alabaster white of Audrey's back.

tThe mosquito is feeding on it.

<b>tEXTREME CLOSE ON BARTON'S EYES
</b>
tLooking.

<b>tEXTREME CLOSE ON THE MOSQUITO
</b>
tSwelling with blood.

<b>tWIDER
</b>
tAs Barton's hand comes through frame and slaps Audrey's back.  

tShe doesn't react.

tBarton draws his hand away. Audrey's back is smeared with 
tblood.

<b>tON BARTON
</b>
tHe looks at his hand.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tHis hand is dripping with blood. Too much blood.

<b>tBACK TO BARTON
</b>
tEyes wide, he looks down at the bed.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tBlood seeps up into the sheet beneath the curve of Audrey's 
tback.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHe pulls Audrey's shoulder.

<b>tAUDREY
</b>
tShe rolls onto her back. Her eyes are wide and lifeless.  

tHer stomach is nothing but blood. The top sheet, drawn to 
ther waist is drenched red and clings to her body.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHe screams.

tHe screams again.

tWe hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door, a door opening 
tand closing, and then a loud banging on Barton's door.  

tBarton's head spins towards the door. He is momentarily 
tfrozen.

tAnother knock.

tBarton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door.

<b>tTHE DOORWAY
</b>
tOver Barton's shoulder as he cracks the door.

tCharlie stands in the hall in his boxer shorts and a 
tsleeveless tee.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAre you all right?

tBarton stares dumbly for a moment.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Can I come in?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo!... I'm fine. Thank you.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttAre you sure x96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo... no...

tBarton is nodding as he shuts the door in Charlie's face.  

tHe walks back into the room.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tAudrey's corpse, in long shot, face up on the bed.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHe walks toward the bed, wheels before he reaches it, and 
tstarts back toward the door.

tHe stops short and turns back again to the room. He averts 
this eyes x96 as it happens, toward the secretary.

tHe walks stiffly over and sits, his back to Audrey.

<b>tCLOSE ON BARTON
</b>
tAs he sits in. He stares emptily down at the desk, in shock, 
ttotally shut down. Behind him, we can see Audrey on the bed.  

tHe stares for a long beat.

tStrange, involuntary noises come from his throat. He is not 
tin control.

tBecoming aware of the noise he is making, he stops.

tHe lurches to his feet.

<b>tTHE DOORWAY
</b>
tAs Barton enters, opens the door, and sticks his head out.

<b>tHALLWAY
</b>
tBarton peers out the see if the coast is clear.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe long hallway.

tIn the deep background, Chet, the night clerk, is stooping 
tin front of a door to pick up a pair of shoes. Next to him 
tis a castored shoe caddy.

tAll of the doorways between us and Chet are empty of shoes.

<b>tCHET
</b>
tClose on him as, mid-stoop, he looks up.

<b>tCHET'S POV
</b>
tUp the long hall. In the deep background a door is closing.

<b>tCHET
</b>
tHe pauses, then straightens up and puts the shoes on the 
tshoe caddy. It squeaks as he pushes it on down the hall.

<b>tBARTON'S ROOM
</b>
tBarton stands at the door, listening to a very faint squeak.  
tEventually it becomes inaudible.

tHe cracks the door again, looks out, and exits.

<b>tHALLWAY
</b>
tBarton goes to Charlie's room and knocks.

tFootfalls end as the door is cracked open.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBarton. Are you all right?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo... Can I come in?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhy don't we go to your room-

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttCharlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta 
tthelp me.

tOnce again he is breathing hard.

tCharlie steps out into the hall and shuts the door behind 
thim.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttGet a grip on yourself, brother. 
ttWhatever the problem is, we'll sort 
ttit out.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttCharlie, I'm in trouble x96 something 
tthorrible's happened x96 I've gotta 
ttcall the police...

tCharlie leads him towards his room.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Will you stay with me till they 
ttget here?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDon't worry about it, Barton. We can 
ttsort it-

tHe is pushing Barton's door open, but Barton grabs an elbow 
tto stop him.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttBefore you go in x96 I didn't do this. 
ttI don't know how it happened, but I 
ttdidn't... I want you to know that...

tCharlie looks into his eyes. For a moment the two men stare 
tat each other x96 Charlie's look inquisitive, Barton's 
tsupplicating.

tFinally, Charlie nods.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttOkay.

tHe turns and pushes open the door.

<b>tBARTON'S ROOM
</b>
tThe two men enter.

tBarton lingers by the door. Charlie walks into the foreground 
tto look off toward the bed.

tHis eyes widen and he screams.

tHe turns and disappears into the bathroom. We hear vomiting, 
tthen the flush of a toilet.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttJesus... Jesus... Jesus have mercy...

tHis reaction has not encouraged Barton, who is more and more 
tagitated.

tCharlie emerges from the bathroom, sweating.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is 
ttthis?  What're we gonna do?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI've gotta call the police x96 or you

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHold on x96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYou gotta believe me x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHold on x96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI didn't do this, I did NOT do thisx96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. 
ttTell me what happened.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI don't know! I woke up, she was... 
ttGod, you gotta believe me!

tCharlie, in spite of himself, is sneaking horrified glances 
tback into the room.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI believe you, brother, but this 
ttdon't look good.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWe gotta call the police x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHold on. I said hold on, so hold on.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWhat do you think happened?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI don't know!  Maybe it was her...

ttknow.  Won't the police be able to x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttStop with the police! Wake up, friend!  
ttThis does not look good! They hang 
ttpeople for this!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttBut I didn't do it x96 don't you believe 
ttme?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI believe you x96 I KNOW you. But why 
ttshould the police?

tBarton gives him a dumb stare.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Did you... Barton, between you 
ttand me, did you have sexual 
ttintercourse?

tBarton stares at Charlie. He swallows.

tCharlie shakes his head.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttJesus... They can tell that...

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThey GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They 
ttgotta have mercy!

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou're in pictures, Barton. Even if 
ttyou got cleared eventually, this 
ttwould ruin you.

tHe turns and starts toward the bed.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Wait in the bathroom.

<b>tBATHROOM
</b>
tLater. Barton, still in his underwear, sits leaning against 
tthe wall, staring glassily at his feet.

tFrom the other room we hear the creak of bedsprings and the 
tsounds of bed clothes being torn off.

tFinally there is a last creak of bedsprings and the sound of 
tCharlie grunting under great weight.

tWe hear heavy footsteps approaching.

tBarton looks up through the open bathroom door.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tCharlie is groping for the front doorknob, cradling the 
tsheetswaddled body in his arms.

<b>tBACK TO BARTON
</b>
tHis neck goes rubbery. His eyes roll up. His head lolls back 
tto hit the wall.

<b>tBLACK
</b>
tSlap! Slap!  

tWe are low on Charlie, who is following through on a slap 
tand backing away, having aroused Barton. Charlie is now 
twearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee, which has 
tblood flecks across the belly.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou passed out.

tBarton looks groggily up.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttShe's dead, Barton! If that was her 
ttname.

<b>tTRACKING IN ON BARTON
</b>
tHe stares at Charlie.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(off)
ttBarton, listen to me. You gotta act 
ttlike nothing's happened. Put this 
tttotally out of your head. I know 
ttthat's hard, but your play from here 
tton out is just to go about business 
ttas usual. Give us some time to sort 
ttthis out...

tBarton looks at his watch.

<b>tTHE WATCH
</b>
<b>t7:45.
</b>
<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(off)
tt...Just put it out of you head...

<b>tTRACKING
</b>
tToward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and 
tstatuary set amid palms trees.

tSunlight glitters angrily off the water; we are approaching 
tJack Lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttBart! So happy to see ya!

<b>tREVERSE
</b>
tPulling Barton, who is being escorted by Lou Breeze.

tBarton is haggard, sunken eyes squinting against too much 
tsun.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttSit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then 
tttalk!  Drink?

tAs Barton sits:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah... rye whiskey?

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttBoy! You writers! Work hard, play 
tthard!  That's what I hear, anyway...

tHe laughs, then barks at Lou Breeze.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt... Lou.

tLou exits.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttAnyway. Ben Geisler tells me things're 
ttgoing along great.  Thinks we've got 
tta real winner in this one. And let 
ttme tell you something, I'm counting 
tton it. I've taken an interest. Not 
ttto interfere, mind you x96 hardly seems 
ttnecessary in your case. A writer x96 a 
ttstoryteller x96 of your stature.  
ttGivitta me in bold strokes, Bart. 
ttGimme the broad outlines. I'm sitting 
ttin the audience, the lights go down, 
ttCapitol logo comes up... you're on!

tHe beams expectantly at Barton.  Barton licks his parched 
tlips.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah, okay... well... we fade in...

tLipnik is nodding, already involved in the story.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...It's a tenement building. On the 
ttLower East Side...

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttGreat! He's poor, this wrestler! 
ttHe's had to struggle!

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttAnd then... well...

tBarton looks back out at the pool, his eyes closed to slits 
tagainst the sun. He looks back at Lipnik.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttCAN you?  You damn well better be. 
ttJesus, if I hadn't been honest in my 
ttbusiness dealings x96 well, of course, 
ttyou can't always be honest, not with 
ttthe sharks swimming around this town 
ttx96 but if you're a writer, you don't 
ttthink about those things x96 if I'd 
ttbeen totally honest, I wouldn't be 
ttwithin a mile of this pool x96 unless 
ttI was cleaning it. But that's no 
ttreason for you not to be. Honest, I 
ttmean.  Not cleaning the pool.

tLou has entered with a drink, which he sets next to Barton. 
tLou sits.

tBarton looks around, takes the drink, sips at it greedily, 
tbut must finally take the plunge.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell... to be honest, I'm never really 
ttcomfortable discussing a work in 
ttprogress.  I've got it all worked 
ttout in my head, but sometimes if you 
ttforce it out in words x96 prematurely 
ttx96 the wrong words x96 well, your meaning 
ttchanges, and it changes your own 
ttmind, and you never get it back x96 so 
ttI'd just as soon not talk about it.

tLipnik stares at him. His smile has disappeared. There is a 
tlong beat.

tLou Breeze clears his throat. He apparently feels obliged to 
tfill the silence.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>tt...Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never 
ttmind how long I've been in pictures. 
ttMr. Lipnik has been in pictures just 
ttabout since they were invented. HE 
ttpractically invented them.

tLipnik has turned to look curiously at Lou.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>tt...Now I think if he's interested in 
ttwhat one of his contract employees 
ttis doing while he draws pay, I think 
ttthat employee ought to tell him, if 
tthe wants to stay an employee. Right 
ttnow the contents of your head are 
ttthe property of Capitol Pictures, so 
ttif I were you I would speak up. And 
ttpretty goddamn fast.

tLou looks at Barton, expectantly. Lipnik continues to stare 
tat Lou.

tThere is a long silence, terribly heavy.

tFinally, Lipnik explodes x96 at Lou.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttYou lousy sonofabitch! You're telling 
ttthis man x96 this ARTIST x96 what to 
ttdo?!

tLou Breeze is stunned.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttMr. Lipnik, I x96

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttThis man creates for a living! He 
ttputs food on your table and on mine! 
ttTHANK him for it!  Thank him, you 
ttungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or 
ttYOU'RE fired!

tBarton is staring, aghast.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttMr. Lipnik, that's not really necessar-

tLipnik, still staring at Lou, gives no sign of hearing Barton. 
tHe rises and points.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttGet down on your knees, you 
ttsonofabitch!  Get down on your knees 
ttand kiss this man's feet!

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttMr. Lipnik, please x96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI x96 Mr. Lipnik x96

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b><b>ttKISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
</b>
tLou, aghast, looks at Barton.

tBarton, aghast, can only return the same stunned look.

tLipnik snarls at Lou:

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt...Okay, get out of here. You're 
ttfired, you understand me?  Get out 
ttof my sight.

tLou gets stiffly to his feet and stumbles away.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttMr. Lipnik, I x96

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttI apologize, Barton.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNo no, Mr. Breeze has actually been 
tta great help x96

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttYou don't have to cover for him. 
ttIt's noble of you, but these things 
tthappen in business.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttMr. Lipnik, I really would feel much 
ttbetter if you could reconsider x96

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttAh, forget it, kid. I want you to 
ttpull this out of your head. If that 
ttsonofabitch wouldn't apologize to 
ttyou, goddammit, I will. I respect 
ttyour artistry and your methods, and 
ttif you can't fill us in yet, well 
tthell, we should be kissing your feet 
ttfor your fine efforts.

tHe gets down on his knees in front of Barton.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt...You know in the old country we 
ttwere taught, as very young children, 
ttthat there's no shame in supplicatin' 
ttyourself when you respect someone.

tBarton stares, horrified, at Lipnik, on the ground at his 
tfeet.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt...On behalf of Capitol Pictures, 
ttthe administration, and all a the 
ttstockholders, please accept this as 
tta symbol of our apology and respect.

<b>tBARTON'S POV
</b>
tLipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him.

tBehind Lipnik the pool glitters.

<b>tBARTON'S ROOM
</b>
tThe cut has a hard musical sting. Out of the sting comes a 
tloud but distorted thumping noise.

tWe are looking down, high angle, form one corner of the room. 
tWe are presented with a motionless tableau: Barton sits, 
thunched, in the far corner, elbows on knees, staring at the 
tbed in front of him. He wears only trousers and a T-shirt 
tand his body and face glisten with sweat. The bed's sheets 
thave been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous 
trust-red stain in the middle.

tAfter a beat, in the foreground, the only motion in the scene: 
tA bead of tacky yellow wall-sweat dribbles down the near 
twall.

tSilence, then the thumping repeats, resolving itself to a 
tknock at the door.

tBarton rises slowly and crosses to the door.

<b>tTHE DOOR
</b>
tBarton opens it to Charlie, who is dressed in a baggy suit, 
this hair slicked back, a tan fedora pushed back on his head. 
tIt is the first time we have seen him well turned out.

tA battered briefcase is on the floor next to him. He holds a 
tparcel in his left hand, about one foot square, wrapped in 
tbrown paper and tied up with twine.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBarton. Can I come in?

tBarton stands back from the door and Charlie picks up his 
tbriefcase and enters.

<b>tTHE ROOM
</b>
tAs the two men enter.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttJesus... You're leaving.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHave to, old timer. Just for a while.

tBarton sounds desperate:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttJesus, Charlie, I...

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttEverything's okay, believe me. I 
ttknow it's rough mentally, but 
tteverything's taken care of.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttCharlie! I've got no one else here! 
ttYou're the only person I know in Los 
ttAngeles...

tHe starts weeping

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...that I can talk to.

tCharlie, also disturbed and unhappy, wraps both arms around 
tBarton.

tBarton sobs unashamedly into his shoulder. Charlie is somber.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttIt's okay... It's okay...

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttCharlie, I feel like I'm going crazy 
ttx96 like I'm losing my mind. I don't 
ttknow what to do... I didn't do it, 
ttbelieve me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. 
ttI just...

tHis breath comes in short gasping heaves.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...I just don't know what... to dox96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYou gotta get a grip on, brother. 
ttYou gotta just carry on x96 just for a 
ttfew days, till I get back. Try and 
ttstay here, keep your door locked. 
ttDon't talk to anyone. We just gotta 
ttkeep our heads and we'll figure it 
ttout.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah, but Charlie x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDammit, don't argue with me. You 
ttasked me to believe you x96 well I do.  
ttNow don't argue with me.

tHe looks at Barton for a beat.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Look, pal x96 can you do something 
ttfor me?

tCharlie hands him his parcel.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Keep this for me, till I get back.

tBarton, snuffling, accepts the package.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...It's just personal stuff. I don't 
ttwanna drag it with me, but I don't 
tttrust 'em downstairs, and I'd like 
ttto think it's in good hands.

tStill snuffling:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttSure, Charlie.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttFunny, huh, when everything that's 
ttimportant to a guy, everything he 
ttwants to keep from a lifetime x96 when 
tthe can fit it into a little box like 
ttthat. I guess... I guess it's kind 
ttof pathetic.

tWallowing in self-pity:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttIt's more than I've got.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttWell, keep it for me. Maybe it'll 
ttbring you good luck. Yeah, it'll 
tthelp you finish your script. You'll 
ttthink about me...

tHe thumps his chest.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Make me your wrestler. Then you'll 
ttlick that story of yours.

tBarton is tearfully sincere:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThanks, Charlie.

tCharlie solemnly thrusts out his hand.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttYeah, well, see you soon, friend. 
ttYou're gonna be fine.

tBarton shakes. As they walk to the door:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYou'll be back?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDon't worry about that, compadre. 
ttI'll be back.

tBarton shuts the door behind Charlie, locks it, and turns 
taround.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe room. The bed. The blood-stained mattress.

tBarton walks across the room and sits carefully at the edge 
tof the bed, avoiding the rust-colored stain. For a long beat, 
the sits still, but something is building inside.

tFinally, when we hear the distant ding of the elevator 
tarriving for Charlie, it erupts:

tBarton sobs, with the unself-conscious grief of an abandoned 
tchild.

<b>tHIGH WIDE SHOT
</b>
tBarton weeping, alone on the bed, next to the rust-colored 
tstain.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b>ttttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tBATHING BEAUTY
</b>
tWith the fade in, the sound of the surf mixes up.

tWe pan down the picture to discover that a snapshot has been 
ttucked into a corner of the picture frame: it is the snap of 
tCharlie, smiling and waving, with his foot up on the running 
tboard of the 1939 Ford roadster.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tSitting at the desk, staring at the picture. From his glazed 
teyes and the way his mouth hangs open, we may assume he has 
tbeen staring at the picture for some time.

tHe notices something on the desk and picks it up.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe Holy Bible x96 Placed by the Gideons.

tBarton opens it, randomly, to the Book of Daniel. The text 
tis set in ornately Gothic type.

t"5. And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the 
tChaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known 
tunto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in 
tpieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill."

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tStaring at the passage. His mouth hangs open.

<b>tTHE BIBLE
</b>
tBarton riffles to the first page.

tIn bold type at the top:

<b>t"THE BOOK OF GENESIS"
</b>
tUnderneath, in the same ornately Gothic type:

t"Chapter One 1. Fade in on a tenement building on Manhattan's 
tLower East Side.  Faint traffic noise is audible; 2. As is 
tthe cry of fishmongers."

tSquinting at the page through bloodshot eyes.

tHis mouth hangs open.

<b>tBARTON'S ROOM x96 DAY
</b>
tAt the cut the harsh clackety-clack of typing bangs in. 
tSunlight burns against the sheers of Barton's window, making 
tit a painfully bright patch in the room which itself remains 
tfairly dim.

tBarton sits at the secretary, typing furiously.

tHe finishes a page, yanks it out of the carriage, and places 
tit face-down on a short stack of face-down pages.

tHe feeds in a blank sheet and resumes his rapid typing. He 
tis sweating, unshaven, and more haggard even than when we 
tleft him the previous night.

tThe telephone rings. After several rings Barton stops typing 
tand answers it, absently, still looking at his work. His 
tvoice is hoarse.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHello... Chet... Who?...

tHe puts the receiver down on the desk, leans over the 
ttypewriter, and examines something he has just written.

tHe picks the phone back up and listens for a beat.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt... No, don't send them up here. 
ttI'll be right down.

<b>tELEVATOR
</b>
tA small oscillating fan whirs up in a corner of the elevator.  

tWe pan down to Barton, who is riding down with Pete, the old 
televator operator. Barton's voice is hoarse with fatigue.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...You read the Bible, Pete?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttHoly Bible?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttI think so... Anyway, I've heard 
ttabout it.

tBarton nods.

tThey ride for a beat.

<b>tLOBBY
</b>
tLate afternoon sun slants in from one side. The lobby has 
tthe same golden ambiance as when first we saw it.

tBarton is walking toward two wing chairs in the shadows, 
tfrom which two men in suits are rising. One is tall, the 
tother short.

tAll three sit in ancient maroon swing chairs. Mastrionotti 
tperches on the edge of his chair; Deutsch slumps back in the 
tshadows, studying Barton.

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttGot a couple questions to ask ya.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttWhat do you do, Fink?

tStill hoarse:

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttOh yeah? What kind of write?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWell as a matter of fact, I write

tHe is holding a small black-and-white photograph out toward 
tBarton.

tThere is a long beat as Barton studies the picture.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Yeah, he... he lives next door to 
ttme.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttThat's right, Fink, he lives next

</b>ttEver talk to him?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Once or twice. His name is Charlie

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttYeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttHis name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttAlso known as Madman Mundt.

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttHe's a little funny in the head.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWhat did... What did he x96

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttFunny. As in, he likes to ventilate 
ttpeople with a shotgun and then cut

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttYeah, he's funny that way.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b><b>ttI...

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttBut, you know, with the head still

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...No. I never saw him with anyone

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttSo. You talked to Mundt, what about?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNothing, really. Said he was in the

tDeutsch indicates Mastrionotti.

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttYeah, and he's Buck Rogers.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttNo reputable company would hire a

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttWhat else?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHe... I'm trying to think... Nothing,

ttJack Oakie pictures.

tMastrionotti looks at Deutsch. Deutsch looks at Mastrionotti.  
tAfter a beat, Mastrionotti looks back at Barton.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttYa know, Fink, ordinarily we say 
ttanything you might remember could be 
tthelpful. But I'll be frank with you: 
ttThat is not helpful.

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttYa see how he's not writing it down?

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttFink. That's a Jewish name, isn't 
ttit?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah.

tMastrionotti gets to his feet, looking around the lobby.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttYeah, I didn't think this dump was 
ttrestricted.

tHe digs in his pocket.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>tt...Mundt has disappeared. I don't

tHe hands Barton a card.

<b>tBARTON'S ROOM
</b>
tWe are tracking toward the paper-wrapped parcel that sits on 
tthe nightstand next to Barton's bed.   

tBarton enters and picks it up. He holds it for a beat, looking 
tat it, then brings it over to the secretary and sits.

tHe shakes it.

tNo sound; whatever is inside is well packed.

tBarton holds it up to his ear and listens for a long beat, 
tas if it were a seashell and he is listening for the surf.  

tFinally he puts it on his desk, beneath the picture of the 
tbathing beauty, and starts typing, quickly and steadily.

<b>ttttttttDISSOLVE
</b>
<b>tttttt    THROUGH TO:
</b>
<b>tREVERSE
</b>
tSome time later; Barton still types. He is face to us; beyond 
thim we can see the bed with its rust-colored stain.

tThe phone rings. Barton ignores it. It continues to ring.  

tBarton rises and exits frame; we hold on to the bed in the 
tbackground. We hear Barton's footsteps on the bathroom tile 
tas the phone continues ringing.

tBarton sits back into frame stuffing cotton into each ear. 
tHe resumes typing.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tBarton typing. The desk trembles under the working of the 
ttypewriter.  Charlie's parcel chatters.

tBarton takes a finished page out of the carriage and places 
tit face down on the growing stack to his right. He feeds in 
ta new page. We hear the muted ding of the elevator down the 
thall. Barton resumes typing.

tWe hear a knock on Barton's door. Barton does not react, 
tapparently not hearing.

<b>tTHE DOORWAY
</b>
tWe are close on the bottom of the door. Someone in the hallway 
tis sliding a note beneath the door; then his shadow disappears 
tand his footsteps recede.

tThe note is a printed message headed: "While You Were Out... 
t" Underneath are the printed words: "You were called by" 
tand, handwritten in the space following: "Mr. Ben Geisler."  

tHandwritten below, in the message space:

t"Thank you. Lipnik loved your meeting. Keep up the good work." 

tBarton's offscreen typing continues steadily.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b>tHALLWAY
</b>
tA perfectly symmetrical wide low angle shot of the empty 
thall.  Shoes are set put in front of each door except for 
tone in the middle background.

tAt the cut in we hear faint, regular typing.

tWe hold for a beat. There is no motion. The long, empty hall. 
tThe distant typing.

tWe hold.

tThe typing stops. There is a beat of quiet.

tIt is broken by the sound of a door opening. It is the 
tshoeless door in the middle background.

tA hand reaches out to place a pair of shoes in the doorway.  

tThe hand withdraws.

tThe door closes.

tA short beat of silence.

tThe distant typing resumes.

tThe long empty hall. The distant typing.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b>tOVER THE BLACK

tWe hear the distant sound of a woman's voice, tinny and 
tindistinct.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttJust a minute and I'll connect you...

<b>ttttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tCLOSE ON BARTON
</b>
tHis eyes are red-rimmed and wild. He sits on the edge of his 
tbed holding the phone to his ear.

tHis voice is unnaturally loud:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHello? Operator! I can't... Oh!

tHe stops, reaches up, takes a cotton wad out of his ear.

tWe hear various clicks and clacks as the telephone lines 
tswitch, and then a distant ring. The phone rings three or 
tfour times before it is answered by a groggy voice.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tt...Hello.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttGarland, it's me.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttBarton? What time is it? Are you all

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYeah, I'm fine, Garland x96 I have to 
tttalk to you. I'm calling long

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttOkay.

tMuffled, we hear Garland speaking to someone else.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>tt...It's Barton. Calling long distance.

tBack into the receiver:

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>tt...What is it Barton? Are you okay?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm fine, garland, but I have to 
tttalk with you.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttGo ahead, son.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttIt's about what I'm writing, Garland. 
ttIt's really... I think it's really 
ttbig.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttWhat do you mean, Barton?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttNot big in the sense of large x96 
ttalthough it's that too. I mean 
ttimportant. This may be the most 
ttIMPORTANT work I've done.

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttWell, I'm... glad to hear that x96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttVery important, Garland. I just 
ttthought you should know that. Whatever

</b>tt...That's fine.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttHave you read the Bible, Garland?

</b>ttYes... Isn't it?

tGuardedly:

<b>ttttGARLAND
</b>ttWell, you just... sound a littlex96

tBitterly:

</b>ttThanks, Garland. Thanks for all the 
ttencouragement.

tHe slams down the phone.

<b>tOVER HIS SHOULDER
</b>
tA one-quarter shot on Barton from behind as he picks up the 
tcotton wad and sticks it back in his right ear.

tHe resumes typing, furiously.

tAfter a beat he mutters, still typing.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...Nitwit.

<b>tTHE BATHING BEAUTY
</b>
tLater. We hear typing and the roar of the surf.'

<b>tCLOSE ON TYPEWRITER
</b>
tWe are extremely close on the key-strike area. As we cut in 
tBarton is typing:

t"p-o-s-t-c-a-r-d-."

tThe carriage returns a couple of times and "T-H-Ex96E-N-D" is 
ttyped in.

tThe paper is ripped out of the carriage.

<b>tCLOSE ON A STACK OF PAGES
</b>
tLying face down on the desk; the last page is added, face 
tdown, to the pile.  The pile is picked up, its edges are 
tstraightened with a couple of thumps against the desktop, 
tand then the pile is replaced on the desk, face up.  The 
ttitle page reads:

<b>t"THE BURLYMAN 
</b>tMotion Picture Scenario 
tBy 
tBarton Fink"

tBarton's right hand enters frame to deposit a small cotton 
twad on top of the script.

tBarton's left hand enters to deposit another small cotton 
twad on top of the script.

tWe hear Barton walk away. We hear bath water run.

<b>tTHE BATHING BEAUTY
</b>
tStill looking out to sea.

<b>tUSO HALL
</b>
tWe are booming down to the dance floor as a raucous band 
tplays an up-tempo number.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tDancing animatedly, almost maniacally, his fingers jabbing 
tthe air.

tThe hall is crowded, but Barton is one of few men not in 
tuniform.

<b>tUSO GIRL
</b>
tGiggling, dancing opposite Barton.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttYou're cute!

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tCaught up in his dancing, oblivious to the girl.

tA white uniformed arm reaches in to tap Barton on the 
tshoulder.

<b>ttttSAILOR
</b>tt'Scuse me, buddy, mind if I cut in?

tBarton glares at him.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttThis is MY dance, sailor!

<b>ttttSAILOR
</b>ttC'mon buddy, I'm shipping out 
tttomorrow.

tFor some reason, Barton is angry.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm a writer! Celebrating the 
ttcompletion of something GOOD!  Do 
ttyou understand that, sailor? I'm a

</b>
tHis bellowing has drawn onlookers' attention.

<b>ttttVOICES
</b>ttStep aside, four-eyes! Let someone

tBarton turns furiously against the crowd.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm a writer, you monsters! I CREATE!  
ttHe points at his head.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...This is my uniform!

tHe taps his skull.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...THIS is how I serve the common

tWHAPP! An infantry man tags Barton's chin on the button. 
tBodies surge. The crowd gasps. The band blares nightmarishly 
ton.

<b>tHOTEL HALLWAY
</b>
tQuiet at the cut.

tAfter a beat, there is a faint ding at the end of the hall 
tand, as the elevator door opens, we faintly hear:

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttThis stop: six.

tBarton, disheveled, emerges and stumbles wearily down the 
thall. He stops in front of his door, takes his key out, and 
tenters the room.

<b>tBARTON'S POV
</b>
tMastrionotti is sitting on the edge of the bed reading 
tBarton's manuscript.

tDeutsch stands in front of the desk staring at the bathing 
tbeauty.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttMother: What is to become of him. 
ttFather: We'll be hearing from that 
ttcrazy wrestler.  And I don't mean a

tHe looks up at Barton.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>tt...I thought you said you were a 
ttwriter.

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttI dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttKeep your filthy eyes off that.

tDeutsch turns toward Barton and throws a folded newspaper at 
thim.

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttYou made morning papers, Fink.

tBarton opens the paper. A headline reads: Writer Found 
tHeadless in Chavez Ravine. The story has two pictures x96 a 
tstudio publicity portrait of Mayhew, and a photograph of the 
tcrime scene: two plainclothes detectives stare down into a 
tgulley as a uniformed cop restrains a pair of leashed dogs.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttSecond one of your friends to end up

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttYou didn't tell us you knew the dame.

tbloodstained bed.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>ttSixth floor too high for you, Fink?

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttGive you nose bleeds?

tBarton crosses the room and sits at the foot of the bed, 
tstaring at the newspaper.

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttJust tell me one thing, Fink: Where'd

tDistractedly:

<b>ttttDEUTSCH
</b>ttAll right, moron, you're under arrest.

tBarton seems oblivious to the two men.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttCharlie's back. It's hot... He's 
ttback.

tDown the hall we hear the ding of the arriving elevator.  

tMastrionotti cocks his head with a quizzical look.

tHe rises and walks slowly out into the hall. Deutsch wathces

</b>
tMastrionotti in the hallway in full shot, framed by the door, 
tstill looking puzzled.

<b>ttttMASTRIONOTTI
</b>tt...Fred...

tDeutsch stands and pushes his suit coat back past the gun on 
this hip, revealing a pair of handcuffs on his belt. He 
tunhitches the cuffs and slips one around Barton's right wrist 
tand the other around a loop in the wrought iron footboard of 
tthe bed.

<b>tTHE WALL
</b>
tTacky yellow fluid streams down. The walls are pouring sweat.  

tThe hallway is quiet.

<b>tMASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH
</b>
tThey look at each other. They look down the hall.

<b>tTHEIR POV
</b>
tThe elevator stands open at the far end of the empty hall.  

tFor a long beat, nothing.

tFinally Pete, the elevator man, emerges.

tAt this distance, he is a small figure, stumbling this way 
tand that, his hands presseed against the sides of his head.  

tHe turns to face Mastrionotti and Deutsch and takes a few 
tsteps forward, still clutching his head.

<b>tMASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH
</b>
tWatching.

<b>tPETE
</b>
tHe takes on last step, then collapses.

tAs he pitches forward his hands fall away from his head. His 
thead separates from his neck, hits the floor, and rolls away 
tfrom his body with a dull irregular trundle sound.

<b>tMASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH
</b>
tWide-eyed, they look at each other, then back down the hall.  

tAll is quiet.

<b>tTHE HALLWAY
</b>
tSmoke is beginning to drift into the far end of the hall.  

tWe hear a muted rumble.

<b>tMASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH
</b>

tMore smoke.

<b>tPATCH OF WALL
</b>
tSweating.

tA swath of wallpaper sags away from the top of the wall,

tWith a light airy pop, the lathwork catches on fire.

tWith a groan of tension relieved cables and a swaying of the 
televator door, a pair of feet crosses the threshold into the 
tdoorway.

<b>tJUMPING BACK
</b>
tWide on the hallway. Charlie Meadows has emerged from the 
televator and is hellishly backlit by the flame.

tHis suit coat hangs open. His hat is pushed back on his head. 
tFrom his right hand his briefcase dangles.

tHe stands motionless, facing us. There is something monumental 
tin his posture, shoulders thrown back.

</b><b>ttLOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE 
</b><b>ttOF THE MIND! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE 
</b><b>ttOF THE MIND!
</b>
<b>tDEUTSCH
</b>
tTerrified, he turns and runs.

<b>tREVERSE PULLING DEUTSCH
</b>
tAs he runs down the flaming hallway, pursued by flames, smoke, 
tand Karl Mundt x96 who, also on the run, levels his shotgun.

<b>tBOOM!
</b>
<b>tPUSHING DEUTSCH
</b>
tHis legs and feet spout blood, paddle futilely at the air, 
tthen come down in a twisting wobble, like a car on blown 
ttires, and pitch him helplessly to the floor.

<b>tPULLING CHARLIE
</b>
tHe slows to a trot and cracks open the shotgun.

<b>tPUSHING DEUTSCH
</b>
tWeeping and dragging himself forward on his elbows.

<b>tPULLING CHARLIE
</b>
tHe slows to a walk.

<b>tBARTON'S ROOM
</b>
tBarton strains at his handcuffs.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThrough the open doorway we see Charlie pass, pushing two 
tshells into his shotgun.

<b>tPULLING DEUTSCH
</b>
tCharlie looms behind him and x96 THWACK x96 snaps the shotgun 
tclosed.

tDeutsch rolls over to rest on his elbows, facing Charlie.  

tCharlie primes the shotgun x96 CLACK.

tHe presses both barrels against the bridge of Deutsh's nose.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHeil Hitler.

<b>tDEUTSCH
</b>
tScreams.

<b>tCHARLIE
</b>
tTightens a finger over both triggers. He squeezes.

<b>tBLAM!
</b>
<b>tTRACK IN ON BARTON
</b>
tHe flinches.

tThe gunshot echoes away.

tBarton strains at the handcuffs.

tWe hear Charlie's footsteps approach x96 slowly, heavily.

<b>tTHE DOORWAY
</b>
tCharlie, walking down the hall, glances in and seems mildly 
tsurprised to see Barton. The set of his jaw relaxes. His 
texpression softens. He pushes his hat farther back on his 
thead.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBarton!

tHe shakes is head and whistles.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Brother, is it hot.

tHe walks into the room.

<b>tBARTON'S ROOM
</b>
tAs Charlie wearily enters.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttHow you been, buddy?

tHe props the shotgun in a corner and sits facing Barton, who 
tstared at him.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Don't look at me like that, 
ttneighbor.  It's just me x96 Charlie.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.

tCharlie reaches a flask from his pocket.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttJesus, people can be cruel...

tHe takes a long draught from his flask, then gives a haunted 
tstare.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...if it's not my build, it's my 
ttpersonality.

tCharlie is perspiring heavily. The fire rumbles in the 
thallway.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...They say I'm a madman, Barton, 
ttbut I'm not mad at anyone. Honest 
ttI'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry 
ttfor. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to 
ttthink about what they're going 
ttthrough. How trapped they are. I 
ttunderstand it. I feel for 'em. So I 
tttry and help them out...

tHe reached up to loosen his tie and pop his collar button.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels 
ttlike, when things get all balled up 
ttat the head office. It puts you 
ttthrough hell, Barton. So I help people 
ttout. I just wish someone would do as 
ttmuch for me...

tHe stares miserably down at his feet.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Jesus it's hot. Sometimes it gets 
ttso hot, I wanna crawl right out of 
ttmy skin.

tSelf-pity:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttBut Charlie x96 why me? Why x96

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttBecause you DON'T LISTEN!

tA tacky yellow fluid is dripping from Charlie's left ear and 
trunning down his cheek.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Jesus, I'm dripping again.

tHe pulls some cotton from his pocket and plugs his ear.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...C'mon Barton, you think you know 
ttabout pain? You think I made your 
ttlife hell?  Take a look around this 
ttdump. You're just a tourist with a 
tttypewriter, Barton. I live here. 
ttDon't you understand that...

tHis voice is becoming choked.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...And you come into MY home... And 
ttyou complain that I'M making too... 
ttmuch... noise.

tHe looks up at Barton.

tThere is a long silence.

tFinally:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...I'm sorry.

tWearily:

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttDon't be.

tHe rises to his feet and kneels in front of Barton at the 
tfoot of the bed.

tThe two men regard each other.

tCharlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame, still staring 
tat Barton. His muscles tighten, though nothing moves. His 
tneck fans with effort. All of his muscles tense.  His face 
tis a reddening grimace.

tWith a shriek of protest, the metal gives. The bar to which 
tBarton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and Barton 
tslides the cuff off it, free.

tCharlie gets to his feet.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttI'm getting off the merry-go-round.

tHe takes his shotgun and walks to the door.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...I'll be next door if you need me.

tA thought stops him at the door and he turns to face Barton.  
tBehind him the hallway blazes.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Oh, I dropped in on your folks. 
ttAnd Uncle Dave?

tHe smiles. Barton looks at him dumbly.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt...Good people. By the way, that 
ttpackage I gave you? I lied. It isn't 
ttmine.

tHe leaves.

tBarton rises, picks up Charlie's parcel, and his script.

<b>tTHE HALLWAY
</b>
tAs Barton emerges. Flames lick the walls, causing the 
twallpaper to run with the tack glue sap. Smoke fills the 
thallway. Barton looks down the hall.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tCharlie stands in front of the door to his room, his briefcase 
tdangling from one hand, his other hand fumbling in his pocket 
tfor his key.

tWith his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders slumped 
twith fatigue, he could be any drummer returning to any hotel 
tafter a long hard day on the road.

tHe opens the door and goes into his room.

<b>tBACK TO BARTON
</b>
tHe turns and walks up the hallway, his script in one hand, 
tthe parcel in the other.

tA horrible moaning sound x96 almost human x96 can be heard under 
tthe roar of the fire.

<b>tBLACKNESS
</b>
<b>tSTUDIO HALLWAY
</b>
tWe are tracking laterally across the lobby of an executive 
tbuilding. From offscreen we hear:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttFink! Morris or Lillian Fink! Eighty- 
ttfive Fulton Street!

tFiltered through phone:

<b>ttttOPERATOR
</b>ttI understand that, sir x96

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttOr Uncle Dave!

tOur track has brought Barton into frame in the foreground, 
tunshaven, unkempt, bellowing into the telephone. In a hallway 
tin the background, a secretary gestures for Barton to hurry 
tup.

<b>ttttOPERATOR
</b>ttI understand that, sir, but there's 
ttstill no answer. Shall I check for 
tttrouble on the line?

tBarton slams down the phone.

<b>tLIPNIK'S OFFICE
</b>
tBarton enters, still clinging on to Charlie's parcel.

tLou Breeze stands in one corner censoriously watching Barton.  
tLipnik is at the far end of the room, gazing out the window.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttFink.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttMr. Lipnik.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttColonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.

tHe turns to face Barton and we see that he is wearing a 
tsmartly pressed uniform with a lot of fruit salad on the 
tchest.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt...Siddown.

tBarton takes a seat facing Lipnik's desk.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt...I was commissioned yesterday in 
ttthe Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau 
ttarranged it. He's a dear friend.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttCongratulations.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttActually it hasn't officially gone 
ttthrough yet. Had wardrobe whip this 
ttup. You gotta pull teeth to get 
ttanything done in this town. I can 
ttunderstand a little red tape in 
ttpeacetime, but now it's all-out 
ttwarfare against the Japs. Little 
ttyellow bastards.  They'd love to see 
ttme sit this one out.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYes sir, they x96

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttAnyway, I had Lou read your script 
ttfor me.

tHe taps distastefully at the script on his desk, which has a 
tslightly charred title page.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>tt...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't 
ttwash.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttWith all due respect, sir, I think 
ttit's the best work I've done.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttDon't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion 
ttmattered, then I guess I'd resign 
ttand let YOU run the the studio. It 
ttdoesn't and you won't, and the 
ttlunatics are not going to run THIS 
ttparticular asylum. So let's put a 
ttstop to THAT rumor right now.

tListlessly:

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYes sir.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttI had to call Beery this morning, 
ttlet him know we were pushing the 
ttpicture back.  After all I'd told 
tthim about quality, about that Barton 
ttFink feeling. How disappointed we 
ttwere. Wally was heartbroken. The man 
ttwas devastated. He was x96 well, I 
ttdidn't actually call him, Lou did. 
ttBut that's a fair description, isn't 
ttit Lou?

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYes, Colonel.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttHell, I could take you through it 
ttstep by step, explain why your story 
ttstinks, but I won't insult your 
ttintelligence. Well all right, first 
ttof all: This is a wrestling picture; 
ttthe audience wants to see action, 
ttdrama, wrestling, and plenty of it. 
ttThey don't wanna see a guy wrestling 
ttwith his soul x96 well, all right, a 
ttlittle bit, for the critics x96 but 
ttyou make it the carrot that wags the 
ttdog. Too much of it and they head 
ttfor exits and I don't blame 'em.  
ttThere's plenty of poetry right inside 
ttthat ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten 
ttFeet Square".

<b>ttttLOU
</b>tt"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttLook at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". 
ttThese are big movies, Fink. About 
ttbig men, in tights x96 both physically 
ttand mentally. But especially 
ttphysically. We don't put Wallace 
ttBeery in some fruity movie about 
ttsuffering x96 I thought we were together 
tton that.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI'm sorry if I let you down.

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttYou didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. 
ttWe don't live or die by what you 
ttscribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler 
ttdown. He liked you. Trusted you. And 
ttthat's why he's gone. Fired.  That 
ttguy had a heart as big as the 
ttoutdoors, and you fucked him. He 
tttried to convince me to fire you 
tttoo, but that would be too easy. No, 
ttyou're under contract and you're 
ttgonna stay that way.  Anything you 
ttwrite will be the property of Capitol 
ttPictures. And Capitol Pictures will 
ttnot produce anything you write. Not 
ttuntil you grow up a little. You ain't 
ttno writer, Fink x96 you're a goddamn 
ttwrite-off.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI tried to show you something 
ttbeautiful.  Something about all of 
<b>ttUS x96
</b>
tThis sets Lipnik off:

<b>ttttLIPNIK
</b>ttYou arrogant sonofabitch!  You think 
ttyou're the only writer who can give 
ttme that Barton Fink feeling?!  I got 
tttwenty writers under contract that I 
ttcan ask for a Finktype thing from. 
ttYou swell-headed hypocrite!  You 
ttjust don't get it, do you?  You think 
ttthe whole world revolves inside 
ttwhatever rattles inside that little 
ttkike head of yours. Get him outta my 
ttsight, Lou. Make sure he stays in 
tttown, though; he's still under 
ttcontract. I want you in town, Fink, 
ttand outta my sight. Now get lost. 
ttThere's a war on.

<b>tTHE SURF
</b>
tCrashing against the Pacific shore.

<b>tTHE BEACH
</b>
tAt midday, almost deserted. In the distance we see Barton 
twalking.

tThe paper-wrapped parcel swings from the twine in his left 
thand.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHe walks a few more paces and sits down on the sand, looking 
tout to see. His gaze shifts to one side.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tDown the beach, a bathing beauty walks along the edge of the 
twater. She looks much like the picture on the wall in Barton's 
thotel room.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tHe stares, transfixed, at the woman.

<b>tTHE WOMAN
</b>
tVery beautiful, backlit by the sun, approaching.

<b>tBARTON
</b>
tFollowing her with his eyes.

<b>tTHE WOMAN
</b>
tHer eyes meet Barton's. She says something, but her voice is 
tlost in the crash of the surf.

tBarton cups a hand to his ear.

<b>ttttBEAUTY
</b>ttI said it's a beautiful day...

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttYes... It is...

<b>ttttBEAUTY
</b>ttWhat's in the box?

tBarton shrugs and shakes his head.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttBEAUTY
</b>ttIsn't it yours?

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>ttI... I don't know...

tShe nods and sits down on the sand several paces away from 
thim, facing the water but looking back over her shoulder at 
tBarton.

<b>ttttBARTON
</b>tt...You're very beautiful. Are you in 
ttpictures?

tShe laughs.

<b>ttttBEAUTY
</b>ttDon't be silly.

tShe turns away to look out at the sea.

<b>tWIDER
</b>
tFacing the ocean. Barton sits in the middle foreground, back 
tto us, the box in the sand next to him.

tThe bathing beauty sits, back to us, in the middle background.  
tThe surf pounds.

tThe sun sparkles off the water.
