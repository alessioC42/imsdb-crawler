<b>tMRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
tBegin on black.  The sound of rain driving into trees. 
tSomething wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through
ta forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN
tBROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and
tright, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his
tleft.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past
tsaplings and plunges on.

<b>tEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
tClose-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for
tair.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome,
tbruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark. 
tStops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he
thears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and
traces on.

<b>tEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
tBROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
tlength, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now
tthere's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps
tfallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes
tforward, never stumbling once.

<b>tEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
</b>
tBROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and
tstops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow
tcircle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the
twildly swaying trees.

tThere's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins
tround, bellows deep from his heart:

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttGod save the Queen!!

tAnd fires.

tNothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes
ton screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into
tempty space.  A pause.

tSlowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on
thim that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees,
twaving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol
tdrop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face. 
tAnd now, for the first time, we see that his socks have
tfallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He
tshifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He
tgoes on staring into the dark.  Nothing. 
tJust the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher
tand higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:

<b>ttttttFADE TO BLACK.
</b>
<b>tCAPTION: "1864"
</b>
<b>ttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>ttttPONSONBY (V.O.)
</b>ttI have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from
ttBalmoral.  Her majesty has mentioned
tthim, on one or two occasions, as being
tta most devoted outdoor servant to
ttPrince Albert during his last days
ttthere...

tJohn BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.

<b>tttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe screen is black.  As the camera pulls back, we discover
tthat we are looking at a black night-gown.

tQueen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an
telderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair.

<b>ttttPONSONBY (V.O.)
</b>tt... The depths of the Queen's sorrow
ttremain impenetrable.  She has now
ttrestricted herself to a regime of such
ttferocious introspection that we are
ttall at our wits' end...

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRINCE ALBERT'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tA bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black.  His desk
tis laid out as if for work.  A VALET is brushing one of his
tsuits before laying it carefully on the bed.

<b>ttttPONSONBY (V.O.)
</b>tt... The Household continues, at her
ttinstruction, to observe the rituals
ttnow so familiar to her, in a vain
ttattempt to render vivid that which can
ttnever be revived...

tClose-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed
tcarefully beside a dish of freshly poured water.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe hairdresser is pulling VICTORIA's hair back into the
twidow's cape.  For the first time, we see her face.  It is
tset in a mask of severity.

<b>ttttPONSONBY (V.O.)
</b>tt... It will not surprise you to hear
ttthat she continues steadfast in her
ttrefusal to accept any public
ttengagements, however trivial...

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY
</b>
tA bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal
tbed.  His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side.

tA somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed:
tDOCTOR JENNER, the Queen's physician.  He is placing
tpotions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table.

tBehind him, TWO MAIDSERVANTS are busy stripping and
tremaking the bed while another raises the window to air the
troom.

<b>ttttPONSONBY (V.O.)
</b>tt... Family and staff expend all their
ttefforts endeavouring to draw her out
ttof this state of unfettered morbidity,
ttbut to no avail.  Indeed, Doctor
ttJenner will not undertake to vouchsafe
tther sanity, unless some remedy is
ttfound...

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tVICTORIA is turning slowly around as a young ASSISTANT
tDRESSER completes the fastening on her black crepe dress.

<b>ttttPONSONBY (V.O.)
</b>tt... We must hope, therefore, that this
ttMr Brown will appeal to the Queen's
ttsentimental, though deeply-held, view
ttthat all Highlanders are good for the
tthealth.  If she can at least be
ttpersuaded to take the air, the
ttprospect of further recovery may seem
ttless remote...

tThe assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress. 
tVICTORIA winces slightly.

<b>ttttASSISTANT DRESSER
</b>ttt(terrified)
ttSorry, ma'am.

<b>tEXT. THE SEA FRONT, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY
</b>
tWe glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads:
<b>t"ISLE OF WIGHT. 1864."
</b>
tA DRIVER stands against the sea front with a horse and cart
tbearing the Royal coat of arms.

tJohn BROWN leads his pony along the dockside, towards the
twaiting driver.  He is in his late thirties, fit, handsome
tand dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket.

<b>ttttPONSONBY (V.O.)
</b>tt... He is arriving by boat this
ttafternoon, by which time it is hoped
ttHer Majesty will be in a fit state to
ttconsider riding out...

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
tSIR HENRY PONSONBY, the Queen's Private Secretary, is
tsitting at his writing desk, completing a letter.

<b>ttttPONSONBY (V.O.)
</b>tt... As to that decision, along with
ttall others, we remain, as ever,
ttprisoners of the Queen's grief.
ttt(beat)
ttEver your devoted husband, Henry.

tHe folds the letter and slips it into an envelope.  He is a
tmiddle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine
tand with a civil servant's stoop.  As he looks up, we see a
twhite-stockinged FOOTMAN standing to attention by the door. 
tPONSONBY hands the letter to him.

<b>ttttPONSONBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttWindsor.

<b>tttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tCAPTION: "OSBORNE HOUSE, ISLE OF WIGHT"
</b>
<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tA series of windows are being slammed open by white
tstockinged FOOTMEN as members of the ROYAL FAMILY and UPPER
tHOUSEHOLD hurry by in silence, all dressed in mourning and
trushing to make the luncheon hour.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tQueen VICTORIA heads down the empty corridor with two
tladies-in-waiting, LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL, hurrying
talong a pace behind.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tMembers of the Royal family and upper household hurry into
tthe icy dining room and take their designated places at the
tluncheon table.  Everybody is dressed in mourning and
tnobody speaks.  Wind whistles through the open windows. 
tSilence.

tAmong the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the
tPrince of Wales.  He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff
tdressed and balding.  He stands next to his young wife,
tPRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl,
ttrying to keep warm.

tAs BERTIE smooths down his thinning hair, DOCTOR JENNER
tbustles into the dining room, stands himself next to
tPONSONBY and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation
twith the Prince of Wales, entirely in whispers.

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttCongratulations, Your Royal Highness!

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttThank you, Doctor.

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttA boy, I hear.  Excellent, excellent.

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttYes.
ttt(beat)
ttAlbert Victor.  Eddie for short.  What
ttdo you think?

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttA fine choice, sir.

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttExcellent!

<b>tEXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY
</b>
tJOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the
tcarrier bearing the Royal coat of arms.  The DRIVER leans
tin.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttAre you riding up front?

tBROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI'll stay with the pony, thank you. 
ttShe's all the way from Deeside and
ttshe's not sure she likes you yet.

tThe DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tVICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep
tbreath.  LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttHow many?

tLADY ELY is slightly taken aback.

<b>ttttLADY ELY
</b>ttThe Royal Family and senior members of
ttthe household, ma'am.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttJust them?

<b>ttttLADY ELY
</b>ttYes, ma'am.

tVICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps
tthrough the door.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tEveryone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in.  Acknowledging the
tother diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place.

tShe flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else
tsits and does the same.  The meal is served immediately by
twaiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony.

tIt's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables.  VICTORIA
tstarts eating heartily, straight away.  Everyone does the
tsame.

tOnly the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence.

<b>tEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY
</b>
tThe Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on
tdown the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns
tstretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne
tHouse.  A few outdoor servants watch its progress
tcuriously.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain
tpudding.  Immediately, servants appear at every place and
twhip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have
tfinished or not.  Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the
troutine.  DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat.

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttWe're expecting Brown this afternoon,
ttma'am.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttWhom?

tA beat.  VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with
ther napkin and rises.  Everyone else rises too.  Suddenly,
tthe Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS
tALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:

<b>ttttVICTORIA (CONT'D)
</b>ttThat's a very pretty shawl you are
ttwearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.
ttt(beat)
ttBut you are not eating enough.  One
ttmust not let vanity overrule one's
ttappetite.

<b>ttttPRINCESS ALEXANDRA
</b>ttYes, ma'am.

tVICTORIA nods earnestly.  Lost to the effect her words have
thad, she marches out again.  Behind her, she leaves
tPRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in
tfront of all the others.  BERTIE takes her hand and
tsqueezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.

<b>tEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tThe horse-carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance
tand the DRIVER opens the doors.

tJOHN BROWN pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks
tthe time.  His eyes narrow critically.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI was due at a quarter past one.
ttt(beat)
ttYou're late.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
tA few minutes later, JOHN BROWN strides down the long
tcorridor with PONSONBY at his side.  Their journey takes
tthem down an endless series of corridors, past servants and
thouseholders hurrying about their duties.  The presence of
tthe dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed
tportraits and busts that crop up along the way.

tBROWN and PONSONBY could not be more contrasted.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttt(in low tones)
ttHer Majesty's routine at Osborne House
ttis not as you will remember it.  The
ttHousehold remains in full mourning and
ttno-one is permitted to raise their
ttvoice under any circumstances
ttwhatsoever.  As for the Queen's
ttroutine, she breakfasts at nine
ttthirty, lunches at two,takes tea at
ttfive thirty and dinner at eight forty
ttfive.  No one is allowed to leave the
ttbuilding while the Queen is at home. 
ttOn the rare occasions when she is out,
ttyou may ask permission to leave, but
ttonly with my consent. 
ttYou're to be ready to walk the pony at
ttany time after ten o'clock.  You'll
ttclean her outdoor things and do any
ttodd jobs as and when she requires.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttHow will I know?

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttt(surprised to be interrupted)
ttI'm sorry?

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttHow will I know what she requires?

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttYou'll be sent a message.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttWho'll bring it to me?

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttHer Highness' Equerry.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI need a man who knows where I am.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttI'm sure it won't be difficult to find
ttyou.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttThat's not good enough.

tA beat.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttThen we'll have to see what can be
ttarranged.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttAye, do.

tPONSONBY stiffens.  A beat.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttThere is to be no communication with
ttother members of the household on
ttmatters concerning the court except
ttthrough myself or one of the
ttEquerries.  No plans must be altered
ttunless you are given prior authority
ttby myself or a senior member of the
tthousehold.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI came down at the Queen's request. 
ttI'll take my orders from her.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttIn matters concerning the Household, I
ttact on her behalf.

tBROWN takes the measure of him.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttDo you?

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttYes.
ttt(beat)
ttI do.

tBROWN glances up the corridor.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttSo, is passing wind out of the
ttquestion or do I need permission for
ttthat?

tPONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard.  They
treach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the
tinterview.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttAs I am sure you remember from
ttBalmoral, you do not talk while in Her
ttMajesty's presence unless Her Majesty
ttaddresses you directly.

tBROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks.  After a
tmoment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tBROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops.  PONSONBY
twaits by the door.

<b>ttttPONSONBY (O.S.)
</b>ttMr Brown, ma'am.

tVICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her
tnumerous red boxes.  She scribbles furiously at a letter,
tunderlining and accenting words as she goes.  Finally, LADY
tELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear. 
tShe carries on working.

tBROWN has time to survey the room.  Dominating everything
tare the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince
tAlbert glimpsed in the corridor.

tFinally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward. 
tHe steps up in front of the desk and waits.  VICTORIA looks
tup and BROWN bows deeply.

tSilence.

tShe stares at him for a long moment without apparently
tregistering who he is.  He towers over her, in bright
ttartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black
tand knotted with tension.

tFinally, she finds her voice.  She sounds nervous and edgy.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttMr Brown.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttMa'am.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttYou are here safely.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttAye, ma'am.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttYou are well?

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI am.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttAnd the pony?

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttShe's well, too.

tVICTORIA blinks at the sight of him.  His presence is
tbringing him back.  A beat.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttYour family sent cards.  It was much
ttappreciated.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI'm glad of it.

tIn an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds
tthe same severe note as at lunch.  But BROWN, unlike
tothers, seems unaffected.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttMy husband was always very
ttcomplimentary in speaking of you.  He
ttwould have approved, I am sure, of my
ttcalling on you in this way.
ttt(beat)
ttI trust it does not inconvenience you
tttoo much.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI've no family, ma'am, apart from my
ttbrothers and sisters.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttYes.
ttt(beat)
ttYou have a brother in service here, do
ttyou not?
ttt(furrowing her brow)
ttI forget his name.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttArchie.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttYes.
ttt(beat)
ttThat will be company for you.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttYes, ma'am.

tSilence.  VICTORIA starts to tire.  She takes a sip of
twater and spills a little on herself.  Flustered, she
tsearches for a hanky but cannot find one.  LADY ELY hurries
tup with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off.  BROWN
twatches all of this with genuine concern.  When VICTORIA
tfinally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.

<b>ttttBROWN (CONT'D)
</b>ttHonest to God, I never thought to see
ttyou in such a state.  You must miss
tthim dreadfully.

tVICTORIA stares back in stunned silence.  PONSONBY coughs
tinvoluntarily.  LADY ELY freezes.  A beat.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttYou do not - he ... get him out.
ttt(beat)
ttGet him out.  Get him out!

tSuddenly, BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the
troom.  LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts
therself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
tSome minutes later, BROWN is angrily unpacking a trunk. 
tHis humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary
tferocity with which he slams down every object.

tHis younger brother, ARCHIE, sits on the bed.  He's in his
tearly thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same
tdistinctive kilt and tweed.

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttt(telling it fast)
ttSo the day they arrive, she greets the
ttSultan and his family with barely a
ttword and then retires to her chamber. 
ttThe Sultan, not used to State
ttOccasions without a head of State, is
ttstanding in the lobby waiting for
ttsomeone to tell him what to do.  But
ttthe court is under strict instructions
ttnot to talk in the corridors so nobody
ttspeaks to him, not a living soul, for
ttthe whole afternoon.  So now it's
ttdinner and everyone's standing round
ttthe table -- still not a word --
ttwaiting for Her Majesty to arrive. 
ttOne hour goes by, two, the Sultan's
ttgetting a wee bit peckish to say the
ttleast.  So finally, his wee laddy
ttbreaks for the cold meats and stuffs a
ttslice in his mouth.  Well, the uproar
ttwhen she heard.  You'd have thought
ttsomeone had stolen the crown jewels.

tBROWN stares back, still pissed off.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttSo?

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttSo, there are rules.  Things you do
ttand things you don't do.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI was just telling the woman how I
ttfeel, for God's sake.

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttYou don't tell Her Majesty how you
ttfeel.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI speak as I find, Archie.

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttNot down south you don't.

tBROWN slams a drawer shut.  ARCHIE lets it go and watches
this brother.  A beat.

<b>ttttARCHIE (CONT'D)
</b>ttSo what did Ponsonby do when she
ttstarted shouting?

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI think he nearly ruptured his truss.

tA beat, then both men burst out laughing.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, SERVANT'S HALL - DAY
</b>
tThe clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants
thurry about with plates, knives and forks, laying the Upper
tServant's huge table for dinner.  ARCHIE leads BROWN
tthrough this rush of activity.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttHow much?

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttSeventy a year.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttNot bad, not bad.

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttHow about yourself?

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttSixty.

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttt(grinning)
ttThat's pretty good for a ghillie.

tBROWN smiles dryly.  They pour themselves a drink from the
ttable.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttPrince Leopold?  Is he the one who
ttbleeds all day?  So what does his
ttvalet do?  Wash his poultices for him?

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttIt's better than shovelling horse
ttshit.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttIf you were looking for promotion, you
ttshould have picked one of the
tthealthier ones.

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttShe's hardly a full hamper herself.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttt(beat)
ttIt's only grief makes her like she is.

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttThree years, John.  Is that not a bit
ttlong to be grieving?

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttShe loved him.

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttCome on, man.  There's love and
ttthere's ...

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttYou know what I mean.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI'm not sure I do, Archie.

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttThere's love and there's behaving like
ttyou do because there's nobody to tell
ttyou not to.

tHold on BROWN.  He lets it go and moves on.  Across the
thall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttWhich one of us is she flirting with?

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttThe good-looking one.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttAye?  Then she's obviously not got
ttenough to do.

<b>ttttARCHIE
</b>ttYou work the system right, you could
ttask her yourself.  Just be thankful
ttyou're not working for Household.  The
ttQueen never lets them out of her
ttsight.  But wee spats like us can slip
ttthrough the net, easy.

tA beat.  BROWN stares straight at him.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI'm no wee spat, ARCHIE.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING
</b>
tThe next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a
tcorridor on her way into the dining room.  VICTORIA
tsuddenly stops and stares out of the windows.  Her
tentourage are several steps past her before they realize
twhat's happened and scurry back to take up their positions
tbehind.

tNow we see what has caught her attention.  BROWN is
tstanding in the courtyard below, by his pony.  She watches
thim for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.

<b>tEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</b>
tSome hours later.  It is now raining.

tA gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage
tfrom their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES
tfrantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas.  John
tBROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush
taround him, laughing and giggling.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING
</b>
tRain on the window.  VICTORIA is walking in the opposite
tdirection down the corridor with her entourage.  She stops

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttI'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't

</b>ttWhat on earth did you think you were
ttdoing?

tBROWN stares straight back.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttAwaiting my orders.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttYou do not report for duty unless the

</b>ttI didn't come all this way to sit on

</b>ttI beg your pardon?

</b>
tThe next day.  From a high window, we see PONSONBY
tscuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of
tJOHN BROWN, who is standing exactly as he was the day
tbefore.

tVICTORIA watches impassively.

<b>tEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, COURTYARD - DAY
</b>
tPONSONBY stands close to BROWN, shouting in his face.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttI thought I made myself perfectly

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttt(eyes straight ahead,

ttWell, you tell Her Majesty from me, if
tther husband was here now, he'd have
tthad her out of that house and getting

tFrom the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words.  A

</b>ttGo inside at once.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttIs that the Queen's request?

</b>ttYes, it most certainly is!

tto the stables.

tA few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling
this horse.  Suddenly he turns.

</b>ttMr Brown.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttYes, ma'am.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttYou have been told repeatedly not to

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttYes, ma'am.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttThen why do you persist in doing it?

</b>ttBecause I think Her Majesty is wrong.

</b>ttThe Queen will ride out if and when

</b>ttPrince Albert was going to build a

</b>ttIt's a fine spot, ma'am.

<b>ttttVICTORIA (CONT'D)
</b>ttIn everything I do and everything I

tShe stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in.

</b>ttIf Prince Albert were here today, he'd
tttell him a thing or two.

</b>ttSir Henry is not alone.  They all wish

ttmy husband the title of King because
tthe was deemed of insufficient rank--

tShe stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk.

</b>ttIt is a fine spot for a bench, is it

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttAye, ma'am.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttYes.

tA pause.

<b>ttttVICTORIA (CONT'D)
</b>ttI have some letters in the saddle bag. 
ttI wish to read them.

tBROWN walks up to her side, opens the saddle bag and hands
ther a bundle of letters held together with ribbon.

<b>ttttVICTORIA (CONT'D)
</b>ttI cannot read them like that.

tBROWN undoes the ribbon and tries again.  VICTORIA cuts in.

<b>ttttVICTORIA (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou will hand them to me as I require.

tBROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER
tSERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS
tprepare to serve soup.

tARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle
tnext to an empty seat.  A moment later, BROWN strides in.

tBut instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he
tgoes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself
tdown.  Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room
tstops and stares at him in silence.  BROWN fixes them with
ta look.

tAn elderly butler steps into the room and stares in
tamazement at BROWN.  A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET,
thurries up to intercede.

<b>ttttBERTIE'S VALET
</b>ttMr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits
ttthere.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttNot now he doesn't.  This is my place.

<b>ttttBERTIE'S VALET
</b>ttBy whose authority?

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttMy own.

tA little frisson of oh-my-gawdness.  BERTIE'S VALET stares
ticily at him.

<b>ttttBERTIE'S VALET
</b>ttThe order of seating at the Upper
ttServant's table is arranged personally
ttby the Queen herself.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttThat's a tautology lad.
ttt(unable to stop himself
ttt seriously explaining it)
ttIf you say the Queen arranges
ttsomething, you've no need to say she's
ttdone it personally.  That's
ttunderstood.

tBut as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't.  He
tstares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of
tthe under servants, who rushes over.  There is a hurried
texchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out.

tUnperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a
tsubstantial draft of whiskey.  He turns to the pretty
tassistant dresser, sitting to his right.

<b>ttttBROWN (CONT'D)
</b>ttAre you dresser to Her Majesty?

tShe blinks nervously at him.

<b>ttttASSISTANT DRESSER
</b>ttAssistant, sir, yes.

tBROWN tucks into his soup.  Everyone watches and waits.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttWhat's your name?

<b>ttttASSISTANT DRESSER
</b>ttMary Taylor, sir.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttHave I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?

<b>ttttASSISTANT DRESSER
</b>ttI hope to go up next year.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttYou wouldn't happen to know what the
ttQueen's reading for recreation, would
ttyou, Mary?

tThe assistant dresser thinks for a moment.

<b>ttttASSISTANT DRESSER
</b>ttLord Tennyson, sir?

tBROWN nods.  All conversation stops as the under servant
tbursts back in.  She halts at the door, looking blankly
tfrom Bertie's valet to the elderly butler.  A beat.  The
told man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the
ttable.

tBROWN looks up from his soup.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttAm I the only one eating?

tWith a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.

<b>tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tA few days later.  A morning "drawing room."  Standing
tround the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY
tCHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS
tALEXANDRA.  All are dressed against the icy wind that
twhistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits
tknitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat
tbuttoned up to the collar.  PONSONBY has stationed himself
topposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. 
tHe runs through the daily itinerary.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttLord Clarendon arrives, by invitation,
ttat eleven o'clock, followed at twelve
ttby a picnic in the grounds to
ttcelebrate Princess Alice's birthday. 
ttDispatches, as usual, at two.
ttt(finishes, then coughs)
ttThe Chancellor writes to say that, by
tthappy coincidence, he will be in Cowes
ttfor the weekend.  He asks if Your
ttMajesty might grant him an audience.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttHe thought, perhaps, Your Majesty
ttmight wish to be informed of the
ttlatest developments in government.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttNo.  I shall be out walking.

tA beat.  BERTIE watches closely now.  PONSONBY coughs
tagain, nervous.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttThen perhaps Your Majesty might
ttconsider it opportune if the Prince of
ttWales were to meet him on your behalf?

tVICTORIA stiffens.  She speaks without turning.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttOn no account.

tPONSONBY gives up.  Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up
tthe reins.

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttMama, I really do think it's time we
ttmade ourselves a little more ...
ttavailable.

tVICTORIA carries on knitting.

<b>ttttBERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>ttI think we must accept our position in
ttthe country is not entirely unrelated
ttto the continued absence of the
ttMonarchy from public life.
ttt(silence)
ttI thought perhaps we might consider a
ttsmall gesture of some kind?

tVICTORIA looks up sharply.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttGesture?

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttI thought, a dinner for our
ttambassadors perhaps?

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttt(cutting in firmly)
ttNo dinners, Bertie.
ttt(beat)
ttWhy are you dressed for outdoors?

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttIt's so infernally cold in here.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttCold is good--
ttt(calling across)
ttIs that not so, Dr. Jenner?!

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttI'm sorry, ma'am?

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttCold is good!

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttExcellent, ma'am, excellent.
ttt(trying his hand)
ttBut perhaps if her Majesty were to
ttconsider accompanying her new-found
ttphysical vigor with the benefits of
ttmental activity...

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttt(becoming very agitated)
ttWhy am I being lectured in this way?!

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttForgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way
ttdid I wish to suggest--

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttt(cutting across him)
ttI will not tolerate anybody lecturing
ttme about the responsibility of the
ttmonarchy....

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttMother....

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>tt... Least of all my son.  It was his
ttirresponsibility that drove my husband
ttto his grave.

tAn appalled silence.  With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs
tthe shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation
tin another direction.

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttIf it is inconvenient to Her Majesty,
ttthen perhaps she might consider
ttallowing the Prince of Wales to host--

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttI do believe they send so many boxes
ttto taunt me. 
ttDoctor Jenner writes to them to say
ttthat my nerves are in an extremely
ttfragile state and yet they continue to
tthound me with box after box after box
ttafter box after box!

tSilence.  VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out
tat the view.  Having recovered her composure, she turns to
taddress them all.

<b>ttttVICTORIA (CONT'D)
</b>ttI wish to take the Princesses for a
ttswim.

tFor a moment, nobody believes what they have heard.  She
tcontinues.

<b>ttttVICTORIA (CONT'D)
</b>ttThe turns I have been taking in the
ttgrounds have proved most beneficial to
ttme, and Brown thinks that salt water
ttwill do me good.

tBertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR
tJENNER exchange a worried look.

<b>tEXT. PRIVATE BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY
</b>
tThe doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen
tVICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck
tinto the freezing sea.  As she does so, the doors of the
tother machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise
tfollow her in.  Dignity does not allow them to shout out,
tbut their expressions of constipated agony are a picture.

tVICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little
tcircle.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttDon't potter, children.  Swim.

tHold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.

<b>tEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tHalf an hour later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY and
ttwo FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and
tonto her horse.  He glances at the stiff line of
thouseholders and mutters curtly to himself.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttYou could buy that lot for garden
ttornaments and still see change from
ttten guineas.

tThe household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has
toverheard and tries to suppress a smile. 
tAs she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose. 
tBROWN fastens it into the stirrups.

<b>ttttBROWN (CONT'D)
</b>ttLift your foot, woman.

tEveryone hears this.  VICTORIA obeys.  Taking the reins, he
tthen walks the QUEEN out of the courtyard.  As they vanish
tfrom site, we hear...

<b>ttttDISRAELI (O.S.)
</b>ttThis nation is fortunate in so much as
ttit is not governed by force...

<b>ttttttFADE TO BLACK.
</b>
<b>tCAPTION: "1866"
</b>
<b>ttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tINT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY
</b>
tThe speech continues as we follow the progress of a
tTomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the Tory back benches
tfrom knee to knee.  It is entitled, "Where is Britannia?"
tand shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak.

<b>ttttDISRAELI (O.S.)
</b>tt... but by a chain of traditions that
tthave been cherished from generation to
ttgeneration, because in them -- in our
tttraditions -- are embodied all the
ttlaws which have enabled us to create
ttthe greatest empire of modern times...

tDuring the above, the cartoon reaches the front benches and
tlands on the knees of the young, earnest STANLEY.  As he
tfrowns at the picture in front of him, DISRAELI winds up.

<b>ttttDISRAELI (CONT'D)
</b>tt... but, even though we have amassed
ttgreat capital and even though we have
ttestablished an industry with no
ttparallel in the world, yet all these
ttmighty creations are as nothing
ttcompared to the invisible customs that
ttshape our lives.  To those honorable
ttgentlemen of the opposition who seek
ttto destroy the essential elements of
ttthis country, I say let them remember:
ttEngland cannot begin again.

tDuring this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time. 
tHe is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like
tDickens on Slimfast.  He dresses almost dandyishly but
tspeaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance
tand cheek that is his key.  To cheers from his back
tbenchers, he sits.

tAs he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the
tLiberal benches.  GLADSTONE is different in almost every
trespect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.  They stare
tlevelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant
tsmile.

tSTANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap.

</b>ttHave you seen this?

<b>tINT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY

tA few minutes later, DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling
tdown the busy lobby corridor.  Throughout their talk, Tory
tback-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and
toffer their congratulations.

<b>ttttSTANLEY
</b>ttShould we take it seriously?

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttThe cartoon or Her Majesty's
ttabsenteeism?

<b>ttttSTANLEY
</b>ttWell, both.

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttThe question is, do we need her?

<b>ttttSTANLEY
</b>ttSurely, you're not suggesting we
ttdispense--

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttMy dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with
ttonly a handful of friends must respect

tThe pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts.

<b>ttttDISRAELI (CONT'D)
</b>ttGossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was

ttGranted, it wouldn't take much to

tThe next morning.  The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the

tBERTIE is in mid-plea.

</b>ttSurely it is for the gentlemen to
ttdecide when to stop...

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttIt is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It
ttshould be discouraged.

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttYes, but isn't midnight a little
ttexcessive?

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttIt is quite late enough.

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttBut mama, the room was built expressly
ttfor that purpose.  It has been a
ttsmoking-room by tradition ever since
ttfather --

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttt(cutting in angrily)
ttBrown's responsibilities are onerous
ttenough already.  He has far too much
ttto do without having to stay up all

ttThe smoking-room will be closed and

</b>ttMama...

</b>ttAnd that is my last word on the
ttmatter.

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttWell, I'm sorry, but I really do think
ttit's too much that the gentlemen of

ttservant.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttIt's the Queen's decision.

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttI beg your pardon?

ttMama...?

tBefore Bertie can continue, BROWN steps right into his
tface.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttI think you should go now.
ttt(beat)
ttYou've tired your mother enough.

tBERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak.  He glances at
this mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if
tshe has not heard.  BERTIE turns and storms away.

tJOHN BROWN is standing in the doorway of a small cottage
twatching, with amused detachment, as a middle-aged couple,
tMR and MRS GRANT, race about their tiny living room, trying
tdesperately to make it presentable for the Queen's sudden
tvisit.  They fling open the windows, slosh water on the
tfire, tidy up their two grubby BOYS, plump up the cushions,
tdump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves
tup, all in the space of a few seconds.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttThere's really no need for this.

</b>ttI'll not have her seeing it like it

</b>ttI hope they didn't go to any trouble,

</b>ttAh, well...

<b>tINT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY
</b>
tVICTORIA steps in to be greeted by all four GRANTS in one
tmilitary row, smoke still steaming off the fire.  BROWN
tstands behind her, barely able to contain himself.  But for
tVICTORIA, it is all she's ever known and so she takes it as
tperfectly normal.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttMr Grant.  How good it is to see you.

<b>ttttMR GRANT
</b>ttt(bowing deeply)
ttYour Majesty.

</b>ttt(bobbing in terror)
ttOh not so bad, ma'am.

</b>ttGood.  Oh and here are Douglas and

</b>ttt(still bobbing away)
ttGrowing all the time, ma'am.

tMR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a
tchair.

<b>ttttMR GRANT
</b>ttWill you sit, ma'am?

tFrom his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she
tsmiles as she is led to the chair.  She points to a picture
ton the wall and her good humour is infectious.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttI know that!  That's Cairn Lochan.  We

tA few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS,

</b>ttDon't be facetious, dear. Remember

</b>ttI see the Prince of Wales is here.

</b>ttt(ridiculously pleased with
ttt herself)
ttWhy is the Queen penny-wise and pound
ttfoolish?  Because she looks after the
ttBrowns and lets the sovereigns take

tA peal of naughty laughter.  Unseen, DISRAELI steps up.

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttAnd in your opinion?  Is she foolish?

tThe SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.

<b>ttttSOCIETY LADY 1
</b>ttWell I ... well, I mean to say, it's
tthardly right, is it?

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttSOCIETY LADY 1
</b>ttWell, the Queen and --
ttt(appalled whisper)
ttMr Brown.

tDISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead.

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttLa superstition met le monde entier en

</b>ttt(thick as shit)
ttI beg your pardon?

ttHas anybody seen this ... Mr Brown?

</b>ttHe is her personal servant, I believe.

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttHe would hardly make a very good

tBROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of
tQUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS
tGRANT nervously prattles on.

<b>ttttMRS GRANT
</b>tt... it's not my best china.  I mean,
ttit is my best china now, but the

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttOh, I'm so sorry ...

</b>ttOf course it was no-one on the Estate. 
ttMore likely one of the lads from

ttI'll fetch the salt.

tMRS GRANT scurries away.  VICTORIA immediately holds up the
tspoons to BROWN with a questioning look -- above or beside
tthe plate?  He nods her to the top and she quickly carries

</b>ttI don't think I've had that pleasure.

tDISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles
twith drink.  MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while

</b>ttNo doubt you've heard the rumors.

</b>ttI take no account of gossip, Your

</b>ttOf course.

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttI see.

<b>ttttBERTIE
</b>ttI would talk to her myself, but she

</b>ttA situation?

tThe moment he's gone, STANLEY steps up to DISRAELI's side.

</b>ttWhat did he want?

</b>ttTo know when he'll be king.

<b>tINT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

tVICTORIA, BROWN and the GRANTS are eating around a large
ttable.  Like a wife watching her husband, VICTORIA beams
tproudly at BROWN as he tells a story.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>tt... so Grant here and myself are
ttriding over Lochnagar and the rain's
ttpouring down in sheets and all we're
ttthinking about is getting home for a

ttme a shout and we chase them down
tttowards the loch until Grant has your

ttshouting and cursing at them, "Why are
ttyou poaching on Royal land?!"  And one
ttof the little fellas looks up at him
ttand says, "coz we've come up in the
ttworld."

tFor a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then
tBROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS
trelax.  Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too. 
tBeginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal
tquantities of whiskey all round.

tthrough the crowd in a state of high excitement.

</b>ttAye.

tVICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.  Before
twalking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says...

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttThank you, John.

tBROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.  As she straightens up,

tleads the horse back to the stables.

<b>tINT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe next day.

tQUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with
tgreat vim and vigor.  The tune is some quaint Scottish
tballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice,
talmost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE
tLEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand
tin a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. 
tIgnoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a
tquizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated.

tDISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards
toff, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician
tto his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This
tman is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his
tsmiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she
tbelts, until her children are drowned out completely.

tAnd then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops
tplaying and launches into one of her tirades.  The
tHOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back,
tbut DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttHow dare the Irish break with the

</b>ttOf course I understand your concern.

</b>ttIs that not enough?

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttIn so many ways ... and yet it is your

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttI never thought to be bullied by you,
ttMr Disraeli.  You, I thought,

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttForgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for
ttthe nation, only for myself.  As Prime
ttMinister I confess I miss your
ttpresence, but that is only an
ttexpression of my own selfish desires
ttand I should not burden you with it.

tThe Household waits.  Has he clawed himself back?  VICTORIA
tacknowledges his apology.  Her voice drops and she talks
tdirectly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart.

</b>ttI stay here because I am happy.

tBROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily.  He has
ta sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list. 
tLined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh,
tare five or six UPPER SERVANTS including the pretty

tFolding up the paper, BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and

ta clatter of cutlery and chat.

tARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched
tover his plate, pecking at his food.

tSomeone titters and ARCHIE looks up.  BERTIE'S VALET
tcoughs.  BROWN slowly lifts his head.  His eyes have the
tslightly unfocused look of too much drink.  It is clear to
tARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up.

tstairs.

<b>tEXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
</b>
tBROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed --
tto be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.  He is got up

</b>ttYou sent for me.

</b>ttWhy do you think I keep her here?

<b>ttttDISRAELI
</b>ttAh, but therein lies the paradox.  It
ttis her very isolation that encourages

tThe next day.

tBROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch.  The EQUERRIES

tVICTORIA trails her hand in the water, frowning at the
tsurface.  BROWN concentrates on the oars, slipping them
tcarefully through the water.

</b>ttI received a letter today from Mr

tFace turned from him, VICTORIA replies in a brittle voice.

</b>ttDo not presume to talk to your Queen
ttin that manner.

tA long silence.  BROWN watches her, but she will not look
tat him again.  Finally, she walks very slowly across the

tin with LADY ELY.

tA great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks

tout with her entourage in tow.  BROWN -- only just in time 
t- yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and
ttake her place.  She ignores him completely.

tBROWN slams the doors.  As he looks up, he sees his brother
tARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.  For a
tsecond the two brothers hold each other's gaze.  It's

taway under him.

tLADY ELY knocks.  The door is opened by a young UNDER
tSERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here
tin the servant's quarters.  VICTORIA walks in.

<b>tINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
tThe room has been cleared of bottles, but the thinness of
tthe life here shocks her deeply.  The cheap furniture, the
tanonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.

tHe is lying in bed, barely conscious.  After a moment, he
topens his eyes and stares at her.  She steps forward,
tsmiling nervously.

tHer voice is the old voice, between friends.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttYou should never have gone out in such
ttfoul weather.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttSomeone has to look after you.
ttt(pause)
ttIt could've been someone.  It was
ttbefore.

<b>ttttVICTORIA
</b>ttYes.  Yes it was.

tHe cannot speak.  It's difficult for her too, but she
tspeaks for him.

<b>ttttVICTORIA (CONT'D)
</b>ttMy Ministers are as impertinent as
ttever.  Dispatches are now so numerous,
ttthey come in a trunk.  Sometimes I do
ttbelieve they will never stop.  Endless
ttletters...
<b>tt 
</b>
tHer voice falters.  A pause

<b>ttttVICTORIA (CONT'D)
</b>ttI know I have not always been the
ttloyal friend you deserved, John.  And
ttyet here I am now, even now, feeling
ttdesperate at the thought of losing
ttyou.

tShe starts to cry.

<b>ttttBROWN
</b>ttDon't be silly, woman.

tHis old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls
therself together.  Seeing a bowl of water on the side
ttable, she steps across.  Carefully folding a cloth in
tfour, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face. 
tLeaning closer, she is about to touch his face when BROWN
tgestures protectively.

<b>ttttBROWN (CONT'D)
</b>ttNot too near.

<b>tINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
tA week later.  PONSONBY and JENNER stand at the window
toverlooking the grounds.

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttErysipelas.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttNot too protracted, I hope.

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttt(shakes his head)
ttA few days...
ttt(beat)
ttWhen he heard, the Prince of Wales
ttthrew the bust from the window of the
ttRoyal Gallery.  It took four hours to
ttgather the fragments.

tA beat.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttThe Queen wishes to publish an account
ttof him.

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttDear oh dear.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttWe think she can be dissuaded.
ttt(beat)
ttHave you had a glance at the diary?

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttQuite.
ttt(beat)
ttI think I'd best take it back.

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttOf course.

tHe brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it
tover to PONSONBY.  The two men move away from the window,
tto go their separate ways.  Daily business beckons.

<b>ttttJENNER (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhere did you find it by the way?

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttSome young page was boasting about
tthaving seen it.
ttt(beat)
ttLucky.

tJENNER nods.

<b>ttttJENNER
</b>ttWell, no rest for the wicked, Henry.

<b>ttttPONSONBY
</b>ttNo, indeed.

tThe two men head off in opposite directions down the
tcorridor.
