<b>tFADE IN:
</b><b> 
</b><b>1  tEXT. ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAY 
</b>
tIt is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of 
tBoston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things. 

tSHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark 
tyoung man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears 
tthe flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs 
tand a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band.

</b><b>5 tEXT. STREET - DAY 
</b>
tFOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. 
tHis smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without 
tstopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is 
tnot dissuaded.
<b> 
</b><b>6tINT. BARBER SHOP - DAY 
</b>
tShorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a 
tsurgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on 
ta table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, 
tthe eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing 
tbeing done just so, in time-honored fashion.

tHe slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar.
tHe adds water and makes a paste of the starch.

tBehind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is
 tgetting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON)
tone of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, 
tCHOLLY, is doing most of the talking.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHOLLY 
</b>ttAfter I hit the number that woman wasn't no good 
ttto me at all.
<b> 
</b>tThe men laugh.
<b> 
</b>tANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and 
tstrong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden 
tspoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as 
tfumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot.
<b> 
</b>tANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly 
tajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out. 

<b>ttttCHOLLY'S VOICE 
</b>ttShe says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond 
ttring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap 
ttblack sunovabitch to boot.

<b>ttttTOOMER 
</b>ttAnd when a black woman call you a cheap black 
ttsunovabitch you've been called a cheap black 
ttsunovabitch.
<b> 
</b>tCholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story. 

<b>ttttCHOLLY 
</b>ttWill you let me tell it?

tON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, 
tunfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of
 trubber gloves.

<b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttWhere's Homeboy?

tHe is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of 
tVaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts 
tof an exasperating child.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHOLLY 
</b>ttRed's in the head, man.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTOOMER 
</b>ttYou mean hiding in the head.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHOLLY 
</b>ttHey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you. 

tHis hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes 
tout, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes 
tand an expression of apprehension.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTOOMER 
</b>ttGonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, 
ttHomeboy?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHOLLY 
</b>ttMan, don't scare him more than he's scared 
ttalready. Ain't too bad...
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes 
thim with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding 
ta protective collar of paper.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHOLLY
</b>t...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her 
tcherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But 
tpretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, 
tHomeboy?
<b> 
</b><b>tCLOSE - MALCOLM 
</b>
tMalcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar. 

tShorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's 
tscalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered
 taround, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a 
tkind of execution.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHOLLY 
</b>ttGit his forehead and eyebrows.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttI know what I'm doing.
<b> 
</b>tShorty applies the Vaseline to that area.  Now he brings over the
tsteaming jar and places it nearby.

ttttSHORTY (contd)
 ttListen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging 
ttwhen I get through 'cause this shit can burn a 
tthole through cement.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHOLLY 
</b>ttHold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty 
tapplies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair.

<b>tCLOSE - MALCOLM 
</b>
<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttI thought you said it was gonna sting... this 
ttain't nothin'.
<b> 
</b>tFor a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries 
tto catch his breath: his head is on fire.
<b> 
</b>                    MALCOLM (contd)
ttYou motherfucker.  You're killing me. I'm 
ttburning up. My damn head is on fire.

tHe nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him.

tShorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the 
tcongolene into his hair. 

tMalcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a 
tbasin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the 
troom, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his 
thair.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttDon't fight me, man. Let me git it out.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he 
tfeels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces 
this head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting 
tMalcolm and the shop in the process.

</b><b>9  tINT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttWell, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn around.
<b> 
</b>tShorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit. He slips into 
tthe jacket...
<b> 
</b>tShoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ......
 tdons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully 
toutfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length 
tmirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain.
<b> 
</b><b>     ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttWell, all right, then.
<b> 
</b><b>   ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttWell, all reet, then.
<b> 
</b>tThe transformation is complete. The two laugh and slap hands. 

<b>10tEXT. ROXBURY STREET - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>tMalcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked,
tzoot-suited sharpies. Hometown boy has departed. And the CHICKS on the 
tstreet notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the 
tlighter-skinned, the more dominant. They walk imperiously past, fully 
taware of their impact.
<b> 
</b><b>tCLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>tFREEZE FRAME. He becomes a STILL.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttVOICE OF MALCOLM X

</b><b>10B tCLOSE - EARL LITTLE
</b>
tHe looks directly into the camera, wearing a Baptist Minister's robe.
<b> 
</b> ttttVOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)

<b>15 tINT. ROSELAND STATE BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b><b>tCLOSE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY
</b><b> 
</b>tThey both were posed for a picture. The music "FLYING HOME" is blaring 
tas LIONEL HAMPTON and his band is killing. The music is WILD, the
 tdancing is frantic, the clothes are OUT, and the crowd is predominately 
tBLACK, although there is a peppering of WHITES, especially white chicks.
 tAnd Malcolm is a little bug-eyed as he nudges Shorty, watching mixed 
tcouples on the floor. 

tA BOY in extreme zoot-suit flips him; a WHITE GIRL in long blond
thair wigs him. Malcolm is a little open-mouthed.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttA VOICE 
</b><b>ttSHOWTIME, SHOWTIME!
</b><b> 
</b><b>tANGLE - THE BALLROOM - NIGHT 
</b>
tPeople start moving off the floor, making room for the dancers. The 
tmusic begins to get faster and more furious. 

<b>tCLOSE - HAMPTON'S BAND - NIGHT 
</b>
tIt is a fast Lindy. People start clapping to the beat as they form a U 
taround the DANCERS, with the band at the open end.
<b> 
</b><b>16 tINT. THE DANCE FLOOR
</b><b> 
</b>tTWO COUPLES are on the floor, dancing wildly. They are quickly joined 
tby a half dozen OTHERS. These are the best dancers and constitute the 
tmain event of a Saturday night black dance. People crowd and push to 
tget better vantage points and the competition is under way.
<b> 
</b><b>tANGLE ON THE CROWD 
</b>
tIt is dominantly black, but there are some whites in the audience, 
tmostly women. One is SOPHIA, a spectacular blonde with a degree of
 trefinement, something of a thrill-seeker. Many of the men try to catch 
ther eye, but for the moment Sophia is just watching, looking for no one 
tin particular, but nonetheless looking.
<b> 
</b><b>tANGLE: - COUPLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR
</b><b> 
</b>tGetting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and 
tbounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is 
tgreeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites. 

<b>tWIDER SHOT
</b>
tThe music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more 
tremarkable quality. 

<b>tFOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLM 
</b>
tHe is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her. 
tHe makes his way through the watching audience. 

<b>tCLOSE - LAURA 
</b>
tShe is a fine chick, cool and beautiful. She smiles as she sees Malcolm 
tapproaching.

tTWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one 
tanother, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttCome on, baby, let's show 'em how.
<b> 
</b>tLaura smiles shyly; she's willing.
<b> 
</b>ttttMALCOLM (contd) 
ttYou better get out of them shoes, girl.
<b> 
</b>tLaura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of 
tsneakers.
<b> 
</b><b>17 tINT. THE DANCE FLOOR
</b><b> 
</b>tBecause of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a 
tmoment they are executing the most intricate steps of the "flapping 
teagle" and the "kangaroo." Malcolm starts boosting her over and around 
this hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect 
tpartner. She loves it.
<b> 
</b><b>tANGLE WITH THE CROWD
</b><b> 
</b>tSo does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: "Go,
 tman, go." "Hey, Red." "Mmmmmm ummm."
<b> 
</b><b>tANGLE: - SHORTY
</b><b> 
</b>tA big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and 
tshe takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around 
tlike a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has 
thad enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides.
<b> 
</b>tTWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners 
tnow; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp 
twaves over.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that 
tpeople are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in 
tparticular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to 
this steps.
<b> 
</b>tSeeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of 
tthe floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and 
tMalcolm go into a solo.
<b> 
</b><b>tANGLES
</b><b> 
</b>tThe crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other. 
tThe finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around 
tMalcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous 
tapplause of the audience. 

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO) 
</b>
tClapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration. 

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - SHORTY
</b><b> 
</b>tWaiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking 
this hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttHey, man, gimme some skin.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttShorty, this is Laura.
<b> 
</b>Laura is flushed and out of breath and joyous.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttLAURA
</b>tt'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttNow you come back.
<b>  
</b>tLaura laughs as she goes. She surely will be back.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttThat's a fine chick.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttFine as May wine.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttExcept she live on the hill and got a grandma.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttMake it too easy and it ain't no fun.
<b> 
</b>tThen his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a 
tsimple, direct gesture, "Want to dance?" Malcolm eyes Shorty and 
twordlessly glides into Sophia's arms.
<b> 
</b><b>tANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR
</b><b> 
</b>tImmediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the 
tcynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because 
tshe is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not 
tan obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine 
tsteps.
<b> 
</b>tTWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock 
this black world. 

<b>tCLOSE - MALCOLM 
</b>
tTrying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the 
tdancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for
 tit.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSOPHIA 
</b>ttWhy don't you take your little girl home, Red, 
ttand come on back?
<b> 
</b>tHe stops in his tracks. He can't believe it.
<b> 
</b>ttttSOPHIA (contd) 
ttJust walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you 
ttget back. 

tHe can only grin.

<b>18tEXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - ROXBURY - NIGHT 
</b>
tThe porch of a respectable house. Malcolm with Laura; he anxious to get 
taway.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI better not come in.
<b>  
</b><b>ttttLAURA
</b>ttI ain't stupid.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI mean it's late, baby.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttLAURA
</b>ttI know where you're going.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need 
ttmy rest.
<b> 
</b>tLaura walks to the door.
<b> 
</b>ttttMALCOLM (contd) 
ttBaby, I'll call you tomorrow.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttLAURA
</b>ttWhat for? I ain't white and I don't put out. 

tThe front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother, MRS. JOHNSON.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>tt'Night, Mrs. Johnson.
<b> 
</b>tHe runs down the porch steps.
<b> 
</b><b>19tINT. SOPHIA'S CAR - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>tThe lone light emits from the car radio which plays The Inkspots' "IF I
<b> tDIDN'T CARE."
</b><b> 
</b><b>tANGLE - SOPHIA
</b><b> 
</b>tSophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe 
twhite breasts. Malcolm's eyes are popping out of his head. NOTE: It's 
tvery unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might 
tsay Sophia was way ahead of her time.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSOPHIA
</b>ttMalcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen white 
ttbreasts like these?
<b> 
</b><b>tCLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>tHe shakes his head.
<b> 
</b>ttttSOPHIA (contd) 
ttPut your black hands on them.
<b> 
</b>tHe is paralyzed.

ttttSOPHIA (contd) 
ttPlease do as I say.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm mumbles something. He then kisses Sophia as if his black life 
tdepended on it and he commences to kill it.
<b> 
</b>ttttSOPHIA (contd) 
ttHey, baby.
<b> 
</b> tShe stops him for a moment, but he buries his head in her long neck.
<b> 
</b>ttttSOPHIA (contd) 
ttAm I the first white woman you've been with? 

tShe already knows the answer. He laughs.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttSheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSOPHIA
</b>tt...That isn't a whore?

tKnowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor. 

tA beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly. He raises his 
thand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSOPHIA
</b>ttThat's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's 
ttnot going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't 
ttrun.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttShhhh! I don't like women that talk.
<b> 
</b><b>tCLOSE - SOPHIA
</b>
tShe shrugs, then moves to embrace him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSOPHIA 
</b>ttWho wants to talk? 

tThe couple starts at it again. 

<b>19AtINT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>tOn the screen, Bogart and Cagney are blasting away the dirty, flat-
tfooted coppers with machine guns. It's one of those great Warner 
tBrothers gangster B movies, maybe _The Roaring Twenties_.
<b> 
</b><b>tANGLE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY
</b><b>  
</b>tMalcolm and Shorty sit, transfixed in their seats.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttDon't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttEat lead, coppers.
<b> 
</b><b>80 tEXT. BOSTON COMMONS - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>tA bright, sunny day, long shadows in the park. The Commons is almost 
tempty. Two improbable zoot-suited blacks race past trees, and run over 
tthe grass. Malcolm and Shorty are playing Cops and Robbers while 
tPASSERSBY stare.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttBang, bang. You're dead.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttNaw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for

<b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttI forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof 
ttvest.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttThe hell you are.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttI'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna 
ttbe Bogart sometimes.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttYou're too small to be Bogart.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSHORTY 
</b>ttI'm not too short to be Cagney.
<b> 
</b>tShorty shoots Malcolm from behind.
<b> 
</b>ttttSHORTY (contd) 
ttPow. Take that.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm acts as if he's been hit.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttAhhh! You got me, you dirty, filthy, rotten, 
ttstinking copper, only a low-down yellow rat 
ttbastard would shoot a man in the back.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm starts to stagger, this is a long drawn out Hollywood drawn-out 
tdeath a la Cagney death in _Public Enemy_. 

<b>tLOW ANGLE - MALCOLM

</b>
tEarl Little's face is in the same exact position as Malcolm's from the

tcloser and closer to the black man lying on the tracks.
<b> 
</b><b>27 tINT. A HEARING ROOM - DAY

</b>tA room, clinically empty; table, chair, and MR. HOLWAY. He is putting

</b>ttYou like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
<b>

</b><b> 
</b><b>FADE IN:
</b><b> 
</b><b>102tINT. THE CELL CORRIDOR - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>tIt is the afternoon lockup: about 3:30 P.M. The line of PRISONERS 
tstands in front of their cells, as two guards, WILKINS and BARNES, one 
twhite, one black, slowly walk past the P.M. check. 

tThe procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three 
ttimes a day: the black guard calls out the prisoner's name, the 
tprisoner answers with his number, then steps into his cell. Whereupon 
tthe white guard slams the door shut and locks it.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD WILKINS 
</b>ttJackson.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPRISONER 
</b><b>ttA 231549.
</b><b> 
</b>tDoor is slammed and gate locked. 

<b>tCLOSE - MALCOLM 
</b>
tEach time a gate is locked his tension increases. His face is a mask 
thiding his fury, violence and the hunger of an advanced junkie who has 
tnot had a fix in over a week.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD WILKINS 
</b>ttCrichlow.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSECOND PRISONER
</b><b>ttA 5991301.
</b><b> 
</b>tSame procedure.
<b> 
</b>tANGLE. SHOOTING PAST MALCOLM, FAVORING TWO OTHER PRISONERS. The guards 
tare approaching Malcolm's cell. Past Malcolm are two experienced 
tPRISONERS who have been watching Malcolm during the scene. They whisper 
tsurreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their 
tlips. One of the prisoners is PETE, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer --
tbeaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. The other is 
tBEMBRY, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately 
tthe gift of leadership. It is clear that Pete and others look up to him 
twith great respect.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPETE
</b>ttLooka Satan.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI see him.
<b> 
</b>tBembry's language is very unhip. He speaks carefully. He respects words 
tand he respects himself, something which sets him apart from all the 
tother prisoners.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPETE
</b>ttHe bout to bust.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttNo, he's not gonna bust. But he's not gonna fix 
tthis face to please them, neither.

tANGLE. The check-in has reached the man next to Malcolm.

<b>ttttGUARD WILKINS 
</b>ttHarrington.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttTHIRD PRISONER

<b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttHe's a new fish, Mr. Barnes. Give him a break.
<b> 
</b>tIt's a bold step by Bembry and the prisoners look over at him with
tadmiration. Barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to Bembry.

<b>ttttGUARD BARNES 
</b>tt0kay, I'll give him a break. Now state your 
ttnumber, Little.
<b> 
</b><b>tCLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI forgot it.
<b> 
</b><b> tCLOSE SHOT - BEMBRY
</b>
tShaking his head in anguish. He knows what's coming. 

tANGLE. Barnes makes a small gesture and Wilkins seizes Malcolm, 
tgrabbing his head and uniform at the same time. Stenciled on the chest 
tof his faded dungarees is Malcolm's number. The guard bends Malcolm's 
thead to the number, shoving the material in Malcolm's face.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD WILKINS 
</b>ttCan you read, boy? Thass your number.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD BARNES 
</b>ttNow say it.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI'm Malcolm Little, not no goddam number.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD WILKINS 
</b>ttOh, yes you is, baby; thass all you is.
<b> 
</b>tAnd slams Malcolm hard. He slumps to the floor.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD BARNES 
</b>ttTwo days in the hole. Take him.

</b>tWilkins drags Malcolm off as Barnes resumes the roll call.

</b><b>ttttttttJUMP CUT:

</b><b>103 tINT. A SOLITARY CELL - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>tOnly the faintest light comes into the hideous room, which consists of 
ta mattress and a slop bucket. If Malcolm were to stretch out his arms, 
the could touch both walls. He lies half on the stone floor, half on the
 tmattress.
<b> 
</b>tA clang as the heavy door is opened.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD CONE
</b>ttTime's up. Get on your feet.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm stands.
<b> 
</b>ttttGUARD CONE (contd) 
ttLittle, state your number.
<b> 
</b>tA beat as Malcolm stares at the man, refusing to answer.
<b> 
</b>ttttGUARD CONE (contd) 
ttYou just drew two more days.
<b> 
</b>tAnd slams the door shut. 

<b>104tINT. SOLITARY - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>tIt is almost pitch black. We can almost smell the stench of the room. 
tMalcolm sits stony-faced, his back against a wall. 

<b>ttttTRUSTEE'S VOICE
</b>ttWater.
<b> 
</b>tThe long spigot of a watering can is pushed through an opening in 
tthe cell door. Malcolm, animal-like, leaps at it and bends the spout, 
twrenching it off in his fury.

</b>ttPreacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin 
ttMary, both, and shove 'em.
<b> 
</b>tDoor slam.
<b> 
</b><b>107tINT. SOLITARY - NIGHT 
</b>
tMalcolm is alone at the bars: the hope of freedom filling his mind.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm pulls at the bars, tries to shake them in impotent fury. He 
tpounds the walls. Empty, sick, defeated, his nails scratching the 
twalls, he slides to the floor of the cell.

tIt is the low point of his life: nowhere to turn, nothing to hope for.
<b> 
</b><b>108  INT. SOLITARY - LATER
</b><b> 
</b>tGuard Cone is shaking him into consciousness.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD CONE
</b>ttAll right, Little. Get up.

</b>tMalcolm just about makes it. The guard is in half-focus. 

ttttGUARD CONE (contd) 
ttState your number.
<b> 
</b>tHe is beaten.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b><b>ttA 859912.
</b><b> 
</b>tA shower is heard.

<b>109 tINT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>tMalcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over his 
tbroken body. He lets it run and run, but it cannot really touch his 
tproblems. On a nearby bench are his clothes, his towel and the makings 
tfor a conk: lye, Vaseline, comb, etc.
<b> 
</b>tHe turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone. It's 
tBembry standing nearby. Malcolm turns away, trying to find solace in 
tthe water. He wants no part of the world or anyone, just to be left 
talone.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI know how you feel. Like you want to lay down 
ttand die.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding.
<b> 
</b>ttttBEMBRY (contd) 
ttI brought you something.
<b> 
</b>tHe puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to Malcolm's things. 
tMalcolm eyes him like a snake -- but the punishment has reduced him to 
tdeep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttWho the hell are you?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttPut it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttMan, what do you want?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttYou need something. It's not a reefer, but 
ttit'll help some.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttMan, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
<b> 
</b>tBut he steps out of the shower, fills a tin cup with water and empties 
tthe contents of the matchbox into it. And drinks it down quickly.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttSit down or it might knock you down.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm sits, toweling himself as the spice hits him. For the first, he 
tsmiles; this is the first relief he has tasted in prison. He at Bembry 
twonderingly, unable to figure him out.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttIf you ain't trying to punk me, what's your 
tthype?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI can show you how to get out of prison. And 
ttit's no hype.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttTalk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. 
ttYou got some more?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttThat's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttWhat did you give it to me for then?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>tt'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear 
ttme without it.
<b> 
</b>tThis is a new breed of cat; Malcolm has never met anyone like him. He 
teyes him closely, as he slips into his clothes.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttWhat in the hell are you talking about?
<b> 
</b>tHe begins to conk his hair, but is paying attention to what Bembry is 
tsaying.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI think you got more sense than any cat in this 
ttprison. How come you are such a fool?
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm looks over, piqued.
<b> 
</b>ttttBEMBRY (contd) 
ttNobody can bust out like Bogart does it, in the
tt movies. Because even if you get out, you are 
ttstill in prison.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm is putting the conk into his hair now.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttYou ain't lying.

<b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttWhen you go busting your fists against a stone 
ttwall, you're not using your brains. Cause 
ttthat's what the white man wants you to do. Look 
ttat you.
<b> 
</b>tThese last words are spoken sharply with disgust. Malcolm turns his 
thands massaging the conk into his hair.
<b> 
</b>ttttBEMBRY (contd) 
ttPutting all that poison in your hair.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttMan, you been locked up too long, everybody 
ttconks. All the cats.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttWhy? Why does everybody conk?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttCause I don't want to walk around with my head 
ttall nappy, looking like--
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttLike what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! 
ttWhy don't you want to look like what you are? 
ttWhat makes you ashamed of being black?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI ain't said I'm ashamed.
<b> 
</b>tHe turns the water on to wash out the conk -- which has begun to burn. 
tBembry restrains him, holding his arm.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttLeggo. I got to wash it out.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttLet it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
<b> 
</b>tBut it is burning now.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttMan, you better get off me.
<b> 
</b>tHe wrenches away from Bembry and puts his head in the water.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttSure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all 
ttthat poison into your hair, into your body -- 
tttrying to be white.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttMan, I don't want to hear all that.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI thought you was smart. But you just another 
ttone of them cats strutting down the avenue in 
ttyour clown suit with all that mess on you. Like 
tta monkey. And the white man sees you and he 
ttlaughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't 
ttwhite.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk. But some of what Bembry 
thas said disturbs him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttWho are you?
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm is completely humiliated. Bembry sees this and stops the 
tbarrage.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttThe question is, who are you? You are in the 
ttdarkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah 
ttMuhammad can bring you into the light.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttElijah who?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttElijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out 
ttof the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want 
ttis another fix. I thought you were smart.
<b> 
</b>tAnd he is gone. Malcolm stands looking after him, a long thoughtful 
tmoment. He is pulling the comb through his hair.
<b> 
</b><b>110 tINT. PRISON LICENSE SHOP - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>tPRISONERS are working on a beltline that stamps out and finishes 
tlicense plates. Bembry is on the stamping machines, working as he talks 
tto the other prisoners. Malcolm is painting the plates, a little 
tremoved from Bembry, but listening with interest. Barnes, with rifle, 
tidles by a window.
<b> 
</b>tA whistle sounds, ending the work shift. The inmates quickly file out 
tinto the yard. Bembry stays. Malcolm is half decided.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD BARNES 
</b>ttYou taking the yard?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI'm staying.
<b> 
</b>tBarnes gestures to Malcolm.

<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttWhat you sniffing around for? I told you I gave

<b>

</b>ttYou the only cat don't come on with that

<b>

</b>ttDon't con me. 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttWhat do you do with your time?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI read. I study. Because the first thing a

</b>tWE CAN READ the fine print of the definition:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDICTIONARY
</b>ttBlack, (blak), adj. Destitute of light, devoid 
ttof color, enveloped in darkness. Hence, utterly 
ttdismal or gloomy, as "the future looked black."
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM'S VOICE
</b>ttYou understand them words?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY'S VOICE 
</b>ttRead it.
<b> 
</b>tPULLBACK TO SHOW Bembry and Malcolm in a small PRISON LIBRARY. No one 
telse is in the book-lined room.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI can't make out that shit.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttSoiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, 
ttforbidding -- as a black day. Foully or 
ttoutrageously wicked, as black cruelty. 
ttIndicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.

</b>ttSee also blackmail, blackball, blackguard.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttHey, they's some shit, all right.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttNow look up "white."
<b> 
</b>tBembry turns the pages of the dictionary to "w."
<b> 
</b>ttttBEMBRY (contd) 
ttRead it.
<b> 
</b><b>tCLOSE SHOT - DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF "WHITE"
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM'S VOICE
</b>ttWhite (whit), adj. Of the color of pure snow; 
ttreflecting all the rays of the spectrum. The 
ttopposite of black, hence free from spot or 
ttblemish; innocent, pure, without evil intent, 
ttharmless. Honest, square-dealing, honorable.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm stumbles through the definition as well as he can. Bembry takes 
tover the reading, giving it ironic emphasis.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttThat's bullshit. That's a white man's book. 
ttAin't all these white man's books?
<b> 
</b><b>tSHOT - THE SHELVES OF BOOKS
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttThey sure ain't no black man's books in here.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttThen what you telling me to study in them for?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttYou got to learn everything the white man says 
ttand use it against him. The truth is laying 
ttthere if you smart and read behind their words. 
ttIt's buried there. You got to dig it out.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttMan, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking 
ttat?
<b> 
</b>tBembry smiles at Malcolm. He is a remarkable man who always takes 
tcareful measure of his listener. He never talks down to his audience; 
the talks to them. (A manner Malcolm later will adopt.) Bembry can talk
 tfunky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the 
tBible. Right now he goes into street talk.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI'll pull your coat, daddy. Cause lots of these 
ttcan't nobody read, be he black or white or a 
ttPh.D. with their suspenders dragging the ground 
ttwith degrees.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm laughs. He likes and admires the man. Then caught by a passage 
the does not understand:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttMan, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig 
tthalf the words.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttLook 'em up and and out what they mean.
<b>

</b>
tHe is reading on his bunk as Barnes walks by. The lights in the cell go 
tout. Malcolm looks up, annoyed at being interrupted. He shifts his 
tposition to the floor of the cell so that he can catch the dim light 
tcoming from the corridor and goes on with his reading. 

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - THE BOOK 
</b>
tMalcolm is studying the dictionary, the last of the "a's": the words
tazimuth, Azores, Aztec, azure, etc. He reads a word, then holds his 
thand over the printed definition to test himself, half-mouthing its 
tmeaning. Malcolm is also copying the dictionary in a school book word 
tfor word.
<b> 
</b><b>114 tINT. LIBRARY - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>tThere are several books on the desk before Malcolm. WE SEE their 
ttitles: W.E.B. DuBois's _The Soul of Black Folks_, Carter G. Woodson's 
t_Journal of Negro History_, Durant's _Story of Philosophy_, H.G. 
tWells's _Outline of History_, Spinoza, Thoreau, etc.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD BARNES'S VOICE
</b>ttClosing. Knock it off.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm is surprised the time has gone so fast. He gathers up his books 
twith care. He cherishes them, putting them back on the shelf carefully.

</b><b>ttttGUARD BARNES
</b>ttYou studying to be the first colored 
ttPresident of the States?
<b>

</b>tThe machines are idle; no one is in the room but Malcolm. He starts 
tto reach inside his jacket when Barnes sticks his head in.

</b><b>ttttGUARD BARNES 
</b>ttYou taking the yard or not?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI'm staying.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGUARD BARNES 
</b>ttThen give me a butt.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm takes out a half-filled pack of cigarettes, about to offer one, 
tthen pauses. Malcolm hands him the pack of cigarettes.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttTake 'em. I don't smoke no more.
<b> 
</b>tHe takes the pack happily and goes. Malcolm reaches into his jacket 
tagain, takes out a book. WE SEE its title: Mahatma Gandhi's _My 
tStruggle_. He sits next to the license press to read.
<b> 
</b><b>116tEXT. THE PRISON YARD - DAY 
</b>
tA baseball game is in progress. A BLACK TEAM is playing a WHITE ONE. 
tMost of the CONVICTS are watching the game; partisanship at every 
tpitch. A base hit gets a big reaction. 

<b>tANGLE - MALCOLM AND BEMBRY 
</b>
tThey are out along the right field wall. They walk throughout the scene.

tANGLE - The ball is hit over the fence for a home run. There is a big 
tcheer from the black prisoners. Pete, the batter, trots proudly around 
tthe bases.
<b>  
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttOle Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay 
ttin there with the wood.

</b>tTWO-SHOT - Malcolm still watching the game.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttYou pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttThe first men on earth were black. They ruled 
ttand there was not one white face anywhere. But 
ttthey teach us that we lived in caves and swung 
ttfrom trees. Black men were never like that.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm is listening to Bembry's intent statement.
<b> 
</b>ttttBEMBRY (contd) 
ttWe were a race of kings when the white men went 
ttaround on all fours.
<b> 
</b>tThere is a crack of the bat and Malcolm turns to watch another base 
thit, by a black convict, stir the crowd.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttThis a helluva game. Somethin's going on.
<b> 
</b>tHe sees a black convict, CHUCK, nearby and calls over:

</b>ttA black man playing big league ball is 
ttsomething.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI told you to go behind the words and dig out 
ttthe truth. They let us sing and dance and

ttmajors. That don't cancel out the greatest

ttlocked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- 
ttbroke up our families, tortured us, cut us off 
ttfrom our language, our religion, our history.

</b>tMalcolm is startled; answers like a boy.

tMalcolm cannot answer because he truly does not know.
<b> 
</b>tA ball is hit. Malcolm watches its flight but his face is fixed 
tsomewhere between understanding and anger: it is the face of the future

</b><b> 
</b>tThe rays of the sun come through bars that cut across Malcolm and 
tBembry's face.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttAllah has sent us a prophet, a black man named 
ttElijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm--
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttThen the devil is white.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI knew you'd hear me. The white man is the 
ttdevil. All white men are devils.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI sure met some.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttNo. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white 
ttman is a devil." He teaches us that the white 
ttman is the devil. All white men.

tMalcolm and Bembry standing close together. The feeling is of someone 
ttaking communion: with Bembry the minister and Malcolm the communicant. 
tTheir voices are little more than whispers.
<b>

</b>ttThe body is a holy repository.

</b>ttI will not touch the white man's poison: his

<b>

</b>ttA Muslim must be strikingly upright. 
ttOutstanding. So those in the darkness can see 
ttthe power of the light.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm lifts his head.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI will do it.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttBut the key to Islam is submission. That is why 
tttwice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of 
ttHolies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
<b> 
</b>tBembry kneels in a praying position. Malcolm stands.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI can't.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttFor evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, 
ttimplore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing 
tton earth--

</b>ttI want to, Bembry, but I can't.

</b>ttYeah. When I was picking a lock to rob 
ttsomebody's house.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttTell Him that.
<b>

</b>ttI don't know how.

tMalcolm holds a letter in his hand. He reads it carefully. He has read 
tit several times before.

ttme, a nobody, a junkie, a pimp and a convict.

</b>ttI have come to give you something which can 
ttnever be taken from you: I bring you a sense of 
ttyour own worth, the worth of one human being. 
ttThe knowledge of self.
<b> 
</b>tThe room becomes transformed. It is suddenly suffused with light. And 
tstanding in the cell with Malcolm is ELIJAH MUHAMMAD. He has 
tmaterialized, but he can be seen through. He is MALCOLM'S 
<b>tHALLUCINATION.
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttVOICE OF MALCOLM X 
</b>ttIt was like a blinding light and I became aware 
ttthat he was in the room with me. He wore a dark 
ttsuit and on his face I saw a pain so old and 
ttdeep and black I could scarcely look at him. I 
ttknew I was not dreaming. He was there.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttELIJAH 
</b>ttI tell you that the most dangerous creation of 
ttany society in the world is the man with 
ttnothing to lose. You do not need ten such men 
ttto change the world. One will do. The Earth 
ttbelongs to us, the Black man and whatever is 
ttaround it, and on it and in it. Praises are 
ttdue to him forever for bringing to us again, 
ttour self and our property, the UNIVERSE OF SUN,

</b>ttYou've been talking about the disciples. What

</b>ttThey were Hebrew, weren't they?

</b>tPAN CONTINUES to take in ANOTHER SPEAKER, a few feet away. WE SEE the

</b>tThe headquarters itself shows the progress Malcolm has made. It is

tMalcolm stands at a podium.

 tArchie sits up from his bed and stares. He tries to bring back some of
this old juice, tries to stand up.

</b>ttThat really you, Red?

tThe contrast is shocking: Malcolm tall and straight; Archie ruined.

</b>ttYou saved my life, Archie. Running me out of 
ttHarlem. When I think how close we came to 
ttgunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.

tnow selling their bodies. He passes Laura, she has been turned totally

tthough.

tthouseholds?--
<b> 
</b><b>136 tINT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>tMalcolm is addressing a HUGE AUDIENCE. His tone is more intense, more 
tpersonal than before, because of his recent encounters. In the 
taudience, sitting with Bembry, is BETTY, a lovely dark-skinned woman. 
tHer interest in Malcolm (true, also, for most of the other unmarried 
tsisters) is more than religious.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>tt--and what has the white devil made of them: 
ttdead souls. Oh, my he has no conscience. He 
ttshould fall on his knees and say, "My kind 
ttcommits history's greatest crime against your 
ttkind every day of your life." But does he? No. 
ttHe scorns you, splits your head with his 
ttnightstick and calls you nigger. If you've had 
ttit, then stand up and come forward. If not us, 
ttthen who? If not now, then when?
<b> 
</b><b>tANGLE - THE AUDIENCE
</b><b> 
</b>tMany stand, some walk toward the podium speaking his name: "I'm with 
tyou, Brother Malcolm," "Praise Allah," "Me, Brother Malcolm."
<b>  
</b>tThere is applause; some of the audience get to their feet -- Malcolm 
tacknowledges their approval, trying to quiet them, but caught up in the
 theady excitement of leadership.
<b>

</b><b> 
</b>tBoth are moved by Malcolm's performances.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBETTY
</b>ttt(whispering) 
ttHe ought to try to make it a little easier, 
ttBrother Bembry.

</b>ttWhy don't you try telling him that, Sister 
ttBetty?
<b> 
</b><b>137tINT. A LARGE ANTEROOM IN TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>tThe Muslim movement has grown enormously. The activity in this 
tanteroom, leading to other rooms off it, shows that. Betty and Bembry 
tstand before a Directory announcing activities in the Temple: MONDAY - 
tFruit of Islam Meeting; TUESDAY - Unity Night; WEDNESDAY - Student 
tEnrollment; THURSDAY - Muslim Girls Training; FRIDAY - General
tCivilization Class; SATURDAY - Swahili, etc.
<b> 
</b>tA stir of people and activity as Malcolm enters the anteroom. He 
texcuses himself from a group of MUSLIMS, making his way toward Bembry.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttt(little out of breath) 
ttBrother Bembry, can we fix it so our 
ttloudspeaker is heard on the street?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEMBRY 
</b>ttI'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister 
ttBetty.
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm nods at her; she nods in return.
<b> 
</b>ttttBEMBRY (contd) 
ttThe Sister lectures our Muslim women in hygiene 
ttand diet.

</b>tMalcolm mutters "very good," but his mind is clearly on a million other 
tdetails.

</b>ttttBEMBRY (contd) 
ttThe Sister stresses care of the body and 
ttregular eating habits.

</b>tMalcolm is still distracted.
<b>

</b>ttThe Sister wonders if the Brother knows what 
ttHarriet Tubman did between taking souls to the 
ttPromised Land?
<b> 
</b>tMalcolm is stopped. He looks at Betty.
<b>

</b>ttWhat?
<b>

</b>ttShe ate.

</b>tMalcolm laughs.

ttttBETTY (contd)

<b> 
</b><b>tCLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttWomen talk too much. To tell a woman not to 
tttalk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a

</b>ttNo. We are not Catholic priests. We do not 
ttpractice celibacy. If a woman is the right 
ttheight for a man, the right complexion, if her

ttConsidering today's standards of animal raising 
ttand curing meats, I don't fully understand the 
ttrestriction on pork.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttLet me explain. No. I'll do better than that. 
ttI'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's

<b> 
</b><b>ttttBETTY'S VOICE:

ttscientific.
<b> 
</b><b>139 tINT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY

<b>

<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttSo it is not a matter of the breeding

</b>ttThat's something I haven't done in fifteen years.

ttaccusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of 
ttteaching black supremacy when he tries to 
ttuplift the mentality, the social, and economic 
ttcondition of black people in this country. And 
ttthe Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting 
ttthe black people economically, civilly, and 
ttotherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the 
ttHonorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic 
ttsimply because he teaches our people to go into

ttthe economic leadership in our own community. 
ttThe black people in this country have been the 
ttvictims of violence at the hands of the white 
ttman for 400 years, and following the ignorant 
ttNegro preachers, we have thought that it was 
ttGod-like to turn the other cheek to the brute 
ttthat was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they 
ttuse to put on a white sheet and use a

ttjust as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to 
ttkeep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds 
ttor resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them 
ttto love their enemy or pray for those who use

ttMuhammad is showing black people that just as

ttgood and he loved the master. Yeah, he loved 
tthim more than the master loved himself. If the

tHAWKERS selling _The Messenger_, faces of Fruit of Islam near the

tSidney notices this from his father, but makes no comment.

<b>ttttMALCOLM/HIS VOICE 
</b>ttThe Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that 
ttGod is now about to establish a kingdom on this 
ttearth based on brotherhood and 

<b>tt[...]
</b>
ttagainst peace, his history on this earth has 
ttproved that. Nowhere in history has he been 
ttbrotherly toward anyone. The only time he has 
ttbeen brotherly toward you is when he can use 
ttyou, when he can exploit you, when he can 
ttoppress you, when you will submit to him. And 
ttsince his own history makes him unqualified to 
ttbe an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of 
ttbrotherhood, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad 
ttteaches us that God is about to eliminate that 
ttparticular race from this earth. So since they 
ttare due for elimination, we don't want to be 
ttwith them.

</b>ttttMALCOLM (contd) 
ttIf the so-called Negro were American citizens

ttwouldn't have a race problem. If the 13th, 
tt14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution 
ttwas authentic, you wouldn't have a race 
ttproblem. If the Supreme Court desegregation 
ttdecision was authentic, you wouldn't have a

ttNegro leaders have been telling the white man 
tteverything is all right, everything is under 
ttcontrol. And they've been telling the white man 
ttthat Mr. Muhammad is wrong, don't listen to 
tthim. But everything Mr. Muhammad has been 
ttsaying is going to come to pass is now coming 
ttto pass and now the Negro leaders are standing

ttand spokesmen for black people. Anytime you put 
tttoo many sparks around a powder keg, the thing 
ttis going to explode and if the thing that 
ttexplodes is still inside the house, then the 
tthouse will be destroyed. So the Honorable 
ttElijah Muhammad is telling the white man get 
ttthis powder keg out of your house, let the 
ttblack people in this country separate from him 
ttwhile there's still time. And if the black man 
ttis allowed to separate and go on onto some land 
ttof his own, where he can solve his problems,

ttyear on the racial front, and because I myself 
ttintend to be very active in every phase of the 
ttAmerican Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I 
tthave called this press conference, this 
ttmorning in order to clarify my own position in 
ttthe struggle -- especially in regards to 
ttpolitics and nonviolence. In the past I thought 
ttthe thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable 
ttElijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on 
ttI speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. 
ttInternal differences within the Nation of Islam 
ttforced me out of it. I did not leave of my own 
ttfree will. But now that it has happened, I 
ttintend to make the most of it. Now that I have 
ttmore independence of action, I intend to use a 
ttmore flexible approach toward working with 
ttothers to get a solution to this problem. I do 
ttnot pretend to be a divine man, but I do 
ttbelieve in divine guidance, divine power, and 
ttin the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not 
tteducated, nor am I an expert in any particular 
ttfield, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my 
ttcredentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro 
ttleaders or organizations. We must find a common 
ttsolution, to a common problem. I am going to 
ttorganize and head a new mosque in New York 
ttCity, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This 
ttgives us a religious base, and the spiritual 
ttforce necessary to rid our people of the vices 
ttthat destroy the moral fiber of our community. 
ttOur political philosophy will be black 
ttnationalism. Our economic and social philosophy 
ttwill be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, 
ttInc. will remain wide open for ideas and 
ttfinancial aid from all quarters. Whites can 
tthelp us, but they can't join us. There can be 
ttno black-white unity until there is first some 
ttblack unity.

</b>ttLet's begin.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttREPORTER #1 
</b>ttMalcolm, you said on your trip abroad you 
ttsensed a feeling of great brotherhood.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttAs I recall, I pointed out that while I was in 
ttMecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the 
ttbrotherhood that existed at all levels among 
ttall people, all colors who had accepted the 
ttreligion of Islam. I pointed out that what it 
tthad done, Islam, for those people despite their 
ttcomplexion differences, that it would probably 
ttdo America well to study the religion of Islam 
ttand perhaps it could drive some of the racism 
ttfrom this society. Muslims look upon themselves 
ttas human beings, as part of the human family 
ttand therefore look upon all other segments of 
ttthe human family as part of that same family. 
ttToday my friends are black, brown, red, yellow 
ttand white.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttREPORTER #8 
</b>ttMalcolm, are you prepared to go to the United

ttbrought against the United States for its 
tttreatment of the American Negroes?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttOh yes.

tThe AUDIENCE applauds.
<b> 
</b>ttttMALCOLM (contd) 
ttThe audience will have to be quiet. Yes, as I 
ttpointed out that during my trip that nations, 
ttAfrican nations, Asian, Latin nations look very 
tthypocritical when they stand up in the UN 
ttcondemning South Africa and saying nothing 
ttabout the racist practices that are manifested 
tteveryday against Negroes in this society. I 
ttwould be not a man if I didn't do so. I 
ttwouldn't be a man.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttREPORTER #3 
</b>ttAre you prepared to work with some of the

tt organizations?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttCertainly, we will work with any groups, 
ttorganizations or leaders in any way, as long as 
ttit's genuinely designed to get results.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttREPORTER #1 
</b>ttDoes the new beard have any religious 
ttsignificance?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttNo, not particularly. But I do think that you 
ttwill And black people in America, as they 
ttstrive to throw off the shackles of mental 
ttcolonialism, will also probably reflect an 
tteffort to throw off the shackles of cultural 
ttcolonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect 
ttdesires of their own with standards of their 
ttown.
<b> 
</b><b>                   tREPORTER #2 
</b>ttOne of your more controversial remarks was a 
ttcall for black people to get rifles and form 
ttrifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor 
ttthat for self-defense?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttI don't see why that should be controversial. I 
ttthink that if white people found themselves 
ttvictim of the same kind of brutality that black 
ttpeople in this country face, and they saw that 
ttthe government was either unwilling or unable 
ttto protect them, that the intelligence on the 
ttpart of the whites would make them get some 
ttrifles and protect themselves.

</b>ttBrother Minister, what is wrong?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM 
</b>ttThe way I feel, I ought not to go out there 
tttoday. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this 
tttension by telling the black man not to fight 
tthimself -- that's all a part of the white man's 
ttbig maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst 
ttourselves, against each other. I'm not 
ttfighting anyone, that's not what we're here 
ttfor.

<b> 
</b><b>ttttOSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE 
</b>ttHere at this final hour, in this quiet place, 
ttHarlem has come to bid farewell to one of its 
ttbrightest hopes, extinguished now and gone from 
ttus forever.
<b> 
</b>200C tDOLLY SHOT of the long line of people outside the funeral parlor, 
twaiting to see Malcolm's body, where it lies before burial.
<b> 
</b>ttttOSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE: (contd) 
ttFor Harlem is where he worked, and where he 
ttstruggled and fought. His home of homes, where 
tthis heart was and where his people are. And it 
ttis therefore most fitting that we meet once 
ttagain in Harlem to share these last moments 
ttwith him. For Harlem has ever been gracious to 
ttthose who loved her, have fought for her and 
ttdefended her honor even to death. It is not in 
ttthe memory of man that this beleaguered, 
ttunfortunate but nonetheless proud community has 
ttfound a braver, more gallant young champion 
ttthan this Afro-American who lies before us 
ttunconquered still. Many will ask what Harlem 
ttfinds to honor in this stormy, controversial 
ttand bold young captain and we will smile and we 
ttwill answer and say unto them:
<b> 
</b><b>2OOD  SHOTS - FACES OF HARLEM - PRESENT DAY - THE 90'S
</b><b> 
</b>tOrdinary PEOPLE in ordinary pursuits of life, BLACK PEOPLE still 
tstruggling to stay afloat in a racist WHITE AMERICA that does not have 
ttheir best interests at hand -- 8 years of Reagan and now at least 4 
tyears of Bush.
<b> 
</b>ttttOSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd) 
ttDid you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you 
tthave him smile at you? Did you ever listen to 
tthim? Did he ever really do a mean thing? Was he 
ttever associated with violence or any public 
ttdisturbance?
