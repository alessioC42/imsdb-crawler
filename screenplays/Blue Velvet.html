Blue skies. PAN SLOWLY DOWN to clean white picket fence, with beautiful 
red roses in front of it. Birds CHIRP in the distance. A faint sprinkler 
SOUND is heard. Very sweet MUSIC is playing.

A bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street.

We MOVE IN to see the happy face of a FIREMAN.

Yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze.

<b>tttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>6. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY
</b>
The same white picket fence with roses in front of it. 

PANNING SLOWLY now away from the roses down to the rich green lawn 
and over to the sprinkler which goes around and around shooting water 
droplets sparkling in the light. 

This is slightly SLOW MOTION and DREAMY.

<b>tttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>7. EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY
</b>
CLOSER ON WATER DROPLETS. The water droplets are somewhat abstracted 
as they dance in the light.

PAN DOWN now to the green grass, traveling along the grass. 

The MUSIC becomes fainter as we MOVE SUDDENLY under the grass, now as 
if in a dark forest. 

<b>SLOWLY MOVING THROUGH. 
</b>
The grass is like great timbers.

It is GETTING DARKER and ominous SOUNDS come up as we discover black 
insects crawling and scratching in the darkness.

<b>FADE TO:
</b>
<b>8. EXT. BEAUMONT'S FRONT LAWN - DAY
</b>
MR. BEAUMONT is watering flowers and grass with the hose.

He is dressed in khaki trousers, canvas shoes, old white shirt, straw 
hat and dark glasses.

<b>CLOSE - MR. BEAUMONT
</b>
watches his watering, then looks up.

The sky and the neighborhood are reflected in his dark glasses.  He 
moves his false teeth around a little in his mouth, jutting out his chin 
in the process.  He's thinking about who knows what.

He looks back down at his lawn.

<b>CLOSEUP - WATER ON GRASS
</b>
The water hits the grass and mats it down.

<b>WIDER - MR. BEAUMONT
</b>
moves the hose over a bush and gets a kink in it.

Water stops coming out of the nozzle and there is a LOUD HISSING NOISE 
of water under pressure.

<b>CLOSEUP - KINK IN HOSE
</b>
Loud HISSING NOISE.

Mr. Beaumont goes around the bush and is undoing the kink when he is 
suddenly hit with a tremendous seizure.

<b>CLOSEUP - MR. BEAUMONT
</b>He's doubling over and falls to the ground.  He continues to grasp onto 
the hose.

Water shoots crazily onto the driveway and his car.

Mr. Beaumont seems to be in tremendous pain. 

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>9. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Mrs. Beaumont is curled up on the couch, smoking a cigarette and watching 
T.V.  It's a daytime soap.

<b>CLOSEUP - MRS. BEAUMONT
</b>
Takes a big drag of her cigarette and luxuriously french inhales a huge 
quantity of blue smoke.  She's enjoying her show.

</b>
His teeth are crooked in his mouth now as he tries to scream.

No sound is coming out.

WATER SOUND is loud.

<b>WIDER - MR. BEAUMONT
</b>
Water is still spraying out over the driveway and onto the car and into 
the yard beyond.

A small boy, GREGG, appears wearing only white underpants and a white 
t-shirt.  He holds a large red popsicle.

Gregg waddles around looking at the crazy water show.  He holds his hand 
out to get it wet in the spray.  This makes him screw up his face in a 
laugh.

He waddles over and looks at Mr. Beaumont on the ground.

Mr. Beaumont seems to be worse now, unconscious, but still gripping the 
hose tightly. His clothes are sopping wet.

<b>11. EXT. GREGG'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Screen window of Gregg's house. Gregg's mother calls out but remains 
looking at a bowl she is holding in her hands.

She then turns to look out.

TRAVELING along sidewalk, bushes, to lighted windows of an auditorium. 
MUSIC is heard.

<b>14. INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>
A dance is going on.  Sixties MUSIC plays, performed by a live band on 
stage.  College kids dance.

A COLLEGE BOY enters the auditorium, urgently looking for someone.  He 
quickly approaches a GIRL.

<b>tttttCOLLEGE BOY
</b>tttLouise? Where's Jeffrey? His mother's on
tttthe phone - it's an emergency.

tttwaiting - let's go find him.

<b>15. INT. JANITOR'S QUARTERS - COLLEGE - NIGHT
</b>
We MOVE INTO the face of JEFFREY. He is hiding behind a furnace.  He is 
fascinated by a sight beyond in the darkness of this basement room.

He sees a male student trying to rape his girlfriend.  She is crying and 
telling him to stop but the boy keeps forcing her down toward the ground. 
forcing her clothes off her.  Jeffrey at this point hears his name being 
called.  Each time he hears his name the caller is closer.  The boy is now
hurting the girl.  Before Jeffrey leaves the furnace room he yells out:

<b>ttttt JEFFREY
</b>tttHey, shit head. Leave her alone. Don't 
tttforce girls!

The couple looks up but cannot see Jeffrey.  The boy is scared and releases
the girl who promptly pulls farther away, crying.

Jeffrey leaves the furnace room.

<b>16. INT. HALLWAY - COLLEGE - NIGHT
</b>
Louise and the college student see him and move quickly toward him.


<b>tttt     COLLEGE BOY
</b>tttJeffrey, your mother's on the phone. It's

As Jeffrey moves quickly toward the telephone.

The phone dangles on its cord in the foreground as Jeffrey moves toward 
it in the background.  Louise slowly follows Jeffrey, but stays in back 
of him.  Jeffrey picks up the phone.

Jeffrey comes walking out of the airport, where his Mother and AUNT 
BARBARA, who is a very absent-minded little woman with very thick glasses, 
are waiting for him.  

They are parked illegally and another car is honking at them.  Their 
trunk is open in anticipation of Jeffrey's things.  They are waving and 
yelling at Jeffrey to get his attention.  He finally joins them and kisses 
his Mother, then his Aunt.

They get in the car.  Aunt Barbara is driving.  She is not a good driver 
and makes Jeffrey nervous.  He watches her every move from the back seat.

They drive on surface streets.  Many gas stations, traffic lights, bars.

<b>tttt    MRS. BEAUMONT
</b>tttHe had a cerebral hemorrhage and they think
tttthere's some sort of clot, or tumor, or 
tttsomething in there. They're doing all sorts

tttmay have to stay in two weeks now, at least.

All he can see are curtains surrounding a bed and stacks of medical 
machinery.  Doctor Gynde comes out from behind the curtains and walks to 
Jeffrey.

</b>tttHello Jeffrey.

<b>ttttt JEFFREY
</b>tttHello, Doctor Gynde. How is he?

<b>tttttDR. GYNDE
</b>tttHe's fighting hard. Jeffrey. it's very

tttbe very painful for him. sit close. you do
tttthe talking and moving. He knows you're 
ttthere. He became very emotional. I don't 
tttthink he likes the idea of you seeing him
tttlike this.

Nurse Cindy goes to the bed.  She begins to pull the curtains back 
revealing Mr. Beaumont.

tttMr. Beaumont! Your son is here to visit you.

Then we see Mr. Beaumont.  He has numerous tubes and needles going into 
different parts of him.  A stainless steel device holds his head perfectly
still.  Nurse Cindy picks up a tray and leaves.

tttHi Dad.

Jeffrey goes to him and puts out his hand to shake his father's hand but 
remembers his father cannot move.  Jeffrey pats him on the shoulder.

Tears well up in Mr. Beaumont's eyes.  Before Jeffrey can stop him he 
reaches for Jeffrey's hand, then struggling against tremendous pain he 
manages to form words.

<b>tttt     MR. BEAUMONT
</b>ttt (more plainly but under strain)
tttGood to see you, son.

tttIt's good to see you, Dad.

Jeffrey squeezes his father's hand.

<b>35. EXT. VACANT FIELD - DAY
</b>
Jeffrey is walking down a dirt road on his way home.  He kicks up little 
clouds of dust as he walks.  He has some time to think about things. He 
sees a green bottle in the distance. He gathers up a few more rocks and 
pitches them one by one at the bottle.  He misses.

He looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some
tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange.

He looks closer.  It is a HUMAN EAR, covered with crawling ants.

Jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around.  All he sees are houses 
- some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene.  No one seems to be around -
No one seems to be watching him.

He looks again at the ear.

We are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it.
There is dried blood on part of it.

Jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto 
it.  Again, he stands up and looks around.

IN THE DISTANCE, a MAN goes into the back door of a house.  Nothing more.

Jeffery hurries off, carrying the bag with the ear in it.

</b>tttYeah. I've got it here in this bag. I
tttthought I should bring it to you.

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttYep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.

Jeffrey opens the bag and lets Detective Williams look inside.

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS

tttThat sure looks like a human ear, doesn't

tttNow if you'd found a jaw or let's say, a

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhat can you tell about the person from the
tttear?

Aunt Barbara and Mrs. Beaumont continue watching the television.

On T.V. we see a man's shoes.  He is sneaking slowly up some stairs.

Jeffrey walks along the dark streets.  The same sombre MUSIC plays low 
and slow.

Some of the houses have a few lights on, some are dark.  Some windows have 
a slow uneven blue flashing light, indicating the television is on inside.

Jeffrey continues walking through the night.  In the trees, the shadows 
continuously re-arrange themselves in mysterious, sometimes frightening 
patterns.

<b>46. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey finally comes to the house he's been looking for.

He goes up the front walk.  Now, at the last minute, he feels a little 
foolish and has second thoughts about knocking on the door.

He looks in a window.  Inside, he sees a nicely-lit living room.  
He goes ahead and knocks.  A very pleasant-looking middle class WOMAN 
answers the door.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttHello. uh. my name is Jeffrey

</b>tttOh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back

Sandy is a very good looking, high school senior and Mike is a big, 
handsome football player type.

Detective Williams' study is filled with filing cabinets.  The desk has 
two phones and is covered with papers and folders and a picture of Mrs. 
Williams and Sandy.  The police radio is asking for Detective Williams as 
they enter.

Detective Williams speaks through the radio while Jeffrey shuts the door.

As Jeffrey leaves the light of the front yard and enters onto the dark 
sidewalk, he hears Sandy call out behind him.

Jeffrey stops and turns around.  Sandy comes up to him.

tttThere are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, 
tttbut I think there are some people who were 
tttbrought in for questioning on a murder case 
tttthat could have something to do with the ear. 
tttI heard some of the same names.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttDo you know who was brought in for

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttThere were at least three, maybe four. But
ttta name that keeps coming up is this woman
tttwho lives in an apartment building very
tttclose to your house and also close to the t
tttfield where you found the ear. There's 
tttalso a business man over by the Franklin
tttfactory district that was questioned. and

tttsome parts of bodies were found down by
tttthe river. They were from people who were
tttreported missing. They never found one
tttcomplete body. only parts.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttThe ear is from a missing person maybe?

tttThey've had her under surveillance for a

Jeffrey and Sandy walk through the light of a street light.  The street 
sign "LINCOLN ST" can be read.  They walk into darkness and continue down 
to an apartment building on the right side of the street.

<b>tttttSANDY

tttThat's the building. She lives on the

tttYeah. Good bye.

Jeffrey watches as Sandy goes inside her house.  He watches her house for 
a moment and sees her cross the living room.  He turns and walks away.  

Again, the MYSTERIOUS CHORDS OF MUSIC swell up as Jeffrey walks through 
the night.

</b>tttHey, Ed, okay if I borrow these bug spraying
tttrigs later on?

Ed peers into the back room.  Spots Jeffrey.

Jeffrey is parked across the street from the school.  High school kids 
are pouring out the front door.  In a moment he sees Sandy come out with 
two or three other girls.  They walk down the sidewalk away from Jeffrey.

He starts the car and slowly follows them to the corner, where he pulls 
up alongside of them. very close. Sandy suddenly recognizes him.

Sandy pulls her girlfriends away from Jeffrey's car and says something to 
them.  There is some whispering and giggling and then,

</b>tttt  (to the girls)
tttPlease, don't say anything to Mike.

</b>tttThere are opportunities in life for gaining

tttAlright. the first thing is to get into her

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttRight out in the car I happen to have some

tttwill then jimmy a window.

Jeffrey goes into the lobby.

tttThat's a good sign.

He keeps climbing.  He arrives at the Seventh Floor. and finds Number 710. 
He knocks and waits.  He looks around. the hallway is empty.

DOROTHY VALLENS opens the door.  She is a very beautiful woman in her 
late thirties.  She has a beautiful full figure, dark eyes, black thick 
wavy hair.  Full red lips.  Right now, however, she looks a bit tired and 
a bit frumpy in an old terrycloth robe.

Jeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying.  All the while he's 
getting a good look around the apartment.

There is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape.  Jeffrey 
looks around to see what Dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying.
The apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very 
slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed.

Suddenly, there is knocking at the door.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttWhat is this. Grand Central Station?

She opens the door.  Jeffrey looks. It's not Sandy. A MAN, with a yellow 
sports coat, is standing there.  Jeffrey begins to sweat, because the MAN 
looked around Dorothy to see him.  Dorothy says something to the Man which 
Jeffrey cannot hear.

The next time Jeffrey looks up, the Man is gone.  The whole thing looks 
to be turning out badly when Jeffrey spots a key on the counter.  On a 
long shot, he steals it just as the front door shuts. He wraps things up 
and gets out.

They leave the building separately.  When Jeffrey gets to the car, 
Sandy isn't there.  He looks around.  He starts the car and drives off.

There, up ahead, he spots her.  He pulls over and she gets in.

The television is on.  Some crime show is playing, but the SOUND is 
very low.

The FAMILY DOCTOR is over and is giving Mrs. Beaumont an injection of 
medicine.  Aunt Barbara is sitting nearby.

<b>tttttDR. GYNDE
</b>tttThat will take care of you, Frances, for

Jeffrey enters the room - to say goodnight.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttDoctor Gynde. my whole family's sick.
tttWhat's going on?

<b>tttttAUNT BARBARA
</b>tttI'm not sick.

Jeffrey points to his head and makes a circular "crazy" gesture.  They 
all laugh, except Aunt Barbara.

tttWe'll see who stays in my will.

They laugh again.

They say their goodnights.

Jeffrey and Sandy are looking at each other.  Jeffrey turns back to 
driving.

Sandy watches Jeffrey drive then she turns and watches the stores and 
shops go by.

When she is turned away, Jeffrey turns and look at her.  Sandy is 
thinking.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttWhat's the plan.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttFirst of all, we're going to the Slow Club
tttto see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for

tttand then also we'll know she is there and
tttnot in her apartment.

The SLOW CLUB is a sleazy night club on the outskirts of town.  It 
has a dirty trash-strewn parking lot in front of it, where Jeffrey and 
Sandy park.  They get out of the car and enter the club.

They follow him and are seated.

The Maitre d' leaves.

On stage a FAT COMIC is telling jokes.  The jokes are tailored for this 
kind of working-class crowd.  The people are laughing.  The place is 
almost full.  Jeffrey and Sandy are taking it all in.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt    (to Waiter)
tttWhen does Dorothy Vallens come on?

<b>tttttWAITER

They pour their beers.

Later. Jeffrey and Sandy have just finished dinner.  The M.C. is arranging 
a floral art deco microphone and a SAXOPHONE PLAYER, a BASS PLAYER, and a 
DRUMMER are on stage.

<b>tttttM.C.
</b>tttt (very low key)
tttLadies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady.
tttMiss Dorothy Vallens.

There is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue 
laughing, talking, and drinking.  Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage.



She smiles. The house lights are still up. As she sings the first lines 
of "BLUE MOON" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on 
her as she sings the word, "Blue." This is a very sexy and slow version of 
the song.

During the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought 
that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into.

Jeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, "BLUE VELVET."  
They hear the first few lines before they get out the door.

<b>78. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

They hurry to the car, get in, and drive off.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:

Jeffrey and Sandy drive through dark areas of the city.  They don't talk 
as they drive, but again they sneak glances at one another.

<b>80. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
</b>
They turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop 
close to the building.  Jeffery cuts the engine.

It is very quiet.  Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or 
watching.  Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the 
Seventh Floor.  It is dark.  Sandy moves.  Every tiny sound is heard.  
Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttJeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhy not?

<b>tttttSANDY

Jeffrey nods.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttOkay, okay. Bye.

Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door.  He looks in one more time 
at Sandy.  They stare at each other silently.

Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car.  Sandy watches 
him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building.  She slides over and
sits in the driver's seat.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>81. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor.

SOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor.

He goes up another flight of stairs to the Eighth Floor and waits until 
the man goes downstairs.

Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710.  
He takes out the key and looks around. No one.  He inserts the key.  
It fits.  He turns it.  The door opens.

<b>82. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
He quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door.  It takes a 
moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.  Soon he finds his way 
around.  He decides on the closet to hide in.  However before he goes in 
to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the 
darkness.  He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom.  

Across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty 
child's room.  In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a 
propeller on top.  The kind that plays music when the propeller turns.  
The hat is sitting silently on the bed post.  He quietly closes the door.  
He returns to the closet.  Once inside, he checks out how much he can see. 
Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment.  This is where he 
will stay.  He moves around some to relax.  He takes several deep breaths. 
He looks at his watch.  It says "10:17."

<b>83. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Sandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and 
street.

<b>84. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
In the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to 
stretch his muscles which are getting tired.  Again, he takes several 
deep breaths.  He looks at his watch - it says 12:45.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt    (to himself)
tttOh no, hurry up Dorothy. Come on!. and I
tttgotta pee. Great. it's now or never.

Jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to 
the door of the bathroom.  His foot hits the door and it makes a loud 
noise.  He freezes.

<b>85. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
He moves again into the bathroom.  He starts to pee.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttHeineken.

</b>
<b>86. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Suddenly Sandy sits up alert.

<b>87. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
A car drives up and a MAN helps Dorothy Vallens get out.  They walk into 
the building.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>88. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else 
is so quiet the water SOUNDS seem very loud.

<b>89. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Sandy begins to honk the horn.

<b>90. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Unable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom 
as the tank is still filling.

SUDDENLY, he hears something. a key going in the door.  He bolts toward 
the closet.  He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front 
door opens.

Just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off - 
SILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door.

<b>tttttDOROTHY (V.O.)
</b>tttt(we're watching Jeffrey trying to 
  tttt control frightened breathing in

tttThanks Jimmy, see you tomorrow. You want a

<b>tttttJIMMY (V.O.)
</b>tttI better get back. thanks anyway.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttGoodnight.

<b>tttttJIMMY
</b>tttGoodnight now.

The front door shuts and the living room lights go on.  Jeffrey can see 
Dorothy come toward him.  She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when 
the phone RINGS.

She turns immediately and goes to answer it.  Jeffrey almost passes out. 
He thought he'd had it.  He overhears.


<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (on the phone)
tttHello. yes. yes sir, Frank. Let me
ttttalk to him. Please Frank, sir. I like
tttto sing Blue Velvet. Don? It's okay.
tttDon't worry. Don??. can you hear me?
tttIs little Donny OK? Is he there? Don? You
tttmean Meadow Lane? Frank?! What's the
tttmatter with him? I know. When? Okay. In
tttan hour. I'll be sweet. Momma loves you.
tttOkay Frank, sir.

She hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (to herself)
tttFrank, you son of a bitch!

She goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail.  She nervously 
gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides 
the photograph under a pillow on the couch.  She puts on a record, "FOR 
YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE."  She sits back down and chews her nail again, 
listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry.  She stops herself and takes 
the record off.  She starts taking off her stocking.  She then takes off 
her dress.

Underneath, she has on a bra and panties.  She crosses the living room, 
goes down the hallway into the bathroom.

Jeffrey can't see her too well now.  She takes off her panties in the 
bathroom.  She is now naked.  She looks at herself in the mirror.  We see 
Jeffrey's face as he watches her.  She disappears from view completely and 
we HEAR her start a SHOWER.

<b>tttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>91. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey's face.  He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again.  
He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can.

She opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe.  She doesn't 
see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden.  She closes the door.  It 
CLICKS shut.

Jeffrey is in almost total darkness.  He listens.  He can HEAR WALKING 
around, then silence.  He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING.

He HEARS her WALKING AGAIN.  Now he can see her.  She sits down on her 
bed.  She looks up.  Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight.  She looks at the
closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it.  
She slowly gets up.

Jeffrey doesn't know what is up.  He looks but she walks out of view.

SUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR 
FLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him.  When 
she realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud.

Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttThat's right. That's what I said. You
ttthave a good memory. Then what?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWell.

<b>tttttDOROTHY

tttNever before this.

tttGet undressed. I want to see you.

</b>tttNO, you come on. Take off your pants. I
tttwant to see you.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttLook. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttNo way.

Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife.  She goes to 
Jeffrey.  Now she has a knife and a gun.  He's scared.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttGet undressed. I want to see you.

Jeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks, 
Then his shirt.  He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them 
off.  Now he is only in his underwear.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b><b>tttSTAND UP.
</b>
He does.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (continuing)
tttCome closer.

Dorothy has a strange look on her face.  She reaches out and pulls 
Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees.  She looks at him.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (whispering)
tttWhat do you want from me?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt   (quietly, getting very hot)
tttI . I don't know.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (whispering)
tttWhat do you want?

Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice.  
She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttDon't move. don't look at me.

Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttDo you like that?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYes.

He tries to touch her.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttDon't move or I'll kill you.

She looks at him.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt   (continuing)
tttDo you like talk like that?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttNo.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttLie down on the bed.

He lies down.  He looks frightened.

There's a KNOCK, KNOCK on the door.  Dorothy looks VERY frightened.  She 
quickly moves a finger to her lips in a "quiet" sign and whispers to 
Jeffrey.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt (whispers, frantic)
tttShut up. Hurry! Go in the closet. Don't
tttsay anything or you'll get killed. I mean
tttit.

KNOCKING is heard louder at the door.  Jeffrey picks up all his clothes 
and gets in the closet.  He's naked and hiding in the closet.  Dorothy 
closes her robe and glides to the front door.

Jeffrey sees FRANK come in.

Frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut.  He is wearing a 
tight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket.  He's got on a pair of 
blue jeans and boots.  He has a raw, mean sexuality - a "bomb about to go 
off" - presence. 

He comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy.  He sits on the 
couch.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttHello, baby.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>                      (annoyed, condescending)
tttShut up. It's daddy. shithead.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttHello, daddy.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt  (can't-you-remember-
ttt   anything-attitude)
ttt. my bourbon.

Dorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink.  As she passes the 
closet, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face.

She returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank.  Frank 
sips on it.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt. sit down. get your chair.

Dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down.  She 
adjusts her robe.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt (studying her)
ttt. spread your legs.

Dorothy slowly spreads her legs.  She can see Jeffrey staring out of the 
darkness of the closet at her.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttwider.

She opens her legs wider.  Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his 
bourbon.  He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at 
Dorothy, her body - her crotch.

Dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting.  Frank suddenly reaches to his 
belt, where he has a small canister and a mask.  He opens a valve on the 
canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth.  The canister is 
filled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange 
sounding.  The result is frightening.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt   (high voice)
ttt. mommy.

Dorothy jumps.  She keeps looking at the ceiling.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt   (continuing, with high voice)
<b>ttt. MOMMY!.
</b>
<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (frightened)
ttt. mommy's here.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt  (high voice)
tttBaby wants to fuck.

Then, Frank's voice goes to normal.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt(normal voice, but loud - like
    ttt an army order to himself)
<b>tttGET READY TO FUCK!
</b>
Frank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her.  He takes one more 
gasp of helium.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt   (high voice)
tttBaby wants blue velvet.

Dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt   (whispering)
tttOkay.

Frank slowly moves

Frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the 
texture of the velvet.  His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body 
underneath.  His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the 
velvet robe.

Dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear.  
Then Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug.  He 
warns her.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttDon't look at me!

He begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth.  Then, he pushes her 
arms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way.  Frank 
sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and 
feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way.  
Dorothy is moaning.  Frank is breathing very heavily. He feels her crotch.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttDon't look at me!!!
ttt     (heavy breathing)
tttDaddy's home.

He starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy.
He starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him.  Faster 
and faster, then he has a climax in his pants.  Dorothy's head is falling 
back.  She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet.  
Cautiously, she looks sideways at Frank.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt    (screaming)
tttDon't look at me!!!

He slugs her in the face.  His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from 
deep within him.  On his hands and knees, he moves away.  The robe pulls 
out of his mouth.  His breathing is even heavier now.  He stands and 
begins to move around the apartment.  He goes to a wall, turns off the 
lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing 
big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying.  Dorothy moans softly.

It gets very quiet and still for a moment.  Then, Jeffrey hears Frank 
with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom.  The high, 
strange sound reverberates in the distance.  Jeffrey can't make it out - 
soon, he hears Frank's high laughing.  Frank comes back into the living 
room.  The mask is around his face.  All his breathing - every sound is 
high . He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttStay alive baby. See you next Christmas!

Frank leaves and shuts the door.  The apartment is silent except for 
Dorothy's moans.  

Jeffrey is stunned.  He doesn't move.  He watches Dorothy in the 
half-light.  She rolls over and starts crying.  The crying is deep and 
genuine.

Slowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her.  He bends down 
and touches her.  She flinches and turns to see him.  She turns back 
sobbing.  He tries to get her up.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhy don't you come lie down. Come on, I'll
ttthelp you.

She struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed.  
She falls down on her side, turned toward the wall.  He covers her with 
the sheet.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttDon't.
ttt    (referring to the sheet)
tttI don't like that. What do you want?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttNothing. Are you alright?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI'll go then.

He starts to put on his underwear.  They're inside out.  He tries to turn 
them around.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttDon?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttNo.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttDon. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me.
tttPlease.

Jeffrey turns to her.  He studies her.  He reaches out and takes her 
shoulders.  He moves down and holds her.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (whispering)
tttThank you. honey.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt    (whispering)
tttIt's okay. It's okay.

They lie together for a long silent moment.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttDo you like the way I feel?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt    (hesitates)
tttYes.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttSee my breasts?  . See?

Jeffrey looks.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYes.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttSee my nipples?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYes.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (whispering)
tttYou can kiss them if you want. Fell them
ttt. They're getting hard.

Jeffrey starts to move closer.  Dorothy closes her eyes.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (continuing)
tttGo ahead. I don't mind.

Jeffrey can't help himself.  He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her 
breasts.  They both are getting very hot.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttFeel me.

Jeffrey is all over her now.  Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttYou can hit me, if you want to.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttNo. please. I won't.

Dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the 
wall.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttStop it!

She moves and won't let him feel her anymore.  She holds his hands away.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (whispering)
tttDo you like me?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt    (whispering)
tttYes, I like you.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (whispering)
tttYou can be my special friend and come and
tttput that in me.

They start making love.  Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhat's the matter?

Suddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face. very hard.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttGet off me.

Jeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face.  Dorothy goes into 
the bathroom crying all the way.  Jeffrey sits, confused.

Suddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy.  A true scream of 
horror.  He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong.

<b>92. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
She is just flushing something down the toilet.  The water SOUND rushes.  
He turns to her.  She is trembling and in a state of shock.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttI made it go down the toilet.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhat?

He looks in the swirling water. It looks like an ear revolving around and 
around then whatever it is disappears.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttI made it go down the toilet.

Jeffrey looks up. he sees written with a bar of soap the words "look down" 
on the mirror.

He looks down into the sink.  At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood 
and a smear of fresher blood.

Jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating
in the bathroom.

tttYou don't?

</b>tttMaybe you don't know. I know you though.
tttYou're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttPlease don't talk like that. You're upset.

tttt     (laughs)
tttSometimes I think it would be fun.

tttGo ahead, you better leave now. I can't

tttI want to die.

tttI'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt (frightened by her craziness)
<b>tttO.K.
</b>
He takes another look at the blood in the bottom of the sink.  He takes 
another look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of Dorothy Vallens, and 
turns, goes through the hall to the living room.  He crosses slowly to the 
door, suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the 
bathroom.  He stops and looks at Dorothy who is turned away from him.  
She stares into the sink.  Jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has 
been cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI'm leaving now.

She is whispering something to herself.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt (very faint whisper)
tttHelp me. help me. please help me.

Jeffrey doesn't know what he can do.

<b>96. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey turns back, goes through the living room.  He looks around and 
sees the empty bourbon glass of Frank's.  Suddenly he remembers the 
photograph that Dorothy hid.  He picks up the pillow and sees a picture 
of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed 
hat with a propeller. He turns the photo over and finds an old marriage 
license.  It reads: Dorothy Vallens to Don.

<b>tttttJEFFREY (V.O.)
</b>tttDon. Oh my God.

He hides the photo again.  He sees Dorothy's telephone.  He memorizes the 
number - moving his lips with each digit.  He goes to the front door and 
opens it quietly.

<b>97. EXT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
He looks out into the hall.  It's empty.

<b>97A. INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
He quickly goes to the back stairway and down the stairs.  These steps are 
cement and his feet make echoing sounds which seem very loud.  He goes 
through a door marked "EXIT".

<b>98. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT
</b>
. and comes out, crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk.

He walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths.  He looks at his watch.  
2:30.  He feels so confused, exhilarated, so uneasy.  He secretly worries 
about what he's gotten into.

<b>99. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey enters the house. THE CAMERA RUSHES along the rug in the dark to a 
foot.  The lights come on.  PAN UP the leg to Mrs. Beaumont waiting in a 
chair, staring.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt     (startled)
tttGod. you scared me.

<b>tttttMRS. BEAUMONT

tttt    (long pause)
tttWell, Louise, I wish you a lot of

Jeffrey hangs up the phone hard.  He shakes his head.

<b>101. INT. BEAUMONTS' HARDWARE STORE - DAY
</b>
Jeffrey's drinking a cup of coffee behind the counter in the store.  
He thinks.  He takes another drink of coffee and sets the cup down.  
He clasps his hands behind his back and begins pacing up and down.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt(to himself, out loud)
tttHow can I help her? I can't tell her to go
tttto Detective Williams. She'll think I'm a

tttWhere the hell is Don? - maybe he died.

Jeffrey dials the phone.

tttOkay. Hi Sandy. Can you talk? He is?.
tttWell, I guess I'll talk to you later on.

<b>102. INT. HOSPITAL LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
The searching, mysterious MUSIC plays over while,

A DOCTOR is looking at various blood samples under a powerful microscope.  
Various sophisticated gadgets are seen in CLOSEUPS.

<b>tttttJEFFREY (V.O.)
</b>tttThis is what my father's disease looks like?

<b>tttttDR. GYNDE
</b>tttYes.

The BLOOD is seen in CLOSEUP. Cells are moving.

The Doctor makes a change in magnification.  The cells are huge - then, 
even bigger.  They are so big we can hear them moving.

<b>103. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT
</b>
The parking lot is half-full.  A strong wind is blowing trash around.  
Jeffrey parks his car.

<b>104. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT
</b>
. and enters the club. He speaks to the Maitre d'.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttA table in back, please.

<b>tttttMAITRE D'
</b>tttCertainly

Dorothy is singing her opening song as the Maitre d' seats Jeffrey.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI'll have an ice-cold Heineken.

<b>tttttMAITRE D'
</b>tttOne Heineken, certainly, sir.

Jeffrey surveys the place after the Maitre d' leaves.  It is very dark and 
smoky inside.  He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting 
with some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing.  They are sitting two tables 
away.

Frank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious-
looking.  He looks right up to her eyes.  In his hand he works a small 
piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers.  Again her first number, 
"BLUE MOON," segues into "BLUE VELVET."  This song she sings mainly to 
Frank.  When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else 
applauds loudly.

Jeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside.

<b>EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT
</b>
He looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's.  He gets 
into his car and pulls out across the street, re-parks the car and waits.

<b>tttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>106. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT
</b>
Traffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the 
SLOW CLUB.  Among them are Frank and his friends.  They get into a black 
Ford Fairlane and drive out of the parking lot - down the highway.  
Jeffrey starts his engine and moves out after them.  He has to gun the car 
up to sixty-five to catch up with them.

<b>107. EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
The mysterious MUSIC plays.

He follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right.  
He waits at a light right behind them.  Inside they are lighting 
cigarettes.  The light turns green and Frank takes off.  Jeffrey follows 
them through a dark area down by the docks.  He follows them up a narrow 
street through dark factories.

<b>108. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Dark, low MUSIC now.

Up ahead, Frank parks his car.  Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his 
lights and engine.  He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment
building next to a bookbinding factory.  They disappear within.  The 
electric lines above buzz loudly.

Jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street.  He reaches 
Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down.  
He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it
down in his notebook.  He continues on to the apartment building.

<b>109. tINT. LOBBY - FRANK'S BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Inside he looks at the names on the mailboxes.  He sees a name - Frank 
Booth.  The name gives him the chills.  The apartment number is 26.

In the distance, he hears footsteps.  He quickly leaves.

<b>110. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT
</b>
. and crosses the street down to his car.  He gets in and waits.  Frank 
comes out of the building and crosses to his car.

He follows Frank as he pulls out.

Jeffrey discreetly parks just after Frank kills the engine on his car.  
He watches Frank leave the parking lot.

<b>112. EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT
</b>
He follows Frank through the same vacant lot where he found the ear.  He 
seems to use the lot as a secret short cut to Dorothy's apartment.


<b>113. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey goes back to his car to wait.

<b>tttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>

A storm is building.  There is a roar of thunder as Frank slams his car 
door as he gets in.  His mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine 
and leaves.  Jeffrey waits till Frank is safely gone.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt       (thinking out loud)
tttI shouldn't go in. I shouldn't. but I'm
ttttoo curious. and I have to try to help her.

He then gets out of his car as the wind is building.

</b>
. and runs through the vacant lot.

<b>116. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
. to Dorothy's building.

<b>117. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
He goes up to the seventh floor and knocks twice on 710.  A moment passes, 
then the door flies open.

Dorothy looks as if she was expecting Frank to be coming back.  Dorothy 
<b>LOOKS BAD.
</b>
<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttHi. can I come in?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>ttt  (looking around the hallway)
tttYeah. hurry up though.

Dorothy breaks down crying.

<b>tttttDOROTHY

tttfrom but. I like you.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttThat's not crazy. I like you too.

Dorothy looks up.  They stare at each other for some time.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttI liked being with you last night.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt. same here.

There is a loud knocking on the door.

tttOh shit.

</b>tttt    (frightened)
tttFrank? .can you stand up?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttI'm alright. go hide. This won't 
ttttake long. Be quiet.

Jeffrey gets in the closet and Dorothy closes the door.  She holds her 
head collecting her fragile self.  Dorothy goes to the door and opens it.
It's the Man with the Yellow Sports Coat - tonight he's wearing a purple 
sports coat and light blue double knit pants.  His eyes are glazed and his 
face is broken out in a sweat.

<b>tttttYELLOW MAN

tttNo way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank.
tttI'm gonna tell him what you said.

Dorothy kicks the door after he closes it, then she chains it.  Jeffrey 
comes out of the closet.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt (talking softly)
tttNice guy.  Who's he?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttWho's it, you mean.

SUDDENLY, Dorothy starts to shake and cry.

Jeffrey grabs her and shakes her and holds her tight to him.  She starts 
sobbing again.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (continuing)
tttOh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.

<b>tttttJEFFREY

tttThere you go again. stop saying that.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttTake it easy. What's goin' on anyway?.
tttWhy are you in so much trouble?

Dorothy is sobbing and Jeffrey is holding her.  There is a long silence 
and she calms down.

tttI. don't. okay. Just don't. just be

Dorothy takes Jeffrey through the kitchen and out the back.

<b>119. INT. BACK STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

</b>
The storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full 
moon.  The wind continues to moan.  They move to the roof top and Dorothy 
leads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building.  A very 
sad forlorn version of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" - creeps through the 
wind.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt (as she stares down)
tttLook.

tttDon?. Are you in with them?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttPlease. please stay.

She makes him kiss her. he really likes it.  Once again, Jeffrey and 
Dorothy get VERY HOT.  Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof.  Dorothy 
cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the 
roof.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhy Dorothy?

We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper 
into it.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttDon? I have to make it hurt. I want
tttthere to be nothing again. Don!!!
tttt(as she slams her head 
        ttt again and again)

She reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish 
kiss.  Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls.

<b>FADE TO WHITE:

The stars are so far away - the feeling is cold and lonely.

Darkness: There are bell tones sounding, and as each one sounds pin points
of light appear on Mr. Beaumonts distorted dream face.  He is trying to 
speak.  He's trying to say "Jeffrey."

<b>121B. 
</b>
Another dark image appears.  A robin sits in a tree at night.  Very close.
There is a slow low reverberating chirping sound.

<b>121C.
</b>
Now Dorothy's apartment building at night.  A very low angle looking up 
to the roof.  Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from 
the roof.  It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is 
a red high-heeled shoe.  As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of 
Dorothy's which open into a scream.

<b>121D.
</b>
Jeffrey wakes in his room - terrified.

<b>122. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

</b>tttWell, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry

<b>tttttAUNT BARBARA
</b>tttOkay honey.

Jeffrey leaves and Aunt Barbara moves about tapping on the walls.  She 
moves into a dark area and taps.  Something falls.  She reaches down.

In EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick 
carpet.  Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the 
termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look.  She 
looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls.

We GLIDE ALONG the dark walls of the house.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttI mean, you don't exactly have the build
tttfor a football. I mean. no offense.

Jeffrey looks around and sees Sandy looking at him.  She then gives a 
stern look to Mike.  Then Mike and Sandy both look at Jeffrey.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt   (not offended)
tttNo. you're right.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttI mean. some guys play anyway but they
tttusually get slaughtered.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYeah, well I never wanted to get 
tttslaughtered much.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttt(not getting any humor)
tttWell, most guys don't. I mean that's the
tttpoint. You all mind if I take my vitamins?

<b>tttttMRS. WILLIAMS
</b>tttNo, Mike. but there are vitamins in the
tttfood, you know.

Everyone laughs.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttYeah, but I gotta supplement that. I gotta
ttttake a bunch of zinc too. The body is like
ttta machine. EVERYTHING has got to stay in 
tttperfect tune for perfect health. That's 
tttwhat I'm interested in.

Sandy looks at Mike.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttOh yeah. and a few other things.

Everyone laughs again.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttWe've got some Heinekens.

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttYeah. I like Bud myself.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttI'll get it. Mike, whatiya want?

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttI guess another glass of water.

Sandy and Jeffrey share a look.

<b>tttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>124. INT. WILLIAMS' BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Mike and Sandy are sitting on a couch in the basement.  Jeffrey is sitting
on a chair nearby.  The television set is on.

<b>tttttMRS. WILLIAMS
</b>tttt    (calling downstairs)
tttWho wants dessert? It's blueberry pie. and
tttice cream.

Jeffrey and Sandy say "yes."

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttNone for me, thanks.

Jeffrey looks over at Sandy.  Mike sees this.  There is more tension 
growing.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttt (referring to T.V.)
tttWhat are watchin' this junk for?

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttYou can change it if you want to.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttI don't know why we have to watch T.V.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttMike. We don't have to watch it. Come
ttton.

Mrs. Williams comes downstairs carrying a tray with dessert.

<b>tttttMRS. WILLIAMS
</b>tttHere you are. Would anyone like coffee?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttThat sounds great!

<b>tttttMRS. WILLIAMS
</b>tttAnyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a 
tttminute.

Mrs. Williams goes back upstairs.  Jeffrey and Sandy start eating their 
dessert.  Sandy watches Jeffrey happily wolf down his pie.  Mike stands up.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttI'll be right back.

He leaves as if he's going to go upstairs.  Once around the corner he 
stops and listens to see what Jeffery and Sandy will say to one another.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttWell, how did it go?. What happened?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWell. I've found out some things.
tttnothing really for certain. There are some
tttstrange people involved.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttWhat did you see?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWell.
ttt  (looking around, feeling funny)
tttMaybe we should discuss this somewhere
tttelse. you know what I mean?

Just then, Mrs. Williams starts down with the coffee for Jeffrey.  
She sees Mike at the bottom of the stairs.  This seems strange to her.

<b>tttttMRS. WILLIAMS
</b>tttMike?. Are you alright?

Mike starts upstairs.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttt   (mumbling)
tttYes.

Downstairs, Jeffrey and Sandy hear that Mike was close by.  Mrs. Williams 
and Mike pass on the stairs and Mrs. Williams enters the basement.  She 
throws Sandy a concerned look.  Just then, Mike calls downstairs.


<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttSandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttt   (calling up)
tttSure. just a sec.
tttt   (to Jeffrey)
tttExcuse me.

Upstairs, Mike is by the front door.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>tttCome on out a minute, okay?

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttOkay.

They leave.

<b>125A. INT. WILLIAMS' BASEMENT - NIGHT

Downstairs Mrs. Williams picks up some dishes.

<b>tttttMRS. WILLIAMS
</b>tttPlease excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll
tttget to the dishes.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttSure thing. please don't worry about me.
tttCan I help you with the dishes?

<b>tttttMRS. WILLIAMS
</b>tttNice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly
tttnot. just relax and enjoy your coffee.
tttI'm sure Sandy will be back soon.

Detective Williams comes to the top of the stairs and calls down.

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttJeffrey?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYes?

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttIf you want to come up a minute, I'll show
tttyou some pictures.

<b>126. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey enters Detective Williams' study.

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>ttttt   (continuing)
tttTake a look at these. These are the photos
tttof the vacant lot where you found the ear.
tttYou might find them interesting.


Jeffrey begins going through the pictures.  They are 8 X 10 black and 
white prints.  Mostly they are pictures of weeds, but they look quite 
beautiful in an abstract way.  As he goes through them.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttThese are beautiful. How's the case 
tttcoming?

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttOkay.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttAnything you can tell me?

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttThe criminals are winning.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttIs that why you say it's horrible?

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttYes.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI guess you've seen some bad things.

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttYes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison
tttyour mind by telling you.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhy do you do it?

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttI won't let the bastards get me up against 
tttthe wall. It's an act of defiance.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYeah. I get it.

Suddenly Jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos.  A piece 
of cloth in the grass.  Carefully he asks.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhat is this? What color is it?

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttt     (leaning over to see)
tttBlue. It's Blue Velvet.

Sandy comes into her father's study looking upset.  Detective Williams 
puts the photos away.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttCan I use the car for a while?

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttSure. What's up?

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttI want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttA Dairy Queen?
tttt(he holds his stomach)
tttOh yeah? Sure, that sounds great.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>127. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Jeffrey gets in and Sandy starts the car.  She pulls out.  They drive away.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhat's with Mike?

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttHe got a little jealous.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI'm sorry, I didn't.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttIt's okay. Don't worry about it.

The car glides along.

Jeffrey and Sandy smile at one another.  They drive on.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttYou want a Dairy Queen?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttNo way. I'm about to blow up.

<b>128. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/CHURCH - NIGHT
</b>
Sandy laughs as she pulls the car curbside in a quiet street by a church.
The church pipe-organ music drifts softly into the night.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttYou want to tell me about it?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy.
tttthis is what I have found out. What I 
tttthink I have found out. Dorothy Vallens
tttis married to a man named Don. they have
ttta son. I think the son and the husband
ttthave been kidnapped by a man named 
tttFrank who has now cut off both of Don's 
tttears. I think he is holding them to make 
ttther do things for him. I think she wants 
tttto die. the ears were for her a warning 
tttto stay alive. there is another man 
tttinvolved. I call him the "yellow man".
tttyou saw his back the other day in the hall 
tttat her door. I don't know what he does but 
tttI think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. 
tttFrank is a very dangerous man.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttt    (quietly)
tttWow. Should you tell my father?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI don't see how I can. and I can't prove
tttany of this. I got all this information
tttillegally. also it could get you in
ttttrouble.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttYou saw a lot in one night.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt. Actually. I've been in twice.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttt     (uneasy)
tttTwice. without her sensing anything?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttttt(lying)
tttYes.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttt    (pausing)
tttDid you see her undressed?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYeah. I mean. a little, . you know.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttYeah?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt    (a searching, slight smile)
tttThat doesn't bother you, does it?

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttWho, me? Why should it?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt     (seeing some jealousy and 
            ttand happy for it)
tttThat's what I thought.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttYou're sure right. It is a strange world.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhy are there people like Frank. Why is
tttthere so much trouble in this world.?


<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttI don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the
tttnight I met you.
tttt(she reflects silently on 
                         this before proceeding)
ttt. in the dream the world was dark because
tttthere weren't any robins. you know, birds.
tttrobins stood for love. and all of a sudden
tttthousands of robins flew down and brought
tttthis blinding light of love. and it felt
tttlike that love would be the only thing that
tttwould make any difference. I guess. until
tttthe robins come there is trouble.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYeah I guess so.
ttt       (he turns to her)
tttYou're a neat girl.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttSo are you.
tttt     (laughs)
tttI mean you're a neat guy. We better
tttget back.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI guess so. you want to help me watch
tttFrank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's
tttplace tomorrow. with a camera.

Sandy starts the car and pulls out into the street.  They begin driving 
back.

<b>129. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttNo, silly - I'm still in school you know.
tttbut I'll meet you after school and you 
tttcan tell me what you've learned. You better
tttbe careful, Jeffrey.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI will.  I'll pick you up on the same 
tttcorner at three thirty-five, okay?

They pull up in front of Jeffrey's house.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttOkay. be careful.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttOkay, Sandy.

<b>130. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey gets out of the car.  He goes around to her side and looks down 
at her in the car.  She looks very beautiful.  He stands there for a 
moment.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttCan I give you a kiss good night?

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttt(pauses, trembling)
tttYou better not, Jeffrey.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttOkay. okay.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttGoodnight.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttSee ya tomorrow.

Sandy slowly drives off.  Jeffrey watches her go then turns and goes 
inside his house.

<b>131. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The house is very dark and quiet.  Jeffrey finds a note by the one table 
light is on.  The note is from his mother.  It reads, "Jeffrey hope you 
enjoyed yourself. See you at breakfast. Love Mom."  A postscript is written
on the note by Aunt Barbara.  "Jeffrey, honey, I found these. Love, Aunt 
Barbara."  Jeffrey sees that Aunt Barbara has left him two dead termites.  
He picks one up and studies it.  Again we see a huge CLOSEUP of a termite 
in the half-light.  Jeffrey shakes his head in amusement.

<b>132. INT. JEFFREY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey paces nervously.  He picks up the phone and mouthing the numbers 
he dials Dorothy's number.  There is a "click" but no one speaks.  
Jeffrey instinctively speaks.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttHello?

tttttFRANK (telephone V.O.)
tttSpeak to me Fucker.

Jeffrey hangs up immediately.  He's scared.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt   (to himself)
tttStupid!! So stupid. now she might be in
ttteven more trouble with Frank. I hope not.
tttI hope not. tomorrow I have to find out
tttmore about Frank.

<b>133. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY
</b>
Jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front 
door of Frank Booth's apartment building.  The camera is covered with a 
cardboard shoe box.  Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was 
wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching.

A LADY steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps.  
Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two 
pictures.


We see a MAN walk down the street and turn up the steps.  Jeffrey shoots, 
but really only gets the back of the man.

<b>JEFFREY
</b>tttDamn!

He replaces the cardboard box and continues eating.

<b>tttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>134. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY
</b>
Later in the day.  Jeffrey sits waiting.  He looks at his watch.  It says 
<b>2:00.
</b>
As he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man. the 
Yellow Man.  They head for Frank's building.  Jeffrey hurriedly removes 
the shoe box and begins snapping pictures.  They mount the steps and 
disappear within the old dark structure.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWow.

<b>tttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>135. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY
</b>
Jeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt     (out loud to himself)
tttFifteen more minutes.

Just then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera.  He starts 
shooting as TWO MEN come out the door.  It is the Yellow Man and a man who
is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache.  He carries an 
alligator-skin briefcase FRANK HAS DISAPPEARED.  Both are talking together 
and now laughing.  Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to 
cover the camera as they approach.  The box falls.  The Yellow Man looks, 
but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the 
glove compartment.

The two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his.  
Jeffrey decides to follow them.  He waits a few seconds and starts off.

<b>136. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
They drive through town.

<b>137. FACTORY BUILDING - DAY
</b>
. to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building.  Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them.  At a metal landing they stop.  He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance.  The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees.  He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder.  Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point.  He looks at his watch. "3:25".

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYou gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll.

He quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase.

<b>138. EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</b>
. then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking.  At the 
end of the alley he turns left and stops short.

<b>139. EXT. COLD STORAGE COMPANY - DAY
</b>
He sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars.  He walks 
closer.  Through the crowd he sees a broken window.  Hanging in the window
is a dead man.  Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head.

On the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock.  
Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head 
in horrible positions.  Jeffrey stands next to two black guys.  Suddenly 
one of the police officers start pushing everyone away.  Jeffrey turns to 
them.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhat happened?

<b>tttttGUY #1
</b>tttHe was blown away man. can't you see?

<b>tttttGUY #2
</b>tttThat cracker was the biggest dealer in

tttthere than you can believe. It's a

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttOh yeah? What about the woman?

<b>tttttGUY #1
</b>tttProbably just a whore he happened to be
tttwith at the time.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttMan oh brother.

<b>tttttGUY #1
</b>tttThis is the way the world is my man. take

Jeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:

Jeffrey drives up to the corner where Sandy is standing.  She is 
frantically looking around.  Jeffrey stops for her.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>ttt    (looking beyond the car)
<b>tttGO ON!!!. GO!
</b>
Jeffrey looks around.  A big FOOTBALL PLAYER is running up to a chain 
link fence across the street, but it's too late - Mike sees Jeffrey.  
Everything stops for a moment.  Then, Mike runs off.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttOh great.

</b>tttYou know, that cheese is practically
tttall chemicals.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttThat's what makes it so good. You wanta

</b>tttNumber one. I saw the Yellow Man go into 
tttFrank's building, laughing with Frank.
tttNow. the only trouble is. what does this
tttprove?

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttt    (thinking)
tttNothing really, but it's interesting.
tttthey know each other. they seem to like
ttteach other.



<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttMaybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on 
tttdrugs. I think Frank supplies him.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttOh yeah?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttNumber two. I saw the Yellow Man come out.
tttThis time with a well-dressed man with an
tttalligator briefcase. They drove down this
tttfactory building and stood on a staircase
tttlooking at something in the distance. 
tttNumber three. now get this. In the distance
tttwas a murder. a drug dealer shot to death
tttand a woman with her legs broken.

<b>tttttSANDY

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYeah.

tttI'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning.
tttand it's all secret.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttYou like mysteries that much?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYeah. you're a mystery. I like you.
tttvery much.

Jeffrey stands up and moves to her side of the booth.  They stare at each 
other.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttOh yeah?

Jeffrey leans over and kisses her gently.  She pulls away.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttDon't. please, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey looks at her for a moment.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYou worry about me really?

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttYes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I
tttworry. a lot. I got you into this.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:

<b>143. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey winds his way up the staircase of Dorothy's apartment building.  
He hesitates before crossing to Dorothy's door.  He knocks on the door and 
Dorothy opens it.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttCome in.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttHello.

<b>144. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Dorothy closes the door.  She chains it.

They kiss.  The kiss gets hotter.  The feeling begins.

They move down the hall to the back bedroom.  They've never made love 
there.  As they hurriedly undress Jeffrey sees the pointed child's hat 
with the propeller.  He picks it up and spins the propeller.  It makes a 
bit of music.  Dorothy shrieks as she lurches toward Jeffrey grabbing his 
hand, stopping him from turning the tiny propeller.  She gains some 
control of herself.  Jeffrey releases the hat into her hand.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttIt used to make me laugh .but.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttYes. Frank-

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttFrank is coming?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttNo. how could he?. Don't go. You think
tttI'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.
ttttt(crying)
ttt. don't hate me.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt   (very nervous)
tttI sure don't hate you.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttI'm not crazy.
tttt     (thinking)
tttI know the difference between right 
tttand wrong.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttThat's good.

Jeffrey moves to get out of bed.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt    (she poses)
tttDo you like my body?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttSure I do.

She moves closer to him, towards his back touching it with her tongue.  
She gets down in a pose and holds it.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttI'm a statue. you can feel me.you
tttcan do anything you want.

Jeffrey's hands find her flesh and move about.

<b>tttttttttDISSOLVE TO:

Jeffrey and Dorothy are making love in her bed in almost total darkness.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt     (dreamily)
tttWhat do you want to do?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI'm doing it.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttAre you a bad boy?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhatiya mean?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttDo you want to do bad things?

tttAnything. anything.

tttWhat do you want?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttI want you to hurt me.

<b>tttttJEFFREY

tttI want to help you. I think I know some of

tttt  (she doesn't react)
ttt. Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son.
tttDorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do 
tttsomething Dorothy. go to the police.


<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttNo police!!!.
ttt (pushing herself back against
ttt  the headboard; then frantic)
tttNo police!!

Suddenly, Dorothy gets very odd.  She turns into a little girl.  She has
a frightening little girl smile.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttYou like to open me. don't you?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYes.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt(thinking with a grin)
tttWhat if I told Frank that you opened me?

For just one quiet moment we see the stairway to Dorothy's apartment.  
It is empty.  Then back to Jeffrey and Dorothy.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttThat wouldn't be too good, would it?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttFrank would open you.

</b>tttWhat if Frank came over here and found us?

The curtains in the kitchen bellow out with an eerie gust of wind.

</b>tttLook, snap out of it, will ya?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttKiss me.

They kiss.



<b>tttttDOROTHY

She bolts up.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For
tttcryin' out loud!

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttJust get outta my bed.

She hits out at Jeffrey and strikes him in the face.  Jeffrey struggles 
with her to keep her from hitting him again but she breaks loose and slams
out at his face again.  He pushes back hard and her head actually hits the
wall.  She smiles through the pain.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttOh God. are you alright.

She falls on him and smothers him with kisses.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttSee. see how you hurt me? Now. Open
tttme. enter me.

Jeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness.

We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper
into it.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttI love you Don with all my heart.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttNo. it's not Don.

But he can't stop himself or her from making love.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttCome inside me. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
tttt   (very frantic)
tttOh yes, oh yes, oh yes.

The movement subsides.  There is silence in the room, except for breathing.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI didn't mean to hurt you.

tttHmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttNo. not really.

tttbut also because I really want you 
tttto be alright.

Dorothy stops and looks at him - she holds his face.  She starts to cry.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttYou do .you really do.

She continues holding his face - looking in his eyes crying openly.  
he pulls him down to her.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttJeffrey. Jeffrey. Jeffrey.

Jeffrey smiles.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttI guess I should go.

Later.  Jeffrey is dressed and Dorothy comes out of the bathroom in her 
robe.  She is combing her hair.  One or two lights are on now.  She looks 
at Jeffrey and smiles, brushes some of his hair back from his face.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttYou're my special friend, aren't you?
tttt     (whispers)
tttI have you inside of me still.
tttt     (big smile)
tttIt helps me. I need you.

Jeffrey doesn't know what to say.  He starts walking toward the door with 
Dorothy beside him.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttttt(lying)
tttI'll call you.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttOkay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhat?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttI'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYou look beautiful to me.

She pats her hips.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttRight in here. fat, fat, fat.

Dorothy takes the chain off the door and opens it.  The hall is empty.  
There is some noise on the stairs.  Suddenly, Frank and TWO FRIENDS of 
his come into view on the stairway.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt    (to Dorothy)
tttOh no.

</b>tttOn a ride.

Frank grabs Jeffrey and pulls him along.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt     (continuing to Dorothy)
tttCome on. We're goin' for a joy ride.

<b>147. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Frank takes Jeffrey on a wide-eyed terror walk down the stairway.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>148. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
Frank and Dorothy are in the front seat.  Jeffrey is sandwiched between 
two very dirty strange guys in the back.  Frank is driving very fast and 
very crazy.  Sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which 
periodically blares out police reports.  At the lights, when they turn 
green, Frank lays rubber.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttWhere you wanna go? I know!. We gotta see
tttBen. We gotta, right?

<b>tttttPAUL
</b>tttt   (laughing)
tttYeah. we gotta see Ben. 

The car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs.  Liquor 
and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors.  They are blurred visions 
because of the speed of Frank's car.

Driving music plays.
Frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making
turns.  The Ford bounces off several curbs.  Dorothy occasionally steals 
a glance back at Jeffrey.  She squeals out loud - sometimes with glee, 
mostly in fear.

Raymond and Paul laugh with Frank, yell out or light cigarettes.

<b>149. EXT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT
</b>
Frank finally gets to where he's going - a corner bar - and skids to a 
hault.  They all pile out.  Frank grabs Jeffrey.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttCome on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine.
tttRaymond, get enough beer for Ben too.

<b>tttttRAYMOND
</b>tttOkay Frank.

<b>tttttFRANK

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt   (just says it)
tttHeineken.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b><b>tttFUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
</b>
He grabs Jeffrey and pushes him into the bar.

<b>150. INT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT
</b>
Moving fast now, they go through this dark frightening place.  Frank has 
Jeffrey by the neck forcing him faster.  In the back there is a black man 
fondling a white girl near a doorway.

<b>151. INT. BACK ROOM - "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT
</b>
They go through the door to a back room.  A few naked girls are there near
beds with curtains around them.  One girl lies on her bed with dried vomit
around her head and pillow.  Suddenly Frank spots his friend Willard.  
He runs toward him violently and grabs him by the throat.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttHey shithead. that's the last time I get
tttyou high and watch you freak out - 
tttmotherfucker you tore my coat and I lost

tttWhen you least expect it.

<b>tttttWILLARD

<b>tttttFRANK

Frank pushes him down on the bed with the dried vomit whore.  They leave 
Willard.

<b>154. INT. STAIRS AND LANDING - BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
... and go up a flight of dirty wooden steps.  Frank bangs on a door at the 
first landing.  Raymond joins him with a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttHey Ben. OPEN UP. It's Frank.

A tall, slender man with a smoking jacket and a mustache opens the door.  
It's BEN.  His voice is very horse from years of smoking.

<b>tttttBEN
</b>tttt(very gracious)
tttFrank. Come in.

</b>tttHey, I brought some friends. and some

<b>tttttBEN

<b>155. INT. BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
The apartment is very large.  All the furniture is over-stuffed.  In 
the room there is a very much over-weight WOMAN dressed in black and a 
greasy-looking COUPLE.  On the couch, a YOUNG WOMAN plays with a large 
doll.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt   (getting higher all the time)
tttSuave. goddam are you suave, you fucker.
tttYou want some beer?

tttCertainly Frank.

tttDarling, get some glasses. We'll have 
tttsome beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?

Everyone kinds of mills around.  Paul sits down in a chair and starts 
laughing at some private joke in his head.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttShit Ben! How the shit are ya?

</b>tttFine Frank. Fine. How are you?

<b>tttttBEN
</b>tttDarling, where are the glasses?. Oh.

The Big Lady brings the glasses in and sets them on the card table.  
She looks worried.  She gives a helpless pleading look to Ben.

tttCheers. Suave man. you're so fuckin'

Frank slaps Jeffrey in the face.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttHey neighbor. Here's to Ben.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt    (stunned, grabbing his face)
tttHere's to Ben.

Ben goes to Jeffrey.

<b>tttttBEN
</b>tttThank you neighbor. let me see your

Jeffrey shows him.

<b>tttttBEN
</b>tttt  (continuing)
tttOh. my.

Suddenly Ben slugs Jeffrey in the stomach.  Jeffrey doubles over.

<b>tttttBEN
</b>tttt(continuing again)
tttIs that any better?

Frank almost dies laughing.  Everyone else joins in.  Ben turns to Frank.

<b>tttttBEN
</b>tttFrank, I have something for you. Excuse
tttus everyone.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttEXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see

As Jeffrey tries to catch his breath, he sees tremendous emotion fill 
Dorothy's face.  She rushes forward.  Raymond grabs her by the arm and 
takes her into another room.  Jeffrey hears her crying out.  He hears a 
small boy.

<b>tttttDOROTHY (V.O.)
</b>tttDonny, oh my Donny.

<b>tttttDONNY (V.O.)
</b>tttMommy!

<b>155A. INT. BACK ROOM - BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dorothy is sobbing and clinging to Donny.  He is crying and gripping her 
like a small monkey would grip its mother.  Suddenly Donny breaks away, 
screaming.

<b>DONNY
</b>tttMommy. You left me. you stopped loving me.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt  (coming back into Ben's living room)
tttOkay. let's hit the fuckin' road. we're

tttjoy ride with us, anyone? You?
tttt (looking around)

Dorothy rejoins the group.  She's in a state of shock.  Frank pinches her
cheek.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt   (continuing)
tttNo smile for Frank? No? Okay, fuck it.
tttLet's go. Oh you wanna come with Raymond?

Raymond has picked up the greasy girl.

<b>tttttBEN
</b>tttSee you Tuesday, Frank.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttRight Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck
tttanything that moves.

<b>156. EXT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT
</b>
They leave and pile back into the car.

<b>157. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
Now there are four in the back.  Raymond starts necking with the Greasy 
Girl.  They speed on into the night.  Frank drives through various dark 
streets.

<b>158. INT. FRANK'S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhat?

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttLet's take our neighbor out. Let him
tttfuckin' walk back.
tttt     (laughs)

As Frank is driving Jeffrey sees Dorothy nervously look at the road and 
surrounding countryside, then questioningly at Frank.  She senses something
about where they are going.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttWhere are we going, Frank?

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttHey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to 
tttthe country. maybe something for you too.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttt   (very anxious)
tttFrank?

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttYou want to see him too, right?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttYes, but.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttThen, shut up!

Frank sees Dorothy look back at Jeffrey.


<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt   (continuing)
tttHey. What's this fuck got to do with
tttanything.

<b>159. INT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
Frank angrily swerves the car off onto a small dirt road bouncing down 
it, screeching to a halt near an orchard of trees.  He turns violently 
around to Jeffrey.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttWhat are you lookin' at?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttNothing.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt   (locks eyes with Jeffrey; 
      tt    long pause)
tttDon't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see
tttthe whites of the eyes.
tttt(takes helium)
tttYou like me?.

Jeffrey is quiet.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt (still high voice)
tttLook at these. What are these?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttCome on, Frank. Let's go. Please.

Frank is doing something to Dorothy's chest but Jeffrey can't see.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttDon't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE
<b>tttTHESE?
</b>
<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttThose are my breasts.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttCan I feel 'em?

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttIf you want to.

Frank takes helium.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttBaby wants to pinch 'em.

She winces and tries to pull away.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt   (continuing)
tttWhat's the matter? Give 'em back. They're
tttjust a little red, that's all. let me feel
ttt'em again. Come here.

Frank pulls her over and starts to pinch her again.  It really hurts her 
and she is frightened and in pain.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttHey. leave her alone.

Frank pretends not to hear Jeffrey and pinches Dorothy's breasts real hard.
She stifles a scream.  Jeffrey gets mad.  He hits Frank hard in the face. 
Everyone is deadly silent as Frank turns to Jeffrey.  Frank stares at 
Jeffrey.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttNEXT! . out of the car fuck. HELP HIM
<b>tttOUT, RAYMOND!!
</b>
<b>160. EXT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
Frank gets out and presses his face against the rear window.  His distorted
face is hideous.  He opens the back door.  Raymond and Paul grab Jeffrey 
and pull him out of the car.  The Greasy Girl laughs nervously.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b>tttFrank. he didn't mean it. Leave him
tttalone. come on. He didn't mean it.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttShut up. Gimme your lipstick.
tttt    (takes gas)
ttt. Hey, pretty, pretty.

Dorothy doesn't move fast enough so Frank dumps her whole purse out on the
front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight.  He puts lipstick 
heavy onto his lips.

While Raymond and Paul hold Jeffrey.  Frank kisses Jeffrey all over the 
mouth.  Jeffrey tries to hit Frank and pull away, but Raymond and Paul 
have a hold of him.  Jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches 
of red lipstick on his face and mouth.

<b>tttttDOROTHY
</b><b>tttLEAVE HIM ALONE!! FRANK!!
</b>
Frank slams the front door shut to muffle Dorothy.  He grabs Jeffrey and 
presses his frightened face against the front window.  Then, the back 
window.  Then, he flops Jeffrey up on the hood with Paul's help and presses
Jeffrey's face against the rear window.  Inside the car, this show is 
crazy and scary.  Then, Frank takes Jeffrey over to the side of the car 
again.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt   (to Jeffrey)
tttYou're fuckin' lucky to be alive.
<b>tttLOOK AT ME!
</b>
Raymond pulls Jeffrey's face back so he's looking at Frank.  Dorothy and 
the Greasy Girl watch in terror.



<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttDon't be a good neighbor to her or I'm 
tttgonna send you a love letter. straight
tttfrom my heart, fucker. You know what a 
tttlove letter is? It's a bullet. straight
tttfrom my gun, fucker. Once you get a love
tttletter from me, you're fucked forever.
tttUnderstand, Fuck?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYes.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttI'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!

Frank takes a small square of blue velvet out of his pocket and begins 
feeling Jeffrey's face with it.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt (continuing; breathing heavily)
tttYou feel good. feel my muscles.

Raymond makes Jeffrey raise his arm and Jeffrey feels Frank's biceps.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttt  (continuing)
tttYou like that? 
                     (to Raymond and Paul)
tttHold him tight for me.

Suddenly Frank starts hitting Jeffrey in the face.  Dorothy screams at the
car window.

He rounds the corner and steps inside the office, when he stops short with
fear.  Detective Williams is not there, but sitting at a desk next to 
Detective Williams' desk is the Yellow Man.  Their eyes lock.

Jeffrey freezes.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttExcuse me.

Jeffrey turns away as quickly as possible and goes over to a water cooler
and gets a drink, keeping his back to the Yellow Man.  He shakes with 
fear.  He slowly turns around.  The Yellow Man is studying some papers on
his desk.

Again the Yellow Man looks up.  This time he is slightly suspicious and he
cooks his head.  Jeffrey cannot move.

Finally, Jeffrey is able to step away.  As he leaves the Yellow Man's line
of sight, Jeffrey catches the names on the door.

Jeffrey walks through the darkness, carrying the photos.  He stops in

troubled look.  He approaches the front door.

He hesitates again before finally knocking.  Detective Williams answers 
the door.  Sandy is in the background.  When she sees the look on Jeffrey's
face, she knows why he's there.

he sees it.

tttThis is Frank Booth. His address is on

Jeffrey casually hands the photo over and watches Detective Williams' face 
extra carefully.  Detective Williams doesn't flinch, yet his eyes slowly 
glide upwards to meet Jeffrey's.

Jeffrey is driving over to Sandy's.

He has to park across the street because a police car is sitting in front
of the Williams' house.  Its lights are slowly revolving on top. The engine
idles. a Man is inside. his head down, studying some papers.

Jeffrey barely notices all this, as he heads for the door.

Mrs. Williams answers the door and Sandy is behind her in the dining room.

Detective Williams comes in arranging some papers which he begins placing
in a briefcase on the dining room table.  Just then a man comes up to the
door which is still open.  Jeffrey turns to see.  It is Detective 
T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  All the color instantly drains from 
Jeffrey's face.

<b>tttttYELLOW MAN
</b>tttt    (yelling inside)
tttHey John - get a move on!!

Detective Williams turns.  He sees Detective Gordon.  He turns again.  He 
sees Jeffrey's expression.  Sandy hasn't seen it yet.

Detective Williams goes to Jeffrey.  He looks him straight in the eye.  He
also positions himself between Jeffrey and T.R. Gordon.

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttEasy does it Jeffrey. Behave yourself.
tttdon't blow it.

Sandy becomes curious and moves over to Jeffrey and her father.  Jeffrey 
decides to trust Detective Williams.  The Yellow Man (T.R. Gordon) yells 
again.

Jeffrey and Sandy go downstairs to a basement which is dark and crowded 
with kids dancing and talking.  Jeffrey and Sandy are holding hands.  
Jeffrey feels a little out of place.

A COUPLE OF GIRLS raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to Sandy.
The music is loud, fast dancing music.

girl.  Sandy comes back to Jeffrey.

Just then, the music goes slow.

</b>tttYou want to dance?

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttOkay.

They begin to dance.  At first, further apart, then, they make the mistake
of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together.  
They move around to another look.  Then they kiss.  They kiss for the 
entire rest of the song.  Between songs and during the entire next song.  
They finally, as they say, come up for air.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttI love you, Jeffrey.

They kiss again.  Then they dance and look at each other.  Then they hug
each other.  As they hug, Jeffrey closes his eyes.

They say goodnight to the PARENTS in the living room and leave through the front door.  They can't take their eyes off one another.  They are totally oblivious to the THREE GUYS in a car across the street.

As soon as Jeffrey gets Sandy and himself in his car, he starts it and moves off.  

<b>194. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

The dark car comes to life with a loud low roar and peels out with a 
scream.  It follows Jeffrey and Sandy for a way, then it roars up behind 
them swaying back and forth, honking its horn and trying to ram Jeffrey's 
car in the rear.

Jeffrey looks frantically in the rear view mirror.  Sandy turns around in
fear.  Jeffrey guns his car and races down the street.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttOh my God. What's wrong?

He swerves around the corner.  Up ahead, a car is pulling out of a 
driveway.

                      to the car ahead)

Jeffrey swings hard around another corner and heads up a dark street, 
passing "Lincoln St."

<b>tttttJEFFREY

He floors the car and flies down another street very fast.

</b>tttMy father has a gun at home.

</b>tttNo.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttSandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise

Sandy turns back to take a look.  Jeffrey swerves the car again; he bangs
it off a curb as he rounds a corner.  A hub cap goes flying off rolling
noisily down the street.

Jeffrey floors the car again. but the car behind him is fast and gains 
on him.  It swerves back and forth in the rear view mirror.  Now it 
swerves and roars up alongside Jeffrey's car.  Sandy screams.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttIt's Mike! It's Mike!

Jeffrey looks over.  It is Mike.  Out of enormous sense of relief he 
starts laughing.  He slows instantly and so does Mike.

<b>197. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT

He pulls slowly up in front of his house, his head back laughing.  Mike 
swerves his car in front of Jeffrey's and jumps out.

tttYou shut up. nobody's talkin' to you.
tttHey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?

Everyone turns and looks.  Slowly out of the darkness comes a nude woman.  It is Dorothy.  She is totally in shock, bloody saliva is dripping from her mouth.  She is bloody, swollen and bruised all over.  She is totally different, drained of her sexuality.  She has been ravaged.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttDorothy! ... Dorothy!

<b>tttttSANDY

He jumps out of the car, gets a hold of her and helps her back.  Mike

Mike's friends are dazed, watching Dorothy staggering beside Jeffrey.  
Mike steps back as Jeffrey puts Dorothy in the car.  Jeffrey stands back
up and glances at Mike.

<b>tttttMIKE
</b>                       (dull, very drunk)
tttHey, I'm sorry. Hey.

Jeffrey gets into the car.

Jeffrey shuts the door.  Dorothy is sandwiched between him and Sandy in 
the front seat.

tttRight. Watch out for Mike, there.

Mike and his friends are getting in Mike's car.  Mike is trying to start 
the engine.  He does and clumsily throws the car in reverse.  He screeches
out and screeches to a stop.  Then he guns away forward and shoots crazily
down the road.

<b>208. INT. CAB - NIGHT
</b>
Driving through the night.

<b>208A. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey arrives at Dorothy's apartment building and pays the driver.  
He gets out of the cab and looks around.  No police.  Quiet.  The 
building looks just the same standing there in the dark.  The dim lights 
in the front entrance.  Jeffrey moves up to the front doors and enters.  
No one.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>209. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
Sandy is trying to get her father on the police radio.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttt (over the radio)
tttNo. he only wants my father to come over.
tttIt's very important. he said someone was
ttthurt and he wants Detective Williams there.
tttwell, find him!!

<b>210. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs.  His shoes squashing the carpet make 
mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building.

He arrives at the Seventh Floor and stops.  A high-pitched whine can be 
heard faintly.  It gets louder as Jeffrey crosses to Dorothy's apartment 
door.  He gets his key out and inserts it.  Turns it.  With a loud click 
the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing.  He sees 
something and jumps back.

<b>211. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, standing in the center of the room.

<b>FLASHBACK
</b>
He plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again.

<b>CLOSER ON DETECTIVE GORDON
</b>
Something is wrong with him.  He is bleeding from the head.  He stands 
almost motionless. in shock.

Jeffrey peers into the room again.  He enters carefully and lets the door 
close behind him.  He very cautiously moves forward into the room.  Slowly
he moves closer to a hideous sight.  Standing in the middle of Dorothy's 
apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  He is in an extreme state of 
shock.  He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head.  His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see.  Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his head.  A bullet hole in the center of his forehead.  The T.V. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine.  Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall.  The high whine stops instantly.  Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing.

Suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the Yellow Man's police
radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket.  Jeffrey's heart leaps 
and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a 
floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light.  Jeffrey's heart goes
wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and 
motionless again.  The radio talks again.

<b>tttttRADIO VOICE #1
</b>tttGet back and stay down.

<b>tttttRADIO VOICE #2
</b>ttt. It's apartment eight.

Music. LOVE LETTERS STRAIGHT FROM MY HEART. begins to play.  
Jeffrey watches the Yellow Man and listens to the radio.

<b>tttttRADIO VOICE #2
</b>ttttt (continuing)
tttI'm sending Jack and Pete to the roof.
tttIt's.

<b>tttttRADIO VOICE #1
</b>tttHey.

Sounds of shots.

<b>tttttRADIO VOICE #1
</b>ttttt (continuing)
tttHe's shooting. from the second window.

<b>tttttRADIO VOICE #3
</b>tttStay in place.

<b>tttttRADIO VOICE #2
</b>tttJack. get up there quick. can return
tttfire?.

<b>tttttRADIO VOICE #3
</b>tttI think he's alone. but return fire to

Many shots.

We see Jeffrey's face in CLOSEUP.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>212. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT
</b>
The real scene is before us.  Police cars line the street along with a 
huge fire truck and several ambulances.  Special police marksmen are 
crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite Frank's building.  
Screams are heard from within and police radios blare.  Shots are being 
fired into a black window.  Once in a while a shot is returned.  Two 
policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance.

<b>tttttPOLICEMAN #1
</b>tttHe hasn't fired a shot for six minutes.
tttmaybe we got him. get on the radio. get
tttDetective Williams. ask him if we can
tttrush the son of a bitch.

A policeman runs off. more shots are fired into the building but none 
are returned.  The policeman comes running back.

<b>tttttPOLICEMAN #2
</b>tttIt's in the works already. we're in 
tttthere. they're goin' down the back stairs 
tttnow. It won't be long. and they'll have
tttus rush 'em from here. one whistle and
tttwe go.

Suddenly there is a long barrage of gunfire into Frank's apartment.  
Then a loud whistle.

<b>tttttPOLICEMAN #1
</b>tttThat's it. let's go.

Police race across the street to Frank's building.

<b>213. INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Police kick the door in and rush into the apartment.  It's empty excpt for
a large dog which has been shot.  The dog growls and cowers back in a 
corner.  Every now and then it limps on bloody legs back and forth.

<b>214. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey hears the radio.  He hears the policemen talking at Frank's place.  He hears that Frank is gone.  He decides to leave Dorothy's apartment.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt (speaking to T.R. Gordon who doesn't
ttt  hear him because he's almost dead)
tttI'm leaving now. I'll let them find you
tttall on their own. find all this horror
ttton their own.
tttt     (whispers)
tttGood bye.

He goes out and closes the door.

<b>215. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
The door clicks shut.  He makes his way quietly down the hall to the 
stairway. thinking.  He starts down the stairs.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttSo. Frank escaped.

He rounds the corner on a landing on the stairway and goes down another 
floor. and another.  At the next landing, something out the window catches
his eye.  He notices a man get out of the car.  He recognizes the man.  
It is the well-dressed man he saw with the alligator briefcase.  Jeffrey 
watches the man come toward Dorothy's building.  Then his eye goes back 
to the man's car.  It is Frank's car.  He notices the man is carrying a 
police radio.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt    (to himself)
tttFrank's car. Is this man a cop? He has a 
tttradio!. So did Frank though and he's no
tttcop. that's for sure. and he's driving 
tttFrank's car. who is he?

The man enters the building at the front entrance directly below Jeffrey.

Jeffrey starts climbing back up the stairs. thinking faster.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttWhat happened that day?.

<b>216. EXT. FRONT STREET - DAY
</b>
<b>FLASHBACK:
</b>
Jeffrey remembers Frank and the Yellow Man go into Frank's building.

<b>217. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

<b>219. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttand out came. No it couldn't be. But I
tttthink it is!! It's Frank!!

Jeffrey runs like mad up to Dorothy's apartment.  He looks back once and 
sees the well-dressed man hurrying up the stairs.

CLOSEUP on well-dressed man's face. It is Frank, underneath a very good 
disguise.

Jeffrey has trouble getting the key out of his pocket.  He fumbles with it
and it drops to the floor.

Frank climbs the stairs.

Finally the key goes in and Jeffrey frantically opens the door.  He rushes
into the room.

<b>220. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
The horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again.  He 
rushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket.  
He runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he 
crouches down behind a double bed.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttt  (into the radio)
tttDetective Williams!! Detective Williams!!

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttt         (over radio)
tttDetective Williams here. Is that you,
tttJeffrey?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up 
tttto Dorothy's apartment.
ttt     (thinks; hits himself in the
                              forehead; inner voice)
                        Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing
                        everything we say!!
ttt      (thinks some more - fast)
tttDetective Williams. hurry. I'm in the 
tttapartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back
tttbedroom.

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttWe're ten minutes away and moving as fast
tttas we can.

<b>221. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Sandy runs frantically down a dark street.  We see a street sign which 
says "Lincoln."

<b>222. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Jeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room.  
He leaps safely into the closet just as Frank opens the apartment door and
enters.  Jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet.  Frank 
is smiling.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>ttt (calling pleasantly in the direction 
  of the back bedroom)
tttHey neighbor. shit for brains. You forgot
tttI have a police radio. I know where your
tttcute little butt is hiding. Here I come!
tttReady or not!

He starts down the hall to the back bedroom.  The police radio which 
Jeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting. 
Frank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttHey fuck. I can hear you radio! .Hey
tttyou stupid fuck. you got about a 
tttsecond to live.

Jeffrey watches Frank reach inside his coat for his gun.  He watches Frank
sneak to the back bedroom area.  Jeffrey turns and looks at the Yellow 
Man.  He gets an idea. He quickly rushes out of the closet - feels inside 
the Yellow Man's coat for his police gun.  It's there.  He gets it but it 
causes the Yellow Man to moan and leap some in another almost death-spasm.  Jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath.  Just then he hears Frank in the back room.

<b>tttttFRANK (V.O.)
</b>ttt           (helium voice)
tttHey pretty pretty.

Jeffrey then hears three or four shots - deadly sounding coming from a 
pistol with a silencer attached.

<b>tttttFRANK (V.O.)
</b>tttHey fuck, where are you?

Jeffrey sees a furious Frank come storming out of the back room and come 
slowly up the hall - directly toward him.

Jeffrey raises his pistol - very slowly.  Frank enters the living room.  
He looks around.  The Yellow Man moans.  Frank makes a face and blasts the 
remainder of the Yellow Man's head away and this time the Yellow Man falls
dead to the floor.  Jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air.  Frank looks to the kitchen. all around the living room.  He looks at the closet.  He smiles - he slowly goes right toward Jeffrey - smiling.  Jeffrey points the pistol.  His finger moves to the trigger.  He squints his eyes.  He doesn't want to kill a man. any man.  Frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when Jeffrey hears Sandy scream.

<b>tttttSANDY (V.O.)
</b>tttJeffrey!!

Frank and Jeffrey lock eyes as Jeffrey pulls the trigger.  He yells Sandy's
name and Frank's head is blown off.

We see Sandy's frightened face.  We see policemen racing up the stairs in 
Dorothy's apartment.

<b>223. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
We see cop cars with lights revolving, radios blaring.

<b>224. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</b>
The large room is crowded with policemen and members of the F.B.I.  
Everyone is talking excitedly.  Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting by Detective
Williams in wooden chairs near the center of the room.  We hear bits of 
conversation.

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttt         (to Jeffrey)
tttBecause of your information I alerted
tttinternal affairs to check out Detective
tttGordon.  I had to keep on with him as 
tttif nothing was different.  He slipped 
tttoff on his own when he found out we were
tttgoing to raid Frank's place.

<b>ttttt JEFFREY
</b>tttDoes Dorothy know her husband is dead?

<b>tttttDETECTIVE WILLIAMS
</b>tttNot yet.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttOh my God. Is her son OK?

<b>tttttF.B.I. MAN
</b>tttWe're looking for him. In your opinion,
tttwhy did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and
ttthusband?

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttHe became obsessed with her. She hated
ttthim. He had to have her. He kidnapped
tttthem to control her. to make her do 
tttthings. Then she wanted to commit 
tttsuicide so he started cutting off ears
tttas a warning to her to stay alive. I'm
tttnot kidding. Frank loved blue. blue
tttvelvet. He had to have Dorothy cause
ttther whole life was blue.

<b>tttttF.B.I. MAN
</b>tttYou seemed to see some very interesting
tttthings on your little escapade with 
tttDorothy Vallens.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttYeah. I guess I did.

  with a worried look)
tttWhat's going to happen to me?

<b>tttttF.B.I. MAN
</b>tttWe're going to leave that up to Detective
tttWilliams. I'll tell you though. you're

tttmany more are out there?

<b>FADE TO BLACK - DARKNESS
</b>
<b>225. EXT. BEAUMONTS' BACK YARD - DAY
</b>
A huge low roaring sound comes in.

SLOWLY WE COME UP OUT OF A HUGE DARK HOLE. We see we are rising out of an 
ear but still among the crevices.  They look enormous.  We move up and 
float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye.  Jeffrey's eye. 
His face is bathed in light.

All sorts of springtime-in-the-garden sounds are heard.

We suddenly see that Jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard. Detective 
Williams is with Mr. Beaumont working in the garden in the distance.  
The sprinkler is turning.  Sandy comes out on the back porch and calls.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>tttJeffrey. Lunch is ready.

Jeffrey opens his eyes.  He looks around confused for a moment.  He sees 
Sandy.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttOkay. I'll be right in.

Sandy goes back inside.  Suddenly, a big red ROBIN chirps loudly above.  
Jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree.  The Robin and Jeffrey 
seems to exchange a special look.

Jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird.

He gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of 
the house.  As he passes his father and Detective Williams:

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttHow ya doin' Dad?

<b>tttttMR. BEAUMONT
</b>tttt     (distant voice)
tttHey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>tttGood deal Dad.

He and Detective Williams share a smile.

<b>226. INT. BEAUMONTS' KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Jeffrey enters the kitchen and sees Sandy standing with Aunt Barbara by the
kitchen window.  Beyond, in the living room Mrs. Williams and Jeffrey's 
mother turn toward the kitchen when they hear the screen door slam.

A large Red Robin has just flown down to the window still carrying a big 
bug in its mouth.

<b>tttttSANDY
</b>ttt    (Referring to the bird)
tttLook Jeffrey.

<b>tttttJEFFREY
</b>ttt  (As he joins Aunt Barbara and
ttt   Sandy to look at the robin)
tttYeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe

A songbird SINGS in a tree.

We are in a beautiful park.  Slowly we move down and a little hat with a 
propeller comes into view.  The hat is on the head of a small child who is
dancing slowly toward Dorothy.  She is laughing.  When the boy gets within
arms reach they embrace.  We move close to Dorothy's smiling face.  Tears
of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we 
hear Bobby Vinton sing the last lines of his song.

"and I still can see Blue Velvet through
 my tears."

Blue Velvet dissolves in and takes over the image.
