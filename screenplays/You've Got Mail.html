</b>
<b>tFADE IN ON:
</b>
<b>tCYBERSPACE
</b>
tWe have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a
tsky that's just beginning to get light.  There are a few
tstars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big
tcomputer sun starts to rise.

tWe continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading
tover a computer version of the New York City skyline.  We
tmove over Central Park.  It's fall and the leaves are
tglorious reds and yellows.

tWe reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down
tBroadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and
 tturn onto a street in the West 80s.

tHold in front of a New York brownstone.

tAt the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the
twords:

<b>tADDING ART
</b>
tAs the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a percentage
tincrease from 0% to 100%.  When it hits 100% the image pops and 
twe are in real life.

<b>tEXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - DAY
</b>
tEarly morning in New York. A couple of runners pass on their
tway to Riverside Drive Park.

tWe go through the brownstone window into:

<b>tINT. KATHLEEN KELLY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
tKATHLEEN KELLY is asleep.  Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and
tfresh as a spring day.  Her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized
tbed and a desk with a computer on it.  Bookshelves line every
tinch of wall space and overflow with books.  Framed on the
tchildren's classic.  Madeleine.

tAs Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into
tthe room.  He wears blue jeans and a workshirt.  He's carrying
tthe New York Times.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttGood morning.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(as he reads)
ttListen to this -- the entire work force
ttof the state of Virginia had to have
ttsolitaire removed from their computers --

tKathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the
tbathroom, and we stay with Frank.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt-- because they hadn't done any work in
ttsix weeks.

tKathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttAren't you late?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou know what this is, you know what
ttwe're seeing here?  We're seeing the end
ttof Western civilization as we know it.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttThis is so sad.

tShe tosses him his jacket.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(points at her computer)
ttYou think that machine is your friend,
ttbut it's not.
ttt(checks his watch)
ttI'm late.

<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tAs Frank walks to the apartment door.  We see a charming room
twith a couch, fireplace, books, and a dining table with a 
ttypewriter with a cover on it.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN (O.C.)
</b>ttI'll see you tonight.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttSushi.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN (O.C.)
</b>ttGreat.  Bye.

tFrank goes out the door.  It closes.

tKathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye
tpeephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing
tfrom sight.  She walks into:

<b>tINT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
tAnd looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the
tstreet and turns toward Broadway.

tHe's gone.  Good.

tShe sits down at her computer.  An expression of anticipation
tand guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse.

<b>tINT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY
</b>
tAs we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's
tcode name: Shopgirl.  She logs on and the computer makes all
tits little modem noises as the computer dials the access
tnumber and connects and we hear the machine:

<b>ttttCOMPUTER
</b>ttWelcome.

tAnd we see Kathleen, listening for the words she's waiting to
thear:

ttttCOMPUTER (cont'd)
ttYou've got mail.

tAnd Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up:

<b>tINT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY
</b>
tWe see a list of letters:

tBig Cash Op: You can make $$$ in your spare time.  OIL MKT: You
tcan turn $20 into $20,000 THIS REALLY WORKS U CAN DO IT: 
tMaximize your selling ability nowwwww!!!  NY152 Brinkley

tKathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters --
tall of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.

tThen she selects the "Read Mail" key for "NY 152 Brinkley".

tAnd the letter comes up:
tt   To: Shopgirl
ttFrom: NY152
tt   Re: Brinkley

tKathleen starts to read the letter aloud:

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttBrinkley is my dog.  He loves the streets
ttof New York as much as I do --

tAnd now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of
tNY 152, a man named JOE FOX --

<b>ttttJOE (V.O.)
</b>tt-- although he likes to eat bits of pizza
ttand bagel off the sidewalk, and I prefer
ttto buy them.  Brinkley is a great catcher
ttand was offered a tryout on the Mets farm
ttteam --
ttt(continued)

<b>tINT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
tA dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. This
tis BRINKLEY.  The pillow has "Brinkley" embroidered on it.
tBrinkley's master, JOE FOX, a great-looking guy, full of
tcharm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself
tsome orange juice.  He's half-dressed.

ttttJOE (cont'd)
tt-- but he chose to stay with me so that
tthe could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on
tta large green pillow the size of an inner
tttube.  Don't you love New York in the
ttfall?  It makes me want to buy school
ttsupplies.  I would send you a bouquet of
ttnewly-sharpened pencils if I knew your
ttname and address.  On the other hand,
ttthis not knowing has its charms.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDarling --

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttMmmmmhmmm --

tJoe's girlfriend PATRICIA EDEN, in Armani head to toe, comes
tinto the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine,
twhich starts grinding beans.  She's carrying the morning
tpapers.

<b>ttttPATRICIA
</b>ttI'm late.
ttt(indicating the newspaper)
ttRandom House fired Dick Atkins.  Good
ttriddance.  Murray Chilton died.  Which
ttmakes one less person I'm not speaking 
ttto --
ttt(she drains a cup of espresso
ttt as a second starts to come out
ttt of the machine)
ttVince got a great review.  He'll be
ttinsufferable.  Tonight,  PEN dinner --

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttAm I going?

<b>ttttPATRICIA
</b>ttYou promised.

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttCan't I just give them money?  That's the
ttcause?  Free Albanian writers?  I'm for
ttthat.

tPatricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttAll right, I'll go.  You're late.

<b>ttt     PATRICIA
</b>ttI know I know I know.

tShe tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her.

tHold on Joe, listening as he hears the elevator door open and
tclose on the landing outside.

<b>tIT. JOE'S DEN - DAY
</b>
tAs he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs 
ton.

<b>ttt     JOE & THE COMPUTER (TOGETHER)
</b>ttWelcome... You've got mail.

tAnd as he starts to read his letter, we hear:

<b>ttt     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
</b>ttI like to start my notes to you as if
ttwe're already in the middle of a
ttconversation.  I pretend that we're 
ttthe oldest and dearest friends --
ttas opposed to what we actually are,
ttpeople who don't know each other's names
ttand met in a Chat Room where we both
ttclaimed we'd never been before.

<b>tINT. JOE'S ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
tAs Joe, dressed for work, takes the elevator down with his
televator man CHARLIE.  There's a certain amount of Good
tmorning, etc., as the elevator goes down and the voice-over
tcontinues:

<b>ttttKATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
</b>ttWhat will he say today, I wonder.  I turn
tton my computer, I wait impatiently as it
ttboots up.

<b>tEXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - DAY
</b>
tAs Joe comes out of his building.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
</b>ttI go on line, and my breath catches in my
ttchest until I hear three little words:
ttYou've got mail.

tAnd the camera now pans from 152 Riverside uptown to:

<b>tEXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - MORNING
</b>
<b>ttttKATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
</b>ttI hear nothing, not even a sound on the
ttstreets of New York, just the beat of my
ttown heart.  I have mail.  From you.

<b>tEXT. BROADWAY - MORNING
</b>
tAs Kathleen comes onto Broadway at the corner of 83rd Street
tand starts downtown.

tThrough a long lens we can see Joe, walking into blocks behind
ther.

tAs Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the
tWest Side of Manhattan in the morning.  Mothers and fathers
ttaking their kids to school, people on their way to work,
tdogs being walked.  School buses picking up kids, bakery
ttrucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of
tunopened restaurants.

tKathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the 
tnewsstand dealer, and picks up a New York Times.

tMetal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons,
tthe pharmacy, fish store, the Cuban Chinese Restaurant,
tZabar's.

tJoe stops at the same newsstand.  He buys all the papers --
tthe Times, Wall Street Journal, Post and Daily News.

<b>tINT. STARBUCKS - DAY
</b>
tAs Kathleen picks up her coffee, walks out.

<b>tEXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY
</b>
tAs Kathleen walks down Columbus, we see Joe a block behind
ther.  She stops to buy flowers and Joe passes her, crosses to
tthe Ease side of Columbus Avenue.

<b>tEXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY
</b>
tA building under construction, with plywood board covering
tthe front and wrapping around the corner.  Joe goes to a side
tentrance and enters.

<b>tEXT. COLUMBUS & 73RD STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tAs Kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in
tfront of her store, a children's bookstore called "The Shop
tAround the Corner."  It is an irresistibly inviting store.
tThere are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large
tstuffed animals reading children's books: Madeleine, Good
tNight Moon, Where the Wild Things Are.  A teddy bear in a 
tpinafore is reading The Stupids Step Out.  Waiting for
tKathleen in front is one of her employees, CHRISTINA.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttHello, Christina.  It's a beautiful day.
ttIsn't it the most beautiful day?

tChristina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first
ttime.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttI guess.  Yeah, sure.

tKathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which
trises, making a horrible noise.  Two cabs almost collide in
tfront of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts
tyelling obscenities at the other.  Kathleen unlocks the door
tto the store.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttDon't you love New York in the fall?

tChristina looks at her puzzled.

<b>tINT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tKathleen turns the CLOSED sign on the door over to read
t"OPEN" and she activates the computer system.  She looks
taround, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore,
twith wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read,
tsome charming posters and a glass case full of first editions
tof the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland, etc.  There's a 
tplayful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered
twith orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "The Ten Best
tWitch List"  and a collection of witch books -- "The Lion, The 
tWitch and the Wardrobe," "The Witches," "The Wizard of Oz."
tOn the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops.

tKathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and
tsuddenly stops to daydream.  A smile creeps onto her face.
tChristina looks at her.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttWhat's going on with you?

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttNothing.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttYou're in love.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttIn love?  No.  Yes.  Of course I am.
ttI'm in love with Frank.  I'm practically
ttliving with Frank.  Do you think you
ttcould get our Christmas mailers out this
ttweek?

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttBy Monday I promise.  I have a paper due
ttFriday.  Now what's going on?
ttt(she looks at Kathleen)
ttI'm just going to stand here till you tell
ttme.

tA beat.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttIs it infidelity if you're involved with
ttsomeone on E-mail?

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttHave you had sex?

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttOf course not.  I don't even know him.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttI mean cybersex.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttNo!

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttWell, don't do it.  The minute you do,
ttthey lose all respect for you.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttIt's not like that.  We just E-mail.
ttIt's really nothing, on top of which I'm
ttdefinitely thinking of stopping because
ttit's getting --

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttOut of hand?

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttConfusing.  But not really.  Because it's
ttnothing.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttWhere did you meet him?

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttI can't even remember.
ttt(off Christina's look)
ttThe day I turned thirty I wandered into
ttthe Over Thirty Room for a joke, sort of
ttand he was there, and we started 
ttchatting.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttAbout what?

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttBooks.  Music.  How much we both love New
ttYork.  Harmless.  Harmless.  Meaningless.
ttt(starts smiling)
ttBouquets of sharpened pencils.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttForget it.  We don't talk about anything
ttpersonal.  We made a rule about that.
ttI don't know his name, what he does or
ttexactly where he lives, so it will be
ttreally easy to stop seeing him, because
ttI'm not.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttGod, he could be the next person to talk
ttinto the store.  He could be...
ttt(as George walks in)
ttGeorge.

tGEORGE PAPPAS, in his twenties, one of Kathleen's 
tsalespeople, is a cute guy who has no idea that he's supposed
tto look in the mirror when he gets dressed.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttMorning.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttAre you On Line?

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttAs far as I'm concerned, the Internet is
ttjust another way to be rejected by a 
ttwoman.

tBIRDIE walks in.  She is in her seventies, has white hair,
tand is tiny, like a little sparrow.  She is the store's
toldest employee, having worked there for over forty years,
tand serves as a accountant as well as salesperson.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttGood morning, Birdie.

<b>ttttBIRDIE
</b>ttWhat are you all talking about?

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttCybersex.

<b>ttttBIRDIE
</b>ttI tried to have cybersex once but I kept
ttgetting a busy signal.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttI know, I know.  One Saturday night I was
ttreally depressed about not having a date,
ttso I thought, no problemo, I'll go on
ttline and I won't be lonely, but I 
ttcouldn't get on, there were hundreds of
ttthousands of people who didn't have dates
tttrying to get on.
<b>ttt(MORE)
</b>ttYou have to wonder which is harder,
ttgetting a date or getting On Line when
ttyou don't have a date.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttGetting a date is harder.

tWe hear the bell jingle as TWO WEST SIDE MOTHERS come in with 
ttwo KIDS IN STROLLERS.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttt(to the kids)
ttJessica and Maia, how are you today?

tWe hear the sound of the garbage truck.  Kathleen goes out
tthe front door to:

<b>tEXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY
</b>
tAs the commercial garbage truck pulls up and TWO GARBAGEMEN 
tstart to load her trash.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttHey, you forgot to pick up the garbage
ttlast week and I got a ticket.  And you're
ttlate today -- I could have gotten
ttanother.

<b>ttttGARBAGEMAN #1
</b>ttWe were here, there was no garbage.

<b>ttttGARBAGEMAN #2
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttOf course there was --

<b>ttttGARBAGEMAN #1
</b>ttWhat do you think, I don't want to pick
ttup garbage?  You think I go up and down
ttthe street picking up garbage, I'm not
ttgoing to pick up yours?  What's the
ttmatter with you?

<b>ttttGARBAGEMAN #2
</b>ttYeah.

tKathleen is standing there, tongue-tied.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttGARBAGEMAN #1
</b>ttYou don't even bundle it right, you're
ttsupposed to bundle it and leave it near
ttthe curb, you leave it near the store
ttand you use cheap garbage bags, they
ttsmear all over the place, and then I got
ttto pick it up with my shovel --

<b>tINT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tAs Christina, who's helping one of the customers, looks out
tthe window as the harangue continues.

<b>tEXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>ttttGARBAGEMAN #1
</b>ttAnd now you're busting my chops.  You're
ttjust another garbage pick-up to us, okay?

<b>ttttGARBAGEMAN #2
</b>ttYeah.

tAs Kathleen continues to stand there, speechless.

<b>tINT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tAs Kathleen comes back into the store.  Christina is ringing
tup a sale.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttThat guy went ballistic on me.

<b>ttttCHRISTINA
</b>ttI hope you told him off.

<b>ttttKATHLEEN
</b>ttNot exactly.

tAnother customer enters the store.  The bell jingles.

<b>tEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE ON COLUMBUS - DAY
</b>
tA little truck carrying a knife sharpener, its bells ringing,
tpasses the building under construction.

<b>tINT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
</b>
tWORKERS, ELECTRICIANS, MASONS, CARPENTERS, etc. in the 
tprocess of building what looks like a large store.  Wires
thanging everywhere.

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttThe electrical contractor called.  His
tttruck hit a deer last night, he won't be
ttin 'til tomorrow.  The shelves are late
ttbecause the shipment of pine had beetles.
ttAnd there's some question about whether
ttwe're installing the stairs in the right
ttspot --

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttThat sounds great.

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttTesting one two three four.

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttIs the electrician here?

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttI just told you -- he hit a deer.

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttI hear nothing.  Not a sound on the city
ttstreets, just the beat of my own heart.
ttI think that's the way it goes.
ttSomething like that.

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttt(beginning to glean something)
ttDid you and Patricia get engaged?

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttEngaged?  Are you crazy?

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttI thought you liked Patricia --

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttI love Patricia.  Patricia's amazing.
ttPatricia makes coffee nervous.
ttt(suddenly all business)
ttAre we still on schedule?

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttWe open two weeks before Thanksgiving.

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttI guess we should announce ourselves
ttsoon.  Tell people we're coming.

<b>ttttKEVIN

<b>tINT. FOXBOOKS - WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY
</b>
tJoe is in the office with his father, NELSON FOX, and his

tOn the wall we see the Foxbooks logo.

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttKevin and I are both a little concerned

ttWhat is this fabric?  Does it have a

<b>ttttNELSON
</b>ttMoney.  Its name is money.

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttGillian selected it.

<b>ttttNELSON
</b>ttOf course.

</b>ttYour father is getting married again.

</b>ttOh, great, congratulations, Dad.  Why?

<b>ttttNELSON
</b>ttWho knows?  Why does anyone get married?

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttLove.

<b>ttttNELSON
</b>ttYes, that is one reason.

<b>ttttSCHUYLER
</b>ttI think you're a damn fool.

</b>ttDad, Matthew is four.  It would be nice
ttfor him if his parents were married.

<b>ttttSCHUYLER
</b>ttAnnabel is eight and I'm not married to

ttt(he laughs merrily)

<b>ttttJOE

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttAnd I'm buying their entire stock --

<b>ttttNELSON
</b>ttHow much are your paying?

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttWhatever it costs, it won't be as much as

ttWe're also going to have a section on
ttWest Side Writers --

<b>ttttSCHUYLER
</b>tt-- as a sop to the neighborhood.

<b>ttttNELSON
</b>ttPerfect.  It'll keep those West Side

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttReaders.  They're called readers.

</b>ttDon't romanticize them.  It'll keep them

<b>ttttSCHUYLER
</b>ttWhat's the competition?

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttOne mystery store.  Sleuth, on 86th and
ttAmsterdam.  And a children's bookstore.
ttThe Shop Around the Corner.  Been there
ttforever.

<b>ttttSCHUYLER
</b>ttCecilia's store.

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttWho's that?

<b>ttttSCHUYLER
</b>ttCecilia Kelly, lovely woman.  I think we
ttmight have had a date once.  Or maybe we
ttjust exchange letters.

<b>ttttJOE
</b>ttYou wrote her letters?

<b>ttttSCHUYLER
</b>ttMail.  It was called mail.

<b>ttttNELSON
</b>ttt(fondly nostalgic and kidding
ttt it slightly)
ttStamps.  Envelopes.

</b>ttWait.  I've heard of it.  It was a means
ttof communication before I was born.

<b>ttttNELSON
</b>ttExactly.

<b>ttttSCHUYLER
</b>ttCecilia had beautiful penmanship.
ttShe was too young for me, but she was...
ttenchanting.  Her daughter owns it now.

<b>ttttNELSON
</b>ttToo bad for her.

tAs a DECORATOR walks into the office carrying a pile of
tupholstered pillows, and Joe turns to look at them.

<b>ttttCOMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
</b>ttWelcome.  You've got mail.

</b>ttWhat if they put us out of business?

tof a New York publishing house called Eden Books, is standing
tat a podium at a sales conference.  In the audience are sales

tpictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks.

ttt     PATRICIA (cont'd)
ttAnd now, the book you've all been waiting
ttfor, the book it's been my dreams to
ttpublish.  The legendary Veronica Grant
tthas written her memoirs --

tThere's a burst of applause as a photograph of Veronica Grant
tflashes on screen.

ttt     PATRICIA (cont'd)
tt-- and I'm happy to report it is just
ttcrammed with tragedy.

ttJust kidding, but seriously, it's all
tthere: poverty, addiction, divorce,

tWe see pictures of Veronica at eight with her sharecropper
tfamily, Veronica at 14 with her first child, Veronica with a
tseries of husbands, Veronica in a wheelchair, etc.

tt-- her third husband beat her up, hip

ttwhere all the injected fat fell to her

tNow we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of
tVeronica on it and the title: "Am I Rising from Ashes, or Did
tI Just Forget to Dust?"

ttt     PATRICIA (cont'd)
ttThis book is fabulous.  And even if it
ttweren't, it would sell like crazy,
ttbecause Veronica is going to plug it to
ttdeath on every talk show in America.
ttThis book...

tPatricia bursts into tears.

ttt     PATRICIA (cont'd)
ttI'm sorry.  I can't talk about it without
ttcrying.  Veronica and I have so much in
ttcommon -- well, not all the sad parts --
ttbut we were both famous by the time we
ttwere 29 and, believe me, that's rough.
ttt(wipes her nose with a Kleenex,
ttt pulling herself together)
ttAnyway, I just want to say that I'm

ttVeronica lives in my building and we met
