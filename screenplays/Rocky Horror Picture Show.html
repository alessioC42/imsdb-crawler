tttTo the late night double feature

tThe SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the IMAGE EXPANDS TO 
tWIDE-SCREEN.  The STILL FRAME bursts to life as the doors of the Denton 
tCatholic Church are flung open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds 
tfrom the church organ.

tThe young married couple, RALPH and BETTY HAPSCHATT appear followed by a 
tcrowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting 
texcitedly.

tThe MINISTER shakes RALPH by the hand while RALPH slips him a $20 bill.

tPHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures.

tBRAD MAJORS, a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his mid-

thands.

</b>tttWell Brad, I guess we made it huh!

<b>tttttBRAD
</b>tttWell I don't think there was any doubt
tttabout that - You and Betty have been

tttin on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.

</b>tttTell you the truth Brad, she was the

</b>tttYes, Janet and I are both fond of him.
tttWe drove over to see him last vacation.

tThe GUESTS cheer.

</b>tttWho knows...ha ha.

tRALPH & BETTY drive off.  GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD & JANET with great 
tenthusiasm.  GUESTS begin to disperse.

tJANET & BRAD linger outside the church.  So do a strange FAMILY :  An 
told man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter.  They resemble the 
tQuaker family in "American Gothic", a painting.

tThe MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church 
tdoors.  Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside.  The FAMILY, and the 
tMINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we 
tshall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place.

tttttJANET (who is holding the bouquet)
tttOh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't
tttBetty look radiantly beautiful.  
tttJust an hour ago she was plain old

tballroom.  At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding 
tit, a theatre proscenium.  In the body of the room are GUESTS.  They are 
tthe people BRAD and JANET passed on the road.  They are the 
tTransylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from 
tall over the earth.  It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - 
tannounced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom.  They are
tall dressed in strange but elegant evening wear.  They are a distorted 
tversion of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding.  A party spirit prevails, 
tthey throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.

tThe laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating 
ttheatre and a Greek gymnasium.  It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the 
tlift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which
tthough screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of 
tROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised 
tdias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the 
toperational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator.  A chandelier 
thangs above the tank.

tOn the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone.  
tNear the podium are some weights.  Behind the tank is a vaulting horse.
tThese are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents.

tThe GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives.

tFRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room.  RIFF 
tRAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he
thands to FRANK.

tttand hands them to Brad).

tMAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the podium.

tttttFRANK (continues)
tttIt's not often we receive visitors here.
tttLet alone offer them hospitality.

tttttBRAD (Moving towards Frank)
tttHospitality!  All we wanted to do was

tttwhich you have chosen to ignore.

tttttJANET (Hurring after Brad)
tttDon't be ungrateful Brad.

tttttBRAD (Stepping closer to Frank)
tttUngrateful!

tThe room falls silent.  All eyes are on FRANK, waiting for his reaction.  
tA smile breaks on his face.

</b>tttHow forceful you are Brad.  Such a

tMAGENTA & COLUMBIA laugh.

tttYou must be awfully proud of him Janet.

</b>tttCertainly not!

</b>tttOh well.  How about you.  (He laughs)

tRIFF RAFF has approached behind FRANK, looming over his shoulder.

<b>tttttRIFF RAFF
</b>tttEverything is in readiness, Master.
tttWe merely await your word.

tFRANK drinks his champagne then hands RIFF RAFF the empty glass.  RIFF

</b>tttTonight...One, one, one.  Can you hear

</b>tttTonight you are to witness a breakthrough

tThere is a gasp from COLUMBIA, MAGENTA and GUESTS.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttAnd paradise is to be mine.

tGUESTS and everybody applaud.  JANET claps too, but BRAD indicates that 
tshe shouldn't.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttIt was strange the way it happened.
tttOne of those quirks of fate really.  
tttOne of those moments when you seem

tttin his hand)  All the pieces seem to 
tttfit into place.  What a sucker you'r

tttto make it happen.  An accident!

tMAGENTA & COLUMBIA step forward one each side of him.

tttttMAGENTA & COLUMBIA (softly)
tttAn accident.

tttttFRANK (Moving to tank)
tttYou see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate.
tttFor tonight is the night that my beautiful

tEverybody applauds.  FRANK then pulls the cover from the tank.  RIFF 
tRAFF is at the control panel.

tRIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel.

<b>tttttFRANK
</b>tttAnd step up the reactor power input 
tttthree more points.

tRIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel.

tFRANK watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is 
tlowered.  It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank.

tThe liquids bubble and change colour.  The thing inside begins to look 
tlike a human form.

tThe liquids drain away.  The form begins to move.

tFRANK climbs the ladder at one end of the tank, RIFF RAFF the other.

tROCKY HORROR sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both 
tarms outstretched.

tRIFF RAFF removes the bandage from ROCKY's head.  ROCKY looks at RIFF 
tRAFF then at FRANK.  With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above.

tAt the same time RIFF RAFF is down the ladder making for the handle.  He 
twinds up the chandelier and ROCKY.

tAs ROCKY gets level with him, FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the 
ttank....because...

tROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between MAGENTA and 
tCOLUMBIA who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip
this arm and leg bandages.

tttttScript AmendmentstttSeptember 12, 1974
<b>ttttt-----------------
</b>
The following alterations involve discrepancies between the original 
screenplay and current script revisions and design decisions.

1/2tThe film will now commence in Black and White on "ACADEMY"
tformat.  It will extend to wide screen (1.1 - 85) at
tSequence 41, while still remaining in black and white.  At
tSequence 54 the film changes to colour.

15tNow read "Denton Episcopalian Church".

23tBrad and Janet will arrive at the gate entrance to Oakley Court.
tThis deletes a later reference to gates in 33.  From hereon ignore
tall references to rock formations etc., as the grounds of
tOakley Court are the only location involved in the approach to the
thouse.

25tThree motorbikes drive past Brad and disappear around the house.

26tThis window will be in turret in Oakley Court.  Ignore all
treferences to adjoining 'massive lighted window'.

30tThis shot will be of a Gryphem on the Oakley Court facade.

32tThis will be of some similar detail to the above.

38t"Stairway" references now allude to the front entrance hall of
tOakley Court.

40tDelete references to "mirrors reflecting to infinity".

47tColumbia now is astride a Juke Box.  The band are cut.

54atRed streamers and Black and White balloons fall.  Not just
tstreamers.

69tAll future references to the operating table in the Lab now
tshould be applied either to the TANK or the vaulting horse
t(part of the gymnasium equipment) - whichever is applicable.

75tDelete references to the Ice-block.  Eddie now crashes
tthrough a wall of Coca Cola bottles and ice.  He is also equipped
twith a saxaphone rather than a guitar.

87atRocky now escapes through the lift shaft.  This may involve
ta shot from the vestibule showing Rocky climbing out of lift
tcage and running out of the house.  It may also involve the
tdouble bed in the bridal suite collapsing during the escape
tsequence.

91tIt is still raining.

92tJanet is now stumbling around the staircase in Oakley Court.

103tThis sequence may now also involve Riff-Raff, Magenta,
tColumbia, Frank, Brad and selected Transylvanians.

106tWill now have Frank, Riff-Raff, and Brad entering the Lab
tin the lift cage.

108tIt is still raining.

116tDr Scott will now break through the tiled wall of the laboratory
ton the area of ramp above the control panel.

117tMagenta will now appear through the broken tile area created
tby Dr Scott.

122/140 This sequence will be altered to Dr Scott holding a
tphotograph album containing a still photograph equivalent
tof the "flashbacks" referred to in this sequence.

143/4tAll entrances to the Lab will be via the broken tiled entrance.

tDelete all references to the floor lowering.

As scripted up to;  What further indignities were they
to be subjected to?

Then please add:tAnd what of the floor show that had been

What diabolical plan had seized Frank's crazed imagination?
What indeed?  From what had gone before it was clear that
this was to be no picnic.
