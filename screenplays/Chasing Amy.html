<b>tINT. COMIC BOOK STORE - DAY
</b>tA pile of COMIC BOOKS are on a shelf next to myriad 
tothers. The most prominent one is called x11BLUNTMAN AND 
tCHRONIC'.  A hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame.
tHOLDEN opens the comic and flips through it He shakes his 
thead.  BANKY looks over his shoulder.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttFelt Like this fucking day would never 
tttcome.  Issue two - on the shelf.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYippee.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttDon't start, alright!  This is a cool 
tttmoment, and I'd appreciate you not 
ttttrying to ruin it.  How often doestt
ttta guy get the opportunity to purchase 
tttsomething with his name on it!
tttt(points to name on cover)
tttBanky Edwards- right!
tttt(points to the other)
tttHolden McNeil.
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI know my name.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttC'mon, sour puss.  We got the rest of 
tttour lives to be artists.  But it's 
tttsupply and demand.  And right now,tt
tttthe unwashed masses demand this.
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(off comic)
tttThis is easy, alright!  And right now 
tttit pays the bills.  Just don't forget 
tttthat we're better than this.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttI'll tell you who we're better than: 
tttthese two fags right here.
tThey approach the counter, where STEVE-DAVE, the store 
tmanager, and WALT the Fan-boy, play a card game.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(lays books on the counter)
tttAlright Old-Maid's - take a break from 
tttthe Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up.
<b>tttttSTEVE-DAVE
</b>tttt(not looking up)
tttWell, well,well, Walt Did you see who 
tttit is!  The local celebrities.  Quick - 
tttget them to autograph one of their 
tttbooks so we can sell it for triple 
tttit's value.
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttI'm not that in need of fifteen cents 
tttright now.
tThey snicker and high-five one another.  Holden rolls his 
teyes.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttYou guys operate the smallest, ladies' 
tttbridge circle I've ever seen.
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttFor your information, we're playing 
tttx11Crimson Mystical Mages' - an 
tttoverpower card game. Not that either 
tttof you would give a shit about 
tttsomething as advancedtas this - 
tttthere are no dick or poopie jokes 
tttinvolved.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(to Holden)
tttI don't think they're fans.
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttNo, we're not.  You're both a couple 
tttof fucking no talents that got lucky.
<b>tttttSTEVE-DAVE
</b>tttAnd obviously your handlers or hangers-
ttton convinced you that your first comic 
tttwas good which it was not it was 
tttthoroughly mediocre with a few spiky 
tttbits of dialogue.  And when you get 
tttyour foot in the door of the business, 
tttwhat do you do!  You turn out a piece 
tttof shit like x11Bluntman and Chronic'.
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttTell him, Steve-Dave.
<b>tttttSTEVE-DAVE
</b>tttt(off comic)
tttx11Bluntman and Chronic'.  Pah.  
tttWhat was that thing the little stoner 
tttpulled on the villain in the last 
tttissue!
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttThe Stinky-palm.
<b>tttttSTEVE-DAVE
</b>tttStinky-palm.  You give comics a bad 
tttname I tell all my customers not to 
tttbuy it, to spend their money on a real 
tttcomic book.
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttFucking one hit wonder, dime-store 
tttFrank Miller's.
<b>tttttSTEVE-DAVE
</b>tttThis is the reality at Comic-Toast - 
tttyou're not going to get your ass 
tttkissed here, because both me and Walt 
tttthink you suck.
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttAnd me.
<b>tttttSTEVE-DAVE
</b>tttI said that.
tSteve-Dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then 
tgoes back to playing his game with Walt.  Holden and 
tBanky stare, shocked.  Banky nudges Holden and they both 
texit Steve-Dave and the Fan-boy slap hands and go back to 
tplaying.
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttI've got a dragon card - forty power-
tttups and twelve life points!  Ha!  I 
tttget your elf card!
<b>tttttSTEVE-DAVE
</b>tttYou're such a bitch!  But thankfully, 
tttI've saved a dark forces Shaman card 
tttfor just such an occasion.
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttYou suck!  Eighty six life-power 
tttpoints to my twenty two!
<b>tttttSTEVE-DAVE
</b>tttI schooled their asses, now I'm 
tttschooling your's.
tSuddenly.  A trash can crashes through the front window. 
tSteve-Dave and Walt hit the deck like bitches, covering 
tone another.  They look up slowly. Steve-Dave leaps to 
this feet and looks at the shattered mess.  He pulls 
tsomething off the garbage can and reads it.
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttYou know it was those two fucks!  
tttLet's call the cops and have them 
tttbusted!  I know where their studio is!  
tttOr better yet, let's sue!  You can sue 
tttthem, Steve-Dave!
<b>tttttSTEVE-DAVE
</b>tttt(still reading note)
tttThat won't be necessary.
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttWhat?!  Why the hell not!
<b>tttttSTEVE-DAVE
</b>tttt(holds up check)
tttBecause this is a check for three 
ttttimes what that window cost.
tttt(reading note)
tttx13Dear critics - thanks for the 
tttinsight. But like my grandmother 
tttalways said - x11Fuck 'em if they can't 
ttttake a joke.. and break their window.'  
tttKiss it,ttBanky the Hack. 
tttP.S. - Your card game blows.x14
<b>tttttWALT
</b>tttHe said x13Kiss itx14!
<b>tCREDITS
</b><b>tINT. COMIC BOOK: CONVENTION SIGNING BOOTH - DAY
</b>tA physically large FAN - sweaty brow, tote bag bursting 
twith comics - leans forward, smiling.
<b>tttttFAN
</b>tttCould you sign it x13To a really big 
tttfanx14!
tHolden sits at a table.  Across from the barely-managing-
tto-stand Fan.  He offers him a patronizingly kind, half-
tsmile in return,
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYou bet.
tWe're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book-
tsigning. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding 
tHOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS -
tCREATORS OF x11BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'. Beside it is a large 
tmock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner 
tsuper-heroes who bear a
tstriking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly 
tneighborhood drug
tdealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan.
<b>tttttFAN
</b>tttI love this book man!  This shit's 
tttawesome.  I wish I was like these guys 
ttt- getting stoned, talking all raw 
tttaboutttchicks and fighting 
tttsupervillains!  I love these guys!  
tttThey're like x11Cheech and Chong' meet 
tttx11Bill and fed'!
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI like to chink of them as 
tttx11Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet 
tttx11Vladimir and Estragon'.
<b>tttttFAN
</b>tttYeah!
tttt(beat)
tttWho!
tBANKY signs the book of another COLLECTOR.
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttSo you draw this!
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(signing the comic)
tttI ink it and I'm also the colorist.  
tttThe guy next to me draws it.  But we 
tttboth came up with the characters,
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttWhat's that mean - you x11ink it'!
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWell.  It means that Holden draws the 
tttpictures in pencil, and then he gives 
tttit to me to go over in ink
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttSo you just trace!
tBanky freezes up.  He composes himself and continues 
tsigning.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttIt's not tracing.  I add depth and 
tttshading to give the image mere 
tttdefinition. Only then does the drawingt
tttreally take shape.
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttYou go over what he draws with a pen - 
tttthat's tracing.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(hands book back to 
ttttCollector)
tttNot really.
tttt(calling out)
tttNext!
tA LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers.
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttHey man.  If somebody draws something 
tttand then you draw the same thing right 
ttton top of it, not going out-side the 
tttdesignated original art what do call 
tttthat!
<b>tttttLITTLE KID
</b>tttt(shrugs)
tttI don't know.  Tracing?
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttt(to Banky)
tttSee?
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttIt's not tracing.
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttOh, but it is.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(to Little Kid)
tttDo you want Lour book signed or what?
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttHey - don't get all testy with him 
tttjust because you have a problem with 
tttyour station in life.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttI'm secure with what I do.
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttThen say it - you're a tracer.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(grabbing Little Kid's book)
tttHow should I sign this?
<b>tttttLITTLE KID
</b>tttt(grabs book back)
tttI don't want you to sign it, I want 
tttthe guy that draws Bluntman and 
tttChronic to sign it.  You're just a 
ttttracer.
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttTell him, Little Shaver.
tHolden accepts a comic from another Fan.
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(off comic)
tttWho do I sign it to!
tBefore Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard.  He 
tlooks to his left and freaks.
tBanky is throttling the Collector from across the table. 
tThe Collector attempts to fight him off.  SECURITY GUARDS 
tpull them apart. Holden grabs Banky.
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttJesus!  All I did was call him a 
ttttracer!
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(to Collector)
<b>tttI'LL TRACE A CHALK LINE AROUND YOUR 
</b><b>tttDEAD FUCKING BODY, YOU FUCK?!
</b><b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(to Security Guard)
tttCould you get him out of here!
tThe Security Guards drag the collector away.
<b>tttttCOLLECTOR
</b>tttHey, wait a sec!  He jumped me!  And 
tttyou're dragging me away!!
tttt(exiting)
tttFucking tracer!
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(calling OC)
<b>tttYOUR MOTHER'S A TRACER!!
</b><b> 
</b><b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttCan I explain the audience principle 
tttto you!  If you insult and accost 
tttthem, then we have no audience.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttHe started it!  Fucking cock-knocker! 
tttHe's lucky I didn't put my pen through 
ttthis thorax!
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttNeed I remind you...
tttt(holds up watch)
tttCurtain's in ten minutes.
<b>tINT. COMIC BOOK CONVENTION LECTURE HALL - DAY
</b>tHOOPER fills the frame.  He comes off like a typical, pro-
tblack/anti-white homeboy.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttFor years in this industry whenever an 
tttAfrican-American character - hero or 
tttvillain - was introduced usually by 
tttwhite artists and writers - they got 
tttslapped with racist names that singled 
tttthem out as negroes: Black Panther, 
tttBlack Lightning, Black Goliath, Blackt
tttMantra, Black Talon, Black Spider, 
tttBlack Hand, Black Falcon, Black Cat..
<b>tttttVOICE FROM CROWD
</b>tttShe's white.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttShe is?
tttt(beat)
tttWell bust this - regardless.
tWe're at a panel discussion.  The room is full.  Five 
tcreators sit at a long table, their names on placards in 
tfront of them.  
t(One of them is a very striking Girl.)  The banner behind 
tthem reads x11WORDS UP - MINORITY VOICES IN COMICS'.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttt(holds up comic)
tttNow my book, x11White-Hating Coon', 
tttdoesn't have any of that bullshit. The 
ttthero's name is Maleekwa, and he's at
tttdescendant of the black tribe that 
tttestablished the first society on the 
tttplanet, while all you European mothert
tttfuckers were still hiding in caves and 
tttshit, all terrified of the sun. He's a 
tttstrong role model that a young blackt
tttreader can look up to, x11Cause I'm here 
tttto tell you - the chickens are comin' 
ttthome to roost, ya'll: the black man'st
tttno longer gonna play the minstrel in 
tttthe medium of comics and Sci-
tttFi/Fantasy!  We're keeping it real, 
tttand we're gonna get respect - 
tttby any means necessary!
tDuring the speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up 
tfront.
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(calling out)
tttBullshit!  Lando Calrissian was a 
tttblack man, and he got to fly the 
tttMillennium Falcon!
tHooper whips his head around, looking for the source of 
tthe comment
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttWho said that?!?
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(standing)
tttI did!  Lando Calrissian is a positive 
tttblack role model in the realm of 
tttScience Fiction/Fantasy.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttFuck Lando Calrissian!  Uncle Tom 
tttnigger!  Always some white boy gotta 
tttinvoke x11the holy trilogy'! Bust this - 
tttthose movies are about how the white 
tttman keeps the brother man down - even 
tttin a galaxy far, far away.  Checktt
tttthis shit.  You got cracker farm-boy 
tttLuke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy - 
tttblond hair, blue eyes.  
tttAnd then you've gotttDarth 
tttVader: the blackest brother in the 
tttgalaxy.  Nubian God.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWhat's a Nubian?
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttShut the fuck up!  Now Vader, he's a 
tttspiritual brother, with the force and 
tttall that shit.  Then this cracker 
tttSkywalker gets his hands on a light-
tttsaber, and the boy decides he'stt
tttgonna run the fucking universe - gets 
ttta whole Klan of whites together, and 
tttthey're gonna bust up Vader's x11hoodtt
tttthe Death Star.  Now what the fuck do 
tttyou call that!
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttIntergalactic Civil War!
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttGentrification.  They're gonna drive 
tttour the black element, to make the 
tttgalaxy quote, unquote x11safe' for white 
tttfolks.
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttBut Vader turns, out to be Luke's 
tttfather.  And in Jedi, they become 
tttfriends.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttDon't make me bust a cap in your ass, 
tttyo!  Jedi's the most insulting 
tttinstallment, because Vader's 
tttbeautiful,ttblack visage is 
tttsullied when he pulls off his mask to 
tttreveal a feeble, crusty white man! 
tttThey're trying to tell us that deep 
tttinside, we all want to be white!
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWell isn't that true!
tHooper explodes, He pulls a nine millimeter from his 
tbelt, draws on Banky and fires.  Banky goes down, falling 
tforward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to 
tscatter, Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists 
tin the air.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b><b>tttBLACK RAGE! BLACK RAGE!!  I'LL KILL 
</b><b>tttANY WHITE FOLKS I LAY MY MOTHER 
</b><b>tttFUCKIN' EYES ON!!!
</b>tThe crowd-is gone.  Holden sits in his chair, laughing. 
tHooper steps off the stage and picks Banky's head up off 
tthe floor.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttt(breaking character)
tttx11What's a Nubian!'  Bitch, you almost 
tttmade me laugh!
tHooper sounds different Actually, he sounds gay.  
tActually - he is.  Banky smiles.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWell what about you!  You didn't tell 
tttme you were going to scream x11Black 
tttRage'.  I nearly pissed myself.
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttHow do you manage to get away with 
tttthis all the time?  Shouldn't cops be 
tttbusting your head open right about 
tttnow?
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWrong coast.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttt(off gun)
tttWell this right here - she full of 
tttblanks, okay.  And Opiate gets all 
tttsorts of legal clearances before I go 
ttton.
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYour publisher condones these 
ttttheatrics!
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttCondones?  Honey, they insist.  I need 
tttto sell the image to sell the book 
tttWould the audience still buy the 
tttx11Black Rage' angle if they found out 
tttthe book was written by a.. a...
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttFaggot.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttWhen you say if it sounds so sexy...
tttt(he kisses Banky full on the 
ttttlips)
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(wipes his lips)
tttHey, hey!  I'll play your victim, but 
tttnot your catcher.
<b>tttttVOICE
</b>tttHow is it that you sound like Minister 
tttFarakhan when you're on stage..
tThey turn to see...
tA beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel swinging her 
tpurse in a circle. Her name is ALYSSA.  She's the 
tstriking Girl from the panel who didn't get to say much.
<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>ttt...and the King of Pop when you're 
tttnor.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttLook out, boys - this kitten has a 
tttwhip.
<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(shoves and slaps him)
tttAlways before I get to speak!  I swear 
ttt- the next con I attend and they ask 
tttme to be on the minority panel, if I 
tttsee your name anywhere near the List, 
tttI'm passing.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttt(defending himself)
tttHolden.  Banky - this pile of P.M.S. 
tttis Alyssa Jones.  She does that book 
tttx11Idiosyncratic Routine'.  This is the 
tttfourth panel we've been on together, 
tttand even though she knows my publisher 
tttsets this up and pays for the event. 
tttShe still gets mad when it ends with 
tttmy act.
<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI just wish I was the one who gets to 
tttshoot you.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttThat's what my father said when I came 
ttt- nay - leapt out of the closet
tttt(off guys)
tttThese boys do x11Bluntman and Chronic', 
tttwhich outsells both of our books put 
ttttogether, hence they're never on a 
tttpanel with the likes of us.  They 
tttslumming right now.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttI've read your book.  It's cute.  
tttChick stuff, but cute.
tHolden hits him.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWhat?
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(shoots him a look; to 
ttttAlyssa)
tttSorry about him.  He's dealing with 
tttbeing an inker.
<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(to Banky)
tttOh. You trace!
tBanky seethes.
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(shaking her hand)
tttI really enjoy your book I'm surprised 
tttwe've never met at any other Con's 
tttbefore.
<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttLose the dick or change your skin tone 
tttand we can get to know each other on 
tttpanel after panel while the Pink Black 
tttPanther here plays Chuck D. for the 
tttfanboys.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttHey, jealousy.
tttt(to the Boys)
tttI told Alyssa I'd buy her a post-rave 
tttdrink.  Do the Garden-Staters have to 
tttsprint to the Lincoln Tunnel, or can 
tttyou stay for a round in the big, scary 
tttcity!
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWe're gonna take off soon...
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWe'll go.
tBanky offers Holden a puzzled glance.  Then he nods to 
tHooper.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWe'll go.
<b>tINT BAR - NIGHT
</b>tHolden, Banky, Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table 
tdrinking, talking, and smoking.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttArchie, alright!  Archie and the 
tttRiverdale gang were a pure and fun-
tttlovin' bunch.  You can't find 
tttdysfunction in those comics, because 
tttthey were just flat out wholesome.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttArchie and Jughead were lovers.
tttt(sips his drink)
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttShut the fuck up.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttIt's true.  Archie was the bitch and 
tttJughead was the butch - that's why 
tttJughead wears that crown-looking hat 
tttall the time: he the king, of queen 
tttArchie's world.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttMan, I feel a hate-crime coming on
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttHe's got a point.  Archie never did 
tttsettle on Betty or Veronica.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttBecause he wanted them both at the 
tttsame time, you assholes!  He never 
tttchose one because he was trying to get 
tttboth of them into a three-way!
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttt(pulls out a dollar and hands 
ttttit to Banky)
tttHere.  I want you to go down to the 
tttcorner store and buy yourself a clue. 
tttGo on.
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttEat it.  Urkel.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttI told you to watch it with that Urkel

<b>tttttBANKY

tttThat's it.  You.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttMoi?
<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttYou are marching back across the 
tttstreet with me, and we're going to 
tttpick up a shit load of Archie books, I 
tttam going to prove to you - beyond the 
tttshadow of a doubt that Archie was all 
tttabout pussy.  Come on.
<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttt(sliding out of booth)
tttThis boy is conflicted, I shall play 
tttmother-therapist for him.  You two sit 
ttttight.  We shall return promptly.
tBanky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at 
tthe table.
<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttIs he always Like that!
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttFor years now.  Started back in third 
tttgrade - a nun was teaching us about 
tttthe Blessed Trinity.  She's going on 
tttabout the three persons in one God 
tttthing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and 
ttthe just goes ballistic.  I guess it 
tttwas too big for him to grasp.  They 
tttgot into this huge fight.
<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttPlease.  How bad could it have been!
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYou ever seen a nun call a small child 
ttta x11fucking cunt-rag'?  Wasn't pretty, 
tttShit like that's bound to happen when 
tttyou make a kid wear a matching tie and 
tttslacks everyday.
<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttAnd your parochial school 
tttmisadventures!
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttLimited to wine-tasting prior to mass. 
tttTurned me into a grade school 
tttalcoholic altar boy.  I couldn't tell 
tttyou how many mornings after serous 
tttbendersttI'd wake up next 
tttto strange priests.
<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttAren't you the sharp wit!
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttSharp!  No.  I'm just a fan of clergy-
tttmolestation humor.  Probably why the 
tttextended family quit inviting me to 
tttFirst Communion parties.
tAlyssa laughs.  Holden smiles.
<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(looking OC)
tttYou play darts!
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttNot professionally.  You know - only 
tttin bars.



<b>tAT THE DART BOARD
</b>
tA dart hits the board then, one hits the wall beside the 
tboard.

tAlyssa winds up with another dart.  Holden watches. Her's 
talways hit. His never do.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttSo your new book seems to be selling 
tttlike mad.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttIt goes back to something my 
tttgrandmother told me when I was a kid. 
ttt"Holden," she said "The big bucks are 
tttin dick and fart jokes."  She was a 
tttchurch-goer.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttUh-oh - the cry from the heart of a 
tttreal artist trapped in commercial hell 
ttt- pitying his good fortune.  I'm sure 
tttyou can dry your eyes on all those fat 
tttchecks you rake in.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI'm sorry - did I detect a note of 
tttbitter envy in there!

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttNope.  I'm happy my stuff gets read at 
tttall.  There's very little market for 
ttthearts and flowers in this spandex-
tttclad, big pecs, big tits, big guns 
tttfield.  If I sell two issues, I feel 
tttlike John Grisham.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(looking out window)
tttIt's all about marketing.  Over- or 
tttunderweight guys who don't get laid - 
tttthey're our bread and butter.  People 
tttlike those two outside should be 
tttyours.

tThrough the window, we see a COUPLE making out on the 
thood of a car.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttAnd sadly, there are more of our core 
tttaudience out there than yours.
tttt(smiles)
tttLook at that, though - kind of gives 
tttyou a little charge, to see two people 
tttin love.  And all over Banky's car, no 
tttless.  That car's seeing more action 
tttright now than it's seen in years.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttBubbly guy like that, it's hard to 
tttfigure out why.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(still looking at OC Couple)
tttYou've gotta respect that kind of 
tttdisplay of affection.  It's crazy, 
tttrude, self-absorbed - but it's love.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttThat's not love.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttSays you.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttThat out there!  That's fleeting.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttFleeting.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttUh-huh.  You wanna hear about love!  
tttOh, I'll tell you about love.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttA story?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttThe story.  The original love story.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>ttt'Doctor Zhivago'.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttNope.  My mother's uncle.  He was a 
tttmillionaire.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttGet out.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI kid you not.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttExplain.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttAll through high school, he dated this 
tttone girl.  They  were inseparable.  
tttAnd when they graduated, she went off 
tttto Carnegie Mellon...

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttIn Pittsburgh.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI'm impressed.  So he stays in the 
ttthome town, and they begin their long-
tttdistance relationship.  The plan is, 
ttton the  third Sunday of every month, 
ttthe'll train out, spend a week then 
ttttrain back They do this for four 
tttyears.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttThat is love.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttNot nearly finished.  Two months 
tttbefore she's going to graduate, he's 
tttgot this job digging graves, and he 
tttcomes across...

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttA stiff.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttA steamer trunk containing silver 
tttingots.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttGet out of here.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttMany, many silver ingots.  Now, my 
tttmother's uncle being quite the 
tttingenious chap - he buries the trunk  
tttagain and heads up to the main office, 
tttwhere he proceeds to purchase a 
tttcemetery plot.  Guess which one?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttClever.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttSo now he owns the plot and all of its 
tttcontents.  Two  days later, my 
tttmother's uncle is worth three million.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttAt which time he marries the high 
tttschool sweetheart and lives happily 
tttever after.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttNot even close.  Inside the steamer 
ttttrunk, stenciled into the wood, or 
tttsomething like that, is a curse.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttSomeone wrote 'Fuck' inside his new 
tttsteamer trunk.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttNot that kind of curse.  A cryptic 
tttcurse "Great fortune means great loss" 
tttit said.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWhat kind of asshole writes that 
tttinside a steamer trunk!

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttThe same kind of asshole that buries 
tttsilver ingots.  The day my mother's 
tttuncle is heading out to see the girl, 
ttthe stops at his accountant's to grab 
tttsome cash, and winds up missing his 
ttttrain.  So he has to take the next one 
ttt- which he does - and he gets there an 
ttthour later than his usual time of 
tttarrival, whereupon he sees lights.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttA hero's welcome for the new 
tttmillionaire.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttIt seems that while she was standing 
ttton the platform waiting that extra 
ttthour for my mother's uncle to show up, 
tttthe girl was dragged into the bushes 
tttby an unknown assailant, raped and 
tttgutted.

tHolden is silent Alyssa downs her drink.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttThe assailant was never apprehended.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(beat)
tttThat's a love story!!

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttYes, and here's why: my mother's uncle 
tttrode that train every day for the rest 
tttof his life.  One day up, the next day 
tttback.  Did that 'till the day he died.  
tttHe donated the fortune he'd acquired 
tttto the train station in Pittsburgh, to 
ttthave a well-lit terminal built.  
tttThe train line let him ride for free 
tttafter that.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI should hope so.  Jesus, that's the 
tttsaddest tale I've ever heard.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttThat's my love story.

tAlyssa tosses her last dart.  Holden seems a bit dazed.  
tHe looks out the window.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttThose two aren't on the hood of 
tttBanky's car anymore.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI told you It wasn't love.
tttt(grabs her purse)
tttI gotta split.  It was really nice 
tttmeeting you.  I wish you the best of 
tttluck with your book.
tttt(shakes his hand)
tttTell Hooper I'll call him later.  And 
ttttell your friend to calm down.

tAlyssa exits to the night.  Holden stares after her.  Two 
tbeats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an 
t'Everything's Archie' comic between them.

</b>tttWho?

</b>tttMiss Alyssa Jones.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttShe's alright.

</b>tttAs long as that's all.
tttt(finishes drink)
tttMaybe you can convince that partner of 
tttyour's to drop me off downtown before

tttMister Weatherbee wasn't really trying 
tttto fuck Archie, was he!

tThey begin exiting.

</b>tttHell no.  Weatherbee was Reggie's 
tttbitch.



<b>tINT. STUDIO - DAY
</b>
tWe're in Holden and Banky's studio/apartment.  It's a 
trented loft-style place with high ceilings, wood floors 
tand sparse furnishings.  There are posters on the walls, 
ta sort of kitchenette, a hockey net, a big TV. (with all 
tthe trimmings - VCR, Laserdisc player, Sega, SNES), a 
thuge comfy couch, and two drawing boards with adjacent 
tdesks (littered with pencils, pens, coloring pencils,

tThey're working.  Some music plays.

tdraws.

tswinging from a street light.

tThe two work in silence.  Then...

tBanky offers a mocking mimic of his smile.

tThe band starts playing.  Cross cutting begins.

tAlyssa launches into a torchy tune.  The song is 
textremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making 
tdirect eye contact with...

tHolden.  Or does she!  Holden is smiling, being seduced,  
tBanky rolls his eyes.  Beside Holden, stands a pretty 
tGIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's 
tperformance.

tAlyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out 
tthere.  
tThe song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at.  
tIt's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur 
tof whom!  At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but 
tAlyssa's preoccupied.  She points to someone in the 
tcrowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion, 
turging whoever it is to join her.  She jumps off the 
tstage.

tHolden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw-
tshucks style.  At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps 
tforward.  Banky's eyes widen.  Holden looks up and is 
tsuddenly taken aback.

tAlyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall 
tinto a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss.

tHolden's eyes bug.  Banky allows a smile to creep across 
this face.  The crowd applauds.  Banky looks around, and 
tfor the first time, we get the distinct impression that 
tthis is a lesbian bar...

tThere are a lot of chicks in this place.  Gay chicks.  
tBanky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back.

</b>tttSure.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttSo for you, to 'fuck' means to 
tttpenetrate.  You're used to the more 
ttttraditional definition - you inside 
tttsome girl you've duped, jack-hammering 
tttaway, not noticing that bored look in 
ttther eyes.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttHey - I always notice the bored look 
tttin their eyes.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(laughs)
ttt'Fucking' is nor limited to 
tttpenetration, Banky. For me it 
tttdescribes any sex when it's not 
ttttotally about love.  I don't love Kim, 
tttbut I'll fuck her.  I'm sure you don't 
tttlove every girl you sleep with.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttSome of them I downright loathe.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttBut I'll bet it's different with the 
tttones you love.  I'll bet you go the 
tttfull nine when it's not just a quick 
tttfix - like you go down on them longer 
tttor something.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttHere we go.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttI don't do that.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttWhat?!?!

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttI stopped dropping.  It got to be too 
tttfrustrating.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttAs stupid as you usually come off 
tttduring this diatribe of your's, you're 
tttgoing to come off ten times as stupid 
ttton this occasion.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWhat?!  I lost my tolerance for the 
tttbullshit baggage that comes with 
ttteating girls out.  What's the big 
tttdeal?!

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttIf you say the smell, so help me, I'll 
tttslug you.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttNot the smell - the smell is good.  
tttI'm talking about not being able to do 
tttit property.  And my mother brought me 
tttup to believe that if I can't do 
tttsomething
tttright I shouldn't do it at all.  Of 
tttcourse, my father told me she gave 
tttlousy head, but that's beside the 
tttpoint.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttAt least you blame yourself for your 
tttsexual inadequacies.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttNo, I blame them.  Chicks never help 
tttyou out.  They never tell you what to 
tttdo.  And most of them are self-
tttconscious about that smell factor, and 
tttso most of the time they just lay 
tttthere, frozen like a deer in the 
tttheadlights, right?  Not for nothing, 
tttbut when a chick goes down on me.  I 
tttlet her know where to go, and what the 
tttstatus is.  You gotta handle it like 
tttCNN and the Weather Channel - constant 
tttupdates.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYou're such an idiot.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttNo, he's got a point.  That's how I 
tttwas in high school - I was nervous, 
tttand inhibited about being eaten out.  
tttBut by the time I got to college, that 
tttall changed.  I loosened up.  Not only 
tttdid I learn to communicate - I learned 
tttto be bossy.  
tttI was like one of those guys at the 
tttairport with those big flash lights - 
tttwaving them this way, directing them 
tttthat way, telling them when to stop.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttAnd that's all I'm saying, it'd be 
tttdifferent if chicks helped out - 
tttpointed a guy in the right direction.  
tttThen there'd be no bullshit, no wasted 
ttttime, and no chance for permanent 
tttinjuries.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttPermanent injuries?

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttSure.  You wanna see something 
tttpermanent!
tttt(pulls our front tooth)
tttI got this from Nina Rollins, 
tttsophomore year.  I'm going down on 
ttther, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps 
ttton her stomach.  She does this big ol' 
tttpelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in 
ttthalf, sends it down my throat.  I had 
tttto get a crown for the stub.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(to Holden)
tttI got that beat.
tttt(to Banky)
tttI got that beat.
tttt(half-turns and lifts chin)
tttSophomore year.  I'm going down on 
tttCynthia Slater in her dorm room after 
tttwe went club-hopping.  I'm totally 
tttdrunk, and in the middle of it, I fall 
tttasleep - right there in her lap.  She 
tttgot so mad, she digs her heel into my
tttback, right there.
tttt(points to scar)
tttThat's permanent.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttYou see this!
tttt(moves neck slightly right)
tttThat's the farthest I can move my neck 
tttto the right Sophomore year, I'm going 
tttout with Maria Bennert, and for six 
tttmonths, I'm going down on her, and not 
ttta damn thing's happening.  
tttThen one night, I change a position, 
tttor vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly 
tttit's a whole new world.  She's moving 
tttaround, convulsing, breathing heavy.  
tttAnd her legs are pressing against my 
tttears so tightly that I don't hear her 
tttfather come into the room.  He grabs 
tttmy hair...
tttt(grabs his own hair and pulls 
ttttback)
ttt...and he pulls me way back, hard.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(throws up her leg, and rolls 
ttttup pants)
tttSenior year.  Spring Formal.  I'm 
ttteating our Missy Kurt in her brother's 
tttcar.  She's laying across the back 
tttseat, and I'm half-hanging out of the 
tttcar, my knees on the ground.  She's 
tttflailing around, and she knocks the 
tttparking brake off.  The car starts 
tttrolling down the hill, and my right 
tttknee is cut up all to shit like a 
tttkiddy's scissor class cut it up for 
tttpaper dolls.

tBanky and Alyssa laugh.  Holden looks at a small scar on 
this arm and thinks better about mentioning it.  Then Kim 
tre-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(off Banky's watch)
tttHoly shit, is that the time.  We've 
tttgotta beat traffic.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWhat traffic - it's one thirty in the 
tttmorning!

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(getting up)
tttAnd rush hour starts in six hours.  
tttLet's go.
tttt(to Alyssa)
tttThanks for inviting us out.  It was... 
ttteducational.

tAlyssa waves at him as he exits.  Banky slides out of the 
tbooth.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(to Kim)
tttSince you like chicks, right.. 
tttdo you just look at yourself in the 
tttmirror all the time?

tHolden reaches in and pulls Banky out.  Alyssa watches 
tthem go, then turns and kisses Kim.



<b>tINT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY
</b>
tHolden looks preoccupied.  Banky flips through magazines, 
tbiting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing.  He 
tsticks them between pages, presses the mag closed, picks 
tup another one and then repeats the whole process.  A

tttYou're still dwelling on the dyke,

tThe Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, 
tshocked.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(off her look)
tttDon't give me that look - I heard Adam 
tttCurry say worse.

tThe Secretary goes back to typing.  Banky shrugs at 
tHolden.

</b>tttThat's why I can't buy lesbians.  
tttEveryone needs dick.  See, I can buy

</b>tttWe just want to start off by saying 
tttthat it's a pleasure to finally meet

ttt'Snootchie Bootchies'.

tThe Execs and Sloss laugh.  Holden and Banky politely 
tjoin in.  Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots' 
tlook.

<b>tttttEXEC 1
</b>tttWhich brings us to our proposal: we 
tttare extremely interested in doing

tttlooking for something... something...

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttEven more retarded and juvenile to

tgives the thumbs up.

<b>tttttEXEC 1

tttSo what do you say! Are we in

tBanky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful

tBanky sits at the Exec's desk and starts rifling through 
tthe guy's stuff.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttNo, I'd like to be remembered as the 
tttfilthy rich guy who created Bluntman 
tttand Chronic.

<b>tttttHOLDEN

tttYou can break her resolve, killer.

tttt(glaring at Holden)
tttYou'll 'give it some thought'.  You're

</b>tttBut you don't.

tThey come to a swing set and sit down on the swings.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI don't know if that's the perception

tttAnd I'd like to get back to doing 
tttsomething more personal - like our

</b>tttYou're a pretty man.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttSure.  Harrison Ford.  And our mail-
tttman.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttWell it's the same thing.  I look at 
tttyou and just find you really handsome.  
tttAnd you know, it has very little to do 
tttwith your look, per-se.  Your look is 
tttfine, don't get me wrong.  But it's 
tttmore your outlook.  The things you

</b>tttCome on.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(beat)
tttIt's just that we've.., I mean, I've

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttDo you want to talk about it!

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttUm.  If you want to.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI like you.  I haven't liked a man in 
ttta long time.  And I'm not a man-hater 
tttor something.  It's just been some 
ttttime since I've been exposed to a man 
tttthat didn't immediately live-into a 
tttstereotype of some sort.  And I want 
tttyou to feel comfortable with me, 
tttbecause I want us to be friends.  So 
tttif there are things you'd like to 
tttknow, it's okay to ask me.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(beat)
tttWhy girls?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(beat)
tttWhy men?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttBecause that's the standard

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttIf that's the only reason you're

tttstandard..

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttIt's more than that.

</b>tttSo you've never been curious about

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttCurious about men?  Well... I always

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttNo.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttWhy not!

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttNo interest.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttBecause...?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttGirls feel right.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttAnd that's how I feel.  I've never

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttNo.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttBut you've only been with girls.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttYou're saying a person's a virgin 
tttuntil they've had intercourse with a 
tttmember of the opposite sex?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttIsn't that the standard definition?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttAgain with the standards.  I think 
tttvirginity is lost when you make love 
tttfor the first time.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWith a member of the opposite sex.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttWhy?  Why only then?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttBecause that's the standard.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttSo if a virgin is raped, then she's 
tttstill a virgin?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttOf course not.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttBut rape is not the standard.  So 
tttshe's had sex, but not the standard 
tttidea of sex.  Hence, according to  
tttyour definition, she'd still be a 
tttvirgin.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttOkay, I'll revise.  Virginity is lost 
tttwhen the hymen is broken.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttThen I lost my virginity at ten, 
tttbecause I fell on a fence post when I 
tttwas ten, and it broke my hymen.  Now I 
ttthave to tell people that I lost it to 
ttta wooden post I'd known my whole young 
tttlife?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttSecond revision - virginity is lost 
tttthrough penetration.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttPhysical penetration or emotional?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttEmotional?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttWell, I fell in love hard with Caitlin 
tttBree when we were in high school.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttPhysical penetration.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttWe had sex.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYeah, but not real sex.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI move to have that remark stricken 
tttfrom the record.  On account of it 
tttmakes you come off as completely naive 
tttand infantile.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWell where's the penetration in 
tttlesbian sex.

tAlyssa holds up her hand.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttA finger?  Come on.  I've had my 
tttfinger in my ass but I wouldn't say

tttfor Christ's sake.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttBut doesn't it hurt?!

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttSure.  But in a good way.  And it's

tttfor really special occasions.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWhat about not-so-special occasions?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttTongue only.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttBut how can that be enough?  I mean,

tAlyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her

</b>tttWhat are those?

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(looks at kid then books)
tttDo you Like horsies?

tHolden finishes dialing the phone.  Cross cut between him

tttThis sucks.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYou didn't get invited to the Con'?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI don't do southern con's - all the

tttYou know - both of us don't have to 
tttgo.

</b>tttReally?

</b>tttYeah.  Banky can go by himself.  It's

</b>tttI'll be there in half an hour.

tThey hang up.  Holden reacts to something OC and exits 
tquickly.

tC11. Banky points to pictures in the book.  The kid looks 
ton.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>ttt...And then Black Beauty couldn't take 
tttit any longer, and he finally did some 
tttof his own mounting.

<b>tttttKID

tHolden grabs Banky's arm and drags him away.

<b>tttttHOLDEN

</b>tttt(waving to kid)
tttI think I want kids of my own one day.  
tttThey're fun.

tttDon't forget to plug the Annual and 
tttdon't mention the t.v. show, okay?  
tttCall me if you get bored.

tAnd he's gone.  Banky stands there, open-mouthed.  A 
tcheck-in FLIGHT ATTENDANT comes up to him.  His name-tag 
treads 'Frank'.

<b>tttttFLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>tttChecking in, sir!

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(still watching Holden go)
tttHunhh!
tttt(looks at F.A.)
tttYeah.  But this is carry-on.

<b>tttttF.A.
</b>tttFederal aviation security law requires 
tttme to ask if you've been given any 
tttstrange gifts or parcels to carry-on 
tttsince arriving at the airport today.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(thinks)
tttNot this trip.  But one time, when I 
tttwas using curb side check-in, this sky-
tttcap gave me a cock ring and a set of 
tttanal ben-wa balls.  I always thought 
tttthat was pretty strange.  He said his 
tttname was Frank.
tttt(looks closely at him)
tttHey!  You're name's Frank!

tBanky storms away.  The Flight Attendant watches him go.

<b>tttttF.A.
</b>tttFucking kids.



<b>tEXT APARTMENT 6-D - DAY
</b>
tHolden knocks at the door.  It opens.  A WOMAN is 
tstanding in the doorway in her bra She looks Holden up 
tand down and smirks.

<b>tttttWOMAN
</b>tttLet me guess - 'the right man'?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttExcuse me?

<b>tttttWOMAN
</b>tttYou've got it in your head that 
tttAlyssa's not really into chicks - that 
tttshe just hasn't met the right man.  
tttAnd you believe you're it.  You're 
tttgoing to treat her right, fuck her 
tttlike a stud, and 'straight-jacket' her 
tttback from the land of the lost.  And 
tttthe sad truth is that you'll 
tttaccomplish none of that and wind up as 
ttteither an even more bitter misogynist 
tttor a reverse fag-hag.

tHolden's at a loss.  Alyssa slips past the Woman, 
tcarrying an overnight bag.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttDon't mind her.  That's just her way a 
tttsaying hello.

<b>tttttWOMAN
</b>tttActually, it's just my way of saying

</b>tttt(to Woman)
tttYou're such an asshole.

</b>tttLook, we're just friends.

</b>tttAnd how do you know men so well?

</b>tttBecause I lapdance for a living, dick-

tShe slams the door. Holden looks to Alyssa.

</b>tttOhhh - you look so cute!

tShe heads down the stairs.

</b>
tHolden sighs.  Alyssa plays with the radio.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttYou were raised Catholic, right?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYeah.  You?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttBaptist.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttReally?  Did you have a strict

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttPlease There was no time to be bad -

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYou think your upbringing had 
tttsomething to do with your lifestyle 
tttchoice?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttSomewhere along the line.  It's a 
tttgradual transition to make - from 
tttdoing what the majority does to taking 
ttta leap of faith and doing what feels 
tttmore natural.  Everything helps - from 
tttthe way you were handled as a kid, to 
tttthe way the boys acted in third grade, 
tttto the shoes you wore at your freshman 
tttprom.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttShoes?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttWell they were really tight.



<b>tHANGING OUT MONTAGE BEGINS
</b>
tWith the requisite music, over which we hear a 
tconversation between Holden and Alyssa.

t1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the DINER eating.  Holden's 
ttalking.  The Waitress walks past and drops her pad.  She 
tbends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in 
tthe process.  Alyssa stares at her ass.  Holden stops 
ttalking and stares at her.  Alyssa looks over at him and 
toffers a caught smile.

t2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE, 
tthrowing various things into the basket.  Alyssa comes up 
twith a box of Tampons and throws them in.  Holden glances 
tat them, a bit flushed.  Alyssa catches him, picks up the 
tbox, and pulls one out.  She proceeds to demonstrate 
ttheir usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming 
tinsertion.  Holden puts up his hands in the "I know, I 
tknow," fashion.

t3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to 
tAlyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes 
tto light it.  It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having 
ttrouble.  Holden grows a little frustrated.  Finally, he 
tgrabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with 
this teeth.  Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback.  
tHolden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke.  He 
tthen continues with his display.

t4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE.  Steve-Dave 
tand the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously.  Alyssa pays for a 
tcomic.  Steve-Dave glowers at Holden.  He gives Alyssa 
ther change and they exit.  Steve-Dave goes back to his 
tcard game with the Fan-Boy.  Suddenly, a garbage can 
tcomes crashing through their window.  Steve-Dave rips a 
tcheck off the garbage can and punches the counter.  The 
tFan-Boy rubs his back soothingly,

t5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking.  
tShe takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder. 
tHolden smiles to himself.

<b>tttttHOLDEN V.O.
</b>tttLet me ask you something - we get 
tttalong, right?

<b>tttttALYSSA V.O.
</b>tttFamously.

<b>tttttHOLDEN V.O.
</b>tttWe have a definite chemistry?

<b>tttttALYSSA V.O.
</b>tttSo it would seem.

<b>tttttHOLDEN V.O.
</b>tttBut we're both into girls.

<b>tttttALYSSA V.O.
</b>tttI'm into women.

<b>tttttHOLDEN V.O.
</b>tttBut you weren't always gay.

<b>tttttALYSSA V.O.
</b>tttWhen I was nine I had a crush on Scott 
tttBaio.

<b>tttttHOLDEN V.O.
</b>tttSo If we'd met a long time ago, say in 
ttthigh school...

<b>tttttALYSSA V.O.
</b>ttt...I'd still be muff-diving, yes.

<b>tttttHOLDEN V.O.
</b>tttThought so.



<b>tINT STUDIO - DAY
</b>
tHolden and Banky play EA Sports Hockey on Sega.  There's 
ta knock at the door.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttCome in.

tAlyssa enters and stands besides them, smiling at their 
tgame.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI read somewhere that guys who play 
ttthockey are merely making up for penile 
tttdeficiencies by carrying big sticks.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttI thought you lived in the city?  This 
tttis like the umpteenth time I've seen 
tttyou here.  Isn't that grounds enough 
tttfor the little pink mafia to throw you 
tttout of their club?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(hits Banky; to Alyssa)
tttI'll be ready in a second.  
tttI just have to school this mouthy 
tttsecond-stringer.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttBitch, you're schooling no one.

tThey play.  Cut back and forth between the game and 
tBanky, Holden, and Alyssa.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(off game)
tttWhat?  Do something!

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(off game)
tttYou fucking cock-teaser.  I'll knock 
tttyour fucking teeth out and pass all 
tttover your ass.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttLook at how slow you are.  Christ, you 
tttmove like a geriatric.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(screaming at screen)
tttFuck!  You Fucking cock-sucker, man!  
tttThese faggots won't do what I tell 
tttthem to!

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttOh. It's the controller, right?  It's 
tttalways the controller.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttNo, it's these... fucking queers on 
tttblades that can't accept a fucking 
tttpass to save their lives!  What period 
tttis this?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttFinal sixty of the third.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttFuck!  Look at your fucking guys, 
tttthey... FUCK!!!
tttt(whips controller)
<b>tttFUCKING COCK SUCKER, MAN!  I SWEAR TO 
</b><b>tttGOD!
</b>
tBanky storms away.  Alyssa looks at Holden,

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttImagine if I'd only beaten him by one 
tttinstead of thirty.



<b>tINT SKEE-BALL ARCADE - DAY
</b>
tHolden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine.  
tAlyssa looks on.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttExplain this again.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttHow could you have grown up down the 
tttshore and never played skee-ball?  
tttWhat did you do with your youth?

tThey head toward the skee-ball runs.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttStayed out late, smoked pot, screwed 
tttaround.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttNot your grade school years; your high 
tttschool years.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(off skee-ball run)
tttThis looks complicated.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(Inserts coin and pulls 
ttttlever)
tttThe premise is very basic - you roll 
tttthe ball up the ramp at varying 
tttspeeds, in an effort to pop it into 
tttthe score circles.  The higher the 
tttscore, the more prize tickets you get.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttWhat do you do with the prize tickets?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttTrade them in for prizes that aren't 
tttworth nearly as much as you paid to 
tttplay the game.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttThen what's the point?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttIt's fun.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttAnd you question my lifestyle.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttObserve.

tHolden rolls the ball.  It pops into a twenty point 
tcircle.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttSee?  It's just that simple.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttWhy not just walk up there and put it 
tttin the fifty every time?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWhere's the skill in that?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttOh, this is a skill?  I'm sorry, I had 
tttno idea.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttJust toss one.

tAlyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it 
toverhand.  It pops off one of the circles and shoots back 
tat them, missing them as they duck.  An OC knock and an 
t"OW!" is heard.  Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(to OC guy)
tttI'm sorry, man.  She's new at this.

tHolden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head.  
tHe gets up.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(to OC)
tttThank you.
tttt(hands Alyssa another ball)
tttUnderhand.  Throw it underhand.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttThis is where you take straight chicks 
ttton dates?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttIt's like Spanish Fly.  This'll 
tttprobably be the first time I don't 
tttscore afterwards.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI don't know.  I'm starting to get a 
ttttingle in my bottom.
tttt(tosses a ball)
tttTen.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(grabs a ball)
tttSo what'd you do last night?
tttt(prepares to throw)

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttGot laid

tHolden whips the ball in surprise.  It ricochets off the 
tceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine.  
tAlyssa laughs.  Holden looks around, nervously.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttSome more of that skill you were 
ttttelling me about?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttMaybe we should just leave before 
tttsomebody gets hurt.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttNo way.  I want a cheap prize.
tttt(throws a ball)
tttSo your friend's quite the homophobe.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttHe just feels left out, I think.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI'm not talking about his infantile 
ttthang-up with me.  I'm talking about 
tttwhen you two were playing that game.  
tttEverytime he swore - when his players 
tttmessed up, he called them cocksuckers, 
ttthe referred to the players as queers, 
ttthe called you a cock-teaser...

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI thought he was talking to you.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI know you think it means nothing, and 
tttit may in fact be unintentional, but 
tttit's ugly all the same.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttHe was just pissed he was losing.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttSo he slams the gay community?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttC'mon.  Don't get all p.c. on me.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI'm not.  But what is that saying?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttIt says he gets too easily frustrated.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttIt's passive/agressive gay-bashing.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttHow do you figure?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttHow casually did it roll off his 
ttttongue?  And that's how he expresses 
ttthis anger?  By calling people faggots?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI think you're reading too much into 
tttit.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI think you're just so used to it that 
tttit rolls off your back.  I've heard 
tttthe two of you play your little rank 
tttout game where one insists the other 
tttis gay.
tttt(as the boys)
ttt"You're a faggot.  No, you're a 
tttfaggot."  It's cute and all to watch 
tttyou go at it like grade-schooler, but 
tttit's also offensive - labeling and 
tttducking the label of being gay as if 
tttit were the scarlet fucking letter.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYou're blowing this way out of 
tttproportion.  We live in a more 
ttttolerant age now.  You refer to 
tttyourself as a dyke.  Hooper calls 
ttthimself a faggot all the time...

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttYeah, but that's what's known as 
tttempowerment/disempowerment.  I call 
tttmyself a dyke so it's not too 
tttdevastating when some throwback 
tttscreams it at me as I'm leaving a bar 
tttat night.  
tttSame for Hooper - by calling himself a 
tttfaggot, he steals the thunder away 
tttfrom the mouthy jerks of this world 
tttwho'd like to beat him to it.  But the 
tttdifference between us having it and 
tttyour friend saying it is miles wide.  
tttWe say it to mask the pain - you say 
tttit for lack of a better expression at 
tttany given moment.  No Holden, we do 
tttnot live in a more tolerant age.  And 
tttif you think that's the case, then 
tttyou've been in the suburbs way too 
tttlong to be resuscitated.

tHolden kind of sulks.  Alyssa notices.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttBut you know what?
tttt(picks up his face)
tttI have more faith in you than that.
tttt(rips her tickets off)
tttCome on - I want my cheap prize.



<b>tINT STUDIO - NIGHT
</b>
tHolden enters.  Banky's still playing Sega.  Holden sits 
tnext to him.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(off screen)
tttHow bad do you suck!

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttHow was your pseudo-date?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttLeave it alone.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttThat chick bugs me.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(rubs his head; in baby-talk)
tttAww.  Everyone bugs you.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttGet off.
tttt(off game)
tttFucking faggot!  Did you see that?!  
tttYour dyke courting ass just got me 
tttscored on!

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(beat)
tttYou know, you should watch that.  If 
tttyou're going to get all bent out of 
tttshape while playing the game, so much 
tttso that you need to curse the t.v., 
ttttry not to gay-bash it, alright.  
tttYou're nor that kind of guy.
tttt(gets up)
tttAnd don't call her a dyke, alright?  
tttShe's a lesbian.

tHolden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat.  
tBanky sits there, shocked.  He puts the controller down 
tand crosses to the drawing table.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWhat the fuck is going on here?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(pulling out pencil)
tttI'm starting a new page.

<b>tttttBANKY

tttNot with this shit!  With you.  What 
tttthe fuck is going on with you and that 
tttgirl?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWe're friends.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttShe's programming you.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI beg your pardon?  Programming?

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttYeah.  And apparently, you don't even 
tttrealize it.  What does it matter if I 
tttrefer to her as a dyke, or if I call 
tttthe Whalers a bunch of faggots in the 
tttprivacy of my own office, far from the 
tttsensitive ears of the rest of the 
tttworld?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttIt's passive/aggressive gay-bashing; 
tttand I know you're not really 
tttprejudiced at heart.  You should just 
tttfind some other way to express your 
tttanger, is all I'm saying.

tHolden starts drawing.  Banky stares at him.  Then he 
tgrabs the pencil out of Holden's hand and shoves him to 
tthe side.  He starts drawing something.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWhat the fuck are you doing!

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttBear with me here.  I just want to put 
tttyou through this little exercise.
tttt(drawing feverishly)
tttOkay, now see this?  This is a four 
tttway road, okay?

tBanky draws a four-way stop.  He illustrates according to 
this voice-over.

<b>tttttBANKY V.O.
</b>tttAnd dead in the center, is a crisp, 
tttnew, hundred dollar bill.  Now at the 
tttend of each of the streets, are four 
tttpeople, okay?  You following?  Up 
ttthere, we got a male-affectionate, easy-
tttto-get-along-with, no political agenda 
tttlesbian.  Okay?  Now down here, we 
ttthave a man-hating, angry-as-fuck,

tBanky finishes drawing.  Holden's shaking his head

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttWhich one's going to get to the 
ttthundred dollar bill first?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWhat is this supposed to prove?

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttI'm serious.  This is a serious

tttShe knows you've got this schoolboy

twatches her, then follows.

tHolden, who offers a puzzled shrug.  Alyssa offers the

</b>tttBecause it's captured the moment.  
tttIt'll be a constant reminder - not

tttaffection, puppy-dog way, although I'm 
tttsure that's what you'll call it.  And 
tttit's not because you're unattainable.  
tttI love you.  Very simple, very truly.  
tttYou're the epitome of every attribute 
tttand quality I've ever looked for in 
tttanother person.  I know you think of 
tttme as just a friend and crossing that 
tttline is the furthest thing from an 
tttoption you'd ever consider.  But I 
tttcan't do this any longer.  I can't 
tttstand next to you without wanting to 
ttthold you.  I can't look into your eyes 
tttwithout feeling that longing you only 
tttread about in trashy romance novels.  
tttI can't talk to you without wanting to 
tttexpress my love for everything you 
tttare.  I know this will probably queer 
tttour friendship - no pun intended - but 
tttI had to say it, because I've never 
tttfelt this before, and I like who I am 
tttbecause of it.  And if bringing it to 
tttlight means we can't hang out anymore, 
tttthen that hurts me.  But I couldn't 
tttallow another tday to go by without 
tttgetting it out there, regardless of 
tttthe outcome, which by the look on your 
tttface is to be the inevitable shoot-
tttdown.  And I'll accept that But I know 
tttsome part of you is hesitating for a 
tttmoment, and if there is a moment of 
ttthesitation, that means you feel 
tttsomething too.  All I ask is that you 
tttnot suppress that - at least for ten 
tttminutes - and try to dwell in it 
tttbefore you dismiss it.  
tttThere isn't another soul on this 
tttfucking planet who's ever made me the 
tttperson I am when I'm with you, and I 
tttwould risk this friendship for the 
tttchance to take it to the next plateau.  
tttBecause it's there between you and me.  
tttYou can't deny that.  And even if we 
tttnever speak again after tonight, 
tttplease know that I'm forever changed 
tttbecause of you and what you've meant 
tttto me, which - while I do appreciate 
tttit - I'd never need a painting of

</b>tttIt's unfair that I'm in love with you?

tShe looks at him, rain drenching the pair.  She shakes 
ther head ruefully.

</b>tttGo home, Holden.

tShe walks away.  Holden stands there, at a loss.  Then he 
tturns and heads back to his car.  
tAs he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, 
tAlyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with 
thim, big time.  He drops his keys and embraces her.

tAnd there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched 
tkissing.



<b>tEXT STUDIO - DAY
</b>
tBanky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys 
twith the other.  He jams them into the lock, opening the 
tdoor.  He picks up the mail on the floor.



<b>tINT STUDIO - DAY
</b>
tHe closes the door behind him and shuffles to the 
tkitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering 
tforms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each 
tother's arms.  The place looks a mess - Like a couple of 
tpeople were engaged in some tremendous fucking.  Banky is 
toblivious.  He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls 
tout a chocolate milk.  He opens it, sticks a straw into 
tthe top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail.  
tHe comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the 
tcouch, near Holden's head.  He looks down at the sleeping 
tcouple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats.  
tThen he freezes.  He looks down again, and drops his jaw 
tand his carton of choco.  It hits the floor with a pop.  
tHolden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to 
tfocus.  They look at one another, then at the 
tflabbergasted Banky.  Banky blinks.  Then he shuffles 
ttoward the door again and lets himself out.

tttStay here.

tBanky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden 
tsaunters up and sits beside him.  He follows Banky's 
tgaze.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttCatholic school girls.

tAcross the street, the Catholic High School is letting 
tout.  Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters 
tsmoke, frolic, wait for their bus.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttThe uniform is what does it for me.  I 
tttwish I'd have went with more Catholic 
tttschool girls when I was a kid.  As it 
tttstands.  I have no "...and then she

tttwhen your best friend's wrapped around 
ttta naked rug-muncher on your couch.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttShe had boxers on.

tBanky shoots him a glare.  He goes back to staring at the 
tOC girls.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttThis is all going to end badly.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYou don't know that.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttI know you.  You're way too

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttBut we have read about them.  So we're

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttThere's no 'we' here.  You're going to

tttto deal with it on a regular basis.  
tttWhen you guys are walking in the mall 
tttand both your heads turn at a really

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI'm a guy.  You're attracted to girls.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI see you've been taking notes. 
tttHistorically, yes  that's true.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttThen why this?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI've given that a lot of thought, you 
tttknow?  I mean, now that I'm being 
tttostracized by my friends, I've had a 
tttlot of time to think about all of 
tttthis.  And what I've come up with is 
tttreally simple: I came to this on my 
tttterms.  I didn't just heed what I was 
ttttaught, you  know?  Men and women 
tttshould be together, it's the natural 
tttway - that kind of thing.  I'm not 
tttwith you because of what family, 
tttsociety, life tried to instill in me 
tttfrom day one.  The way the world is - 
ttthow seldom you meet that one person 
tttwho gets you... it's so rare.   My 
tttparents didn't really have it.  There 
tttwas no example set for me in the world 
tttof male/female relation ships.  And to 
tttcut oneself off from finding that 
tttperson - to immediately half your 
tttoptions by eliminating the possibility 
tttof finding that one person within your 
tttown gender... that just seemed stupid.  
tttSo I didn't.  And by leaving my 
tttoptions open, I was branded 'gay', 
tttwhich to me was no big deal - labels 
tttare labels, you know?  They define 
tttwhat you do, not who you are, I guess. 
tttBut ttthen you come along.  You - 
tttthe one least likely; I mean, you were 
ttta guy.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttStill am.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttAnd while I was falling for you, I put 
ttta ceiling on that, because you were a 
tttguy.  
tttUntil I remembered why I opened the 
tttdoor to women in the first place - to 
tttnot limit the likelihood of finding 
tttthat one person who'd compliment me so 
tttcompletely.  And so here we are, I was 
tttthorough when I looked for you, and I 
tttfeel justified lying in your arms - 
tttbecause I got here on my terms, and 
ttthave no question that there was 
tttsomeplace I didn't look.  And that 
tttmakes all the difference.

</b>tttt(beat)

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(joking - in case you didn't

t3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon 
toff the shelf.  He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's 
treading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick 
tporno.  An old WOMAN stares at her.  Holden nods to the 
told Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands, 
tputting it back on the shelf.  He ushers her away.  The 
told Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the 
ttape herself,

t4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the 
tpark, her crotch against the back of his neck.  He's 
ttalking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.  She 
tbegins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.  
tHe pulls her off and put her down.  She's laughing.  He's 
tflushed with embarrassment.  The same Old Woman from the 
tVideo store passes by with her husband.  Holden shrugs.

t5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the 
twaving, then putting up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden 
tagain, this time with the painting hung completely upside 
tdown.  He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze.

t6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.  There 
tare penciled pages on it with a note that says "Hanging 
tout with Alyssa today.  Holden".  Banky crumples it up 
tand throws it across the room.

t7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then 
tthat way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.  
tShe settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile 
tcrawling across her face, and closes her eyes.  We pull 
tback to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her, 
teating her out (no, we don't see anything!).

tHolden looks down at that book.  It's the Nineteen Eighty 
tEight yearbook from Middletown North.  He shakes his head 
tat Banky and flips it open.

tOn the page is Alyssa's Senior year photo.  Under her 
tname is another name in quotes that says 'Finger Cuffs'.

tttMe and Rick Derris used to hang our 
tttwith her for awhile, right?  Just 
ttthanging around her house after school,  
ttt'cuz her parents were like never home, 
tttand shit.  And one day, Rick just 
tttwhips it out, and starts rubbing it on

tttthe living room - I was dying.  But 
tttyou know what the crazy bitch did?  
tttShe fucking drops to her knees, and 
tttjust starts sucking him off right in 
tttfront of me!  Like I wasn't even there 
tttman!  I almost died!  But that's not 
tttthe fucked up part - the fucked up 
tttpart was Rick, man - right in the 
tttmiddle of it, he turns to me and he's 
tttpointing at her and he says "Cohee."  
tttJust like that - "Cohee."  So I'm like 
tttI'll give it a shot.  And I start 
tttpulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz 
tttI figure any second she's gonna turn 
tttaround and belt me in the mouth, 
tttright?  But yo, check this shit out - 
tttshe's all into it man!  She don't try

tttSo Rick's the one that came up with

tttAnd if you ever even so much as

tThe Kid offers Holden an angry look.  Hooper gives him 
tback his comic.

</b>tttFight the power, little 'G'.

</b>tttWord is bond

tThe Kid leaves, Hooper slips back into his real voice.

tttabout gay men that terrifies the rest 
tttof the world.
tttt(shakes his head)
tttAs for this hang-up with Alyssa's

tttnot be true.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWhat do you mean?

<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttHolden - don't even try to come off 
tttlike you don't know what I'm saying.  
tttMen need to believe that they're Marco 
tttfucking Polo when it comes to sex - 
tttlike they're the only ones who've ever 
tttexplored new territory.  And it's hard 
tttnot to let them believe it.  I let my

tttthem some of that "I've never done 
tttthis before..." bullshit, and let 'em 
tttlabor under the delusion that they 
tttrockin' my world, until I can't stand 
tttthem anymore.  Then I hit 'em with the 
ttttruth.  It's a sick game.  The world 
tttwould be a better place if people 
tttwould just accept that there's nothing 
tttnew under the sun, and everything you 
tttcan do with a person has probably been 
tttdone long before you got there.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI can accept that.

<b>tttttHOOPER
</b>tttHoney, that almost sounded convincing.  
tttDo yourself a favor - just ask her

tttout of the way, before it gets too big 
tttfor both ya'll to move.
tttt(spotting something OC)
tttOooh!  'Myra Breckinridge'!

tHooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his 
thands.  Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely 
tclad, making out.  The title is 'Men Suck.. and so do 
tGirls - All XXX Action.'

tOn the ice, two teams clash, chasing the puck up and

tIn the bleachers, amidst a slew of fans, Alyssa watches 
tthe game with a large degree of enjoyment.  Sitting 
tbeside her, Holden doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm.

tPlayer Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his

tThe crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild.

tttThey really took advantage of my

tON THE ICE - Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and

tanger, so enthralled with the action is she.

tON THE ICE - Player One staggers a bit, then quickly 
trights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a 
tbarrage of his own punches.  Blood sprays across the ice.

tHolden's eyes are downcast.  Alyssa waits for a response.

</b>tttI want us to be something that we 
tttcan't.

</b>tttAnd what's that?

</b>tttt(beat)
tttA normal couple.

tHolden sits on the couch, alone in the dark.  The door 
topens and Banky enters.  He stands there, sizing up 
tHolden's mood.

</b>tttThe girl?

tHolden nods.  Banky nods back.  He stands there for a 
tbeat.  Then he sits beside Holden.  He opens his arms.  
tHolden shifts into his friend's embrace and begins crying 
ton his shoulder.  Banky pats his back.  Pull back on a

</b>tttWhat took you so long?

</b>tttWe were at the mall.  You bring the

tHolden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it 
tto Jay.  Jay opens it and pulls out a thick wad of bills, 
talong with the latest issue of 'BLUNTMAN and CHRONIC.'

tSilent Bob.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttWhat..what did you say?

<b>tttttBOB
</b>tttYou're chasing Amy.

tHolden stares, shocked.  He looks to Jay, who's still 
trolling his joint.

<b>tttttJAY
</b>tttWhat do you look so shocked for?  He 
tttdoes this all the time.  Fat bastard 
tttthinks just because he never says

<b>tttttBOB
</b>tttWhy don't you shut up?  Jesus!  Always

tttt(to Holden)
tttI went through something like what 
tttyou're going through.  Years ago.  
tttSame kind of thing with a girl named 
tttAmy.

<b>tttttJAY
</b>tttWhen?

<b>tttttBOB
</b>tttA couple of years ago.

<b>tttttJAY
</b>tttWhat'd she 'Live in Canada' or 
tttsomething?  Why don't I remember this?

<b>tttttBOB
</b>tttWhat you don't know about me I can 
tttjust about squeeze into the Grand 
tttfucking Canyon.  Did you know I always 
tttwanted to be a dancer in Vegas?

tJay and Holden look at him.  Silent Bob busts a move with 
this hands.

<b>tttttBOB
</b>tttHunhh?  Bet you didn't know that?

<b>tttttJAY
</b>tttJust cell your fucking story so we can 
tttget out of here and smoke this.

<b>tttttBOB
</b>tttt(to Holden)
tttSo there's me an Amy, and we're all 
tttinseparable, right?  Just big time in 
tttlove.  And then about four months in, 
tttI ask about the ex-boyfriend.  Dumb 
tttmove, I know, but you know how it is - 
tttyou don't really want to know, but you 
tttjust have to... stupid guy bullshit.  
tttAnyway she starts telling me all about 
ttthim - how they dated for years, lived 
ttttogether, her mother likes me better, 
tttblah, blah, blah - and I'm okay.  But 
tttthen she tells me that a couple times, 
ttthe brought other people to bed with 
tttthem - menage a tois, I believe it's 
tttcalled.  Now this just blows my mind.  
tttI mean, I'm not used to that sort of 
tttthing, right?  I was raised Catholic.

<b>tttttJAY
</b>tttSaint Shithead.

tSilent Bob backhands him.  Jay raises his fist as if to 
tstrike.

<b>tttttBOB
</b>tttDo something.
tttt(to Holden)
tttSo I get weirded out, and just start 
tttblasting her, right?  This is the only 
tttway I can deal with it - by calling 
ttther a slut, and telling her that she 
tttwas used - I mean, I'm out for blood I 
tttwant to hurt her - because I don't 
tttknow how to deal with what I'm 
tttfeeling.  And I'm like "What the fuck 
tttis wrong with you?"  and she's telling 
tttme that it was that time, in that 
tttplace, and she didn't do anything 
tttwrong, so she's not gonna apologize.  
tttSo I tell her it's over, and I walk.

<b>tttttJAY
</b>tttFucking a.

<b>tttttBOB
</b>tttNo, idiot.  It was a mistake.  I 
tttwasn't disgusted with her, I was 
tttafraid.  At that moment, I felt small - 
tttlike I'd lacked experience, like I'd 
tttnever be on her level or never be 
tttenough for her or something.  
tttAnd what I didn't get was that she 
tttdidn't care.  She wasn't looking for 
tttthat guy anymore.  She was looking for 
tttme.  But by the time I realized this, 
tttit was too late, you know.  She'd 
tttmoved on, and all I had to show for it 
tttwas some foolish pride, which then 
tttgave way to regret.  She was the girl, 
tttI know that now.  But I pushed her 
tttaway...

tEveryone's silent Silent Bob lights a cigarette.

<b>tttttBOB
</b>tttSo I've spent every day since then 
tttchasing Amy...
tttt(takes a drag from his smoke)
tttSo to speak.

tThey sit there for a beat.  Jay pockets the rest of his 
tdime-bag.

tttt(to Silent Bob)
tttGet up, bitch
tttt(to Holden)
tttWe gotta book.  We're catching a bus

</b>tttBusiness, yo.  How many more of those 
tttphat envelopes do we got coming to us?

</b>tttYeah?  Good.  I'll be glad as shit 
tttwhen it's gone.

<b>tttttHOLDEN

tttthemselves in a comic book.

<b>tttttJAY
</b>tttI know.  I spend every fucking waking 
ttthour with one of them.  But it ain't

tttsaying?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttSnootchie-bootchies.

tttIt's a big world, g - but we're bound

tExit Jay and Silent Bob.  Holden remains in the booth,

<b>tMONTAGE - AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE
</b>
t1) Holden sits at his drawing table, tapping his pencil 
tup and down.

t2)Alyssa sits in a club, getting talked at by some women. 
tShe's not present in the conversation.

t3) Banky meets with Sloss at a restaurant Sloss shakes 
tthe contracts at him, and Banky makes the "I know, I 
tknow," face.

t4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him.

t5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone.  She hangs up, 
tangrily.

t6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked 
tthrough.  He's staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture.  He 
tcloses the book and sighs.  Then, an idea hits him.  He 
tjumps up and dashes out of the park.

ttttime, knowing that we have shit to 
tttsettle between us, separately.

tttI've been going through things, over 
tttand over.  And I dissected it all, and 
tttlooked at it a thousand different 
tttways.  Banky - there's friction 
tttbetween us for the first time in our

</b>tttHow perceptive.

</b>tttAlyssa - you and I hit a wall, because

tttt(back to pacing)
tttNow - I know I'm to blame one way or 
tttthe other on both accounts.  With you, 
tttAlyssa - it's my fault because I feel 
tttinadequate.  Because you've had so

tand speechless - looks away.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttIt's something you're going to have to

</b>tttNow - at this point, you may be asking

tttgoing over and over in my head for the

tAlyssa's face drops.  She subtly shakes her head.

</b>tttDon't you see?  That would take care

tttmake it that much more powerful.  And 
tttBanky - you can cake that leap that 
ttteveryone else but you sees that you 
tttshould take.  And it'll be okay, 
tttbecause it'll be with me - your best 
tttfriend for years.  We've been 
ttteverything to each other but

tttthrough that together too.  And it 
tttwon't have to be a total leap for you, 
tttbecause a woman will be involved.  And 
tttwhen it's over, all that aggression 
tttyou feel toward Alyssa will be gone.  
tttBecause you'll have shared in

tttI'll moan differently and then you'll 
tttresent Banky, and become suspicious of 
tttus.  Or you'll alienate him because of

tttfor the deterioration of your

tttdoubt it, but what if - I saw 
tttsomething in Banky that I never saw 
tttbefore, and fell in love with him and

</b>tttBlast from the past.

tBanky sits at his own signing table.  Behind him hangs a 
tbanner that reads 'BANKY EDWARDS - CREATOR Of BABY DAVE'.  
tA small line is formed in front of him.  He talks with a 
<b>tFAN.
</b>
<b>tttttFAN
</b>tttDo you know how much it's going for 
tttthese days?  One ten.  You signing it 
tttwill push that up even higher,

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttIf you sell it, I want a kickback
tttt(starts signing)

<b>tttttFAN
</b>tttI don't know if this is true, but I 
tttheard once that there was going to be 
tttan animated series.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttThere was going to be

<b>tttttFAN
</b>tttWhat happened!

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(off comic)
tttYou're looking at it.  No Chronic - no 
tttcartoon

<b>tttttFAN
</b>tttThat sucks man.  That would've been 
tttawesome.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttTell me about it

<b>tttttFAN
</b>tttIs that what happened to you and 
tttHolden McNeil?  You got into a fight 
tttover the rights or something?

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttIt was a little more involved than 
tttthat.

<b>tttttFAN
</b>tttWhatever happened to him?

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttHe quit the biz.  I guess.

<b>tttttFAN
</b>tttYou guys don't talk anymore?

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(looks OC)
tttNo.  Not really.

tBanky locks eyes with someone OC.  His expression 
tsoftens.

tHolden leans against a wall on the far side of the room.  
tHe smiles at Banky.  Banky smiles back, and sort of nods.

tHolden holds up a copy of Banky's new solo comic.  He 
tpoints to it and gives a thumbs up.

<b>tttttOC FAN
</b>tttProbably shouldn't have killed off 
tttChronic.

tBanky smiles to OC.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttGuess not.  Some doors just shouldn't 
tttbe opened.

tBanky looks in another direction, OC.  He looks at Holden 
tand points to it.   Holden looks in the same direction, 
tand then looks back at Banky and nods.

<b>tttttOC FAN
</b>tttYou don't need that guy, anyway.  You 
tttdo great stuff without him.

tBanky looks at Holden for a beat.  Then he brings his 
tpointer fingers together,  mimicing Holden's 'shared 
tmoment' gesture.

tHolden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers - as if 
tto say 'hopefully'.

<b>tttttOC FAN
</b>tttYou were just carrying that guy, 
tttanyway.

tBanky sort of smiles at the OC Holden.  Then he offers 
this own thumbs up - as to say 'good luck'.

<b>tttttBANKY
</b>tttt(to fan, still looking OC)
tttYou're so right.

tHolden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off.

<b>tttttOC FAN
</b>tttWell, keep up the good work, man.  
tttLove them dick jokes.  Love 'em.  See 
tttya.

tThe Fan Leaves, but Banky is watching Holden go.

<b>tttttBXVKY
</b>tttYeah.  Bye.
tttt(shakes it off)
tttOkay.  Who's next?

tAlyssa sits at a separate signing table, with a line in 
tfront of her.  A WOMAN behind her.  Alyssa dashes off 
tsignatures in the copies of her comic.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(to OC departing fan)
tttThanks for reading it.

tThe Woman stands and rubs her shoulders.

<b>tttttWOMAN
</b>tttI'm going to get a soda.  You want 
tttanything?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI'm fine, thanks,

tThe Woman heads off.  Alyssa starts rummaging through her 
tbag.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(not rooking up)
tttOkay, who's next!

tA comic book drops on the table in front of her.   It's a 
tcomic book called 'Chasing Amy'.

tShe leafs through it, not looking up.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttUm... This isn't one of mine.

<b>tttttOC HOLDEN
</b>tttIt's mine.

tAlyssa looks up sharply.

tHolden stands before her, smiling.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI saved you one.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttHi.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttHi.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(beat)
tttHow've you been?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttGood.  Really good.  Yourself?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttGood
tttt(beat; off her own comic)
tttNew issue's selling like crazy, for 
tttsome reason.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttBecause it's so good.  I really liked 
tttit.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttThank you.
tttt(off comic)
tttI haven't even seen this yet.  Did it 
tttjust come out?

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttA month ago.  I did a really small 
tttrun.  Self-financed.  Only about five 
ttthundred issues.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttWill I enjoy it?
<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttYou might.  It's familiar subject 
tttmatter.

tAlyssa leafs through it.  Her eyes get somewhat misty.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttLooks Like a very personal story.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI finally had something personal to 
tttsay.

tThey look at each other for a beat

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI'm going to go.  I don't want to hold 
tttup the line.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttYeah.  I mean, it can get ugly.  I 
tttjust saw this nun in line call this 
tttsmall child a cunt-rag.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttt(smiles)
tttRead that, when you have a minute

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttI will.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttI'd like to hear your thoughts about 
tttit.  If you get a chance, give me a 
tttcall.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttOkay.

tThey look at each other for a beat.

<b>tttttHOLDEN
</b>tttNice seeing you again,

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttReally nice to see you too.

tHe walks away.  A few steps away, he turns and waves 
tagain.  She waves back.  And then he starts moving 
tthrough the thrall of fan-boys.

tThe Woman returns with coffee.  She follows Alyssa's 
tgaze.

<b>tttttWOMAN
</b>tttwho was that?

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttHmm!  Oh.  Just some guy I knew.

tShe watches him go for another beat, then.

<b>tttttALYSSA
</b>tttt(to line)
tttNext
tttt(to Woman)
tttSo what do you want to do tonight?

tAnd as they fall into conversation, the show goes on.
