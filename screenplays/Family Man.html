</b>
<b>t1tINT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, PAN AM TERMINAL - NIGHT
</b>
<b>ttSUPER:  AUTUMN, 1987
</b>
ttA line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to 
ttLondon.

ttJACK CAMPBELL, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, Tom 
ttSelleck mustache,  the hopeful look of youth in his 
tteyes... sitting next to...

ttKATE REYNOLDS, 21, pretty, Dorothy Hamill haircut...
ttrubbing the tears from  her swollen red eyes...

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttI got you a few necessities...

ttKate hands Jack a new copy of Vonnegutx92s x93Catx92s 
ttCradle.x94

<b>tttttKATE  (CONTx92D)
</b>tttYour copy was a mess...

ttJack accepts the book but hex92s unable to take his eyes 
ttoff Kate.  She hands him a cassette.

<b>tttttKATE (CONTx92D)
</b>tttEvery one of these songs will 
tttremind you of me in a slightly 
tttdifferent way...

<b>tttttJACK
</b>tttAll in one tape?

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttI also put side two of London 
tttCalling on there...

ttKate leans over and kisses him passionately on the 
ttlips.

<b>tttttKATE  (CONTx92D)
</b>tttThat was not officially the 
tttgoodbye kiss. It was just an 
tttinterim kiss...

ttHe looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her 
ttclose, kissing her deeply. Then...

<b>tttttANNOUNCER (O.S.)
</b>tttThis will be the final boarding 
tttcall for Pan Am flight 4 to 
tttLondon, Heathrow.

ttJack takes Katex92s hand, getting up, turning sadly to 
ttthe gate.

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttYou have your ticket?

ttJack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE.  Kate 
ttnods. They embrace and kiss again.  As they separate.

<b>tttttJACK
</b>tttIx92m not even gonna say it, 
tttKate. Maybe itx92ll be like 
tttI never left...

ttJack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the 
ttgate.

ttKate stands there, watching him go.  Then...

tt...a  moment of intuition. Something isnx92t right. She 
ttlooks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway, 
tttrying to decide...

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttWait.

ttJack turns. Kate approaches him.

<b>tttttKATE (CONTx92D)
</b>tttI have a bad feeling about 
tttthis.

<b>tttttJACK
</b>tttAbout the plane? What do you 
tttthink itx92s gonna crash? Donx92t 
tttsay that...

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttt(shaking her head)
tttI know wex92ve talked about this a 
tttthousand times and we both agree 
tttthat going to London is the 
tttright thing to do. But in my 
tttheart... this feels wrong.

ttShe looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, 
ttthen back into Jackx92s eyes.

<b>tttttKATE (CONTx92D)
</b>tttDonx92t  go, Jack...

<b>tttttJACK
</b>tttYou mean donx92t go at all?  
tttWhat about my internship?

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttBelieve me I know what an 
tttincredible opportunity this 
tttis for you...

<b>tttttJACK
</b>tttFor us, Kate.

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttRight, for us. But...Ix92m
tttafraid that if you get on 
tttthat plane...

<b>tttttJACK
</b>tttWhat?

ttKate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she canx92t 
ttsay...

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttt(torn)
tttGo. Ix92m sorry, you should just 
tttgo...

<b>tttttJACK
</b>tttt(thinking, then...)
tttNo, youx92re right.  What are we 
tttdoing?

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttWe're being responsible.  Go.
tttGet on the plane.

ttHis eyes narrow as he measures her determination...

<b>tttttKATE (CONT'D)
</b>tttt(a smile)
tttGet the hell outta my sight.
tttYou bother me.

ttA laugh from Jack.  Kate gives him a calm smile and a
ttnod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for
ttJack.

<b>tttttJACK
</b>tttt(resolute)
tttOkay, I'm going...

ttHe takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her
tttight.  Jack looks toward the gate, the line
ttdisappearing...Kate grasps his shirt tightly.

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttI can't seem to let go of
tttyou...

<b>tttttJACK
</b>tttYou hear me complaining about
tttthat?

ttA sober look in Jack's eyes.

<b>tttttJACK (CONT'D)
</b>tttLook, we're at the airport and
tttno one ever thinks clearly at
tttthe airport so we should just
ttttrust the decision we already
tttmade.  You've been accepted to
tttone of the best law schools in
tttthe country, I've got this
tttinternship at Barclay's Bank.
tttWe have a great plan, honey...

ttKate nods, then, with resolve...

<b>tttttKATE
</b>tttYou want to do something
tttgreat, Jack?  Let's flush the
tttplan...start our lives right
tttnow, today...I don't know what
tttthat life's gonna look like
tttbut I do know it has both of
tttus in it.  And I choose us...

ttJack is jolted by her words.

<b>tttttKATE (CONT'D)
</b>tttThe plan doesn't make us
tttgreat, Jack.  What we have
ttttogether, that's what makes us
tttgreat.

ttHer words sink in...A long moment of decision...He
ttlooks toward the gate, only one person left in
ttline...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes.

ttFinally...He kisses her deeply on the lips...

<b>tttttJACK
</b>tttI love you, Kate...

tt...a smile from Kate...relief...then...

<b>tttttJACK (CONT'D)
</b>tttt(taking her face in
tttt his hands)
ttt...and a year in London's not
tttgonna change that.  A hundred
tttyears couldn't change that...

ttJack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to
ttthe gate, handing the attendant his ticket, not able to
ttlook back.

ttKate watches him go, tears streaming down her face, as
ttthe gate door closes behind him.  She waits, almost
ttwilling it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it
ttdoesn't...

ttwhere he sees...

ttA WOMAN'S BACK...draped in a towel...an incredible
ttback, neither flabby nor overly toned, beautifully
ttcurved...Jack focuses on it a moment. As the woman
ttturns to him...

ttPAULA.  Beautiful, late 20s, a toothbrush in her

<b>tttttPAULA
</b>tttt(holding up toothbrush)
ttt   I hope you don't mind.  There

ttA playful smile from Paula.

ttHe looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to

ttand a charming little bay window.

ttHe instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch

ttJack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn 
ttaround, Cashx92s door SLAMS shut and the car takes off in 
tta blast of horsepower...

ttJack stands there gazing down the street, listening to 
ttthe sound of the Ferrari shifting gears,

ttThe wind whips up...shivering, Jack looks toward the

ttand finally to the mini-van.
