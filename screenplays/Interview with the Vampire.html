<b>ttttttttt FADE IN:
</b>

<b>tINT. ROOM - NIGHT (SAN FRANCISCO)
</b>
tA small bare room, illuminated only by the streetlight
tcoming through the window.

tA hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles
twith a small microphone.

tMalloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape. He is
tyoung, half-shaven, dressed in T-shirt and jeans. He
tlooks too -

tLOUIS, who stands by the window, looking out on the
tstreet, with his back to Malloy. Louis is dressed in an
told-fashioned suit.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttSo you want me to tell you the
ttstory of my life...

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttThat's what I do. I interview
ttpeople. I collect lives. F.M.
ttradio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed
tta genuine hero, a cop who -

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttt(quietly interrupting)
ttYou'd have to have a lot of tape
ttfor my story. I've had a very
ttunusual life.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttSo much the better. I've got a
ttpocket full of tapes.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou followed me here, didn't you?

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttSaw you in the street outside. You
ttseemed interesting. Is this where
ttyou live?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttIt's just a room...

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttSo shall we begin?
ttt(playfully, almost
tttteasing)
ttWhat do you do?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI'm a vampire.

tMalloy laughs.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttSee? I knew you were interesting.
ttYou mean this literally, I take it?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttAbsolutely. I was watching you
ttwatching me. I was waiting for you
ttin that alleyway. And then you
ttbegan to speak.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttWell, what a lucky break for me.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttPerhaps lucky for both of us.

tStill in shadow he turns from the window and approaches
tthe table.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI'll tell you my story. All of it.
ttI'd like to do that very much.

tMalloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure,
tfascinated but afraid.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttYou were going to kill me? Drink my
ttblood?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYes but you needn't worry about
ttthat now. Things change.

tLouis stands opposite, hand on the chair. Malloy is
triveted.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttYou believe this, don't you? That
ttyou're a vampire? You really
ttthink...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWe can't begin this way. Let me
ttturn on the light.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttBut I thought vampires didn't like
ttthe light.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWe love it. I only wanted to
ttprepare you.

tLouis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb.


<b>tLOUIS' FACE
</b>
tAppears inhumanly white, eyes glittering. Inhuman or
tnot alive. the effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttGood God!

tHe struggles to suppress fear and understand.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDon't be frightened. I want this
ttopportunity.

tThe light appears to go out by itself and suddenly
tLouis is in the chair, dimly lit by the street-light
tfrom the window. The cassette is turning.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttHow did you do that?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThe same way you do it. A series of
ttsimple gestures. Only I moved too
ttfast for you to see. I'm flesh and
ttblood, you see. But not human. I
tthaven't been human for two hundred
ttyears.

tMalloy is speechless, frightened yet enthralled.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhat can I do to put you at ease?
ttShall we begin like David
ttCopperfield? I am born, I grow up.
ttOr shall we begin when I was born
ttto darkness, as I call it. That's
ttreally where we should start, don't
ttyou think?

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttYou're not lying to me, are you?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhy should I lie? 1791 was the year
ttit happened. I was twenty-four -
ttyounger than you are now.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttBut times were different then. I
ttwas a man at that age. The master
ttof a large plantation just south of
ttNew Orleans...

<b>ttttttttt DISSOLVE
</b><b>ttttttttt TO:
</b>

<b>tEXT. LOUISIANA - DAY (1791)
</b>
tA disheveled Louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket
tfrock coat, rides his horse through the fields of
tindigo, passing an overseer and slaves at work.

tHe passes slave quarters and the distant colonial
tmansion of Pointe du Lac.

tHe comes to a small parish church and a graveyard. he
tdismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate
tone in Greek Style.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttI had just lost my wife in
ttchildbirth. She and the infant had
ttbeen buried less than half a year.

tThere is a marble angel above the tomb, feminine, with
ta tiny cherub angel in her arms. Louis looks from the
tangel, down to the inscriptions on the tomb:

<b>t"DIANNE DE POINTE DU LAC 1763 - 1791
</b><b>tINFANT JEAN MARIE - 1791"
</b>
tLouis rips away the vines already covering the
tinscription, then drinks from a pocket-flask. His face
tis ashen.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttI was twenty-four and life seemed
ttfinished. I couldn't bear the pain
ttof their loss. I longed for a
ttrelease from it.


<b>tINT. WATERFRONT TAVERN - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between
ttwo whores at a gaming table, drinking absinthe. All
taround him flatboatmen, whores, gamblers, black African
tfreedmen.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttI wanted to lose everything. My
ttwealth, my estate, my sanity. But
ttLady Luck didn't oblige.

tLouis displays a hand of four aces. A gambler at the
ttable stands in fury, over turning money, cards,
tdrinks.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou're calling me a cheat?

<b>ttttGAMBLER
</b>ttI'm calling you a piece of shit -

tThe Gambler pulls out a pearl-handled pistol and points
tit at Louis. The crowd hushes and draws back. Louis
tsmiles drunkenly and stands. he rips open his lace
tshirt, exposing his chest.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThen do me a favor. Get rid of this
ttpiece of shit...

tThe Gambler's finger on the trigger. His hand shakes.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou lack the courage of your
ttconvictions, sir. Do it.

tLESTAT, a hooded figure in the corner, smiles from
tbeneath the shadow of his hood. Gleaming blue eyes.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttMost of all I longed for death. I
ttknow that now. I invited it, a
ttrelease from the pain of living...

tThe Gambler lowers his gun, scowling. Louis pockets the
tfistfulls of coins he has won.


<b>tEXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT
</b>
tLoud, crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians.
tLouis staggers down, an arm around a whore, drinking
tfrom a bottle. A pockmarked pimp follows behind.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttMy invitation was open to anyone.
ttSailors, thieves, whores and
ttslaves...


<b>tEXT. WHARF - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis, quite insensible, being propped up against a
twall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water. The
tpimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to
tslice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. He
tturns, and we see the face of Lestat, who lifts him
tinto the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the
twhore screams and Lestat's other hand clamps over her
tmouth. Lestat drags her towards him. Louis falls to the
tground, supported no more, insensible. Close on his
tface, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore,
toff.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttBut it was a vampire that accepted.


<b>tIN THE WATER
</b>
tThe bodies of the thief and whore float by. Above on
tthe wharf, Louis, now awake, stares down at them. He
tturns, to see Lestat, towering above him.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThey would have killed you -

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThen my luck would have changed.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou want death? Is it death you
ttwant?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYes...

tLestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the
tair, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his
tteeth in his neck.


<b>tON LOUIS' FACE
</b>
tEvery muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is
tdrained from him.


<b>tON THEIR FEET
</b>
tHovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers.

tTHE WIND billows through the ghostly white sails and
trigging of the boats around the wharf.


<b>tLESTAT
</b>
tFloats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his
tblood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging
tfrom a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws
this teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou still want death? Or have you
tttasted it enough?

tLouis can barely get the words out.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttEnough...

tLestat smiles and lets him go. Louis falls and plummets
tinto the water below.


<b>tLOUIS' FACE
</b>
tComing to the surface, in the water lapping by the
twharf. The bodies of the whore and thief float beside
thim. He looks up and sees Lestat way above him,
tdangling from the rope of the shipmast.


<b>tINT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO
</b>
<b>tON MALLOY'S FACE
</b>
tCaptivated, terrified, enthralled.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttThat's how it happened?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttNo. The Gift of Darkness requires
ttmore than that, as you'll see.


<b>tEXT. WATERFRONT - DAY
</b>
tLouis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish,
tthe carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish.
tHe gets to his feet and walks weakly through the
tmudflats. The sun is coming up over the sea behind him.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttHe left me half dead that morning.
tthe wanted something from me. He
ttcame back the following night.


<b>tINT. LAVISH FRENCH-FURNISHED BEDROOM AT POINT DU LAC
</b>
tLouis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with
tmosquito netting. A female slave, YVETTE, bathes his
tface with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover
tin the shadows. Yvette puts out all candles save one by
tthe bed, and withdraws, with the others.

tCandlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin.

tLouis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring
tincoherently. Then he opens his eyes.

tLESTAT, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands
tby the bed smiling. In the light of the candle we see
tthat he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright.
tLestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible
t- and angel or monster.

tLouis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWho the hell are you? What are you
ttdoing in my house?

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttAnd a beautiful house it is too.
ttYours is a good life, isn't it?

tLouis takes aim. Lestat puts his hand over the barrel.
tLouis fires. The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand.
tLestat is unfazed. He takes the gun from Louis' hand
tand throws it away. His hand begins to heal.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou're not afraid of anything, are
ttyou?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhy should I be?

tLouis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and
tpoint it. Lestat laughs indulgently. He draws closer.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttAre you going to put that through
ttme too? Ruin my beautiful clothes?

tHe comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the
tsword passes through his waistcoat.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttWere all last night's promises for
ttnothing?

tHe reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out
tthe sword.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhat do you want from me?

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttI've come to answer your prayers.
ttYou want to die, don't you? Life
tthas no meaning anymore, does it?

tLestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. Louis
tis becoming spellbound.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThe wine has no taste. The food
ttsickens you. There seems no reason
ttfor any of it, does there? But what
ttif I could give it back to you?
ttPluck out the pain and give you
ttanother life? And it would be for
ttall time? And sickness and death
ttcould never touch you again?

tThe vampire theme rises, with the sound of a heartbeat.

<b>ttttttttt DISSOLVE
</b><b>ttttttttt TO:
</b>

<b>tEXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
</b>
tThe camera drifts through the graveyard where Louis'
twife is buring. Everything is lit with an eerie glow,
tas if seen through some unearthly eye.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttVampires, that's what we are.
ttCreatures of darkness, only we see
ttit that darkness more clearly than
ttany mortal has ever seen...

tLouis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the
toverhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and
tchild. Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and
tchild.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttWouldn't it be sweet to bid pain
ttgoodbye? To wave away anguish and
ttgrief? To embrace the peace of the
ttunending night?

tThe marble fingers of the child on the statue move. The
tangel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife,
tDiane. she raises her hand and touches Louis tear-
tstreamed face. The child speaks.

<b>ttttMARBLE CHILD
</b>ttPapa...

tLouis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself
ttouching cold marble. He cries out in anguish-

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDiane!!!!

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThey are gone, Louis. Death took
ttthem. Death which you can now
ttdestroy...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b><b>ttNO!!!!!
</b>

<b>tINT. LOUIS BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis, thrashing on the bed in a delirium. Lestat
tplaces a hand on his forehead and soothes him.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou have to ask me for this. You
tthave to want it, do you hear me?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttGive it to me!!!

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttVampires. We thrive on blood.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI want it!

tLestat bends close as if to drink Louis' blood. Louis
tdoes not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. Lestat
tdraws back, then stands up and goes to the French
tdoors.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttTomorrow night. You must prove
ttyourself. I will give you the
ttchoice I never had.

tHe looks outside.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThe sun's coming up. Watch it
ttcarefully. If you come with me
tttomorrow, you'll never see it
ttagain.

tHe leaves. Louis sits dazed, staring at the empty
tFrench window. The sun rises with unnatural beauty,
tover the swamplands and the plantation, filling the
troom, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the
tpicture of his dead wife.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttMy last sunrise. That morning I was
ttnot yet a vampire, and I saw my
ttlast sunrise. I remember it
ttcompletely, yet I don't remember
ttany sunrise before it. I watched
ttthe whole magnificence of the dawn
ttfor the last time, as if it were
ttthe first. And the I said goodbye
ttto sunlight and went out to become
ttwhat I became.


<b>tEXT. PLANTATION - NIGHT
</b>
tLestat and Louis walk through the slave quarters,
thuddles groups around fires, music, singing. The sound
tof whipping is heard.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYour grief has unhinged you. You've
ttlet your estate rot.

tIn the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is
twhipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou let your overseer run riot,
ttwork your slaves to the bone. We'll
ttstart with him.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttHow do you mean, start?

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttCall him.

tLouis calls.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttCarlos!!!

tThe overseer turns and comes towards them, with the
tbloodied whip.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttWhy the bloody whip, Carlos?

tThe overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror,
tdrops the whip and runs for the trees. Lestat is on him
tin an instant. He sinks is teeth in his neck. Louis
truns to him, tries to pull him off. But Lestat turns to
tLouis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttLet's call that a start.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI can't do it.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou've just done it -

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttKill me if you will, but I can't do
ttthis...

tHe flees, as Lestat ends to finish off the overseer.


<b>tEXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis running up the steps leading to the gallery. He
tis crazed with guilt. He looks up and sees -


<b>tLESTAT
</b>
tSitting collected at the head of the steps.


<b>tLOUIS
</b>
tBacks away as Lestat rises and descends the steps so
tfluidly he hardly seems to move.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttDon't worry. He was white trash,
ttthey come at two a penny. I dumped
tthim in the swamp and untied the
ttslave, licked his wounds clean.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou're the devil, aren't you?
ttThat's who you are.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttt(gently)
ttI wish I were. But if I were, what
ttwould I want with you?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI can't go through with it, I tell
ttyou.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYour perfect. Your bitter and
ttyou're strong.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttBut why do you want me?

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttBecause you're as strong as I was
ttwhen I was alive.

tLouis takes out his flask and drinks. Drunkenly, he
tturns and heads for a nearby swamp.


<b>tEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis stops again in front of the crypt. Drinks from
tthe flask, leans his forehead against the stone.

tLestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou really want to be with them?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYes. Kill me. Kill me like you
ttpromised -

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou asked for death. I didn't
ttpromise it -

tIn a quiet rage, Lestat raise his fist and shatters the
tmarble face stone, revealing a coffin below. His fist
tshatters that in turn, revealing the half-rotted body
tof a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable
tas individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair,
tflesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over
tit.

tLouis gasps.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttIt's not your wife and child my
ttfriend. It's death. Just that
ttsimple. Think and choose. It
tthappens to everyone. Except us.

tLestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy
tdreamlike vision, then hyperclear. Louis again is
tspellbound. He drops the flask, which shatters on the
tstones.

tLestat appears angelic in his radiance.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttWe shall be this way always, my
ttfriend. Young as we are now. I'm
ttlonely for a companion, lonely for
ttyour strength. But I'm not that
ttlonely. Do you want to come or not?

tLouis capitulates in one long sigh.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYes...

tLestat comes closer, smiling.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttDid I hear a yes?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYes...

tLestat embraces Louis, obscuring his face. He drinks
this blood. We hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming
ttogether. We see Louis' face, growing paler, paler, as
this blood is drained. His eyes stare upwards, losing
ttheir focus.


<b>tLOUIS' POV
</b>
tThe moon, through hanging vines. The marble statue of
this wife and child smile at him, as if come alive. Her
thair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the
tchild's fingers reach out...


<b>tBACK TO SCENE
</b>
tLestat lets Louis fall down beside the broken crypt.
tLouis looks from the rotting bodies to Lestat above
thim. radiant. Lestat speaks gently.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttI've drained you to the point of
ttdeath. If you drink from me you
ttlive for ever. If I leave you here
ttyou die.

tLestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows Louis a
tkiss.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttNo. Don't leave me here. Give it to
ttme.

tLestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth. Fangs
tslash his own flesh, blood falls.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou're sure?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttSure...

tLouis rises to accept the first drops with his open
tmouth. Lestat gathers him up, as Louis clamps his hand
ton Lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist.

tThe VAMPIRE THEME swells.

tLestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement.
tLouis finishes, staggers away from him as if drunk.


<b>tLOUIS' POV
</b>
tVampire vision. The world is transformed, the swamp,
tthe moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all
tcome to him with unnatural clarity. He looks down with
tpity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear
tbeautiful in death now rather than repulsive. He closes
tthe lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground,
tastonished at the ease of it.

tHe turns and stares at Lestat whom he sees now with
tvampire's vision. Lestat's eyes are brighter, his
tbuttons are glimmering in the light. Everything is
tclearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and
tcolor.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttStop staring at my buttons. Didn't
ttI tell you it was going to be fun?

tLestat leads him into the swamp. Everything astonished
tLouis, as if he's never seen it before. Louis is
tsuddenly racked by shudders of pain.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou're body's dying. Pay no
ttattention. It will take twenty
ttminutes at most.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDying?

tLouis dry-retches.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttIt happens to us all.

tLestat wipes Louis' brow.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttCome, you're going to feed now.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI want a woman.

tLestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in
tLouis' ears.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThat doesn't matter anymore, Louis.
ttYou'll see. Come...


<b>tLOUIS' VAMPIRE POV - SWAMP
</b>
tSmall high ground. Camp of runaway slaves. Several
tshare a bottle of rum around the fire. A male slave
trises. A gorgeous hunk of flesh in the moonlight and
tgoes into the swamp to relieve his bladder.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThey're all beautiful now. Men,
ttwomen, the old, the young...simply
ttbecause they are alive. -

tThe slave walks towards them in the darkness. A
tcrucifix gleams round his neck.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttTake him.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThe crucifix -

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttForget the crucifix. Take him.

tLouis hesitates.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttResist no more Louis. Feed...

tThe slave looks up and sees them. Two gleaming white
tbeings standing before him with devil's eyes. The he
truns.

tLouis can resist him no more. He swoops on him with a
tvampire's rapid movement, brings him to the ground and
tsinks his teeth in his neck.

tClose on Louis feeding on the slave, the magnificent
tbody shuddering in its death-throes. Lestat stands
tabove, laughing.

tThe slave dies. Louis rises from him, drunkenly,
tengorged with blood.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhat have I done?

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou have fed. You were made for
ttthis...

tLouis looks down at the body of the slave. Lestat's
tlaughter echoes around him.

</b>ttDear God, what have I done?

tLestat laughs harder. Louis runs from him, screaming in
tanguish.


<b>tEXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis reaches his wife's grave. He falls to his knees,
tthrows back his head and bares his new fangs to the
tmoon.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDear God, what have I become????


<b>tINT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT
</b>
tMalloy stares at Louis, terrified and enthralled.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttYou said the slave had a
ttcrucifix...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttOh, that rumor about crosses?

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttYou can't look at them...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttNonsense, my friend. I can look on
ttanything I like. And I am
ttparticularly fond of looking on
ttcrucifixes.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttThe story about stakes through the
ttheart?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThe same. As you would say today...
ttBull shit.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttWhat about coffins?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttCoffins... coffins unfortunately
ttare a necessity...


<b>tEXT. MANSION - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis walks up the steps to the mansion. He looks now
tlike a fully-fledged vampire. Yvette, the slave girl
tstares at him from the open doorway. Cascades of
tharpsichord music come from the interior.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttKilling is no ordinary act. It is
ttthe experience of another's life
ttfor certain. That night I had lost
ttmy own life and taken another's. I
ttwas drowning in a sea of human
ttguilt and regret, with all the
ttheightened senses of a vampire...

tLouis enters the mansion, following the harpsichord
tmusic, as if in a dream. Yvette draws back as he
tapproaches.


<b>tINT. MANSION - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis wanders into the parlor, where Lestat is playing
tthe harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly. Louis goes to
ta full-length mirror and sees his own reflection there
t- quite the perfect vampire.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYes, that's you, my handsome
ttfriend. And you'll look that way
tttill the stars fall from heaven.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttIt can't be...

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttGive it time. You're like a man who
ttloses a limb and still imagines he
ttfeels pain. It will pass. And we
ttmust sleep now. I can feel the sun
ttapproaching.


<b>tEXT. POINTE DU LAC
</b>
tDawn spreading over the plantation.


<b>tINT. BASEMENT - POINTE DU LAC
</b>
tA brick walled storage room. Two coffins stand on the
tfloor. Lestat enters with a lantern, Louis behind.
tLestat is apprehensive and protective of Louis. He
tpulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou must get into it. It's the only
ttsafe place for you when the light
ttcomes.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttAnd if I don't?

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThe sun will destroy the blood I've
ttgiven you. Every tissue, every
ttvein. The fire in this lantern
ttcould do that too.

tLouis approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he
tpeers into it.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttDon't be afraid. In moments you'll
ttbe sleeping as soundly as you ever
ttslept. And when you awake I'll be
ttwaiting for you, and so will all
ttthe world.

tLouis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou told me something earlier. You
ttsaid you didn't have a choice. Was
ttthat true?

tLestat smiles bitterly and nods.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttSomeday I'll tell you. We have a
ttlot of time to talk to each other.
ttYou might say... we have all the
tttime we shall ever need.

tHe closes the lid.

tTotal darkness. Sounds of Louis' panicked breathing. Of
this prayer again.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDear God, what have I done?


<b>tINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis and Lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled
twith uneaten food. Lestat is going through sheafs of
tdocuments.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttI awoke the next evening to a
ttdifferent world. And I realized
ttthere are as profound differences
ttbetween vampires as between human
ttbeings...

tLestat, totting up figures on a piece of paper.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYour wealth, dear Louis, is
ttinestimable. Your income from
ttcotton alone will keep us in
ttcomfort for a century.

tLouis just stares at him.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttI sat there staring at him with
ttcontempt. He had the soul of a
ttshopkeeper, he was the sow's ear
ttout of which nothing fine could be
ttmade. I felt sadly cheated in
tthaving him as a teacher...

tLestat looks up at him and grins.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou'll get used to killing. Just
ttforget about that mortal coil.
ttYou'll become accustomed to things
ttall too quickly.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDo you think so?

tYvette enters, stands behind him, staring at Lestat
twith loathing.

<b>ttttYVETTE
</b>ttYou are not hungry, sir...

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttAu contraire, my dear. He could eat
tta horse...

tLestat laughs loudly. Louis turns and looks at Yvette.
tHer beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins
tpulsing on her neck and her hands.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttI looked at anything mortal and saw
ttall life as precious, condemning
ttall fruitless guilt and passion
ttthat would let it slip through the
ttfingers like sand...

tYvette returns his stare, troubled.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttIt was only as a vampire that I
ttcould see Yvette's beauty. Her fear
ttof me increased my desire.

tYvette reaches for his uneaten plate. Louis stops her
thand. Holds it for a beat too long, looking at the
tveins in her wrist.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI will finish it, Yvette. Now leave
ttus.

tShe turns and runs from the table. Lestat leans towards
thim.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttCan't you pretend, you fool? Don't
ttgive the game away. We're lucky to
tthave such a home.

tHis hand snakes out under the table. It comes up
tholding a large grey rat.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttPretend to drink, at least.

tHe bares his fangs and slices the rat's throat. He
tpours the blood into a crystal glass.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttSuch fine crystal shouldn't go to
ttwaste...

tHe hands the glass to Louis. Louis drinks the blood and
tstares at it in surprise, then at the dead rat on the
tfine lace tablecloth.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttI know. It gets cold so fast.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWe can live like this? Off the
ttblood of animals?

tLestat shrugs.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttI wouldn't call it living. I'd call
ttit surviving. A useful trick if
ttyou're caught for a month on a ship
ttat sea.

tLestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it
tsadly.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThere's nothing in the world now
ttthat doesn't hold some...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttFascination...

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYes. And I'm bored with this
ttprattle -

tHe throws the rat away.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttBut we can live without taking
tthuman life. It's possible.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttAnything is possible. But just try
ttit for a week. Come into New
ttOrleans and let me show you some
ttreal sport!

tHe rises. Louis follows.


<b>tEXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT
</b>
tA big, lavish drinking place with a raised stage.

tItalian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude
tcommedia dell'arte on the stage.

tPlantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs
twatch the show as tavern wenches move about.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttThis was New Orleans, a magical and
ttmagnificent place to live. In which
tta vampire, richly dressed might
ttattract no more notice in the
ttevening than hundreds of other
ttexotic creatures.

tLouis and Lestat by a table, in the shadow of a tree.
tTeresa, a tavern wench, sits on Lestat's lap, pouring
tdrinks for the two of them. She lifts a fresh glass to
tLestat's lips as he flirts with her.

<b>ttttTERESA
</b>ttCome on, mon cher. The best in the
ttcolony. Once you touch this you'll
ttnever go to any other tavern again.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou think so, cherie? But what if
ttI'd rather taste your lips?

<b>ttttTERESA
</b>ttMy lips are even sweeter still...

tShe kisses him. He lets his tongue play with hers, then
truns it down her neck. She swoons with pleasure. Then
the sinks his teeth gently in her neck, looking
tplayfully behind at Louis, who if appalled and
tfascinated.


<b>tANTICS ON THE STAGE
</b>
tLaughter rocks the tavern.

tLestat slips the pale and dead Teresa into a chair
tbeside him and folds her hands on the table. No one
tnotices. He lays gold coins on the table and touches
tLouis' knee.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttLet's get out of here!

tLestat rushes out, thrilled with himself.


<b>tEXT. TAVERN - NIGHT
</b>
tA crowded street. Louis and Lestat emerge from the
ttavern. Louis looks up at the moon.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttHave you ever been caught?

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttOf course not. It's so easy you
ttalmost feel sorry for them.

tThey walk down the crowded night street, full of ladies
tin their finery, freed slaves, whores, sailors etc.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttLestat killed two, sometimes three
tta night. A fresh young girl, that
ttwas his favorite for the first of
ttthe evening.


<b>tINT. FRENCH QUARTER MANSION - BALLROOM
</b>
tSmall orchestra plays for colonial couples in fine wig
tand garb prancing to a French minuet. Young women sit
tin chairs along the walls with their chaperones. Young
tmen stand opposite.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttBut the triumphant kill of Lestat
ttwas a young man. They represented
ttthe greatest loss to Lestat because
ttthey stood on the threshold of the
ttmaximum possibility of life.

tA youth of preternatural beauty, silhouetted against
tFrench windows. He is talking to an elegant widow,
tseated, holding two manicured poodles. Lestat stares at
tthe youth with longing.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThe trick is not to think about it.
ttSee that one? The widow St. Clair?
ttshe had that gorgeous young fop
ttmurder her husband. She's perfect
ttfor you. Go ahead.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttBut how do you know?

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttRead her thoughts.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI can't.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThe dark gift is different for each
ttof us. But one thing is true of
tteveryone. We grow stronger as we go
ttalong.

tHe leads Louis closer to them.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttTake my word for it. She blamed a
ttslave for his murder. And do you
ttknow what they did to him?

tHe smiles at the young man, who smiles in return.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttThe evildoers are easier. And they
tttaste better...


<b>tEXT. LAWNS - NIGHT
</b>
tLestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees. He
tlooks back at Louis, who holds both poodles on a
tdelicate leash, walking with the widow. The minuet
tspills from the french windows.

<b>ttttWIDOW ST. CLAIR
</b>ttNow, young man, you really amaze
ttme! I'm old enough to be your
ttgrandmother.

tShe leans towards him concquettishly. Louis, crazed
twith hunger, sees her as beautiful in the moonlight. He
tallows her lips reach his. He takes her in his arms,
tgently, romantically, and sinks in his teeth. She
tswoons.

<b>ttttWIDOW ST. CLAIR
</b>ttYes, that's the melody, I remember
ttit. Oh yes...

tLouis draws his lips away. She is weak in his arms, but
tstill alive. He can't do it. The poodles growl. He
tshoots out an arm and grabs one, then the other.


<b>tEXT. TREES - NIGHT
</b>
tLestat, bending over the body of the dead youth. A
tscream pierces the night.

<b>ttttWIDOW ST CLAIR
</b>ttMurder!!! Murderer!!


<b>tEXT. LAWNS. NIGHT
</b>
tThe widow on the grass, her poodles dead beside her.
tLouis is trying to quiet her.

<b>ttttWIDOW ST CLAIR
</b>ttMy little papillions! My
ttbutterflies!!! He killed them!!!

tLestat comes from nowhere, claps a hand over her mouth
tand breaks her neck. He spits in fury at Louis.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou whining coward of a vampire who
ttprowls the night killing rats and
ttpoodles. You could have finished us
ttboth!
<b>tt
</b>tLouis throws himself on Lestat with extraordinary
tforce, pummeling him towards the trees.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhat have you done to me? You've
ttcondemned me to hell.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttI don't know any hell -

tLouis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength
the never knew he had.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou want to see me kill? Watch me
ttkill you then -

tHe drags him to the ground an throttles him. Lestat
tlooks up at him, amazed and amused at the same time.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttWhat strength, my friend, what
ttstrength. I remember why I chose
ttyou now.

tLestat squirms from his grip, seemingly effortlessly.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttBut you can't kill me, Louis. Nor I
ttyou.

tHe ruffles Louis' hair, with wry affection.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttFeed on what you want, mon cherie.
ttRats, chickens, doves, goats. I'll
ttleave you to it and watch you come
ttround. Just remember, life without

tHe smiles. A sly, pleasurable secret secret smile.


<b>tEXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT
</b>
tTheir carriage draws up to the mansion as the first
tfingers of light spread across the sky.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttBeing a vampire to him meant
ttrevenge. Revenge against life-

ttit was revenge. and the slaves with
tta wisdom that was denied their
ttmasters, began to notice...


<b>tINT. SLAVE-HUT - NIGHT
</b>
tIn a tiny cabin, a slave family. Kids sleeping on the
tfloor, in cribs and cots. The parents sleep on the bed,
tyoung, beautiful, naked. Beside them is Lestat, who is
tdrinking the husband's blood, his hand playing across
tthe breast of the wife as he does so. She murmurs in
ther sleep.

<b>ttttWIFE
</b>ttYes... please...

tShe grabs his fingers and kisses them, thinking him to
tbe her husband. Lestat gently disengages himself and
tleaves.

tThe woman's scream pierces the sky, as Lestat walks
tinto the night.


<b>tEXT. CHICKEN-COOP - NIGHT

tEvery chicken is dead, bloodies necks hanging down from
tthe cribs. Louis emerges from the entrance, blood on

tThe sound of drumming is heard, African, primal. The

tOthers gather at doorways, restrain and console her.


<b>tEXT. DOVE-COTE - DAY
</b>
tA beautiful, elaborate eighteenth century dove-cote.
tEvery dove inside is dead, pierced at the neck. A black

tA doll, made in the image of Lestat, is pierced with
tneedles.


<b>tEXT. SWAMP BY FIELDS - DAY

tBodies of slaves floating in the swamp, with the bodies
tof goats. Slaves at the edge throw ropes around the
tbodies, pull them towards the shore. The drumming grows
tlouder.


<b>tEXT. SLAVE-QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis walking through. The slaves hush as he
tapproaches, gather in doorways and whisper. He turns
tand looks at them, sorrowfully. He looks truly like a
tghost. Their eyes turn away when they meet his. He
twalks on.


<b>tINT. DINING ROOM IN MANSION - NIGHT

tLestat and Louis sit at the table, the untouched food
tbetween them.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttConsider yourself lucky. In Paris a

tThe drumming grows outside.

</b>ttt(gripping his temples)
ttThat noise! It's driving me mad!
ttWe've been in the country for

tLouis stares. Lestat turns childishly, petulantly.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou'll soon run out of chickens,

tHe walks out, humming a French aria. Louis stares at
this plate.


<b>tEXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
tThe slaves, gathered on mass around fires. Frenzied
tdrumming, dancing. Lestat rides through, scattering the
tflames. The drumming stops. The slaves look towards the

</b>ttNo, ma cher. I need no supper. Is

tYvette draws closer. Light reveals her beauty.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttt(dazed)
ttLeave me alone now, Yvette.

<b>ttttYVETTE
</b>ttI will not go unless you listen to

tShe touches his hair. He takes her hand and brings it
tto his lips.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI am frightened of myself, Yvette.

tHe kisses her wrist. She suddenly gasps, sharply,
twithdraws her hand. She sees her wrist is red with
tblood. She sees the blood on his lips. She screams.

tLouis stands.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttHush, Yvette -

tShe screams even louder. Louis clamps his hand over her
tmouth. Her hand grips the table-cloth, pulls, bringing
tthe empty glasses and crockery to the floor.

tIn horror, Louis realizes he has broken her neck. He
tbrings her cut wrist to his lips, then drops it,

</b>ttThis place is cursed. Damned, do

</b>ttGet out while you can. You're free

tThey don't move. They stare at him blankly.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttUnlike me, you are no free men...

tHe turns behind him, and looks at the mansion, all
tcandelabra and chandeliers lighted, all windows open.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDo I have to convince you?

tHe rushed up the stairs, snatches up the candelabra and
tsets fire to the drapes. He goes from window to window,
tlighting drapes, lace curtains, everything.


<b>tSLAVES POV - MASTER
</b>
tSetting fire to the house.

tThey rush up the stairs with shouts of "STOP HIM, HE'S

<b>tINT. BURNING MANSION - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis, wandering from room to room of the burning
tmansion. he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the
tflames. He is weakening with the fumes, the heat. We
tcan see this in his face, the texture of his skin.

tSuddenly a large french window cascades inwards and
tLestat stands there, whip in hand. Behind him we can
tsee the morning sky.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou fool, what have you done?

</b>ttWhat you wouldn't do. It's almost

</b>ttCan a vampire feel love?

</b>ttYou loved your wife, surely.

tBehind, we can hear the laughter of Lestat and tow

tGradually another sound replaces it.

</b>ttAh, my philosopher, my martyr.

tlets her slip gently into a chair. Shamefully he wipes
this mouth, sees the tiny wounds on her throat.

tLestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and
tbegins to dance with her in great circles, humming and
ttalking. Her head falls back. Black water flows from

</b>ttYou always give me the doll on the

tHe examines the other dolls.

</b>ttBut you're the fairest by far.

</b>ttYou dress me like a doll. You make

tLestat doesn't answer. Claudia stands up quickly, and
tstrides out into the -

</b>
tWhere Louis is reading by the window. She walks to a
tmirrored cabinet, takes out a scissors and begins
tcutting her hair.

</b>ttYou want me to be a doll forever?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttClaudia - don't -

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttWhy not?

tShe continues cutting. She sees Lestat emerge from her
tbedroom in the mirror behind her then turns to him, an
tangelic little boy's face now with soft curls around
ther face.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttCan't I change, like everybody

tShe walks past him, back into her bedroom and slams the

tsilence. More screams, which become roars.

ttWe're immortal. You've always known

tLouis back in the same street, outside the same house.
tHe stands with Claudia at the window. There is a family
tinside, a picture of domestic tranquility.

</b>ttI had no fear. If anything I longed
ttfor something to happen, for the

tLouis walking down the nave of the church. He stops by
tthe alter.

tLouis sits in a pew.

</b>ttAnd then it struck me.

tThe cross, the statues, the tabernacle.

</b>ttWhat if the statues gave an image

ttsupernatural in this cathedral? The
ttonly immortal under this roof. And
ttI felt nothing but loneliness.
ttLoneliness to the point of madness.

tSuddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder. Louis almost
tjumps. He turns and sees the face of a grey-haired

tLouis rises. Walks out.

topen-mouthed.

</b>ttYou talk of sacrilege. Why if God

tHe bares his fangs. The priest runs, screaming. Gets to

tLouis takes him, lifting him from the floor, till his

</b>ttWe forgive each other then?

tClaudia stares at him, sitting. She nods.

tLestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks
tgreedily and horribly. Claudia watches him without
texpression. He finished one, is about to take the other
twhen he staggers. He looks at Claudia.

</b>ttAbsinthe? You gave them absinthe?

teverywhere. She plunges the knife in his chest. He
tfalls back, fangs bared, clutching the knife. Claudia
tleaps on him then, bites deep into his neck as he dies.
tLouis screams, runs forward, pulls her away.

</b>ttWhat have you done, Claudia -

</b>ttLouis! Look what's happening to

tLouis looks. The floor is a sea of blood. Lestat has
tbegun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood. His
tskin is shriveling against his bones like parchment,
this eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face.
tHis lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged. But his
tclothes are virtually being emptied of the body. It is
tno more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of
tthe eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull.

</b>ttLestat. Oh, God forgive us.

</b>ttDon't mock me, Louis. Help me.

tShe stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin

tbrings her finger to her lips.

</b>ttGoodnight, sweet prince, may

</b>ttHelp me. We must get rid of him.

tShe drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the
tcrockery over the dead youths, and wraps Lestat's
tskeleton in it. She takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and
tplaces them in his skeleton hands.

tLouis drags out the bodies of the boys. He slides them
tinto the waters of the swamp. We see ripples in the
twater and the churning of alligators, as they attack
tthe corpses. Louis takes Lestat's skeleton in his arms.
tHe slides it into the waters. The alligators speed
ttowards it.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttHe belongs with those reptiles,

</b>ttLouis, look at me.

</b>ttt(bitterly)
ttI can't. Go away from me.

tClaudia is shocked to her core. She steps back. Louis
tstares at the rippling waters. Gradually the movement
tof alligators stops. Then he hears a sound he hasn't
theard in years. Soft, choking. He turns, sees Claudia
tsitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the
tfirst time in years. She is weeping copiously.

</b>ttClaudia - You're crying -

tWe see her face, tears of blood running down it. She is

</b>ttAnd you never cried -

</b>ttI love you Claudia. Always. And we

tLestat, who fights like a ravening animal, bits of his
tbroken body coming off in the process. Then with a
tterrifying effort, Lestat hurls Louis off, goes for
tClaudia, who grabs the poker from the fireplace,
tscatters burning coals over him. He falls back, then
tcomes at her again, as the drapes catch fire. Louis
tgrabs the lamp.

tLouis throws the flaming sheets around him, wrapping

tThe ship, shrouded in mist.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttThough the ship was blessedly free

tA body is slipped into the sea. A priest reads last

</b>
tTrunks and cases, creaking with the ship's movement.
tDead rats everywhere.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttClaudia and I alone seemed immune.
ttWe kept to ourselves, pondering the

</b>
tPassing through the Straits of Gibralter.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttWe reached the Mediterranean. I
ttwanted those waters to be blue.
ttThey were black, nighttime waters
ttand how I suffered then, straining
ttto remember the color that a young
ttman's senses had taken for granted,
ttthat my memory had let slip away
ttfor eternity. It was black off the
ttcoast of Italy, black off the coast
ttof Greece, Europe itself was black.

<b>tEXT. DECK - NIGHT
</b>
tClaudia, sitting with an easel and sketch-pad,
tsketching the bay of Naples. A beautifully realized

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttLouis, your quest is for darkness

ttThey myths of men are not your

tThe sketch changes to a sketch of -

tIn the moonlight.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttWe saw the Acropolis by moonlight,

tThe sketch changes to a sketch of -

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttI think the very name of Paris

</b>
tClaudia, in furtrimmed muff and bonnet, peers through
tthe glass at a display of dolls. Each doll in there
tseems to resemble her, with blonde hair and blue eyes.
tShe peers deep into the shop and sees -

tMADELEINE, a young woman bent over a workbench painting
ta doll's face, oblivious to being watched.

tHe turns away.

tShe twirls, looking at herself in the mirror, then

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYes.

</b>ttWell tell me, papa. What was it

</b>ttYou don't remember? Or you never

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttIt was something hurries...and

</b>ttI'll never find them, will I? My

<b>tEXT. BOULEVARD - EVENING

tLouis and Claudia walk along a boulevard like father

tfamilies on their evening stroll. Claudia points at the
tchildren that pass.

</b>ttHave I anything in common with her,

tShe points to a beautiful French child walking by with

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttAll her dolls resemble me.

</b>
tClaudia's face, with the dolls in the background. The
tresemblance is uncanny.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttAre they my kind Louis? Dolls never

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou are neither, Claudia. Now stop

tMadeleine sees Claudia from inside. She waves.

</b>
tLouis walks briskly, head bowed.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttFor a time we had been almost
tthuman, in the sensual whirl of what
ttParis had to offer. But the human
ttdelights of that city only served
ttto remind her of the ageless child

ttI walked until I become aware that
ttI was being followed.


<b>tCLOSEUP - LOUIS' FEET
</b>
tWalking. A step echoes his.

tLouis stops. Turns, sees nothing. Then walks again. The
techoing steps begin again.

tLouis again. Sees a shadow, flitting.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttClaudia!

tNothing. He walks again, hears the same effect. Then he
tstops. He stares at a gaslamp opposite.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttSo it was when I had given up the
ttsearch for vampires that a vampire
ttfound me...

tSantiago, a tall vampire, materializes under the
tgaslight. And Louis gradually realizes that this
tvampire has assumed the same attitude, posture, clothes
tand hair-style as Louis.

tLouis gives an involuntary shake of the head. Santiago
tmimics. Louis takes a step forwards. Santiago mimics.
tLouis folds his arms. Santiago mimics.

<b>ttttLOUIS & STATIAGO
</b>ttt(simultaneously)
ttClever.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou mean me harm?

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttt(a beat later)
ttYou mean me harm?

tLouis calculates.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttTrickster. Buffoon!

tSantiago echoes the first word, but not the second.
tLouis has broken his composure. He turns his back on
tSantiago, only to come face to face with Santiago right
tin front of him.

tAgain Louis turns this back to find Santiago facing
thim.

tLouis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI've searched the world for an
ttimmortal and this is what I find?

tSlowly he looks up. Santiago draws close, breaking the
tmirror trick and suddenly slams Louis back against the
twall.

tLouis is furious. He regains his balance, strikes out
tat Santiago and when Santiago vanishes, to reappear
tbehind him, Louis slams back his elbow into his
tmidriff. Santiago staggers, amazed and then rushes at
tLouis, throwing him down.

tLouis rolls back to his feet, then to his amazement
tsees two vampires, on in front, on behind. He looks
tboth ways, then sees one has vanished. He stares,
tawestruck, at this new one:

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttHe looks like an angel.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttYou are all right.

tHe reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved
tinvitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at Louis.

tLouis reads it aloud, as we see:

<b>t"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES
</b>tBy Special Invitation
tFriday, 9 p.m."

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttBring the petit beauty with you. No
ttone will harm you. I won't allow
ttit. Remember my name. Armand.

tArmand bows and vanishes.

tLouis listens to the silence.


<b>tEXT BOULEVARD DES CAPUCHINES - THEATRE DES VAMPIRES -

</b>
tLouis formally dressed with Claudia in rich attire on
this arm. They pass people buying tickets for the
ttheatre and go inside.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttRemember what I've told you.
ttThey'll have different powers.
ttThey'll read your thoughts if you
ttallow it.

tThey draw close to:


<b>tHUGE POSTERS
</b>
tReading -

<b>t"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES PRESENTS
</b><b>tTHE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH
</b>tBy Edgar Allen Poe"

tThe posters are illustrated with cliched images of
tvampires overcoming damsels in distress.


<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttBut this can't be real. This is
ttnonsense.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttNonsense all right. But something
tttell me it's going to be the
ttstrangest nonsense we've ever seen.

tWarily, they show their invitations to the mortal
tticket taker at the door. He glances away
tindifferently.


<b>tINT. THEATRE BOX - NIGHT
</b>
tClaudia and Louis look at the crowd as the lights go
tdown.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttMortals, mortals everywhere. And
ttlots of drops to drink.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThey are here. I know they are.
ttListen for something that doesn't
ttmake a sound.

tStage: curtain rises.

tAn elaborate painted set of an Italianate castle. Death
tstanding before it, the traditional image of the Grim
tReaper, complete with magnificent scythe.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttt(whispers)
ttIt's a vampire. It's the one I saw
ttin Rue St Jacques.

tA version of the Poe story unfolds before them. All of
tthe participants are vampires. All beautiful gleaming
twhite, aged 20 or 30.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThey use no paint. And the audience
ttthink it is paint.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttHow devilishly clever.

tA spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out
tupon the stage.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttShe's no vampire.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttNo. She's frightened. She doesn't
ttknow where she is.

tThe audience laughs uneasily, then stops as the Mortal
tWoman comes into the footlights. She is too beautiful,
ttoo confused. Santiago, as Death, advances on her. She
tbacks away, terrified, then sees the other vampires, in
ta phalanx, advancing from behind, in a half-circle.

<b>ttttMORTAL WOMAN
</b>ttI don't want to die!

tShe looks around in panic. Santiago swoons, arms over
this breast as if he is hopelessly in love.

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttWe are death!

tThe Mortal Woman steps to the footlights.

<b>ttttMORTAL WOMAN
</b>ttSomeone help me. Please... What
tthave I done?

tLouis whispers to Claudia.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThis is no performance.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttAnd no one knows but us...


<b>tON THE STAGE
</b>
<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttWe all die. Death is the one thing
ttyou share with all those here.

tSantiago gestures to the audience.


<b>tAUDIENCE
</b>
tRapt faces.


<b>tON THE STAGE
</b>
<b>ttttMORTAL WOMAN
</b>ttBut I'm young...

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttDeath is no respecter of age. He
ttcan come any time, any place. Need
ttI tell you what fate has in store
ttfor you?

<b>ttttMORTAL WOMAN
</b>ttI would take my chance. Let me go!
ttPlease...

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttAnd if you take that chance and
ttlive, what is your fate? The
tthumpbacked toothless visage of old
ttage?

tSantiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of
ther peasant blouse. It opens completely and starts to
tslip. She tries to catch it, but gently stops her
twrists. The blouse falls, exposing her young breasts.


<b>tLOUIS AND CLAUDIA
</b>
<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThis is monstrous!

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttYes, and very beautiful.


<b>tON THE STAGE

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttJust as this flesh is pink now, it

<b>ttttMORTAL WOMAN
</b>ttLet me live, please. I don't care.

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttThen why should you care if you die
ttnow?

tShe shakes her head, confused. he catches her wrists
tbehind her back.


<b>tAUDIENCE
</b>
tIs awestruck by her beauty, her suffering.


<b>tSANTIAGO
</b>
tDraws near her cheek.

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttAnd suppose death had a heart to
ttlove and to release you? To whom
ttwould he turn his passion? Would
ttyou pick a person from the crowd
ttthere? A person to suffer as you
ttsuffer?


<b>tAUDIENCE
</b>
tA young girl cries out in jest.

<b>ttttYOUNG GIRL
</b>ttOh, yes, take me Monsieur Vampire!
ttI adore you!

tAudience roars with laughter.


<b>tON THE STAGE
</b>
<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttYou wait your turn.

tThe audience laughs again.

tThe Mortal Woman shakes her head in panic.

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttWell, have you a sister, a mother,
tta daughter you would send in your
ttplace?


<b>tCLOSE ON CLAUDIA
</b>
tEven she is repelled by the cruelty. She shakes her
thead.


<b>tMORTAL WOMAN
</b>
tShakes her head. She is helpless.

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttWe alone can give death meaning. Do
ttyou know what it means to be loved
ttby death, to become our bride?

tMortal Woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or
tfainting. But then her eyes mist over. She is being
tentranced.


<b>tFROM HER POV
</b>
tWe realize she is looking past Santiago at the divinely
tbeautiful Armand, who has just stepped out of the
twings. Armand has entranced her. He passes Santiago.
tSantiago stiffens, but yields the stage.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttNo pain.

<b>ttttMORTAL WOMAN
</b>ttNo pain?

tArmand takes her by the naked shoulders.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttYour beauty is a gift to us.


<b>tON THE STAGE
</b>
tArmand gestures to the others who slowly, gracefully
tclose in.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttWho deserves such a gift?

tHe pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls
trevealing her nakedness. But she is spellbound.

<b>ttttMORTAL WOMAN
</b>ttNo pain...

tArmand embraces her, drinks, her naked body stark
tagainst her black clothes, then he passes her to the
tother vampires one by one.


<b>tCLOSE ON LOUIS
</b>
tWho battles desire and hunger with anger.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI've seen enough of this! I loathe
ttit!

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttBe still!


<b>tON THE STAGE
</b>
tThe naked Mortal Woman lies dead on the floor. The
tvampires seem to vanish one by one. As the curtain
tdraws across, the Audience loudly applauds what they
tpresume are theatrical tricks.


<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tThe audience, milling towards the exits. They talk in
tvacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the
tsymbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave.

tGradually Louis and Claudia are left alone in the empty
ttheatre. Louis seems anxious to leave. Claudia whispers
tin his ear.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttPatience, Louis. Patience.

tHe looks around the empty theatre, more eerie now than
twhen the play was on. The red curtain shifts slightly
tin a hidden breeze, a candle sputters and dies in a
tbox. Then the candle flares again, and we see Armand in
tthe box, looking down on them. He stares with a dreamy
texpression, saying nothing.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWe've been searching for you for a
ttvery long time...

tHis voice echoes eerily. Armand gestures for them to
tfollow him.


<b>tINT. FOOT OF STAIRWAY
</b>
tArmand leading, Louis and Claudia following. It opens
tinto a -


<b>tHUGE UNDERGROUND BALLROOM
</b>
tWalls are painted with famous copies of Durer,
tBrueghel, Goya and Bosch depictions of death. Fine
twooden coffins line the walls. Candles burn in sconces,
tcasting alternate shadows and pools of light. Armand
twalks through, gesturing Louis and Claudia to follow
thim.

tAs they walk through, vampire man and women appear out
tof the shadows like wraiths, startling them, drifting
taround them, stroking them, touching Claudia as if she
twere a doll. Shrieks of preternatural laughter.

tArmand gestures to the vampires to back off.

tAll obey but ESTELLE.

<b>ttttESTELLE
</b>ttSuch a darling.

tShe menaces Claudia, her breasts enormous, her fangs
tbared. Armand throw her a look, and she is flung
tagainst the wall.

tLouis stares around. The vampires faces drift towards
thim and away, always disclosing the face of Armand, who
tseems some distance away, but strangely close, staring
tat Louis with a constantly calm, hypnotic gaze. Then a
tyoung mortal boy comes from the shadows with a
tcandelabra, which he hands to Armand.

tArmand and the boy come towards them, leading them
talong the walls, his candelabra illuminating the
tghastly murals, his face gleaming like an angel above
tthe candleflame.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttMonstrous.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttYes, and very beautiful.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYour lips, they didn't move.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttThey did, but too fast for you to
ttsee them. No magic, just grace and
ttspeed.

tThe boy is watching Louis. Armand's hand beckons and
tthe boy draws up to Louis in the candlelight. He places
this arms on Louis' shoulders. Louis glances at Armand,
twho smiles. Louis sees the puncture marks on the boy's
tneck.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttHe wants you...

tLouis is utterly confused. Can't resist. Drinks his
tblood.

tThe boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing.
tThe other vampires appear all around Louis, who
tsuddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed.

tClaudia watches warily, from a distance. Armand beckons
tat her and Louis and open a door in the wall which
treveals a stone staircase.


<b>tINT. MEDIEVAL ROOM
</b>
tMedieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one
tcorner, a blazing fire. A medieval painting of Satan,
tbeing banished from heaven, above the fire. Armand
tplaces the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttDisappointing, isn't it? To come so
ttfar and find so little. Jaded
ttingenues, amusing themselves with
ttmake- believe...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWe had feared we were the only
ttones...

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttBut how did you come into
ttexistence?

tHe glances at Louis, then at Claudia, who averts her
teyes.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttYou don't want to answer... Two
ttvampires from the new world, come
ttto guide us into the new era as all
ttwe love slowly rots and fades away.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttAre you the leader of this group?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttIf there were a leader, I would be
ttthe one.

tClaudia stares at him constantly, guarded.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttSo you have the answers...

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttAh! You have questions?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhat are we?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttNothing if not vampires...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWho made us what we are?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttSurely you know the one who made
ttyou...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttBut the one who made him, who made
ttthe one who made him, the source of
ttall this evil...

tLouis looks at the picture. Armand watches him.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttThat is a picture, nothing more.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou mean we are not children of
ttSatan?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttNo.

tHe smiles at Louis. A smile of infinite compassion.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttI understand. I saw you in the
tttheatre, your suffering, your
ttsympathy for that girl. I saw you
ttwith the boy. You die when you
ttkill, you feel you deserve to die
ttand you stint on nothing. But does
ttthat make you evil? Or, since you
ttcomprehend what you call goodness,
ttdoes it not make you good?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThen there is nothing.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttPerhaps...

tHe passes his finger through the candle flame.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttAnd perhaps this is the only real
ttevil left...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThen God does not exist...

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttI have not spoken to him...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttAnd no vampire here has discourse
ttwith God or the Devil?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttNone that I've ever known. I know
ttnothing of God or the Devil, I have
ttnever seen a vision nor learnt a
ttsecret that would damn or save my
ttsoul. And as far as I know, after
ttfour hundred years I am the oldest
ttliving vampire in the world.

tHe stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young.
tHis eyes hold them both in a trance.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttMy God... So it's as I always
ttfeared. Nothing, leading to
ttnothing.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttYou fell too much. So much you make
ttme feel...

tHe stares from Claudia to Louis. He seems to be reading
ttheir souls.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttThe one who made you should have
tttold you this. The one who left the
ttold world for the new...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttHe knew nothing. He just didn't
ttcare.

tinterrupting.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttCome, beloved. It's time we were on
ttour way. I'm hungry and the city
ttwaits.

tShe stares hard at Armand. Armand looks from her to
tLouis.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttSo soon to go?

tHe seems genuinely regretful. But Claudia pulls Louis
tout.


<b>tINT. DARKENED CORRIDORS AND THEATRE - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis and Claudia feel their way through darkened
tcorridors, trying to find their way out.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttThe place was dark as we left, a
ttdarkness that confounded even
ttClaudia. And as we blundered
ttthrough it, again came the thought:
ttI have wronged Lestat, I have hated
tthim for the wrong reasons.

tSuddenly a light comes on. They see they are in the
tempty theatre. Santiago stands on the stage, under a
tcandle.

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttHow did you wrong him?

tLouis is stunned.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou read my thoughts?

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttYou said a name -

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttA name I don't want to say again.

</b>ttI seemed to recognize it...

tOther vampires appear behind him.

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttThere is but one crime among us

tHe looks at Claudia.

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttYou should know, who are so
ttsecretive about the vampire who
ttmade you.

tClaudia laughs.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttBoredom!

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttIt is the crime that means death to
ttany vampire. To kill your own kind!

<b>ttttCLAUDIA

ttwe were! Come Louis, let's go!

</b>
tClaudia and Louis enter the Lobby.

</b>ttI loathe them! I can't stand the

ttsearched for them the world over
ttand I despise them!

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhat danger?

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttI can feel it from them! They want
ttto know who made us, what became of

tLouis closes the door behind him. Claudia paces.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDo you think I would let them harm
ttyou?

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttNo, you would not, Louis. Danger

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttLove holds you to me. And we are in

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttLove?

tShe smiles at him. A strange, sad, adult smile.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttYou would leave me for Armand if he
ttbeckoned you.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttNever.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttHe wants you as you want him. He's
ttbeen waiting for you. He wants you
ttfor a companion. He bides his time
ttthat place. he finds them as dull
ttand lifeless as we do.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThat's not so.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttDo you know what his soul said to

</b>ttSo you felt it too!

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttLet him go, he said. Let him go.

tShe touches his face.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttIs that what I should do Louis? Let
ttyou go? My father? My lover? My
ttLouis, who made me?

tThere are tears in her eyes. Louis lifts her up in his

</b>ttHe can protect us, Claudia.

</b>
tArmand opens the door to Louis' knock.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttI was waiting for you...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttListen to me.

tHe follows Armand into the room.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttClaudia is dear to me. My...

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttYour lover.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttNo, my beloved, my child.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttIf you say so. You are innocent.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI'm not innocent. But I'm afraid.
ttShe feels she's in danger from the
ttothers.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttShe is.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttBut why?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttI could give you reasons. Her
ttsilence. Her youth. It's forbidden
ttto make so young, so helpless, that
ttcannot survive on its own.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThen blame the one who made her...

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttDid you kill this vampire who made
ttyou both? Is that why you won't say
tthis name? Santiago thinks you did.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWe want no quarrel with him.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttIt's already begun. If you want to

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThen I leave too.

tArmand smiles.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttSo soon? Without any of those
ttanswers you so longed for?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou said there were none.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttBut you asked the wrong questions.
ttDo you know how few vampires have
ttthe stamina for immortality? How
ttquickly they perish of their own
ttwill.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWe can do that?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttYou would never give up life. If
ttthe world were reduced to one empty
ttcell, on fragile candle, you stay

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThat's what the one who made me
ttsaid.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttHow he must have loved you.

tArmand suddenly grips Louis close to him.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttLouis, I need you more than he ever
ttdid. I need a link with this
ttcentury. The world changes. We do
ttnot. Therein lies the irony that
ttultimately kills us. I need you to
ttmake contact with this age.

tLouis laughs bitterly.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttHe? Don't you see? I'm not the
ttspirit of any age! I'm at odds with
tteverything and always have been!
ttI'm not even sure what I am!

tArmand smiles.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttBut Louis, that is the very spirit
ttof your age. The heart of it. You
ttfall from grace has been the fall
ttof a century.

tLouis is stunned.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttAnd the vampires of the Theatre?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttLike moths around the candle of the
ttage. Decadent, useless. They can't
ttreflect anything. But you do. You
ttreflect its broken heart.

tLouis is speechless.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttAre these not the answers you came
ttfor?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttt(softly)
ttYes... My God...

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttA vampire with a human soul. An

ttYou are beautiful, my friend.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttLestat! You knew Lestat!

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttYes I knew him. Knew him well
ttenough not to mourn his passing.

tArmand stands. He takes Louis by the arm, leads him
ttowards the back wall.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttBut you must go now. You must get

tHe opens a hidden door in the wall.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttI felt a kind of peace at last. I
tthad found the teacher which Lestat
ttcould never, I knew now, have been.
ttI knew knowledge would never be

ttthrough him as through a pane of
ttglass. And I knew Claudia must

<b>tINT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis enters. There is unfamiliar scent in the air, a
tdoll sitting by the mirror. Louis looks in the mirror
tand sees...


<b>tMADELEINE
</b>
tThe doll-maker, resplendent in green taffeta, sitting
tlike a Madonna with Claudia on her lap. Claudia's arms
tare wound round her neck. The contrast between mortal
twoman and immortal child is plain.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttMadeleine... Louis is shy.

tMadeleine rises and comes towards Louis. She draws back
tthe lace fringes round her throat, so he can see the
ttwo marks there. She says softly, dreamily.

<b>ttttMADELEINE
</b>ttDrink.

tLouis turns away. Claudia speaks, icy, from the bed.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttDo it Louis. Because I cannot do
ttit. I haven't the strength. You saw
ttto that when you made me.

tLouis turns to Madeleine.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou haven't the vaguest conception
ttunder God of what you ask!

<b>ttttMADELEINE
</b>ttAu contraire, monsieur, I have.

tLouis pushes her away. Claudia screams.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttYou have found your new companion,
ttLouis! You will make me mine!

tLouis grips Madeleine and shakes her.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttHow do we seem to you? Do you think
ttus beautiful, magical, our white
ttskin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you
ttask me! Have you any idea of the
ttthing you will become?

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttYour evil is that you cannot be
ttevil! And I will suffer for it no

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDon't make me, Claudia! I cannot do
ttit!

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttYet you could do it to me!
ttSnatching me from my mother's hands

ttCouldn't you have waited? Six more

tShe points to Madeleine

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttYou give her to me! Do this before

tShe begins to weep, sobbing like a child.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttOh God! I love you still, that's

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYes...

</b>ttYou promise to care for her then?

<b>ttttMADELEINE
</b>ttYes...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttAnd you know what you ask for?

tShe wraps her arms around Claudia.

<b>ttttMADELEINE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhat do you think she is,
ttMadeleine? A doll?

<b>ttttMADELEINE
</b>ttA child who can't die...

tHer finger clutches a locket around her neck, Louis
ttouches it, opens it.


<b>tTHE LOCKET
</b>
tA picture of a young girl, Claudia's age, wistful,
tbeautiful.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttt(softly)
ttAnd the child who did die?

<b>ttttMADELEINE
</b>ttMy daughter...

tLouis takes her chin in his hand, gently.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttLook at the gaslight. Don't take
ttyour eyes off it. You will be
ttdrained to the point of death, but
ttyou must stay alive. Do you hear
ttme?

<b>ttttMADELEINE
</b>ttYes!

tLouis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood.


<b>tEXT. HOTEL BALCONY - LATER
</b>
tLouis on the balcony, weakened terribly. A breeze blows
ton the gauze curtains behind him, through which we
tsee...

tSILHOUETTES of Madeleine and Claudia. Madeleine her
tarms outstretched, now a vampire, a long moan of pain
tcoming from her. Claudia comes through the curtains,
talarmed.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttt(whispers)
ttLouis!

tLouis speaks without turning.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttShe is dying. It happened to you
tttoo, but your child's mind can't
ttremember.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttBut if she dies...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttIt's only mortal death.

tHe turns to look at Claudia.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttBear me no ill will, my love. We
ttare now even.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhat died tonight inside that room
ttwas not that woman. It will take
tther many nights to die, perhaps
ttyears. What has died in that room
tttonight is the last vestige in me
ttof what was human.

tShe takes his hand.

<b>ttttCLAUDIA
</b>ttYes father. At last. We are een.

tHe bends down and kisses her. He looks up, at the
twafting curtains. He sees -


<b>tMANY VAMPIRE SHADOWS
</b>
tSilhouetted, coming closer.


<b>tCLAUDIA
</b>
tLooks up and screams.


<b>tTHE CURTAINS
</b>
tAre ripped aside. The vampires of the Theatre surge
tthrough.

<b>ttttESTELLE
</b>ttTime for justice, little one.

tThe vampires close on them as Louis struggles,
tClaudia's scream pierces the night air.

tIn a press of vampires, Louis, Claudia and Madeleine
tare forced down the dark corridor. Into -

tVampire chaos, as they are dragged through. Louis
tstruggling like a demon.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttArmand! Get me Armand! he wouldn't
ttcountenance this -

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttYou can make no demands here!
ttBuffoon! Bastard -

tSantiago strikes Louis to the ground. As he struggles
tto his feet, he sees the vampires part around a figure
tcoming through. He gasps at the sight of -


<b>tLESTAT
</b>
tDressed beautifully, but horribly scarred now, from the
tfire as well as the earlier stabbing. Lestat is
tconfused, ancient, teetering, reaching for Santiago's
tshoulder to steady himself.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttLouis...

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttIs he the one?

tLestat shakes his head.

</b>ttAll the murderers!!!

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou are alive, Lestat! It can't be

</b>ttThe sentence is death! To all of

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttOnly the girl - it was the girl -

tThe sound of something being dragged through the crowd.

</b>ttYou promised me - I could take him
ttback to New Orleans - Louis -
ttthere's something I must tell you -

tSantiago grabs Louis by the neck.

</b>ttDeath for the others. For you

tcoffin being dragged through the vampires. Claudia
tscreams.

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttWalled in a dungeon. Your only
ttcompany will be your screams...
ttPerhaps it will take centuries...

tThe vampires grab Louis. They force him towards the
tcoffin. Lestat struggles with them.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttHe's coming home with me - you
ttpromised -

<b>ttttSANTIAGO
</b>ttt(laughing)
ttWe promised nothing!

tLouis struggles fiercely as he is forced into the
tcoffin. Claudia weeps.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThey've fooled you, Lestat! You
ttmust reach Armand! Armand has the
ttpower!

tLouis, struggling in the coffin. Then the lid is forced
tdown, huge locks closed over it.

tLouis, in the smallest imaginable space. Beating his

</b>
tIs thrust into a niche in the wall. Bricks being placed
tover, mortar trowelled on.

</b>
tLouis upside down. Sounds of bricks and mortar. Then
tterrifying, unearthly scream pierces the coffin,
tstriking to his very soul.

tHe loses consciousness.


<b>tBLACKNESS
</b>

tLouis opens his eyes. The lid opens. He sees -

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttAbove him, reaching down to take
tthis hand.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttHurry. Don't make a sound.

tLouis gets out, into a vast long catacomb. Louis runs
tto the end of it, steps through a broken brick wall.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhere is she? Where's Claudia?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttFollow me - that way - through my

tHe points to his cell at the end of the passage, the

</b>ttNot without Claudia. Where is she?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttI can't save her.

</b>ttYou can't believe I'd leave without

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttLouis, I can't save her. I will

tLouis runs up the stone stairs. It leads to the
tballroom. He enters.

tEstelle stands far off, looking at him coolly. She
tlifts the stage skull mask and laughs softly behind it.
tA male vampire slumps in a chair staring softly at
tLouis.

tSilence. Indifference.

tLouis sees Lestat sitting in a far corner. he rushes up
tto Lestat, who looks up at him, confused. He's holding
tsomething crumpled, made of cloth.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou'll come home with me Louis? For

<b>ttttLOUIS

tLouis turns round and round in rage. Passive still
tfaces. A door bangs open and shut.

tLouis looks again at Lestat. He snatches the cloth from
tLestat's hand. We see it is a small torn bloodstained
tdress. Claudia's dress.

tThe door bangs again. Estelle laughs. Rain gusts into
tthe ballroom.

tLouis goes to the door, holding the dress. Armand
tapproaches, trying to pull him away, but Louis shrugs
thim off. He draws nearer and nearer and stairs at -


<b>tINT. BRICK AIRWELL
</b>
tOn the stones lie Claudia and Madeleine, burn to ashes,
tin each other's arms, like the corpses of his wife and

tOnly Claudia's blond hair and Madeleine's red hair
tremain unburnt.

tLouis looks up at the walls of this airwell, many
tstories to the sky. He cries out in agony.

tSantiago appears behind him, staring. Louis roars in
thorror and attacks Santiago, scattering the ashes into
tthe rainy wind. Claudia's golden locks fly up into the
twind, they whirl around the warring figure.

tArmand appears, drags Louis free, pulls him screaming
tfrom the airwell, into the ballroom, towards the exit.

tThen he strikes a match and heaves it into the

tkerosene roars into fire through the ballroom over the
tcoffins and up the stairs. We hear EXPLOSIONS of fire
tfrom above.

tShudders all over, fighting the morning weakness. He

tSCREAMS come from everywhere.

tAnother vampire rushes burning towards Louis. He
tdecapitates him in turn. Then he staggers into Armand's

tLouis staggers out of the burning theatre, into the
tthin daylight. Great gusts of smoke cover the street.
tHe staggers through the daylight, weakening, about to
tfall, when through the clouds of smoke comes -


<b>tA MAGNIFICENT HEARSE
</b>
tAs in a dream, driven by Armand's human boy. The door
tof the hearse opens. Through the curtains enclosing the
tinterior, we see Armand. He reaches a hand out to Louis
tand pulls him inside.

tThe hearse vanishes through the smoke, leaving the
tspectacle of the burning theatre.


<b>tEXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - TWILIGHT
</b>
tThe gutted Theatre and ballroom, the roof collapsed,
texposed to the evening sky. The life of Paris goes on
taround it, oblivious.


<b>tINT. LOUVRE - NIGHTS LATER
</b>
tIt is already a museum by this time and Louis and
tArmand, fancily dressed and composed, walk through it.
tThey stop by a Gericault - The Wreck of the Medusa.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou didn't even warm them, did you?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttAnd yet you knew what I would do.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttI knew. I rescued you, didn't I?
ttFrom the terrible dawn.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou were their leader. They trusted
ttyou.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttYou made me see their failings,
ttLouis. You made me look at them
ttwith your eyes.

tHe looks at Louis affectionately.

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttYour melancholy eyes...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttWhat a pair we are. We deserve each
ttother, don't we?

<b>ttttARMAND
</b>ttWe are a pair, and that's what
ttcounts.

tArmand and Louis walk slowly through the Louvre
ttogether. Camera follows them for a while, then comes
tto rest on a sunrise by Turner.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttWe left Paris shortly after. For
ttyears we wandered. Greece, Egypt,
ttall the ancient lands. Then, out of
ttcuriosity, perhaps, boredom, who
ttknows what, I took him home, to my
ttAmerica...


<b>tINT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
</b>
tA deco cinema of the twenties. Louis and Armand,
tdressed in the style of the period walk down the aisle
tthrough the crowded seats.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttAnd there, a technological wonder
ttallowed me see sunrise, for the
ttfirst time in two hundred years...

tOn the screen, Murnau's "Sunrise", in black and white.
tWe see a montage of sunrises, from a whole range of
tmovies, in black and white.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttAnd what sunrises! Seen as the
tthuman eye could never see them. We
ttwould sit in the dark, night after
ttnight among nameless humans,
ttentranced with the miracle of
ttlight. Silver at first, then as the
ttyears progressed in tones of
ttpurple, red and my long-lost
ttblue...

tThe SUNRISES continue, in color now, and the
tbackgrounds in them change to the fifties.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttAnd in time parted. We had become
ttso alike, we both wanted the
ttcertainties of loneliness once
ttmore.

tThe lights come up in a different theatre. Louis
tsitting there, alone, in a half empty theatre, dressed
tin the clothes of the fifties. He rises, exits with the
tothers.


<b>tEXT. NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tCars rushing by, twentieth-century madness. Louis
temerges from the theatre, walks through the streets.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttI had returned to new Orleans. As
ttsoon as I smelt the air, I knew I
ttwas home. There was sadness there,
ttrich, almost sweet, like the
ttfragrance of jasmine. I walked the
ttstreets, savoring it like a long
ttlost perfume...


<b>tEXT. GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT
</b>
tLouis walks past the many Greek Revival Mansions.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttAnd then on Prytania Street, only
ttblocks from the Lafayette cemetery
ttI caught the scent of death and it
ttwasn't coming from the graves...

tCAMERA PANS OVER white-walled Lafayette cemetery and
tits surrounding mansions.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttThe scent grew stronger as I
ttwalked. Old death. A scent too
ttfaint for mortals to detect.

tLouis sees rats darting across the street. They rush
tinto a great overgrown garden surrounding a ruined
tmansion. No lights.

tLouis stops at a rusted gate. He forces it open and
tenters -


<b>tA VERITABLE JUNGLE
</b>
tOf overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria. he sees a
tfaint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass
twindow of a huge Greek Revival house. He approaches
tthen he sees -


<b>tOLD SHRIVELLED CORPSE
</b>
tOf a man, long dead and dried up, snagged in the thorny
trosevines.


<b>tLOUIS
</b>
tLooks around. Walks on. Sees another corpse, almost
tnothing but bones, sinking into the wet earth, the
troots of an oak overgrowing it.

tHe looks up at the distant light.

tHe passes a third corpse, caught in wisteria and rose
tvine, only bones and clothes.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttThey were like the doomed princess
ttcaught in the thorny vines of
ttSleeping Beauty's castle. I knew
ttwhat it meant. A vampire had lured
ttthem here, but had been to weak to
ttget rid of them.

tLouis sees dead rats lying near the steps.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttIt spelt weakness, madness, the
ttbehavior of a dying animal that
ttpollutes its own lair.

tLouis treads carefully on the rotted steps. he moves
talong the porch. More dead rats. He sees through the
tfloor-length window into rooms lined with stacked
tbooks. Virtually walled with them. Water seeps down
tfrom the ceiling, gleaming as it streaks over the
tbooks. The floors of the splendid rooms are bare,
texcept for a rotten French chair by a dead fireplace. A
tsingle mirror reflecting the moon.

tDead rats.

tHe moves along the porch to the parlor windows. The
tcandle flickers inside. He sees -


<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tLestat lying on the floor. He is gaunt to near
tstarvation. All his scars are gone, but he is almost a
tskeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets.
tHis clothes are rags. Blond hair beautiful, as always.


<b>tMALLOY'S ENTRANCES FACE SUPERIMPOSED OVER
</b>
<b>ttttMALLOY (V.O.)
</b>ttLestat escaped the fire!

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttHe hadn't even been there. And all
ttthose years I thought he was dead.


<b>tBACK TO LESTAT
</b>
tOne tiny candle stands beside him. He reads an early
tcomic, from the turn of the century. Without turning
this head, he speaks.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttI'm so glad you're here Louis...
ttI've dreamed of your coming...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDon't try to speak... it's
ttalright...

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttI didn't mean to let them do it...
ttthat Santiago, he tricked me...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThat's all past, Lestat.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYes. Past... she should never have
ttbeen one of us...

tHe turns and looks at Louis. Old, fearful, broken.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttStill beautiful Louis. You always
ttwere the strong one.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDon't fear me, Lestat. I bring you
ttno harm.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou've come back to me, Louis?
ttYou've come again to me?

tLouis shakes his head. A series of police sirens go by,
tpiercing the night sky. A helicopter goes overhead. Red
tflashes illuminate his face. Lestat shivers, covers his
tears. He's terrified. Louis touches him, calming him,
tuntil the lights pass over.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttIt's only a siren...

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttI can't bear it Louis! The machines
ttout there, that fly and that roar!
ttAnd such lights! They make the
ttnight brighter than the day!

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttAnd they frighten you?

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou know I love the dark. But
ttthere's no dark anymore.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttIt's false light, Lestat. It can't
ttharm you...

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttIf you stayed with me Louis, I
ttcould venture out... little by
ttlittle... become the old Lestat.

tLouis shivers. He releases him.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI have to go now Lestat...

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou remember how I was, Louis.. the
ttvampire Lestat...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYes. I remember...

tLestat shivers.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttI tried to tell you Louis... that
ttnight in Paris... when I first came
ttto you... no-one can refuse the
ttdark gift, Louis... not even you.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttI tried...

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttAnd the more you tried, the more I
ttwanted you... a vampire with your
ttbeautiful, suffering human heart.
ttAnd how you suffered... I need your
ttforgiveness, Louis.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou have it...

tLouis walks slowly away from him. Lestat turns back to
this candle, his magazine.

<b>ttttLESTAT
</b>ttYou'll come back, Louis... take me
ttout... little by little... and
ttmaybe I'll be myself again...

tA bluebottle buzzes by him. His hand shoots out and
tgrabs it, squeezes the blood.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttYes, Lestat...


<b>tON LOUIS
</b>
tAs he walks through the decayed house. His eyes are
texpressionless.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttAnd my story ends there. But in
ttfact it ended a long time ago, with
ttClaudia's ashes in that theatre. My
ttlove died with her. I never really
ttchanged after that. What became of
ttLestat I have no idea. I go on,
ttnight after night. I feed on those
ttwho cross my path. But all my
ttpassion went with her yellow hair.
ttI ma a spirit with preternatural
ttflesh. Detached. unchangeable.
ttEmpty.


<b>tINT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT (PRESENT)
</b>
tMalloy, staring at Louis.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttNo... it can't end like that...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttBut it has. There is no more to
tttell.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttBut you talk about passion, about
ttlonging, about things I'll never
ttknow in my life! It's still inside
ttyou, in every syllable you speak!
ttAnd then you tell me it ends like
ttthat? Just empty?

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttIt's over, I'm telling you...

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttYou need a new passion, Louis, a
ttnew reason to feel... what a story
ttyou've told, you don't understand
ttyourself.

tLouis looks at the cassettes on the table.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDo what you want with it. Learn
ttwhat you can. Give the story to
ttothers.

tMalloy rises.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttYou have another chance, Louis.
ttTake me! Give me your gift, your
ttpower...

tLouis is slowly horrified, then outraged and angry.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttIs this what you want? You ask me
ttfor this after all I've told you?

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttIf I could see what you've seen,
ttfeel what you've felt I wouldn't
ttlet it end like this! You need a
ttlike to the world out there, a
ttconnection... then it won't end
ttlike this...

tHe stares at Louis.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttYou need me.

tLouis turns away.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDear God. I've failed again,
tthaven't I?

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttNo...

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttDon't say anymore. The reels are
ttstill turning. I have but one
ttchance to show you the meaning of
ttwhat I've said.

tHe looks at the boy. Then suddenly grabs him, lifts him
toff the floor, bares his terrifying fangs and brings
tthem to his throat. Malloy screams, in involuntary
tterror.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttYou like it? You like being food
ttfor the immortals? You like dying?
ttIs it beautiful? Is it intense?

tMalloy, now terrified, whispers

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttNo... please...

tLouis drops him.

<b>ttttLOUIS
</b>ttThank God.

tMalloy, falls on the floor, terrified. When he looks
tup, Louis has vanished.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttLouis... Louis...

tHe looks up at the tape. It is still turning.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttHoly shit...

tHe shakes his head. He gets up, and with shaking
tfingers gathers his tapes. He runs out of the room.


<b>tEXT. STREET OUTSIDE - NIGHT
</b>
tMalloy running for his car, a convertible. He leaps in
tand screeches off through the night.


<b>tEXT. STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
tMalloy whips the car through the tiny streets, in
tsheer, unfocused terror.

<b>ttttMALLOY
</b>ttJesus...


<b>tEXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT
</b>
tMalloy driving with streams of traffic over the bridge.
tHe breathes deeply, to calm himself. He takes a tape
tfrom his pocket, and with still shaking hands, sticks
tit in the deck.

<b>ttttLOUIS (V.O.)
</b>ttt(tape)
tt1791. That's when it happened. I
ttwas twenty-four. Younger then you
ttare now.

tSuddenly a bony hand shoots out from the back seat,
tpulls his neck backwards -


<b>tLESTAT
</b>
tSinks his teeth in his neck.


<b>tMALLOY'S HANDS
</b>
tOn the wheel, shaking, shuddering, losing their grip.


<b>tMALLOY'S EYES
</b>
tBulging, as the life drains out of him. Lestat sucking
thim like a rat.


<b>tTHE WHEEL
</b>
tSwinging free of Malloy's dying hands.


<b>tTHE CAR
</b>
tVeers wildly into oncoming traffic.

</b>
tDrinks regardless.


<b>tA TRUCK
</b>
tComing towards them, about to crush the car.


<b>tLESTAT'S BONY HAND
</b>
tGrabs the wheel, jerks it as he drinks.


<b>tTHE CAR
</b>
tMisses the truck by inches.

</b>
tThrows Malloy to one side, climbs into the front seat.

tThe tape is playing.

tAt the wheel, the corpse of Malloy in the passenger
