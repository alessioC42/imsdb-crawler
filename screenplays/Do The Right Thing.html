"The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America
is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown
violent.  It is a miracle that 22 million black people have
not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would
have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the
democratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation of
black people has so fervently continued to believe in a
turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die
philosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black people
have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the
centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's
heaven!  The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro
'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with
degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off
their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black
masses quiet until now."

<b>CAMERA MOVES BACK SLOWLY TO REVEAL MISTER SExd1OR LOVE DADDY,
</b>a DJ, a radio personality, behind a microphone.


<b>tttttMISTER SExd1OR LOVE DADDY
</b>tt  This is Mister Sexf1or Love Daddy.

tt  only twelve-hour strongman, here on
tt  WE LOVE radio, 108 FM.  The last on
tt  your dial, but the first in ya
tt  hearts, and that's the truth, Ruth!

The CAMERA, which is STILL PULLING BACK, shows that Mister
Sexf1or Love Daddy is actually sitting in a storefront window.
The control booth looks directly out onto the street.  This
is WE LOVE RADIO, a modest station with a loyal following,
right in the heart of the neighborhood.  The OPENING SHOT
will be a TRICK SHOT--the CAMERA PULLING BACK through the
storefront window.

<b>tttttMISTER SExd1OR LOVE DADDY

<b>INT: DA MAYOR'S BEDROOM--DAY
</b>
An old, grizzled man stirs in the bed, his sheets are soaked
with sweat.  He flings them off his wet body.

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  Damn, it's hot.

<b>INT: JADE'S APARTMENT--DAY
</b>
CAMERA MOVES IN ON a young man sitting at the edge of a sofa
bed.

<b>CLOSE UP--HIS SMALL HANDS
</b>
WE SEE him counting his money.  This isn't any ordinary
counting of money, he's straightening out all the corners of
the bills, arranging them so the bills--actually the "dead
presidents"--are facing the same way.  This is MOOKIE.  Once
he's finished with that task, counting his money, he sneaks
into his sister's bedroom.

<b>INT: JADE'S BEDROOM--DAY
</b>
<b>CLOSE UP--JADE
</b>
JADE, Mookie's sister, is fast asleep.  Mookie's fingers
ENTER THE FRAME and start to play with her lips.  Jade
pushes his hands away.  Mookie waits several beats and he
continues.  Jade wakes up--mad.

<b>tttttJADE
</b>tt  Don't you have enough sense not to
tt  bother people when they're sleeping?

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  Wake up!

He plants a big fat juicy on his sister's forehead.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
A 1975 El Dorado pulls up in front of the neighborhood
pizzeria--Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

From out of the car comes the owner, SAL, a slightly
overweight man in his early fifties, and his two sons, PINO,
22, and VITO, 20.  It's time for them to go to work at Sal's
Famous Pizzeria in the heart of Black Brooklyn.  Sal's sits
on the corner of The Block.  The Block being where this film
on the hottest day of the summer takes place.

Pino kicks a beer can in his path into the gutter.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Pino, get a broom and sweep out
tt  front.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  Vito, get a broom and sweep out
tt  front.

<b>tttttVITO
</b>tt  See, Pop.  That's just what I was
tt  talkin' about.  Every single time
tt  you tell Pino to do something, he
tt  gives it to me.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  He's nuts.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  The both of youse, shaddup.

<b>tttttVITO

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Hey!  Watch it.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  I didn't want to come to work
tt  anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Can you do better?  C'mere.

Pino is now silent.  Sal walks over to him.


<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Can you do better?
ttt    (he pops Pino upside
ttt    the head)
tt  I didn't think so.  This is a
tt  respectable business.  Nuthin'
tt  wrong with it.  Get dat broom.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  Tell Vito.

<b>tttttVITO
</b>tt  Pop asked you.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  I'm gonna kill somebody today.

<b>EXT: MOOKIE'S BROWNSTONE--DAY
</b>
Mookie comes down his stoop and walks to work.

<b>EXT: STREET--DAY
</b>
The Block is beginning to come to life.  Those unlucky souls
who have to work this Saturday drag themselves to it, and
the kids are out on the street to play in the hot sun all
day long.

<b>EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY
</b>
Mookie stops to say hello to MOTHER SISTER.  She leans out
her window on the parlor floor.  In the summertime, the only
time when she's not perched in her window is when she's
asleep.

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  Good morning, Mookie.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  Good morning to you.

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  Now, Mookie, don't work too hard
tt  today.  The man said it's gonna be
tt  HOT as the devil.  I don't want ya

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  I hear ya, Mother Sister.  I hear
tt  you.


<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  Good.  I'll be watching ya, son.
tt  Mother Sister always watches.

<b>INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
Mookie enters the pizzeria and Pino is on him before the
door closes.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  Mookie, late again.  How many times
tt  I gotta tell you?

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.

<b>tttttSAL

</b>tt  You're still late.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Pino, relax, will ya.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  Here, take the broom.  The front
tt  needs sweeping.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I
tt  just got here.  You sweep.  I
tt  betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.

<b>tttttVITO
</b>tt  That's right.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  Shaddup, Vito.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas.
tt  That's what I get paid for.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  You get paid to do what we say.


<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  What we say.  I didn't hear Sal say
tt  nuthin'.

Pino looks at his father.  He wants to be backed up on this;
all he gets is an amused look, and a smirk from Vito.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  Who's working for who?

There's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Come on in, Mayor.

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  Good morning, gentlemens.  It's
tt  gonna be a scorcher today, that's
tt  for sure.  Need any work done
tt  around here?

Sal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom.

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  It will be the cleanest sidewalk in
tt  Brooklyn.  Clean as the Board of
tt  Health.

Da Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon
as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We
tt  runnin' welfare or somethin'?
tt  Every day you give dat bum--

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  Da Mayor ain't no bum.

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping
tt  our sidewalk.  What do we pay
tt  Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I
tt  work harder than him and I'm your
tt  own son.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  Who don't work?  Let's see you
tt  carry six large pies up six flights
tt  of stairs.  No elevator either and
tt  shit.

tt  place of business.

<b>tttttPINO

<b>tttttVITO
</b>tt  Sez who?

<b>tttttPINO
</b>tt  Sez me.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Hey!  What did I say?

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  Who doesn't work?  Don't start no
tt  shit, won't be no shit.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Mookie, no cursing in the store.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  Talk to your son.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor sweeps the sidewalk, happy as can be.  As soon as
he finishes he can get that money and get that bottle.

<b>EXT: STOOP--DAY
</b>
A group of youths sit on a stoop, waiting for someone.  They
are CEE, PUNCHY, and the lone female, ELLA.

<b>tttttELLA
</b>tt  What's keeping him?

<b>tttttPUNCHY
</b>tt  You call him, then.

Ella stands up and yells.

<b>tttttELLA
</b>tt  Yo, Ahmad!

<b>tttttPUNCHY
</b>tt  I coulda done dat.


<b>tttttELLA
</b>tt  Yo, Ahmad!

She looks up into his window, then sits down.

<b>tttttELLA
</b>tt  Punchy, if ya want to do some more
tt  screaming, be my guest.  I'm too
tt  through.

The door swings open at the top of the stoop and AHMAD
appears.

<b>tttttAHMAD
</b>tt  Who's yelling my name?

<b>tttttELLA
</b>tt  Punchy told me to.

<b>tttttAHMAD
</b>tt  Don't listen to him, it will get ya
tt  in trouble.

<b>tttttELLA
</b>tt  Heard that, Punchy.

Ahmad sits down with them.

<b>tttttAHMAD
</b>tt  Ella, you have a brain, use it.

In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box.  The
sound gets louder as the box gets closer.  The youths look
down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them.
He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop.  This is
RADIO RAHEEM.  The size of his box is tremendous and one has
to think, how does he carry something that big around with
him?  It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk
shakes as the rap music blares out.  The song we hear is the
only one Radio Raheem plays.

<b>MEDIUM SHOT--RADIO RAHEEM
</b>
Radio Raheem stops in front of the group, looks at them, and
turns down the volume.  It's quiet again.

<b>tttttRADIO RAHEEM
</b>tt  Peace, y'all.

<b>tttttELLA
</b>tt  Peace, Radio Raheem.

<b>tttttCEE
</b>tt  Peace.

<b>ttttttttttt    10.
</b>

<b>tttttPUNCHY
</b>tt  You the man, Radio Raheem.

<b>tttttAHMAD
</b>tt  It's your world.

<b>tttttCEE
</b>tt  In a big way.

Radio Raheem nods and turns up the volume.  Way up.

<b>tttttAHMAD
</b>tt  My people.  My people.

<b>EXT: WE LOVE STOREFRONT--DAY
</b>
Radio Raheem waves to Mister Sexf1or Love Daddy as he walks by.

<b>INT: WE LOVE CONTROL BOOTH--DAY
</b>
Mister Sexf1or Love Daddy gives Radio Raheem a clenched-fist
salute.

<b>EXT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor walks into a newly opened fruit and vegetable deli
stand that is owned by Koreans.

<b>INT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor is looking for his beer in the refrigerated cases,
his ice-cold beer.

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  Where's the Bud?  Where's the Bud?

<b>tttttKOREAN CLERK
</b>tt  No mo' Bud.  You look what we have
tt  and buy.

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  No more Bud.  What kind of joint is
tt  this?  How come no mo' Bud?  Doctor,
tt  this ain't Korea, China, or wherever
tt  you come from.  Get some Budweiser
tt  in this motherfucker.

<b>tttttKOREAN CLERK
</b>tt  You buy 'nother beer.

<b>ttttttttttt    11.
</b>

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  Alright.  Alright.  Y'know you're
tt  asking a lot to make a man change
tt  his beer, that's asking a lot,
tt  Doctor.

<b>EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor has his can of beer (not Budweiser) and the brown
paper bag is twisted into a knot at the bottom.  He stops
and takes a long swig.

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  You ole drunk.  What did I tell ya
tt  about drinking in front of my stoop?
tt  Move on, you're blocking my view.

Da Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his
heckler.  It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard
this before.  Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her.

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  You ugly enough.  Don't stare at me.

Da Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look.

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  The evil eye doesn't work on me.

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  Mother Sister, you've been talkin'
tt  'bout me the last eighteen years.
tt  What have I ever done to you?

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  You're a drunk fool.

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  Besides that.  Da Mayor don't
tt  bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother
tt  Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just
tt  mind his business.  I love everybody.
tt  I even love you.

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  Hold your tongue.  You don't have
tt  that much love.

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  One day you'll be nice to me.  We
tt  might both be dead and buried, but
tt  you'll be nice.  At least civil.

<b>ttttttttttt    12.
</b>

Da Mayor tips his beat-up hat to Mother Sister and takes a
final swig of beer just for her.

<b>INT: TINA'S APARTMENT--DAY
</b>
An elderly Puerto Rican woman, CARMEN, is telling off her
daughter TINA in Spanish.  Tina, having heard enough, closes
the door on her mother's ranting and raving.

<b>ANGLE--TINA
</b>
Tina bends down and scoops her baby son HECTOR up from the
bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts.  She talks
to her son while walking around the room.

<b>tttttTINA
</b>tt  Hector, I shouldn't be telling you
tt  this but you would find out sooner
tt  or later.  Ya father ain't no real
tt  father.  He's a bum, a two-bit bum
tt  in a hundred-dollar world.  Your
tt  father is to the curb.  You're
tt  smart.  I see that look on ya face.
tt  You're saying if he's such a bum
tt  why am I with him?  Good question.
tt  Like I said before, you're no dummy.
tt  He talked his way into my panties,
tt  I thought being a mother would make
tt  me happy, make me whole.  He's a
tt  mistake, but you are not.

Tina kisses her son.  Tina is seventeen years old, another
teenage parent.

<b>EXT: STREET CORNER--DAY
</b>
Every day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall,
a small group of men meet.  They have no steady employment,
nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift
of gab.  These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a
bottle is going round and they're feeling "nice," they get
philosophical.  These men become the great thinkers of the
world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the
homeless, and AIDS.  They're called the Corner Men: SWEET
DICK WILLIE, COCONUT SID, and ML.  All three are sitting in
folding chairs up against a wall in the shade.

<b>tttttML
</b>tt  The way I see it, if this hot
tt  weather continues, it will surely
tt  melt the polar caps and the whole

<b>INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Customers are in Sal's; it's lunchtime and it's fairly busy.
Sal puts a hot slice down on the counter in front of BUGGIN'
OUT, a b-boy.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  You paying now or on layaway?

Buggin' Out looks at the slice.

Buggin' Out slams his money down on the counter, takes his
slice and sits down.

<b>ANGLE--TABLE
</b>
All around Buggin' Out, peering down from the WALL OF FAME,
are signed, framed, eight by ten glossies of famous Italian
Americans.  WE SEE Joe DiMaggio, Rocky Marciano, Perry Como,
Frank Sinatra, Luciano Pavarotti, Liza Minnelli, Governor
Mario Cuomo, Al Pacino and, of course, how can we forget
Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa: THE ITALIAN STALLION,
also RAMBO.

A wife tells her husband, "Hell no, I'm not cooking.  It's

<b>HOT CITY NIGHT MONTAGE
</b>
THE BLOCK.  WE'VE SEEN it at daytime, but now WE SEE it at
night.  Even though the white-hot sun is gone, nonetheless
the heat is still stifling.  And in a peculiar, funny sort
of way, it's worse.  You expect it to be hot during the
light of day when the sun is beating down on the cement and
tar, but at night it should be considerably cooler; well,
not tonight, it's hot.  All the residents of The Block: the
Corner Men, Mother Sister, Da Mayor, Jade, etc., all the
people WE'VE SEEN throughout the day are now coping with the
night-time heat, plus it's humid as shit.  Everyone is
outside, sitting on stoops, on cars and you know the kids
are playing, running up and down the block.  Now it's the
hottest night of the year.

All three look at each other.  The horror is on their faces,
with the prospect of working, slaving in Sal's and Sons

OH NO!  We hear the dum-dum-dum of Radio Raheem's box.  As
everyone turns their heads to the door, Buggin' Out and
Radio Raheem are inside already.  We have never heard the
rap music as loud as it is now.  You have to scream to be
heard and that's what they do.

Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella start to dance while Mookie
takes a seat, the impartial observer that he is.

<b>tttttBUGGIN' OUT
</b>tt  Why it gotta be about jungle music
tt  and Africa?

<b>tttttBUGGIN' OUT
</b>tt  You're closed alright, till you get

Sal grabs his Mickey Mantle bat from underneath the counter
and brings it down on Radio Raheem's box, again and again
and again.  The music stops.

<b>CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX
</b>
Radio Raheem's pride and joy is smashed to smithereens.
It's going to the junkyard quick.

<b>ANGLE--PIZZERIA
</b>
There is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen, surprised by
the suddenness of Sal's action, the swings of his Mickey
Mantle bat.  All look at Radio Raheem and realize what is
about to happen.

<b>ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM
</b>
Radio Raheem screams, he goes crazy.

<b>tttttRADIO RAHEEM
</b>tt  My music!

Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts
to choke his ass.  Radio Raheem's prized possession--his
box, the only thing he owned of value--his box, the one
thing that gave him any sense of worth--has been smashed to
bits. (Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of
materialism and a misplaced sense of values.) Now he doesn't
give a fuck anymore.  He's gonna make Sal pay with his life.

Vito and Pino jump on Radio Raheem, who only tightens his
grip around Sal's neck.  Buggin' Out tries to help his
friend.  Mookie just stands and watches as Ahmad, Cee,
Punchy, and Ella cheerlead.

The cop cars come right through the crowd, almost running
over some people.  The cops get out with nightsticks and
guns drawn.  WE RECOGNIZE two of the faces, Officers Long
and Ponte.  Any time there is a skirmish between a Black man
and a white man, you can bet the house on who the copes are
gonna go for.  You know the deal!  Buggin' Out is pulled off
first, then Vito and Pino, but Radio Raheem is a crazed man.
It takes all six cops to pull him off Sal, who is red as a
beet from being choked.

Handcuffs are put on Buggin' Out as he watches the other

The officers pick up Radio Raheem's limp body and throw him

The wail of fire trucks and police sirens is now added to
the night.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT
</b>
The mob moves back to in front of Sal's as the fire trucks
and police, in full riot gear, pull up in the street behind
them.

<b>tttttPOLICE LOUDSPEAKER (VO)
</b>tt  Good people.  Please disperse.
tt  Please disperse.

The firemen rush to hook up their hoses, the police force
themselves between the crowd and the burning Sal's Famous
Pizzeria.

<b>tttttPOLICE LOUDSPEAKER (VO)
</b>tt  Please disperse!  Please disperse!

The mob doesn't listen, they will not be moved.  The mob
will not be moved until they see Sal's Famous Pizzeria burn
to the ground.

<b>ANGLE--SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA
</b>
The firemen douse the pizzeria, trying desperately to stop
the fire from spreading into the adjoining buildings.

The hoses are turned on the mob.

</b>

WE SEE Mookie, Mother Sister, Sweet Dick Willie, ML, Coconut
Sid, Jade, Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella, etc., go down
before the powerful blast of the firehouse.

Now we've come full circle.  We're back to Montgomery or
Birmingham, Alabama.  The only thing missing is Sheriff Bull
Connor and the German shepherds.

It would take force to move them and that's exactly what the
mob got.  People are trying to hold on to each other, cars,
railings, anything to keep from being swept away.

<b>EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT
</b>
Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino watch in disbelief.  It's
unbelievable what is happening before their eyes.

</b><b>THEIR POV
</b>
People are screaming, kids and women are not being spared
from the brute force of the firehoses either.

WE SEE the reflection of the fire in the storefront window
as Mister Sexf1or Love Daddy looks on.

</b>
<b>ANGLE--JADE AND MOTHER SISTER
</b>
Jade and Mother Sister try to hold on to a streetlamp as a
gush of water hits them; their grips loosens, the water is
too powerful, and they slide away down the block and Da
Mayor runs after them.

As WE MOVE IN TIGHTER ON the melted box, we begin to hear
the rap song that we've hear throughout.  All other sound
drops as the rap song gets louder and louder until it's
deafening.

<b>ANGLE--SMILEY
</b>
Smiley sits up from where he hid during the burning and
looting of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.  Smiley looks around and
goes directly to the smoldering Wall of Fame.  He stands
there.  Smiley pins one of his Malcolm X/Martin Luther King,
Jr., cards to the Wall of Fame.

We're on Smiley's face and a smile slowly travels across.
It's the first time Smiley has smiled in years and nobody is

The CAMERA, FROM HIGH ABOVE, CRANES DOWN ON The Block.  The
sidewalk is deserted, broken glass is everywhere, and it
looks exactly as how one expects it to look, the morning
after an uprising.

The CAMERA NOW MOVES IN ON the WE LOVE storefront where
Mister Sexf1or Love Daddy is in his familiar place behind the
mike.

Mookie leaves.

<b>MOTHER SISTER'S BEDROOM--DAY
</b>
Da Mayor wakes up in Mother Sister's big brass bed (she was
born in it).  At first he has no idea where he's at, then
sees Mother Sister sitting down across the room smiling at
him.

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  Good morning.

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  Is it a good morning?

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself

Da Mayor gets up out of her big brass bed.

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  I didn't.

<b>tttttDA MAYOR
</b>tt  I hope the block is still standing.

<b>tttttMOTHER SISTER
</b>tt  We're still standing.

Da Mayor and Mother Sister both look out the parlor window
to see THE BLOCK and Mookie.

<b>EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY
</b>
Mookie walks up to Sal's Famous Pizzeria as it still
smoulders in the morning light.  Sal emerges from the
wreckage; he looks like he might have slept there.

<b>ttttttttttt    90.
</b>

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Whatdafuck do you want?

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  I wants my money.  I wants to get
tt  paid.

Sal looks at Mookie in disbelief.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Mookie, I always liked you.  Not
tt  the smartest kid, but you're honest.
tt  Don't make me dislike you.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  Sal, I want my money.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Don't even ask about your money.
tt  Your money wouldn't even pay for
tt  that window you smashed.

tt  Mook, this isn't the time.

Sal has had it.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  How much?  How much do I owe you?

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  My salary.  Two-fifty.

Sal pulls out a wad and quickly peels off hundred dollar
bills.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  One, two, three, four, five.

Sal throws the "C" notes at Mookie, they hit him in the
chest and fall to the sidewalk.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Are you happy now?  That's five
tt  fucking hundred dollars.  You just
tt  got paid.  Mookie, you are a rich
tt  man, now ya life is set, you'll
tt  never have another worry, a care in
tt  the world.  Mookie, ya wealthy, a
tt  fuckin' Rockefeller.

Mookie is stunned by Sal's outburst.  He picks up the bills.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Ya just got paid, so leave me the
tt  fuck alone.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  You only pay me two-fifty a week.
ttt    (he throws two "C"
ttt    notes back at him)
tt  I owe you fifty bucks.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Keep it.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  You keep it.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Christmas came early.

Both look at the two hundred-dollar bills on the sidewalk
and refuse to pick them up.  It's a stalemate.

<b>ttttttttttt    92.
</b>

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  This is the hottest Christmas I've
tt  known.

Mookie counts his money.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  It's supposed to be even hotter
tt  today.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  You gonna open up another Sal's
tt  Famous Pizzeria?

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Mookie?

<b>tttttMOOKIE

Mookie turns around and goes back.

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b><b>tt  OK.  OK.

<b>tttttSAL

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  That's it?

<b>ttttttttttt    93.
</b>

<b>tttttSAL
</b>tt  That's it.

Mookie thinks about it, looks at the two "C" notes still
smiling up at him.  He quickly scoops them up.

<b>tttttMOOKIE
</b>tt  I got it.

<b>EXT: STREET--DAY
</b>
<b>HIGH ANGLE
</b>
As Mookie turns and walks away, Sal goes back into Sal's
Famous Pizzeria to salvage what is salvageable, and The
Block begins to awake from its slumber, ready to deal once
again with the heat of the hottest day of the year.
