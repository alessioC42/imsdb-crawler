<b>tEXT. ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. - 4:00 AM
</b>
tA patch of water. PULL BACK TO REVEAL more water.  BACK
tFARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to
tmassive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River
tmanor house; the country estate of William Parrish.

<b>tINT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 4:00 AM
</b>
tMOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into
tan expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with
tBierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists
tand trees and small boats and distant humans.

<b>tINT. PARRISH BEDROOM - 4:00 AM
</b>
tMOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish-
ted with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping
toccupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a
tman of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.

tAlthough asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him.
tParrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity
tof the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes
tup, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the
twind itself:

<b>ttt     VOICE (V.O.)
</b>tt... Yes.

tParrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is
tnot sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades,
tthe discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided.

tHe rises now, crosses to the bathroom.  As he pees, a breeze
toutside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes
tup:

<b>ttt     VOICE (V.O.)
</b>ttYes...

tIt is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has
theard something, he looks around, but no one is there.  He
tcan't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom.  All beweild-
tered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed,
ttrying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't
theard; he is not sure.

tHe pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his
teyes.

<b>ttt     VOICE (V.O.)
</b>ttYes.

tParrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one
tthere, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up,
tshould he not, what is happening?  He looks out: absolute
tstillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a
tlight FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but
tthen they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and
tfinally, exhausted, falls back asleep.

<b>tEXT. REAR TERRACE, PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - NEXT MORNING
</b>
tThe great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un-
trolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and
tadding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms,
tspeakers, lights.  Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's
tolder daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she
trelishing every moment.

tA Painter approaches.

<b>ttt     PAINTER
</b>ttThe big tent, Miss Allison --

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttPaint is rust and moss green.
ttMedieval colors -- Daddy's like
ttan old knight.

tA Florist stops her.

<b>ttt     FLORIST
</b>ttThe head table --?

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttWhat about it?

<b>ttt     FLORIST
</b>ttThe flowers, ma'am--?

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttFreesia, freesia, everywhere.  Daddy
ttloves freesia -- and you, over there,
ttlights.  Not too bright.  I'm looking
ttfor a saffron glow -- sort of tea-
ttdance twenties.

<b>tEXT. GREAT HALL, COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING
</b>
tParrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ-
ting the activity outside through the windows.  He checks his
twatch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family
tretainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish
tpasses.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWhat do you think of all this, May?

<b>ttt     MAY
</b>ttIt's going to be beautiful.  And
ttMiss Allison says the President may
ttcome.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttOh, the President's got better
ttthings to do than come to my
ttbirthday party.

<b>ttt     MAY
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttWhat?

tParrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who,
ton catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttDaddy!

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttHi, Allison --

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttHave you got a minute?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttNot much more.  Big day in the big
ttcity.  What's on your mind?

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttFireworks.  Update -- we're con-
ttstructing the number '65' on the
ttbarge, archers from the State
ttCollege at New Paltz will shoot
ttflaming arrows at it, when it
ttcatches fire it will give us the
tteffect of a Viking funeral with none
ttof the morbidity... The Hudson River
ttAuthority says, for you, they'll
ttmake a special dispensation - of
ttcourse there'll be an overtime bill
ttfor the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttAllison, I trust you.  This is your
ttthing.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttBut it's your birthday.

tParrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break-
tfast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is
tgrazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttGood morning, Dad.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttHi, honey.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttt(to Susan)
ttI'm Allison, you're 'honey'.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttDrew called from the AStar, they're
ttstill two minutes away.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttDrew's aboard?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttHe wanted to ride back down with
ttyou. Now sit and relax, get some-
ttthing in that flat tummy of yours --

tBut Parrish only pours coffee.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttt(to Allison)
ttYou coming?

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttYou've got patients waiting, I've
ttgot three hysterical chefs, one
ttloves truffles, the other hates
tttruffles, the third one doesn't know
ttwhat truffles are.  I'd better drive
ttdown.

tParrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing
tin intensity.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttt(unconsciously)
ttI hate parties --

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttCalm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're
ttgoing to love it.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttIsn't it enough to be on this earth
ttsixty-five years without having to
ttbe reminded of it.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttNo.

tAllison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWill you relax?  I know it is a big
ttdeal day --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttHow did you know?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttDrew told me.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttDoes Drew tell you everything?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI hope so.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYou like him, don't you?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYeah.  I guess so.

tA moment.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI don't like to interfere.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>tt...Then don't.

tThe helicopter CHOPS in overhead.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
tt-- Here comes our boy now --
ttShall we?

<b>tEXT. COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING
</b>
tA BUTLER and May carry the overnight bags for the family as
tled by Parrish, they hurry towards the helicopter.  En route
tthey pass QUINCE, 38, Allison's husband, who is perched at a
tportable bar with AMBROSE, the head caterer, tasting wines.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>tt...This shit's not bad.

<b>ttt     AMBROSE
</b>tt-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr.
ttQuince, a possibility for dessert.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttt(pointing to another
ttt bottle)
ttAnd that?

<b>ttt     AMBROSE
</b>ttPinot Grigio.  We're considering it
ttfor the appetizer.

tAmbrose takes a sip, swishes the wine in his mouth, spits it
tin a bucket.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttWhat do you do that for?

<b>ttt     AMBROSE
</b>ttWell sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>tt9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come
ttfrom, the sun's over the yardarm,
ttm'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.

tQuince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is
thailed by Allison.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttQuince!  Everybody's waiting!

tQuince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as
tDREW, 34, a young man going places, emerges from it,
tapproaches Parrish and Susan.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttt(to Susan)
ttHello, Beautiful.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttHi.

tDrew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttGood morning, Drew.  Thanks for
ttcoming out.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttWell, it's a big day.  Wanted to
ttline up a few ducks before kickoff.
ttAny thoughts?  Last minute refine-
ttments or variations?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>tt'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did
tthear a voice last night.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttA voice?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttIn my sleep.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttWhat'd it say?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>tt'Yes'.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>tt'Yes' to the deal?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttMaybe, who knows?  You know how
ttvoices are.  Let's go.

tQuince comes running up now.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttHi, Bill --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttGood morning, Quince.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttHow're you doing--?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI'm doing great.  You ready?

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttI am, this is it.  B Day.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttHow's that, Quince?

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttBontecou Day.  Going to close
ttwith Big John -- Look at you, Bill,
ttall cool as a cat and over at
ttBontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting
ttin his pants.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttt(to Quince)
ttHoney, please.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttOkay.  All aboard - New York, New
ttYork!

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttRemember everybody, tonight, dinner
ttin the city at Daddy's.  You too,
ttDrew.  We've still got some loose
ttends --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttNot my birthday again?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYou're only six-five once.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThank God.  Now could we go?  Let's
ttget this day started.

tDrew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and
tQuince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him
tAs Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors.

<b>tINT. ASTAR HELICOPTER - DAY
</b>
tThe configuration of seats has Drew beside Parrish, in front
tof them Quince and Susan opposite each other in single seats.
tJust as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache
tcase and spreads them out for Parrish on his tray table, the
tpilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'.  Drew gets up
tand heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances
tover at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own.
tHe motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks
tthat Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into
ther carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the
twork that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI thought you were in a meeting--?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI am.  With you.

tHe peers up ahead at Drew, on the telephone and gesticulat-
ting intensely, right at home in the cockpit despite the CHOP
tof the blades and the pilot pressed up against him.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttDo you love Drew?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>tt...There's a start for a meeting.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI know it's none of my business --

tSusan doesn't answer for a moment, then impulsively kisses her
tfather on the cheek.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttNo, it's none of your business.

tAnother moment.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttDo you love Drew?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYou mean like you loved Mom?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttForget about me and Mom -- are you
ttgoing to marry him?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttProbably.

tA moment.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttt(smiles)
ttDon't get carried away.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttUh oh --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttSusan, you're a hell of a woman.
ttYou've got a great career, you're
ttbeautiful --

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttAnd I'm your daughter and no man
ttwill ever be good enough for me.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWell, I wasn't going to say that --

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWhat were you going to say?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttListen, I'm crazy about the guy --
ttHe's smart, he's aggressive, he
ttcould carry Parrish Communications
ttinto the 21st century and me along
ttwith it.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttSo what's wrong with that?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThat's for me.  I'm talking about
ttyou.  It's not so much what you say
ttabout Drew, it's what you don't say.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYou're not listening --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttOh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of
ttexcitement, not a whisper of a
ttthrill, this relationship has all
ttthe passion of a pair of titmice.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttDon't get dirty, Dad --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWell, it worries me.  I want you
ttto get swept away.  I want you to
ttlevitate.  I want you to sing with
ttrapture and dance like a dervish.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttThat's all?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttBe deliriously happy.  Or at least
ttleave yourself open to be.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>tt'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going
ttto do my upmost --

tHe smiles.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI know it's a cornball thing but
ttlove is passion, obsession, someone
ttyou can't live without.  If you
ttdon't start with that, what are you
ttgoing to end up with?  I say fall
tthead over heels.  Find someone you
ttcan love like crazy and who'll love
ttyou the same way back.  And how do
ttyou find him?  Forget your head and
ttlisten to your heart.  I'm not
tthearing any heart.
ttt(a moment)
ttRun the risk, if you get hurt, you'll
ttcome back.  Because, the truth is
ttthere is no sense living your life
ttwithout this.  To make the journey
ttand not fall deeply in love -- well,
ttyou haven't lived a life at all.
ttYou have to try.  Because if you
tthaven't tried, you haven't lived.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttBravo.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttAw, you're tough.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI'm sorry.  But give it to me again.
ttThe short version.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttStay open.  Who knows?  Lightning
ttcould strike.

tSilence.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttForgive the lecture --

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI won't.  And when I tell Drew about
ttit, he won't either.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYou won't tell him, and even if you
ttdid, he'd clock it and punch it into
tthis laptop in order to pull out some
ttkey phrases when he gives the
ttCommencement Speech at Wharton.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYou're terrible.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI know.  But I'm the only father
ttyou've got.

tShe kisses him on the cheek.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttThank God.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttHe doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.

<b>tEXT. 34TH STREET HELIPAD, NEW YORK CITY - DAY
</b>
tThe AStar lands, an attendant, waiting with a luggage cart,
trushes to open the door and unload the bags.  The passengers,
tParrish paired with Quince, Drew with Susan, file off the
trooftop through a door which opens into an elevator.

<b>tINT. ELEVATOR, NEW YORK CITY - DAY
</b>
tParrish, Susan, Drew and Quince face forward as they ride
tdownwards.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttHey, this is it, the hour approach-
ttes, I'm getting all excited.  So
ttwhat do you think, is it --
ttt(indicates Drew and
ttt Parrish)
tt-- just the 'Executive Committee' or
ttcould you guys use me?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttQuince, m'man, thanks for the offer,
ttbut it's all set for just me and Bill.
ttMore people might --

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttI know.  Gum up the works.

tParrish is about to make some reassuring comment to Quince
twhen the Voice suddenly intrudes:

<b>ttt     VOICE (V.O.)
</b>tt'...I know, it's none of my
ttbusiness.'

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttI was saying to Quince we won't
ttneed --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttDid you just hear something?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttWhy yes, Bill, I was saying to
ttQuince --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttNo no, not you.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttDaddy, what's the matter?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttNothing.  I'm sorry.

tA respectful silence, the elevator continues downwards,
tsuddenly the Voice intrudes again:

<b>ttt     VOICE (V.O.)
</b>tt'...I want you to levitate.  I want
ttyou to sing with rapture and dance
ttlike a dervish.'

tParrish grunts bizarrely, Susan notices and reacts:

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWhat is it, Daddy --?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttNothing.

tParrish's eyes dart about, confirming no one has heard a
tthing but him.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttJust talking to myself again.  You
ttknow me --

tThe elevator door opens.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWell, here we are --

tParrish leads the group out.

<b>tEXT. 34TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY - DAY
</b>
tThey exit the building.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttt(to Parrish)
ttAre you okay?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttA-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears
ttpricked.  I'm ready for action.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWell, go get 'em, Pops.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYer damn right.

tParrish, followed by Drew, steps into a waiting limousine,
tQuince looks longingly after them.  Susan, blowing a kiss
tgoodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a
tcab.

<b>tINT. LOBBY, BONTECOU WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttSounds good.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttIt's going to be great --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttDo you think I need a haircut?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttBill, after this deal, you'll be
ttable to afford one.

tParrish smiles, they step into the elevator.

<b>tINT. BONTECOU EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY
</b>
tParrish and Drew emerge from the elevator, Parrish observing
tthe overkill decor.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttTheir PR guy asked me, what did I
ttthink Parrish Communications stood
ttfor, that's principle and ethics-
ttwise?  I came up with something, but
ttthen it occurred to me, why don't I
ttask Bill?  What do you think?

tA moment, Parrish shrugs.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttOur first annual report, must be
ttthirty-five years ago now, I owned
tttwo stations, I wrote down a state-
ttment of purpose, that one day you
ttwould wake up to a Parrish radio
ttstation, read a Parrish paper at
ttbreakfast, catch our news on tele-
ttvision during the day, and go to bed
ttwith one of our books or magazines
ttand you would always be told the
tttruth and in the bargain, have a
ttgood time.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttThat's great!  Wait 'til I show it
ttto Bontecou.

tDrew opens a door, a conference room, a circle of top exec-
tutives, now stepping out from the group is a huge, white-
thaired man, JOHN BONTECOU, 55.

<b>ttt     BONTECOU
</b>ttBill, thanks for coming over...

ttAnd how're you doing today, Drew?
ttt(to Parrish)
ttYou've got a firecracker here, the

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttGood, good.  Glad to hear it.

<b>tttBONTECOU
</b>ttWe've met before, y'know, that White

ttI was?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI'm sorry, I don't recall --

<b>ttt     BONTECOU
</b>ttLeft field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I
ttwant to come in from the outfield,
ttbat cleanup like you have, learn the
ttplush ropes --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI thought you were buying my company.

<b>ttt     BONTECOU
</b>ttOh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy
ttParrish Communications.  I could pay
ttfor it, of course, but it would
ttalways have your imprint.

tSilence.  Parrish looks around at the circle of 'suits',
tBontecou holding away.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWell, that's very nice to hear.

tDrew nods excitedly.

<b>tEXT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL CORNELL MEDICAL CENTER - DAY
</b>
tThe busy medical community at 68th Street and New York Avenue.

<b>tINT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK AVENUE - DAY
</b>
tA thriving eatery diagonally across from the hospital's
tentrance, customers cheek-by-jowl as a pair of waiters
tjuggle breakfasts served to a noisy throng of doctors,
tresidents and interns.

tSusan has squeezed into a seat in the corner.  A counterman,
twith a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front
tof her.  A sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for
tthe day; immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her
tspeaking into the pay phone.

tAn attractive YOUNG MAN, early 30's, a pair of suitcase at
this feet, a raincoat slung over his shoulder.

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>tt...Honey, you've got to go on...

tThe Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an
toverflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the
tcounterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the
tbreakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take
ther eyes off him.  He senses her eyes, glances over, his
tcheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly.

</b>ttGood morning, I was talking kind of
ttloud there, sorry.

tdespite his swift entrance.

tHe passes through an open set of doors and he is into his
town suite, commanded by JENNIFER, his assistant.

</b>ttGood morning, Mr. Parrish.

tJennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile, rises and moves to
tParrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but
tParrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes
tit, returns to her desk.

<b>tINT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tAlone in his office, Parrish's ebullient mood immediately
tchanges.  Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares
tout through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the
tManhattan skyline: cogitates.

tHe takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he
tflinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder.  It is sharp
tbut brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he
tignores it.

tParrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the
tpain comes again.  He reaches for his shoulder, tries to
tmassage the pain, it does not subside.  Parrish stands,
ttrying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some-
tthing is unmistakably wrong.  Now a SOUND which he has
tcome to recognize, makes itself heard:

<b>ttt     VOICE (V.O.)
</b>ttYes.

tFrozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the
tsource of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction,
tyet surrounds him.  Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply
tintensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a
tcorner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other
tclutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently
tseized the upper part of his body.  He breaks out in a sweat,
this pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself:

ttt     VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
tt...Yes.

tParrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him
ton the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer,
teach aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself,
tconsumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a
thallucination but which he is certain is not.  Parrish is
tpossessed.  He angles his face in every direction, arbi-
ttrarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously,
tenrage, responds to the Voice.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>tt'Yes' what?

<b>ttt     VOICE
</b>tt'Yes' is the answer to your
ttquestion.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI didn't ask any question.

<b>ttt     VOICE
</b>ttI believe you did.

tParrish is absolutely confounded, seized up with pain and
tconsternation at this unseen Voice which has such presence
tand reality.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWho are you?

tSilence.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttGoddammit, what is going on?!

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI don't!

</b>ttWhat you were talking about.

tParrish gasps.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWhat is this?  Who is this fucking
ttguy?

tHe holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping,
this skin ashen.  Now he addresses the Voice again, searching
tfor it in another direction:

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttTell me who you are!

<b>ttt     VOICE
</b>ttAre you giving me orders?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI'm sorry, I --

<b>ttt     VOICE
</b>ttNo, you're not.  You're trying to
tt'handle' the situation but this is
ttthe one situation you knew you never
ttcould handle.

tA spasm, the worst one yet, finally it subsides and there is
tan eerie silence in the room, a VOID, almost more disturbing
tthan the voice that has filled it.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWhere are you?  Are you there?

<b>ttt     VOICE
</b>ttIt's enough now.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttPlease.  Talk to me --

<b>ttt     VOICE
</b>ttThere's going to be plenty of time

</b>ttI think you know --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttKnow what?
ttt(a moment)
ttKnow what, goddammit!

tThe VOICE is gone.  Parrish searches the corner, but the
troom has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by
tthe VOICE, it is now just Parrish's office.  Faint SQUEALS of
ttraffic from the street, then a KNOCK at the door.

tParrish touches his shoulder, the pain is gone, but he is
tstill wet with sweat, the KNOCK again.  Parrish straightens
thimself up, adjusts his tie, runs his fingers through his
thair, blinks as he addresses the door.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttt(carefully)
ttCome in.

tJennifer enters.

<b>ttt     JENIFER
</b>ttI've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish.

</b>ttSure.

</b>ttLunch is 'in' today, have you given

<b>ttt     JENIFER
</b>ttNothing?

tParrish is within himself, doesn't answer.

ttt     JENIFER (cont'd)
ttWhy don't I think of something?

tParrish still doesn't answer, however Jennifer is satisfied,
tcorrectly hearing his silence as an affirmative.  She has her
thand on the door, 'Open' or 'Closed'?  He nods and she closes it.
tUtter silence again.  Parrish's eyes search the room, nothing
tthere.

tParrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttAbout what?

</b>ttI want to have a look around before
ttI take you.

tt...'Yes'.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYes what?

<b>ttt     VOICE
</b>tt'Yes' is the answer to your ques-

</b>ttWhat question?

<b>ttt     VOICE
</b>ttBill.  Come on.  The question.  The
ttquestion you've been asking yourself
ttwith increased regularity, at odd
ttmoments, panting through the extra
ttgame of handball, when you ran for
ttthe plane in Delhi, when you sat up
ttin bed last night and hit the floor
ttin the office this morning.  The
ttquestion that is in the back of your

ttover as you put it to yourself --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThe 'question' --

<b>ttt     VOICE
</b>ttt(urging)
ttYes, Bill.  The question.

tAfter a moment.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>tt...Am I going to die?

tThe figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no
tlonger obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re-
tvealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the
tcoffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off-
tcenter, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttYes.

tA moment, Parrish beside himself.  He cannot bring himself
tto speak, finally:

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttAm I dreaming this?
ttt(Another moment)
ttAre you a dream?

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttI am not a dream.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYou're coming to 'take me'.  What is
ttthat?  Who the hell are you?

tThe Young Man steps closer to Parrish, his face is inches
tfrom a shaking, sweating Parrish's face, the Young Man
tdaring Parrish to identify him:

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYou are --?

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>tt  t(urging again)
tt'...Yes --'

tParrish turns away.  But the Young Man, spectacularly, is in
tfront of him again.

ttt     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
ttt(gently)
ttWho am I?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>tt...Death.

tParrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what
the has comprehended.  He surveys the Young Man who, at this
tmoment, actually seems bewildered by his effect.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttYou're Death?

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttDeath!

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttThat's me.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYou're not Death.  You're just a kid
ttin a jacket and a pair of pants.

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttThe jacket and the pair of pants
ttcame with the body I took.  Let me
ttask your opinion.  Do I blend in?

tA hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYou want me to be your guide --?

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttYou fill the bill, Bill.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI do?
ttt(a moment)
ttHow long will you be staying?

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttYou should hope quite a while.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttAnd then --?

tThe Young Man nods, gently.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttIt's... it's... over.

tA long silence.  Parrish and the Young Man take each other in,
tthe sense that now they understand each other.  A SOUND at the
tdoor.

<b>ttt     LUISA (O.S.)
</b>ttMr. Parrish?

tParrish does not hear her for the moment, Luisa steps inside
tthe Library.

ttt     LUISA (cont'd)
ttWill the gentleman be staying for
ttdinner, sir?

tParrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at Luisa then
tat the Young Man, then once more at both of them as if to
tverify the Young Man's presence has been acknowledged by
tLuisa.  The Young Man interjects:

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttt(to Luisa)
ttYes.
ttt(a polite afterthought)
ttThank you.

tLuisa nods perfunctorily and exits.  Parrish is frozen,
tdumbfounded.

ttt     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
ttt(to Parrish)
ttWhere is dinner?

tParrish does not answer at first.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThis is crazy -- you're not going to

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttBill, I am eating dinner with you.
ttAnd your family.  And that's what
ttwe're doing.  It's not open for

ttyou understand?

tParrish is frightened by the response.

ttt     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
ttGood.  Now lead the way.

tParrish hesitates, then obediently leads the Young Man out
tof the library, down a long hallway and across the foyer.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttExcuse me?  Could I say something?

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttOf course.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttIt just occurred to me --

</b>ttSpeak up, please.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttt(louder)

</b>tt...Well, here's another possibility.
ttIt's a little last minute, but how does
ttthis strike you?  Kaleidoscopes. Little

ttthings up, they're perfect party favors,
tthowever they're not personal, they're

ttand dachshunds...

tParrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward
tpause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family
tdinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully survey-
ted.  Finally, Allison breaks the ice:

ttt     ALLISON (cont'd)
ttt(to the Young Man)
ttHi there --

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttHello.

tParrish is horribly uncomfortable as the Young Man looks at
teach person as if he were discovering a face of the first
ttime.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttUh -- sorry -- to have stepped away
ttfor so long -- uh -- this is a
ttfriend of mine I asked to drop by --

tParrish drifts into another awkward pause.

ttwould introduce you?

tt'...How nice to meet you.'

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttOh, I'm sorry.  This is my daughter,

tParrish drifts off as the Young Man awkwardly shakes hands
twith each person.

tidentified as "JOE".)

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttJust plain 'Joe'?

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttLove that name.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttMe, too.  Hey, buddy!

tJoe, turned on by Quince's broad smile, reacts to it as Drew
tsquints observingly at Joe.

ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttLike 'Smith' or 'Jones --'

tParrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name,
ta furtive glance at Joe.  Parrish's brow darkens and a name
ttumbles from his lips:

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>tt-- Black.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttWhew, at last.  Nice to meet you,

</b>ttAre you?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttHe is!  Let's sit down --

tLuisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which
twas taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned.
tJoe looks over at the other guests, then picks up his uten-
tsils gingerly, strives to copy the others, stops, staring at
this foot.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttt(to Joe)
ttPaillarde of veal.

</b>ttYou and Bill old friends?

tParrish jumps in:

</b>ttNo --

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttt(to Joe)
ttI get the feeling you've done some

</b>ttt(to Parrish)
ttJoe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I

ttbroad strokes already.  Need any
tthelp with the details?

tParrish falls silent again, looking for an answer.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttI'm sorry -- business at dinner...
ttt(to Joe)
ttForgive me for being so rude.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttSure.

tThe doors to the dining room open, Susan appears.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttHi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -
tthad to have dinner with my depart-
ttment chief --

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttYou ate?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>tt...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't
ttmiss a loose end meeting.  What's on
ttthe table for discussion?  Party
ttfavors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --

tShe kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have ob-
tviously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water
ttoys and their lips meeting mid-air.

tAt the kiss's conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is
tpresent and has been watching.  She is shocked, embarrassed,
tpleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttWhat are you doing here?

tSilence.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttt(stunned)
ttYou know each other?

ttWe've met.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWhat?!

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>tt-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee
ttShop.  He was looking for a doctor.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttWell, I guess he's found one.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttJoe, you do get around.

tJoe is happily confounded by all the interaction.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttThat's your name?

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttAnd isn't it a lovely one?  So
ttsturdy, so straight --

tJoe has heard Susan's question but, as he studies her,
tdoesn't answer.

</b>ttIncidentally, Joe, where're you
ttstaying?

</b>ttHere...

</b>ttIn this house?

</b>ttGreat!

tParrish pushes his plate away.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttUh - will that hold you, Joe?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttIncidentally, 'Joe' what?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttBlack.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttHey, this is fun.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttSo, what are you doing here?

tParrish tenses, but Joe doesn't answer.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttCat got your tongue?  You weren't so
ttsilent this morning.

tDrew reacts to this allusion of intimacy.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttNow, I'm getting interested.  I want
ttto know more ---

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttt(to Joe)
ttWe've got some things to discuss.

tt-- Did I hear 'business'?

</b>ttWhat 'business'?

tttried.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttIt's so very nice to see you again.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttFunny, I don't get that feeling.
ttMaybe it's because you found out
ttI'm Bill Parrish's daughter.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttCut it out, Susan.
ttt(to Joe)
ttYou and I've got to talk.  Big day
tttomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.

tJoe rises, follows Parrish to the door, stops:

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttt(to Susan)
ttSusan.
ttt(to Allison)
ttAllison.
ttt(to Quince)
ttQuince.
ttt(to Drew)
ttDrew.
ttt(to Parrish)
ttBill...
ttt(to the group)
ttThank you.

tHe makes an awkward little bow, then heads for the nearest
tdoor.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttJoe, that's the kitchen.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttThank you.

tJoe pivots, and he follows Parrish out the proper door.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttThat was 'Joe'.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttHe's cute.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttVery.

tSusan's eyes are still on the door where Joe exited, her
tface reflecting her irritation and bewilderment, as well as
ta tinge of excitement.

tthe huge house.

</b>tt...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon-
ttcerted, that stuff between you and

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttShook me up.  I mean that you knew

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI didn't know her.  The body I took
ttknew her.  The man she met in the

tttook him.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttSo there's nothing between you and

</b>ttIt hadn't occurred to me until then.

tParrish suddenly looks very anxious, Joe stops.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttYou seem uncomfortable, Bill.

tt...Chair, lamp, bed --

tParrish is in a stunned state, chatters on unconsciously:

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttBox springs, they're assembled in

ttmanager's house there unexpectedly
tt- best night's sleep I ever had.

</b>ttWhat a good idea.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThank you.  Would you like the man's

tParrish glances around, a room in which the occupant could
tnot want for anything.

</b>ttIf there is anything else, don't

tteverything was fine.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYour doctor?
ttt(icily)
ttDid your doctor say anything about
tta tiny, undetectable hole in your
ttaorta?  Did he mention an irreparab-

ttemper.

tt...But meanwhile, you are still
tthere.  Count your blessings.  Call
ttit gravy, frosting on the cake,

tattentive.

<b>ttt     LUISA

tdistance, ruminates.

<b>tINT. GUEST ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tJoe has been examining his room, full of curiosity and
twonderment at the oddest things, the handle on a casement
twindow, the hem and weight of the fabric of a drape, hinges
ton the bedroom door.  In the process he opens this door,
tsteps out into the hallway.

<b>tINT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

tJoe wanders down the hallway past the occasional Dufy or
tMiro, a Venetian tapestry cheek-by-jowl with a miniature
tMing vae, and even a Bonsai garden with a trickling vein
tof water.

<b>tINT. KITCHEN HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

tIn the "back" of the house now, utilitarian paint and decor,
tthe SOUND of laughter and a glare of light.  Joe enters.

<b>tINT. KITCHEN, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe staff is at ease, some smoking, remains of food around.
tCoyle, the butler, has his back to Joe and does not see him
tfor a moment.  In front of Coyle, an open jar of peanut but-

tJoe is fascinated by the process.  Coyle suddenly hears the
tsilence, looks up and see Joe, standing up embarrassedly.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttHello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet

<b>ttt     COYLE
</b>ttYes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.

tThe staff all mumble expansive "Good evening, sir"s to Joe.
tHe motions to them to sit, they do but Coyle does not.  Coyle
tshifts from foot-to-foot, the staff is not used to having
tParrish family or guests in this part of the house.

</b>ttt(to Coyle)
ttWhat are you eating.

<b>ttt     COYLE
</b>ttYou mean this, sir?

ttLaura Scudder's Peanut Butter.

tt'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.
ttt(a moment)
ttYou like it?

<b>ttt     COYLE
</b>ttI would say, sir, it is right up
ttthere with Jif and Skippy.  But
ttmiles ahead of Peter Pan.
ttt(another moment)
ttLike a taste?

tJoe nods, Coyle fashions a spoonful, offers it to Joe.  Joe
tswallows it.  But he has not yet found a comfortable way of
tmasticating, his mouth and tongue go every which way, the
tstaff observes him, fascinated.

ttt     COYLE (cont'd)
ttYou're a peanut butter man now, eh,
ttsir?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYes, I am.  I thoroughly enjoyed
ttthis - uh - peanut butter.
ttt(to the staff)
ttAnd I thoroughly enjoyed meeting
ttyou.

tJoe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast
tto the staff.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttI'll be moseying on.

tHe heads out, with the spoonful of peanut butter, to cheer-
tful "Goodnight, Mr. Black"'s, his tongue again licking the
tedges of the spoon.

tA spectacular indoor Olympic pool, window commanding views
tof the skyline.

tSusan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black
tSpeedo suit, Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter.
tHe observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as
tshe makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection
tfrom a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is.

<b>ttt     SUSAN

</b>ttI'm lost.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>tt-- Can't seem to escape you today.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI'm sorry.

tSusan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder,
tpoints to a stack of towels.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttHand me one of those, will you?

tJoe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the
tspoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand,
tcan't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants
tthe spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and
tpresents it to Susan.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttYou must have something really big

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYou appear at his side out-of-the-

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttThat is not my intention.

tJoe continues to nibble at his peanut butter.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWhat are your intentions?  To make
ttlittle dreams in coffee shops, turn
tta woman's head, and I don't mind
ttadmitting it was turned, I liked it,
ttbut ten hours later I feel like a

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttt(mumbles)
ttPeanut butter.

tHe finishes the spoonful.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttBut it's gone now.

tHe shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in
this pocket, realizes this is inappropriate.  Susan holds her
thand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the
tspoon on the table with the towels.  She watches, fascinat-
ted, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his
tspoonful.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYou act like you never had peanut

</b>ttDid you know you have a wet spot on

tShe glances at her shoulder, he grabs a towel, touches the
tdrops of water, pats them dry, hands her the towel.  She
tflashes a nervous smile.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttGoodnight, Joe.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttGoodnight to you, Susan.

tSusan steps towards a door, Joe takes a step in the wrong
tdirection, they almost walk into each other.  Now she takes
ta step in another direction, as does Joe, again they almost
tcollide.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttShall we dance?

tJoe is completely puzzled, finally Susan heads for one door,
tJoe for another.

tSusan indicates yet another door.

</b>ttt(after a moment)
ttThank you.

tJoe redirects himself, goes to the door.  As they both are
tabout to exit, Joe and Susan sneak furtive looks at each
tother across the pool, smile at catching each other's
tglances.  Joe exits.  For a moment Susan's eyes remain on
tthe door through which he has gone.  Now she grips the towel
tover her shoulders, the one Joe gave her, pats the same spot
the did.

tParrish, dressed for the day, passes servants busy with
ttheir morning tasks, polishing doorknobs, putting away
tlinen, dusting picture frames.  He nods and greets them as
the strides down the hall, brisk "Good morning"'s to Coyle
tand Luisa.

<b>tINT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttOh, I wouldn't tell them anything,

ttthose mighty things you seem so
ttintent on imparting, but I am cer-

ttabruptly.

tParrish regards Joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing
tof silk stretching across his collarbone.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttBut I did so enjoy your family.

tParrish is startled, he regards Joe carefully.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWhat about my family?  This 'adven-

tSilence as Joe considers the point, Parrish quickly crosses
tto him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttTell you what, you promised that it's
ttgoing to be only me and --

</b>ttBill --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYes?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYou've got a deal.

tParrish seems relieved.  He has now, with some difficulty,
tcompleted the tying of Joe's tie, adjusts it beautifully on
tJoe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror.
tJoe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the
tballs of his feet, quite taken.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttThis is great!
ttt(a moment)
ttNow what do we do?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttShake hands.

tJoe immediately extends his hand toward Parrish, but
tParrish freezes on seeing the hand, stares at it, now takes
tit.  Joe pumps Parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a
tbroad smile.

<b>tEXT. 5TH AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

tParrish and Joe striding downtown, Joe's jacket fits per-
tfectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part
tof the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work.  Parrish
tsenses Joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check-
ting out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the
ttop of corporate high-rises.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYou know, I got to thinking last

tA flicker from Joe.  He has heard what Parrish has said, his
teyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but
the is concentrating on Parrish's words.

</b>ttWhen you were shaving this morning,

</b>ttWhat do you mean?

tThey stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at home
tin his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, un-
tcharacteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his
tlips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out:

</b>ttI understand.

tA moment.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttBut you can't.

tA sudden silence between them.  Parrish's shoulders appear
tto have stopped slightly, the courage he displayed at rais-

treflective, deeply felt.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttUmm -- I did enjoy -- or rather I
ttwas interested in meeting John yes-
ttterday -- impressive... I suppose...
ttBut it did get me to thinking.  I
ttstarted in this business because
ttthis is what I wanted to do.  I knew
ttI wasn't going to write the Great
ttAmerican Novel, but I also knew
ttthere was more to life than buying
ttsomething for a dollar and selling
ttit for two.  I wanted to give the
ttnews to the world, and I wanted to
ttgive it unvarnished.  The more we
ttall know about each other, the
ttgreater the chance we will survive.
ttSure, I want to make a profit, you
ttcan't exist without one but John
ttBontecou is all profit.  If we give
tthim license to absorb Parrish
ttCommunications, and he has his eye
tton a few others after us, we'll be
ttappointing him to the position he
ttcraves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to
ttreach the world you will have to go
ttthrough John Bontecou.  And not only
ttwill you have to pay him to do this,
ttfar more expensive, you'll have to
ttagree with him.  Reporting the news
ttis a privilege and a responsibility
ttand it is not exploitable.  Parrish
ttCommunications has earned this priv-
ttilege, John Bontecou wants to buy
ttit.  As your chairman, I urge you to
ttagree this company is not for sale.

tA silence, everybody shifts, the Board is in shock, Drew is
ttrying to maintain his balance.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttThat's your privilege, Bill.  But

tcoolly grasps the irritation of the members.  Parrish breaks
tthe silence.

tThe guests try to return to their food, Susan is the most
tconcerned about Parrish's lapse, she does not say anything
tbut Drew next to her senses her empathy and, in something of
ta display, gives her a pro forma hug.  Joe has observed
tevery instant of Drew's performance, his anxiety is palpable
twhen Coyle leans over to serve him, offering a tray of a
troast that has been carved.

</b>ttDid he?  That's more than we get to

</b>ttWell, maybe next time Joe goes,

</b>ttYou're on, Quin-cee.  Destination

</b>ttWhat way would you put it?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYou tell me, Bill.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttHow about you telling me?  When I

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttInclude me out.  I've had enough of

</b>ttYou don't mean that.  You wouldn't

ttAnd so do you.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttDrew, you're out of line.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttThat may be.  But I don't like the

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttSorry, but I like the way he looks
ttand talks to me.  And vice versa.

</b>ttWell... goodnight.

</b>ttYeah.  Goodnight.

tDrew goes, Susan turns to find out at the far end of the foyer,

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttHow long have you been standing
ttthere?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI don't like the way Drew spoken to

ttbecause of the way you spoke back.

tA moment.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttTell me about yourself, Joe.  Who
ttyou are.  What you're doing with my
ttfather.

tSusan's directness has caught him by surprise, Joe blinks.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttSo you're not going to tell me?

tJoe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by Susan's
tinquiries.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttYou're married, aren't you?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttBecause guys who never say anything
ttabout themselves are always married.

tJoe doesn't respond.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttSo you are married.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttNo, I'm not.

</b>ttGirlfriend?

</b>ttNo.

</b>ttGay?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttThen tell me, Joe, how come a man
ttas attractive, intelligent, well-
ttspoken ,diffident in the most sed-

tJoe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted
tby Susan.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttI'm sorry, I don't want to pry and
ttyou don't want to tell me.  So let's
ttleave it a mystery.  That's the way
ttyou want it, isn't it?

tSusan takes another step closer to Joe.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttThank you, I appreciate that.

tThey are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds
tthem, a heaviness to the moment, now Joe turns to head up the
tstairs.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWhere are you going?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttt(softly)
ttTo bed.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttt(suddenly fragile)
tt'To bed'?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYes.  I'm tired.

tHe excuses himself with an ineffable gesture, now climbs the
tstairs, Susan watches him disappear.

tShe turns back into the salon just as Allison and Quince are
texiting, "good-byes" all around.  Susan is left alone now
twith Parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThat was wonderful.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYeah, it's good to get together.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttDo you mind if I raise a little

</b>ttRaise away.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWhat is the nature of your interest
ttin Joe?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWell, remember how you told me about
tt"lightning striking"?  The nature of
ttit's in there somewhere.

tParrish drops another cube of ice in his drink, takes his
ttime before answering.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI won't say you may be getting onto
ttshaken ground --

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttThen what will you say?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI don't think this is the lightning
ttyou are looking for.  Drew's a good
ttman.  I know I didn't seem to be
ttcompletely in his corner before, but
ttI've come to appreciate --

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttNow we love Drew and Joe in verbo-
ttten?  What's going on?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttNothing.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWhen you say 'nothing' that way,
ttit's not nothing.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThen what is it?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttIt's something.

tShe kisses him.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttG'night, Daddy.  See you tomorrow.
ttThis is getting interesting.

tShe goes.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. THE CARLYLE HOTEL - NEXT DAY
</b>
tA large suite, room service carts creaking with pots of
tcoffee and half-eaten pastries.  The Board of Parrish
tCommunications is gathered, absent are Parrish and Quince.
tFelicia, Drew's secretary, takes notes.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>tt...I know you're all as uncomfor-
tttable as I am to be meeting without
ttBill, but I got a call last night
ttfrom John Bontecou.  Not only is he
ttstill interested, he is sweetening
tthis offer.
ttt(a moment)
ttAlthough it pains me to say it, in
ttmy opinion Bill Parrish dealt with
ttus peremptorily in dismissing any
ttdeal with Bontecou.  Therefore, I'm
ttsorry to say that if we are to exam-
ttine this new offer responsibly as
ttthe Board of Directors of Parrish
ttCommunications, we must do so with-
ttout its Chairman.
ttt(another moment)
ttOh yes, there is one additional
ttelement: Bontecou is so anxious to
ttget us, he said he'd take Parrish
ttCommunications with our Chairman or
ttwithout.

tThe Board falls silent.  Sloane, a peer of Parrish's,
tfidgets.  Drew milks the moment.

ttt     DREW (cont'D)
ttIt's no surprise if I suggest to you
ttthat the Bill Parrish we know is not
ttthe Bill Parrish you saw yesterday.
ttYou heard that speech -- some strange
ttemotional rationale to buttress a
ttknee-jerk rejection of a legitimate
ttoffer.  Does it not strike you that
ttsomething is possibly affecting this
ttman's judgement?  More specifically
tt-- his judgement to make a critical
ttbusiness decision?

tSilence, the Board clocking Drew's argument.

ttt     DREW (cont'D)
ttIt's not pleasant to say the follow-
tting, but I would be remiss, in this
ttcrisis, if I did not.  When we pre-
ttsent Bill with the improved Bontecou
ttoffer, and if he refuses to let us
ttconsider it -- once more makes an
ttadamant or emotional rejection -- we
ttwill have no choice but to seek an
ttalternative.

<b>ttt     SLOANE
</b>ttAnd what would that be?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttBill's birthday is the day after
tttomorrow.  There is a provisory by-

<b>ttt     SLOANE
</b>ttYou're taking this too far, Drew.

tthe room.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttHow did this all come about?  Crisis
tt-- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com-
ttpany, crisis for us.  I came about
ttwith the arrival on the scene of --
ttMr. Joe Black.  Mr. Joe who?  Joe
ttBlack.  He attends our Board meet-
ttint, he sleeps at Bill's house, re-
ttsides in his office.  Never leaves
tthis side.  And, in my opinion, is
ttalways in his ear.  Telling him what
ttto do and Bill is listening.  Who is
ttJoe Black?  What is his relationship
ttto Bill Parrish?  And most important,
ttwhat is behind his influence on our
ttChairman?

<b>ttt     SLOANE
</b>ttYou're building this thing up too
ttmuch, Drew.  He's had advisors be-
ttfore.  Nobody tells Bill what to do.

tprised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttThank you for coming.

</b>ttHello, Quince.

<b>ttt     SLOANE
</b>ttt(acidly)
ttThis is a secret meeting.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttt(to Quince)
ttI hope you'll respect its nature --
ttWhat we're trying to do here is
ttgather our thoughts -- in light of
ttBill's rejection of Bontecou's offer
tt-- and make an appropriate presenta-
tttion to him as to how we think the
ttcompany might proceed.  Won't you
ttshare with our Board the information
ttyou gave me last night?

tQuince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind.
tHe nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the
tBoard.

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttWell, I'm happy to tell you I've got
ttgood news.  As I was telling Drew,
ttI've been making a little hay while
ttthe Bontecou sun was shining -- two,
ttpossibly three new and boiling hot
ttprospects for merger.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttHow did Bill react to the leads
ttyou've developed?

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttHe was interested.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttt(prompting)
tt-- But he was concerned about the
tttiming?

<b>ttt     QUINCE

ttto Joe.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>tt'It's up to Joe'?

<b>ttt     QUINCE
</b>ttThat's what he said.

tQuince, having dispensed his information, looks proudly
taround at the Board members.  They are stunned, Sloane in
tshock.  Drew is absolutely still, letting Quince's words
tsink in.

<b>tINT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tParrish, Joe, Susan, Allison and Quince are seated at the
ttable, dessert plates in front of them, coffee cups beside.
tAllison and Susan's eyes are on Parrish, looking for some
tclue as to why has he gathered the family together yet
tagain.  Parrish is somewhat within himself, but he peeks
tover his demi-tasse cup at Joe, Parrish aware of Joe's
theightened interest in Susan, and Susan's reciprocation.

tCoyle enters carrying two imposing stemmed silver trays with
tcakes on them, Luisa follows with one other.  They set them
tdown in front of Parrish.

tQuince puts a reassuring arm around Allison, she seems to
trelax now, Joe has been a keen observer of what has trans-
tpired between husband and wife, between man and woman, a
tsense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation-
tship.

<b>tINT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

tgether.  At the bar on the other side of the room, Joe
twatches as Quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWhose?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttYours.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI'm feeling real uncomfortable right
ttnow because the guy who reports to
ttme is threatening me.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttI'm just giving you the truth.  There
ttwas a time when William Parrish liked
ttthe truth.

tJoe, although across the room, is all attention.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI think it's time you went home,
ttDrew.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttCertainly.  Goodnight.

tDrew goes, everybody is in shock, Susan pursues him out into
tthe hallway.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttDrew!

tHe stops.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttNever talk to my father like that
ttagain.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttDon't worry about it.  There's a
ttbeginning and a middle and an end
ttto everything.  And I think I've
ttcome to the end of my chapter with

tJoe has followed them into the hallway.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttAnd the end began with this guy.

tDrew looks down towards Joe.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttMr. Black --?  We ran a check on you

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttNo, I don't --

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttNot good, not bad, you know what we
ttgot?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars,
ttno mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.

tJoe waits.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttAll of a sudden a guy appears on the
ttscene with the Chairman of one of
ttthe greatest communications corpora-
tttions of the world, the boss makes
tthim privy to all the company's
ttsecrets, he attends the Board meet-
ttings, and us working stiffs with
ttMBA's up the ass and years and years
ttand years of experience, we're left
ttoutside with our noses pressed
ttagainst the window.

tJoe doesn't respond.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttThis is a big-time operation, deal-
tting in big-time issues, demanding
ttbig-time executives who make big-
tttime decisions.  So, Joe, why don't
ttyou tell me exactly what it is
ttthat's big time about you?

tAfter a moment.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYou first.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttt(to Drew)
ttWhy don't you get off his case?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttOh, you're the great Joe's attorney
ttnow?  Are we going to go to court?
ttOr are we going to go to bed?  And I
ttdon't mean you and me.  I mean you
ttand him.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttThat's it.  It's over.  Get out.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttSo I guess a blowjob's out of the
ttquestion?

tJoe clears his throat.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttDid you say something?

tJoe considers him evenly.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttAlmost.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttt(to Drew)
ttI said get out.

tNow Drew wheels, heads right for the front door and exits with
ta SLAM.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttWhat an angry fellow.

tA moment passes before Susan realizes she and Joe are alone,
tand Joe does as well.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI'm sorry about --

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttPlease.  We don't need to talk about
ttDrew.

tShe regards Joe.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttNo.  We don't.

tThey drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttBrave you had a chance to look at
ttDad's rare books?  Jefferson's
ttParliamentary Manual, a first
ttedition Bleak House --

tJoe comes closer, takes a deep breath.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI love your smell.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>tt-- I guess you haven't.

tNow Susan, close to Joe, leans closer, her nose in Joe's
tneck.  Joe holds himself very still.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttI like your smell, too.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttThank you.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttIt was everything.

tSilence, the TICKING of the clock.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttWhen I was little, my mother used to
ttsay, "Darling, you could set your
ttheart by this clock".

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>tt-- Could you?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttNever tried, 'til now.
ttt(suddenly)
ttJoe, may I kiss you?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttWhy, yes.  Thank you.

tA moment.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYou're welcome.

tSusan reaches out for Joe, they kiss, he is awkward but his
tvery awkwardness endearing.  Susan pulls him closer, they
tlinger now, mouths on each other's, then separate.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttThank you.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYou're welcome.

tThe clock TICKS on.  A sense of foreboding falls over Joe's
tface, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a
tpoint of no return.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttJoe?

tThe apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYes?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI don't know who you are.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttWell...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're
ttSusan.  And I - uh - have this weak
ttfeeling in my knees --

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttAnd is your heart beating strangely?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttFaster.  And I want the scent from

tAn intake of breath.  She is about to speak.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttAnd you don't even have to say a

tTheir faces inches from each other's.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI have to go home.

tBut neither Susan nor Joe moves.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttDon't I?

tHer question makes Joe, almost involuntarily, smile.  Susan
ttakes the opportunity to step back from him.  The SOUND of
tsomeone at the door, it is Parrish, Susan turns, comprehends
timmediately how the situation will appear to him.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttGoodnight, Daddy.

tShe drifts right past him, exits.  Joe and Parrish are left
talone now, eyes on each other's.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttHello, Bill.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttt(carefully)
ttHello.  Would you like to join me,

tAn awkward moment.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttOkay.  Goodnight.

</b>ttGood morning, Mr. Parrish.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttGood morning, Jennifer.

<b>ttt     JENIFER
</b>ttThe Board is waiting.

</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttt     JENIFER
</b>ttDidn't you call a Board meeting?

tJennifer sees Parrish is trying to right his balance, she
tknows better than to press the point.

ttt     JENIFER (cont'd)
ttYes, the members are waiting.  They
ttare in the Board room now.

tJennifer nods respectfully as Parrish doesn't cast a flicker
tof any further surprise, heads straight for the Board room,
tJoe right beside him.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttGood morning.

tAn odd mixture of responses, the Board sheepish and at the
tsame time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting,
tits sudden convening clearly a problem for Parrish, a prob-
tlem which he does not attempt to hide, only control.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttDid you want to have a cup of coffee
ttor something, Bill?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI don't think so.  Do you?

tDrew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out
tall the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttt(to Parrish)
ttTo get to the point, we have re-
ttceived new information from John
ttBontecou concerning his desires for
ttthis company to merge with his, and
ttwe wanted to set the details before

tA moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it
tappears he may not ever answer.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThat's it?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttBontecou wants a quick response
ttand --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThe answer is no, quick enough for

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttDon't you want to hear the details?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI'm not interested in the details.
ttAnd I'm not interested in the big
ttpicture either.  What I am inter-
ttersted in is how my Board got conven-
tted behind my back, is entertaining a
ttfurther proposal from a man whom it
ttoffends me to do business with,
ttmoreover has the audacity to present
ttthis to me like a prize fish, and I
ttam expected to clap for it like a
ttperforming seal.  No, thank you.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttSo I am to understand from your re-

ttthe details of Bontecou's offer?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYes, you are to understand that, and
ttnow may I ask you a question?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttCertainly, Bill.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttAre you running this Board or am I?

tSloane leans in.

<b>ttt     SLOANE
</b>ttWe're not getting anywhere here.

</b>ttHe'll wait --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttDoesn't need to.  Today, tomorrow,

ttfrom now -- the answer is going to
ttbe the same -- a loud, unmistakable,
ttall-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'.

tA BUZZ amongst the Board, they finally rustle into silence
tunder Parrish's withering glance.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttThat's it?  I've got a busy day
ttand this meeting has already set
ttme behind.  Shall we adjourn?

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttBefore we do, while we're here,

ttWho is the man sitting to the right
ttof you?

tEverybody's eyes are on Joe.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI've already introduced Mr. Black to
ttyou all.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttBut who is he?  What are his creden-

ttyou?

tNo response from Parrish.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttThe feeling of the Board is this: we
ttfear Mr. Black is not only influenc-
tting your decisions in regard to this
ttcompany, but that you are relying on
tthim to make them for you.

tQuince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front
tof him, his knuckles white as Parrish regards Drew, but still
tdoes not answer.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttThe lack of response, Bill, is not
ttappropriate.  We are your Board, we
tthave a right to know how you are
ttmanaging the operations of this
ttcompany, and most importantly, that
ttyou have not delegated someone to do
ttit for you.

tParrish squirms, desperately uncomfortable but still does
tnot speak.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttOkay, one more time.

tDrew regards Joe.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttWho is Joe Black?

tParrish stares stoically into the middle distance as
tQuince's head sinks into his hands.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttt(to the Board)
ttA motion has been brought before
ttthe Board to invoke Article 19 of

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttIn English, please.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttMandatory retirement upon our
ttChairman's sixty-fifth birthday.

tParrish is expressionless.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttAt which time, the Chairman will be
ttnamed Emeritus, he will be welcome
ttto attend all meetings, and will
ttserve as International Spokesman for
ttthe corporation plus, of course, a
ttsettlement, a golden parachute of
ttsuch magnitude that his feet will
ttnever touch the ground.

tDrew pauses.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttPlease indicate your vote by a "Yes"
ttor "No".

tA "Yes" is heard, now another "Yes", now more "Yes"es, all
treluctant, "No" from Sloane, "No" from Quince who realizes
the is the instrument of Parrish's dismissal.

ttt     DREW (cont'd)
ttThe motion is passed.  We will of
ttcourse delay the announcement, out
ttof respect for our former Chairman,
ttuntil after the celebration of his
ttbirthday this weekend.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThank you for allowing me to save

tJoe's eyes are riveted on Drew.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttt(to the Board)
ttThe other motion before us is the
ttacceptance of John Bontecou's offer
ttto merge this corporation with

</b>ttWhat have you done?  You've gotten

thas a thought he doesn't want to share, then heads upstairs
twith Joe.  He is trudging a bit, Joe senses his mood.

twing.

<b>tINT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY
</b>
tMidday sunlight streams into the sitting room, Joe passes
tthrough to his bedroom, sits tentatively on the bed, feels
tthe edge of the silk spread, touches the pillow, then rises
tagain, crosses back to the sitting room.

tSusan appears in the doorway, Joe suddenly senses her, turns
taround.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYou're here?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI am.

tHe stands, they regard each other for the moment.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttMay I take your coat?

tShe doesn't answer, starts to take off the coat herself, Joe
tcomes around her to help, Susan senses him breathing in the
tscent at the back of her neck.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI just thought I'd drop by, scrounge
tta little lunch, I was in the neigh-
ttborhood --

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttHow beautiful.

tHe starts to hang Susan's coat up.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttJust throw it on the chair.

tJoe holds her coat carefully on the chair.  An awkward
tmoment, the two of them shifting from foot-to-foot.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttWhen I called, they said that you
ttand Daddy had just left the office.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttHe's taking a nap.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttHe must be tired -- this Bontecou

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYes, he's tired.  I believe so.

tA moment.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttYou must be hungry?

tSusan sits on the couch.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttNo, not anymore.  Are you?

tJoe hears the question but doesn't answer, sits down on the
tcouch beside her.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
tt(after a moment)
ttAre you cold?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>tt...No.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttMaybe it's the draft through the
ttdoor.

tShe gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to
tJoe.  A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each
tother, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes
tas such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but
thas no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are
tinstinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin-
tgers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This
texcites her because she senses his untutoredness and the
tvery sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other
tare intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know-
tledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions
tare such that they never beg the question -- has he done it
tbefore.

tStrange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert-
ting his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak-
ting are so real that an emotional exchange between he and
tSusan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored land
tof feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet
tat the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself being
tlured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but
tis deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing
tis putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on.
tThe powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in
tthe end there is the knowledge they have together made a
tjourney, they both have been swept away in a stream of events
tthey have created; and they don't care about the consequences.

tSpent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks:

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttIt's so wonderful to make love to
ttyou.  It's like making love to some-
ttone who has never made love before.

tJoe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has
tsaid, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself.
tHe weighs, then resists, the impulse.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttThank you.

tHer head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his
tcomforting her without knowing that he is doing so.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttDid you like making love to me?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI loved it.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttMore than you love peanut butter?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYes!

tShe laughs at the earnestness with which he answers.

tJoe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for
tthe first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone
tto some distant, distant land.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWhere are you going?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttNowhere?  I'm...here.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttFor how long?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttOh, I hope a long, long time.

</b>ttMe, too.

tstops now at the window of a Korean grocery, something has
tcaught his eye, he steps inside.

tThrough the window, Joe can be seen making a purchase, he
thands the Korean Clerk some money, walks out.

tthrough the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for
tmusic groups, portable pools with clusters of florists
tleaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within.  Parrish
tand Joe move solemnly, observing the activity, not speaking
tto one another.  Although they are shoulder-to-shoulder,
tthere is a distance between them.  They walk on past chan-
tdeliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven
tthrough their branches.  Adding to the confusion, the AStar
tlifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling
tfrom the blast of the rotors.  May, the housekeeper, appears.

tParrish turns his attention now to an ice-filled fountain
tencircling two giant topiary letters written in faux-
tCyrillic, a 'B' and a 'P', as rubber-booted delivery men
tcarefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each

tJoe regards Quince.

tgetting close.

tas the pre-party activities swirl on around them.

<b>tEXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET (LATER)
</b>
tThe moment just before sunset, the last pre-party minutes,
ta procession of guests' cars winding up to the guest house,
tbeing directed into adjacent fields.  Susan cuts past a re-
tceiving line that files up the stairs, she skirts the house
tand heads straight for the action, the party on the lawns in
tthe rear, climbs a terrace where she commands a view of the
tevent on which the curtain is just about to rise.

<b>tEXT. LAWN, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET

tGuests milling, emerging from the crowd Susan sees, isolated
tby a fountain, Joe.  He looks up towards her, he knows she
thas seen him, they proceed to a rendezvous that has not been
tprearranged but which they intuit.  Susan slants through the
tguests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha-
ttter float on the wind, "He, Susie!",  "What a party",  "You
tlook great", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith.

tJoe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful,
tunfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is
tnot certain of, but where he knows he will find Susan.

tThe very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse
tof river, the light catching Susan and Joe as they enter the
tgarden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in
tfront of them.

</b>ttI like you in a black tie.

</b>ttAnd you can't tell me who you are.

tAgain the same indescribable gesture from Joe.

ttI'm in love with a man, I don't know

</b>ttWill it?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttLightning struck.  We caught it in

tAnother moment.

</b>tt'Love will find out the way'.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>tt'Love will find out the way'?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttIt's a saying.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI believe that, don't you?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYes, that's why I said it.

tThey are on the brink of some decision, Joe is about to make
tsome declaration when Allison is heard --

</b>ttThere you are!

tAllison appears.

ttWhat's going on here?  Tete-a-tetes
tton my big night?
ttt(to Susan)
ttC'mon honey, you're needed.
ttt(to Joe)
ttCan it wait?

tBut before he can answer --

ttt     ALLISON (cont'd)
ttGlad to hear it!
ttt(to Susan)
ttLet's go.

tShe takes Susan's arm and marches her off, Joe, in thrall,
twatches them go as the MUSIC erupts behind them, as 'up'
tdance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all.  The
tcurtain has risen on William Parrish's 65th birthday party.

tParrish is impressed by Joe's acumen, a look of grudging

</b>ttIt's time to put this person where
tthe belongs.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttIt's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's
ttgoing to step aside --

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttI'm not stepping anywhere --

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI appreciate your gentlemanliness,
ttBill, but what we need to do here is
ttdrive the dagger home --

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttThe dagger --?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI told you to shut up.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttt(to Drew)
ttPrepare yourself, Drew - I am --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttHe is --

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI'll take it from here --
ttt(to Drew)
ttI am --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>tt-- An IRS man.

tDrew is stunned, Joe glances at Parrish, hesitates.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttYes, he is.  He's an -- IRS man.
ttAren't you, Joe?

tJoe is at a loss, Parrish's eyes are glued to his, Joe gets
tthe hint.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYes, I am.
ttt(to Drew)
ttIRS man.

tDrew's head swivels from Joe to Parrish and back again.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThe Treasury Department asked
ttmy cooperation in his undercover
ttinvestigation of John Bontecou.
ttThey were convinced that Bontecou,
tton past deals, had structured his
ttmergers and acquisitions in sus-
ttpicious and complicated ways so as
ttto evade paying the taxes he is
ttliable for.  The IRS wanted to go
ttafter him, and this deal offered
ttthem the opportunity.
ttt(a moment)
ttI agreed to cooperate.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttt(to Parrish)
ttAnd we're very grateful.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttMoreover, Agent Joe Black here --
ttof course that's not his real name
tt-- smelled out your involvement,
ttDrew.  He developed evidence you
ttwere working both sides of the
ttfence.  Unfortunately, that's known
ttas a conflict of interest --

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttUndisclosed conflict of interest --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttAn offense --

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttAn indictable offense.

tSilence.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttI think I'd like to talk to my
ttlawyer --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttNo lawyers, Drew.  We're going to
ttoffer you a deal.

tDrew is all attention.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttConfess to the Board every details of
ttyour participation and then submit
ttyour resignation.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttAnd what do I get?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYou get not to go to jail.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttYou're talking through your hat.
ttYou're offering a deal because
ttyou've got no proof.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttProof?  We've got plenty of proof.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttt(to Drew)
ttAnd he's talking through his lips.

tJoe steps forward.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttMake no mistake, Drew, if you choose
ttto test my resolve in this matter,
ttyou'll be looking at an outcome that
ttwill have a finality that is beyond
ttyour comprehension, and you'll not
ttbe counting the days or the months
ttor the years, but millenniums in the
tthouse with no doors.

tDrew slumps.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttAll right, you win.  As soon as I
ttget back to the city, I'll meet with
ttthe Board.

tSloane's voice erupts over the SPEAKERPHONE.

<b>ttt     SLOANE (O.S.)
</b>ttYou're meeting with the Board right
ttnow, Drew.  Resignation accepted.
ttMoreover, I propose a motion to re-
ttconfirm William Parrish as Chairman
ttof the Board of Parrish Communica-
tttions as well as a rejection of the
ttmerger with Bontecou International.
ttHow say you, Board?

tA chorus of thunderous "Yes"es resounds through the
<b>tSPEAKERPHONE.
</b>
ttt     SLOANE (O.S., cont'd)
ttThe motion is passed.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWell, thank you, that's great, but
ttit's more than I bargained for.  I
ttjust wanted to set the record
ttstraight.

<b>ttt     SLOANE (O.S.)
</b>ttBut we want you back, Bill.  Mean-
ttwhile, enjoy your party, celebrate,
ttwe'll attend to the nasty details.
ttAnd Mr. Black, may we say thank you.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttMy pleasure.  This is an IRS Agent's
ttdream.  I'll be promoted to Chief of
ttSection off of this.

tParrish clicks the speakerphone off.  Drew is staring at
tJoe, shaking his head.

<b>ttt     DREW
</b>ttWho would've ever believed it?  You,
ttan IRS Agent --

tSilence.  Joe shrugs, smiles.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>tt'Death and Taxes'.

tThe door flies open, an anxious Allison appears.

<b>ttt     ALLISON
</b>ttDaddy!  We've been looking all over
ttfor you - this is your party - what
ttare you doing in here?  Never mind.
ttYou're on.  Let's go.

tShe pulls him out of his chair, hustles him out of the room,
tJoe right behind them.

<b>tEXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the
torchestra strikes up "Happy Birthday" as Parrish appears
twith Allison.  An enormous cake is unveiled with one great,
tlit candle, Parrish beams then laughs.  He pauses over the
tcake, now blows the candle out.  APPLAUSE, cries of "Speech!
tSpeech!", Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes
tloud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the
tcrowd.  Joe observes from the fringe.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttt(to the guests)
ttI thought I was going to sneak away
tttonight...

tYELLS of "No!"  "Never!"

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
tt...What a glorious night, every
ttface I see is a memory.  It may not
ttbe a perfectly perfect memory --
ttsometimes we had our ups and downs
tt-- but we're all together, and
ttyou're mine for a night.
ttt(a moment)
tt-- And I'm going to break precedent,
ttand tell you my one-candle wish --
ttthat you would have a life as lucky
ttas mine, where you can wake up one
ttmorning and say "I don't want
ttanything more."
ttt(another moment)
ttSixty-five years - don't they go by
ttin a blink?

tParrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows
tinto CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune.  Quince
tgrabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back.  Now
tParrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they
thold each other close for a moment, but then are separated
tby a surge of guests.  Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but
tthere is a tinge of sadness about her.  He heads towards her,
tthey are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWhat a night.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI'm having a helluva time.

tA moment.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYou were right about Joe, he is
ttgoing somewhere --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttt(gently)
ttI'm sorry.

tSusan is examining Parrish very closely.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttAre you relieved?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYes, but --

tParrish hesitates.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttBut what?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI want you to know how much I love
ttyou.  That you've given a meaning
ttto my life that I had no right to
ttexpect, and that no one can ever
tttake from me.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttDaddy --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttNo -- I love you so much and I want
ttyou to promise me something.  I
ttdon't want you to ever worry about
ttme.  If anything should happen, I'm
ttgoing to be fine and everything's
ttgoing to be all right.
ttt(a moment)
tt-- And I have no regrets.

tSusan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttAnd I want you to feel that way,
tttoo.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI love you, Daddy --

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThat's why it's okay.

tThey drift into silence.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttNo regrets?

tAfter a moment.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>tt'No regrets'.

tA long silence, Susan smiles.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttIt's a good feeling, isn't it?

tSilence again.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttEverybody's saying goodbye...

tThey regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an
tunderstanding.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI'm still here.
ttt(a moment)
ttWould you like to dance with me,
ttSusan?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttOh, yes --

tHe starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttIf you don't mind dancing with an
ttold fogey like me.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttOh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll
ttnever be old.

tHe takes her in his arms and they dance away.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tOn a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still
tcommands a view of the dance floor, is Joe.  His eyes are on
tParrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully.
tA Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops.

<b>ttt     WAITER
</b>ttCan I get you anything, sir?

tJoe regards the Waiter for a moment.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttDo you have any peanut butter?

tThe Waiter hesitates.

<b>ttt     WAITER
</b>ttI don't think so, sir.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttThank you, anyway.

tThe Waiter moves off.  Joe's attention returns to Parrish and
tSusan, the dance number ends, a BOOM.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tOn the dance floor.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttWhat was that?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttThe fireworks are about to start.

tParrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttt(to Parrish)
ttShall we?

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttYou go ahead, honey, I'm going to
ttcatch my breath.

tSuddenly he hugs her, holds her very close.  She looks at
thim, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she
tsmiles back.  Now she heads out with the crowd for the
tfireworks.  When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns
tand heads up towards Joe.

tJoe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttHappy Birthday, Bill.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThank you.

tThey watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks.
tJoe's gaze lingers.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttDid you say goodbye?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttNot exactly.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI guess you have your reasons.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYes.

tSilence.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttNow that we have a moment, would you
ttmind if I expressed my gratitude for
ttwhat you did for Susan?

tJoe waits.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttI never heard her speak of any man
ttas she spoke of you -- It was always
ttwhat I wanted for her -- but what
tthappens to her now?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI wouldn't worry about it, Bill.
ttThese things have a way of working
ttout.

tJoe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish
thas accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues:

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttAnd would you mind if I expressed my
ttgratitude...?

tParrish waits.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
ttFor you.  For the time you've given
ttme.  For the person you are.

tA moment.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttDon't blow smoke up my ass, you'll
ttruin my autopsy.

tJoe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the
tcrowd below, searching.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttIt's hard to let go, isn't it?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttThat's life.  What can I tell you?

tA silence, an understanding there is another more to say.
tJoe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say "Shall we?",
tParrish nods and Joe turns with him.  They set off now away
tfrom the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking
tthe river.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tDown below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial
tfireworks display.  Among them is Susan, but her interest
tisn't there.  Not something pulls her attention, an over-
tpowering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a
tdistance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.  Some-
tthing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens
ther, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the
tfireworks.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tUp the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him.

<b>ttt     PARRISH
</b>ttI'm getting a little dizzy, I can
ttfeel my heart pumping --

tBut Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on
tup the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step
twith him.

ttt     PARRISH (cont'd)
ttShould I be afraid?

tJoe stops, Parrish stops with him.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttNot a man like you.

tParrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides
tout again, Joe right with him.  In tandem they continue
ton and disappear over the crest of the hill.  A barrage
tof fireworks lights up the sky.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tDown below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks
tup towards the hill.  There is nobody there.  She hesitates,
tnow glides away from the party, her step quickens as she
twalks up towards the hill.

tSusan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from
tover the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared.
tHe is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out,
tseems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if
tpulled by a magnet.  Now she stops again.  It is a man, he
tkeeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttJoe...?

tHe smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right
tin front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so
tappealing.  They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet
tclose.

ttt     SUSAN (cont'd)
ttYou're here...

tHe is trying to get his bearings.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>tt-- You bet.

tSomething about him makes Susan slightly tentative.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWhere did you go?

tJoe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of
ttime and place.

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttI don't know -- y'know, I don't know
tt-- it's all blurred up and hazy.  And
ttwould y'know what I mean if I said I
ttdon't think it's worth figuring out?

tSome realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her
tlightheaded.

ttt     JOE (cont'd)
tt...But now I'm back.

tSusan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an
tanswer.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttt(gently)
ttThat's it?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttWell, I don't know what else to say.
ttIt's a helluva party --

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttYou think so?

<b>ttt     JOE
</b>ttYeah...and you're the prettier
ttthing here.

tSusan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his
tjacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she
tregards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling
twith the last moments fades away.

tSusan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken,
ta sudden intake of breath.

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttHey, you all right?

tHis hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her
tsupport.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttThe coffee shop --

tThe Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttI asked you if I said something
ttwrong and you said it was so right
ttit scared you.

tSusan holds herself very still.

ttt     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
ttAnd forgive me for saying this --
ttbut then you said -- and it's been
ttwith me ever since --

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttWhat has --?

tHe hesitates.

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttYou said you liked me.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttNo --

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttY'didn't?

tA moment.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI said I liked you so much.

tShe falls silent now, overcome by the last moments'
trevelations.  The Young Man senses her discomfort which
tis on the edge of pain.

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttHey, everything's going great --
ttdon't y'think?

tShe doesn't answer for a moment.

ttt     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
ttDon't you feel that way?

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>tt...We know so little about each
ttother.

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttBut we've got time.

tShe searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open,
tcompletely vulnerable, waiting for her response.  A long
tsilence, the words come out haltingly:

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>ttI wish you could've known my
ttfather...

tAnother moment.

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttMe, too.

tSusan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are
tcompletely intent on each other.

<b>ttt     SUSAN
</b>tt...What do we do now?

tA long silence.

<b>ttt     YOUNG MAN
</b>ttIt will come to us.

tSusan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes
tup from below, the night fills with light.  The Young Man
tsearches Susan's face, now takes her hand -- and together
tthey start back towards the party.

<b>tTHE END
