tA smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like
twatchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and
ta half million people a day.

<b>tEXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY
</b>
tTHE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side. 

tHU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET
tVENDOR across the street.

tShe pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
tbite we see:

<b>tTHE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER
</b>
tTWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball
terupting over one side of the embassy.

tPeople panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes
ta bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned
tstreet vendor.

ttSomeone better call the police.

<b>tEXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tThe passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in
ta Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English
tdictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
tlook to two girls in a convertible.

</b>ttt(int Chinese)
ttDeng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.

tThe HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who
tis driving and singing to his radio.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttt(singing)
tt...wish they all could be California...
ttwish they all could be California
ttgirls...

tCarter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it
tout of the SUNROOF.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttI warned you about playing that shit
ttwhen I'm in the car.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttThat was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a
ttChinese man's CD.

</b>ttDid you see the way those girls drove
ttoff?  I did you a favor.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttThose girls drove off because of you.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttAll I did was invite them for a drink.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttYou invited them to get naked and
ttsacrifice a small goat.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttt(checking Chinese-English
ttt dictionary)
ttI said that?  Which word was "goat?"

tLee picks up his CD case.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttYou owe me a copy of the Beach Boys
ttGreatest Hits, Volume Two.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttDon't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've
ttbeen here three days and we haven't done
ttshit.  We haven't been to a club,
tthaven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on

</b>ttNot Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some

tCarter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over

</b>
<b>tINT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.

<b>ttttSUPERINDENDENT CHIN
</b>ttLee, there was a bombing at the American
ttEmbassy.  Two American translators were
ttkilled.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttAny leads?

<b>ttttSUPERINDENDENT CHIN
</b>ttt(beat)
ttWe think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't
ttwant to take the case, I'll understand.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttIt's my responsibility.

tLee hangs up the cell phone.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttWhat was that?  Did you just pick up a
ttcase?  Did we just take another damn
ttcase on my vacation?

tLee smiles at Carter.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttOf course not.  My Superindendent
ttinvited us to a club tonight.  Big
ttparty.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttDon't be messing with me, Lee.  I will

</b>ttCarter, would I lie to you?

</b><b>tttEXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tCarter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their
tway to the door of the Raven Club.  Carter is combing his
thair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping
twhen he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttThat's what I'm talking about.  A real
ttHong Kong night club.  You want an
ttAltoid?

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttYou better take one.  Your breath has
ttbeen a little funky all day.  Let me
ttlook at you.

tCarter looks at Lee.  Fixes his collar.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttJust relax and don't worry about a

ttgot condoms?

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttNo.  

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttTake this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold
ttit in half.

tCarter dances through the door, Lee follows.

<b>tINT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tA dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL
tGIRLS and CIVILIANS.  Lee and Carter walk in.  Lee is trying
tto keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where
ta man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael
tJackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttI'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. 
ttThey don't like tourists in here, so try
ttto blend in.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttBlend in?  I'm two feet taller than
tteveryone here.  Where you going?

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttBathroom.

tLee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to
tthe bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttHow you boys doing tonight?

tThe thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the
tOLD MAN continues to sing.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttThat is the worst singing I've ever
ttheard.  That sounds like something you'd
tthear in prison after lights out.

tThe thugs continue to ignore Carter.

<b>tINT. RAVEN CLUB - BACK HALL - NIGHT
</b>
tLee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open
tdoor - sees a private room.  Several TRIADS are using hi-tech
tMACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

<b>ttttCARTER (V.O.)
</b>ttGet closer to my body now.  And just
ttlove me, till you don't know how...

tLee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he
trealizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL
<b>tYOU GET ENOUGH."
</b>
<b>tINT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tA room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open,
twatching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael
tJackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a
tfew of the smitten women who are watching him.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttt(whispering from side of stage)
ttCarter, get off that stage!

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttAre you kidding, they love me.  I'm a
ttstar, Lee.  A god to these people!

tCarter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to
tthe EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttThis is a gangster bar, we're here
ttundercover.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttI knew you were lying.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttI'm sorry.

</b>ttDamn it, why are you ruining my night? 
ttI'm just starting to have fun.
ttt(beat)
ttWell fine then, go ahead, pull your
ttbadge and do your thing.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttNo, we're here for information, to find
ttout where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We
ttmust tread softly and keep our ears
ttopen.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttTread softly?  Who taught you how to
ttroost a bar?

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttCarter, you don't understand.  These men
ttare Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the
ttmost deadly gang in China.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttMan, are you crazy?  You think that
ttscares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented
ttgangs.  We were having gang wars before
ttanybody even thought about it.  We get
ttroyalties from other gangs.  Now gimme
ttyour badge and gun and I'll show you how
ttit's done.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttNo.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am
ttMichael Jackson, and you are Toto.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttYou mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner
ttlast night.

tBefore Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. 
tCarter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
tfires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(Chinese)
ttDeng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang
ttlui.

tNobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to
tLee.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttWhat'd I say?

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttYou just said you're their worst
ttnightmare - and to line their mothers up
ttfor a milking.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttShit.  C'mon, get up here and help me
ttout.

tReluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese
tas Carter speaks, Lee translating.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttOkay, all the Triads and ugly women go
ttto that side, all fine ass women on this
ttside.

tNobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttLet's try this again.  Who here knows
ttRicky Tan, raise your hand.

tNobody moves.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttWho here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.

tNobody moves.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttNow I know you're lying.  

tThe crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee
tspots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage --

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(as they run out)
ttI come back and catch y'all singing
ttMichael Jackson and you're all going to
ttjail.

<b>tEXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tLee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI
tand several gangsters round a corner.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttStop!  LAPD!

tLee takes off and chases them on foot.

<b>tEXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tEXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tThe far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS.  The
tGANGSTERS look around frantically.  An apartment building is
tunder CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom. 
tTheir only way out is UP.

tLee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
tSWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.  Lee wastes no time going after
tthem.  With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
tVAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttHang on, Lee.  I'm coming.

tCarter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN
tCLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

tABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the
tLENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood
tagainst wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his
tpole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.

tBELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
tto pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the
tbar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...

tWHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
tCARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttForget this...

tHe dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
tcome at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
tSEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS
tthem with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs
tafter the GANGSTER LEADER.

tON HU LI and the GANGSTERS

tComing over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up
tthe hill.

<b>tEXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tLee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
tWHAM!  He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE.  Lee TOPPLES
tOVER THE EDGE!  We see his adversary for the first time.

<b>tHU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS
</b>
tAs she steps to the edge... BOOM!  The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES
tOPEN and CARTER EMERGES.  Gun low and ready.  Hu Li is gone.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttt(out of breath)
ttFreeze!  Nobody move!

tCarter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. 
tCarter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

tShe takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
tand WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
<b>tROOF!
</b>
tHe falls along the side of the building.  He manages to grab
tthe end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.

<b>tLEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!
</b>
tThey're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu
tLi looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off. 
tShe turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

<b>tCARTER AND LEE
</b>
tholding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting
tto bend.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttAll I wanted was a little mu-shu.

tCarter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.

</b>ttYou lied to me. 

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttI'm sorry.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttYou're sorry.  I got somebody's old

tMASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.

tThe kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from
tshadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
tHOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around
tto face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
tflying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of

</b>ttI know you, Detective Carter, right? 
ttYou're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying

</b>ttI'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm --
ttand don't let the robe fool you.  This

tTan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP
tfrom Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT
tagainst the wall.  Ricky glances at his men who are seated
taround the room waiting to move.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttI told you to get on your feet!

tHaving heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side,
tbreathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttLee, I've missed you, brother.
ttt(getting up, giving Lee a hug)
ttI heard about the two Americans, I'm so
ttsorry, you must be under great pressure.

</b>ttYou must come with me for questioning.

</b>ttLet's go.  I've got girls and chicken
ttand hot oil waiting for me.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttI don't think so...

tA nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and
ttowels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing
tLee and Carter.  A beat...

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttI'd like to pay you for that laptop.

</b>ttIt's no problem.  But I must excuse
ttmyself, inspector.

</b>ttThat's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

tTan bows to Lee and Carter.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttCongratulations.  And good day.

tAs Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. 
tBut they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.

tLee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man
tcovers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other
thenchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
ttowel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
tblocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
tthe while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
this robe, or some other found object.

tCarter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
tflying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttt(ref: his privates)
ttDamn!  No wonder you're pissed off.

tCarter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of
tthe men's punches.

tIn the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he
tflinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. 
tMomentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men
tthrowing him out the front door.

tCarter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over
ttheir shoulders.

tbut to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the
tside of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.  He
tclings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging
tLIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --

tAs Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
tfrom a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner 
t- almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN
tREIGN.  Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
timpeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
tmoney. 
tHe's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,
tReign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
tas sociopath.

tCarter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li.  Carter
thides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room
tfor signs of trouble.  He heads into the main party.

tHu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.

tRicky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.  Hu Li
tscreams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.  Tan
tfalls back, over the rail, and into the water.

tLee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee,
tattacking from all sides.  Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight
toff the bodyguards.

tHu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and
tsuddenly goes FLYING, landing flat on her face.

tIt's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED
tHu Li with his leg.

tHu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head.

this breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines.

tCarter turns his head, sees --

t-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li
tescape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should
tduring a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears

tLee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the
twalls and tries to make his way to the soft count room.

tHe hears noise, TWO SECURITY GUARDS coming behind him through
tthe casino door.  He has no choice but to crawl over the back
tof a money cart and hug the top.  He lies as still as he can,
ttrying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring
tdirectly into the EYE IN THE SKY cameras that are in the
tceiling.

<b>tWE SEE LEE'S FACE
</b>
tas he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the
twords "oh shit" as he rolls by.

tLee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain
tof COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out. 
tOn the opposite side, the REAL MONEY is being WHEELED OUT
ttoward a waiting TRUCK that is parked at the back door.

tLee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is
tblown.  He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of
tthe locked vault.  There's no way to get the plates. 
tIsabella has set him up again.

tHe turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttHi.  How's it going?  You guys have
ttchange for a twenty?

tThe GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them
tdown the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO
tMORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward
tthe casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a
tright cross.

tHu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she
tstands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife
tto Lee's throat.

<b>ttttHU LI
</b>ttt(in Chinese)
ttOpen your mouth.

tShe puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. 
tShe holds the detonator in her hand.

trolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him.

tAFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.

tYOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.

</b>ttHey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady
ttblows on my hand for luck?

<b>ttttTEXAN
</b>ttHey, buddy, watch yourself.

tThe elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the

tthe room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room.

<b>tINT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tFORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel.  A MAN
tstands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the
tcasino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.

tLee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind
this back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttImagine a business where people hand you
ttmoney.  And you hand them back
ttabsolutely nothing.

tRicky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. 
tIsabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the
tsight of Ricky Tan alive.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN (CONT'D)
</b>ttNow that's a true American dream. 
ttThanks to a few pieces of metal and a
ttvery greed driven US Customs agent.

tRicky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN (CONT'D)
</b>ttLook at you, you're ridiculous.  You
ttknow it didn't have to be like this. 
ttBut it's too bad!  Like father, like

tLee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of
tthe monitors.

<b>ttttHU LI

ttHe's going for the plates.

tRicky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign
twalking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE
<b>tSUITE.
</b>
<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttLook at this old fool, what does he
ttthink he's doing?

tRicky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt's almost impossible to find a partner
ttthat's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't
ttyou agree, Lee?

<b>tON ANOTHER SCREEN
</b>
tWe see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life. 
tRicky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to
tIsabella as he goes.

</b>ttSir, we'd like to escort you to the

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttThat would be great.  Don't want any of

tplays with the button.

<b>ttttHU LI
</b>ttt(in Chinese)
ttIn a few minutes...you'll beg me to push
ttthis button.

tHu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee.  She holds the
tblade to his face.  About to cut him.  When Isabella pulls
ther gun.

tIsabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind
this back.  Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her
tknife in the other.  She takes a step toward Isabella.

<b>ttttISABELLA
</b>ttIt's time to end this, Inspector.

tIsabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator
tfrom Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and
tsticking the gun under her chin.

<b>ttttISABELLA (CONT'D)
</b>ttDon't move!  United States Secret
ttService.

tHu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the
thand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator --
tthe TWO WOMEN fight around it.

tLee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and
trolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when:

<b>tTHE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR
</b>
tThey're about to move in.

<b>ttttHU LI
</b>ttGet the detonator!

tThe Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet,
tKICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her.

tOne of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee
tgets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his
tback.

tHu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM.

tLee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.

tTwo security guards lead Carter away from the table when:

</b>
tAn AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. 
tIn a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.

tThe NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttLee!!

tThe guards restrain him.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttLemme ask you something.  Any of you
ttever felt $500,000 before?

tHe SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying
tas the GUARDS hit the floor.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttDoesn't feel so good, does it?

<b>tINT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

<b>tINT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

tOn his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND
tDISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before
tLee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the
tdetonator on her rounds.

tPanicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a
tBLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it,
tbut he does see:

<b>tACROSS THE CASINO
</b>
tCarter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at
tbay with a croupier stick.

tCarter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. 
tBut from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way
tis the HIGH WAY.

tLee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards. 
tReaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. 
tHe launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --
tlanding on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other
tside.

tCarter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in
tthe Sky Room.  He grins.

<b>ttttCARTER

tto get to it first.

tA security guard CLIMBS on the table to level Carter when Lee

tplea MUFFLED.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttWhat the HELL are you doing with tape on

tNo time to explain -- two more security guards arrive.  Kicks
tand punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!  He bobs
tand weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in
tbetween swings.  Suddenly:

tBLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.

tEveryone HITS THE DECK.  Carter and Lee dive on to the floor
tas panic ripples through the Casino.  People FLEE for the

</b>
tTHE WAITRESS DESERTS HER TRAY.  It gets knocked over and TIPS
ton the floor.  The DETONATOR LANDS feet away from Carter.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttThis can't be good.

tLee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it!  A
thigh heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.  He LUNGES for
tit, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --

tWHAM!  He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY.  The second it hits
tthe floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.

tABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room.  Hu Li
tSTEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.  

tThe DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li.  As she bends to PICK
tup the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time. 
tHorrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.

tHu Li lifts the detonator.

tCarter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.

tCarter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee. 
tBut halfway up the carpet.  Carter stops.  Lee turns to see

tSteven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of
tHUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a
tblack bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he
tcomes face-to-face with Ricky Tan.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttAmerican's love to gamble.  Don't they,
ttMr. Reign?

<b>ttttSTEVEN REIGN
</b>ttI'm cutting our deal short.  I'm
ttleaving.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttAnd my plates?

<b>ttttSTEVEN REIGN
</b>ttThey stay with me.  I'm sure you won't
tthave a problem with that.

tReign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and
tstarts to walk toward the door.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttI enjoyed that little story you told
ttabout the Dragon and the treasure.  My
ttmother used to tell it to me all the
tttime.  Do you know the moral of that
ttstory, Mr. Reign?

<b>ttttSTEVEN REIGN
</b>ttGreed will imprison us all.

tTan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttI hate that fortune cookie shit.

tLee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls
tdead to the floor.  Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttPut the plates down.

tRicky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.

<b>tINT. CASINO - NIGHT

tWHOOSH!  Another Terra Cotta fighting stick is in half in
tCarter's hands.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttWill you STOP?!?!
ttt(picks up cocktail umbrella)
ttWhat am I supposed to fight you with?

tNo more toying.  Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE
tWHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD.  She SLICES it in HALF!  He's
tgot nowhere to hide.

tShe JABS him with the sword.  Carter SCREAMS.  Falls back
tagainst the table, clutching his chest.  Hu Li WINDMILLS,
tkicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --

<b>tTHWACK!
</b>
tThe DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and
tshe is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade.  Staring
tat Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.

tCarter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS
tHER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhen are you people gonna learn?  Don't
ttmess with the brothas!

tWEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He
treaches through the slice in his jacket.  Instead of a hand
tcovered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!

<b>ttttCARTER (CONT'D)
</b>ttThank you, Benjamin!

tCarter runs for the elevator.

tLee is walking toward Ricky Tan, the two men circling Reign's
tbody.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttYou're just like your father, Lee.  All
ttthese years hiding behind his badge.  I
ttwanted to help him, to share with him,
ttbut he was too afraid of change.  When
ttyou think about it, I didn't really kill
tthim.  I just put him out of his misery.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttPut the plates down.  It's over.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttI don't think it's over.  There are
ttcasinos all over this country.  Let me
ttmake you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make
ttthe same mistake he did.

tRicky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttIf you reach for that gun, I'm going to
ttkill you.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttDon't you remember?  I'm already dead.

tRicky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,
ttaking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as
tCarter bursts in the room.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttHey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's
ttup, Lee?

tLee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him
tlike this before.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttWould you like me to tell you how your
ttfather died?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttLee, you okay?

tLee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttHe never begged for his life.  Or tried
ttto make a deal.  All that he asked me,
ttjust seconds before I pulled the
tttrigger, was that I promise not to kill
ttyou.

tLee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the
ttrigger but can't.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttLee, wait a second.  It's not worth it,
ttman.  He's making you do this.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttIt's worth it to me.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttDo you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you
ttgonna spend the rest of your life hiding
ttlike your father?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttC'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You
ttwon, now just put the gun down.

tLee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.

<b>ttttRICKY TAN
</b>ttThat's what I thought.

tTan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the
tplates hit him across the face and knock him down.

<b>tTHE GUN IS LOOSE
</b>
tTan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:

tLee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM
<b>tSQUARE IN THE CHEST.
</b>
tTan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Lee tries to
tgrab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.

tBut Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the
tstreet below.

<b>tEXT. STREET - NIGHT

tA TAXI is parked out front.  Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof.

tLee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved
tit's finally over.  Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttI don't know about you, but I need a
ttwine cooler.

tAs they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them,
tbleeding and half-dead.  She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. 
tThis one twice the size of the one from earlier.

<b>ttttHU LI
</b>ttt(in Chinese)
ttWe'll go together, Inspector.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttPlease tell me she just asked for a ride
ttto the airport.

tHu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn
tand RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.

tLee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the

tThe FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side
tof the hotel.

</b>
tLee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER. 
tThey flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE

</b>
tIt's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.

tLee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.  A HUGE
tTRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. 
tThe entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttI can't believe I flew ten-thousand
ttmiles for this shit!!

tThey lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips
tand they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE

tLee and Carter land in the back.  Slam into their seats and
ttry to catch their breath.  The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH
twhen they realize they're alive!

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttWe made it, man.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttNo problem.

tLee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR
tOF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at
tthem.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a
tnight on the town.

<b>ttttVERSACE SALESMAN
</b>ttWell, there is a God after all.

tLee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of
tthe hotel.

</b>ttHere we are.  The Red Dragon hotel.

tIn front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE

tLee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with
tSterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  Lee and
tIsabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane,
tLee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttI saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? 
ttYou played it cool, though.  Walking
ttaway, never looking back.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttShe's going home to New York.  I need
ttsome ice.

tLee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttThat your gate down there?

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttI'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttI guess so.  Thank you, Carter.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttYou take care of yourself, Lee.

tCarter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND
tlike a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttCarter, wait.  There's something I want
ttyou to have.

tLee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttYour father's badge?  No way, man.  I
ttcan't take this.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttIt's okay.  I can finally let it go.

tCarter takes the badge.  Smiles.

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttIn that case, I got something for you. 
ttI picked it up at the hotel.

tCarter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttWhat is this?

<b>ttttCARTER
</b>ttAbout fifty grand.  I won it at the
tttables.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttNo, Carter.  I can't take this.

</b>ttIt's okay, I got lots more.

tCarter pulls out another wad of cash.

</b>ttThey owe us, man.  That's the least they
ttcan do.

<b>ttttLEE
</b>ttThis money is evidence.

</b>ttCome on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five
ttminutes and live it up.  There must be
ttsomething you want.

tLee looks back toward Isabella.

</b>ttI always wanted to go to Madison Square
ttGarden.  See the Knicks play.

</b>ttI could use a little vacation.

</b>ttAmen to that, brother.

tAs Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC
tSWELLS.  "WAR" starts to PLAY.  They dance their way through
ta crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make
ttheir way through the airport.
