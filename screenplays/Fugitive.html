</b>
<b>tCREDITS BEGIN OVER:
</b>
tSnow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago.

<b>tEXT. CHICAGO HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
tCars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN 
tin tuxedo moves into:

<b>tINT. CHICAGO HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tTHROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs 
tto the ballroom.

<b>tANGLE - COAT CHECK
</b>
tThe Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her. 
tWhen he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, 
ta tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

tHe moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated 
tballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical
tfundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and 
tsponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the 
tmodels. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

tA banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND 
<b>tAID FOUNDATION"
</b>
tKimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly 
tsets on another waiter's passing tray.

<b>ttttROBERTS (V.O.)
</b>ttRichard...

tDR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group
tof surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars.

ttinto it...

tA hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks.

<b>ttttKIMBLE 
</b>ttSo, what's the deal? If the hospital

</b>ttNo, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. 
ttKimble. Industrial Hospital Supply 
tthas no ulterior motives.

</b>ttOn the house, huh?
ttt(to bartender)
ttTonic water with lime.

tEveryone agrees.

<b>ttttKIMBLE 
</b>ttNever get me to sell my soul for one
ttof those trips...

tHis tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttt(to Nat)
t t... But if you get any more Bulls 
tttickets, Nat, give me a call.

tThe group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS

</b>
<b>tCUT TO:

</b>
tMoving through the crowd.

<b>ttttGOLFING MAN 
</b>ttThanks, Richard...

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tANGLE - TOUGH-LOOKING LAB RAT
</b>
tKATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal 
telegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over 
tT-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway.

<b>ttttDR. WAHLUND 
</b>ttt(dripping sarcasm)
ttI'm so glad you talked me into 
ttcoming, Richard... I can pick my
ttcruise wardrobe.

<b>ttttRICHARD 
</b>ttIt's for a good cause, Kath... 
ttBesides you need to get out of the

tShe smiles. He moves on.

<b>tANGLE - PARTY
</b>
tKimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend...

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttHey, Jim.

tDR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the 
tUniversity Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.

<b>ttttNICHOLS
</b>ttRichard, I just saw someone who 
ttwanted to meet you...

tJust then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, 
twearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by
ta group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble 
tcatch a look and hold it.

<b>ttttNICHOLS (V.O.)
</b>ttRichard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex
ttis working on the RDU90 trials for 
ttDevlin-Macgregor.

tKimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, 
tsmiling. Lentz extends his hand...

<b>ttttLENTZ
</b>ttDr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been 
tttrading phone calls last few days 
tt... something about a biopsy report 
ttI returned to you?

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttt(suddenly attentive)
ttYeah... Three. Livers appeared 
tthepatetic to me.

<b>ttttLENTZ
</b>ttI'll be in my office in the morning 
ttand I'll pull up the samples. Is that 
tta good time for you?

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttSure.

<b>ttttLENTZ
</b>ttt(holds Kimble's look, 
tttthen to Nichols)
ttSee you, Jim.

tLentz moves on. Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses 
ton relocating the Woman he just saw. She's gone. He and 
tNichols move together through the party.

<b>ttttNICHOLS
</b>ttt(digs in his pocket)
ttBefore I forget, I went by the garage
ttthis afternoon and picket up the 
ttFerrari. Thanks for the loaner again.

tHe hands Kimble a valet ticket.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttThey fix it this time?

<b>ttttNICHOLS
</b>ttWe'll see.

tThey reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife, HELEN KIMBLE. 
tKimble kisses her.

<b>ttttNICHOLS
</b>ttYou look fabulous, Helen.

tHe kisses Helen.

<b>ttttHELEN (WOMAN)
</b>ttHello, Jim.

<b>ttttNICHOLS
</b>ttt(to Kimble)
ttWe've got a court tomorrow at three.

tNichols leaves. Kimble looks at his wife.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttWell, I've seen everyone, can we 
ttleave?

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttThat would be a little abrupt, don't 
ttyou think?

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT
</b>
tA table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to 
tothers at table ant sit across from each other.

tKimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, 
tmid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other 
<b>tOLDER WIFE.
</b>
tHelen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress 
ther with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS 
<b>tCONTINUE...
</b>
tINTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course 
tchanges, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange 
tof glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, 
tcatches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to 
this watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly 
tready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper 
tof their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: 
t"not yet."

tAs we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

t"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod 
tat Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." 
t"That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress 
tyou're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 
t'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

tKimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his 
twatch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes 
ther head.

<b>ttttNOW EAU WIFE
</b>ttt(to table)
ttI told my husband that he was going 
ttto kill us if he didn't stop 
ttoperating. What with this AIDS thing, 
tthe's putting us all at risk.

tHelen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share 
ta look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(to her dinner partners)
ttI'm sorry, I have to get my husband 
tthome.

tThey say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols 
tshakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we 
tsee Lentz watching.

<b>tINT. KIMBLE'S MERCEDES - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through 
this hair as he drives.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttYou looked handsome tonight...

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttThank you...

tHe smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much 
tfor Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttUh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look 
ttlike waiters...

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttBut me?

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttYou looked more like... a band 
ttdirector.

tHe stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light 
tchanges and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttAre we home yet?...

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble pulls up in front of his house. Suddenly both his

ttDr. Kimble
ttt(suddenly attentive)
ttWhen? Okay, tell them I'll be there 
ttin ten minutes.

tHe hangs up.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttTim's got a problem.

tHelen kisses him again, opens the door.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttCall me on your way home.

tCREDITS END as we -

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY / SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble, wearing scrubs but without head gear, moves down 
tstairs to the OR hall.

tHe sticks his head into the operating room.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttCavalry's here.

tTwo harried surgeons look up, glad to see him.

<b>tSCRUB ROOM
</b>
tKimble begins scrubbing as the RESIDENT comes out to bring 
thim up to speed.

<b>ttttRESIDENT
</b>ttPatient is a male, forty-three. We 
ttpulled his gall bladder and the 
ttbleeding started.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttWhat's his pro time?

ttHe's at 36 seconds. We got a major 
ttbleeder in here.

</b>ttNone. He's off the street.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>

<b>tINT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tOperation in progress. Top medical facility filled with 
ttrained professionals and state of the art equipment. Kimble 
tis assisted across the table by the chief Resident. Both 
tworking so intently they never look at each other as they 
ttalk...

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttt(to Anesthesiologist)
ttOkay... I'm clamping. Can he 
tttolerate it?

</b>ttDo we have a choice?

<b>ttttANESTHESIOLOGIST
</b>ttGo for it.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttMarie, give me a clamp...

tMARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble 
tand the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident 
tassisting.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttt(never looking up)
ttYour husband know you're here tonight,
ttMarie?... What about this liver?

<b>ttttRESIDENT
</b>ttHistory's sketchy. Could be an 
ttalcoholic.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttWho referred him?

<b>ttttRESIDENT
</b>ttHe's on a drug protocol. RDU90.

tKimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident 
tover their masks, then back to work.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttThe wave of the future... Marie, you 
tttold Frank yet? Frank is so jealous 
ttof this late night thing we've got 
ttgoing here... This should hold him. 
ttBleeding's stopped. Let's get a

ttt(to circulating nurse)
ttSend it downstairs and make sure you

tKimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown.

tKimble throws away his hat and mask. The door opens behind

<b>ttttSURGEON
</b>ttThanks.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble driving through empty Chicago streets toward home. 
tHe is on phone, waits for answer.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttHi. I'm five minutes away...

<b>tINTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>tINT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tHelen on the phone, downstairs. She is still in her gown with 
tan afghan around her shoulders. She's been reading.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI'm glad it went well. I'll see you 
ttin a minute.

tHelen hangs up phone, turns out the light and starts up the 
tstairs.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble driving.

<b>tINT. KIMBLE-S TOWNHOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tHelen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet.

tOpens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on 
tthe light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close 
tone of the interior closet doors.

tShe starts to slide the door closed when - wham!

tA hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen 
tclaws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her 
tstring of pearls bursts...

t... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls 
tacross the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from 
tthe top.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tSnow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the 
tdriveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still 
ton.

<b>tINT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tA GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on 
tthe entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and 
tcalls up the stairs.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttI'm home. Did you hear who won the 
ttBulls game?

tNo answer. He steps into the:

<b>tKITCHEN
</b>
tThe wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The 
tWASHER BUZZES, he switches the clothes from washer to dryer,
tand STARTS the MACHINE. Takes a bottle of wine and two 
tglassesand leaves the kitchen.

<b>tINT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON .38 SMITH AND WESSON - NIGHT
</b>
tLies on the floor, beside Helen's legs and the receiver of 
tphone, off the hook. A man's rubber-gloved hand picks up the 
tgun.

<b>tINTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>tINT. DOWNSTAIRS - STAIRS - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble starts up the stairs to the bedroom...

<b>tINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tHelen's hand reaches out presses the cradle down, dials

<b>tON KIMBLE
</b>
tClimbing the stairs... suddenly stops.

tA small white ball on the stairs. He bends down and picks 
tit up... a pearl.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttHelen?

tSilence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet. 
tToo quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor.

<b>tUPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before 
the enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. 
tAdrenal surge.

tKimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun 
tfree. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. 
tThe attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a 
tleg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, 
tsending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the 
tlanding and over the edge - three flights to the entry 
thall below.

tSIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

tThe man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble 
tcatches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his
tshock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

tKimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. 
tElectrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable 
tface...

tThe SIRENS are LOUDER...

tBefore Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble 
tdown and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

tKimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped 
tby a VOICE behind him in the bedroom...

<b>ttttHELEN (O.S.)
</b>ttHe's here... still in the house...

<b>tINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tLying by the bed, Helen Kimble, clutches the phone with one 
thand, her head with the other.

<b>tttt911 (V.O.)
</b>ttDid I hear you right? Your attacker 
ttis still in the house? Ma'am?

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttHe's trying to kill me...

tKimble appears. Helen drops the phone when she sees him.

<b>tttt911 (V.O.)
</b>ttWill you repeat that please?

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttt(to Kimble)
ttRichard... He's trying to kill me... 
ttmy head.


<b>tEXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tTwo Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly 
tto the house.

<b>tINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble moves to her. Sees the necklace of bruises where she 
twas held down and choked. And then a bullet wound in her 
tleg. She's already going into shock. Her speech turns thick.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttHang on, babe... going to be all 
ttright.

tHer fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttMy head. Richard my hold me.

tHer eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her 
thead - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes 
tshe won't be all right.

tCAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone.

<b>tttt911 (V.O.)

ttRichard? Ma'am, can you talk to me? 
ttMa'am?

<b>tCUT TO:

</b>
tThe Cops enter the house. See the .38 lying on the floor. 
tCovering each other, they move quickly up the stairs - guns 
tdrawn.

tThird floor. The First Cop, gun drawn, turns the corner of 
tKimble's bedroom and finds:

tKimble holding his dead wife. Blood on his hands.

tjacket, and another hands him a parka.

<b>tEXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious 
tneighbors, television news vans, etc.

tKimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van 
tarrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)
</b>ttCan you give us a little more to go

ttartificial arm? What kind of gun was
ttit, Doc?

tCAMERA FINDS Kimble in an interview room. He is in "why" 
tshock. "Why her." "Why me?" Says nothing. Two Detectives: 
tKELLY and ROSETTI. Kelly, the questioner, is overweight, 
taggressive. He shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttIt was .38... I think. I only saw it 
ttfor a second. I knocked it out of 
tthis hand.

tAs Kimble is questioned we INTERCUT WITH flashes of the

tThey no longer seem on the same team.

</b>
tA few members lean over to make notes. It's powerful taken 
tout of context.

<b>tNICHOLS ON THE STAND
</b>
<b>ttttPROSECUTOR
</b>ttDr. Nichols. You are aware that 
ttRichard Kimble was the only 
ttbeneficiary of Helen Kimble's estate.
tt12 million dollars roughly.

<b>ttttNICHOLS
</b>ttI was aware of that. The money meant 
ttnothing to him.

<b>ttttPROSECUTOR
</b>ttYet in your presence, Richard Kimble 
ttonce said that 'if he had Helen's 
ttmoney he could find plenty of uses.'
ttDid he not?

<b>ttttNICHOLS
</b>ttWe were talking about -

<b>ttttPROSECUTOR
</b>ttYes or no?

tNichols' look tells us everything... Yes.

<b>tCORONER
</b>
tOn the stand.

<b>ttttCORONER
</b>ttThe wound to the head caused a 
ttmassive hemorrhage to the brain. It

tther to die...

tA woman in the jury reacts. Kimble notices.

<b>tKIMBLE
</b>
tOn the stand. He finishes his moving description of the 
tevents. We see some of the jury has been moved.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>tt... And I was holding her when the 
ttofficers came in.

tGutherie returns to his seat. The Prosecutor moves to the 
tjury. He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength.

<b>ttttPROSECUTOR
</b>ttHow tall was this man, Dr. Kimble?

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttI can't be sure. We were, mostly on 
ttthe floor, fighting... I couldn't -

<b>ttttPROSECUTOR
</b>ttDid that fight cause the scratches 
tton your face and arms?

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttNo. As I explained -

<b>ttttPROSECUTOR
</b>ttAnd how did this man enter your 
tthouse?

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttI don't know -

<b>ttttPROSECUTOR
</b>ttAnd you probably don't know why your

ttwere her attacker?

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttShe didn't -

<b>ttttPROSECUTOR
</b>ttYour name is Richard, isn't it? Your

tRichard Kimble sits behind the desk, but already he's a

</b>ttAfter careful and studied review of 
ttall evidence presented during each

ttbecause aggravated circumstances, 
ttdetailed at length, were present 
ttthe night of January 20th.

tKimble is silent, stunned, but all around him the sentence 
tshockwaves through the courtroom. Reporters push out rear 
tdoors. Prosecutors share a look - with a hangman's 
tsatisfaction. Nichols, watching behind Kimble's table, 
tlowers his head. Disbelief.

<b>tANGLE ON RICHARD KIMBLE
</b>
tHe remains silent. Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by 
tbailiff. Gutherie whispers an "I'm sorry." Kimble doesn't 
thear it.

</b>ttTherefore, it is the decision of

tLooks over his shoulder to the emptying courtroom. Faces

</b>tt... that you be remanded to Menard 
ttState penitentiary...

<b>tCLOSE ON CUFFS
</b>
tSlapped down over wrists, ratcheting down tight.

tAnkle cuffs dragged out. Pant legs raised, canvas shoes 
texposed. Cuffs clamped down on ankles.

tCHAINS RATTLED out. Snaked across the floor. Looped around

</b>
tThe four prisoners sit scattered, still cuffed but no longer 
tchained together. Near the front, PRISONER #1 is eyeing...

tThe two prison guards seated beyond the caged door. YOUNG 
tGUARD lighting a smoke. OLD GUARD drowsing. Shotguns

</b>
tPRISONER #1 rises. Through caging:

<b>ttttPRISONER #1
</b>ttHey. Illinois penal regulations 
ttrequire a meal for transport
ttrides of four hours or more.

tYoung Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." 
tChecks his watch: 4:00.

<b>ttttYOUNG GUARD
</b>ttJack! Feedin' time.

tOld Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his 
tbelt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker.

tPRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches 
tthe cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the 
taisle...

tPRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head 
tbetween his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and 
tCLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp 
tplastic shank.

tHeart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is 
thanding a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps 
ta look back to Copeland, who palms the shank.

<b>ttttCOPELAND
</b>ttBreathe, and you're first.

tOld Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun 
tcarelessly ready.

tYoung Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble 
tdoesn't respond.

<b>ttttYOUNG GUARD
</b>ttSuit yourself.

tHe offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, 
tsandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it.

tUp front, Old Guard yawns again just as...

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttLook out!

tToo late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into 
tYoung Guard's gut.

tPrisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes 
tout, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...

tJolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the 
tfloor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges 
tinside, but...

tPrisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... 
tOpening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under
tthe steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator.

tAs the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground.

tOld Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes 
toff target as...

tThe BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope
tand CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the 
tbottom of a small ravine.

<b>tINT. BUS - NIGHT
</b>
tENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down.

tOn his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds 
thim dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around 
tat...

tKimble. Rising between the seats.

tA hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things 
toff. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head.

tYoung Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to
tfind Kimble.

<b>ttttOLD GUARD
</b>ttt(to Kimble)
ttYou. You're a doctor. C'mere.

tHe slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a 
tmedical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

<b>ttttOLD GUARD
</b>ttDo something.

tKimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out 
this key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. 
tKimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just 
tBand-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttHe isn't going to make it unless he 
ttgets to a hospital. Fast.

<b>ttttOLD GUARD
</b><b>ttZL.
</b>
tIn this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it 
tjust settling?

tWith other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young 
tGuard's bleeding.

<b>tANGLE UNDER SEAT
</b>
tWe see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a 
tback window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the 
topening.

<b>tBACK TO KIMBLE
</b>
tA second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble 
tretracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a 
tgrowing vibration.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttJust where the hell are we?

tThe Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and
tlooks out one of the shattered, barred windows.

</b>
tThe bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend
tgrows bright by the light of an approaching train.

tto his side.

<b>tEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT
</b>
tDowntrack, one Cyclops light appears.

<b>tINT. BUS - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young 
tGuard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles 
tthe key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus.

tThe train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble 
tsnatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttWhich one? This? This one?!

tOld Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws 
tthe door open. Grabs Young Guard.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttHelp me get him -

tBut Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out 
tthe shattered windshield.

<b>tANGLE ON REAR OF BUS
</b>
tCopeland escapes through the hole in the back...

<b>tEXT. BUS - NIGHT
</b>
t... and hits the ground running the other way. The 
tlocomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.

<b>tINT. BUS - NIGHT
</b>
tTrain light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should 
tKimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard 
thold a look.

<b>tEXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT
</b>
tAs the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.

<b>tEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard 
tbehind him. He slings the man clear.

tSCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.

tFor one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.

tThe train light X-rays him.

tKimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint 
taway but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a 
tdozen mincing steps before...

tIMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, 
tsplitting it open.

tShrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his 
tfeet, still running feverish half-steps.

tAn EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its 
tflanks.

tThe train burns past the wounded Guard.

tKimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind 
thim. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:

tStill on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming 
tafter him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being 
tchased by a fire-breathing locomotive.

tThe train burrows to a stop.

tKimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval
tof earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that 
tnearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices
tsomething in his hand.

tIt's the key-ring.

<b>tEXT. WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
tKimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key. 
tSuddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.

<b>ttttCOPELAND (O.S.)
</b>ttGive me that.

tKimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his 
town chains.

<b>ttttCOPELAND
</b>ttYou listen to me. I don't give a 
ttdamn which way you go, just don't 
ttfollow me.

tKimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his 
tarm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the 
tother direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.

<b>tDISSOLVE TO:

tNews and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing 
tsmoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines 
those down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work 
tfeverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled 
twreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation 
tinvestigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted 
tremains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators.

tTwo American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. 
tmarshals emerge:

tBIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick 
tshithouse.

tRENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds 
tfully-equipped.

tPOOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttGood lord...

<b>ttttREFRO
</b>ttWhat is this... a circus?

tAs a group they begin moving along the service road above 
tthe crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below 
tthem. They take in the elements of the crash and as they 
twalk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.

tBiggs spots something...

ttCome on.

tThey drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain

</b>ttHow ya doing? Who's in charge?

<b>ttttTROOPER
</b>ttSheriff Rollins. Just follow the

tRenfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's 
tabout to happen.

<b>tANGLE - OLD GUARD
</b>
tSeated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his 
tshoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG 
tSHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote

tb.g., listening.

</b>tt... train was bearin' down on us,

</b>ttExcuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy

<b>ttttSHERIFF
</b>ttt(annoyed)
ttI'll be with you in a minute.

</b>ttt(to Old Guard)
ttFor the record. These three dead. 
ttAnd this one...

tHe switches to a photo of Kimble.

tHe slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. 
tJust as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's

</b>ttPlease, ladies and gentlemen, step

tmoving.

</b>
tKimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he 
tnears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. 
tHe's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison 
tjumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his 
tbreath.

tJust then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off 
tthe road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for 
tcover behind the wrecked car.

tThe driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front 
tseat and closes the door.

tHe moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets 
tsomething and returns to the cab. He throws open the door 
tand grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the

tback inside and lock their doors.

tBiggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the 
tmiddle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet.

tKimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the 
tground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain 
tclicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water.

tRunning water.

tA DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips 
toff his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues 
tstraight ahead.

tSomewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit
twall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong 
tto...

tGerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the 
tforking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.

ttGot a possible here. Stand by.

tHe stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with

tGerard begins the tricky descent. Slips once. Recovers. 
tSlips again...

t... and tumbles out of control. GUN and RADIO CLATTER AWAY.

tScrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe. 
tGerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, 
tlying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets 
tthere first.

tIt's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand 
tflexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

<b>ttttKIMBLE
</b>ttI didn't kill my wife.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttSo, you didn't kill your wife.

tNot my problem.

tAn adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the 
tsilence is broken by Gerard's radio.

<b>ttttBIGGS (V.O.)
</b>ttGerard? You there?

tGerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.

tInstantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up 
tpiece.

<b>tINT. CONDUIT - DAY
</b>
tAs Renfro hears FOOTSTEPS POUNDING his way.

</b>ttStraight ahead!

</b>
tKimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance 
tin the tunnel. He spills around a corner and stops. Ahead 
tlies an orb of light. The tunnel ends. The NOISE is 
tincredible. Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and 
tstops.

<b>tKIMBLE'S POV
</b>
tWater pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam

tmists. No rocks. None visible at least.

</b>ttTurn around, hands over your head. 
ttAnd get down on the ground.

tFor a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttYour choice, Kimble...

tKimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the 
twater. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts 
tup his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the 
twater toward Kimble.

<b>ttttGERARD

tKimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the

tsomething invaluable about this fugitive.

tshallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.

tFarther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.

</b>
tGerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with 
tthe next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD 
tILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.

tKimble begins to occupy his attention:

tA dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He 
tstares at him.

tA farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks 
taway. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is 
the calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.

tSomeone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him 
this soup. Where's the first waitress?

tTakes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he 
tsees:

tThe Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she 
tgoing to report him? He fights the paranoia.

tA NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

tthe counter and exits.

<b>tEXT. DINER - NIGHT

</b>
tKimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both

thear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves 
tfaster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to 
ta jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the 
tinevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him 
tchasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble 
tlooks at himself. He's shaking.

tstreet, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see 
tthat Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless 
twoman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a 
tradio.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttHell, no. You're with me, Newman. 
ttLet's go.

<b>tINT. HOUSE - DAWN
</b>
tTextbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room.

<b>tTHEIR POV
</b>
tDown the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT 
<b>tOF VIEW.
</b>
tA woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING.

<b>tGERARD
</b>
tMotions Newman to the left to check the door off the living 
troom while he moves down the main hall into the back 
tbedroom.

<b>tANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN
</b>
tClearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door 
toff the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. 
tHe steps into -

<b>tSMALLER BEDROOM
</b>
tIt's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to 
tthe bedroom.

<b>tHALLWAY
</b>
tGerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and 
tcontinues down the hall into the back bedroom where the 
twoman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move 
tsilently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman 
topens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward 
tthe doorway to the kitchen.

tGerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. 
tHe braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty.
tSuddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tSMALLER BEDROOM
</b>
tNewman looks around, suddenly scared. The only place he 
tdidn't search was behind the bedroom door. He turns just as:

<b>tCOPELAND
</b>
tSurges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand. In a flash, 
tCopeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a 
tknife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the 
troom.

tWe...

<b>tINTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>tGERARD
</b>
tHe hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.

<b>ttttCOPELAND (O.S.)
</b>ttI got your man! Now I want outta 
tthere!

tGerard moves back through the bedroom past the SCREAMING 
twoman. He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving 
tfugitive.

<b>tON COPELAND AND NEWMAN
</b>
tCopeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs 
tthrough the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -

<b>tLIVING ROOM
</b>
tNewman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against 
this throat.

<b>ttttCOPELAND
</b>ttt(to Gerard)
ttYou hear me? I said, I want out or 
ttI'll cut your man's throat!

<b>tGERARD
</b>
tKeeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses 
tat door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.

<b>tLIVING ROOM
</b>
tCopeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the 
thallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard.

tSuddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He 
twhips Newman around and we see:

tA shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too 
tlate. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

tHe never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. 
tThe knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, 
tstunned but unhurt.

tGerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the 
tbedroom doorway.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttShut up.

tShe does. Immediately.

<b>tEXT. HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
tAs coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across 
tthe yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a 
tsheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly 
thysterical, clutching his ear.

<b>ttttNEWMAN
</b>ttMy ear... I can't hear a thing out 
ttof it. I can't believe you did that!

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttYou think I should have bargained 
ttwith him, don't you?

<b>ttttNEWMAN
</b>ttYes. You could've missed! You 
ttcould've killed me!

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttYeah, you're absolutely right. I 
ttcould've.

tThey hold a look.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttHow bad's your ear?

<b>ttttNEWMAN
</b>ttTerrible. I probably have permanent 
tthearing damage.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttLet me see it.

tNewman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttI don't bargain.

tGerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly 
tunsettling man Gerard is.

twe see Anne Eastman beside him. Her I.D. says: 
t"ANNE EASTMAN". She sees him doing the rearranging.

tThe elevator arrives. They step into:

tAfternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets 
tof Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over 
tKimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, 
tmaking notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable 
tattachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking 
tfor a key to the identity of the one-armed man.

tFinally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it 
ton the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and
tcovers his face.

tDraws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the 
tProsthetic Clinic material.

tKimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, 
the's sweating, preparing for the worst.

tHe watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of

tOverhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

tEnters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the

tis fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door 
t- trapping him partially inside the revolving door.

tOther doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees 
tGerard.

tKimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - 
tbut slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd,
tshoves a man out of his line of fire.

</b>ttDown. down. everybody down!

tWith adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the 
topening...

</b>
t... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like 
tin a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks
tback over his shoulder at...

tGerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and 
tclear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.

</b>ttKimble. Stop!

tIt's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his 
tleg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as

tGerard FIRES seven times in two seconds.

tKimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A 
tlong beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with 
tbullet holes, he sees...

tKimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's 
talive. He runs free.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttOpen the doors!

tGerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the 
tglass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. 
tIt's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble 
trush across the street and disappear into the parade.

tDoors open and Gerard and his men follow.

tBut Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations

tHe looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus 
tshifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car 
tparked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans 
tacross the seat and opens the door for him.

tHe hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, 
the shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a

tKimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns 
tthe pages.

tThe man looks over the newspaper at Kimble, then goes back

tKimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble 
tin the stomach, knocks him back. The fight carries on 
tthroughout the car.

tKimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and 
taims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and 
talmost smiles.

tFor a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the 
tgun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. 
tThen hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, 
tdriving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost 
tunconscious.

tKimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit 
tCop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead.

tKimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the 
tCop's belt. He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the 
tCop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop.

toff the floor.

tout the front window and...

</b>
tKimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves 
tcarefully into the laundry.

t... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with 
tDEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry 
tmove from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of 
theavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers.

t... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses 
tstamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by

tNichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an 
texit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible 
tgrating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving.

<b>tKIMBLE
</b>
tNotices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He 
tstops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of 
tthe room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving 
tbetween the large conveyors.

<b>tANGLE - SORTING ROOM
</b>
tGerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters 
tstanding by a small conveyor as he enters.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttGet out of here.

tHe and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry 
tworker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead 
trail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off 
tswitch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker 
ttakes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.

tGerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the 
tmain room.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttt(to Renfro)
ttWe're going in. Give me five

tHe sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the 
tdryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt 
thim when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.

tKimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a 
tvoice from the other end of the laundry.

tMoving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room 
twhere Gerard enters.

<b>tON GERARD
</b>
tThe door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.

tThey enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves 
tup the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both 
tmove slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated 
tequipment.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>tt... There is no way out of here.

tThe building is locked down.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>

</b>
tMoves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near 
tthe conveyor belts.

<b>ttttGERARD (O.S.)
</b>ttKimble... I know about Nichols. I 
ttknow about Sykes. Kimble stops.

<b>tON GERARD
</b>
<b>ttttGERARD
</b>tt... Nichols borrowed your car the 
ttnight of the murder and called 
ttSykes from it.

<b>tRENFRO
</b>
tSeparated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag 
tcomes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, 
tdodges it, gets his bearings and continues.

<b>tKIMBLE
</b>
tListening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with 
tNichols.

<b>tGERARD
</b>
tMoving through the forest of massive bags.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>tt... That's why there was no forced 
ttentry at your house. He'd used your 
ttkeys.

<b>tKIMBLE 
</b>
tRealizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.

<b>tNICHOLS
</b>
tAlso listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the 
tkiller. He moves behind the water softener tanks and 
tchemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the 
thanging control for the I-beam.

<b>tGERARD
</b>
tMoves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He 
tdodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can 
tsee straight back toward the washers. 

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttKimble... Come meet me out here.

<b>tON RENFRO
</b>
tHe steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks 
tunder the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a 
tWHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes 
trushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, 
topening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.

<b>tNICHOLS
</b>
tSteps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty 
tshoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. 
tNichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.

<b>tGERARD
</b>
tOblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor 
tbelts. He makes one last appeal.

<b>ttttGERARD
</b>ttIt's time to quit running... if you 
ttdon't, you know I'll stop you. He 
ttlistens, there is no answer.

<b>tKIMBLE
</b>
tStarts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His 
tshoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.

<b>tGERARD
</b>
tMoves into the alley between the two giant washers. He 
tpauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back 
ton us...

<b>tNICHOLS
</b>
tSteps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just 
tbefore he fires however he hears...

<b>ttttKIMBLE (O.S.)
</b>ttHey, Chuckles...

tNichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick 
tand clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor 
tbehind Gerard.

<b>tGERARD
</b>
tTurns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble 
twith Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes 
tinstantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.

tKimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.

tThey hold a look as deputies and police flood into the 
troom surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.
