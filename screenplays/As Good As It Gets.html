<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an 
tenormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up 
tagainst the cold -- turning back to call inside to the 
tunseen love of her long life.

<b>tttSWEET-FACED WOMAN
</b>ttI'm just going to get some 
ttflowers, dear. I'll be back in 
tttwenty minutes. It's tulip season 
tttoday. I'm so happy.

tAnd now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness 
tdissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that 
tquickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her 
tapartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.

<b>tPOV - MELVIN UDALL
</b>
tin the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved, 
tunsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever 
tmet. Right now all his considerable talent and strength 
tis totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the 
televator door he holds open.

<b>tttMELVIN
</b>ttCome here, sweetheart... come on.

<b>tON DOG
</b>
tSniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. 
tMelvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the 
tmutt who has ignores him.

<b>tttMELVIN
</b>ttWanna go for a ride? Okay, 
ttsweetie?

tThe dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges 
tand picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog 
turine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG 
tsensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.

<b>tttMELVIN
</b>ttt(a malevolent tone)
ttYou've pissed your last floor, you 
ttdog-eared monkey.

tThe dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much 
tmeaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout 
tshut with his hand and reaches for the door of the 
tgarbage chute.
<b>tttt
</b><b>tttMELVIN
</b>ttI'll bet you wish you were some 
ttsort of real dog now, huh? Don't 
ttworry...  this is New York. If you 
ttcan make it here, you can make it 
ttanywhere, you know? You ugly, 
ttsmelly fuck.

tAnd with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and 
tlets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING "ANOOOOS" 
tfrom the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment 
tdoor opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON 
tNYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with 
tGothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of 
ttrauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.

<b>tINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tFrantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about 
tto enter his apartment.

<b>tttSIMON
</b>ttVerdell!?!! Here, good doggie... 

tHe notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.
<b>ttt
</b><b>tttSIMON
</b>ttMr. Udall... excuse me. Hey 
ttthere!
ttt(as Melvin turns)
ttHave you seen Verdell?

<b>tttMELVIN
</b>ttWhat's he look like?

tMelvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is 
tdirectly opposite Simon's.

<b>tttSIMON
</b>ttMy dog... you know... I mean my 
ttlittle dog with the adorable 
ttface... Don't you know what my dog 
ttlooks like?

<b>tttMELVIN
</b>ttI got it. You're talking about 
ttyour dog. I thought that was the 
ttname of the colored man I've been 
ttseeing in the hall.

tSimon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend.

<b>tttSIMON
</b>ttWhich color was that?

<b>tttMELVIN
</b>ttLike thick molasses, with one of 
ttthose wide noses perfect for 
ttsmelling trouble and prison 
ttfood... 

tSimon has had it.

<b>tttSIMON
</b>ttFrank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.

<b>tttMELVIN
</b>ttt(not missing a beat)
ttHow're you doing?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttFranks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I 
ttthink you know that.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttt(overlapping)
ttSimon, you've got to get dressed.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttt(to Simon)
ttWhat I know is that as long as you 
ttkeep your work zipped up around 
ttme, I don't give a fuck what or 
ttwhere you shove your show. Are we 
ttbeing neighbors for now?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttt(to Frank)
ttDo you still think I was 
ttexaggerating?

tFRANK can only smile.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttDefinitely a package you don't 
ttwant to open or touch.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttHope you find him. I love that 
ttdog.

tSimon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds 
thimself compelled to turn back toward Melvin.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttt(directly)
ttYou don't love anything, Mr. 
ttUdall.

tSimon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the 
thallway.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI love throwing your dog down the 
ttgarbage chute.

<b>tINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tMelvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to 
tfive with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and 
toff and on five times and makes a straight-line towards 
this bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens 
tthe medicine chest.

<b>tINT. MEDICINE CHEST
</b>
tScores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps 
tone -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the 
tprocess two more times.

<b>tINT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT
</b>
tA group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN 
tholding Verdell who looks and finds:

<b>tSIMON
</b>
twho looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves 
tquickly toward the group and his dog.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttThank the good Lord... wow... my 
tthoney... where have you been?

<b>ttttPARTY GOER
</b>ttt(thinking the greeting's 
tttfor him)
ttHe always liked me.

tAs Simon goes past him to take the dog from the 
tHandyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a 
tlaugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As 
tthe others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside. 
tJackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks 
tsome awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts 
tVerdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS 
tin protest.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttJust for a second, okay?

tThe DOG YAPS "no." Simon, delighted, picks him up again.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttt(kissing him on the mouth)
ttLook at him...  where was little 
ttbaby?

<b>ttttHANDYMAN
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttIn the basement garbage bin eating 
ttdiaper shit.

tSimon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in 
tcheek, trying to suppress his amusement.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttGo ahead, John, you earned your fun.
ttt(looking at Verdell)
ttHow did he get down in the 
ttbasement? I mean even if he got 
tton the elevator how... ?

<b>ttttHANDYMAN
</b>ttMaybe some nice neighbor shoved 
tthim down the garbage chute.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttMy God! No!

tHe stares out... Frank frustrated following.

<b>tINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tQuiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he 
twrites.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>tt'Somewhat in the dark, she had 
ttconfessed and he had forgiven. 
ttThis is what you live for, he 
ttsaid. Two heads on a pillow where 
ttthere is only the safety of being 
ttwith each other. How, she 
ttwondered, could she find such hope 
ttin the most shameful part of her.'

tHe barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.

<b>ttttSIMON (O.S.)
</b>ttMr. Udall.

tBut Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>tt'At last she was able to define 
ttlove. Love was... '

tMore KNOCKING.

<b>ttttSIMON (O.S.)
</b>ttMr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you 
ttplease.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>tt'Love was... '

tHe almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of 
tlove -- but the knocking throws him.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>tt... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed-
ttstool-pusher.

tHe burst from his chair.

<b>tINT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tAs Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step 
tback. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttt(loud and angry)
ttYeeeess!!!

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttMaybe this can wait.

tFrank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttI found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttWell, that's a load off.

tMelvin walks back into the apartment and is about to 
tclose the door when Simon has another burst of bravery.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttDid you... do something to him?

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttDo you realize that I work at 
tthim?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttt(eyes downcast)
ttNo, I didn't.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttDo you like to be interrupt when 
ttyou are danging around in your 
ttlittle garden?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttNo...  actually, I even shut the 
ttphone off and put a little piece 
ttof cardboard in the ringer so no 
ttone can just buzz me from d... 

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttWell, I work all the time. So 
ttnever, never again interrupt me. 
ttOkay? I mean, never. Not 30 
ttyears from now... not if there's 
ttfire. Not even if you hear a thud 
ttfrom inside my home and a week 
ttlater there's a smell from in 
ttthere that can only come from a 
ttdecaying body and you have to hold 
tta hanky against your face because 
ttthe stench is so thick you think 
ttyou're going to faint even then 
ttdon't come knocking or, if it's 
ttelection night and you're excited 
ttand want to celebrate because some 
ttfudge-packer you dated has been 
ttelected the first queer President 
ttof the United States... and he's 
ttgoing to put you up in Camp David 
ttand you just want to share the 
ttmoment with someone...  don't knock
tt...  not on this door. Not for 
ttanything. Got me. Sweetheart?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttYes. It's not a subtle point 
ttyou're making.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttOkay, then.

tMelvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttSo the theory of confrontations is 
ttthat now he'll think twice before 
ttmessing with me?

tFrank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttHe's genuinely upsetting, isn't 
tthe?

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttWon't worry about it. You go 
ttahead.

tFrank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly 
ton Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor.

<b>ttttMELVIN (O.S.)
</b>ttOh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really 
ttpissed!!!

tFrank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open. 
tFrank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him 
tforward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttNo touch. No touch. No touch.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttYou may think you can intimidate 
ttthe whole world with your 
ttattitude, but I grew up in Hell. 
ttMy grandmother had more attitude. 
ttYou don't intimidate me.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttt(calling)
ttPolice! Police! Fucking crooked 
ttpolice...  doughnut-munching morons 
tthelp me!
ttt(to Frank)
ttAssault and battery and you're 
ttblack.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttShhhh now. I like Simon. I like 
tthim enough to batter you 
ttunrecognizable if you verbally 
ttabuse him or so much as touch his 
ttdog again. Meanwhile, I'll try 
ttand think how you can make this up 
ttto him.
ttt(suddenly loud)
ttI hate doing this. I'm an art 
ttdealer.
ttt(beat)
ttHave a nice day. Party!

tHe tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens 
this shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as 
the re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears 
timpressed.

<b>tEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
tA crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His 
twalk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the 
tdanger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. 
tAt times he places his palms together and extends his 
tarms cutting a path through people. We will be very 
tpointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.

<b>tCLOSER ON MELVIN
</b>
tHis eyes focused on the terrain.

<b>tINT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
<b>tANGLE ON WAITRESS
</b>
tCAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer. 
tYou would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be 
tthe most carefree time of the day. She is telling a 
tstory about her son for the umpteenth time.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(to the Mother's 
tttlittle girl)
ttLook at you, you're all better.

<b>ttttMOTHER
</b>ttIt's that new medication.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttYou know all my son's stuff, 
ttright?

tThe Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but 
tCarol interrupts her.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttNo, no, no, I got a date tonight. 
ttI'm walking out the door this 
ttmorning and he says to me, 'Mom, 
ttI promise not to get one of my 
ttfevers or coughs during your 
ttdate.'

<b>ttttMOTHER
</b>ttIsn't that sweet.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttLittle blonde angle.
ttt(to child, 
tttaffectionately)
ttEat everything.

tMelvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a 
ttable towards the back and is obviously surprised to find 
ta MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttIt just came out of me. I said 
ttyou love me the way a remote 
ttcontrol loves a TV. As long as I 
ttswitch every time... 

<b>ttttHER MALE COMPANION
</b>ttWonderful.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttPeople who talk in metaphors can 
ttshampoo my crotch.
ttt(on their look)
ttEat up.

tThey turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the 
twaitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL, 
tare talking.

<b>ttttLISA
</b>ttPay me back next week.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttI owe you. I told you today... 
ttthem's the rules. Oh, excuse me, 
ttMelvin.

tShe puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out 
tof the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else 
tever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI'm starving.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(firmly to Lisa)
ttWill you please take it?

tMelvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with 
tstealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out 
tof the way... 

<b>ttttLISA
</b>ttThis way you take a cab home so 
ttyou have time to get ready for the 
ttdate.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>tt"Ready" is not my problem.

tShe barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could 
tread Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the 
tdate talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(to Melvin)
ttGo sit down. You know you're not 
ttallowed back here...  Spencer's 
ttmore excited about it than I am... 
ttHe says, "Mom, I promise not to 
ttget a fever or couch during your date."

tThe other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go 
t"awww."

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttI know. He's just the best.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI've got Jews at my table.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttIt's not your table. It's the 
ttplace's table. Behave. This 
ttonce, you can sit at someone 
ttelse's station.

tThe two waitresses signal their protests.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttOr you can just wait your turn... 

tMelvin walks back into the restaurant proper...  he hangs 
tnear their table...  his discomfort builds in this limbo... 
tthen:

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttHow much more you got to eat? 
ttYour appetite isn't as big as 
ttyour noses, is it?

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttWhat?!!

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttt(to Woman)
ttLet's go --

tThe Woman starts to protest.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttLet's leave. We're going.

tMelvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his 
tpocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed. 
tAs he opens his utensils.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttBryan says he doesn't care how 
ttlong you've been coming you ever 
ttact like this again you're barred 
ttfor life. I'm gonna miss the 
ttexcitement, but I'll handle it.

tThere is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some 
tingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only 
tone in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear 
tthe table.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttThe table's fine if it had some 
ttcholesterol on it. Two sausages, 
ttsix bacon strips, fries, three 
tteggs over easy and coffee.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttYou're gonna die soon with that 
ttdiet, you know that?

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttWe're all gonna die soon. I will. 
ttYou will. It sure sounds like 
ttyour son will.

<b>tON CAROL
</b>
tStunned. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her 
tperfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin 
tsenses that he's gone way too far. He wipes his knife.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttIf you ever mention my son again, 
ttyou will never be able to eat here 
ttagain. Do you understand? Give me 
ttsome sign you understand or leave 
ttnow. Do you understand me... 
ttt(adds truthful label)
ttyou crazy freak? Do you?!?

tA beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing 
tdown.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttOkay. I'll get your order.

tShe walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower 
tlip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.

<b>tINT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tShe is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room 
tsofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make 
tnoises as she responds...  each time startling herself 
twith her own noise and trying to reign it in.

tShe's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway 
t-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the 
temergence of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young 
tMan stops and looks at her.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttI...  I...  I don't know...  You got 
ttme.

tHis eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited 
tbut doesn't know how to play it...  He pushes one of the 
tfingers of the hand caressing her face toward her 
tmouth...  She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt 
topening her mouth. She stops him.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttLet me just do whatever I do by 
ttmyself...  I'll catch up to you 
ttsomeplace I promise.
ttt(as he's put off)
ttOh, no...  don't look like that. 
ttNo. I'm sorry if I'm a goof.

tAnd so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed 
tthe sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about 
tegg in your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when 
twe hear from the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and 
<b>tCOUGHING.
</b>
<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttKissing...  kissing boys. Oh my.

tCarol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues.

<b>ttttSPENCER (O.S.)
</b>ttt(softly)
ttGrandma, grandma... 

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttMaybe you better check.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttLike what did you think I was 
ttgoing to do?

<b>tINT. HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tPulling herself together she goes off down the hallway... 
tshe ducks her head into the first bedroom where her 
tmother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones... 
tshe takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the 
tcough.

<b>ttttBEVERLY
</b>ttI'm sorry. I was hearing just 
tteverything you were doing so I put 
ttthese on to give you privacy.

tCarol now goes into her son's room.

<b>tINT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tThe room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights... 
ttwo drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer 
t(breathing contraption) a waste basket...  a night stand 
tfilled with medicine, a blood pressure kit...  along with 
tsome stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged 
tinto the tiny space.

<b>ttttSPENCER
</b>ttI'm sorry.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttDon't be silly. How bad?

<b>ttttSPENCER
</b>ttNot bad.

tCarol feels his head...  that's okay. Then he coughs -- 
ttrying to suppress it...  then a bigger cough...  they each 
tknow what that signals...  She brings up a waste basket as 
the throws up...  she comforts him. He apologizes. She 
tloves him.

<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tAs she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(a bit panicked)
ttYou can't smoke...  He can't take 
ttsmoke.

tHe palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand 
tsqueezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his 
thand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he 
tpicked up while feeling her and then notices him looking 
tat her with extreme distaste...  She barks a laugh to 
tcover her embarrassment but speaks the truth.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttOh, God...  I don't even notice 
ttanymore.

tShe crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel. Tries to make 
tlight.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttThat'll teach you.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttDon't apologize.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(perturbed)
ttThat wasn't an apology.

tShe notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her -- 
thow uncomfortable he is.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttHey...  this is just a little throw-
ttup -- it's nothing to be so 
ttembarrassed about. Really.
ttt(as he shifts 
tttuncomfortably)
ttThanks for the dinner. Let me 
ttwrite down which trains you take 
ttto get back.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttNo way.

tShe brightens.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttI'll take a cab.

tShe deflates as he moves past her.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttToo much reality for a Friday 
ttnight.

<b>tEXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT
</b>
tA cold night in hell. Three young men bullshit near the 
tapproach to the tunnel. Their names are VINCENT, EVAN 
tand DOUG, who is the oldest at 28. Vincent is dopey and 
tthe most likeable of the gritty little trio.

<b>ttttEVAN
</b>ttWhy is every customer surprised I 
ttread books?

<b>ttttDOUG
</b>ttt(amazed)
ttYou read books?

<b>ttttEVAN
</b>ttOh, wow! I know this guy! Look! 
ttHe even bought me dinner.

tThey all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in 
tfront of them. CARL checks them out carefully through 
tthe front window. He is talking on the speaker phone.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttt(slightly exasperated)
ttLook, I just can't. I promised 
ttSimon I'd find him a model.

<b>ttttFRIEND (V.O.)
</b>ttt(on speaker phone,
tttflirting)
ttCarl, take me off the speaker. 
ttDid I tell you that these are 
tthouse seats? C'mon, you could use 
tta break. Hello...  Carl, are you 
ttthere...  hello?

tSeeing the hustlers:

<b>ttttCARL
</b>.tt...  I just found a model.

<b>ttttDOUG
</b>ttt(to Carl)
ttHey, how it's goin'... 

<b>ttttEVAN
</b>ttHey, hi...  remember?

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttI only need one.

<b>ttttEVAN
</b>ttYou picked me up, maybe a few 
ttweeks, I don't know, some time 
ttago. You were very flattering 
ttabout our...  encounter.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttMaybe just you and me...  but this 
ttis for a painting. I need a 
ttpretty face.

tCarl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal 
this pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.

<b>tINT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
tThere is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer. 
tHe is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace 
thumming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who

</b>ttSorry, I was out in the studio

t-- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him 
tand eyeing the expensive apartment.

tSimon sneaks a look at the canvas from another 
tperspective...  he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod 
tof self-approval -- he's finished. Vincent is desperate 
tto distract.

tCLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his 
tears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to 
tfrantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention.

tAs Simon keeps walking...  Vincent shoots over to the 
tcanvas.

</b>ttWait -- I want to see the

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttJust a second -- he has to go.

<b>ttttVINCENT
</b>ttPlease!! NO!!!

tto see his humanity captured -- to be "immortalized."

tThe music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped

thim suspect this feast is a trick. He sniffs 
tcautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC MUSIC CHANGING on a

tof RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the bathroom -- then 
tMUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns...  ignoring Verdell he 
tsits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. It's odd. 
tVerdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl 
twith his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and 
tsing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of 
tLife," with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks 
tover with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts

thighest-stakes fight for survival. Momentarily a scared, 
tbeaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.

</b>ttMy son is sick, okay?

tEven saying the sentence, "My son is sick" pushes some

tthe leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance.

twith the moment of catharsis... 

t...  but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the

tThe room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol

</b>ttCarol the waitress?

tAs we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her

tstraight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is 
tstatic city, standing on end as he periodically gives it 
tself-conscious pats.

ttI'm not going to sleep with you.

ttwice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his 
tbody angles from the bed in a deliberate way.

tHe is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays

tis let in by Beverly.

ton the brink of crying.

tCarol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able 
tto stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she 
tlooks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission 
tfor Carol to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol 
t-- and then she is overwhelmed. The headline comes first.

</b>
tCarol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf 
tof the closet.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttWell, here's a little suitcase 
ttshocked that it's been used.

tShe holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's 
ttoo pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another 
tdrawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries 
tof the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself.

<b>tINSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER
</b>
tHer best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday 
t"girl Jockies." She fingers the good stuff -- puts it 
tback -- then the everyday -- hesitates.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(furiously exasperated)
ttThere's not way to pack for this 
tttrip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm 
ttnot packing the camera.

tAs she exits the room --

</b>
tAs she picks up the phone.

<b>tINT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tMelvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly 
tstacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a 
tcamera). He has a list of what he needs. All items -- 
tunderwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each 
tone and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds 
tanother check. The PHONE RINGS. This is an amazing 
tdevelopment. He has almost no recent experience with 
treceiving a nighttime phone call. He makes a little 
tcomment to himself as he moves.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttWoo-woo.

tHe stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is 
t-- and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but 
tbefore bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his 
tthroat.

<b>tON CAROL
</b>
tAs she hears his throat being cleared. It is not a 
tpretty sound. (The following conversation is INTERCUT.)

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttHello?

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttAre you still coming?

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttYes.

tMelvin visibly relaxes.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttMelvin... I'd like to know exactly 
ttwhere we are going.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttJust south to Baltimore, Maryland. 
ttSo I know what you're going to ask 
ttnext.
ttt(correcting himself)
ttThat you might ask -- I'm not 
ttcertain.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttThere's... there's no need to 
ttbring anything dressy... or... I 
ttmean -- I didn't know if we'd be 
tteating at any restaurant that 
tthave dress codes.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttOh.
ttt(a beat)
ttWe might. Yes. We can. Let's.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttOkay, gotcha. What did you think 
ttI was going to ask?

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttWhether crabs are in season there 
ttnow...

tBeverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters.

<b>ttttBEVERLY
</b>ttHow was it talking to him?

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttStop treating this like I'm going 
ttaway with a man. He's just going 
ttto say those crappy, sick, 
ttcomplaining, angry things to me. 
ttI hate this, Mom -- I hate this. 
ttHe's a freak show -- the worst 
ttperson I ever met.

ttYou stand there and I'll wave to

tAs she boards the bus.

</b>ttt(to Spencer)
ttI love you.

tThe bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them 
topen.

</b>ttt(to bus driver)
ttSensitive, huh?!

tThe bus pulls out. He runs after the bus -- waving at 
this mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing 
thimself.

</b>
tA female VETERINARIAN in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as 
tMelvin finishes filling out some forms.

tOn opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black 
tdog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners.

<b>ttttVETERINARIAN
</b>ttAnything unusual in the dog's

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttNo. Everybody gets their own

tCarol disembarks.

<b>tEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY
</b>
tAs she walks and turns a corner.

<b>tCLOSE ON CAROL
</b>
tThe shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death 
tchamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do 
tnot buckle. She does not whimper. No prison "screws" 
twill have to support her weight. Still, the prospect 
tcouldn't be grimmer.

<b>tCAROL'S POV
</b>
tMelvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open.

<b>tCLOSER ON MELVIN
</b>
tHe is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the 
ttussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the 
tbuilding.

<b>ttttFRANK
</b>ttI'm sorry that I'm not taking 
ttyou.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttt(upset)
ttSo am I, Frank.

tFrank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttSoak it up -- it's your last 
ttchance at a hug for a few days.

tAs Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor 
tchanges... that quickly there is a shyness.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttHi.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttThanks for being on time... Carol, 
ttthe waitress, this is Simon, the 
ttfag.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttHello... Oh, my God, who did that 
ttto you?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttI, uh... I was... attacked. 
ttWalked in on people robbing me. I 
ttwas hospitalized. I almost died.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttLet's do the small talk in the 
ttcar. Load up.

tCarol puts her bag in the car.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI was going to do that for you.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(taken aback)
ttIt's okay. No problem. Where 
ttshould we sit?

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttt(totally non-plussed)
ttI -- uh, I... Well, there is no 
ttplace cards or anything.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(to Simon)
ttLet me go in back. You look like 
ttyou need all the room you can 
ttmanage.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttThat's very thoughtful.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttNever a break. Never.

tCarol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's 
tnot sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small 
tback seat. She struggles to get her feet in. 

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttYou're really jammed back there.

tHe reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his 
tseat and, with some effort,  wrenches it forward giving 
tCarol more room and putting his right against the wheel. 
tShe is startled by the gesture.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttThanks, Melvin.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttWelcome.

tAnd off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.

<b>tEXT. 12TH STREET
</b>
tTurning onto Fifth.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI got the whole ride programmed.

tCAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all 
tcarefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the 
tone marked "ICEBREAKER." It is a song which we clearly 
tand quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick 
tburst of "Y.M.C.A." Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttJust wanted to see what you'd do. 
ttNo, we have greatness here.

tHe goes for another CD labelled "FOR USE TO REP THINGS 
<b>tUP."
</b>
tThe car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY 
<b>tSELECTED MUSIC.
</b>
<b>ttttCAROL (O.S.)
</b>ttHey, I like this music.

tAnd, as the MUSIC PLAYS, Simon looks out.

</b>
tThe three of them... Carol chattering away.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttI don't know the last time I've 
ttbeen out of the city... Hey, my

ttgreat. We gotta stop soon so'se 
ttI can check on Spencer.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttt(during the above)
ttI'm sorry... I can't hear you. I 
ttcan't turn my head all the way 
ttyet... tell her we can't hear her.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttDoesn't matter. She's enjoying 
ttherself. Consider it part of the 
ttmusic.

<b>tEXT. ROAD - DAY
</b>
tA short time later. Carol is now driving.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttI'm sure, Simon, they did 
ttsomething real off for you to feel 
ttthis way... But when it comes to 
ttyour partners -- or your kid -- 
ttthings will always be off for you 
ttunless you set it straight. Maybe 
ttthis thing happened to you just to 
ttgive you that chance.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttNonsense!

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttAnybody here who's interested in 
ttwhat Melvin has to say raise their 
tthands.

tSimon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus 
tdeclared their majority.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttDo you want to know what happened 
ttwith my parents?

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttYes. I really would.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttWell... 

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttNo, let me pull over so I can pay 
ttfull attention.

tCar pulling over toward parking spot.

<b>tEXT. HIGHWAY - CURBSIDE - CONVERTIBLE - DAY
</b>
tShe takes the car curbside and parks.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttNow go ahead.

tSimon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks 
tinnocent. Several beats -- Melvin almost says something 
t-- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttWell, I always painted. Always. 
ttAnd my mother always encouraged 
ttit. She was sort of fabulous 
ttabout it actually... and she used 
ttto... I was too young to think 
ttthere was anything at all wrong 
ttwith it... and she was very 
ttnatural. She used to pose nude 
ttfor me... and I thought or assumed 
ttmy father was aware of it.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttThis stuff is pointless.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttHey -- you let him... 

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttYou like sad stories -- you want 
ttmine.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt. Go ahead, Simon. Really. 
ttPlease. Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttOkay. Well, one day my father 
ttcame in on one of those painting 
ttsessions when I was nine -- and he 
ttjust started screaming at her -- 
ttat us -- at evil. And... 

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttt(very quickly)
tt... my father didn't leave his 
ttroom for 11 years -- he hit my 
tthand with a yardstick if I made a 
ttmistake on the piano.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttGo ahead, Simon. Your father 
ttwalked in on you and was yelling 
ttand... really, come on.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttI was trying to defend my mother 
ttand make peace, in the lamest way. 
ttI said, "she's not naked -- it's 
ttart." And then he started hitting 
ttme. And he beat me unconscious. 
ttAfter that he talked to me less 
ttand less -- he knew before I left 
ttfor college, my dad came into my 
ttroom. He held out his hand. It 
ttwas filled with money. A big wad 
ttof sweaty money.
ttt(gathers himself)
ttAnd he said to me, "I don't want 
ttyou to ever come back." I grabbed 
tthim and I hugged him... He turns 
ttand walked out.

tCarol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as 
tstrange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so 
tmuch more complicated than her meat and potatoes 
ttroubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her 
tfingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice, 
tunderstated, gesture of friendship.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttWell, you know -- I still stay 
ttwhat I said. You've got to get 
ttpast it all when it comes to your 
ttparents. We all have these horror 
ttstories to get over.

tMelvin shifts INTO the FRAME.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttThat's not true. Some of us have 
ttgreat stories... pretty stories 
ttthat take place at lakes with 
ttboats and friends and noodle 
ttsalad. Just not anybody in this 
ttcar. But lots of people -- that's 
tttheir story -- good times and 
ttnoodle salad... and that's what 
ttmakes it hard. Not that you had 
ttit bad but being that pissed that 
ttso many had it good.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttNot it at all, really.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttt(a veteran's irony)
ttNot at all, huh?!... Let's go to 
ttthe hotel. And if you're lucky 
tttomorrow Dad will give you another

ttNo answer... Maybe we should just 
ttdrive there tomorrow. Can I have 
ttthat one?

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttYes... sure.
ttt(to Simon)
ttI'll take the sofa.

tCarol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever

tSimon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.

tthere. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new 
tfactors in her life.

ttI never saw him playing ball. Come

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttDancing?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttI can't, I'm exhausted.

tCarol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is 
tvisibly disturbed by her gesture.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(to Simon)
ttI don't blame you... This is a 
ttmonumental first day out... You 
ttsad or anything?

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttNo... Nervous. It would be very 
ttrough, Carol, if you weren't 
ttalong.

</b>ttWhat a nice compliment.

tShe gives Simon a kiss... Melvin deals with jealousy. 
tShe turns to him.

</b>ttI'm happy. And you're my date. 
ttLet's get dressed.

tShe exits the room. Melvin unnerved.

ttsays 50 or 60 percent of the time 
tta pill can really help. I hate 
ttpills. Very dangerous things, 
ttpills. "Hate," I am using the

tAmazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- 
tso that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- 
tthen:

</b>ttYou make me want to be a better 
ttman.

tCarol never expected the kind of praise which would so 
tslip under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered, 
tmomentarily moved and his for the taking.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttThat's maybe the best compliment 
ttof my life.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttThen I've really overshot here 
tt'cause I was aiming at just enough 
ttto keep you from walking out.

tCarol laughs.

</b>ttSo how are you doing with those 
ttpills? Well, I hopahopahopa.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttTakes months to know... They work 
ttlittle by little.
ttt(holds his head; 
tttthen)
ttTalking like this is exhausting.

tCarol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very 
tclose -- he tenses.

</b>ttHave you ever let a romantic

ttknow is stupid?

</b>ttNever.

</b>ttHere's the trouble with never.

<b>tTIGHT SHOT
</b>
tfor the kiss. Their faces are close -- she looks at 
thim... She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him 
t-- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves

tnow his head moves back and he receives her kiss. It is 
tbrief. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself. 
tMelvin can't bear the pleasure.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttYou don't owe me that.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttThat wasn't payment. When you 
ttfirst came into breakfast, when I 
ttsaw you -- I thought you were 
tthandsome... Then, of course, you 
ttspoke... So now that your soft 
ttli'l underbelly is all exposed. 
ttTell me, why did you bring me?

tMelvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable... 
tas he holds up his hands in a "stop" signal.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttWell, ah... that's a personal 
ttquestion.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttTell me even if you're scared. 
ttTell me why you wanted me here. 
ttIt's okay.

tShe kisses him again.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttIf you ask me... I'll say, "yes."

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttt(dissembling)
ttThere are lots of reason... I had 
tta thought that if you had sex with

</b>ttt(humiliated)
ttSex with Simon?

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttIt's one idea... 

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttThat's why you brought me? Look 
ttat me! Is that really why you 
ttbrought me... Like I'm a what and 
ttI owe you what?!

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI don't know why I brought you -- 
ttthat idea occurred to me is all... 
ttIt came out first... Hey, you kiss 
tthim -- me... He says he loves 
ttyou. You two hit it off. But you 
ttdon't want to... fine... Forget 
ttwhat I said about sex with Simon. 
ttIt was a mistake.

ttI'll never forget you said it.

</b>ttIt was a mistake.

tBut she has already turned away and exits the

</b>ttOur room. I don't want to see him 
ttand he's not going to come

</b>ttCan you not be violent?

ttGood night.

</b>ttGood night.

tWe are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or

tfaces the bathroom and we have...

</b>
tCarol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now 
tas Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair 
t-- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast 
texposed...

</b>ttt(a whisper)
ttHold it.

tHe leaves the bed.

</b>
tWhat's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set 
tand a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair 
tand with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of 
tthe bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttI've got to sketch you.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttNo... Absolutely not. I'm shyer 
ttthan you think. I give the wrong

</b>ttI haven't even been thinking about 
ttsketching for weeks.

</b>ttStop staring. Do a vase.

</b>ttThanks. But I just want to take a 
ttbath and...

</b>ttThat long neck -- the line of 
ttyou... you're porcelain... your 
ttback goes on forever. You're 
ttclassic... you're why cavemen 
ttchiseled on walls... 

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttAll right, cut me a break.

tSimon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him 
tearnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly 
tbut deliberately she lowers the towel. He's right. 
tShe's breathtaking.

tMelvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to 
tthe bartender.

</b>ttSo then, the next thing I know, 
ttshe's sitting right next to me, 
ttand then, well, it's not right to

ttwrong thing and if I hadn't, I 
ttcould be in bed now with a woman 
ttwho if you could make her smile

tstyle cramped by his cast.

<b>ttttSIMON
</b>ttNo. No. This is great, this is 
ttso great. I can't get the angle 
ttwith this cast.

tHe struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle 
tno more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece 
tfrom the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically -- 
ta lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center.

tThe door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better 
tthan ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.

</b>ttDid you have sex with her?

tCarol follows his out. Her arms are filled with the

</b>ttSorry, didn't realize she was

ttt(a beat)
ttDid you have sex with her?

tMelvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings 
tthe bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in

</b>ttI get why you're angry. It's no 
ttsnap to explain why I was like

</b>tt... so Mom. Truly no grudges --

</b>ttAnother place where?

</b>ttDoes it matter?

tMelvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a 
tspecial CD labelled "For Emergency Use Only." As it 
tPLAYS a confessional love SONGS:

</b>ttI don't want to hear that music 
ttright now.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttWhat do you mean? You said you

<b>tBACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI'm sorry I woke you -- some other 
tttime.

tHe half turns to leave.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttI wasn't asleep!!

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttWhat a break... 

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(losing it a bit)
ttIs it a secret what you're doing 
tthere?

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI had to see you... 

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttBecause... 

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttIt relaxes me... I'd feel better 
ttjust sitting on the curb in front 
ttof your house than anyplace else 
ttI can think of or imagine.

tCarol has not ever heard anything like that before... 
tit's sort of sexy in its sincerity.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tAs we see in the b.g. that Beverly, standing near her 
tdoor down the hallway, has heard at least this last 
tpart... 

tMelvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone... 

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttt(serious)
ttWait a minute, I'm overstating 
tthere, maybe the inside stairs. I 
ttdon't want to sit with my feet in 
ttthe gutter. What does that serve? 
ttIt only... 

tBut suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttStop it!! Why can't I have a 
ttnormal boyfriend??? Why? Get out 
ttof here. Just a regular boyfriend 
ttwho doesn't go nuts on me... 

<b>ttttBEVERLY
</b>ttt(butting in)
ttEverybody wants that, dear -- it 
ttdoesn't exit... 
ttt(as Carol turns 
tttto her)
ttSorry... didn't mean to interrupt.

tShe disappears into her room. Carol snorts a laugh -- 
tgathers herself. A beat.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttt(hopefully)
ttBoyfriend?

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttOh, come on in and try not to ruin 
tteverything by being you.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttMaybe we could live without the 
ttwise cracks.

tShe looks at him -- then:

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttMaybe we could... 

tMelvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen 
tlinoleum and stalls at the door.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttIt feels a little confined here. 
ttLet's take a walk.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttSee. It's four in the morning. A 
ttwalk sounds a little screwy to me, 
ttif you don't mind.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttIf you need an excuse, there's a 
ttbakery on the corner. There's a 
ttshot it'll open soon -- that way 
ttwe're not screwy -- we're just 
tttwo people who like warm rolls.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttOkay.

<b>tEXT. STREET - NEAR BAKERY - NIGHT
</b>
tThey walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual 
tattention to where he steps.

<b>tCAROL'S POV
</b>
tMelvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement -- 
tit is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids 
tstepping on the lines.

<b>tBACK TO SCENE
</b>
tCarol sighs. It is the sound of possibilities crashing 
tdown. Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious 
t-- his habits making him appear unworthy.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttt(gently; almost 
tttlovingly)
ttI'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever 
ttthis is -- is not going to work.

<b>tON MELVIN
</b>
tHe takes this hard. It forces him to half-whisper 
tsomething he hasn't at all said to himself... given his 
thistory... this is an extraordinary intimacy.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI'm feeling... I've been feeling 
ttbetter.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttMelvin, even though it may seem 
ttthat way now -- you don't know me 
ttall that well... 
ttt(as he scoffs)
ttI'm not the answer for you.

tShe starts to turn. He tugs at her arm. As she turns 
tback to him.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttHey, I've got a great compliment 
ttfor you.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttYou know what? I... 

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttJust let me talk.
ttt(gathers himself 
tttwith uncertainty, 
tttthen:)
ttI'm the only one on the face of 
ttthe earth who realizes that you're 
ttthe greatest woman on earth. I'm 
ttthe only one who appreciates how 
ttamazing you are in every single 
ttthing you do -- in every single 
ttthought you have... in how you 
ttare with Spencer -- Spence... 
ttt(he has reached 
ttther)
tt... in how you say what you mean 
ttand how you almost always mean 
ttsomething that's all about being 
ttstraight and good... 

<b>tON CAROL
</b>
tShe stands on the precipice of being transported away 
tfrom the logic which has been her lifeline.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI think most people miss that 
ttabout you and I watch wondering 
tthow they can watch you bring them 
ttfood and clear their dishes and 
ttnever get that they have just met 
ttthe greatest woman alive... And 
ttthe fact that I get it makes me 
ttfeel great... about me!
ttt(a real question 
tttfilled with 
tttconcern for her)
ttYou got a real good reason to walk 
ttout on that?

tThat last question clearly a true question, not the least 
trhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttNo! It's certainly not. No -- I 
ttdon't think so. No.

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttt(tentatively)
ttI'm gonna grab you.
ttt(with conviction)
ttI didn't mean it to be a question. 
ttI'm gonna grab you.

tHe kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate. 
tA tense beat. Then:

<b>ttttMELVIN
</b>ttI know I can do better.

tThey embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A 
tfirst-class smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot 
tland squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his 
tknowledge. They break -- look at each other without a 
tnotion of where to take it from here, and the ALMOST in 
tunison begin to walk away FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a 
tpath that avoids cracks. Suddenly the lights of the 
tbakery turn on as it opens for business.

<b>ttttCAROL
</b>ttWarm rolls... 

tThey walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks. As 
tthey enter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to 
tclean the entranceway. Melvin, forced to step back onto 
ta crack, this time notices -- registers the momentous 
tfact and joins Carol inside as we:

<b>tttttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b>tTHE END
