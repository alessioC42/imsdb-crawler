</b>
<b>tINT. OHIO STATE SUPREME COURT - DAY
</b>
tIn chambers striving for august, JUSTICES listen to a lawyer 
tMR. RODMAN, argue his case before the highest court in Ohio.  
tMr. Rodman enjoys the sound of his own voice.

<b>ttttMR. RODMAN
</b>ttThis informant, paid by the police, 
ttusing taxpayers dollars to continue 
tthis felony drug habit, was the link 
ttwhich allowed police to raid a private 
ttfarm.  A working farm.  A farm where 
tthonest Americans make their living.

tOne particular justice, ROBERT WAKEFIELD, younger than the 
tothers, is clearly bemused by this performance.

<b>ttttMR. RODMAN
</b>ttThe government, in its haste, has 
ttemployed an army of criminals whose 
ttallegiance to the truth is, at
ttbest, questionable --

tJudge Wakefield interrupts --

<b>ttttROBERT
</b>ttMr. Rodman...it's too bad your client 
ttdidn't show as much sense in choosing 
ttwhat he planted as he did in choosing 
tthis attorney...

tA polite chuckle from the justices --

<b>ttttROBERT
</b>ttLately the only variation I'm hearing 
ttin your argument is the name of the 
ttclient.  And you can sit there all 
ttday arguing the ins and outs of 
ttIllinois v. Gates, but you aren't 
ttgoing to convince me that this country 
tthas not sanctioned the use of 
ttanonymous informants.
ttt(beat)
ttFurthermore, there is no sacred 
ttprotection of property rights in the 
ttUnited Sates.  When you make the 
ttdecision to have marijuana on your 
ttfarm, whether it's one joint or an 
ttacre of plants, your property can be 
ttseized and your property can be sold.

<b>ttttMR. RODMAN
</b>ttI'm sorry the court finds my argument 
ttrepetitious.

<b>ttttROBERT
</b>ttMr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of 
ttadvice?  The next time you argue 
ttthis point before this court, 
ttregardless of my whereabouts, I 
ttrecommend you have something up your 
ttsleeve other than your arm.

tA broken down-looking Police Sedan is parked on the side of 
tthe road.  It seems abandoned except there are TWO MEN inside.

</b>
tTwo Mexican men, State Police officers, JAVIER RODRIGUEZ, 
t30's, and MANUEL "MANOLO" SANCHEZ, 20's, wearing jeans, knock-
toff Polo shirts, and cowboy boots, wait patiently in the 
tcar.

<b>ttttJAVIER
</b>ttI had that dream again.

tA long pause.

<b>ttttMANOLO
</b>ttWhich one?

tAnother long pause.

<b>ttttJAVIER
</b>ttWhere my mother's suffocating.

tThey continue to wait until there is the sound of a JET 
tENGINE.  It grows LOUDER as it approaches.

<b>tEXT. THE POLICE SEDAN - DAY
</b>
tThe shadow of a large plane crosses the desert floor.  Then, 
tan old DC-3 flies fifty feet above the Police Sedan.

<b>tINT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY
</b>
tThey watch the plane disappear over a small rise in the 
tdesert.  They look at each other and wait some more.

<b>tEXT. MEXICAN DESERT - LATER
</b>
tFrom the direction of the landing strip, a moving van lumbers 
tdown the road, two TEENAGERS in the cab.

<b>tINT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY
</b>
tJavi and Manolo watch the moving van approach.  Javi reaches 
tunder the seat and picks up a bubble flasher.  He rolls down 
tthe window and plants it on the roof.  He flips the switch.

tNothing happens.  He jiggles the wire and the siren BURPS 
tand the light flashes.  Manolo and Javi step from the car, 
tsmiling.

<b>tEXT. MEXICAN DESERT - DAY
</b>
tThe moving van slows to a stop.  Javi approaches.  The DRIVER 
tunhurriedly rolls down the window.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttIs there a problem?

<b>ttttJAVIER
</b>ttNo.  There's no problem.

tThe driver hesitates a confused beat then reaches for his 
twallet.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttOkay.  I see.  How much do you want?

tThe driver pulls a wad of bills.  Javi shakes his head.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttYou want more than this?

tJavi shakes his head.  The driver exchanges a look with his 
tpartner.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttYou want something else?

tJavi smiles.  The driver gets out and walks to the back of 
tthe truck.  He opens the rear door.  There are neatly-stacked 
tcrates marked with a SCORPION logo and "911."  He reaches 
tinto one of them and pulls out a tightly-sealed package also 
twith the scorpion stamped on it.  He turns to see Javi with 
this gun drawn.

tManolo, at the passenger side, has also drawn his gun and is 
tmotioning the partner to move to the back of the truck.

<b>ttttJAVIER
</b>ttDrop the package.  Put your hands 
ttbehind your head.  You're under 
ttarrest.

tThe driver hesitates.  He starts to comply then looks at 
tJavi and Manolo.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttI don't understand.  I think there 
ttmust be some mistake.

<b>ttttJAVIER
</b>ttNo, there's no mistake.

tJavi motions to Manolo who cuffs both teenagers.  The driver 
tbegins spewing OBSCENITIES under his breath.  Javi puts the 
tdriver in the front of the Shadow.  Manolo follows in the 
tmoving van.

<b>tEXT. DIRT ROAD - MEXICO - LATER
</b>
tThe truck follows the Shadow down a desert road.

tSuddenly, from behind, four armored SUV's with tinted windows 
tappear, closing fast.

tThe SUV's force both vehicles off the road where they pull 
tto a stop.  A long beat as hot wind blows desert detritus 
tpast the truck.

tFinally, the SUV doors open and FEDERAL POLICE OFFICERS 
tsurround them like a SWAT team.

tThe passenger door of the lead SUV opens and GENERAL ARTURO 
tSALAZAR, 50's, a squat, powerful presence in a perfectly 
tpressed uniform gets out and approaches Javi.

<b>ttttSALAZAR
</b>ttt(to Javier)
ttWhat's your name?

<b>ttttJAVIER
</b>ttJavier Rodriguez.

<b>ttttSALAZAR
</b>ttWell, Javier Rodriguez, you've done 
tta very good job, but we'll take care 
ttof it from here.

tJavier stares into the implacable reflection of his 
tsunglasses.  In the distance, the DC-3 takes off and ROARS 
tover their heads.

<b>ttttSALAZAR
</b>ttWe've been following these Narco-
tttrafficantes for some time but had 
ttnot been able to bring them to 
ttjustice.
ttt(to his men)
ttPut the prisoners in the car.
ttImpound the truck.

tThe men follow Salazar's orders.

<b>ttttSALAZAR
</b>ttt(to Javi)
ttOne question.  How did you find about 
ttthis?

<b>ttttJAVIER
</b>ttAn informant.

<b>ttttSALAZAR
</b>ttWhat is the name of your informant?

<b>ttttJAVIER
</b>ttt(beat)
ttIt was an anonymous tip.

tSalazar looks at Javi a beat.

<b>ttttSALAZAR
</b>ttt(to his men)
ttFor a State Police officer, you're 
ttvery well informed.  Let's go.

<b>ttttMOMENTS LATER
</b>ttJavi and Manolo watch the convoy of 
ttvehicles drive away.

tJavier lights a cigarette.

<b>ttttMANOLO
</b>ttWasn't that General Salazar?

<b>ttttJAVIER
</b>ttYeah.

tGORDON, 40's, suspicious of everyone including himself and 
talways, always the smartest guy in the room, walk from a

tIt's a cluttered, rundown working office unusual only in the

tCastro switches into Spanish --

ttGood afternoon, ladies, gentlemen.  
ttWe're looking for Eduardo Ruiz.  We

tIn a back alcove, Castro and Gordon sit across a cheap table 
tfrom EDUARDO RUIZ, 40's, an entrepreneur in an expensive 
tsuit and bad hairpiece.  They are waiting.

</b>ttYou ever buy a quarter ton?  Not

tdisappear into the bay of a storage unit.  A man is pulling 
tdown the door behind it when three unmarked squad cars ROAR 
tinto the lot, surrounding the unit, officers exit the cars 
twith their guns drawn -- Gordon and Castro stare in disbelief.

tRuiz FIRES the gun under the desk which hits Gordon full in 
tthe chest, knocking him backwards.

tRuiz's men run into the room pulling guns.

tCastro dives and pulls his weapon, firing at Ruiz's men,

tFrom all over the stake-out location, DEA AGENTS emerge firing 
ttheir weapons.  An equal number of FBI AGENTS emerge firing 
tin return.  Nobody was aware of the other's presence.

tIt's CHAOS, a clusterfuck of law-enforcement zeal with three 
tcompeting sets of good guys shouting through BULL-HORNS, 
tGUNSHOTS and SCREAMING.

tRuiz breaks through the corner of the lot, cutting between 
ttwo buildings.  Castro emerges and chases him.

<b>tEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

tCastro enters The Fun Zone.  There's a cardboard cutout of

tversion of Jar Jar Binks, promoting the "Special Edition" 
tglass: "Collect All Four."  There's an enclosure filled with 
tcolored plastic balls.

tThe restaurant is empty except for a CLOWN filling out a

tCastro makes a motion for him to be quiet and keeps moving 
ttoward the room of colored balls.

tGordon enters the restaurant and follows him.  An ANIMATRONIC 
tBAND starts to play a SONG.

tGordon sees a half-hidden foot buried underneath the plastic 
tballs at the far end of the room.

tHe takes careful aim and FIRES.

tRuiz SCREAMS and sits up.  Castro pounces on him, disarming

tSeth takes out a box of baking soda.  He tears off a square 
tof aluminum foil.  He takes out a spoon.  Caroline watches 
tas he dumps a small amount of cocaine into the spoon.  He 
tadds a pinch of baking soda.  He puts in a few drops of water.

tHe watches the substance in the spoon as it swirls and

tonto the aluminum foil, making four separate little puddles.

tHe quickly dismantles a ballpoint pen, making a straw.  He 
thands it to Caroline.

</b>ttInhale the smoke and hold it.

<b>ttttCAROLINE
</b>ttWhat is this, like freebase?

tThere's a rush of thick grey smoke.  Caroline catches most 
tof it.

</b>ttHold it.

tShe pulls it in deeper and holds... Suddenly her expression 
tchanges... Her eyes lose their focus, her face slackens, an

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttSee... Now, you see.

tCaroline slumps back against the counter.  Seth moves against 
ther, kissing her, running his hands over her breasts and 
tbody.  She stares over his shoulder, holding it as long as 
tshe can.

tFinally she exhales --

ttnow I work for you.  I'm not a

ttIn the next few weeks, if you allow

ttwhether it was even aimed at him, 
ttwhich personally I think it very 
ttself-defeating.  Now, don't get me

tRobert and Landry shake hands.

<b>ttttROBERT
</b>ttYou've done a fine job here, Sir.

</b>ttI'm not sure I made the slightest

ttI tried...  I really did.

</b>ttThere are a lot of encouraging

ttbut I intend to see it through.  
ttYou've got my word on that.

</b>ttI've come in to do a tough job and

ttand you'll be saved.  And when you 
ttget into another situation you can't

ttand it worked like a charm.

</b>ttWe in the legal drug business, and I

ttAnd if you want a body count look no

tt80,000 kills a year.  Cocaine manages 
tta measly 2,000.  Same for Heroin.  
ttBut, the big daddy is Big Tobacco

</b>ttWhat's the difference between Prozac

</b>ttt(whispering)
ttChemicals?  Some say problems, others

</b>ttt(to the undersecretary)
ttYou're not battling traffickers or

tHelena is relieved, but she's not looking at Arnie and when 
tshe does she sees him shaking his head in a very definitive, 
t"No."

tArnie stands and continues talking as he walks to the windows

tThe blinds are closed.  Arnie crosses to Helena and talks 
tvery softly in her ear.  She's a beautiful woman and Arnie 
tmanages to make this act seem both practical and

<b>ttttROBERT
</b>ttTo begin with, she's only sixteen

tHe calls again, this time apparently loud enough for her to

</b>ttMy client is no more a flight risk

tAdler is in a role he relishes.  Helena drives away.  We

tThere are pictures of her and her friends on the walls: goofy

tcutouts from magazine pictures and copy.

tOn the sink next to her is a little square of well-charred 
taluminum foil; she's done many hits.  She leans over and 
tpicks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in

tShe picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen she's 
tturned into a straw.

tShe heats the bottom of the foil.  The crack "crackles."

tShe chases the smoke across the foil.  A huge hit.  She leans 
ther head back, her eyes roll back, she tries to focus on the 
tmagazine, on anything, she stares up at the ceiling.

tShe holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the 
texhaust fan.

tCaroline looks at her watch.  It's 7:20.  She stands suddenly, 
tunsteadily.  She looks at herself in the mirror.

tShe's really high and indecisive.  She looks around wildly.

tShe sees the shower.  She turns it on.  She drops her pajamas.

tShe goes back to the foil and hits another piece of the rock, 
ttaking another really big hit.  She crushes the foil and 
tflushes it down the toilet.  She hops in the shower.

ttof drugs are still getting through.

<b>ttttROBERT
</b>ttAny idea how much?

<b>ttttOFFICIAL
</b>ttI've read official estimates but I 
ttwouldn't bet my house on them.  I've 
ttheard the entire cocaine supply for 
ttthe United States can fit into four

ttAt least a half-dozen of those cars 
ttright out there are carrying a load 
ttof dope, with drivers employed by 
ttpeople who don't give a damn if 
ttthey're caught or not.

<b>ttttROBERT
</b>ttWhat do you look for?

<b>ttttOFFICIAL
</b>ttWe ask questions and measure the 
ttanswers.  When something doesn't 
ttring true, a fact that doesn't make 
ttsense, a slight hesitation, then 
ttit's off to secondary for a closer 
ttlook.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 
ttmillion trucks a year.  Now it's 
ttalmost double.  Pretty soon there'll 
ttbe Mexican truck companies that will 
tthave as much freedom in crossing the 
ttborder as American truck companies.

<b>ttttROBERT
</b>ttAny way we can do it better?

<b>ttttOFFICIAL
</b>ttSure.  More money in intelligence on 
tttheir side of the border.  So we 
tthave a better idea who we're looking 
ttfor.  More dogs.  More people.  
ttSupposed to be getting some giant x-

ttthrough.  Outside of martial law 
ttthat's about the best you're gonna

</b>ttThat triple the amount of stuff is 
ttgoing through.

<b>ttttOFFICIAL
</b>ttRight.  But, that's not the biggest 
ttproblem.  One of our Intel officers 
ttpicked up information from DEA that 
tttraffickers have come up with a 
ttprocess, a chemical process, to turn 
ttcoke into something else.  It doesn't 
ttsmell like coke.  It doesn't look

tRobert is standing in the middle of her room.  He's not sure 
twhat he's looking for.  Everywhere he looks: her personal 
tthings, beloved objects from more innocent times, pictures.

tWithin moments a legitimate desire to connect with his 
tdaughter has escalated into a search for clues.  He opens 
ther drawers, dumps little boxes, pulls things off of shelves.

tHe becomes increasingly unhinged, flinging things around her 
troom.  He tosses a stack of magazines.  A fashion magazine, 
tairborne, discharges some contents: a lighter, a plastic 
ttube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the 
tground.

tRobert stares at the foil on the carpet.  It's charred on 
tthe outside.  He picks it up.  And unfolds it.  There's a 
tdried milky white substance.

tHe picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them.  Then, 
tsomewhat tentatively, he puts the tube in his mouth.  He 
tholds the lighter under the foil, then heats the milky 
tsubstance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud 
tof smoke.  Robert sucks all of it in.

tHe waits a long time then exhales.  His eyes shut.  The tube 
tdrops from his mouth.  He staggers and, overwhelmed by the 
tsensations, sits on the bed.  The lighter and foil fall from 
this hands.

tA moment later he opens his eyes and doesn't seem to know 
twhere he is.  He looks at the room, confused.  He stumbles 
tto the door and shuts it firmly behind him.
