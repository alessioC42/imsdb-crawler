                              by

<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tNEW YORK CITY - AERIAL VIEW OF DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY
</b>
<b>tMULTIPLE STREET SCENES - DAY
</b>
tThe sidewalks crowded as usual.  A sea of humanity.  People
tcome and go -- always in a hurry.  Oblivious of one another.

tA TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction
tworkers; A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse; VENDORS
tPEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels; PANHANDLERS blocking a
tpasserby.  Intimidating.  Demanding.  Almost mocking.

tWe're surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we've
tcome to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound.

tMULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East
tSide and West Side -- uptown and down.

tOne frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he
ttakes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver
tviolently against the coin box until the instrument splinters
tinto a dozen pieces.

<b>ttttNARRATOR
</b>ttThere are 237,911 pay telephones in
ttthe five burroughs of the city of
ttNew York.  Many of them are still
ttin working order.

<b>tDOZENS OF QUICK CUTS --
</b>
tNEW YORKERS on the phone in extreme close up.  We don't hear
tthe words.  Only the facial expressions inform us that these
tare human beings under tremendous pressure.  Life in the city
tis wearing them down.

<b>tMULTIPLE SHOTS - JUST MOUTHS
</b>
tLips jabbering into receivers.  Cross-cut against one
tanother.

<b>ttttNARRATOR
</b>ttDespite increased usage of cellular
ttdevices, an estimated four and a
tthalf million New Yorkers and two
ttmillion visitors still utilize pay
tttelephones on a regular basis.  At
ttthirty-five cents a pop... for the
ttfirst three minutes.

<b>tANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY
</b>
tThere's a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the
tstreet.

<b>ttttNARRATOR
</b>ttYou're looking at the telephone
ttbooth at the corner of 45th Street
ttand 8th Avenue in the heart of the
ttManhattan theatrical district.  It
tthas been scheduled to be removed
ttand replaced by a kiosk.  It's one
ttof the few remaining phone booths
ttleft in the city.

tCAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very
twell-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in
tappearance.

<b>ttttWOMAN IN BOOTH
</b>ttt(into receiver)
ttYou have lied to me for the last
tttime, you lowlife prick bastard!  I
ttdon't ever want to hear the sound
ttof your fucking voice again.
ttt(listens)
ttYes, well fuck you, too!

tShe slams down the receiver and exits.  The booth remains
tvacant for a brief interval.

<b>ttttNARRATOR
</b>ttAt least three hundred calls daily
ttoriginate from this booth.  The
ttcoins are collected twice a day. 
ttThis booth has been burglarized
ttforty-one times in the last six
ttmonths.

tSomeone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for
tcoins.  This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair
tstyled and his nails manicured.  Here is a man who clearly
ttakes excellent care of himself.  He sports a Donna Karen
tsuit and silk Armani tie.

tHe's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a
tmiddle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby
trestaurant and has finally caught up with him.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttStu, we got to talk.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWish I could accommodate you,
ttMario, but this is my busy time of
ttday.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttHow come you cross the street every
tttime you go past the restaurant?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy don't I stop in later for some
ttlunch?

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttThere's no more drinks or free
ttmeals until the restaurant starts
ttshowing up in the columns like you
ttsaid.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm doing my level best for you
ttpeople.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttOne lousy mention in the Post and
ttyou expect to eat for six months!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI got the food critic from the
ttVillage Voice all lined up to give
ttyou a review.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttThat's what you tell me last July. 
ttAnd he never shows.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI was allowing you time to expand
ttthe menu.  Wallpaper the bathrooms,
ttfor God sakes.  You get only one
ttshot with these fucking critics and
ttI don't want you to blow a rare
ttopportunity.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttYou the one blowing it.  How long
ttyou think you can fuck everybody?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHold on right there.  I've got a
ttvery excellent reputation around
ttthis town.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttSo how come you take two nice suits
ttof clothes from Harry and never get
tthis daughter on David Letterman?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHell, I'm not an agent.  I'm a
ttpublicist.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttMister, you're nothing!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttBelieve me, Valerie's on the
ttwaiting list to audition.  Harry's
ttgot no complaints.  He just let me
ttpick out this tie the other day.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttThat Harry's a damn fool!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttMario, please let me make this up
ttto you.  How about I arrange for
ttthe opening night party for this
ttnew off-Broadway show I'm handling 
tt-- to be held at your place with
ttlocal TV coverage on nine and
tteleven?  I mean I had it promised
ttto another client -- who actually
ttpays me money.  But it isn't firmed
ttup yet.  And I could throw it your
ttway.  Maybe.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttWhat is involved?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou'd toss in the buffet for say
ttseventy or eighty.  The producers
ttwould supply their own vino, of
ttcourse.  I'd deliver you a
tttruckload of celebrities.  And if
ttthey like the food, they'll all
ttcome back, naturally.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttWhat celebrities?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou want Liza Minelli?  An Oscar
ttwinner.  Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.?

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttIs he still alive?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI saw him last night going into the
ttFour Seasons.  I'll bring you over
tta whole VIP list when we come by
ttfor dinner.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttHow come everybody wants to eat but
ttnobody wants to pay?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou can't think small like that. 
ttHey, you still feature musicians
ttFridays and Saturdays?

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttAt least they work for their meals.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat about Harry's daughter as an
ttextra added attraction?  She'll
ttbelt out five or six showtunes --
tttwo sets a night -- and it won't
ttcost you a fucking nickel.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttHow come?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttStar Showcase!  Let me handle
ttsetting that up.  And when she
tteventually goes on Letterman,
ttshe'll announce I'm currently
ttappearing over at Mario's fine
ttsupper club.  Right over CBS she'll
ttsay that, Mario.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttYou're full of shit.  You know
ttthat?  All bullshit!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThat's just a vulgar word for PR.
ttt(placing an arm around
ttthim)
ttMario, you can't hurt my feelings. 
ttEven when I was a kid and they
tthurled certain invectives my way,
ttit never bothered me.  Other kids
ttwould fall apart if anybody called
ttthem a fucking name.  Me, I just
ttloved the attention!  'Shit-for-
ttbrains' -- that's what the bigger
ttkids named me.  And I answered to
ttit.  Hey, 'shit-for brains'
ttreporting for duty.  Everybody
ttloved me for that.  I could take
ttabuse.  After a while, I kind of
ttwore them down.  There was nothing
ttmore they could say to me.  So they
ttstopped.  I kind of missed it.

<b>ttttMARIO
</b>ttI'm sorry I even talked to you.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'll bet your loving wife put you
ttup to this.  She saw me pass by and
ttshe sent you out in the street. 
ttBut I don't hold it against you
ttpersonally -- you still serve up
ttsuperior veal chop.
ttt(entering phone booth)
ttNow I got urgent business to
ttconduct, Mario.

tHe slides the booth closed in Mario's face.

tThe frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass
tbefore giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he
tgoes up the block.

tINSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and
tdials.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHello, Mavis, sweet creature.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttWhere have you been?  Do you think
ttI have nothing to do but wait
ttaround for you to call?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm only a few minutes late,
ttloveliest individual on earth.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttStu, I'm so lonely.  When can I see
ttyou?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttGood news in that arena.  Kelly
ttgoes into rehearsal as of Monday. 
ttYou know how dedicated she is.  By
ttthe time she gets back from dancing
tther ass off, she goes right to
ttsleep.  We'll have both our days
ttand certain nights.  Not to mention
ttwhen they take the show on the
ttroad.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttHow long is that for?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttFour to five weeks -- minimum.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttMaybe I should quit my job so we
ttcan be together full time.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI wouldn't do that.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttSometimes I think if I have to give
ttone more fucking manicure...

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThat's how you met me.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttI never saw a worse set of nails. 
ttBit right down to the quick.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm much better groomed since
ttyou've been looking after me.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttI'm glad you admit it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttEven Kelly remarked on it when I
ttfirst met her.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttShe could care less how you look. 
ttShe's only interested in pushing
tther own career.  Some wife you're
ttstuck with!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThe marriage is not without its
ttcompensations.  Do you imagine I
ttcould afford that apartment on what
ttI'm earning?  Not with everybody
ttcutting back on the publicity.  Not
ttto mention a million college
ttgraduates coming into the
ttprofession trying to cut me out. 
ttAnd one thing you can't expect from
ttyour clients is loyalty.  They get
tta couple of bad notices, they dump
ttyou.  Goodbye.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttDon't go.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI wasn't saying goodbye to you.  I
ttwas saying how the clients try to
ttgive you the wave off without even
tta month's notice.

tA conservative businessman now stands outside the booth
twaiting to use it.  He deliberately glances at his watch a
tfew times to demonstrate his impatience.  This bothers Stu
twho slides the booth open a crack.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttWhat?  Is your watch busted?  It's
tttwenty after eleven and I'm gonna
ttbe occupied indefinitely with my
tttransaction.  So get out of my
ttface!

tHe closes the booth up again and turns his back to the
tgentleman who gives up and departs.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttSorry, honey.  There will be no
ttfurther interruption.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttWhy must you always be calling me
ttfrom some booth?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOn account of that phone records
ttare regularly subpoenaed in divorce
ttproceedings.  And I don't want some
ttentry showing up on my cellular
ttbill either.  She gets the mail. 
ttShe looks these items over. 
ttSometimes she even dials up a
ttstrange number to see who it is.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttThen she suspects something.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt's only because her last husband,
ttthe choreographer, ran around on
tther.  She can't get that out of her
tthead.  That's how she caught onto
tthim.  The phone bills.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttShe hasn't developed much skill at
ttholding a man.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou know what a self-fulfilling
ttprophecy is?  She was so sure I was
ttgoing to find me a woman that she
ttfinally drove me back to you.  I
ttthought I'd feel all guilty about
ttit -- but I guess it hasn't kicked
ttin yet.
ttt(beat)
ttStill, I wouldn't do anything to
tthurt her.  Basically, Kelly's a
ttdecent individual.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttWhat about hurting me?  Like last
tttime?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHurt?  You were glad to be rid of
ttme.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttFor a while I was, 'til I took
ttstock of what was around.  You're
ttthe lesser of many evils.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThat's about the nicest thing you
ttever said.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttI'll have it engraved.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWe've been up front with each other
ttfrom the beginning.  Let's keep it
ttthat way.  How about a drink?  Say
ttseven o'clock?  The Monkey Bar?

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttMeet me in front.  I don't like
ttwalking in there unescorted.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYeah, you're great enough looking
ttto be mistaken for one of those
ttthousand dollar a night girls.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttIt happens all the time lately.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAnd wear that short black number I
ttbought you from Bendel's.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttAgain?  I don't know if it's me or
ttthat dress you like.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHave a good day.  Make plenty of
tttips.  And leave the whole evening
ttopen.  She thinks I've got Knicks
tttickets.

tHe hangs up.  Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his
tjacket pocket, flips it open and dials.  Someone answers on
tthe first ring.

<b>ttttCOLUMNIST (V.O.)
</b>ttSpeak!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into cellular)
ttIt's your boy Stuart.  When was the
ttlast time I called you for a favor?

<b>ttttCOLUMNIST (V.O.)
</b>ttThe column is already full.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI just need one line.  Anybody you
ttwanna say was seen dining out at
ttMario's Stromboli restaurant.

<b>ttttCOLUMNIST (V.O.)
</b>ttMaybe you don't hear so good?  I
ttgot no space for you.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWho's asking any favors?  I'm
ttoffering reciprocal information.

<b>ttttCOLUMNIST (V.O.)
</b>ttSince when were you ever a reliable
ttsource?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttCheck it out.  Tony award-winning
ttproducer Willie Beagle tossed his
ttwife back into rehab again
ttfollowing her third attempt at
ttdiving off the terrace at their
ttplush eighteen room residence at
ttthe San Remo.  I got it from the
ttdoorman.

<b>ttttCOLUMNIST (V.O.)
</b>ttI got it from their maid yesterday. 
ttIt's in the paper today.  Or don't
ttyou bother to read my shit?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLouis, my intentions were entirely
tthonorable.

<b>ttttCOLUMNIST (V.O.)
</b>ttI'll drop your item in sometime
ttnext week.  If you promise not to
ttcall me for a month.

tHe hangs up.  Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone
tand tucks it away.

tThen he starts to vacate the booth.  The phone rings.  And
trings.  Curious, he picks up the receiver.  There's a voice
ton the other end of the line.  A DISTINCTIVE MALE VOICE.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDon't even think about leaving that
ttbooth.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStay exactly where you are and
ttlisten carefully.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI've got a heavy day, mister.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou know better than to disobey me.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI don't know you at all.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAre you absolutely sure?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWho is this?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttSomeone who's watching you.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttGet lost!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttLove the gray suit.  That red and
ttblack tie makes a nice combination.

tStu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel. 
tHe looks around nervously.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhere?  Where are you?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttCloser than you think.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI don't see you.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThere are any number of windows. 
ttCheck them out.

tIndeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise
tbuildings and hotels.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOkay, you had your little joke.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'm not sufficiently amused.  Not
ttyet.  We have more to talk about.

tStu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him
tnot to.  Perhaps it's the strange tone of the man's voice.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttDo me a favor.  Call up somebody
ttelse.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBut it's you I'm interested in. 
ttYou know how many people use that
ttbooth every day?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy don't you tell me?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBetter than two-hundred people on
ttaverage.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIs that what you do?  Count them?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhat else do I have to do?  It's
ttinteresting watching people. 
ttTrying to guess who they are.  And
ttwhat they're up to.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat are you -- a shut-in of some
ttkind?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou might say that.  I can't go
ttout.  I might be seen.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttSomebody's looking for you?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDesperately.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThe cops?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttNot yet.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThe ex-wife.  What'd you do -- run
ttout on child support?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhat kind of man do you think I am?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttFrankly, I could care less.  You
tthad your fun.  Now goodbye.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIt's not in your best interests to
tthang up on me.  That would make me
ttangry.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIsn't that just too bad?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttFor you.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThere's ten million names in the
ttphonebook.  Pester somebody else.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI never talk to people I can't see. 
ttI need to study their reactions.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAlright, bullshit artist, what am
ttI doing right now?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttScratching your forehead with your
ttleft hand.  Now you're brushing
ttyour hair back.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOkay, okay, you got me in your
ttscrutiny.  So what?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttSo let's talk.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOnly I got nothing to say.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOh, you will.  You'll do a lot of
tttalking before this conversation is
ttover.  And it'll only end when I
ttwant it to.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIs that a fact?  Well if you watch
ttclosely, you will see me hang up.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI don't think you will.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy not?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI interest you.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy should I be interested in some
ttcreep who gets his jollies spying
tton strangers in phone booths?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBut you're not a stranger, Stu.

tThe sound of his own name sends a chill through him.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWho put you up to this?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou were my very own selection.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy me in particular?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBecause you're so afraid.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHa!  What've I got to be afraid of?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttJust about everything.  You have so
ttmuch to hide.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHow do you figure that?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhy else would a man with a
ttperfectly good cellular bother to
ttmake calls from a pay booth?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThat's my business.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI've made it mine.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAll of a sudden I'm required to
ttgive explanations to you?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIn explicit detail.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat is this?  Some kind of candid
ttcamera gag?  Or like that thing on
ttHBO where the cab driver is taping
ttwhat goes on in the back seat?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThis is not showbusiness, my
ttfriend.  This is reality.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYour reality.  Not mine, you
ttlowlife fuck.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStu, you'll be made to suffer for
ttyour attitude, so let's dispense
ttwith the vulgarities.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNow you're threatening me!  Fuck
ttyou.  Could that be any clearer?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou're only making it easier for me
ttto do you harm.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOh yeah.  Right.  Can you see how
ttI'm trembling?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou will be.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttShit, this is a new one.  Fucking
ttthreatening calls in a goddam phone
ttbooth.  When are you going to start
ttwith the heavy breathing.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'm not the degenerate.  You are,
ttStu.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou don't know anything about me.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttInfinitely more than you know about
ttme.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLike what?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttLike the number you dialed when you
ttfirst entered the booth.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHow would you know that?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'm watching through a scope and I
ttcould clearly read the buttons you
ttpushed.  I have another extension
tthere by the window.  Shall I dial
ttthat same number back for you? 
ttWould that convince you?

tStu nervously cranes his neck, looking around at all the tall
tbuildings that surround the street corner.

<b>tSTU'S POV
</b>
tPANNING up at thousands of windows.  The Voice could be
tcoming from anywhere.

<b>tBACK TO STU IN THE BOOTH
</b>
<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttLet's see who's on the other end of
ttthe line.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttDon't.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttToo late.
ttt(beat)
ttIt's already ringing.  I'll hold
ttthe receiver up so you can listen
ttin.

tStu can hear the beeping as the other line rings.

tThen Mavis' voice can be heard answering.  Stu listens
thelplessly.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttHello?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWell, hello.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttWho is this?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttSomeone who's really tight with
ttyour boyfriend -- who just called
ttyou from his favorite phone booth.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttYou know Stu?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStu?  Oh, I know him better than
ttanyone.  What he does -- how he
ttthinks.  How he lies.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttWho the hell is this?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStu is listening in.  He knows what
ttwe're both saying.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttStu?  Is that true?  Are you there?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHe doesn't feel like talking.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(shouts)
ttMavis!  Just hang up the goddam
ttphone.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttShe can't hear you, Stu.  Only me.
ttt(a pause)
ttMavis, I'm afraid Stu hasn't been
tttotally honest with you.  But then
tthe can't be honest with anyone, can
tthe?

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttWhat's your name?  To whom am I
ttspeaking?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou've never heard of me, Mavis. 
ttHe doesn't want you to know I
ttexist.  He wishes I didn't exist. 
ttBut there isn't anything he can do
ttabout that.
ttt(beat)
ttStill there, Stu?  All you can do
ttis listen.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttMavis -- the guy is a fucking
ttnutcase!  Hang the fuck up.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttShe doesn't want to.  She wants to
ttknow all about us.  Don't you,
ttMavis?

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttDid his wife put you up to this? 
ttThat bitch, Kelly?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOh yes, the bitch wife, Kelly.  My
ttvery next call.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(yells)
ttHe doesn't know my wife!  Don't
tttell him anything else.

tOutside the booth, a huge, heavy-set black woman in a too
ttight dress, now appears with the clear desire to use the
tphone.  Her name is FELICIA.  She taps on the glass.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttCould you hurry it along?

tStu ignores her and Felicia glares at him through the glass
twith hostility.

tStu has no inclination to deal with anybody else.  He's too
tdistracted by the madness happening over the telephone.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttCan you hear me, Mavis?  Keep your
ttbig mouth shut.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIs that any way to talk to a woman
ttyou love?
ttt(beat)
ttMavis, is he always that abusive to
ttyou?

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttYou're getting me all upset.  I
ttdon't know who you are or how you
ttknow all this --

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI find out things -- from watching
ttpeople and listening to them.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttJust what is your relationship to
ttStu?  That's all I want to know.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWell, what do you think?

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttAnswer me, goddam it!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWell alright.  Stu and I are --
ttlongtime companions.  A pair.  Two
ttof a kind.  Closer than close. 
ttPeas in a pod.  Spoons in a drawer.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttYou pervert!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThat, too.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttDon't believe a word of it.  It's
ttall lies.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttToo late, Stu.  She already
ttbelieves it.

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttYou can tell that scumbag never to
ttbother me again.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHe won't care.  He'll still have
ttme.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt's not true.  I do care.

tFrom outside the booth, there's a louder rapping on the
tglass.  Felicia really wants in.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttGet done in there, mister.  I got
ttme an important call.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttGo away.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttShit I will!  Finish up!

tShe continues to rap on the glass as Stu tries to focus on
tthe two-way phone call.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhy don't you tell me what you
ttthink of us?

<b>ttttMAVIS' VOICE
</b>ttYou're both disgusting.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThat's what he said about you. 
ttWell, if Stu didn't have the balls
ttto come out and tell you the truth,
ttI felt it was my responsibility to
ttclear the air.  Goodbye now, Mavis. 
ttThanks for your time.
ttt(the phone clicks off; we
ttthear only a dial tone)
ttBack to you again, Stu.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou total asshole!  How could you
ttdo that?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttSpeaking of females, that woman
tthovering outside the booth -- may
ttas well tell her that you'll be on
ttthe line forever.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLike hell I will.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'm ready for you to take out your
ttcellular and phone home.  And this
tttime, I'll listen in.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThere's no chance of that.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOr should I call Kelly and make up
ttsomething totally outrageous?  You
ttmust realize by now I have a vivid
ttimagination.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou don't know our phone number!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAre you absolutely sure?  I may
tthave been watching you on a regular
ttbasis.  Keeping track of all the
ttnumbers I see you dial.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAnd I'm supposed to believe that?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI've put a great deal of
ttpreparation into this -- prior to
ttactually saying hello.  Now do you
ttwant to dial 832-7165 -- or should
<b>ttI?
</b>
tThe sound of the actual number being spoken shocks him even
tmore than the earlier mention of his name.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat are you going to tell her?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou'll do the talking.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat am I supposed to say?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTry telling her the truth.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLook, I don't want to hurt Kelly. 
ttShe's always there for me.  It's
ttjust my nature to have a little
tt'strange' on the side.  It doesn't
ttmean shit.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBut you still find it necessary?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttKind of like having a beautiful
tthome.  With everything you ever
ttdreamed of.  But you still need
ttthat vacation now and then.  Some
ttnice hotel room with a great view. 
ttMaybe a pool.  Only you wouldn't
ttwant to spend more than a few days
ttin any hotel.  Eventually, you want
ttto go back to your home and all
ttyour stuff.  You're real glad to
ttcheck out.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttKelly is home and Mavis is a hotel? 
ttI'm sure they'll both appreciate
ttthat explanation.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou're ruining my fucking life, you
ttsonofabitch.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDidn't I warn you about calling me
ttnames?  It makes me vindictive.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat else can you do to me?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWe haven't even begun.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttShe's not home.  She went out.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'll bet she's back.  Now hold the
ttcellular up where I can see it --
ttso I can be certain you don't
ttmisdial on me.
ttt(pause)
ttA little higher and to your left. 
ttNow I have it in perfect view. 
ttDial slowly.

tMore violent rapping on the glass from the persistent black
tlady outside.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttIf you got you a cell phone, how
ttcome you taking up the whole
ttfucking booth!  This here's an
ttemergency!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThere's another booth on the next
ttblock.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttIt's busted.  Every damn phone on
ttEighth Avenue is busted but this
ttone.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWell, I'm not through!  Go in a
ttrestaurant or someplace, but get
ttaway from me!

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttI'm gonna pull you out of that
ttbooth and snatch you ballheaded!

tShe tries to pull open the sliding door to the booth but Stu
tjams it shut, right on her hand.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttYou assaulted my person.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLet me hear from your lawyer!

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttYou're hear alright.  I'm coming
ttback.  And your ass better not be
ttaround.

tShe stalks off obviously in search of assistance.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttGood work, Stu.  Now let me see you
ttdial.  Tuck the receiver under your
ttchin and dial your remote.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm doing it.

tHe punches in the digits.  The phone rings -- and rings.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI told you she was out.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttLet it ring.

tThen a girl's voice is heard.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttShepard residence.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHold it close to the receiver so I
ttcan hear.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttHello?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHoney, it's me.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttWhat's taking you so long?  I
ttthought we were having some lunch
ttat Mario's?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttChange of plan.  We're not eating
ttin that dump any more.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttHow come?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThe Health Department gave them a
tt'C' rating -- that's how come. 
ttHere I'm trying to put the place on
ttthe map and he fucks it all up with
tta major roach problem.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttThat's disgusting.  Okay, I'll fix
ttus a sandwich.  Where are you now?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttJust in a phone booth.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttHow come?  The caller ID says
ttyou're on your cellular.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOh yeah, I am.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttBut you're also in some phone
ttbooth?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttExplain that one, Stu.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI only stepped in because the
tttraffic was so loud outside.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttWell just hurry on back.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTell her you can't.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNot for a few minutes.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttAre you sure you're alone?  I hear
ttsomebody in the background.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThe guy in the next booth.  He's
ttgot a bad connection and he's
tthollering his fool head off.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou've got an answer for
tteverything.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI love you, baby.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttDo you?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou know that.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttStu -- who was that man?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat man?

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttSome person who phoned fifteen
ttminutes ago -- just after you went
ttout.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI don't understand...

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttThis total stranger rang up and
tttold me to wait by the phone --
ttbecause you'd be calling me in a
ttfew minutes -- from a booth.  And I
ttsaid what would he be doing in any
ttphone booth?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAnd what did this guy say?

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttHe said you'd be making phone
ttcalls.  What else?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttMaking calls is part of my
ttbusiness.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttTo whom?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttClients.  People.  Planting items
ttlike I do.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttWomen?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOnce in a while one of them could
ttbe a woman.  I just called
tt"Elaine's" and talked to her to see
ttwho was in there last night.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttYou know exactly what I mean.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou're not going to start that shit
ttagain?

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttI just feel something is wrong.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat could be wrong?

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttThe way you sound.  You don't sound
ttlike yourself.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYeah?  Who do I sound like?

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttSomeone who's scared.  There's fear
ttin your voice like I've never heard
ttbefore.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttSee, Stu?  Kelly agrees with me.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttI want you to come back home.  Now!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI told you.  In a while.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttNo.  I want you here now.  In case
tthe calls back, I don't want to
ttanswer again.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy should he call back?

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttI feel like he's going to.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou're the one that sounds
ttfrightened.  And of nobody.

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttHe's not a nobody.  He knows about
ttus.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou're not telling me all he said. 
ttWhat are you holding back?

<b>ttttKELLY'S VOICE
</b>ttI can't discuss it on the phone. 
ttJust get over here!

tCLICK!  She hangs up.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into pay phone)
ttWhy did you do that to her?  She
ttnever did you any harm.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHow would you know?  Everybody does
ttharm to somebody.  And then they
tttry their best to forget it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttMaybe me -- but not her.  Whatever
ttI've done, there's no reason to
tttake it out on her.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttSuppose that's the only way I can
ttget to you?  You claim you love
tther.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYeah, I do.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou don't even love yourself.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttBut Kelly... I would never hurt.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStill you have to uphold your
ttstatus as an honorary asshole.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttListen, I've treated all my women
ttdecent.  I never laid a hand on any
ttof them, even when provoked.  And I
ttalways let them down easy.
ttt(beat)
ttI'm not ready to let Kelly go. 
ttMaybe I never will be.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhat if she dumps you first? 
ttWhat's the odds she's already taken
ttup with somebody?  One day soon
ttyou'll come home and find her gone
ttalong with the CD player and the
<b>ttVCR.
</b>
<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm not gonna let you mind-fuck me
ttall day!  That's it.  This call is
ttended.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttNot until I say it is.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat happens if I hang up?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou don't really want to find out.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm dying to hear this!!!  What the
ttfuck can you do about it -- up in
ttyour fucking high window with your
ttgoddam binoculars?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI never indicated I had binoculars. 
ttI said I had a highly magnified
tttelescopic image of you that
ttbrought you up so close I could see
ttwhere you nicked yourself under the
ttchin shaving this morning.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOh -- while you're at it, have a
ttlook up my ass.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI may very well do that, Stu.  In
ttthe meantime, think about what kind
ttof device has a telescopic sight
ttmounted on it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat?  You mean... like a rifle?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttA high-powered .30 calibre bolt
ttaction Remington 700 with a carbon
ttone modification and a state of the
ttart Henzholdt tactical sniperscope. 
ttAnd you're in the cross hairs, Stu.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm supposed to believe that?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThere's only one way I can prove it
ttto you.  Hang up the receiver and
ttfind out.  At this range, the exit
ttwound ought to be about the size of
tta small tangerine.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAnd you're just going to kill me
ttfor no reason?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttFor plenty of reasons!  Because you
tthung up.  For years I hated people
tthanging up on me.  Ex-girlfriends. 
ttWomen I didn't even know. 
ttProspective employers.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI get hung up on all the time.  You
ttget used to it.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOr else you don't.  I worked for
ttmonths getting people to switch to
ttMCI -- being insulted at and being
tthung up on hundreds of times a day. 
ttThe ones that cursed me out for
ttinvading their privacy never
ttbothered me as much as those that
ttclicked off without even bothering
ttto reply.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThen why didn't you go after one of
ttthem?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttMaybe you are one of them.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHey, I have worked in a boiler room
ttmyself peddling "Term Life."  I
ttWould never be rude to a fellow
ttsalesperson.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttCan you feel it on you now?  The
ttheat of it.  I'm moving the strike
ttzone down to your stomach area. 
ttNow I'm raising it up again. 
ttDirectly above the chest cavity --
ttsliding up to the forehead just
ttabove the left ear.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttShit -- I do feel it.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTell me where I'm going with it
ttnow.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAcross my forehead -- now back
ttwhere it was before.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'm amazed how you can do that. 
ttYou're amazingly accurate.
ttt(beat)
ttNow I know what you're thinking. 
ttIf I drop down on the floor of the
ttbooth and flatten myself out...

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo, I'm not thinking that.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOh yes you are.  Can I crawl out
ttusing the booth as a shield?  Can I
ttcrawl to that Chrysler illegally
ttparked only three or four feet
ttaway?  The shattering glass may cut
ttme, but it'll only be superficial. 
ttOtherwise, this lunatic will never
ttlet me out alive.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo.  You will.  I know you will. 
ttIf I just cooperate.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhere is it now?  Think and feel
ttfor the warm spot.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttBelow the shoulder?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhich one?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThe right shoulder.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttRemarkable how we're in tune. 
ttYou're doing far better than the
ttothers.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat others?  What do you mean?
ttt(no reply)
ttYou said 'others!'

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttt(finally)
ttI'm sure you read about the Italian
tttourist shot dead ten days ago at
ttthe corner of Forty-fifth and
ttEighth?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI saw it on the news.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAnd where are we now?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOh, God.  Forty-fifth and Eighth.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhat else do you remember about
ttthat killing?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTry.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHe was gunned down.  And nobody was
ttcaught.  And they didn't even
ttbother to take his wallet or his
ttwatch... or anything.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttNow you know why.  It wasn't a
ttrobbery.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat did he do?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHe hung up -- so I disconnected him
ttpermanently.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttPlease -- don't do it to me.  You
ttgot no reason to do it to me.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDon't give me reason.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm not looking to.  Tell me what
ttyou want!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTell me about your job.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat's to tell?  I'm in Public
ttRelations.  They used to call us
tt"flacks."  Now we're media
ttconsultants.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhat do you do, exactly?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttPlant items in the paper and on the
tttube.  More important sometimes,
ttkeep stuff out.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhat've you kept out?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOne of my people got nailed for
ttindecent exposure.  I managed for
ttthe cops to use his real name
ttinstead of his stage name so nobody
ttpicked up on it.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou saved the little deviate's ass,
ttdidn't you?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHe's in major therapy now.  I swear
tthe is.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou must hang with some major
ttcelebrities.  Journalists,
ttnewscasters -- those types.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm real close with Larry King. 
ttAnd the "Hard Copy" people.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttCould you get him down here?  Larry
ttKing?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy would he want to come here?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBecause you asked him to.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHe comes from Atlanta.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWell, who could you get?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWolf Blitzer?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttProbably not.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttRegis?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttDefinitely no chance.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou'd be offering them an exclusive
ttnewsbreak.  I'm talking about more
ttthan one homicide.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHow many?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI don't answer questions.  I ask
ttthem.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI gotta have the facts.  They might
ttnot believe me.  My record isn't
tttoo good when it comes to hard
ttnews.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou're not considered a reliable
ttsource?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOn a divorce or separation, maybe. 
ttOr who's gay, or who isn't gay any
ttmore.  I kind of specialize in that
ttkind of material.  I mean I could
ttprobably get you Joe Franklin.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHow about Cindy Adams?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI might have a shot.  Are you
ttfamiliar with Liz Smith?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDo you know her number?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWant I should call her?  How much
ttcan I say?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTell her you're in direct touch
ttwith a killer who's willing to
ttspeak honestly if she shows up here
ttalone and without notifying the
ttauthorities.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttShe usually likes to have a
ttcelebrity involved.  If you had an
ttactor or a sports figure held
ttprisoner instead of me, there'd be
ttbetter odds she's come.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThen lie.  Pick a celebrity and put
ttthem in the booth.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLet's see.  Who does she like?  Who
ttcouldn't be reached to deny it?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'm anxious to see you in action. 
ttDon't keep me waiting.

tStu uses his cellular again.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(dialing)
ttSometimes you only get her service.
ttt(into cellular)
ttHi -- Stu Shepard.  Put me through. 
ttI've got hard news for her.  I can
ttonly talk to her directly.  But say
ttit regards -- Liza.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttLiza?  That was imaginative.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into cellular)
ttNo, I can't call back.  I'll have
ttto lay in on somebody else. 
ttAlright, but I can't hang on long.
ttt(to pay phone)
ttShe's coming on.
ttt(to cellular)
ttLiz, hello.  Sure I'll make it
ttbrief.  Killing two weeks ago in
ttthe theatre district?  Turn out a
ttsniper did the job.  Yeah, a sniper
ttwith a rifle.  Now he's got another
ttvictim lined up.  Not just your
ttanonymous New Yorker, but Liza. 
ttNow you can't call anybody or Ms. 
ttMinelli's dead meat and so am I. 
ttShe's hostage in a phone booth
ttright in the sniper's sights.  But
tthe says he'll talk to you and let
tther walk.  I know it'll take balls
ttto do this, but you're a fine and
ttcourageous newspaper woman...

tThere's a click.  Silence.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHello?  Hello?
ttt(to pay phone)
ttEither she's on her way over or she
ttdoesn't believe me.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou weren't particularly
ttconvincing.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI didn't really believe in what I
ttwas saying.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBecause you don't really believe my
ttRemington is pointed at you?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI do.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou're ninety percent sure.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAt least ninety-five percent, easy.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttLet me erase all doubt.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo.  Don't shoot.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttControl yourself, Stu.  Glance down
ttat your chest.  What do you see.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOh, my God.  A dot.  A fucking red
ttdot.

tA tiny red dot now moves across Stu's chest.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttLike you've seen in the movies?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThe laser dot.  Just before some
ttpoor bastard always gets blown
ttaway.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttUsually a supporting player.  That
ttlovely but by now generic special
tteffect of the bullet piercing the
ttforehead.

tThe tiny red laser dot dances around Stu's chest and stomach 
t-- the jumps up and remains between his eyes.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThis takes all the guesswork out of
ttit.  You know exactly where to
ttexpect it before I even tighten my
ttfinger on the trigger.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttDon't tighten.  Don't even tickle
ttthat fucking finger.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHow about Geraldo?  He's run his
ttass off to get in on this.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou're talking about the old
ttGeraldo.  Look, I can try and reach
ttcable NBC.  They're hungry.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'm disappointed.  I wanted to go
ttfirst class.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThey do a great job.  They'll haul
tta whole crew over to cover your
ttsurrender "live."

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI never expressed interest in
ttgiving myself up.  There are so
ttmany other phone booths in the
ttcity.  I'm just getting warmed up.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThat's entirely up to you.  Your
ttchoice.  I'm just trying to set you
ttup with the proper communicator.
ttt(beat)
ttI suppose Liza wasn't strong
ttenough.  I should've said Madonna.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttNow you're being creative.

tOutside the booth, the angry black woman has returned,
tbringing with her a gaudily dressed pimp named LEON who looks
tlike he means business.  He slams his fist against the glass,
tnearly shattering it.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttDrag your baggy butt out of that
ttbooth.  We got business to conduct
ttout of there.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttHe been in there all day.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm not through.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttHang up that receiver or I'll make
ttyou eat the fucking thing!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttFuck off or I'll call a cop.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttDo you see one around here?  What
ttyou think I'm gonna be doing while
ttyou're waiting for a prowl car to
ttget assigned?  I'm about to cut you
tta second asshole if you don't
ttvacate those premises.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI can't.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttHe's got him a fucking cellular. 
ttWhat's he need to be on our booth
ttfor?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI can't explain it.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttI'm not interested in your
ttexplanations even if you had any.

tHe withdraws a switchblade knife from his pocket but doesn't
topen it -- yet.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttIf I flick this, I use it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'll make it worth your while to go
ttaway.  How much do you want?

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttMake me an offer.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThirty dollars.  It's all I've got
ttin cash.  Take it and go.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttYou're offering to rent my phone
ttbooth?  For how long?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI don't know.  For as long as it
tttakes.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttWhat's so special in there?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttDo you want the money?

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttIs that a genuine Rolex you've got
tton?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttCome on, man.  That's my good
ttwatch.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttThat's what it's gonna take.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThen here.  Take the damn thing.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttAnd the thirty!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttTake it all.

tThe pimp pockets the watch and the money.  But doesn't go
taway.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttNow I'm satisfied.  But you still
ttgot to deal with Felicia here.  I
ttbelieve you spoke harshly to her.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI apologize.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttAnd did her some injury.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAn accident.  I'm sorry about that,
tttoo.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttThe man don't sound like he means
ttit.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttI agree.
ttt(to Stu)
ttWhy don't you hang up a minute so
ttwe can discuss this matter at
ttlength.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt's long distance.  I can't lose
ttthe call -- I might not get them
ttback.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttDo I have to rip that fucking phone
ttout of there?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThat wouldn't be a good idea.
ttt(into pay phone)
ttWould it?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttNot at all.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI gave you everything I've got.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttThat pinky ring looks attractive. 
ttFelicia might like that.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttIt might fit.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou want the ring, you've got the
ttring.  If I can get it off.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttI can get it off you.

tLeon reaches in and grabs Stu's ring hand.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLet go of me!  It's coming loose. 
ttThere.
ttt(he tosses it)
ttOkay, Felicia, with my deepest
ttapologies.  Goodbye now.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttWhat's really going on in that
ttbooth -- that escapes the naked
tteye?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNothing.  Talk.  That's all.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttThat your connection on the end of
ttthe line?  Or are you dealing?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThis has nothing to do with drugs.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttYou gotta be high on something to
ttwillingly divest yourself of your
ttvaluables -- just to maintain
ttoccupancy of a fucking phone booth
ttthat the local bums piss in every
ttnight.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI knew it smelled for some reason.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttYou look like you're ready to piss
ttyourself.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttBecause I am.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttMaybe if the city provided decent
ttpublic toilets, folks wouldn't
ttrelieve themselves in the subway
ttstations and phone booths!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'll take it up with the mayor.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttNext thing you know you're gonna
ttclaim we mugged you -- took your
ttbillfold and watch.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo, you didn't.  It was a fair and
ttequitable deal.  You had
ttterritorial rights to this booth
ttand I paid a license fee.  Fair is
ttfair.  Now leave me in peace.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttYou sure you're alright?
ttt(to Felicia)
ttHe don't look well.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttKind of pale.  Even for a white
ttman.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttJaundice they calls it.  Probably
ttadvanced liver trouble.
ttt(to Stu)
ttIf it's cirrhosis, you better find
ttyourself a twelve step program and
ttquick.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThanks for your interest but I'm in
ttperfect health.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttSo how come his hand is shaking?

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttThe man is cracking up.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttLookit the sweat pouring off the
ttsonofabitch.  That's one sick
ttmother you started up with, Leon!

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttMe?  You're the one that brought me
ttover and exposed me to all his
ttgerms.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm terminal, okay?  Now can I
ttclose the booth and continue my
ttconversation?

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttI'm worried now it might be
ttcatching.  All that money out of
ttyour sweaty pocket is probably
ttcrawling with some rare and
ttincurable disease.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttFine.  Give it back.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttWhat good's that?  We done touched
ttit.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWell go wash your hands.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttCome on now.  Own up to what you're
ttcarrying.  Is it some of that
ttsexually transmitted shit?  Cause
ttin that case, we can relax.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm sick of you.  Now get out of my
ttface.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttHere we's being solicitous as to
ttyour health and you respond by
ttheaping abuse!

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttWhip his arrogant ass.

tLeon reaches into the booth and grabs Stu's jacket.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttTouch me and I'll throw up on you.

tAt the suggestion, Leon lets go quickly.

tIt looks like a stalemate.  Stu isn't vacating the booth and
tLeon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further.  He
tdoes indeed look sick.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into pay phone)
ttYou can see what I'm up against
tthere.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWant me to get rid of him for you?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat do you have in mind?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'll think of something.

tSuddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp.

tLeon doesn't realize it's there.  The hooker behind him has
tno way of seeing it.  But to Stu, there's no way to miss it. 
tHe reacts.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttGod -- no.
ttt(into pay phone)
ttDon't.  It's not necessary.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou asked for my help.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'll handle it myself.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou're not doing too well.  I can
ttsettle it in a fraction of a
ttsecond.  Shall I demonstrate?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo.
ttt(to Leon)
ttFor your own safety, mister, just
ttwalk away.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttNow the man is turning
ttaggressive... issuing threats upon
ttmy person.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou're making this happen.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttIf you don't hang up and step out,
ttI'm about to topple this booth into
ttthe gutter with you inside it.

tReluctant to touch Stu again, Leon assaults the booth itself. 
tHe begins shaking it violently -- trying to rip it from its
tfoundation.  And the rickety booth is not too sturdy.  It
tstarts rocking back and forth.

tStu is thrown around inside it, barely keeping his footing.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into pay phone)
ttThis isn't my fault.
ttt(shouts)
ttStop that!

tBut Leon continues rocking the booth.  It won't come loose --
tso in frustration, he punches in a side pane of glass.

tThe glass shatters all around Stu, who does his best to
tshield himself from the slivers.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into pay phone)
ttThe guy's insane!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOnly one way to stop a mad dog. 
ttGive me permission.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI can't.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIf he forces you out of that booth,
ttI've told you what to expect.  You
ttor him, Stu.

tLeon is smashing other panes of glass now -- one after
tanother -- as Stu cowers inside.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttDon't cut yourself, honey.

tA crowd of derelicts and street people are now gathering to
twatch the out of control pimp take out his wrath on the booth
tand its occupant.

<b>ttttDERELICT
</b>ttLooks like the fucker is comin'
ttloose.

<b>ttttSTREET PERSON
</b>ttShove it out into the oncoming
tttraffic.

<b>ttttDERELICT
</b>ttWhat'll you bet the bus could knock
ttthat fifty feet?

tThe booth is being decimated but Stu hangs onto the phone.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into pay phone)
ttHello?  Hello?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttt(with heavy static)
ttYou're breaking up.  We're about to
ttbe cut off.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI can't help it!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThat counts as a hang-up.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo.  It can't.  That's not fair.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI can still make him stop.  Say the
ttword.  Can you hear me?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYes.

tStu sees the red dot reappear on Leon's chest as he continues
tto barrage the booth with punches and kicks.

tThen Leon recoils, staggers a step backward.  He doesn't
trealize he's been shot.

tThere's been no sound of gunfire.  Perhaps a silencer was
tused -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary
tdischarge.

tLeon looks confused at first.  His ladyfriend has no idea
the's wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people
twho've assembled on the corner.

tEven Stu isn't sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the
twound on the pimp's chest -- staining his yellow vest.

tHe isn't assaulting the booth anymore.  He's trying to keep
this balance.  He slumps forward, hanging onto the booth for
tsupport -- only a few inches from Stu's face.  The blood runs
tdown the side of the booth.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into pay phone)
ttYou did it!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou said 'yes.'

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI said 'Yes, I can hear you.'  Not
tt'Yes -- kill the motherfucker!'

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDon't try to renege on it.  I was
ttfollowing orders.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou're twisting it all around.  I
ttdidn't do this!

tMeanwhile, Leon leans upright against the booth.  Then his
tlegs cave in and he begins to slide to his knees.

tFelicia runs up beside him.  She sees the blood.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttI warned you not to cut yourself.
ttt(to crowd)
ttLook at all that blood.  He must've
tthit an artery.

tShe screams as Leon topples backwards onto the pavement.  Now
this chest wound is evident.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttOh, Jesus.  What is that?  Talk to
ttme!  What happened?

tThe crowd tightens around the fallen body.  Street people who
tare fascinated but not shocked.

<b>ttttDERELICT
</b>ttGunshot!

<b>ttttSTREET PERSON
</b>ttYeah.  Sucking chest wound right
ttover the heart.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttSomebody call an ambulance.

<b>ttttSTREET PERSON
</b>ttCall the meatwagon.  He's fucked
ttup.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttYou shut the fuck up!

tHer focus turns to Stu in the battered phone booth.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttWhy did you do that to him?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI didn't.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttt(to crowd)
ttYou all saw it!  He shot my man
ttwithout no provocation!

<b>ttttDERELICT
</b>ttYeah.  Pumped one right into him at
ttclose range.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHow could I?  I don't even have a
ttgun.  Look!

<b>ttttSTREET PERSON
</b>ttEverybody get the fuck back!  They
ttshoot one -- then they shoot
tteverybody in sight!  Kill all the
ttfucking witnesses!

tThe crowd disperses to doorways and around the corner -- out
tof immediate range.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttCome back.  You've got to see --
ttI'm not armed.

tOnly Felicia remains, leaning over the pimp's body, staring
thelplessly.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttHang up and dial 911.  Get a
ttdoctor!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI can't hang up.  That's what this
ttis all about.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttYou're gonna stand there and let
tthim die?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(takes out cellular)
ttI can use this.
ttt(he dials)
ttEmergency.  Yes.  There's been a
ttshooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth 
tt-- on the corner.  A man is down. 
ttWhat's the difference who I am?  I
ttdon't want to be involved.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttt(shouts)
ttThat's bullshit.  He's the shooter. 
ttYou're talking to the shooter.

tStu quickly disconnects the cellular.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThat wasn't nice.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttGo ahead -- make a fucking run for
ttit.  I hope they gun you down --
ttlike you did him!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm not going anyplace.  I'm
ttstaying right here in this booth.
ttt(into pay phone)
ttUnless you give me permission.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou're attracting a lot of
ttattention.  I suppose when the
ttpolice get there, you'll accuse me.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat do you expect me to say?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThat's up to you.  But any mention
ttof me will not be appreciated.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou mean...?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou won't even get to finish your
ttsentence.  Oh look, that little red
ttdot is dancing around all over you
ttagain.  You saw how quickly it can
tthappen.  And how accurate I can be.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThey can't blame me -- I'm not
ttarmed.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWho's going to believe that?  With
ttall those witnesses to the
ttcontrary.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThey can see with their own eyes.

tNot far away, we hear the BLAST of POLICE SIRENS drawing
tcloser.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttRemember to leave me out of it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHow can I?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou'll put the proper spin on it. 
ttIsn't that your specialty?  Feeding
ttthe public a story that may not
tthave a shred of truth -- and making
ttit totally believable?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThis isn't a story.  This is real. 
ttThis is murder.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIf you'd only dealt with the man
ttreasonably, shown him some respect,
ttthis might not have been necessary.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI gave him my money, my watch...

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBut not your respect.  Which is
ttwhat he required of you.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHe was a fucking thief.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAnd now he's a fucking dead thief. 
ttDo you feel better about that?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI don't feel a bit guilty.  This is
ttall your doing!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttNow you're being disrespectful of
ttme.  You never learn.  Your job is
ttto deal with people -- but you're
ttnot good at it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHey, I'm not taking any more
ttcriticism from some lunatic sniper
ttwho gets his kicks killing
ttstrangers.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou keep insisting I'm a stranger. 
ttProbably because you don't
ttrecognize the voice.  But there are
ttcheap electronic devices available
ttthat disguise the voice.  I might
ttnot even be a man.  I might be one
ttof those many women you've almost
tttotally forgotten.  One who doesn't
ttforgive easily.  One who wants to
ttwatch you squirm.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou're a man.  I know you're a man. 
ttWomen don't kill with telescopic
ttrifles.  They stab you.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou sound so sure of that.  But
ttyou've never provoked any man as
ttmuch as have the women in your
ttlife.  And so many of them, Stu.
ttt(a beat)
ttDo you even remember their names?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI've got no time to rehash my whole
ttlife.  Oh my God!  The cops are
tthere.

tPolice cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue.

tTraffic has suddenly been shut down.  Prowl cars have now
tblocked the streets.

tPRODUCTION NOTE: Everything is seen from Stu's perspective
twithout intercuts.

tHalf a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns.

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttt(pointing)
ttThat's him -- in the booth.  He's
ttgot a gun!

tAs she hurls accusations, she's lugging Leon's lifeless body
tout into the gutter into the center of Eighth Avenue.

tIt's a bright afternoon.  In the distance, we hear the
tmaddening HONKING of uptown traffic that is now being
trerouted, creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of
tirate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their
tsimplest form of protest.  It's a discordant concert that
techoes the confusion and frustration which Stu now feels...

tAs the cops surround the booth -- at a distance.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttt(into bullhorn)
ttThrow down your weapon and come out
ttwith your hands raised.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttThey're ordering me to come out.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI can see that.  Ignore them.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat if they open fire?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThey probably won't.  Look across
tton the east side of the street.  Do
ttyou see the tourist with the home
ttvideo camera?

<b>tSTU'S POV
</b>
tA distant crowd gathering on the opposite west side corner
tbehind the police cars.  Some tourist is capturing the event
ton video.

<b>tBACK TO STU
</b>
<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat about him?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHe's going to keep the police on
tttheir best behavior.  So long as
ttyou don't take what could be
ttinterpreted as hostile action,
ttyou'll be safe.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou call this safe?  Six cops with
ttguns pointed my way?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou want me to reduce them to three
tt-- or two?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAbsolutely no more shooting.  Now
ttis that clear?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou can always change your mind.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttt(with bullhorn)
ttYou know the drill.  Hands clasped
ttbehind the back of your neck --
ttmoving slowly -- step out of the
ttbooth.  If we see any sign of a
ttweapon, we will respond.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(shouts)
ttYou won't, because there isn't any.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttt(bullhorn)
ttI repeat.  Raise your hands.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI can't.  I'm on a phone call.

tNow a black POLICE CAPTAIN arrives and takes full command of
tthe situation.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN RAMEY
</b>ttYou have thirty seconds to comply.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI told you.  I'm busy.  Come back
ttlater.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttVery good, Stu.

tThe cops take cover behind parked cars, keeping Stu clearly
tin their sights.  He has no place to hide.  He's in the
tbattered phone booth in plain view from all sides.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttYou've been given an order.

tThe Sergeant slides up beside the Captain to confer.

tPRODUCTION NOTE: We remain in LONG SHOT of the cops -- always
tfrom Stu's POV.  But we can hear their voices and all that is
tsaid as if they were in close up.  It has an odd, unreal and
tdistancing effect.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttWe're dealing with a mental case. 
ttHe's looking for us to kill him.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWell he's not getting his wish.

tIn the center of the street, an ambulance pulls up and a team
tof medics jump out.  They rush to Leon's body.  (Again we
thear their voices close, even though visually they are far
toff.)

<b>ttttFELICIA
</b>ttTell me he's gonna be alright.

<b>ttttMEDIC
</b>ttStep aside.  Let us look at him.

tThe medics push her aside -- then examine the victim.  He's
<b>tDOA.
</b>
<b>ttttMEDIC
</b>ttNothing we can do.  Don't touch the
ttbody.  They'll need it to mark the
ttcrime scene.

tFar across the street, the Captain confers with his
tsubordinates.  They are small figures on the screen but we
thear them sharply.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttSame corner as two weeks ago.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttMaybe it's more than a coincidence. 
ttCover me.  I need to talk to him.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttYou've got your vest on?

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWhat do you think?

tThe Captain steps out of cover and boldly approaches the
tphone booth.  He stops cautiously about fifteen feet away.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttI'm not armed.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNeither am I.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttYeah, sure.  I need to know what
tthappened.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttCan't talk about it.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttSure you can.  My name's Ramey. 
ttCaptain Ed Ramey.  What's yours?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLook, I don't want to be friends.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttYou look like you need a friend.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTell him you've already got a
ttfriend.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(yells)
ttI've got a friend, okay.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttIs that who you're talking to on
ttthe phone?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNone of your business.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWhen somebody gets shot, it becomes
ttmy business.  Let's not have
ttanybody else killed.  I want to
tthear your side of it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI've got no side of it.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDon't worry, Stu.  I've got him
ttfixed right in my sights.  I won't
ttlet him hurt you.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttHas this happened to you before? 
ttThe need to hurt someone?  To put a
ttbullet in them?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou won't believe anything I say.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttTry me.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI couldn't shoot anybody.  I'm not
ttarmed.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttYou're right.  I don't believe you. 
ttWhat's that bulge in your pants
ttpocket?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThat?  That's my cellular.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttA cellular?  Then what are you
ttdoing in a phone booth making
ttcalls?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttDo you want to see it?

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttDon't reach for it, mister.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThen how can I show it to you?

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttI don't need to see it.  I know
ttwhat's there.  All these witnesses
ttsaw you use it on him.

tFrom behind a parked car, a HOMELESS PERSON calls out.

<b>ttttSTREET PERSON
</b>ttt(hollers)
ttDamn straight!

tAnother DERELICT, crouched in a doorway, joins in.

<b>ttttDERELICT
</b>ttt(shouts)
ttYeah!  Shot him down like a dog!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThey're all lying.  Nobody saw it
ttbecause it didn't happen.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttA man is dead but it didn't happen.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNot on account of me!  This is like
ttsome bad dream.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttYou're walking through a bad dream
ttand you can't wake up.  Do you want
ttto wake up?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm trying.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttAnd in this dream, you killed that
ttman.  He was bothering you so you
tticed him.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttThen who did?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDon't tell him, Stu.  Or it'll be
ttthe last thing he ever hears.  His
ttblood will be on your hands.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(to Ramey)
ttI don't know.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttBut you saw it happen?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttYou were the closest one to him. 
ttYou must've seen who did it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWe're trying to be honest with each
ttother, aren't we?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNot necessarily.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'm losing patience with this cop.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into phone)
ttI'm handling this.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWho do you keep talking to on the
ttphone?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNobody.  My psychiatrist.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttExcellent, Stu.  You're getting
ttgood at this.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWhat's this doctor's name?  It's
ttimportant we know.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHe says not to tell you.  It's
ttprivileged information.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDamn good reply.  Now you're having
ttfun.  Admit it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhatever you say.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttPlaying it so close to the edge. 
ttI'll bet you've never felt so
ttalive.  That's how I feel when I
ttlook through the sight and select
ttsomebody.

tThe Captain begins advancing a few steps closer.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttI respect your right to privacy. 
ttI've been to therapy myself.  The
ttdepartment provides it.  I know
ttit's not good form for a cop to be
ttadmitting that, but...

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTell him not to come any closer.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttStop right there.  Back up a few
ttsteps.  Back where you were.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttIf it makes you more comfortable.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTell him to read you your rights.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI want you to read me my rights and
ttstop asking questions.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttAl least tell me your first name.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt's my right not to have any name.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttNo gun and no name.  You're a
tthighly underprivileged person.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDemand a lawyer.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAnd get me a lawyer, too.  I want a
ttlawyer brought down here to
ttnegotiate my surrender.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBrilliant, Stu.  Keep winging it.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttIt'll be hard to find a lawyer
ttwilling to risk his life.  But if
ttyou hand over the gun...

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHow can I when you won't let me
tttake it out?

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWe'll take it out for you -- as
ttsoon as you exit the booth with
ttyour hands raised and...

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(interrupts)
ttNow we're back to that again.  It's
ttalways "Get out of the booth.' 
tt'You can't stay in the booth.' 
ttWell, I like it in the fucking
ttbooth.  It's my whole world now. 
ttIt's my booth and I'm never coming
ttout.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWe're not about to force you
ttbecause there could be a
ttmiscalculation and then we'd never
ttfind out why this happened.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy is it so important to know? 
ttThe guy is dead.  Isn't that
ttenough?  Knowing isn't going to
ttmake him alive again.  So who gives
tta fuck!

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttIt's what makes the job
ttinteresting.  Finding out why. 
ttSomething drove you to do this. 
ttYou didn't go out today expecting
ttthis to happen.  It was a nice day. 
ttYou were out for a walk.  And then
ttsuddenly it all changed.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAll I wanted was to make a phone
ttcall.  One lousy phone call for
ttthirty-five fucking cents.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttCareful, Stu.  Don't volunteer too
ttmuch.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttYou got some bad news on that call.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThe worst.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttSomething that pushed you over the
ttedge?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAnd I've been falling ever since.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttTime to land.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhen you hit bottom, you die.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttI'm your safety net.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIf I tell you what you want to know
tt-- you'll die, too.

tSomething about the implied threat sends a chill through
tCaptain Ramey.

<b>tINSERT SHOT
</b>
tThe Captain's head as seen through a telescopic sight.

tRamey could be dead in an instant.

tPRODUCTION NOTE: The only time we deviate from Stu's
tperspective is when we see the sniper's POV through his
tscope.

<b>tANGLE BACK ON STU IN THE BOOTH,
</b>
tthe detective fifteen feet away.

tRamey decides to back off momentarily.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttI'll go see about that lawyer.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNow that's a good idea.

tThe Captain withdraws back across the street.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHe's lucky.  I had him centered in
ttmy cross hairs.  I really had to
ttrestrain myself.

tWe hear the approach of a helicopter.

tStu peers up ward as not one but two choppers appear above
tthe tall buildings.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIt's not the police.  It's the
ttmedia.  You're news, Stuart.

tThe helicopters circle above.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou've never gotten this much press
ttfor any of your clients.  I'm
ttmaking you a famous person.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThey're just hoping for coverage of
ttme dying in the gutter.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTheir presence is putting the
ttpolice on their continued best
ttbehavior.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThose cops are just looking for any
ttexcuse.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThen don't give them one.

tThen, as if on cue, Stu's cellular phone in his pocket starts
tringing.

tBut he can't allows himself to reach for it.  To do so might
tcause the police to believe he was trying to draw his gun.

tIt rings quietly -- virtually inaudible outside the booth. 
tDrowned out by the traffic horns, the static from the police
tradios and the newly introduced sound of television
thelicopters circling over Eighth Avenue taking video coverage
tof the event below.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWho could it be?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttKelly.  She was worried about me.

tStu is afraid to reach in his pocket lest the cops think he's
tgoing for a gun.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttMaybe she's seen this on
tttelevision.  It must be on every
ttchannel by now.  Breaking news.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttShe doesn't watch daytime TV.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOne of the neighbors could've
ttalerted her.

tThe cell phone keeps ringing, almost drowned out by the sound
tof helicopters circling overhead.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy are you saying this?  You want
ttme to reach in my pocket so you can
ttsee them open fire?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThat's an unwarranted accusation
ttand very unbecoming in light of the
ttgood advice I've given in the past. 
ttHave I ever steered you wrong?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttGod -- how I'd love to hear her
ttvoice.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIt might even be worth it.  She's
ttinsistent, isn't she?

tThe cellular won't stop ringing.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIf she knows I'm in trouble, she
ttwon't give up.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttProbably glued to the TV by now. 
ttI'm watching coverage on two
ttstations now.  Channel surfing.
ttt(pause)
ttWell, there you are on two and four
ttand five.  Not any decent angles on
ttyou, though, stuck inside there.

tThe cell phone continues beeping until the sound of it is
tmaddening.  Stu is still afraid to reach for it and provide
tthe cops with an excuse to open fire.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBut if you'd take one or two steps
ttoutside and look up, I think they
ttcould get a clear picture of you.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou said I'm not allowed to leave
ttthe booth.

tFinally the cell phone stops ringing.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI might be willing to bend the
ttrules and let you enjoy your moment
ttof fame.  Set the phone down
ttwithout hanging up... and take a
ttstep or two outside.  Just for a
ttminute.  Then come straight back in
ttor I'll be forced to provide 'live'
ttcoverage that should rival the
tthistoric Zapruder footage.
ttt(beat)
ttNothing like an exploding head to
ttexcite viewer interest.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo, thanks.  I'll stay where I am.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIt was only a suggestion.  Since
ttyou're convinced I'm going to plug
ttyou anyway, it can't matter much.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIf you shoot me, you give yourself
ttaway.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttEven without a muffler, they'd
ttnever hear the report with all this
ttnoise.  Afterwards, it'd take them
tta good ten minutes to realize you
ttweren't plugged by some overzealous
ttofficer.  Then they'll blame the
ttmedia for inciting a crackpot
ttvigilante to come down here and do
ttthe SWAT team's job for them.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou expected them to come.  You had
ttthis all worked out.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI write the scenario and you all
ttplay your parts -- as directed.

tThe damned cell phone starts beeping again.  Stu fights the
ttemptation to grab for it and hear Kelly's voice for one last
ttime.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttPoor Kelly.  What she must be going
ttthrough.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhy don't you tell her how you feel
ttabout her?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'd never get the words out.  Not
ttwith fifteen or twenty rounds in
ttme.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou can't be certain they'd fire. 
ttThey'd see it was only a phone.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThey wouldn't wait to see.

tThe cellular ringing continues jangling Stu's nerves.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy doesn't she hang up?

tThen Stu notices something in the crowd gathering far across
tthe street behind the police barricades.  Countless faces
trubbernecking, probably hoping to see some display of
tviolence that would end with him face down dead on the
tpavement.

tAnd in the midst of them -- one face familiar to him.  A
tfemale, quite pretty... even in tears.  It's Kelly.  (We see
ther only in LONG SHOT -- a distant figure in bright green
tjacket that makes her stand out from the crowd.)

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt's her!  She's not calling me. 
ttShe's over there.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIs she?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThe blonde girl in the green
ttjacket.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttCan't miss her.  Very attractive,
ttisn't she?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttShe must've heard all the commotion
ttand come downstairs.

tThe cellular is still ringing.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt's somebody else who knows my
ttcell number.
ttt(beat)
ttIt's you!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou continue to impress.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy is it so important that they
ttkill me?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBecause that's how I win.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThis time you won't.  If you want
ttme dead, you'll have to do it
ttyourself.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttEither way I can't lose.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt's all a game to you -- because
ttyou're incapable of feelings. 
ttYou're not even human.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI pride myself on that.  What's so
ttgreat about being human?  It's the
ttlowest form of life on this planet
ttand I've taken it upon myself to
ttthin the herd.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI quit.  I'm not answering back any
ttmore.  I won't hang up but I'm not
ttplaying.

tThere's silence now between them.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStu?  Stu, don't be that way. 
ttYou're taking the pleasure out of
ttit.

tStu doesn't take the bait.  He remains absolutely silent.

tA stalemate has been reached.

<b>tWE RACK FOCUS ACROSS THE STREET TO THE POLICE
</b>
tclustered behind an emergency vehicle.  The Sergeant brings a
tcivilian to meet Captain Ramey of the SWAT unit.  The
tnewcomer wears coveralls stenciled "AT&T."  (Although they
tare very far away, we hear their voices close up as they come
tinto sharper focus.)

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttThis here's Helfand, of New York
ttTelephone.

<b>ttttHELFAND
</b>ttGlad to help out.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttHave you got the number of that
ttbooth?

<b>ttttHELFAND
</b>ttSure do.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttCan you tap into that call?

<b>ttttHELFAND
</b>ttIt can be done.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttBut not without a warrant.  You
ttcould be violating this psycho's
ttcivil rights.  Especially if he's
tton the line with his fucking

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttShit.  I don't want to blow this on
tta technicality.  Tracing the call
ttisn't any violation, is it?

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttAs long as we don't listen in.

tWe remain in LONG SHOT of the POLICE as they continue in
theated conversation.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttt(to Helfand)
ttOkay, we've got to know who he's
tttalking to and their current

<b>ttttHELFAND
</b>ttThat I can handle.  As long as they
ttkeep the circuit open.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttI need the number and an address to
ttgo with it.

tHelfand rushes off.  At the corner, we can glimpse him
tentering a phone company utility truck parked on Forty-Fifth
tStreet.

<b>tRACK FOCUS BACK TO PHONE BOOTH
</b>
tStu remains tight lipped and silent, refusing to give his
ttormentor the conversation he so craves.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStuart, my friend.  Do you want to
ttsee how close I can come without
ttactually hitting you?

tStu resists pleading because he knows his silence is more
tpowerful.

tThere's no glass in the left side of the booth since the late
tLeon smashed it all out.

tNothing to shatter when the sniper squeezes off his shot.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttMay I call attention to the yellow
ttpages?

tThe frayed yellow phonebook dangling from a chain under the
ttelephone shudders under the impact of a direct hit.

tThere's been no sound of a gunshot, but the damage is there
tto behold.

tStu reaches for the phonebook.

tThere's a bullet hole straight through it.  Pieces of the .30
tcalibre slug have shattered into many tiny fragments and are
timbedded between the pages, half-way through the thick
tvolume.

tStu pries pieces out of the pages of the directory.  He looks
tat them in the palm of his hand.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHollow points are designed to break
ttup on impact.  It would've behaved
ttdifferently if it had pierced your
ttsoft flesh.  The pieces would've
ttbounced around looking for a way
ttout.  That's where the real damage
ttoccurs -- finding an exit --
ttdeflecting off all that bone...

tStu wants to shout "STOP," but restrains himself.  Not
ttalking gives him some degree of power.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStill the silent treatment?  My
ttfather used to dish that out when
tthe chose to punish me.  Not a word
ttspoken -- one time for over a
ttmonth.  I'd try and goad him to
ttacknowledge I existed, but he
ttstared right through me.  You're
ttbringing back unhappy childhood,
ttStu.  That's not wise.

tStu still declines to answer.  His silence seems his only
tweapon.  He tosses the bullet fragments out of the booth onto
tthe pavement.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttSince you're ignoring me, I'll
ttfocus on someone else.
ttt(a beat)
ttThere she is -- nice and sharp.  I
ttcan see the two little punctures in
tteach earlobe and my God, what kind
ttof a girl would have her nostril
ttpierced?

tStu realizes the sniper now has Kelly in his sights.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhat was that?  Louder, Stu.  We
ttmust have a bad connection.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLeave her out of it.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI didn't expect her to show up
tthere.  But since she has -- I'll
ttimprovise.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttDon't.  Please don't.  I'm sorry. 
ttI'm talking to you again.  I'll
tttalk all you want!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIt's a bad dye job.  The black
ttroots are growing in and it makes
tther look cheap.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI've screwed up her life enough
ttalready.  Please don't hurt her.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI don't necessarily have to kill
tther.  I could be persuaded to
ttsettle for a reasonable mutilation.
ttWhich part of her displeases you
ttmost?  If she turns a bit more in
ttprofile, I'm accurate enough to
ttremove the tip of her unpleasantly

thalf leaning out of the booth, staring at his wife and the
tcops in the distance.

<b>tRACK FOCUS TO THEM --
</b>
tand suddenly we can hear them clearly in spite of the
tdistance.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttWhat do you mean psychiatrist?  He
ttdoesn't see any psychiatrist.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttThen who'd your husband be talking
ttto?

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttThere was some guy that called the
tthouse this morning and said weird
ttstuff to me.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttStu seems to be checking things out
ttwith this person.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttHe hasn't got many friends -- I can
tttell you that.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttRemain here, please.  We may need
ttyou later.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttYou won't hurt him?

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWe'll do our best not to.

tKelly is left alone as the Captain returns to their command
tcenter.

tKelly is once again a solitary target.  She could be picked
toff without attracting undue attention.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttShe won't even feel it when it
tthappens.

<b>tBACK TO PHONE BOOTH
</b>
<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttTake me instead.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDon't distract me.  Now's the time
ttto be absolutely still.  I have to
tthold my breath as I squeeze
ttgently --

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo!  I'm hanging up.  That's it.

tStu hangs up the receiver.  He disconnects.

<b>tRACK FOCUS TO LONG SHOT --
</b>
tThe police as they react.  We see a flurry of activity across
tthe street.  Voices become clear as focus shifts.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttShit.  He hung up.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttMaybe they already traced it. 
ttAnyhow, it doesn't matter.  Looks
ttlike he's coming out.

<b>tRACK FOCUS BACK TO STU --
</b>
tslowly stepping out of the booth.  His hands are raised.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(shouts)
ttI've giving myself up.  Take me!

<b>ttttSWAT OFFICER
</b>ttt(distant)
ttFirst the gun.  We want to see you
tttoss away your weapon!

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttShit.  I can't.

<b>ttttSWAT OFFICER
</b>ttt(distant)
ttFreeze where you are!  Turn around
ttand keep those hands clasped.
ttt(signals the others)
ttTake him.

tThe SWAT OFFICERS in protective gear now step out of cover
tand fan out as they approach the booth.

<b>tTIGHTER ON STU
</b>
tHe's just outside the booth -- expecting to feel the sniper's
tbullet go through him at any moment.

tThen the pay phone starts ringing.

tThe sniper is calling back.

<b>tRACK FOCUS AGAIN
</b>
tto the police.

tAll the cops react.  Particularly the Captain and the
tSergeant.  Their voices seem close up when they sharpen in
tfocus.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttWhat is going on with these fucking
ttphone calls?

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttt(shouts)
ttHold your fire.  Let him answer it.

tThe SWAT team backs up but maintain their aim.

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttAre you nuts?

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttLet them talk.  He's not going
ttanywhere.
ttt(shouts)
ttHe's going back inside the booth.

tIndeed we see Stu re-enter the battered phone booth and pick
tup the receiver.

<b>tFOCUS RETURNS TO STU
</b>
<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into pay phone)
ttYeah?

tA strange voice begins chattering away in Spanish.  Totally
tunintelligible to Stu.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into pay phone)
ttYou got the wrong number.  Hang up.

tThe voice, probably a Puerto Rican gentleman, rattles on in
tSpanish.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWrong number.  Wrong number.

tThen the voice on the phone suddenly alters the Hispanic
taccent.  It is the now familiar tone of his tormentor.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAw, relax, Stu.  Only yanking your
ttchain.  Now can we start over?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThose cops won't wait much longer.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhat else can they do?  They can't
ttafford to just shoot you like I
ttcan.  Not with so much media
ttcoverage.  Not unless you make some
ttstupid aggressive move.
ttt(beat)
ttThe ABC Mobile Unit just rolled up.

tAcross the street, Stu can see various TV units from local
tstations setting up cameras on roofs of trucks.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWill you look at that?  I must be
ttgoing out over the network.  Bet
ttthey're pre-empting usual
ttprogramming.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAnd just think -- if you survive
ttthis, your trial will be televised. 
ttAnd you can try and make the world
ttbelieve I ever existed.  I'd be
ttyour only defense.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHow are they gonna prove that I
ttkilled anybody when there's no gun?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThey'll plant one.  The police
ttaren't above that -- when they're
ttdesperate to convict.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo, sir.  No gun and I walk.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDon't you think I took that into
ttaccount?  Am I a fool?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHaven't I considered every
tteventuality?  I knew they'd come
ttand cordon off the block.
ttt(beat)
ttAnd that there'd have to be a gun
ttsomeplace.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhere?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIt's a small booth, Stu.  Have you
ttchecked every inch of it?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(looking up and down)
ttIt's not on the floor.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThen what's left?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttUp above.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttCould be.  Why don't you reach up
ttthere and lift the plastic sheet --
ttand feel around.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIf they see me reach for something,
ttthey could open fire.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThey could.  But you have to know
ttif it's there.  Don't you?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI totally don't give a shit.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIn a narrow space, tucked just to
ttthe left of the fluorescent bulb. 
ttYou can almost see it outlined if
ttyou look closely.

tStu peers upward at the clouded plastic, now stained and
tdirty.  There are shadows of objects above in the shallows
tarea around the light fixture that automatically goes on when
tthe door to the phone booth is tightly closed.

tStu opens and closes the door a few times, watching the light
tclick on -- watching the shadows around the light.

tCould that be an accumulation of dirt, dust, or dead insects? 
tOr could something be stashed up there?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt doesn't matter.  I know about
ttballistics.  The slug in that dead
ttguy came from your rifle, not any
tthandgun.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou saw how hollow points splinter
tton impact.  There's nothing much
ttfor ballistics to match to.  The
ttsame make .30 calibre bullets are
ttin that handgun.  The prosecution
ttrests.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThere's no gun up there.  I don't
ttsee a damn thing.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttSlide your finger up under the
ttplastic and you'll feel the cold
ttmetal surface.  There are four
ttrounds left in it.  Should you
ttdecide to shoot your way out.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI could never shoot anybody.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou could shoot me, Stu.  You'd do
ttthat in a minute if you could.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAnd I'd fucking love it!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttNow you're speaking from the heart. 
ttCome on, just lift the partition a
ttfew inches and feel what's there
ttfor you.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm not getting my fingerprints on
ttyour fucking weapon.  What about
ttpowder residue?  How are they going
ttto explain that to a jury?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDo you think that'll matter with so
ttmany eye witnesses?
ttt(beat)
ttDo it... or should I re-focus my
ttattention on Kelly?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou carefully distracted me from
tther before and I let you get away
ttwith it.  But if you're not going
ttto play fairly --
ttt(a pause)
ttThere she is again.  So close I
ttfeel like I could touch her.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttGet off her!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThen mind me when I speak.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLook!  I'm reaching up with my left
tthand.  I'm pushing against the
ttpartition.  It's giving.  I'm
ttfeeling around with my fingertips. 
ttIt's filthy up there.

<b>tTIGHT SHOT - STU'S FINGERS
</b>
tfeel about inside the shallow space.  The shriveled remains
tof dead flies -- a layer of dust -- and then a .30 handgun.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm -- touching something.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOne of the finest handguns
ttRemington makes.  Lightweight,
ttefficient and highly accurate.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm not picking it up.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttNot right now.  But eventually...

tStu lowers his hand, still empty.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI wouldn't have a chance.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI never said you would.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm not insane.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBut you're getting there.  It
ttwouldn't take much.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThat won't happen.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou could pull the gun down, shove
ttit in your own mouth and jerk the
tttrigger.  That's another option.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhy would I do that?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttTo please me.  And ensure that
ttnothing happens to Kelly.  I don't
ttnecessarily have to deal with her
tttoday in the midst of a crowd of
ttcops.  I can take her out any time
ttI like.  When she goes to pull down
tther blinds at night or when she
ttwalks the dog first thing in the
ttmorning.  What is it -- a Jack
ttRussell?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttOkay.  I know you can do it.  But
ttdon't talk about that.  Please.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'd rather see you remembered as
ttthe gallant gunman who tried to
ttshoot his way past an army of
ttpolice -- than as a coward who
ttsucked the barrel.  I'm doing your
ttPR for you.  Creating a final image
ttthat'll endure.  The outraged New
ttYorker who was pushed too far. 
ttWhen some lowlife street person
tttries to invade his territory, he
ttretaliated.  And when the forces of
ttthe law closed in, he was
ttdefiant... to the end.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttLike that nerdy sonofabitch who
ttblew those three wiseass kids away
tton the subway?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttExactly.  Nobody minded that he was
tta sicko.  He was living out a New
ttYorker's pet fantasy.  Can you
ttremember that movie where Peter
ttFinch started screaming 'I'm not
tttaking it anymore!'  And everybody
ttpicked up on it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>tt'I'm mad as hell and I'm not taking
ttit anymore.'

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThat was it.  Poor Finch got
tthimself an Oscar for that.  But he
ttwas dead by then.  I mean he really
ttdied.  Maybe playing that part took
tttoo much out of him.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(softly to himself)
tt'I'm not taking it anymore.'  'I'm
ttnot taking it anymore.'

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThat's the way!  Psyche yourself
ttup.  Everybody respects a man who
ttfights back, even if he goes a
ttlittle berserk in the process.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttFighting back.  That's what it's
ttabout.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttExactly!  We all understand the
ttpoor schmuck that gets laid off and
ttcomes back and shoots all his
ttbosses.  We all thought of doing
ttthat.  But only he had the balls. 
ttThe terminally ill husband who gets
tthis policy canceled and machine
ttguns the insurance company offices. 
ttMaybe somebody will finally get the
ttmessage.  You can fuck human beings
ttover only for so long before they
ttcome back at you.  I'm still
ttholding on Kelly and she looks very
ttconcerned.  I could relieve all
ttthat anguish in a fraction of a
ttsecond.  Shall I?

tStu is hearing these words but thinking only of what the man
ton the line has done to him.  His turn has come to fight
tback.  He has an idea.

tIf the sniper is focused on Kelly, he can't be watching Stu.

tTurning his back to the police, Stu slowly sinks to his
tknees.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm on my knees begging you.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStand up, Stu.  You're embarrassing
ttyourself.

<b>tTIGHT ANGLE --
</b>
tStu now down on his knees in the booth.  He's curled up
talmost into a fetal position.

tBy doing so, he hopes to hide the fact that he's reaching
tinto his pants pocket and pulling out his cellular phone.

tHe half expects to hear a shot ring out either from the
tsniper or the cops.  But nothing happens.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStu -- I want you back on your feet
ttfacing me.  So you can see what I'm
ttgoing to do to her.

tStu ignores the command.  He's quickly dialing.

<b>t911.
</b>
tHe's calling police emergency.

<b>tSNIPER'S POV
</b>
tStu seen through the cross hairs of the sniperscope,
tcrouched, doubled up at the foot of the booth.  But the cell
tphone is hidden in front of him.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBe a man, Stuart.  Don't let them
ttsee you like this.  You're an
ttembarrassment to me.

<b>tWIDER SHOT - THE BOOTH
</b>
twith Stu still kneeling.

<b>tRACK FOCUS
</b>
tto police across the street as their voices become clear --

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttt(listening to
ttttransmission)
ttOfficer on east side of the street
ttreports subject removed a dark
ttmetallic object from his pocket. 
ttWe better move.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttHold all fire until you actually
ttidentify a weapon.  We're doing
ttthis on fucking TV!

<b>tRACK FOCUS BACK TO -- STU IN THE BOOTH
</b>
tcrouched forward.  The pay phone receiver dangles just above
this head.  The cellular remains cupped in his hand.

tStu never lifts the cell phone.  He keeps the palm of his
thand over the speaker of the phone to muffle any sound from
tthe other end.

tIt rings and finally someone answers.

<b>ttttEMERGENCY OPERATOR
</b>ttt(faint)
ttPolice.  Is this an emergency? 
ttHello?  Is someone on the line?

tBut Stu addresses himself loudly to the pay phone which he
tnow grips in his other hand.  Hoping that his words will be
tpicked up by the emergency operator listening via the
tcellular.  To help in this regard, he reaches back and slides
tthe door to the booth tightly closed.

tHe pretends to be talking to the sniper but his words are
tmeant for the 911 operator to hear.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(loud)
ttYou've made your point.  Who's
ttgoing to believe I've got a sniper
ttwith a telescopic sight holding me
ttin a fucking phone booth at 45th
ttand 8th?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttIt took you a while to believe it
ttyourself.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIf you'd put a bullet in that
ttCaptain Ramey, it would've been a
ttdifferent story -- but you were too
ttwise to do that.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhy don't you do it for me?  Wave
ttthe old captain back over and get
tthim nice and close and then use the
tthandgun on him.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(talking loud)
ttWhy me?  You could pick off any of
ttthose cops from your window up
ttthere.  Like you did that pimp. 
ttAnd that tourist last week.  But
ttthis time you want me to do your
ttkilling for you.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAnd you will!  To save Kelly.

<b>tEXTREME TIGHT SHOT - CELL PHONE
</b>
tcupped in Stu's hand and held low.  Can they hear him on the
tother end?

<b>ttttEMERGENCY OPERATOR
</b>ttt(muffled, almost
tttinaudible)
ttCan you speak up, sir?  What is
ttyour name?

tStu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the
temergency operator.  He sets the cell phone down flat on the
tfloor of the booth facing upward.  He puts his foot over the
treceiving end to muffle the incoming voice.  Then he stands
tup.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThat's better, Stu.  Now turn
ttaround so I can see you.

tStu talks close into the pay phone receiver now.  But keeps
this voice raised.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThis booth.  It's my whole world --
ttshrunk down to four feet by three
ttfeet.  Not much bigger than the
ttsize of a coffin.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThey can put handles on the booth
ttand bury you in it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(loudly into pay phone)
ttWhen I saw you put that bullet into
ttthat black dude, I knew you'd never
ttlet me out of this phone booth
ttalive.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou're wasting my time.  Reach up
ttand take the gun.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(peering upward,
tttsquinting)
ttLet me see you first.  What harm
ttcan that do you?  You're in one of
ttthose windows.  I've got to know
ttwhich one.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttNo need for that.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttBeing so far, I could never
ttidentify you.  I don't even want
ttto.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhat is it then?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttDon't worry that I'd try to point
ttyou out.  You'd shut me up with one
ttof your .30 calibre hollow points
ttbefore I could even raise a finger.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhy does it matter so much?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI want to see that you exist.  Like
ttGod exists.  It's not enough to
ttbelieve.  You want to see him --
ttjust once -- even at a distance.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAnd then you'd take the gun down. 
ttAnd use it.  We have a deal on
ttthat?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttShow yourself to me and I'll take
ttthe gun down.  I swear.

tThere's a pause as the sniper mulls it over.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI don't have to make deals.  And
ttyou're irritating me by trying to
ttnegotiate.  God doesn't have to
ttprove anything.  He just strikes
ttyou down when he gets in the mood.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttStop!  I won't ask to see you
ttanymore.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'm glad that's settled.  But look
ttwho else has showed up?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWho?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI guess she saw the coverage on TV
ttand just couldn't keep away.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThe 'hotel' just arrived.  And a
ttvery beautiful little hotel she is. 
ttActually, I'd classify her as more
ttof a motel.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttMavis?  I don't see her.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttShe's too far back behind the
ttpolice line.  But I've got a fine
ttshot at her from up here.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou don't even know what she looks
ttlike.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou're in an enviable position now,
ttStu.  You get to choose between
ttthem.  Tell me which one.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI can't.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhich will it be?  Kelly or Mavis? 
ttOr should I simply select one?

<b>tINSERT SHOT - THE CELL PHONE
</b>
tlying face up on the floor of the booth.  Is anybody
tlistening?

<b>tBACK TO STU
</b>
tStu looks down at the cellular.  He has no way of knowing if
tthe police operator can hear any of his words.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI need time to think...

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou've got to be more in touch with
ttyour feelings.  You said you love
ttKelly.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI do.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThen I'm doing you a favor putting
ttyou out of the way of temptation.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt wasn't Mavis' fault.  It was all
ttmy fault.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThen take the third option.  Reach
ttabove you and pick up the gun.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttYou'll leave them both alone?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThere won't be much point in
ttharming them without you around to
ttimpress.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'll do it.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttLet me see you do it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI need one minute.  One last
ttminute, please.  Can you give me
ttthat?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDon't tell me you're going to say
ttyour prayers?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttSomething like that.

<b>tWE RACK FOCUS AWAY TO LONG SHOT - THE POLICE

<b>ttttSERGEANT
</b>ttt(listening on transmitter)
ttThere's something else coming in. 
ttA 911 operator says your name was

tton the line.  Somebody talking
ttabout a phone booth.  And a sniper.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttPatch me through.  Hello, this is

<b>ttttEMERGENCY OPERATOR
</b>ttThe line is still open.  It's

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWe're there!  Can you play me back

<b>ttttEMERGENCY OPERATOR
</b>ttI can't replay the tape while it's

</b>ttIt's awful faint.  He's not talking

</b>ttSend them in from the Forty-third

</b>ttThe police seem all excited about
ttsomething, Stu.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAre they?  I wasn't looking.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI can't wait any longer.  Say amen,
ttthen reach up for the gun.  When
ttyour hand comes down, I want to see
ttit.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm too afraid.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttFor once, be brave.  Surprise
ttyourself.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'm shaking all over.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttGuys in combat situations even shit
tttheir pants.  But they follow
ttorders.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttAs soon as the cops see a gun,
ttthey'll open fire.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThen I'd advise you to fire first.

tStu's arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower.

tHis fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that
tcover the roof of the booth.  It raises up easily at the
tmiddle where two sheets join.

<b>tTIGHT INSERT SHOT
</b>
tThe space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of
tclouded plastic.  We see the fluorescent lighting fixture
tcovered with dust.  The solitary object -- a cruel-looking
tweapon.

tNow Stu's fingertips protrude into the small space.  He
ttouches the gun, brushes back and forth, feeling the
troughness of the grip.

<b>tTIGHT SHOT - STU'S FACE
</b>
tas below he continues to hesitate -- it's agony --

tThe sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed
ttightly shut.  He can already imagine the police bullets
ttearing into him.

<b>tA POLICE SNIPER IS MOVING INTO POSITION.
</b>
<b>ttttPOLICE SNIPER
</b>ttt(into transmitter)
ttGive me the word.

<b>tRACK BACK TO STU - IN THE BOOTH
</b>
tHis arm still raised.  He hasn't brought it down with the gun
tin it.  Not yet.  He holds the pay phone receiver jammed up
tagainst his mouth.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHard part's over.  Drop your arm
ttand point it like you'd point your
ttfinger and squeeze.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo.  You do it.  If you want me
ttdead, then fucking murder me!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhy must I keep invoking some poor
ttgirl's name every time we come to
ttan impasse?  I'm focused back on
ttKelly again.  You're obviously not
ttwilling to trade your life for
tthers.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI am!  I'm doing it!

tHe pulls the handgun down into full view.  Curiously, the
tpolice do not open fire.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThere!  You see it?  They all see
ttit.

tHe waves the gun so nobody can miss it.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhere are you?  Damn you!!

tHe drops the receiver and steps halfway out of the booth.

tStill the cops do not open fire.

tThen Stu starts shooting.

tNot at the police, but at the high rise buildings across the
tstreet.

tAt the thousands of windows that look down upon him.

tHe gets off two shots before a solitary rifle shot rings out
tin response.

<b>tRACK FOCUS TO THE POLICE SNIPER
</b>
tHe has fired.

<b>tANGLE ON STU
</b>
tThe remaining glass on the south side of the booth shatters. 
tStu tumbles forward, sprawling out of the booth onto the
tpavement.

<b>tRACK FOCUS TO KELLY
</b>
tShe screams, tries to break through but cops restrain her.

<b>tINT.  PHONE BOOTH
</b>
<b>tANGLE ON DANGLING RECEIVER
</b>
tas it sways back and forth.  From it, we hear the voice.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThanks for such an interesting
ttafternoon.

<b>tTHEN THERE ARE OTHER SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE DANGLING
</b><b>tSWAYING PHONE.
</b>
tA wooden door being battered open.  A few incomprehensible
tshouts as a SWAT TEAM dashes in.  Stu's stalling for time has
tpaid off.

<b>tTHE SOUND OF A BARRAGE OF GUNFIRE.
</b>
<b>tTHE SOUND OF A MUFFLED SCREAM.
</b>
tThe police have broken in on Stu's tormentor and there has
tbeen a rapid exchange of shots.

tA HAND reaches into the booth and grabs the receiver.

tANGLE WIDENS as Ramey places it to his ear.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttHello?  This is Captain Ramey. 
ttSomebody talk to me.

<b>ttttSWAT OFFICER'S VOICE
</b>ttYeah.  We took him out, Captain. 
ttNobody else got hurt.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWhat's his condition?

<b>ttttSWAT OFFICER'S VOICE
</b>ttCritical.  The sonofabitch took
tttwo.  Probably won't survive the
ttride.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttGet a statement from him.  I'll be
ttright over.

tHe drops the receiver so that it dangles again.

tCAMERA FOLLOWS RAMEY to where Stu lies surrounded by cops and
tmedics.  He's stunned, but very much alive.

<b>ttttMEDIC
</b>ttDon't try to sit up.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat was that?

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttt(kneeling)
ttRubber bullet.

<b>ttttMEDIC
</b>ttYou'll have one hell of a nasty
ttwelt.  Busted rib.  Maybe a
ttpermanent scar there.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt couldn't hurt much more if you
ttreally shot me.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttSomebody was going to and we
ttthought it may as well be us.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttDid you get him?

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttSure as hell did.  Thanks to you.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttStill alive?

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttBarely.

<b>ttttMEDIC
</b>ttWe'll be giving him a hypo for the
ttpain.  It'll put him out for a
ttwhile.

tKelly is now brought over by a female cop.  She drops to her
tknees beside Stu and tries to embrace him.  The medics
trestrain her.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttIt's okay.  I'm not really shot.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttI was so afraid.  I thought...

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI thought so, too.  But we're going
ttto be alright.  Both of us.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttRemember how you swore up and down
ttyou'd get me on TV?  Well, you did. 
ttI already got interviewed on Fox
ttand Channel Eleven and they even
ttwant me on A.M. America tomorrow
ttmorning.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttBet you didn't think I could
ttdeliver on that.

<b>ttttMEDIC
</b>ttWill you please let go of him,
ttMiss?

tA gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance.  The medic
tis about to administer the hypo but Stu pushes him away.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo.  No hypo.  I want to see him
ttfirst.

tThe medics are now ready to lift Stu onto the gurney and cart
thim off.  But Stu struggles against them.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttRelax.  The guy's dying.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttThat's why I've gotta talk to him. 
ttPlease!

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttWe'll see.

<b>ttttMEDIC
</b>ttt(to Kelly)
ttYou can ride with him in the
ttambulance.

tThe woman cop escorts Kelly to the waiting ambulance.

tRamey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the SWAT team
tinside the hotel.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttThis is Ramey.  Over.  This is
ttRamey.  Ten-Four.

tThere's nothing but static, mixed up feedback and multiple
tgarbled voices on the other end of the line.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttShit.  Get everybody off this
ttwavelength.

tHe crosses back to the phone booth -- picks up the dangling
treceiver.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttHello.  Hello!  Pick up!  Yeah,
ttit's Ramey again.  Can you hold the
ttphone close enough so the perp can
ttlisten?

<b>ttttCOP'S VOICE
</b>ttHe's not saying a word, Captain.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttHe's not about to talk to us. 
ttMaybe to him.

tRamey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift
tStu onto the gurney.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttForget that.  Stand him up.
ttt(to Stu)
ttCan you stand?

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI can try.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttHelp him over here.

tThe medics support Stu and inch him back to the booth.  It's
tpainful, but Stu ignores it.

tRamey holds the phone up so Stu can both listen and speak.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttHere.  Speak up.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(into pay phone)
ttIt's me.  Do you hear me?  Answer
ttme.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttt(wheezing)
ttHad to have the last word, Stu.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI finally beat your ass.  Admit it,
ttyou fuck.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttBut you'll never forget me.  I gave
ttyou the most thrilling day of your
ttlife.  Say thanks.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNow you're gonna die, you bastard.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI lost a lot of blood.  Don't you
ttwant to donate some for me?  Then
ttwe'd really be part of each other.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttHang on.  I can't wait to see you
ttat the hospital.  So I can yank
ttyour fucking air tube out.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWish I could give you that
ttpleasure.  You deserve it.
ttt(coughing)
tt... Only I'm out of time.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttWhat's your name?  At least tell me
ttwho you are.

tThere's more violent coughing, then silence.  Then a cop's
tvoice is heard.

<b>ttttCOP'S VOICE
</b>ttHe's gone.

tStu stares at the receiver.

<b>ttttRAMEY
</b>ttDon't worry.  We'll find out who he
ttis.  And why he picked you.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttNo.  You won't.
ttt(a beat)
ttWhat do you want to bet you won't?

tStu reaches over and hangs up the receiver.  CLICK.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttI'll spend my whole life trying to
ttfigure that out.

tThen he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto
tthe waiting gurney.

tThe hypo is finally administered.  It kicks in immediately,
trelieving the pain.

tHe's wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance. 
tKelly is already inside waiting to accompany Stu to the
thospital.

<b>tSTU'S POV - BEING WHEELED AWAY FROM THE EMPTY BOOTH
</b>
tpulling away in LOW ANGLE.

tCAMERA SLIDES BACK inside the ambulance with Stu.  The doors
tshut, obliterating our view of the phone booth that was his
tentire world until moments ago.

<b>ttttSTU
</b>ttt(groggy)
ttGotta sleep now.  No phone calls...

tKelly smiles down at him as the image blurs.  Stu passes out 
t-- into a deep sleep he much deserves.

<b>tA SIREN BLARES.

<b>tCUT TO BLACK.
