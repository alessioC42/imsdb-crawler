<b>tINT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
tA billowy white screen.  An alarm clock BLARES.  As MAIN TITLES
tBEGIN, the lovely sleeping face of RACHEL KELLY rolls into frame.
tThen out of it.  Alarm keeps BLASTING.  Back she comes, pulling the
tsheets OVER her head.  Motionless now, as we hear...

t... the DEAFENING SILENCE of the alarm shutting off.  A beat.
tRachel SITS BOLTS UPRIGHT.  LEAPS out of the room.  From the back
twe see that she's dressed only in a pair of men's boxers.

tShe makes it halfway down the hall, does a U TURN back into the
tbedroom, frantically YANKS a robe hanging from the door, taking the
twall hook WITH her.  She FLINGS her robe on as she RUNS down the
thall, wall hook STICKING OUT of her back.  BURSTING INTO...

<b>tINT. BEN'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBen!  You overslept again damn it!

tThe room looks like a 6 (but I'm almost 7) year old exploded.
tPosters of MAGICIANS on all the walls.  Rachel darts about the room
tmismatching the clothes she forgot to arrange the night before.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttGet Up Get Up Get Up!

tThe LUMP under the cover doesn't move.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBen you're late.  I'm serious.  I'm
ttwearing a very serious face.  Don't
ttmake me start counting ONE...

tNo movement.  Rachel tugs the sleeve of a shirt hanging on a chair,
tand out comes a magician's bouquet of FLOWERS.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b><b>ttTWO.
</b>
tShe pulls a dirty handkerchief out of the pocket of the shirt --
tit's an endless MAGICIAN'S HANDKERCHIEF.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttDon't make me say three I'm about to
ttsay three.
ttt(a beat, then)
ttThree!

tShe RIPS the covers off and a blow-up DINOSAUR sleeps in Ben's
tplace.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBen I'm not kidding around.  You make
ttyourself appear this instant!

tA WHITE BUNNY saunters across her toes.  Rachel SCREAMS -- then
tgathers her wits and searches under the bed -- under the bureau --
tshe opens the closet doors and shoving clothes aside.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou might think this is funny but this
ttis actually NOT funny.

tUnseen by Rachel, six-year-old BEN sits, perched on the highest
tcloset shelf, knees under his chin, holding his breath.  His eyes
tgleeful as Rachel frantically closes the closet door.

<b>tINT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING
</b>
tRachel hops over the Bunny, navigates through strewn toys and books
tSTUBBING her baby toe.  She limps in agony past a big picture of
tthe kids with their daddy and heads towards a door with a KEEP OUT
tEVERYONE! sign.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(bellowing)
<b>ttANNABELLE!  WAKE UP!
</b>
<b>tANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
tANNABELLE, 10 years old, sits on the edge of her bed, fuming, all
tof her limbs crossed.  She holds up a filthy purple tee shirt.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttYou forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I
tttold you a hundred times it was Purple
ttDay at school today.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI didn't forget.  I was up all night 
ttthinking about it and I concluded you're 
tttoo special to look like everyone else.
ttt(she grabs an orangey 
ttt red tee shirt)
ttOrange Red.  That's your color.  Few 
ttcan carry it off.  Now please.  Help 
ttme find your brother.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttYou lost Ben?!

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttOf course not.  Does he look lost to 
ttyou?
ttt(big breath)
<b>ttBENNNNN!!!
</b>
<b>tINT. SUBURBAN EXTREMELY WELL-STOCKED KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
</b>
tRachel, smoking a cigarette and drinking a diet coke, FLINGS open
tpantry doors, closet doors -- looking for Ben -- attempting to put
tstone hard butter on toast at the same time.  She glances at the
tclock -- 7:55.  Oh dear.  Annabelle sits at the table, in a grumpy
torangey red mood.  Rachel hands her what was once a piece of toast.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttNo.  I told you.  I like apple butter
ttnot butter butter.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(hands her an apple)
ttHere.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttNever mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(forgot)
ttI'm almost done making it.
ttt(to the non-existent Ben)
ttAlright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy,
tt<u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy
tt<u>told</u> you he had an important case this
ttmorning and he had to leave early and 
ttwe were AAAAGGGGHHHH!

tShe has opened a cupboard with a Lazy Susan that turns revealing
tBEN sitting there.  Rachel screams AGAIN!

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttOh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're
ttlate.  You're really late.  Now get out
tthere and have some cereal.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttFine!  Eat in the cupboard.

tShe hands him a bowl of sugared cereal -- puts two spoonfuls of
tinstant coffee in Barney cup, and sticks it under the faucet.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops
tton the bottom.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttFine.

tRachel grabs the bowl, turn it UPSIDE DOWN on the table reversing
tthe order of the cereal.  She SWEEPS it back in the bowl and
tquickly hands it back to him, the phone RINGS THROUGHOUT...

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYou touched it.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttThen have a donut --

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAlright starve.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI'm gonna beep daddy at work.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttHe's badgering a witness.  Eat.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut you told us to starve.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(picking up phone)
ttHello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's
ttalready there?...I'm out the door...
ttt(Ben flings a fruit loop
ttt at her)
ttBen!  Knock it off!
ttt(into phone)
ttIt's gonna go beautifully...
ttt(another fruit loop)
ttDamn it Ben --

tRachel runs around absentmindedly loading out leftover pizza, 
tHoho's, and Chips.  She glances at the clock again -- 8:00.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttYou swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did
ttyou remember my egg carton?  I told
ttyou I needed my egg carton for seed
ttplanting today.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAbsolutely Duncan I'm on top of
tteverything.

tRachel takes the eggs from the fridge, and dumps them -- accidentally
tmissing the sink.  They SHATTER onto the floor.  She hands the empty
tcarton to Annabelle.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>tt...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --
ttt(she hangs up, panicked)
ttWe are late.  We are seriously late.  Which
ttmeans Mister Ben we've got to get you 
ttdressed --

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo!

tBen races away but Rachel LUNGES And CATCHES him.  He wiggles in
ther arms as she struggles to change his clothes.  Just as she gets
this bottoms off she drops his clothes in the pile of gooey eggs
twhen we hear a loud KNOCKING at the kitchen door.  Holding a half
tnaked Ben in her arms, Rachel looks up at...

tJACKIE HARRISON.  An immaculately dressed, intimidatingly intel-
tligent, utterly beautiful woman staring at her with extreme
tdisapproval.

<b>ttttANNABELLE AND BEN
</b>ttMommy!

tAnnabelle and Ben RACE into their mother's arms like little angels.
tJackie shoots a fiercely protective glare at Rachel.  They LOCK
teyes.  Enough wattage to light up all of Manhattan.

<b>tEXT. RACHEL'S LOFT, SOHO - MORNING
</b>
tJackie and the kids exit Rachel's building, onto a bustling Soho
tstreet.  The kids clamber into the double-parked Volvo wagon.
tJackie, still pissed, climbs behind the wheel.  Drives off.

<b>tINT. JACKIE'S VOLVO STATION WAGON - EARLY MORNING
</b>
tJackie drives the children down a tree-lined street in Englewood,
tNew Jersey.  Ben is banging Jackie's sunglasses case against the
twindow.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>tt...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red
ttand Blue make purple.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttt(yes she does)
ttI don't care.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI know you don't, but if you had, chrom-
ttatically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.

tJackie fishes through her purse.  Finds a toy airplane for Ben.  He
tstops banging her glasses case, starts banging the plane.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttWhy does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants?
ttDoesn't she have underpants of her own?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI noticed a whopping pile of laundry
ttsitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's
ttunderpants are in there -- Now where are
ttyour lunches?

tAs if by rote, they hold out their lunches.  One is a plastic Vons
tbag and the other a crumpled Macy's bag.  She collects them and
thands Ben and Annabelle two brightly colored lunch bags.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttAnnabelle sucked her thumb last night.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!

tAnd SLUGS him.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>tt<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to
ttsay 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling.
ttUse your words.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI hate when you say that.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThank you.  Those were all words.  I
tthate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name
ttfor a planet.

tAnnabelle and Ben look up at her curiously.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI hate snails and blue cheese.
ttEspecially together.  <u>Hate</u>.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI have lava.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(reflects)
ttLava's hateable.  I never thought of
ttthat.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI hate overly ripe bananas -- they make
ttme want to throw up.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttExcellent point.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI hate wax lips and red ants and
ttpretzels without salt...

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and
ttpeople who spit when they walk.

tJackie nods sagely.  Pulls up next to a school playground.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI hate to say goodbye.  Eskimo Kiss.
ttt(they rub noses)
ttRussian Orthodox Wedding Kiss.

tThey bump foreheads and elbows.  Ben runs toward the kindergarten
tplayground; Jackie watches concerned as Annabelle climbs the steps.
tThe only orangey red dot in a sea of purple.

<b>tEXT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, TRIBECA - MORNING
</b>
tTaxi pulls up to a converted warehouse.  Rachel BOLTS out, 
tSPRINTING for the door.

<b>tINT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - DAY
</b>
tBlack and white FILLS the frame.  Like a checkerboard.  We PULL
tBACK and realize we are seeing a group of PENGUINS waddling against
ta black and white backdrop.  We see a WHITE WAITRE'D in a BLACK
tTUXEDO holding glasses on a tray.  A BLACK MODEL, IMAN, in a WHITE
tDRESS glides through it all.

tIn the center the only dash of color is Rachel -- who has just
tentered and starts expertly directing the action.  She calls out to
ther assistant, COOPER.  Perpetually hip.  Perpetually young.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttCooper, back the fill off I don't have
ttenough shadow...

<b>ttttCOOPER
</b>ttYou've got a fruit loop in your hair.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou say that like I don't know that.

<b>ttttCOOPER
</b>ttI once threw an entire bowl of jello
tton my stepmother's head --

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAnd when did that pass?

<b>ttttCOOPER
</b>ttActually, never.  They'll always hate
ttyou.  There's a gene for it.

tDUNCAN SAMUELS -- Rachel's boss, an elegant, edgy, Englishman
tinterrupts them.

<b>ttttDUNCAN
</b>ttCongratulations.  Only forty minutes
ttlate.  You're handling this promotion
ttreally well Rachel.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttDuncan.  My work is everything to me.
ttThis'll never happen again.  Now stand
ttback -- this session's gonna make you
ttremember why you hired me even though
ttI wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper
ttlet's get these penguins dancing --

tDuncan backs off, charmed by her ballsiness.  The music BLARES just
tthen, and a penguin JUTS forward and NIPS the model.  The FLASH of
tthe camera.  We FREEZE for a second, seeing the photo Rachel just
ttook.  An Avedonesque portrait of a model being GOOSED by a penguin
tCOLLIDING with a maitre'd who SPILLS his tray and the penguins seem
tto be POINTING and LAUGHING uproariously.  It's an inspired photo.

<b>tINT. SCHOOL COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - 2:30 THAT DAY
</b>
tJackie and LUKE HARRISON -- ruggedly handsome man, mid-forties,
tcharming, disarming, and smart as they come.  They sit side by side
ton a couch across from RUTH FRANKLIN, an Elementary School Counselor

<b>ttttMRS. FRANKLIN
</b>ttMr. and Mrs. Harrison, while change is
ttexhilarating for adults, it can be 
ttquite challenging for a child.

tLuke's beeper beeps.  He ignores it; focuses on Mr. Franklin.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI won't get that...It's fine.  Change.
ttwe were talking about change.

<b>ttttMRS. FRANKLIN
</b>ttThe fact that you two are remarrying
ttobviously has Annabelle overjoyed...
ttt(they look at her,
ttt dumbfounded)
ttAnd she's very excited about your move to
ttSwitzerland.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttShe said we're getting remarried?

tSuddenly -- a long bell rings -- Jackie STANDS UP, startled.

<b>ttttMRS. FRANKLIN
</b>ttOnly a fire drill.  My concern is that
ttAnnabelle seems apathetic towards her
ttwork knowing she's leaving before the
ttend of the semester.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttMrs. Franklin we're not --

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttPlanning on getting --

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttRemarried.  There is no move.

<b>ttttMRS. FRANKLIN
</b>ttt(trying to appear unfazed)
ttReally?  Well then my concern for --

tLuke's beeper BEEPS again.  They talk right over Mrs. Franklin...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAre you here?

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI'm here.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttBecause you don't really seem here.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI'm here.  I've got a case where they're
ttthis close to sequestering the jury but
tthave I answered the goddamn thing?!

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSomething's up wi...

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYou think I didn't get that?

tShe cuts a look at Mrs. Franklin.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttExcuse him.  He never learned how
ttto turn the darn thing off.

tAnd reaches.  Does it for him.

<b>ttttMRS. FRANKLIN
</b>ttI'm wondering if there's anything going
tton at home that could be intensifying
ttAnnabelle's need to create this fantasy?

tLong pause.  Then suddenly they both start speaking AT ONCE.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI've been with someone for quite some
tttime, and didn't feel it was appropriate
ttfor her to move in too quickly.  But
ttafter a lot of thought and careful
ttdiscussion with her -- and the kids I
ttmight add -- she moved in last month.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSince our divorce Luke has seen a
ttnumber of different women in three
ttshort years and without a lot of
ttwarning for the kids, he's now living
ttwith a woman half his age --

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttRachel's not half my age.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWe're not discussing your age.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttWell, we're not discussing Rachel's
ttage either.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThey want to be with you Luke, they go
ttto your house to be with their father.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttJackie, they come to be part of my
ttlife.  Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.

<b>ttttMRS. FRANKLIN
</b>ttMr. Harrison, I hear you talking about
ttyour life, your needs, but are you
ttreally in touch with what Annabelle
ttneeds?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(suddenly fierce)
ttThis man would walk thru fire for
ttAnnabelle, gladly, any day of the week.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttNapalm.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttExcept for last Thursday when Rachel
ttforgot to pick them up --

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttJackie, she was five minutes late --

<b>ttttMRS. FRANKLIN
</b>ttI'm wondering if Annabelle is responding
ttto the underlying hostility that exists
ttbetween Rachel and Mrs. Harrison...

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttOf course she's responding to it.  You
ttthink it's easy for any of us?  You think
ttit's easy for Jackie to watch her kids
ttbeing looked after by someone who has
tthalf the experience she does?  Of course
ttshe's going to be hostile, irrational,
ttand defensive.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThank you Luke.

tMrs. Franklin doesn't quite know what to say.  The bell RINGS.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttThank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?
ttt(they get up)
ttThis has been very valuable for us.  And
ttI'll have a serious talk with Annabelle
tttonight.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttIt's Wednesday night.  She's at my
tthouse.  I'll talk to her.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI'll call from work.  We can have a
ttconference call.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou tried that last week and we were
tton hold forty-five minutes...

tAnd they're out the door.  You can hear the fight as it echoes down
tthe elementary school hallway.

<b>tEXT. SCHOOL, ENGLEWOOD, NEW JERSEY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tJackie and Luke exit the pleasant suburban school.  Head for the
tparking area...

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYou ask me that counselor's making
tta mountain out of a molehill...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI'm worried.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttMe too.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttLuke, I need to switch next Friday for
ttThursday, so why don't you take the
ttweekend...
ttt(pointedly)
tt...that way you'll be there, and I'll
ttpick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttFine.  But I wanted to take the kids
ttto work with me on Wednesday so I'll
tttake Wednesday, and you can pick up
ttthat Thursday, Friday after soccer,
ttand Saturday before riding.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttEasy enough.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttGood...Well...Take care.

tAs if on automatic pilot they move in to kiss each other goodbye
tthen stop.  Each takes a step back.  15 years of hellos and
tgoodbyes.  A beat.  A wave.  They head their separate ways.

<b>tEXT. JACKIE'S HOME - NIGHT
</b>
tEstablishing shot of Jackie's lovely home on its lovely street.
tOld trees.  Comfortable front lawns.  Safe and happy.  A place to
tgrow kids, dogs, probably walruses, even.  We PUSH toward the warm
tglow from within this home...

<b>tINT. JACKIE'S HOME - NIGHT
</b>
tJackie setting the table.  Annabelle recording the moment with her
tomnipresent VIDEO CAMERA...

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI didn't say that.  Why would I say
ttthat?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWell Daddy and I were thinking that
ttsometimes people tell a story about
ttwhat they wish would happen.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI don't want that to happen.  Why
ttwould I want that to happen?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWell you're telling your teachers and
ttyour friends --

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttMass hysteria.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttMaybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttLook if the truth is you don't feel like
tttalking about this right now that's fine.
ttBut don't look me in the eye with a big
ttsmile on your face and lie to me.
ttCause there are only so many lies you're

tBen enters in white gloves and Jackie's scarf.

</b>ttPick a card.  Any card.

tJackie picks a card.

</b>ttIt just slipped out.

ttWhat happens when he loves Rachel more

</b>ttAnnabelle, daddy and I will always be there.
ttThat's one time always is always.  You

tAnnabelle RUNS out of the room.  Jackie watches her sadly.  Ben
thits Jackie hard with his magic wand.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttPoof!  You're happy now.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThank you Ben.
ttt(unhappily)
ttAnnabelle!

tBen finds himself alone in the kitchen.  He hits himself on the

</b>ttTell me exactly how you're different
ttfrom three years ago?  The music
ttsounds kind of the same from where
ttI'm sitting.

tHe shifts in his chair.  Wants this to sound as authentic as he
tfeels it...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttJust not to me.

tThe waiter returns with a bottle of red wine.  It's horribly quiet
tas he pours.  Waits, obtrusively.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttThank you, it's fine...

<b>ttttWAITER
</b>ttWould you like to taste it?

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttCan we please have less service, here?

tThe waiter leaves, taking his attitude with him.  Luke sighs...

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttIt's going to be hard for the kids
ttwhen I tell them...I'd like you to
ttbe there.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttTo make it easier for them or you?

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttIt's a huge moment in their life --

</b>ttYou can't be an 'us' just when you
ttwant to.  You can't play that card
ttwhen it's convenient.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttWe...

</b>ttWE are over.

</b>ttWE'RE still their parents for the next

tOn this, Jackie looks down at her hands.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYou're still going to have to be
ttdealing with me -- with us.  We should
tttell them together.

tJackie sits next to Luke on the couch -- looking lovingly towards the
tchildren, who sit across from them.  Annabelle is taping this...

</b>ttThe great thing about life is that
ttthings keep changing.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttRemember when Mommy and Daddy got
ttdivorced?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAnd we all went through that together?

tON Ben.  OH MY GOD.  He knew it!

tON ANNABELLE -- Behind the video camera -- Where's this headed?

tBen LEAPS up from the couch and FLIES into Jackie's arms.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI knew it!  I knew it!  I knew you

tJackie looks at Luke.  Annabelle ZOOMS IN on their faces.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttNo they're not.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttAnnabelle put down that camera.

tShe ZOOMS in on his face.

</b>ttYou owe me a quarter.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttLook she's upset --

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttNo I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should
ttI care?  I mean nobody asked me when
ttyou got divorced.  Nobody asked me if
ttI wanted a new mother.  Nobody even

tBen runs out of the room.  Luke follows him.

tJackie moves to Annabelle who won't put down the camera.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAnnabelle...Rachel's not taking my place
ttas your mother -- it's just Daddy's chance
ttto be happy again.  Isn't that what we
ttall want for each other?

tNo answers.  Jackie looks at this daughter she loves so much.  Pats
tthe seat beside her...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttCome.  Sit.

tSomething in the softening of the tone changes the atmosphere in
tthe room.  More real.  More like equals.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttLife is full of hard things.  And we
ttcan't always have what we want, you
ttknow that.

tDon't you?  Annabelle nods, cautiously.

</b>ttBut we do have a choice.  To make it
ttbetter.  Instead of worse.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttLike how?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttLike seeing the good side of Rachel.
ttSo she'll see the good side of us.

tAnnabelle's stare is hard and questioning.  She didn't expect this.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttBecause I'm looking ahead.  And you
ttknow what I see...?

tAnnabelle doesn't.  But she sure is listening.

</b>ttTime will come.  When we all need to
ttbe there.  For each other.

tBarely any light in the empty kitchen.  PAN to see Ben, alone, in
this cape.  Carefully, he sets a cup of saucer atop a cloth napkin
tthat lies across the butcher block table.

tHe GRASPS the corners of the napkin.  He looks scared.  We get
twhat's about to happen.  As he...

t...YANKS the napkin, as FAST as he can, the cup and saucer, RATTLE

ttOkay...Is that the good thing or the

tShe grins.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttHow did <u>you</u> hurt someone?  <u>She</u> threw
tt<u>you</u> out, remember?

tHe does.  She hugs him tight.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttEverything's gonna work out.  The
ttkids and I...we're going to love

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttRache, it may take time.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWhat's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll
ttstill be ambulatory.  I think.

tShe's counting on her fingers.  He kisses her.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttIt's inevitable.  Look, I was
ttdefensive, I was insecure.  I was
ttafraid to love first.

tHer incredible smile.  Filling even Luke with confidence.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBut I'm not anymore.

tA sudden horrific CRASHING sound.  The breakage of the breakable.
tTheir look holds.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI'll get this.

tA quick kiss.  And she's gone.

tHOLD on Luke's light smile.  Maybe this <u>will</u> all work out.

tBen is cuddled up in his coverlet.  Almost as if he's hiding.  She

</b>ttAre you <u>real</u> mad?

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttHow could I be?  We learned some

tShe goes to his bed.  Sits down.

tShe kisses his forehead.  Very sweetly.

tHe nods.  Big time.  She stands, smiles...

</b>
t...the room of a sleeping child.  Rachel moves soundlessly to
tAnnabelle's side.  Stares down.  Listens to the soft breathing.
tShe straightens the covers slightly, in a maternal way.  Then, on
timpulse, reaches down...

t...tenderly smooths back a strand of hair.  One last look.  And
tshe...

t...leaves frame.  HOLD on Annabelle, as we hear the knob turn.  The

tthe shaft to reveal a glittering golden-colored gloss.  Then...

</b>ttIt's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The

</b>ttMom, look what Rache got me!

tUh-oh.  The kid holds it up.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttIt's not to wear around, or any-

</b>ttSee, I...

</b>ttt(taking it)
ttThat is so pretty.  You usually only
ttsee that color in people's teeth.

tAnnabelle has entered the house, to see on a table by the door a
thuge, brightly-wrapped PACKAGE.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttWow.  Who's that for?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttWell.  It's for you.

tThe kid WHIRLS around.  Really?

</b>ttJust because.  Just because I love

tAnnabelle starts to unwrap the present with Christmas-morning-care.
tJackie looks at the glitter gloss...

</b>ttI'm sorry, I just...

</b>ttHey.  At least it's not an editing

</b>ttNo way.  I told her two, three years,

ttOh, Mommy...

tAnd JUMPS into Jackie's arms, CRUSHING her with the hug mothers

</b>ttI hope it's the right kind.

</b>ttAre you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better

tJackie strokes her baby's head.

tThe child turns to Rachel, frozen in the doorwary.

tRachel swallows.

tRachel sits cross-legged on the floor of the walk-in closet.  Next
tto her, a glass and a botle of Stolie, getting toward the bottom.

tAn ashtray filled with butts, and...

t...a card board box.  Dragged out of somewhere.  Photo albums, loose
tsnapshots.  Vintage stuff.  From her face, this is <u>not</u> a carefree
tromp down Memory Lane.  She takes another hit on the Stolie.  More
tthan slightly intoxicated, weaving, squinting at...

t...the next photo.  Luke, young, straddling a Kawasaki.  Jackie,
tjust as young, holding him from behind.  She wears a halter and
tshorts, and looks simply terrific.

tRachel looks drunk and jealous.  With an overlay of self-pity.
tBrings the photo closer.  Squints harder.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWhat the fuck is that?

tHer worst fears confirmed...

tfighting the fear of what may come to pass.  Her pager goes OFF.

tJesus.  She pulls a cell phone from her purse.  Works it with one
thand.  Brings up...the smile.  Showtime.

</b>ttYes.

</b>ttDo me a favor?  Eat it, and then

tHe reaches for an apple off the BOTTOM of a huge display of Red

tlooks around for Ben.  He's gone.

tThe manager POINTS to the frozen food bin.  There, lying on his

</b>
<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNope.  I got my warm t-shirt.

tEnough of a non-sequitur to make everybody blink, before Jackie
tYANKS him, roughly and tenderly, from the bin.  She CRUSHES him in
ta violent, desperate hug...

</b>ttPushing her hair over her eyes.
ttMeans she's avoiding a confrontation.

tRachel looks over.  Really?  Jackie decides to share more.  Reading
tRachel's reaction to...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttIf she's twirling it, she's playing
ttsomething out in her mind.  If she's

tJackie snorts a laugh.  In spite of herself.

tA little strange.  Particularly the hardness of Jackie's eyes.
tRachel watching her.  Something's up.

</b>ttt(softly)
ttSure, if you like.

tJackie looks away now.  To the playground just beyond the
tbleachers.  Kids rise swings, clamber over a jungle gym.  But her
teyes are routinely, automatically, zeroing in on one single kid...

t...who is climbing his way UP a tall SLIDE.  Crouched over as he
tinches up the shiny metal surface, using the side rails.  Rachel
tfollows Jackie's eyes, just as...

t...Ben reaches the top and STANDS UP, hands OVER his head, Jackie's
tbreath catching, Ben totters once and...

t...FALLS fast, hitting the grass with a thump we can hear, lying
tcrumpled, motionless, as our two women...

t...SPRING up as one, SCRAMBLING down the bleachers, RUNNING toward
tthe playground, Jackie initially in the lead, but Rachel out-
tsprints her, CLOSING  on the child, as he rolls over grasping his
tleg, and reaching him first...

t...some instinct makes her hold back, let Jackie RUSH past her, to
tkneel at Ben's side.  She lifts her baby in her arms.  His pants

tA full house of walk-ins with assorted needs, none of which appear

tirritated Jackie finishes the last of the paperwork at the nurses
tstation.  Exchanges a less-than-pleasantry with the less-than-
thelpful duty nurse, and...

t...heads off through the crowd, DOWN a hallway, TURNS a corner, to

tfrom a vending machine.

ttWe'll talk to Mom and Dad...

</b>ttDad!  You can talk him into anything!

ttNice, huh?

tShe steps back.  Looks him in the eye.

tof a smile.

</b>ttShe's a charmer, you'll see.  In

tNow they're smiling at each other.  In the old way.  A nice moment
tfor them.

tAnd we notice.  It does look different.

tHer look holds.  An odd extra beat.

</b>ttNot the term I'd use.

tHe glances back through the doorway...

</b>ttYou want us to take him tonight?
ttGive you some private time with

tShe pats him on the shoulder...

</b>ttI'll drop him at Tucker's party
ttSaturday, if one of you guys can

tA door with balloons OPENS -- STACY, the birthday boy's mom, stands
tthere -- children running behind her in party hats, all with their
tconservatively dressed SUBURBAN MOMS.  Rachel's attire a sharp
tcontrast.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttHi, I'm here to pick up Ben.

<b>ttttSTACY
</b>ttDoes Jackie know this?

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttNo.  I'm doing it behind her back.

</b>ttIn seven years Jackie's never

ttWhere is she?

</b>ttSomething came up.  C'mon Ben!

tRachel eyes the MOUND OF PRESENTS yet to be opened.  DISSOLVE TO...

tFORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER...Rachel, in a pointed party hat, sits
tschmushed on the couch in between all the other MOTHERS.  A black
tjeans stranger in a strange peach land.  She eyes that mound of
tpresents.  Not even a dent.  She pulls out her cell phone, moves
ttowards the hallway.

</b>ttNow Ben, let Tucker play with his
ttBatcave...

tBen won't let go of Tucker's presents.  Tucker tries to take it.
tBen is adamant.  Rachel reaches for him, tousling his hair.

</b>ttHey Benjy boy -- chill.
ttt(he shimmies away from her)
ttHe's there already?  No I don't want to
tttalk to him -- Duncan?  How are you...

tThe mothers are all too aware of Rachel on the phone.  Two kids

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttI want it!

</b>ttBen I know you're angry and confused

ttDuncan I'm aware of that - Goddamn it
ttBen!  Let go of it.  NOW!

tHe stares at her.  It looks like he's gonna let go --

tOn the mothers -- impressed, not to mention surprised.  When Ben
tsuddenly HURLS the toy onto the floor SHATTERING IT!  A horrible
tSILENCE falls over the room.  Broken only by the sound of Duncan
tSCREAMING from inside the phone.

<b>ttttDUNCAN IN PHONE
</b>ttRachel...This is a big bloody account --

ttNow would you do us both a favor and

tShe SLAMS the phone SHUT.  Hands it to Ben.

</b>tt...make it disappear.

tOkay.  He SHOVES it down the front of his pants.  The peach moms
tare taken aback.  Rachel nods, you got it.  Delighted, Ben turns,
tscampers off, as...

t...his pants start RINGING.  He stops dead.  Looks down at them.

tStill RINGING.  He turns around and waddles delicately back to
tRachel, as if he's carrying nitro in his shorts.  She holds out her

</b>ttBreaks out the geiger counter, the

tRachel blinks.

</b>ttExcuse me.  If Jackie Harrison were

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(mutters)
ttWhat the hell.

tOPENS the door.  Enters the empty home.  Walks slowly, self-
tconsciously, down the hallway.  Kitchen, kids' rooms...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttNow, if I were a science book,
ttwhere would I...

tAnd stops.  At the doorway of the master bedroom.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWho am I kidding.

tAnd goes straight to Jackie's desk.  Starts rummaging through the
tincredibly neat stack of papers...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttGreat, I'm leaving prints.

tThe open appointment book.  Today's date.  Just says, NEW YORK.
tNothing more.  Opens a drawer.  Stapler, clips, neatly-stacked
tstationery.  Opens the bottom drawer, and...

t...stops.  She pulls out...AIRLINE TICKETS.  Opens the folder.
tContinental Airlines.  Newark to San Francisco.  And tucked
tinside...

t...a fax, neatly folded.  Rachel opens it.  The letterhead says,
tNORTH POINT PRESS, 134 Sutter Street, San Francisco, California.

tJackie takes a kettle from the stove.  Pours the water into a tea
tcup.  Then, fills a second cup.  Drops a tea bag into each.
tCarries both cups to...

t...the kitchen table.  Where Rachel is waiting.  She looks more
tthan tense.  Actually, scared.  Jackie taking this in, as she sets
tdown the tea.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttOkay, what is this?  If you want to
ttdump Luke on me, no sale.  You're
ttstuck with him.

tAnd before she can sit...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI know your secret.

tJackie FREEZES.  To stone.  No one says anything.  Two hearts
tbeating at red-line.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI don't know wh...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI was looking for Annabelle's book,
ttand I found your tickets.  And the

</b>ttYou WHAT?

</b>ttYou're taking the kids.  And moving

tAnd Jackie has to laugh.  Cold.  Bitter.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttLook, you've never liked me...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttDon't flatter yourself.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAnd I know checking into your life

</b>ttNobody likes a snoop.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBut I came here to...

tAll the air comes out of this young woman.  so vulnerable, so real.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>tt...to beg you.  Not to do it.

tAnd at this.  A look of intense interest crosses Jackie's face.
tReally?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI'd have thought this was the
ttanswer to your prayers.  Lose the
ttwitch, and her two brats, in one
ttswoop.  Problems solved.

tRachel is clearly distraught. This is no act.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou can't take Luke's children
ttaway from him.

tJackie thinking.  Reading this girl's face.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttBi-coastal parenting.  Happens every

ttideal, but people make it work, and...

ttWe can't live like that.

</b>ttLuke.  Can't live like that.

tAh.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThen let him talks to me.  We don't
ttneed you to solve our prob...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(quietly)
tt...it's my problem, too.

tAnd Rachel's eyes.  Fill with tears.  She hates that.  Jackie won't
ttake her off the hook.  Stands waiting, until...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI got used to...thinking of them.
ttAs...my kids too.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttReally.  By what right?  Six months
ttof part-time screw-ups?

tRachel lifts her chin.  Defiant and tender at once.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttNo right at all.  I just love them.

tNow it's Jackie's eyes.  That begin to fill.  And she hates that
teven more.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(pleading)
ttThere's <u>so</u> many publishing houses
ttin New York.  Surely, you could find
tta good one?

tJackie takes a step back.  Shakes her head.  Goddammit, life is
tfull of surprises.  She walks around in a little circle.  Turns
tback...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSure, I could.  If I was looking
ttfor one.

tRachel's turn to be surprised.  Confused.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou're a moron, kid.  You guessed
ttthe wrong secret.

tAn odd, almost defiant look.  Jackie reaches up to her own head,
tand...

t...slowly, holding eye contact all the way, she slips the wig from
ther head.  Her scalp covered by the partial regrowth that chemo-
ttherapy has left her.  You can hear Rachel's GASP clear to Kansas.

ttget them in San Francisco.

tRachel's lips part.  But no sound comes.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttLife's a trade-off.  You get cancer,

</b>ttt(please)
ttYou're not dying.

tThe kid so painfully sincere.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttNo such luck.  I'm beating the shit
ttout of this.  Pardon my French.

tRachel can't find her breath.  She is clearly the worse off of the
ttwo, in this moment.  Then she starts to nod...

</b>ttYou bet you are.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttHow the hell would you know?

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI don't, but...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttHow would you know <u>anything</u>?

tThat was sharp.  Rachel startles slightly.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI exercise, I eat the healthiest
ttfoods, you live on pork rinds and

tThat leaves a silence.

tLeans over the table.  Rachel looks scared to death.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttOkay, I'm undeserving.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttIronic, huh?

tAnd staring in Rachel's eyes, Jackie's fierceness fades.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttIronic, that I'm gonna need you.

tAll the air comes out.  Her heart as naked as her skull.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttTo be a little less.  Undeserving.

tThe look holds.  And holds.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttDrink your tea while I go vomit.

tAnd turns, goes to the door.  Turns back.

</b>ttYou love my kids, that's a start.

tHe kisses her hair and flinches slightly.  Tries to pretend it's
tbecause she's concentrating on the movie.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttThey're my kids.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttGreat, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u>

<b>tINT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tJackie and Ben cuddled in bed, watching a video in the darkened
troom.  It is not a French Comedy.  They are, however, eating
tpopcorn.

tThe door opens.  Annabelle stands motionless, composed.  Her face
tlooks like she's been crying.  She clears her throat...

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI'm sorry you're sick.

tFrom across the room.  Jackie stares at her.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI can't hear you.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b><b>ttTHEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
</b>
tJackie cups her hand to her ear.  Shakes her head, can't hear a
tthing.  Waves, come on over.  And slowly...

t...Annabelle does.  Crawls up into the bed, on the opposite side
tfrom Ben.  Into her mother's arms.  Jackie kisses her head, strong.
tBig smile.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI said...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>tt...I'm not deaf, y'know.

tThey grin at each other.  Like equals.  Jackie picks up the remote,
tcuts OFF the sound.  And when Ben turns to her...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(singing)
ttIn the still...still of the
ttni-ight...I held you...held
ttyou so ti-ight...

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThat's Rache's song!

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSugar.  I was slow dancing to that
ttsong before Rachel was even born.

tWow?  Really?  You bet.  Annabelle chuckles.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou think she's the Queen of Cool?

tJackie shakes her head.  Pulls down the covers, pulls up her
tt-shirt...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttDoes she have a tattoo?

tThe butterfly.  Just below her navel.  Ben has seen this before, of
tcourse.  Touches it, with his small hand.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttHe wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her
ttin the shower!

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAnd...?

tBen looks to his sister.  For the verdict.  Annabelle shakes her
thead.  Nope.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttShe is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool.
tt<u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttShe is but an arriviste.

tA new word, apparently.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttA newcomer.  She's still got a
ttthing or two to learn.

tAnnabelle nods.  You betcha.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(resumes singing)
ttI held you...held you so ti-ight...
ttt(to Annabelle)
ttYou sing lead, you've got the voice...

tShe bumps head gently with Ben.

<b>tEXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT
</b>
tParents streaming slowly in for a PTA night.  They are chatty,
ttired, preoccupied.  And 95% female.

<b>tINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tFolding chairs set in rows.  Parents taking their seats with coffee
tand cookies.  Up front, a table where a panel of speakers are
tbeginning to gather.  A faded banner says PTA -- TENAFLY DAY SCHOOL.
tJackie is nibbling at a single cookie, when...

t...a figure slips into the seat beside her.  Rachel is juggling a
tcoffee and maybe nine cookies.  Drops one.  Picks it up.  Dusts it
toff.  Jackie is repelled, but has to smile.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSmall world.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttLuke's depo ran late.  I promised
ttI'd take notes.

tTo prove it, she balances the cookies on her thighs, and produces a
tnotebook.  Looks around, and in a conspiratorial near-whisper...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttSo I have to tell you something
ttin confidence...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou're a cross-dresser.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttThat.  And.  Annabelle is over
tther head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat'
ttKovitsky.

tDoes a Groucho eyebrow move.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttShe hasn't mentioned this.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttShe was afraid you'd make a big
ttdeal out of it.

tJackie is hurt.  Covers...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttMoi?

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttToi.  They've been 'going out'
ttfor two weeks.

tRachel breathless and happy.  Jackie attentive.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAs you may know, 'going out' in the
ttsix grade doesn't mean shit.  They
ttdon't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or
ttanywhere, they don't even eat lunch
tttogether, it's just a declaration to
ttthe world that they're...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>tt...going out, yeh.  I had kids of
ttmy own, once.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAnyway.  He walks up to her on
ttlunch yard today.  And tells her...
ttpublicly...that they're 'breaking up.'

tJackie's mouth drops.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttOh, my God.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttRight.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of
ttthis 'going out' thing, so one of them
ttcan dump the other one, and they can
ttimitate the whole passionate adult
ttsoap opera tragedy, without ever
tthaving to actually date.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttShe's devastated.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttDoesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it.
ttI mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u>
ttis serious.

tRachel GRIPS Jackie's arm.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttShe spent an <u>hour</u> in the girls' bath-
ttroom, <u>crying</u> with eight of her <u>closest</u>
ttfriends, who are sending the message
ttto every boy in the grade that Brad
ttKovitsky is yesterday's <u>toast</u>.

tDevours an entire cookie in one gulp.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttSo here's the point.  I pick her up
ttfrom soccer, she tells me the whole
ttmess, and asks me what to do.

tHow about that?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAnd you said...?

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBeats me.  Ask your mom.

tOh.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttSo she's gonna.  Tomorrow.

tLeans closer.  Whispers...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttDon't fuck this up.

<b>tINT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
tJackie and Annabelle are sitting at the kitchen counter with maybe
ttwenty hardboiled eggs.  They are cracking the shells gently, and
tcarefully peeling them.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWell, did you really think you'd
ttmeet someone at <u>eleven</u> that you'd
ttspend the rest of your <u>life</u> with?

tAnnabelle keeps her eyes on her eggs.  A craftswoman.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttNo, but I thought till Thursday.

tOh.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWhat's Thursd...

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttA debate.  Man's inhumanity to
ttwoman.  He's pro women.  I'm con.
ttMs. Flannery is twisted.

</b>ttI could help with the debate.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttt(glum)
ttGreat.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(thinking it over)
ttActually.  I could only help him.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttEvery time I'm on the lunch
ttyard, and he's with twelve of
tthis retarded <u>dorkface</u> little
ttadoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou don't like his friends.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>tt...they all yell 'There goes the
ttVirgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess',
ttor some <u>really</u> clever cut like that.
ttLike it hurts my feelings.

tThey keep peeling eggs.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou wouldn't kiss him, huh?

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttNot with my mouth open.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(softly)
ttGood girl.

tAnnabelle's eyes well up.  She covers by concentrating all the
tharder.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAnd what do you do wh...

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI call him a fartface or a pervert,
ttor something equally lame.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou have to ignore him.

tAnd on this.  Annabelle looks up.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttHe's not even there.  You don't
ttsee him, you don't hear him, you're
ttjust too much of a woman to bother
ttwith little boys.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttThis is a joke, right?

tJackie shakes her head.  Nope.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAll he wants is the attention.
ttWhen he can't get to you, he'll try
ttharder for a little while.  Then,
tthe'll give up.  It'll be no fun.

tThe kid blinks.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttYou think Rache would do that?

tTakes Mom back a bit.  Enough for her daughter to notice.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttIt's just she's younger.  Maybe
ttshe remembers how to do this.

tJackie shrugs.  Maybe.  Annabelle studies her.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttThis'll work, huh?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttOh, yeh.

tAnnabelle takes heart from her mom's confidence.  Nods, with her
ttrademark determination.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttHow many devilled eggs can
ttyou eat?

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttMaybe twenty.

tJackie surveys the table.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWe can always go to the store,
ttif w...

tA sudden BANGING on the screen door.  They turn to see...

t...a breathless six-year-old TUCKER through the screen.  The
tbirthday boy at the recent party.

<b>ttttTUCKER
</b>ttMrs. Harrison...?

<b>ttttJACKIE

ttfell off the top?

<b>tEXT. YARD - DAY
</b>
tAERIAL VIEW of Jackie, Annabelle, Tucker and assorted neighborhood
tlooky-loo kids from SEVENTY FEET in the air.  Everyone looks like
tTINY DOTS running around the lawn.  We realize that we are almost
tat the TOP of a giant EVERGREEN TREE.

tWe see a patch of red.  And now a blue stripe.  The wind reveals
tmore -- It's BEN CLIMBING to the very top of the tree.  The calling
tof his name becoming more and more faint in the distance -- His leg
tMISSES a branch -- causing a cluster of PINE CONES to FALL in front
tof Jackie -- she looks up screaming --

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b><b>ttBEEEENNNNNN!
</b>
tJackie's POV -- Ben crouched at the top of the evergreen -- as the
twind sways the tree perilously back and forth.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttDon't move!

tSMASH CUT TO LATER, as...

tAn enormous CRANE moves through the sky.  Jackie holds tightly onto
tJESSICA, a diminutive five-foot-tall Firewoman, as they soar skyward
ttowards Ben.  A slightly condescending tone to...

<b>ttttJESSICA
</b>ttThat's quite a grip you have there
ttMa'am.  Do we have an issue with
ttheights?

tPatronized the wrong gal.  In a crisis.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(looking her up and
ttt down)
ttI don't care if you're a dwarf,
ttso long as you do your job.
<b>ttBEN!  I'M COMING!  STAY THERE!

</b>
<b>ttttJESSICA
</b>ttMa'am, my arm's going numb, maybe
ttyou could loosen your grip just a
ttlittle.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThat's absolutely out of the question.
<b>ttBEN!  I'M HERE!
</b>
tThe crane STOPS.  Ben has climbed to the top branches of the trees;
tthey SWAY from side to side like a METRONOME.

<b>ttttJESSICA
</b>ttHello Ben.  Your mother says you're
ttreal good at disappearing --

tBen tries to climb a little higher -- Branches SNAP.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttBen!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now
ttstop climbing!
ttt(He keeps climbing)
ttBen listen to me...

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttNo!  I have to get there.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWhere Ben?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBefore you.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttBen where do you have to get to?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHeaven.  I have to tell him he's made
tta mistake.  He should take Grammy
ttMartha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.

tJackie's heart breaks, unable to speak.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttBen.  God doesn't like visitors.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttHow do you know?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAsk her, she's a heroic Fireperson.
ttShe does this twenty times a day.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttOh.

tJessica begins to crawl out to him on the limb.

<b>ttttJESSICA
</b>ttOh yeh.  It's in our official manual.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThat's right, Ben.  That's why Firemen
tthave giant ladders and climb up
ttand down poles.  They're like...
ttmessengers... carrier pigeons...
ttbetween heaven and earth.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttThat's good cause we need to hurry.
ttMy mom doesn't have very much time
ttleft.

<b>ttttJESSICA
</b>ttThen you know what we should do?
ttWe should go to the Fire Station
tttogether and ring the firebell to
ttget God's attention.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttCause it's an emergency.

tBen opens his arms, teeters, and Jessica HAS him.  She reaches him
tout, and...

t...HANDS him to Jackie, alone in the cherry-picker.  Jackie GRASPS
tBen, pulling him FIERCELY to her arms in a death grip.

tFrom down below, the kids CHEER.  The worst is over.

tHOLD on Jackie, clutching her baby for dear life.  Knowing it isn't.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tJackie stands in the doorway watching her son -- her baby boy --
tsleeping.  She looks drawn, but even if her body would let her
tsleep she couldn't.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(a whisper)
ttGod...I will do anything...I will
ttgo through any amount of pain you
ttgive me.  If you'll just let me
ttsee them grow up.

tA slow ragged breath.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttIs that asking so damn much?

tShe leaves the room soundlessly.  Ben stirs.

<b>tANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
tAnnabelle sleeps soundly in the glow of a night light.  Jackie
tappears, leaning down to rouse her gently.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAnnabelle...wake up honey...

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttt(sleepy)
ttMom?  What's wrong?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttNothing sweetheart.

tJackie sits on the edge of the bed, stroking Annabelle's head.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI got Ginny Weintraub to come stay
ttwith Ben.

tAnnabelle's puzzled look.  Why would you do that?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttHow'd you like to go someplace
ttspecial with me?  Right now.

<b>tEXT. NORTH VALE STABLES - NIGHT
</b>
tThe light of the full moon illuminates the night and we see Jackie
tand Annabelle sitting on a horse.  Annabelle in front, Jackie with
ta strong hold on her.  Both have their nightgowns tucked into their
tjeans, coats over them.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttHold tight, sweetheart.

tShe KICKS the horse forward and they HEAD OFF toward the rolling
thills in the distance.  Jackie and Annabelle ride faster and faster
talong the trail.  Jackie has one arm firmly around Annabelle's
twaist and controls the horse with the other.  Jackie closes her
teyes for a moment, allowing the wind to wash over her.  The smells
tand sounds of the night seem to free her, give her strength.
tAnnabelle relaxes against her mother and giggles with delight.
tJackie soon joins her, and the sounds of their laughter break the
tsilence of the night.

tThey come to a stop at the crest of a small hill and we now see the
ttears on Jackie's face.  Annabelle can't see, and stares out at the
tmoonlit valley before them.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI'm never, never going to forget this.

tAnnabelle snuggles back.  Happy.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttNever say never.

tJackie kisses the top of her baby's head.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou're old enough to learn the
ttloophole.  <u>You</u> can say 'never,
ttnever'.  If you mean it enough.
ttTo say it twice.

tAnnabelle yawns.  So content in her mother's arms.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI'll remember.  Always, always.

tSo Jackie grips a little tighter.  Breathes a single word, just
tloud enough to hear...

tRachel and Luke heading up the path to Jackie's door.  It is early

tThey follow Rachel down the hall...

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(Mister Rogers)
ttWe'll share.  Like good neighbors.

tThey enter the living room.  Annabelle sits sullenly in front of
tthe TV.  Her overnight duffle and book bag and coat piled beside
ther.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttHey, gorgeous, where's Big Mama?

tNo answer.  Annabelle worried about something.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttShe still packing for her trip?

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.

tThey slap FIVE.  Go through the ritual of a three-step black guy
thandshake.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAnd...other things?  At school?

tAnnabelle cuts a look in Luke and Ben's direction.  Please <u>not</u> in
tfront of the menfolk.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWe'll talk.  I'll go check
tton Mom.

tAnnabelle frowns at Mom's name.  Rachel strokes her.  Heads down
tthe hall...

tKnocks at the open door to Jackie's bedroom, where Jackie is
tcalmly, meticulously, laying out things beside her large open
tsuitcase.  She waves Rachel in, and keeps working.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(checking out the
ttt stuff)
ttIt's gonna be cool, huh?

tBulky sweaters.  Wool things.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI can never figure weather.  Last
tttrip, I made all the wrong choices.

tRachel and we have a better angle now.  Jackie looks awful.  Drawn,
tweak, masking pain with obvious courage.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBad day?

tRachel sits on the edge of the bed.  Jackie turns away, goes to her
topen chest of drawers.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttCan't complain.

tEven her voice is carefully under control.  Awkward, Rachel looks
taround the room.  A stack of photo albums, scrapbooks, open.  Works
tin progress.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttCan I look at the pictures?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttIt's a mess, right now.  That's
ttmy project when I get back.

tSo quiet, we can hear a clock TICKING nearby.  Rachel's gaze
treturns to the bulky sweaters.  Holds there.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSee, I'm not going to Houston,
ttafter all.

tLike you obviously figured out.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThere's this clinic in Montreal.
ttWe've studied their process, we
ttlike their success rate...

tTwo women nodding, in a calm, matter-of-fact way.  As if discussing
trecipes.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThey combine some compounds that
tthave been getting results in France,
ttwith vitamin injections.  Seems to
ttactivate the chemo...

tSilence.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttSo.  Hopeful.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttIt's promising, this one.  We're

tRachel swallows.  She's out of words.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI really look like shit.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou look sick.  But you look...
tttogether.  Mentally tough.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYeh, that's bull.  I'm going for
ttserene, they say some actually get
ttthere.

tA shrug.  The first bitterness to seep through.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttProb'ly low percentage on mothers.

tShe sits, unceremoniously, right on the floor.  Pantomimes a smoke.
tRachel goes into her bag.

</b>ttThe primo stuff is great for pain.

</b>ttI think my 'primo shit' got left
ttin my 'bellbottoms.'

tJackie lighting up.  Deep soulful drag.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSo.  She ignores this little Kovitsky
ttpunk, takes the high moral ground...

tReading Rachel's face.  Who is already wincing.

ttAnd you said...

</b>ttWhat else?  Keep on keepin' on.

tOh.  Rachel tries to hide her disappointment.

</b>ttDuncan is doing his Himmler

ttIt's on the stove.

tShe kisses Ben's head, Luke's mouth, that one lingering a little.
tThen, down the hall to...

tthan death.

tto speak.

tDuncan and his client watch as Cooper assists Rachel, who SHOOTS
tthe menagerie from low ANGLES.  At last, she lowers her camera.
tCheck her watch.  Shoots Cooper a knowing look.  And HANDS HIM the
tcamera.  WAVES to her subjects...

tsports.  And sitting on the ledge by the flag pole...

t...two children.  The little boy is reading his Garfield book for
tthe three hundredth time.  His big sister is simply crying, openly,
tfor a disinterested world to see.  A car SCREECHES up.  The driver
tBLASTS out the door, RUNS to us...

tThen crouches slowly.  At Annabelle's feet.

</b>ttOh, baby, I'm so sor...

tGreat.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttAnd Mom says anger never, never

tJust this once.

</b>ttIf I tell you what to do.  Can we

tAnd Jackie LEAPS out of the wheelchair, RUNS across the distance,
truns to SCOOP her babies in her arms...

t...Jackie's bedroom.  Where Jackie freezes.  Her mouth OPEN.  For
tRachel has...

t...HUNG striking black and white PHOTOS of the children all OVER
tthe room.  One is of Ben's FEET, left shoe on right foot and vice-
tversa.  Another glimpses Annabelle's beautiful FACE hidden in her
thair.  Ben sitting in a cupboard.  Annabelle a bold ear of corn.
tBen sitting on the bottom limb of the huge evergreen.  Annabelle
tkissing her horse's muzzle.

tJackie just stands.  Trying not to cry.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttOkay.  These are good.

t...two women on a bench.  Under a starkly bare tree.  Jackie is

</b>ttt(softer)
ttI know you, huh?  The car pools,

ttI'm telling you the biggest gift
ttyou can give them is your happiness.

tCan you hear me?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttCause if you're not, the easiest

ttnext to you.  And you'll push him
ttaway, and then hate him even more
ttwhen he goes, until finally you have
ttno choice but to leave.  And that

ttsting.'

tThin smile.  Now it's Jackie watching Rachel's profile.

</b>ttBen was born in two hours, went
ttright to my breast and camped
ttthere for three days.  Always with

tWatches Rachel nodding, absorbing.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSomehow, his blanket always looked
ttlike a cape, even the nurse said
ttthat.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story,
ttover and over.  How he was born a

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(softly, never turning)
ttAnd her...?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttTook 28 hours.  She just wasn't
ttsure about entering this world.

tWatches the feeling well in Rachel's eyes.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThe doctor wanted to go in and get
tther, but I knew she'd come in her
ttown time.

tRachel nods.  It fits.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThat's who she is.  Don't let
ttanybody rush her.

tSilence.  A murmur...

</b>ttI'll keep that in mind.

tRachel settles back.  Her eyes now locked away somewhere private.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttWhat?

tRache smiles.  That Jackie sensed something.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttIt's not about the kids.

tLooks over.  Decides whether to ask...

tLooking.  Looking.

tIt did.  People are passing them.  They do not notice.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttShe called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWhat do you call it?  You told her
ttyou had doubts.

tHe looks around.  People are moving on.  Toward their drinks, their
tdinners, their lives.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttCan we go sit somewhere?

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttLet me put it this way.  Hell, no.

tAnd takes out her cigarettes.  Her fingers fumble slightly.  It

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI told her I loved her.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBy way of saying you were unhappy.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttRestless.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttExcuse me.  'Things are so confusing

ttThat's what I said.  But I didn't

</b>ttNo, she threw you out.  What a

tPulls out her box of matches.

</b>ttSo now <u>I</u> get to wait...

tA single match...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttFor the first sign.  The first

</b>ttWhat do you figure, Luke?  When

tLights her cigarette.  As he watches.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(softly)
ttThat's a pretty ugly thing you

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttNo, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe.
ttIt's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not

tBig draw.  Never wavering from his eyes.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>tt'But keep dancing, and if you're

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttThat's not us.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBecause you've changed so much.

tHe puts his hands on her, gently.  But she flinches.  So the hands
tcome away.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYou want me to show you the future.
ttWell, I can't darlin'.

tI can't.  She searches the lovelight in his eyes.  As if she could
tweigh it.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttWe make our lives, one step at a

tttruth about the future?  A promise.
ttIs only a hope.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttHow about the promises we make to
ttour kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do
ttwe shrug those off, just that easily?

tThat slows him down.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttMaybe Annabelle deserves to find

ttWhile her mom is still around.

tStops him.  Cold.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(quiet)
ttHey.  Just a thought.

tTakes a step back.  Only one.  But it registers.

tAcross the way, the boy leans, kisses Annabelle sweetly on the

tAnnabelle pretends not to know that.  Just walks casually toward

tRachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set.  She
tis pacing in a circle, looking like a kid waiting to see the
tprincipal.  Sucking her cigarette like smoke was oxygen.  She picks
ta bottle of beer off the grass.  Twists the top.  Settles awkwardly
ton the seat of the taller swing.

tHEAR the screen door open.  Bang shut.  Rachel takes a sip.  Before
tshe looks up...

tJackie on the prowl around this swing.  Stalking her prey.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttActually.  They'll want Annabelle's

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttIs that what you're worried about?
ttLooking bad at the PTA?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou are <u>defending</u> what you did?

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttRight down to the ground.  Let's

tNot quite what Jackie expected.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou put filth in my child's mouth.

</b>ttAw.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou had her <u>lie</u> about that...

</b>ttWorked.  Like a charm.

</b>ttYou weren't passing 'em out.

</b>ttWell, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing

tStalking.  Closer.  Fierce.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttMine.  Is a <u>little</u> different.

tRight there.  At the swing.  In her face.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSee, in that crisis, I saw an

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttOh please.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttShut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go
ttbehind <u>your</u> back.

tThe one scored.  Rachel sips her beer.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttDoing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who
ttyou <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer
ttpressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that
ttlevel, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttShe wasn't steering her own course,
ttshe was steering <u>yours</u>.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWell, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>,

tSilence.

ttit was.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAnd she'll fight back again.  God help

tJackie's voice drops.  The softness makes it somehow more
tmenacing...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou've turned her into you.  And
ttI may not get another chance.  To
ttturn her back.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(suddenly fierce)
tt<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u>

tThe hand with its cigarette STABS out...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>tt<u>You</u> won't get the chance.

tJackie back on her heels.  Thinking.  A mile a minute.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou've got a point there, for a

tHER finger stabbing out.

</b>tt<u>You</u> didn't get <u>morning</u> sickness for

ttYou will see them <u>married</u>, you will

ttBITCH, I hate your GUTS!

tThe blast washes over Rachel.  And in the silence...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttNow you're talking sense.

tShe looks down at her beer.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAll year long, I've been watching how
ttyou do this.  The worries, the sacri-

tThinks.  Really thinks.  Wants so much to say this right.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAnd I admire you.  More than you'll

ttthing...has been growing.  Inside me.

tLooks up.  Straight to her eyes.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttFor better or worse.  I'm not you.

tAnd so she stands up.  The swing shimmies in her wake.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI can't live my life channeling the
ttOne True Mom after you're gone.  I
ttcan't do it.  I can't do it.  I can't.
ttDo it.

tSets the beer down.  Stabs out her smoke.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWe have to deal with that.

tAnd walks off, slowly.  Across the yard.

<b>tINT. INDOOR RIDING RING - TWILIGHT
</b>
tHuge indoor space.  Wood-sided walls, dirt floor.  High corrugated
tmetal roof, with birds flying, roosting in rafters.  A little GIRL,
tunder the keen eye of her TRAINER, puts her mount through its
tpaces.  In the cold air, steam rises from the horse's body.  It's
tlate, no one else around.  TRACK now...

t...down a walkway.  Toward the stables.  A barn cat is crouched,
tstalking prey.  We hear a soft voice, speaking.  One we know...

<b>ttttLUKE (O.S.)
</b>ttIt was like telling her...

tSee him now.  Standing awkwardly, against the side of a stall.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>tt...that I didn't love her anymore...

tSee the horse, still steaming.  Standing patiently.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>tt...if I could be sure I'd always
ttstay.

tCircling the horse now, we see Annabelle's back.  She is slowly
tbrushing out the sweat mark.  Where the saddle used to be.  Her
tmovements are stiff, mechanical.  The soft voice continues...

<b>ttttLUKE (O.S.)
</b>ttShe said, 'This thing you call a
ttpartnership.  The schedules, the
ttchores, all the things we have to
ttwork out...'

tOur ANGLE CIRCLING to see at last Annabelle's face...

<b>ttttLUKE (O.S.)
</b>ttt(softer)
tt'...for the kids.'

tThe tears that stand in her eyes.  The set line of her small mouth.

<b>ttttLUKE (O.S.)
</b>tt'...that's the life I dreamed of.
ttAnd it's all I ever wanted it to be.'

tShe swallows.  Because she will not cry.

<b>ttttLUKE (O.S.)
</b>ttThat's the kind of person your mom is.
ttShe's the best.

tAnnabelle says nothing.  She drops to her knees.  Begins to clean
tout one of her horse's hooves with a metal pick.  The only sound
tagainst the stillness.

tAnd her father watches.  His heart pounding.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI complained a lot, baby.  We couldn't
tttravel, we'd lost our privacy, our
ttchance to do things on the spur of the
ttmoment.  To live for...ourselves.  The
ttway we'd started out.

tHe goes to her.  The sound of his feet on the straw.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttAnd she said.  Sounds like you'd be
tthappier.  If the kids weren't around.

tCrouches down.  Very close to his child.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI said.  I love them more than
ttanything.  But sometimes... I do
ttmiss what I've lost.

tAnnabelle stops working.  Turns her faces away.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttShe said she could never feel that
ttway, not for one single second.

tSo he leans closer.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttShe didn't want to be with someone.
ttWho could.

tSilence.  He's staring at the back of her head.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYou know, this horse smells
ttreally bad.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttThere's worse things.

tAt least she can talk.  If only just above a whisper.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttDo you know why I never told
ttyou all this before?

tA beat.  She doesn't look at him.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttSure.  You wanted me to blame her.
ttInstead of you.

tWaiting to hear...

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttt(very softly)
ttThat's right.

tShe hears honesty.  And heartbreak.  It makes her turn...

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttHow come you're telling me now?

tHe gets lost.  Looking in those eyes.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI don't want to be wrong anymore.

tI don't.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttI want to say I'm sorry, because I am.
ttAnd let you hate me.  If you have to.

tShe swallows hard.  Her eyes moving over his face.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttSee that feeling?  Where you feel
tttwo different things at once?
ttThat's a grown-up thing.  It's
ttnot a lot of fun.

tShe shakes her head very slightly.  And her eyes water.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttKnow why your mom never told you?

tShe doesn't.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttShe knew that you and her were
ttso...solid.  Nothing could rock that.
ttBut she didn't want to risk...

tThe hardest thing.  He's ever had to say...

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>tt...your hating me.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttCos she loves you.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttCos she loves <u>you</u>.  She wanted you
ttto have a daddy to love.  Even if
tthe didn't...completely...deserve it.

tNow the tears in his eyes.  And she's watching that.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttYou know how much love that is?
ttThat she has for you.

tDo you.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttThere's going to come a moment.
ttWhen she'll really need you to
ttgive that back.  And you're just
ttthe girl that can do it.

tThe way he says this.  Makes her ask...

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttNow do I know when?

tHe reaches.  First time.  Strokes her hair.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttThat moment will come.  And your
ttheart is going to whisper, 'here

tWinds his fingers.  Around her hand.

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttAnd you'll come through.

tShe stares in his eyes.  And dead straight.

</b>ttIf I miss it, daddy?  You clue

tOkay, he nods.  That's a plan.

<b>tINT. BAR - NIGHT

tThe dimly chic bar.  With its soft upscale buzz.  Where Jackie
ttold Luke she had cancer.  Tonight, she waits alone.  Watching the
tentrance.  Nursing her drink.  And then...

t...Rachel comes into the place.  Spots Jackie across the room.
tWeaves her way through the tables.

tAnd she is there.  Slipping into her seat.  Not knowing what to
tsay.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThanks for coming out.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttNeutral ground.  What's up?

tJackie stares evenly.  Her chin rests across the back of her

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttLuke called.  He says you're
ttchecking out.  Of the Heartbreak

tThe waitress appears.  Rachel too locked into the moment to notice.
tSo...

</b>ttShe likes a Stolie, no ice.

</b>ttt(softly)
ttDouble.

tAs the woman leaves...

<b>ttttJACKIE

ttI always liked that line.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttNo, there isn't.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAnd I have looked down the road.
ttAt what my life will be.  And I

tJackie unblinking.  Focused, strong.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWhat do you see?  Down that road.

tNo answer.  Then...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI never wanted to be a mom.  Then,

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttIs scary.  But you want it.  Gimme
ttsome truth here.

tThe Stolie arrives.  They wait a beat.  The waitress disappears.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWell, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome,
tthuh?  You die young, you always look
ttgolden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of
ttburnishes the image, and...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttCome on, a wuss like me?  The stiff
ttwho wouldn't help her own daughter
ttfight back?

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttMaybe I was wrong on that one.

tThat sits there.  In its sincerity.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWell, maybe you weren't.

tAnd so does that.  Tears are forming in Rachel's eyes.  Here, in
tthis public place.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttLook, when I said I couldn't channel
ttyou.  That didn't mean I wouldn't give
ttmy right arm to do just that.

tShakes her head.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttMaybe I don't want to be looking over
ttmy shoulder.  Every day for twenty
ttyears.  Knowing someone else would
tthave done it right.  The way I can't.

tJackie waits.  Thinks.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttTrade you a smoke.  For a secret.

tThe way she said that.  Something weighty behind it.  So Rachel
treaches into her purse.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou know, I lost Ben awhile back?
ttIn a supermarket.

tRachel's hand freezes.  In mid-course.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou're lying.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI lost him.  I was panicked.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou are lying, you never lost that
ttkid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him
ttfrom a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(smiles)
ttI was running around like a chicken

ttimitation of you.

tRachel still not buying...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBen never mentioned it.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttHe only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My

tThe smile fades.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWhy didn't I?

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttUh.  You hate my guts?

tPassing the cigarettes over.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWe were competing.  Even then.

tYes we were.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttInstead of being partners.  Watch-
tting each other's back.  Seeing things
ttwere covered.

tPulls out a smoke.  Offers the pack...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou're not scared <u>you'll</u> think you
ttdon't measure up.  You're scared
tt<u>they'll</u> think it.  That's the JFK

tRachel takes one.  Eye contact holding.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWith good reason.  They fucking
ttworship you as it is.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWhat do I have that you don't?

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttEverything.  You're...the Earth

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou're the hip and fresh.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou ride with Annabelle...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou'll learn.

</b>ttYou know every story, every wound,

</b>ttI have their past.

tSTRIKES the match.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou.  Have their future.

tRachel stunned.  By the simplicity of it all.  Slowly, she leans to
taccept Jackie's flame.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttDon't you get it?  You look down the
ttroad to her wedding.  You're in the
ttroom alone with her, fitting her veil,
ttfluffing her dress.  Telling her no
ttwoman was <u>ever</u> that beautiful.

tTears now.  Standing in two pairs of eyes.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAnd your fear is.  She'll be
ttthinking.  I wish Mom were here.

tJackie lights her own.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAnd mine is.  She won't.

tHer hand trembles as she takes a drag.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttNow that's enough fear for either
ttone of us to kill the other.  And
ttno jury in the <u>world</u> would convict.

tJackie raises her glass.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWe're guilty, girl.  Of being human.
ttAnd we can't forgive ourselves.

tHolds it forward.  In a toast.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttBut I forgive you.

tAnd slowly, Rachel lifts her own glass.  CLICKS it with Jackie's.

teverywhere, carols softly playing.  The whole nine yards.  Luke and
tBen standing at a wrapped bird cage, where a dove is cooing inside.
tAnnabelle is setting out the cocoa with a uniformed NURSE.

tRachel enters.  Kisses Annabelle's head.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI'm gonna check on Mom.

tGoes down the hall, every emotion in the world is playing across
ther face.  Into...

<b>tINT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM
</b>
tJackie lies on her death bed.  She is beautiful and near the end.
tDespite the IV tube, the monitor, she's gotten to serenity after
tall.  As close as any of us will ever get.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttHey, gorgeous.  Time for the
ttpresents?

tJackie licks her lips.  Pretty dry.  Rachel takes a cotton lemon
tswab from the nightstand.  Tenderly, cleans Jackie's mouth.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttNow Edna says you short-changed your
ttlast meds.  You can do presents and be
ttcomfortable at the same time, y'know.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(clears her throat)
ttJust want to be a little sharper.
ttFor a few minutes.

tA few minutes.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSome things to say.  To the kids,
tthuh?

tSmiles.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThen, bring in the presents.  We'll
tthave big fun.

tRachel can't really bear this.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou know, there's nothing you
tthave to say.  Because they know
ttyour heart.  You don't have t...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttJust sit me up.  Nice and tall.
ttBring Benjamin first.

tStaring at each other.  Then Rachel reaches her arms around
tJackie, and as gently as she can manage, lifts her to a full
tsitting position.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttScrapbook.

tRachel brings the big book.  Lays it on the bed.  And goes.

tJackie begins to turn the pages.  Her life with these children
tpassing before her eyes.  No tears.   No smile.  Just full
tattention.  Fingertips touch the one she was looking for, as...

tThe door OPENS.  Ben, hesitant, enters alone.  His mother's face is
tfine and strong and smiling.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttFind the bird cage?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(standing there)
ttRache says it's from you.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWell, don't make him disappear
ttbefore I see him.

tBen nods.  Okay, I won't.  She glances to the scrapbook...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttOh, look at this.

tAnd forgetting his uneasiness, he runs over, climbs ONTO the bed.
tJackie doesn't wince, doesn't even blink.  Nothing for his memory
tbank but smiles.  He looks at the photo...

t...Jackie holding a spunky newborn.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThat's you and me.  Our first photo
ttas a couple.

tHe nods.  Really staring at it.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttDid you know I was good-looking
ttright away?

tShe reaches to hold his face in her hand.  Stares in his eyes.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>tt<u>This</u> good-looking.  Was beyond
ttmy imagination.

tShe leans.  Kisses his lips lightly.  How many more times will she
tget to do this?

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(a murmur)
ttSo what do you think we're gonna
tttalk about?

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt(straight back)
ttYou dying.

tShe nods.  Her smile is right there.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThe secret of it.  That only
ttmagicians.  Can ever understand.

tHis eyes brighten.  The sadness pushed aside.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttSee, when we die.  Our body goes
ttaway.  Our body.  But <u>we</u>...we are
ttnot our body, are we?

tHe doesn't know.  Maybe he thought we were.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttIf a soldier loses his legs in a
ttwar.  Is he the same guy?  Sure
tthe is.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttBut you can still see him.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttHalf.  Of him.

tThis is so fucking hard.  But her eyes stay dry.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttDying.  Is where the <u>whole</u> body
ttgoes away.  So you can't see <u>any</u>
ttof it.  <u>But</u>...

tRests her hand tenderly.  On his hair.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWhat do magicians know?

tLeans forward.  Here's the secret...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttJust because you can't see it.
ttDoesn't.  Mean.  It's gone.

tDoes it?  And Ben smiles.  He is inside the secret.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThe world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But
ttonly the magician.  Knows better.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttSo where are you?

tShe was waiting for this.  For a long time.  She wraps her hand
taround his fist.  And puts their hands against his heart.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(a whisper)
ttRight here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u>
ttthe magician.  Shhhh.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttCan I talk to you?  When you're
ttthere.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAlways.  Always.  And you won't
tthear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll
ttknow.  What I'm saying.

tYes, you will.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttIt's not good enough.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttNo, it isn't.  Because it isn't
tteverything.  And we want every-
ttthing, don't we?

tHe nods.  They do.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttBut God does let us keep the <u>one</u>
ttbest thing we have together.  The
ttone <u>best</u> thing we've always had.
ttKnow what it is?

tHe doesn't.  But he wants to.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI love you.  And you love me.

tComes closer.  Nose to nose.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttIt's worth a lot.  Will you keep it?

tHe answers.  With a kiss.

<b>tINT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tLuke and Annabelle are doing a hugely complex jigsaw puzzle.  Ben
truns in, falls on his knees by the puzzle.  Without looking at
tAnnabelle, he tells her...

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttYour turn.  It wasn't bad.

tAnnabelle looks straight to her dad.  There is a moment, a silence,
tthat no one else could ever understand.  She leans to him and
twhispers...

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttHere it is?

tHis eyes water.  He takes her in his arms.  Whispers close to her
tear, only the words...

<b>ttttLUKE
</b>ttHere it is.

tShe smiles at hi.  Fear gone, filled with resolve.  Gives him a
tkiss.  Rises, to...

t...follow Rachel down the hall.  Rache wraps an arm around her big
tgirl.  No words, except a murmured...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou can do this.

tVoice cracking.  She's not as good at it as this girl's mother.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou can do anything.

tAt the door.  Open it, and...

<b>tINT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM
</b>
t...Annabelle enters alone.  The door closes behind her.  Her eyes
tlock with her mother's.  No words.  Annabelle's eyes filled with
ttears, and Jackie's arms...

t... REACH out, and Annabelle RUNS to them.

tThey hold each other.  For a forever moment.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI don't want to say goodbye.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttDon't. Take me with you.

tAnd Annabelle looks up.  Tears on her face.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThank God.  I got to see you.
ttGrown up.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI'm not.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttt(very softly)
ttLet me be the judge of that.

tAnd Annabelle climbs onto the bed.  Their hands never stop touching
teach other.  Saying I love you.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThere's an amazing thing when a
ttwoman has a daughter.  One day you
ttlook up, and you see...a sister.
ttSomeone.  You can say.  Anything to.

tAnything.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttI wrote a whole lot of letters.  To
tteach of you.  And the envelope says
ttwhen to open it.  Like, which
ttbirthday.  Or...when you get your
ttdriver's permit.  First time you see
ttRome.  Things like that.

tThings like that.  Annabelle is beginning to lose it now.  So
tJackie says only...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttKeep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until
tthe's old enough to not open them all
ttat once.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttUntil he's old enough to read.

tTears on Annabelle's face.  Her mom wonders...

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttAre you afraid for me?  Where
ttI'm going.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttDon't be.  I'm going.  Where we
ttall go.  Now how can that be bad.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttI'll miss you so much.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttGood.  That's very good.

tShe nods, yes it is.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWhat you're grown-up enough to
ttknow.  Is that people.  Can do
tt<u>two</u> things at once.  Okay?

tShe brushes at her baby's tears.  Then tastes her wet fingertips.
tMmmn, surprisingly good.  Annabelle sort of smiles.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou can miss me.  And.  Take me
ttwith you.

tHold the child's face.  In her hands.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttWhen you're in trouble.  Have me
ttthere.  When you fall in love.
ttHave me there.  You can.

tSaid with such absolute assurance.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttThat's how we go on, you know.
ttForever.  Because someone takes
ttus along.

tAnnabelle swallows hard.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttOn your wedding night.  When your
ttbabies are born.  I want to be
ttthere.  Will you take me?

tA straight question.  It needs an answer.

<b>ttttANNABELLE
</b>ttAlways, always.  Always.

tA sigh.  A shared smile.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttYou made my life wonderful.

tYou.

<b>ttttJACKIE
</b>ttTake that with you, too.

tHold.  On Annabelle.

<b>tINT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT MORNING
</b>
tThe presents are here now, they fill up the room, spill over the
tbed, where both children sprawl.

t...Ben RIPPING the shit out of wrappings like a wolverine,
tAnnabelle carefully saving her gift paper as if she were going to
thang it in the Louvre.  She holds a tank top up to her chest, for
ther Mom's approval.  Jackie's not sure.  Rachel handing up more
tboxes, Luke in charge of bagging trash...

tBen's white dove, flying free around the room, zipping and diving.
tNo one cares.  It's Christmas.

tHOLD.  Hold.  And CROSSFADE TO...

<b>tEXT. CHAPEL - NIGHT
</b>
tFamily and friends are leaving the wake, exiting the softly-lit
tchapel into a snowy night.  They are saying goodbyes, kissing one
tanother, going to their cars.  And saying her last goodbye...

t...Rachel turns to Luke.  Whispers, close to his ear.  He looks at
ther for a beat, then leads Annabelle and Ben toward the car, as...

tRachel goes back into the chapel.  Alone.

<b>tINT. FUNERAL PARLOR
</b>
tThe room is nearly dark.  One soft spot plays on a simple CASKET.
tNo canned organ music, no sound at all.  As Rachel enters.

tShe goes to the casket.  Stares down at it for a beat.  And just
tabove a whisper...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttSee, I told you I'd do this.

tOnly...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttOnly.  Now I don't know what to say.

tHer hand reaches out.  A finger absently traces the edge of the
twood.  It seems a gesture of unconscious affection.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttYou'd have written it down, so you
ttwouldn't blow it.

tA slight smile.  Here's where the love shows.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttMaybe we should change places.

tNods slightly.  Maybe we should.  She takes a step back now, to a
twaiting chair.

tSits.  Her hands folded in her lap.  Thinks.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWell.  We were less than friends, I
ttguess.  And more.

tMore.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWe were never...girlfriends, we
ttnever dished.  That wasn't.  What
ttwe had.

tNo apology there.  It's just the truth.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWe had some battles, man, they
ttwere...world class, huh?
ttt(beat)
ttAnd I don't regret a one of them.

tSad little shrug.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI miss them.

tThinking.  Of how much more she'll miss.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttWe've got our secrets, we have.
ttAnd I'll keep 'em if you will.

tCrosses her arms.  Lost in the moment.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttBut I wish we had one more night.
ttIn that little bar, remember?
ttRemember that toast?  Sure, you do.

tHer voice wavers.  But the eyes are dry.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttKnow what?  I forgive me, too.
ttSee?  <u>You're</u> the magician.

tA murmur...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttDon't worry, partner, I've got
ttyour back.  We're covered.

tIt's what she came to say.  CROSSFADE TO...

<b>tINT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tLights and music and laughter.  They're in black tie tonight.  It's
ta wedding party.  Up on the stage, at the head table, some guy is
tfinishing a toast, and as everyone ROARS and CLAPS...

<b>ttttBEST MAN
</b>tt...so TO THE BRIDE!  Thank GOD
ttshe's more than he deserves!

tEverybody shouts THE BRIDE.  Everybody drinks champagne.

tAnd the bride stands up. In her white gown.  In her hand, an
tenvelope.  She goes to the mike, and waits for the raucous cheers,
tthe calls of SPEECH!, to die down.

tLeans to the mike.  Flushed and happy.  And, oddly, nervous.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttNow I know the tradition, so
ttthis isn't a toast.  At least...
ttnot for me.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttThe guest list is 114.  But we
ttall know there's one more here,
tttonight.  Because...

tLooks down the table at her children.  Dressed to kill.  Enjoying
tthe party.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>tt...my two sidekicks there always
ttbring her along.  Wherever they go.

tRight?  Right.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttSo Jackie and I were sitting
ttaround.  On New Year's Eve.  And
ttshe said, 'You're not gonna talk
ttat my funeral, are you?'

tAnd now.  It is quiet indeed.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttAnd I said, 'I've never been to
tta funeral.  I'm not sure I'll know
tthow to act...'

tHer sweet smile.  Keeps the mood right.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>tt'...but I'll prob'ly sneak into
ttwhere you are.  Just before it's
ttover...'

tNods to herself.  Fights back the feeling of that moment.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>tt'...say something.  Just to you.
ttGet the last word in, when you
ttcan't talk back.'

tThere is laughter in this room.  Gentle, loving.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttSo she says, 'No way.'

tHolds up the envelope.  Holds it tight.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttShe wrote this.  She sealed it
ttup, I didn't see it.  She made
ttme promise to read it.  At the
ttwedding.

tAnd slowly, Luke begins to CLAP.  And others join.  And when it
tstops...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttI told her she'd better make it
ttdirty, or make it funny.  Because...
ttno way...on my wedding...

tNo way in hell.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>tt...could she make me cry.

tAPPLAUSE.  They are loving it.

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttShe says, 'It's a deal'.

tThe band plays an impromptu FLOURISH.  Rachel begins to carefully
ttear open the envelope...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttNow, if it's too raunchy, we may
tthave to excuse the kids...

tSHOUTS from everyone, ESPECIALLY the children.

tShe has it open.  She looks at it.

tAnd everything.  Stops.

tThe world watches her sway, watches her eyes fill as she stares at
tthe small card in her hand.  She can't believe this...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttt(mouths to herself)
ttYou promised.

tThe tears are welling.  Everyone SCREAMS for her to read it.  She
tleans to the mike, shaking her head...

<b>ttttRACHEL
</b>ttIt's...no big thing, really...
ttit's just...five words, it's...

tThe place goes happily UP FOR GRABS.  A joyful RIOT of demand.
tTears STREAMING now, Rachel fumbles to pull up her white beaded
tbag.  As she puts the card inside, we alone can read the words...

<b>tMY BABIES.  ARE SO LUCKY.
</b>
tHOLD on this.  And...

<b>tFADE TO BLACK.  ROLL END CREDITS.
