<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tA DREAM:
</b>
<b>tINT. STABLES; PILGRIM'S STALL - MORNING
</b>
tSunlit illuminates the darkened stable, highlighting the 
tcontours of a magnificent HORSE (PILGRIM) in surreal, dream-
tlike imagery: his legs, his muscles, his sheen, his mane... 
this eyes. He shakes his head and stamps his feet. He seems 
tconfined. Eager to run.

<b>tINT. STABLES - MORNING
</b>
tPilgrim bursts through the stall and runs out the stables 
tinto a blinding white morning.

<b>tEXT. AN OPEN FIELD LEADING TO WOODS - BRIGHT MORNING
</b>
tWhiteness. Snow and sky without any discernible line between.

tCamera is POV, as if on the horse, riding through the 
twhiteness. Snow kicks up from the side. We hear the breathing 
tof the horse. As we travel on hills, through trees, we 
texperience of sense of wild, exhilarating freedom.

tWe hear the giggles of a GIRL (GRACE) on the horse. An 
toccasional line;

<b>tttt  GRACE (O.S.)
</b>ttYeah, fly boy... that's it... go... 
ttgo... go...

tEND OF DREAM as we CUT TO:

<b>tINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
tGrace awakens, calmly. Takes a breath. Slides out of bed and 
tstands before a window, overlooking a beautiful Connecticut 
tcountry house. We see a snow-covered field and distant woods. 
tGrace presses her faces against the cold, frosted window 
teager to get out.

<b>tINT. MACLEAN NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>
tAlarm rings, ANNIE MACLEAN awakens. She shuts the alarm and 
tscoots up in bed. She waits. Seconds later the television 
tacross the foot of her bed turns on from a timer -- to a CNN 
t24 NEWS channel.

<b>tINT. HALLWAY/ANNIE & ROBERT'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
tGrace, fully dressed except for her boots, tiptoes past a 
tpartially opened bedroom door. Her father ROBERT is asleep, 
talone, on his huge king size bed.

<b>tINT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
tGrace is putting on her boots on a bench beside a back door. 
tShe is wearing her mother's outfit. As she slides the boot 
ton, we see behind her a row of framed photos -- Robert, Grace 
tand Annie in happy times.

tShe slaps a note on the refrigerator, with a magnet -- "Gone 
triding. Back around 10. Love, G."

<b>tEXT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE, BACK ENTRANCE - MORNING
</b>
tGrace slips on her jacket and hat as she comes down the 
tsteps, her feet hitting the walk...

<b>tEXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING
</b>
tAnnie's feet hit the ground, running -- her breath showing in 
tthe cold air. She passes other joggers with ease. She crosses 
tthe street and heads for an elegant CPW building.

<b>tINT. MACLEAN'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>
tDressed in running clothes, Annie opens the door and picks up 
tseveral newspapers that were delivered. She carries them into 
tthe kitchen and sets them beside a huge stack of publications, 
tmagazines, papers, etc... Knowing she must read all of them at 
tsome point, she breathes a disgusted sign. She thumbs through 
tthe POST as she pours herself a cup of coffee. Something 
tcatches her eyes and she snarls:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThat little shit!

tShe dials a portable phone and moves through the apartment as 
tshe talks:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHi Lucy?... Did I wake you?... Have 
ttyou read the Post?... They've got a 
ttlittle item about me and Fiske. He's 
ttsaying I fired him and that I faked 
ttthe new circulation figures.. Ha, ha... 
ttOh, please... It's the last act of a 
ttdesperate gnome... Set up a phone call 
ttwith Don Farlow for 9:30...

tThroughout the phone call, Annie is selecting clothes, 
tturning on the shower, undressing...

<b>tEXT. DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING
</b>
tThe snow has stopped falling. Grace walks along a hill, hands 
tin pocket. Spread out on the landscape are horses, on a horse 
tfarm, standing like statues in the white covered fields.

tAs Grace comes along the hill, we see another GIRL (JUDITH) 
tcoming from the opposite direction. She doesn't have Grace's 
tlean elegance but her warm, friendly smile brightens her 
tface. Upon reaching her, Grace returns the smile with a hug.

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b>ttIt's warmer than I thought.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttYou want to go to a movie tonight?

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b>ttI thought your mom's coming up?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt(prickly)
ttSo?

tJudith immediately senses a problem so she continues casually, 
tas they begin walking away from Camera...

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b>ttMy parents are having friends from 
ttcollege over. They're really nice... 
ttThey have this gorgeous son who wants 
ttto be a forest ranger.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttCan I come? I'll start a fire...

tJudith laughs as they continue talking, their voices trailing 
toff, as the girls head for the stables.

<b>tINT. STABLES, THE DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING
</b>
tThere are several horses in their stalls. Grace and Judith 
tenter, talking, carrying their English saddles. Judith stops 
tat a stall, disappearing into it as she says "Hello?"..., 
tGrace continues to the end stall.

tPilgrim (the horse from the dream) stands looking at her.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttHello, beautiful boy.

tHe's a massive figure beside her but she shows no inhibition. 
tShe enters, touching his muzzle. He plays with her by nudging 
ther back.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttStop... Will you stop!

<b>tEXT. DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING
</b>
tThey lead their horses, now saddled and ready, from the barn. 
tPilgrim tosses his head, prancing, playing with the snow.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttShow-off.

tThe girls mount the horses and ride off together.

<b>tINT. ANNIE'S MAGAZINE OFFICE - MID-MORNING
</b>
tAnnie, casually dressed, enters the empty offices of her 
tmagazine. She turns on the light, revealing a large row of 
tstalls and glassed in private offices. Everywhere we look, we 
tsee indications of the kind of magazine she edits.

tShe strolls to her office -- the largest -- surrounded by 
twindows. The office walls are covered with photos, most of 
twhich are COVER STORIES ON ANNIE.

t(One photo is of Annie's father MARTIN. A BRITISH AMBASSADOR 
twith his young daughter on his lap, her arms affectionately 
taround his neck. Her mother stands right behind them, posing 
tlike a member of the royal family.)

tAnnie sits and takes a breath. The only photo on her desk is 
ta family portrait, taken when Annie was given the Crystal 
tAward -- Robert, Grace, herself and the Award. She checks her 
twatch -- it is almost 9:30.

<b>tINT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM/CLOSET - MID-MORNING
</b>
tA WALK-IN CLOSET of the master bedroom; one side is Annie's, 
tone side is Robert's.

tRobert stands before his bureau in the closet -- he has just 
tshowered and is putting on his watch and ring which lay 
tbeside his cologne assortment. A FRAMED PHOTO OF HE AND ANNIE 
tin India -- younger, vibrant, in love... when they first met.

tTHE PHONE RINGS. Robert enters into the bedroom to pick up.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttHello?

tINSERT ANNIE: They speak in dulled, emotionless voices:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIt's me.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttHi.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHi.

tAwkward pause.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttSo, what, uh, what train are you taking?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI should be in by two.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttOkay. You want me to pick you up?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttSure... What's Grace up to?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttRiding with Judith.

tBeat.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't 
tthave brought it up over the phone.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttThat's okay. We have to talk about it 
ttand we're not always in the same place
tt... so... I just have to get used to it.
ttt(beat)
ttWhat do you want to do about dinner?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI don't know. We'll figure it out.

tPause. There is a lot unspoken but understood between them. 
tAnnie's other phone line rings. Robert hears it as well.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttOkay. We'll see you later then.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYeah. Bye.

tAnnie picks up the other line and her manner brightens, her 
tenergy boosts...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDON! My love, how are you? Did you hear 
ttabout Fiske?... No, suing is too 
ttcivilized. Can't we get your friend at Le 
ttCirque to serve him a fatal piece of 
ttpoached salmon?... Ha, ha... That's even 
ttbetter...

<b>tEXT. CONNECTICUT COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING
</b>
tLong Shot of the girls riding at an easy pacing, talking all 
tthe time. Grace is an elegant rider, quite self-assured for a 
t13-year-old... We come into the scene at the moment the 
tgirls have just shared a secret or a fantasy. Judith is 
tgiggling uncontrollably. Grace laughs as she says:

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>tt...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b>ttI just could never say it!

tThey stop at the end of the field, facing the woods.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttDo you want to go around by the 
ttold road?

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b>ttWhy don't we just cut through the 
ttwoods?

tGrace nods. They ride into the woods, continuing their talk.

<b>tEXT. WOODS - MORNING
</b>
tThe girls ride down, along a stand of hickories and poplars 
tto a RIVER. They stop the horses and their conversation, to 
tlisten to the sound of the water. Below them, off in the 
tdistance, they can just make out a two-lane country road.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttYou want to go down or stay along 
ttthe river?

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b>ttWe already did the river. Let's go down 
ttand across the old bridge. We can circle 
ttback.

tThey begin to make their way.

<b>tINT. ANNIE'S OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
tAnnie's office is now crowded with a dozen or so employees; 
tsitting on the couch, on the window sills, on the arms of 
tchairs, against the walls... Paper bag emptied of bagels, 
tcream cheese, orange juice, paper plates...

tHand Held Camera captures the energy of the room as it 
tfollows overlapping lines, laughter, etc... yet, no matter how 
tcasual it all seems, Annie is very much at the center of 
tcontrol... We enter the scene of LAUGHTER, as Annie asks 
tKEVIN, a feature writer:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>tt... So what did you say to her?

<b>tttt  KEVIN
</b>ttI said, thank you very much...
<b>ttt(LAUGHTER, AD LIBS)
</b>ttI really should do the interview... But 
ttperhaps if you'd like to have dinner...

tLAUGHTER... Everyone starts Ad Libbing...

<b>tttt  VARIOUS CHARACTERS
</b>ttDinner!!... He's so cute.... Why don't I 
ttget those kind of interviews?... Look, 
tthe has husband number eight written on 
tthis forehead...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttAll right, all right, all right... Kevin, 
ttgood job. Write the interview. If I don't 
ttlike it, you may have to sleep with her 
ttfor a follow-up!
ttt(laughter)
ttNow... I'm thinking about another fashion 
ttdesigner spread... Who's news out there?

tCharacters shout out designer names and comments as the phone 
trings and LUCY picks up... speaking amdist the talking...

<b>tttt  LUCY
</b>ttHold on.
ttt(presses hold)
ttGottschalk.

tThe room goes dead quiet, instantly. Then erupts in laughter 
tas everyone realizes it. Annie, however, waves her hand as 
tshe takes the phone...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttQuiet... Quiet!

tEveryone obeys. Annie presses SPEAKER PHONE.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDavid?

<b>tttt  DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
</b>ttWho's there?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttEveryone. Working overtime. Just for you.

<b>tttt  DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
</b>ttDid you speak to Farlow?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYes. We're suing.

<b>tttt  DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
</b>ttIs that absolutely necessary? It'll just 
ttmake it a bigger story.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDavid, he signed an agreement that he 
ttwouldn't talk to the press and he's 
ttlibeled me by saying I faked the figures. 
ttYou're not going soft on me, are you?

tSilence. Gottschalk doesn't immediately respond. Everyone 
twaits. Covert looks between characters suggest this is 
tinteresting -- has Annie over-stepped her bounds with the 
tmagazine's owner? Annie waits without a shred of anxiety -- 
teven though she might have some. Finally:

<b>tttt  DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)
</b>ttWell, I suppose we could use another 
ttgood public feud...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttExactly...

tEveryone silently acknowledges Annie guts and influence.

<b>tEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING
</b>
tIt's perfectly still. We are looking down an empty TWO-LANE 
tROAD covered with fresh snow. We see the girls slowly riding 
tout of the woods, talking. They cross the road and start up 
tinto the woods on the other side... They are trying to sing a 
tLIZ PHAIR song, "CHOPSTICKS"

<b>tttt  GRACE/JUDITH
</b>ttt(singing)
tt"I met him at a party and he told me how 
tthe like to drive me home... He said he 
ttliked to do it backwards..."

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt(singing)
tt"... I said it--"

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b>t tt(singing)
tt"... and I said that"...

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt(stops singing)
ttNo, wait, it just goes... "he said he 
ttliked to do-"...

tSuddenly there's the SOUND OF THE METAL OF JUDITH'S HORSE 
tscraping on some sheer ice hidden under the soft snow. Judith 
tnotices first...

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b>ttWhat was --

tThe horse staggers... Judith looks to Grace --

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b>ttGrace!

tThe horse tries to find tracing with his hindfeet, kicking 
tup sprays of snow and ice shards. The horse suddenly falls on 
tthe ice and goes down hard on its knees...

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b><b>ttJUDITH!
</b>
tThe horse stumbles to get back on its feet, slipping again. 
tFrightened, it rears and Judith, caught off balance, is 
tthrown, her foot catching in the stirrup...

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b><b>ttGRAAACE!
</b>
tHer horse, unable to find its balance, starts to slide backward 
tdown the incline.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b><b>ttPILGRIM, COME ON! MOVE!
</b>
tGrace, directly behind Judith, tries to turn Pilgrim to avoid 
tbeing hit by the errant horse.

tWhat follows, we see from Grace's perspective. The details 
tthat form the images and sounds of Grace's mind are fast, 
tdisembodies, almost surreal as --

tJudith's horse bulldozes into Pilgrim, taking his legs out 
tfrom under him, sending both horses careening down the icy 
tslope. Grace hangs onto Pilgrim's neck. Judith, her leg 
thelplessly tangled in the stirrup, is dragged, her head 
tbouncing on the frozen ground.

tThey slide all the way back down to the COUNTRY ROAD. Pilgrim 
tis the first to find his legs and stand. Grace manages to sit 
tup in the saddle. She sees Judith's horse stumbling back onto 
tits feet, one of his legs broken at the ankles, walking in 
tconfused circles, dragging Judith -- her face bleeding, her 
tleg hanging from the stirrup.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt(frightened)
ttJude, you okay?

<b>tttt  JUDITH
</b>ttt(softly, crying)
ttI'm okay... I'm okay.

tShe tries to extricate her leg from the stirrup.

tGrace sees it before she hears it. A GLINT off of steel. We 
tthen hear the rumbling SOUND of a TRUCK coming around the 
tbend... The Girls on their horses in the middle of the road... 
tThe Truck, an 18 wheeler carrying logging equipment, comes 
taround the turn... Grace grabs the bridle, trying to get 
tJudith's horse out of the road... The driver, seeing them, lays 
ton the air horn. The Horses bolt at the sound, the bridle 
tslipping out of Grace's hand...

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b><b>ttJUUDE!!!
</b>
t... The horses turn apart. The Driver starts furiously 
tdownshifting, trying to brake... He seems to get it under 
tcontrol when suddenly THE TRUCK SKIDS on some ice. It begins 
tto slide, out of control, the truck bed and the cab jack-
tknifing. The truck literally plows over the helpless Judith 
tand her horse -- the horse going down on the pavement, Judith 
tdisappearing under him. The truck's cab, like a mythic 
tmonster, heads right for Grace and Pilgrim... Grace looks 
tright into the Driver's helpless, frightened eyes... Suddenly, 
tPilgrim rears up at the truck, sending Grace flying, bouncing 
ther off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck.

tPilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck, his 
thooves caught between the rear-view mirrors like some 
tgrotesque ornament. His head and chest slams into the window, 
tshattering through the glass.

tAnd then it is still.

tThe truck has stopped halfway in the road. Judith's horse 
tlies in the road, motionless. Pilgrim, on the truck's hood, 
this legs splayed, stuck, his head and chest, bleeding. He 
tshrieks, struggling to get to his feet. He manages to free 
this legs and, stepping off the cab onto the road, walks off, 
twounded, in pain, into the sanctuary of the woods...

tThe Driver stumbles out of the cab, his head bleeding, in 
tshock. He sits on the ground. All we hear is the sound of the 
triver and the wind in the trees.

tGrace, halfway under the truck, frozen, stares up at the 
tbeautiful morning sky.

<b>tWE HEAR THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER...
</b>
<b>tINT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER MORNING
</b>
tANGLE ON GRACE'S NOTE on the refrigerator as Robert enters 
tfrom the outside with two bags of groceries. He places them on 
tthe counter near the PHONE MACHINE. He sees ONE MESSAGE is 
tthere. He presses PLAY as he puts away the groceries.

tA BEAT LATER the PHONE RINGS and he picks up, with the machine 
tstill playing...

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttt(on phone)
ttHello? Paul, hi -- are you guys back? 
ttHow was it? Oh that sounds great. Oh 
ttPaul.. hold on...

<b>tttt  LIZ
</b>ttt(on machine)
ttRobert! Are you there?... Robert! It's 
ttLiz!... Look, there's... there's been 
ttan accident... Uh... Jesus... uh...

tAs Robert listens, the voice of Liz's on the machine from 
tinside, pulls his attention. On hearing "accident," Robert 
tlowers the receiver, frozen, as he listens to Liz...

<b>tttt  LIZ
</b>ttt(on machine)
 ttRobert, just call me on my call phone... 
<b> tt1-917-449-7805...
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE WOODS - LATE MORNING
</b>
tPilgrim is hiding in the shadows under an old railroad bridge, 
tstanding up to his knees in the river. His chest is cut open, 
tbleeding. His face cut, contorted and swollen. LIZ HAMMOND, 
tthe local veterinarian, hides a hypodermic needle in her 
tjacket, quietly walking into the water.

tA Policeman is going into the water downstream from Pilgrim, 
twhose chest is heaving, blood drips into the water. He 
twatches Liz. She is almost to him when suddenly he bolts, 
trunning upstream.

tThe Policeman behind him shouts and waves his arm. Frightened, 
tPilgrim wheels back toward Liz, who manages to stick the hypo 
tin his neck. He rears, knocking her down, then runs out of 
tthe river, the hypo still in his neck. He runs for the 
tsanctuary of the woods.

<b>tINT. TRAIN - LATE MORNING
</b>
tAnnie sits on a train -- her laptop out, notes beside her, 
ther cellular phone, ever-ready. The train passes through 
tbeautiful countryside but Annie is focused on an editorial 
tshe's writing.

tThe train pulls into a station and stops, causing Annie to 
ttake a break and stretch her arms and neck. She looks out the 
twindow for the first time and sees:

tA MAN, his hands in his pockets, waiting on the platform. She 
twatches as the Man holds out his arms to his two young 
tchildren, who are getting off the train. He picks them up as 
this wife enters the scene, kissing him and wrapping her arm 
taround his waist. The children talk a mile a minute and the 
tfather listens to every word.

tAnnie doesn't even realize she is staring. As they leave the 
tplatform, she turns back to her laptop. As the train begins 
tto move again, Annie returns to work.

tHER CELLULAR PHONE RINGS. She answers.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYeah?... Hi. I made the 1:00 so...

tThe expression on her face sinks into a stunned panic.

<b>tINT. HOSPITAL, CONNECTICUT - DAY
</b>
tAnnie is running through the corridors, her bags in tow. She 
tsees Robert standing in the corridor talking to a DOCTOR. She 
truns for them.

tWhen she appears, Robert and the Doctor stop their 
tconversation. Robert looks to Annie, who is waiting for news.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b><b>ttWHAT!?
</b>
tRobert is teary eyed, beaten down.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttJudith's dead.

tAnnie's horrified, waiting for news of Grace.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat about Grace?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttShe was in pretty bad shape. They've 
ttdone a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some 
tthemorrhaging...

<b>tttt  DOCTOR
</b>ttBut nothing we can't handle...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(impatient)
ttWhere is she now?

<b>tttt  DOCTOR
</b>ttSurgery.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttSurgery! For what-?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttt(interrupting)
ttAnnie, her leg was shattered -- what 
ttthey call the distal epi.. epi..

<b>tttt  DOCTOR
</b>ttDistal epicondyle of the femur...

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttt(quietly, crying)
ttThey have to take the leg off.

tAnnie responds without tears and cries but with a quiet 
tshock. We can tell her mind is racing, trying to process the 
tinformation, until finally she asks:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhich leg?

tThe Doctor and Robert are surprised by the question.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttWhat difference does it make?

tAnnie stares for a beat, then nods apologetically.

<b>tEXT. WOODS - DAY
</b>
tPilgrim is sedated, lying in his own blood in the snow, 
tsurrounded by Police and trackers. He is being attended to by 
tLIZ HAMMOND, who is dictating to her assistant:

<b>tttt  LIZ
</b>tt... His skull, cheek, and nose are 
ttseverely fractured. He has a deep 
ttchest wound. I'm not even sure it 
ttcan be closed.

<b>tttt  LOCAL TRACKER
</b>ttt(deadpan, local accent)
ttAnimal should be put down -- anybody can 
ttsee that.

tLiz looks up to him, resentfully, but knows he's right.

<b>tINT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
tCamera moves from Grace's face down her body to Robert's 
thand, which rubs her good leg. He looks at her lovingly, 
tpushing the hair from her forehead.

tAnnie, needing to do something, tenderly straightens Grace's 
tblankets. It is plain to see where her leg had once been. 
tRobert can't look. Annie, one to face her fears, bravely 
tlooks at it head on. She notices the I.V. Bag and rises on:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThat bag's almost empty.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttt(looking)
ttNo, it's got a little left. They'll be 
ttin to change it.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(as she exits)
ttRobert, you leave it up these people...!

tRobert is about to respond but Annie is already out the door. 
tWe hear the O.S. DIALOGUE as Robert listens.

<b>tttt  ANNIE (O.S.)
</b>ttExcuse me, my daughter needs a new 
<b>ttI.V.
</b>
<b>tttt  NURSE (O.S.)
</b>ttWe have her down, we'll be right in.

<b>tttt  ANNIE (O.S.)
</b>ttI'd like it taken care of now please.

tAnnie enters first.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou have to keep on top of these people 
ttor else they just sit on their --

tBut Robert is ignoring her. Facing Grace, smoothing away her 
thair. He's giving her the silent treatment. Annie knows this 
tmeans Robert doesn't approve of her dictatorial behavior. 
tAnnoyed, she turns away as well.

tThe Nurse enters with a new bag and begins to replace the old 
tone as Robert backs away.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI'm sorry.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttTch. What are you --

tAnnie, about to respond to his inappropriate politeness, is 
tstopped by Robert, who finally looks at her. It's a powerful 
tlook that tells her to calm down and shut up. It's a look 
tthat, for all of Robert's sensitivity, affects Annie. She 
tgets the message and stays calm.

tAs the nurse leaves, Annie is about to say thank you, but 
tRobert beats her to it.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttThank you.

tAnnie and Robert stand facing each other, when the PHONE RINGS. 
tAnnie picks up.

</b>ttt(journalistic)
ttHer leg was shattered so they had to,

ttknow you're being hit with a low now, 
ttI don't want to take too much of your

tAnnie hears the name as if it's some distant echo she can't 
tquite identify; Liz speaks quickly as Annie watches Grace 
tbreathing in her sleep --

<b>tttt  LIZ
</b>ttIt's not good. I've never seen an animal 
ttwith these injuries still breathing. I 
ttknow this is difficult to hear right now 
ttI'd like your permission to put him down.

tt  t(softer)
ttPlease.

tLiz is stopped by Annie's almost pleading tone.

<b>tttt  LIZ
</b>ttAll right...

tThey hang up. Annie takes a breath. Robert re-enters.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat did he say?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttNothing new. He's just going off duty.

tBeat. Silence.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI'm going to get all the nurses'

ttnames.

tRobert nods. But neither of them moves. They stand motionless 
tfor a beat, then Annie begins to break down and eases herself 
tinto Robert's arms.

tRobert embraces her, kissing her head, with an almost fatherly 
tcomfort. His expression tells us it's the moment he's been 
texpecting... and wanting. Now she'll be all right, in his arms. 
tWhatever distance between them, whatever problems felt 
tinsurmountable last night on the phone, are now, for the moment 
t-- for Robert -- gone.

tBut Annie's expression tells us something different. Her 
tinstinct to hold him was honest... but the effect isn't the 
tsame anymore. Something doesn't feel right. Something isn't 
tworking anymore about his comforting embrace.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI should go get some of her things.

tA line of recovery stalls with various sick and hurt animals. 
tLiz, exhausted asleep, on a chair outside a stall. There's a 
tslight scratching sound. A hoof against the stall. It gets 
tlouder, awakening Liz. She gets up and looks inside the 
tpaddled stall:

tPilgrim is lying in the stall, heavily bandaged. He is waking 
tup. His first instinct is to kick at the paddled stall walls. 
tHe looks at Liz, his eyes filled with madness -- enraged to

<b>tINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM IN FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

tAnnie opens the door and enters, flicking on the light. 
tCamera is on her back, as she places a small suitcase on the 
tbed and opens it. She begins her task with cool efficiency. 
tOpening drawers and closets, assessing what should be taken, 
twhat isn't necessary.

tSuddenly, she stops. She feels disoriented for a moment. She 
tcan't remember the last time she was inside this room. She 
ttakes a moment to pause and actually look around.

tIn the light, we now see more of Grace's inner sanctum. Horse 
triding prize ribbons in various colors adorn the walls. 
tBooks. A girl's bureau cluttered with teenage possession 
tranging from childhood toys to items that suggest a reaching 
ttowards adulthood. Annie examines some items, affectionately. 
tA GOOD LUCK CHARM from India sits among her things. Annie 
ttakes it to pack in the suitcase.

tShe notices a framed 8X10 of Grace sitting proudly atop 
tPilgrim with Judith at her heel. She then notices the edge of 
tanother picture behind this one, in the frame. She pulls the 
tPilgrim photo out to reveal: An old 8X10 of Annie hugging 
tGrace as a toddler. With her back to Camera, Annie remembers:

<b>tMEMORY:

tAnnie is playing with toddler Grace. Chasing her around the 
troom. Picking her and tossing her onto a small, toddler bed.

</b>
tAnnie slides the Pilgrim picture back into the frame, then 
treturns to her task of packing.

<b>tINT. GRACE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tAnnie enters. No one else is there. She places the suitcase 
ton a chair and opens it. She takes out the INDIAN LUCKY CHARM 
tand some horse books, and places them on her bedside table. 
tShe takes care to prop up the Lucky Charm.

tShe wets a cloth with some water from a pitcher and gently 
twipes Grace's sweaty brow... INSERT VISUAL FLASHBACK HERE, 
tinstead of in Country House.

tAnnie then continues unpacking the suitcase. She opens 
tGrace's closet and sees a hospital bag filled with Grace's 
tclothes at the time of the accident. Annie examines them and 
tdiscovers they are hers. Annie shoves the clothes into a bag 
tand starts unpacking.

tThe Clock is ticking on the wall. The cafeteria is empty 
texcept for one tired Intern, drinking coffee on a break.

tRobert and Annie are having a cup of coffee. In the silence, 
tthey search for things to say. Until:

</b>ttI saw Judith's parents while you were

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>tt... And uh... Mario called about moving 
ttthe wisteria?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh. Right. I'll call him.

tPause. Annie looks at her husband as he stares off to the

tfidgets with the napkins. She remembers:

</b>ttYou can hardly get your arms around me. 
ttHow depressing. You're so early.

tThe room's lights are dimmed. Dawn is being to break through.

tGrace, slowly, opens her eyes coming out of sedation. She 
ttakes a moment to figure out where she is... to remember.

tShe uses her hands to hoist herself up, but she's unsteady 
tand knocks into her bedside table -- knocking the Good Luck 
tCharm from India off the table. It rolls under the bed, with 
ta water tumbler. Grace never sees the Charm.

tGrace looks where her leg once was. She feels the blanket, 
tthe empty space where her leg once was... just like her mother 
tdid (did her father couldn't). Instead of self-pity, she's 
toddly fascinated.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:

tDaylight pours in. Robert and Annie enter. Robert, loaded 
twith gifts, immediately crosses to Grace, on the side of her 
tgood leg. Annie takes her position beside the lost leg. 
tRobert kisses his daughter;

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttHi, sweetheart...

tAnnie's hand finds Grace's hand, and holds one of her fingers 
ttightly. Grace responds by wrapping her hand around her 
tmother's. They exchange a look of respect and gratitude.

</b>ttHave you heard from Judith's parents?

</b>ttNo, not yet.

ttTake your time. You tell us... But he

tAnnie exits first, carrying a jacket for Grace. She is 
tfollowed by Robert, who immediately turns to help Grace. We

</b>ttYou all go ahead. I'll be up by

</b>ttYou've got to stop doing that?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttDoing what?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHelping all the time! Running to her

ttAnticipating her all the time.

tRobert shuts off his sink and dries his face, without a word. 
tHe exits into the bedroom, and gets into bed. For a beat, he 
tstares up at the ceiling -- then says quite plainly.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttYou know, Annie, this didn't just happen 
ttto you.

tAnnie is applying moisturizer when she hears this. As it 
tsinks in, she doesn't like it.

<b>tINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tGrace stands by her door and can hear her parents muffled, 
ttense voices. Annie is angry at his complacency. Robert just 
twants what's best for Grace. She closes the door. Silence. 
tShe puts her crutches against the wall and tries to walk 
ttowards her bureau without them. It is a struggle, but she 
tdoes... almost falling, but grabbing the bureau just in time. 
tThe 8X10 of her and Pilgrim, falls face down. She props it up 
tand looks at it -- focusing on her horse, then on Judith. 
tSuddenly, she lashes out, knocking the photograph onto the

</b>ttDo you want any help?

tGrace doesn't even bother to answer. She manages to get onto 
tthe pavements, then turns for her bag...

tAnnie notices other kids looking at Grace from behind, as they 
tenter the school.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDad'll pick you up today, all right?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttOkay.

tGrace looks up to her mother. What is unspoken between them 
tis the understanding that today will be difficult and there's 
tnothing either one can do about it.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou'll be fine.

tGrace nods and turns to the school. Annie watches her go.

<b>tINT. GRACE'S SCHOOL - MORNING
</b>
tGrace makes her way through the hall. It is the first time 
tshe has had to maneuver through a crowd. Some of the younger 
tchildren are especially unconscious. Grace sweats her way 
tthrough, trying to maintain her balance and her sanity.

tAs Grace slowly moves along, whatever small faith she had 
tthat she could get through this day, begins to diminish.

<b>tINT. ANNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

</b>ttI don't care what he told you! The 
ttman's a liar! The man's an actor, for

ton top half of the door.

tThere is an immediate explosion of sound inside the stall, 
tthe sound of fear, startling them. Then it's still. Liz 
tslowly opens the door. Grace, with the aide of her cane, 
twalks to the stall. She hesitates, then looks in. It takes a 
tmoment for her eyes to grow accustomed to the dark. She sees

twhat's happened and, together with Robert, rush to her... They 
ttoo see the monster Pilgrim has become and are horrified. 
tGrace angrily pushes away from them and "runs" off. Robert

</b>ttI wouldn't know what to do if you were 
tton time.

tThey walk together towards the fairgrounds.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou're looking fit.

<b>tttt  RONA
</b>ttFit? You want to check my teeth.
ttt(Tom laughs)
ttGood crowd today. I think you'll have 
ttsome fun. You going to stay for dinner?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttIf it's not too much trouble, I thought 
ttI might.

<b>tttt  RONA
</b>ttt(playful)
ttKind of trouble I'm in the mood for.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttOh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the 
tttruck.

tRona lets out a hearty laugh as they enter the horse arena.

<b>tEXT. HORSE ARENA, CALIFORNIA - DAY
</b>
tInside the corral, a small black thoroughbred is being worked 
tby Tom. As he rides and narrates into a radio microphone to 
tthe crowd, we sense this is a man of good humor and great 
tskill --  guileless, sensible, of the earth.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>tt... It's always kind of interesting to 
tthear the horse's side of the story...

tThe crowd laughs warmly. He directs his comments to a WOMAN 
twearing an expensive Ralph Lauren western outfit, standing 
toutside the corral...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttNow if he was cranky or lazy, like you 
ttsay he is, we'd be seeing his tail 
tttwitching there and his ears back, 
ttmaybe. But this isn't a cranky horse, 
ttit's a scared horse. You see how braced 
tthe is up around the neck back there. 
ttHe just doesn't know which way to turn...

tThe Woman nods. Tom turns the horse on a dime so that he 
talways stays facing the circling thoroughbred...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou see how he keeps pointing his 
tthindquarters in at me? Well, I'd guess 
ttthe reason he seems reluctant to move 
ttout is because when he does, he gets in 
tttrouble for it.

<b>tttt  THE WOMAN
</b>ttHe's not good at transitions, you know? 
ttWhen I want him to move from a trot to a 
ttlope, say...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(smiles)
ttWell, I'm sure that's what you think but 
ttthat's not what I'm seeing. You may think 
ttyou're asking for a lope, but your body 
ttmay be saying something else altogether. 
ttYou might be putting too many conditions 
tton him. For instance, you might be saying 
tt"GO, but, hey, don't go too fast." He can 
tttell that from the way you feel. Your 
ttbody can't lie. You ever give him a kick 
ttto make him move out?

<b>tttt  THE WOMAN
</b>ttHe won't go unless I do.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttAnd then he goes and you feel like he's 
ttgoing too fast, so you yank him back?
ttt(she nods)
ttAnd next thing you know, he's bucking.
ttt(she nods again)
ttWell, if someone told you to go, stop, 
ttgo, stop -- you'd buck too.

tThe people laugh. The Woman smiles self-consciously.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttIt's a dance, see... Somebody has to lead 
ttand somebody has to follow.

tTom gracefully moves his horse around the ring, "dancing". He 
tthen takes up a long coiled rope and throws it so that the 
tcoils slap against the black horse's flank, making it burst 
tinto a lope. And again... Making the animal go from a trot to 
ta lope, letting it slow, then up to a lope again.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI want him to get so he can leave real 
ttsoft. He's getting the idea now. He's 
ttnot all braced up and tense like he was 
ttat the start. He's finding out it's okay.

tHe throws the rope again and this time the transition to the 
tlope is a smooth one.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou see that? He's getting better 
ttalready. Pretty soon, if you work at 
ttit, you'll be able to make all these 
tttransitions easy on a loose rein.
ttt(sotto voce, wry)
ttYeah, and pigs'll fly.
ttt(to Woman)
ttHe's going to be okay -- so long as you 
ttdon't go yanking on him.

tShe nods, but he can see she's upset, feeling foolish. He 
twalks the horse over to her, turns off the microphone and 
tspeaks sympathetically:

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttLook, the truth is it's all about self-
ttpreservation. These animals.
ttt(with great affection)
tt... well, they just have such big hearts, 
ttyou know? There's nothing they want more 
ttthan to do what you want them to do. But 
ttwhen the messages get all confused, the 
ttonly thing they know to do is try and 
ttsave themselves... Now, why don't you go 
ttsaddle up and see what happens.

tFeeling better, and not a little attracted to his heartfelt 
tman's man, the Woman smiles and reaches for his hand to climb 
tover the rail. Her horse lets her come right up to him and 
tstroke his neck. Tom comments;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttThey won't ever hold a thing against 
ttyou. They're the most forgiving 
ttcreatures God ever made.

tTurning on his mike and turning back to the crowd, he says:

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttOkay, who's next?

tA Young Boy leads a mule into the ring. Tom smiles:

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttNow God has another idea entirely with 
ttthe mule.

<b>tEXT. THE FAIRGROUNDS - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
tTom has finished his "show." People are shaking his hand, 
tthanking him, as he walks away from the corral, towards a 
ttrailer.

tThe Woman in the Ralph Lauren approaches:

<b>tttt  WOMAN
</b>ttExcuse me.

tHe faces the Woman:

<b>tttt  WOMAN
</b>ttHi. I'm Dale. I just wanted to -- I can't 
ttget over the way he felt under me after 
ttyou'd finish with him. Everything had 
ttjust, I don't know, freed up or something.

tThe Woman is flirting. Tom shrugs, uncomfortably;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWell, that'll happen.

<b>tttt  WOMAN
</b>ttWhere did you learn all this stuff?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWhat stuff is that?

<b>tttt  WOMAN
</b>ttAbout horses? I'd love to learn more 
ttabout it myself. Do you offer any 
ttprivate lessons for riders?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>tt t(getting the message)
ttWell... Dale... you know, a lot of this 
ttstuff... it just... nuts and bolts.

<b>tttt  WOMAN
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWell, if the rider's nuts, the horse 
ttbolts.
ttt(smiles)
ttThat's the whole lesson right there. 
ttYou have a good day now... Just... keep 
tton freeing yourself up.

tHe leaves her, entering the trailer.

<b>tINT. RONA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
</b>
tA small, well-used trailer. Tom and Rona are finishing dinner 
tlike comfortable old friends. Rona rises, taking the plates 
tinto the kitchen and starts rinsing them:

<b>tttt  RONA
</b>ttOh I clear forget. You had a call from 
ttsome woman in New York. She sounded 
ttpretty wound up.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI don't any woman in New York. But from 
ttwhat I hear, most of them are wound up.

<b>tttt  RONA
</b>ttThe number's by the phone.

tHe nods but doesn't move. He just looks at Rona and smiles. 
tShe's a good woman. But Tom hopes she doesn't want anymore 
tthan what they have together. Rona notices him looking and 
tsmiles:

<b>tttt  RONA
</b>ttWhat are you looking at, young man?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHow long were you married?

<b>tttt  RONA
</b>ttLong enough.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou ever miss it?

<b>tttt  RONA
</b>ttDoes a horse miss a saddle?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttSometimes.

tShe chuckles, shuts the water off and crosses back to him, 
tsitting beside him.

<b>tttt  RONA
</b>ttWell as a matter of fact, I don't... most 
ttof the time.

tShe starts unbuttoning his shirt.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou know, Rona, we weren't all that good 
tttogether even when we were good together.

<b>tttt  RONA
</b>ttHoney... I was always good.

tTom smiles as Rona leans in. They kiss.

<b>tINT. ANNIE'S OFFICE, N.Y.C. - MORNING
</b>
tAnnie is looking over a magazine cover with Lucy and her staffers. 
tShe is unhappy.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou know it's perfectly shot, it's 
ttperfectly cropped, it's perfectly laid 
ttout and I'm so bloody bored, I'd rather

tSome general whines and groans as her assistant hands her a 
tnote.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttUh, would you all excuse me a moment?

tShe waits for them to leave as she sits before the phone. One 
tof her lines is lit:

<b>tEXT. A ROADSIDE SERVICE STATION SOMEWHERE IN UTAH - DAY
</b>
tAn endless sky. An empty ribbon of two-lane highway in Utah. 
tA small roadside station. Tom's pick-up truck, his horse

tTom is on the pay phone. We hear Annie's voice:

<b>tttt  ANNIE (O.S.)
</b>ttThis is Annie MacLean.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a 
ttmessage you called.

tINTERCUT ANNIE in her office:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(efficient, expeditiously)
ttOh! Yes. Thank you for calling back. Uh, 
ttall right, let me try to explain my 
ttsituation as briefly as possible... You 
ttsee, my daughter had an accident with 
tther horse... They were both injured and 
ttshe, my daughter, she hasn't been able 
ttto... fully... uh... It was an extremely 
tttraumatic experience... and uh...

tTom, sensing her turmoil, listening compassionately.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI went on the Internet and found this 
ttarticle about you... It says you're a Horse 
ttWhisperer, that you... you help people 
ttwith horse problems. And you have quite a

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWell, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses 
ttwith people's problems.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell, you know, however you want to put 
ttit -- I got your information from the 
ttpublisher of the article. I called 
ttMontana and your sister-in-law, I think, 
ttgave me this number.
ttt(trying to be charming)
ttI'm been hot on your trail you could say 
ttbecause I was hoping you'd consider

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttMa'am, I'm very sorry about your problems 
ttand I appreciate what your daughter must 
ttbe going through, but I'm afraid you've 
ttmisunderstood whatever it is you read. I 
ttdon't do that sort of thing.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell, if you could just come for the day. 
ttNew York's only a few hours by plane, 
ttI'd have you home by dinner...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttLook, even if it was nearer, that's just 
ttnot what I do. I give clinics. And I'm 
ttnot even doing them for a while. I'm

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(interrupts, abruptly)
ttI'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you 
ttto Montana first class.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(getting impatient)
ttMa'am, first class to Montana is a waste 
ttof good money. Now, am I being too polite 
tthere or when I say NO in Utah, does that 
ttmean YES in New York City?

tAnnie is taken aback. Tom feels badly.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I 
ttunderstand your situation. But there's 
ttnothing I can do. You just called the 
ttwrong person, that's all. I hear there 
ttare a bunch of therapists in New York. 
ttMaybe you should call one of them.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttMr. Booker, if I could just ex --

<b>tttt  TOM

tHe hangs up before Annie can continue.

<b>tINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tAnnie reaches for Grace's bedroom door, then pauses. She 
trealizes she should knock. She does and whispers:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttGrace?
ttt(knocks again)
ttGrace, it's mom.

tAnnie slowly opens the door. She finds Grace's bed empty. She 
tlooks over to the window to find Grace sitting in a chair, in 
tthe dark, looking out the window.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttGrace. What are you doing?

tNot looking up, Grace speaks in a hollow voice.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI can't find that charm Daddy gave me 
ttfrom India.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI brought it to you in the hospital.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttNo, you didn't.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttGrace, I put it on the table near your --

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt(apathetic)
ttDoesn't matter.

tBeat.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHave you decided about Pilgrim?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhat about him?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell... how you feel all right about 
tttelling Liz to put him down...

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI think we should. It's not fair to let 
tthim suffer. He's not much use anymore. 
ttHe'd hate living like that.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI think that's... very compassionate 
ttand... mature way of looking at it.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttMom?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYeah?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttMaybe they should put me down too.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why 
ttcan't they be compassionate to me?

tWhat frightens Annie most is the calm and apathy in Grace's 
tvoice. She's surrendering... Annie, for the first time in a 
tlong time, feels she's losing control.

<b>tINT. CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tAnnie sits alone at the kitchen table, nursing a glass of 
twine.

tRobert enters and sits opposite her, wearing a tuxedo -- his 
ttie and collar undone.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHow was the dinner?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttt   (wry)
ttAll our "favorite" people were there 
ttsaying all their "favorite" things about 
tttheir "favorite" subjects. I thought to 
ttmyself, we've been friends with these 
ttpeople almost twenty years and nobody 
ttknows anybody. We're so afraid we won't 
ttlike each other and have nobody go to 
ttdinners with.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhy did you go?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttt(surprised)
ttThey're still our friends, Annie. It's 
ttnothing serious. You kid about them all 
ttthe time... And I could tell Paul really 
ttappreciated me being there.

tHe drinks Annie's wine as she looks at him.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttDid you get a hold of that horse guy?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYeah.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttWhat did he say?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttNo.

tRobert nods. Accepting. Silence. Annie sips her wine. Then:

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI was thinking... Maybe we should think 
ttabout the three of us going someplace 
ttwarm... Remember that house we rented in 
ttBermuda... The pink one with the --

tHis arm accidentally spills the wine.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttShit.

tAs he bends down to wipe it up with a napkin, Annie watches 
tRobert clean the spill. Something about his movements, his 
tposture -- a sense of weakness, of surrendering, of not having 
tthe inclination to fight, of just accepting and smoothing 
tover the rough sports -- strikes her hard. Annie realizes the 
tlove she feels for Robert isn't fading. It's gone.

tHe finishes cleaning and sits.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttWhat was I saying?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttAbout us going someplace warm... 
ttSomeplace Grace'll have to wear shorts 
ttor bathing suits or summer dresses...

tRobert looks at her and realizes it's a bad idea. He nods, 
tagain, getting the message. Silence. In that silence, Annie 
tlooks at him... and makes a decision:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttRobert, I want to take Pilgrim out to Mr. 
ttBooker. Drive him out to Montana... With 
ttGrace.

tRobert is confused... and a little worried.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI don't understand. You just said he 
ttsaid no.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHe did, but... I think I can change his 
ttmind.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttThat's the craziest thing I ever heard. 
ttAbsolutely not.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttRobert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. 
ttAnd she can't sit in this apartment all 
ttday... I think it would be good for her.

<b>ttt  t  ROBERT
</b>ttt(at a loss)
ttNO! What are you -- you're serious about 
ttthis?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI've called Liz. They can set me up with 
tta trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd 
ttstay at motels along the way...

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttt(overlapping)
ttYou've already made arrangements!?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttNo. I was just researching. Calm down.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI come home and you tell me we're going 
ttto drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I 
ttcan't just pick up and leave...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI'm not asking you to. I'll do it.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttYou want to do this by yourself? How? 
ttYou can't take care of Pilgrim all the --

ttI'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.

<b>tttt  ROBERT

ttWhat... Bo-... What about the magazine?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI'm in charge. I went back very soon 
ttafter the accident. They didn't expect me 
ttfor a couple of months. I'll just take 
ttthat time now... I can still oversee 
ttthings from Montana... Take my fax... 
ttMy computer...

tBeat. Robert fears this is about the marriage. Yet --

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttNo. It's, uh... No, I really don't think 
ttit's a good idea

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhy?!

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttt(searching)
ttHer psychiatrist... said... she needs 
ttsecurity now... stability...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI can't say he's been all that effective 
ttwith her.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttAre you a psychiatrist? He said it takes 
tttime.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI don't care what he says! We have to do 
ttsomething, Robert! I can't sit here and 
tttrust everything's going to work out just 
ttby pretending it will.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI'm not pretending anything!

tBeat. Robert just stares at her. He looks concerned... almost 
tworried. Annie gets uncomfortable.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat?

tIt is very difficult for Robert to say;

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI thought... well, ever since the 
ttaccident, I just thought we...

tHe stops. Annie knows where he headed and prays to God he 
tdoesn't continue. He doesn't. A thick silence hangs between 
tthem.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI really wish I could understand why 
ttyou think this is so necessary.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(frustrated)
ttRobert, we're losing her. We're losing 
tther.
ttt(he listens)
ttI don't care what the doctors say. The 
tttruth is, they don't know anymore than 
ttwe do -- less, when it comes to Grace... 
ttThis may not sound sensible or... logical, 
ttbut nobody's suggesting anything better. 
ttI can't explain it, Robert. I just have 
ttthis feeling... this annoying... bloody 
ttfeeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim 
ttcan be made all right... then so can Grace. 
ttI just know it!

tRobert can feel the strength of her will. He can find no way 
taround it.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttWhat if she doesn't want to go?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttShe will if you think she should.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttAnd you think it's best if I don't come.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(hesitates)
ttNo, that's not what I said. I'm not a 
ttdictator. If you feel you should come, 
ttthen come. Just do whatever you think 
ttis right.

tAt some moment, they realize Grace is standing at the entrance 
tto the kitchen. They are surprised.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI'm not going! I don't care what she 
ttsays!

tAnnie lowers her head. Robert stares at Grace as she walks to 
thim.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttDaddy?... I don't want to go.

tGrace stands next to Robert. He holds her hands. Annie looks 
tat him, without sympathy. Robert looks back. In his face is 
tthe total acceptance of what must be. As well as the sadness 
tof it's inevitability. He looks back at his daughter, whose 
teyes have never left him.

<b>tEXT. JOAN DYER STABLE - DAY

tPilgrim is being loaded into the trailer by four strong stable 
tmen, violently kicking and pulling all the way.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttMaybe we should give him another 
ttsedative.

<b>tttt  LIZ
</b>ttProblem is, there aren't many

tIn the back seat of ANNIE'S SUBURBAN sits Grace -- her back to 
tthe action. Hearing Pilgrim's struggle. Putting her walkman 
ton her ears and raising the volume... We hear --

tGRACE'S MUSIC, ON THE SOUNDTRACK, bringing us to:

tGrace, in the back seat, wearing her headphones, listening to 
ther music (maybe LIZ PHAIR OR HOLLY COLE). Detached. Non-
tcommittal. As trucks pass by, their time slapping the pavement, 
tshe reacts and turns to the other window.

tAnnie, in sunglasses, shifts her attention between the road

tA small furnished motel room with two twin beds.

tGrace sits up in bed watching TV, with no expression. A sitcom 
twith canned laughter serves as a hypnotic drug.

tAnnie enters from the bathroom, after showering, drying her 
thair. Grace doesn't bother to look up.

<b>tttt  ANNIE

ttt(Grace shakes her head)
ttWe have to get up early tomorrow. You

tAnnie realizes she may have pushed too hard, but she also 
trealizes there's no talking to Grace now. So, she achieves

tGrace hobbles off the bed, enters the bathroom and shuts the

tGrace, asleep in the other bed, begins whimpering. She's 
thaving a bad dream. Annie rises -- considering whether or not 
tto intercede... Finally, Grace begins to cry out... softly at 
tfirst, but with increasing intensity until she awakens in 
tfear... Annie appears right by her side.

ttthey have a fax. If not, I'll call 
ttyou tomorrow to --

tAnnie continues O.S. when we hear a shifting, a rocking in 
tthe trailer behind them. As if Pilgrim made a sudden move. 
tGrace quickly turns her head. Annie looks in the rear view at 
tGrace.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttUh Lucy, look, I have to go. OK... 
ttLater.

tAnnie hangs up and smiles at Grace through the mirror. Grace 
treaches for her walkman and headphones. Annie offers;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttGrace! GRACE!

tGrace lowers one side of her headphones;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWould you like to put your music on 
ttup here?

tGrace shrugs. Annie shrugs it off as well. Grace replaces the 
theadphone. Annie turns on the radio -- nothing but country or 
tgospel or religious talk shows... She shuts it off. Frustrated, 
tAnnie looks up ahead and sees:

<b>tA TRUCK STOP DINER
</b>
tAnnie yells to be heard through the headphones;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b><b>ttIT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU

</b>
<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt   t (shrugs)
ttWhatever you want.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttFine!

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttFine.

tAnnoyed, Annie pulls onto the gravel and stops, talking to 
therself --

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttFine!

tShe exits the car, banging the door. As she walks acrund the 
tcar to help Grace, she talks to herself in a sarcastic whisper:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>tt"Whatever you want!" Well, this is what 
ttI want. I want to eat lunch and I want 
ttto smoke a cigarette and I want to keep 
tttalking to myself for the next two 
ttthousand fucking miles..."!

tShe opens Grace's door. Grace senses her mother's anger.

<b>tINT. TRUCK STOP DINER - DAY
</b>
tAnnie and Grace enter. They look around:

tFormica floors, truckers in caps and beer bellies stuffed 
tinto booths or at the counter. There is not a single space 
tavailable.

tAnnie and Grace stand near the entrance. Another Trucker 
tenters and they step aside, huddled together in this foreign 
tland.

<b>tINT. MOTEL IN IOWA - NIGHT
</b>
tGrace and Annie enter the room to find A DOUBLE BED instead 
tof two twins. Neither comments.

tAnnie exits O.S., carrying the bags inside, as she says:

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou should call your dad before it 
ttgets too late.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI already did.

ttThis morning. When you went running.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh. You didn't tell me.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI didn't know I had to.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(stares angrily, speaks 
ttt softly)
ttYou don't.

tSilence. Annie exits past her to the car.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tLATER
</b>
tGrace is asleep in her twin bed. Once again, Annie is wide 
tawake. The clock reads: 4:55 AM. But Annie can not sleep. 
tCamera moves away from Annie, past her side of the bed, to 
tthe other side of the room.

tWE SEE THE SHADOW OF A WOMAN coming towards the bed. She 
tcomes in camera angle and we follow to her back to the bed, 
twhich has now transformed into --

<b>tA BED FROM THE PAST, IN WHICH A TEN-YEAR-OLD ANNIE IS 
</b><b>tSLEEPING WITH HER YOUNGER BROTHER GEORGE.
</b>
<b>tWE ARE IN MEMORY.
</b>
tThe Woman gently shakes little Annie awaken.

<b>tttt  WOMAN
</b>ttAnnie... Annie, sweetheart... wake

tThe little girl, with sleep in her eyes, turns and sees her.

<b>tttt  WOMAN
</b>ttBad news I'm afraid. Your Daddy's 
ttgone.

<b>tEND OF MEMORY.
</b>
tAnnie, in present time next to Grace, thinks of this as she 
tstays awake. Putting her jogging parka on over her nightgown, 
tshe goes outside.

<b>tEXT. IOWA MOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
tShe crosses the motel parking lot to the horse trailer. She 
tlooks in through the siding at Pilgrim, checking on him. She 
tsees he is caught his halter on the side of the van. She 
tcrosses to the trailer door, hesitates, then opens it. 
tPilgrim looks at her. Gathering her courage, she climbs 
tinside. He is still, looking at her. She carefully frees his 
thalter. And suddenly he bares his teeth, biting at her. She 
tstumbles back out of the trailer, slamming the door shut. She 
tstands leaning against the trailer -- wondering if she's out 
tof her mind for attempting this.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. IOWA MOTEL - LATER THAT SAME MORNING
</b>
tAnnie is returning from her jog, sweating. As she crosses to 
ther motel room, she stops by the window, looking in to see:

tGrace, on the floor, straining to do her exercises.

tAnnie fills with compassion for her girl -- reminded of the 
tstruggle she faces everyday.

<b>tEXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY
</b>
tIn the distance, the Suburban and horse trailer look like a 
tdot on the horizon, moving across the Badlands.

<b>tINT. THE SUBURBAN - ANOTHER TIME, DUSK
</b>
tGrace leans against the window in the back, in one of her 
tdarker moods. Annie switches radio stations, from Bible 
tthumping to Farm reports. She shuts it off. Silence.

tShe sees a ROAD SIGH: "LITTLE BIGHORN NATIONAL MONUMENT".

<b>tttt ANNIE
</b>ttGrace, look!

tGrace reads the sign.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWould you like to see that?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI don't care.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(overlapping)
ttI don't care.

tAnnie's comic mimicking, throws Grace off center.

tAnnie turns off onto the exit. They drive by a massive casino 
t-- it's neon sign flickering. They drive up a hill past a cafe, 
ttwo Indians in high crowned Cowboy hats standing outside of 
tthe cafe. She drives up a hill towards the parking lot of the 
tMonument...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThis'll be nice. We haven't seen any 
ttof the sights yet. It's history. When 
ttI was thirteen I used to love seeing 
ttthings like this.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttYou were never thirteen, Mom.

tAnnie laughs, taking it as a joke. Grace almost smiles.

tBut, Annie drives up to sign only to find a CLOSED SIGN. The 
tpark was closed at six. Annie stops the car. She's hit a 
tbrick wall once more. Silence. Finally, Grace speaks with her 
tusual sarcasm;

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttGreat idea. So now what?

tBeat. Annie's patience snaps;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHow long is this going to go on?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou know what I mean?
ttt(turns to the back seat)
ttIs this it now? Is this the way we're 
ttgoing to be from now on?

tIgnoring her, Grace edges to the passenger side and exits the 
tcar. Annie gets out of the driver's side and walks around as 
tshe speaks:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDo you want us to turn around and go 
ttback home? Do you?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhat are you asking me for? You didn't 
ttask me if I wanted to come in the first 
ttplace -- now I get to decide? Forget it!

tShe begins to turn away. Annie grabs her arm.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWho do you think I'm doing this for? 
ttI'm doing this for you!

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttBullshit! It's about you! About you

ttright! You always getting everything 
ttyour way, controlling everybody -- 
ttlike we work for you or something!

</b>ttYou just want to get away from Daddy 
ttand you're using me to do it!

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThat's not true! Whatever problems your

ttto do with this.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttYou're amazing! You act like I don't 
ttlive in that house! Don't you think I 
tthear the two of you!? Don't you think 
ttI can tell what's going on? I'm not 
ttfive years old, Mom!
ttt(Annie is stopped)
ttYou want to divorce Daddy and Daddy 
ttdoesn't want to.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDid he tell you that?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttHe doesn't have to! It's, like, so 
ttobvious you can't stand him.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThat's not true!

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttThen why do you want to leave?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIt's... it's not that simple to explain. 
ttI know you think it is, but it's not. 
ttThe truth is, I don't really know what 
ttI want to do. I don't have all the 
ttanswers.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttNo, you just act like you do.

tAnnie is choked with fury. She doesn't know whether to 
tscream, cry or strangle Grace. She turns away and begins 
twalking quickly, blindly, up past a grove of trees. She comes 
tto a CEMETERY enclosed by a black railing. At the crest of 
tthe hill there's a stone monument "The Little Bighorn 
tCemetery."

tIn the growing darkness, she sees, scattered on the hillsides 
tbelow her, white tombstones. A place of sorrow. A cool breeze 
truffles her coat and she sticks her hands in her pockets. 
tFrustrated, alone, at a complete loss as to what to do, what 
taction to take -- Annie, for the first time in frozen, 
tstanding still -- and with her, comes a rush of emotion.

tShe sits with her back against the monument and begins to 
tweep. For Grace, for Robert, herself, for the tombstones, for 
teveryone.

tA FLASHLIGHT shines on her face. It is a PARK RANGER.

<b>tttt  PARK RANGER
</b>ttYou okay, ma'am?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(wipes face)
ttYes. Fine.

<b>tttt  PARK RANGER
</b>ttThat young lady is getting a little 
ttworried.

tAnnie realizes she left Grace alone as it got darker.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI'm sorry. I'm sorry...

tAnnie rises and is escorted back to the Suburban by the 
tRanger. She sees:

tGrace is sitting in the front seat now, waiting for her -- 
tlike a little girl lost.

<b>tINT. SUBURBAN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tAnnie gets into the driver's seat. Buckles up. Grace holds 
tback tears.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou buckled up?
ttt(Grace nods)
ttYou cold?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttLittle.

tAnnie reaches into the back seat and pulls a blanket out, 
thanding it to Grace, making sure it covers her. Grace turns 
ttowards the window and closes her eyes. Annie starts the car.

<b>tEXT. MONTANA, BACK ROAD - MORNING

tC.U. on Pilgrim's head in the trailer as we PULL BACK to 
treveal the Suburban coming down an empty, seemingly infinite 
tstretch of two-lane road in Montana.

<b>tINT. SUBURBAN - MORNING
</b>
tAnnie and Grace, both in front seats, eating doughnuts and 
tcoffee. They stop.

tPOV -- Through the windshield is an endless sky and a rolling 
tsea of land.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttGee, this looks like a fun place.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDon't they believe in signs here?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhat would they say? "Ten miles to big

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThere was supposed to be a turn off. 
ttDid I miss it?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI didn't see it.

tTheir Suburban is the only vehicle on what seems like miles 
tof road. Annie sighs and puts the Suburban in drive.

<b>tEXT. PETERSON'S MOTEL & STABLES, RED FORK MONTANA - DAY

tThe Suburban and the horse trailer, pulls into Peterson's -- a 
tcollection of motel cottage adjacent to an expanse of land 
tthat includes stable, corral, a main house and various riding 
ttrails into the mountains.

tMr. Peterson runs out from the main house to greet Annie as 
tshe gets out of the car.

<b>tINT. SUBURBAN, ON ANOTHER MONTANA BACK ROAD - LATER THAT DAY

tAnnie, showered and changed, is trying to follow Mr.

tmotel stationary. She is lost once again.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(reading)
tt... after left, stay on main road until

ttt(frustrated)
ttWhat bloody rise?!? What main road!?

tShe stops the Suburban (no longer carrying the trailer).

<b>tEXT. ANOTHER MONTANA BACK ROAD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tFrom outside the Suburban, we see, but cannot hear, Annie 
thitting the steering and cursing in frustration.

<b>tINT. SUBURBAN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tAnnie, panting, looks ahead and sees nothing but empty space, 
tabove and below -- as if the earth and sky met with nothing in 
tbetween.

tShe sighs and starts the car again. As she moves forward, she 
tsenses an almost indistinguishable rise in the road -- as we 
tfollow her POV up the road through the windshield to reveal:

tPOV -- A BREATHTAKING VALLEY just beyond the rise, hidden 
tfrom view only a few yards before. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH 
tsits nestled in the valley, a few miles away. Annie is 
timpressed.

<b>tEXT. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE RANGE - DAY
</b>
tMen are working in the corral, saddle horses standing nearby, 
ttrying to get a sick calf to suckle a cow. One of the men is 
tTom Booker, working along side his brother FRANK, and his 
tnephew, JOE. Frank is a good man -- solid work ethic, 
tChristian fearing, wry sense of humor. With the build of a 
tfootball player, his strength never overwhelms his boyish, 
tgood-natured heart. Joe is eleven, wearing his cowboy hat 
tlike a badge of honor. The three men seem as inseparable to 
teach other, as they are to the land. As they work:

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttCan we take a look at Bronty's foal 
ttwhen we're done here, Dad?

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttSure. As long as she don't mind.

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttThere's a kid at school says we 
ttshould've imprint-trained him.

tTom and Frank don't say anything. Just nod, knowingly.

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttHe says if you do it soon as they're 
ttborn, it makes them real easy to handle 
ttlater on.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttThat's what some folks say.

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttThere was this thing on the TV about a 
ttguy who does it with geese. He has this 
ttairplane and these baby geese all grow 
ttup thinking it's their mom, and he flies 
ttit and they just follow.
ttt(to Tom)
ttYou hear 'bout that, Uncle T?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYeah, I hear about that.

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttWell, what do you think about that 
ttstuff?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWell, Joe, I'll tell ya -- I don't know 
tta whole lot about geese. Maybe it's okay 
ttfor them to grow up thinking they're 
ttairplanes. But horses, as far as I can 
tttell, can't fly.

tFrank laughs. Joe smirks as Tom messes his hat up. There's the 
tsound of a car. They turn.

tThe Suburban is coming over the ridge, heading down the 
tdriveway in a cloud of dust.

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttWe expecting company?

tFrank shakes his head. As the Suburban slows down, Tom 
trecognizes the driver.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI don't believe it.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttYou know her?

tAnnie, out of her element, hiding behind sunglasses, gets out 
tas Tom approaches her by himself. Annie girds herself for the 
tconfrontation.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHello, Mr. Booker. Annie MacLean. From 
ttNew York. We talked on the phone.

tShe extends her hand. TOM shakes it, nodding, staring at her 
tcuriously.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIt's, uh... beautiful country. I had a 
ttlittle bit of a hard time finding the 
ttplace. There are no signs.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttPlenty of signs -- just none of them 
ttprinted. Who do I get the idea you're 
ttnot just passing through!

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd 
ttlike you to take a look at my horse. 
ttNow -- it won't take long and if, after 
ttthat, you still don't feel...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWere you thinking of personally driving 
ttme back East?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh no. She's here. I brought him along. 
ttAnd my daughter, too. We're staying at 
ttPeterson's...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou mean you hauled him all the way out 
tthere? Just like that?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(slightly taken aback)
ttWell... yes... I had a trailer. It's not 
ttlike I made him run along side of the car.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttAll by yourself?

tShe nods. Tom cannot help be impressed by her guts and fortitude.

tCamera cuts away for a moment to a window in the ranch house, 
tthrough which DIANE -- Frank's fiery, loyal pioneer wife -- 
tlooks at the duo with suspicion.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever 
ttmet a lady quite like yourself and I 
ttappreciate all the pains you've gone 
ttthrough to --

</b>ttLook! Please! Don't do the "shucks,

ttt(Tom, surprised, listens)
ttI've driven a few thousand miles for a 
ttfew minutes of your time. I've brought 
tthim here -- to your neck of the...

tt-- mountains. Just take a look at him. 
ttIf you still feel the same way, I'll 
ttbe on the road by morning and you'll 
ttnever see me again. OK? Deal?

tTom tries to hide a smile of respect. Annie, thinking she may 
thave him, starts backing away towards her car -- as one would 
ta dangerous animal they think they might have tamed...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWe're at Peterson's. Whenever you're 
ttfree. You don't even have to call.

tShe gets into the Suburban. Tom watches her drive off.

<b>tEXT. ANNIE AND GRACE'S COTTAGE - DAY
</b>
tTom walks up some wooden steps to a door and knocks. He hears 
ta TV on inside. And Grace's Voice:

<b>tttt  GRACE (O.S.)
</b>ttMOM! The door!

tHe hears Annie's muffled reply from O.S. He hears some banging 
tas Grace fumbles for her crutch and comes to the door. She 
topens it only so far as to reveal her upper body:

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttYeah?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttUh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother 
ttaround?

tGrace hops to the side as Tom walks by her, into the room. 
tGrace is closing the door as he turns to see, for the first 
ttime, that Grace is one leg.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttShe'll be right out. She's on the 
ttphone.

tGrace hops back to the bed in front of the TV. Tom nods and 
tputs his hat down -- noticing the prosthetic leaning against 
tthe window, near her bed. He hears Annie on the phone and 
tlooks to the other room, the door ajar -- seeing only her 
tlegs, seated on the edge of her bed, as she talks. Her foot 
ttaps impatiently.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttFirst time in Montana?

tGrace, rudely nods, still looking at the TV.

tBeat. Tom doesn't like her manner, but can easily see through 
tit. He sits.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttShe gonna be long?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttProbably. She's on the phone twenty-
ttthree hours a day.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWhat does she do?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttShe's an editor.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttMmm. An editor.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttNot like books or literature or anything. 
ttJust a magazine... Just in case she 
tthasn't told you -- which I'm sure she 
tthasn't -- I don't want to be a part of 
ttthis, OK?

tTom just sort of nods. A beat or two later, Annie enters.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttSorry about that. Hi. Grace, this is 
ttMr. Booker... Have you looked at 
ttPilgrim?

tTom sees Grace turn away, just as Annie enters. He takes a 
tmoment. He could say no right there, but something stops him.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttUh, no. I was gonna take a look now.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou want us to come with you? I just 
tthave to run to the main house and give 
ttMr. Peterson a check.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttDoesn't matter.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttGrace?... Grace, you want to come with 
ttus, take a look at Pilgrim?

tGrace keeps looking at the TV. No reply. Tom is half way out 
tthe door when he says to Annie -- making sure Grace can hear --

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttProbably best she stays behind, anyway.

tHe disappears. Annie gives Grace a final look and exits, closing the door.

tAlone, Grace flings her body across the bed, reaching for her 
tprosthetic -- putting it on feverishly. She is completely 
tintrigued by Tom.

<b>tEXT. PETERSON'S STABLES - DAY
</b>
tTom stands alone at the stable. Opening the bottom door, 
tducking under the stall, he goes inside.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttOkay now... Okay now...

tWalking towards him, Tom raises his hand, showing Pilgrim a 
tsign of respect, of trust... He quietly makes his way along 
tPilgrim's side, along his flank, prompting Pilgrim to move 
tout from the shadows, into the light. Tom moves to look at 
thim. And Pilgrim suddenly kicks out at him. Tom, not cowed, 
tstands his ground. He bends, looking at Pilgrim's withered 
tlegs. He looks up at his scarred head. He looks into the 
tpools of the horse's tortured eyes. Pilgrim stands still -- 
tallowing Tom this brief intimacy.

tAs Grace walks towards the stable, she realizes that the door 
tis open and Tom must be inside. She is amazed.

tAnnie, appearing behind her, is also impressed.

tTom exits the stable and sees them, as he closes the doors.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell... You're closest anyone's 
ttgotten.

tHe walks straight towards them -- veering more to Grace. He 
tstops in front of her and they look into each other's eyes -- 
tin a way that reminds us of how Tom looked at Pilgrim.

tExcept, Grace is made even more uncomfortable by the intimacy. 
tShe turns away and walks to the corral, to lean on a post -- 
tas if she doesn't care. Tom turns to Annie.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI have to be honest. I still feel 
ttyou made a long trip for nothing.

tHe looks at Annie. Annie has no more words -- just an ever-
tpresent pleading in her face.

tTom watches as Grace makes a small, naked movement -- putting 
ther hand on her cheek, like a hurt child.

tHe can't help but see these three being connected by one wound.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttBut before I even think about it, I 
ttneed to know something here and now. 
ttIt's a question for Grace here.

tGrace stiffens.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWhen I work with a horse, it's no good 
ttjust me doing it. It doesn't work that 
ttway. The owner needs to be involved too.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell, that'll be a little complicated --

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou can make it as complicated or as 
tteasy as you like. But she's the one 
ttwho's gonna be riding him, am I right? 
ttSo here's the deal. I'm not sure I can 
ttdo anything, but I'm prepared to give 
ttit a go --
ttt(to Grace)
tt-- if you'll help.
ttt(Grace gives a bitter laugh)
ttYou have a problem with that?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttIsn't it like, obvious?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttNot to me. Either you want to or you 
ttdon't.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttLook, I'll talk to Grace and call you 
ttlater--

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttExcuse me, with all due respect, but 
ttthis is her decision, not yours. And I 
ttdon't want to waste anybody's time -- 
ttmostly mine.

tGrace reacts anew to Tom's remark. She likes her mother being 
tdis-empowered. Annie keenly understands the importance of Tom 
tputting it this way to Grace. Grace has all eyes on her -- 
tjust what she wants. All waiting for her response. She turns 
taway, flicks her head and says:

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWell, there's nothing else to do around 
tthere.

tAnnie smiles in relief. But Tom isn't satisfied.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttNot good enough. I can't help you.

tHe starts walking away. Annie doesn't know what to do. Grace 
tmumbles.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhat do I have to do?

tTom keeps walking out... Grace says it louder.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI said, what do I have to do?!

tTom stops and looks at her. Annie holds her breath.

ttI believe women from New York eat mixed

</b>ttI believe so. Saw it on a television

ttWe're not sure, sweetheart, but they

<b>tINT. ANNIE AND GRACE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tCamera moves to reveal Annie on the phone in front of her 
tcomputer and fax...  plugging in extension cords as she talks:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>tt... the phone company's putting in extra 
ttlines. I'll call back with the numbers. 
ttOh, and I want you to get in touch with 
ttthis lady in town here -- they say she's 
ttsort of a physical therapist for the 
ttrodeo boys but keep the one at the 
tthospital we already contacted on call...

tGrace sits alone in the living room. Watching TV, but anxious 
tand disturbed about what she's committed herself to.

<b>tINT. DOUBLE DIVIDE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</b>
tDiane is in her bathrobe doing bills at the kitchen table, as 
tshe listens to a BOOK OF TAPE. Her hand on her forehead, her 
tother hand writing. Tom enters to take his hat off the 
tsideboard. He moves to the table and reaches over for a 
tcookie from a plate of cookies. Without looking up, Diane 
tslaps his hand. Tom then pours himself a cup of coffee... then 
tswiftly sneaks his hand back and grabs a cookie. Diane smiles. 
tTom exits.

tIt is only then that Diane looks up after him.

<b>tINT. UPPER FLOOR OF RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tCamera follows Tom towards his bedroom --  passing the others. 
tPerhaps we see Frank sprawled out asleep already in his 
tunderwear. We might see the Twins in their bunks. One of the 
tTwins' lower torso is laying outside of the blanket. He 
tcasually flips the blanket over the kid's bare feet and 
tcontinues to his room.

<b>tINT. TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tTom enters and closes the door. Turns on a stereo which plays 
ta cello piece by Yo-Yo Ma. Books fills his room. He sits at 
this desk, puts on eye glasses and looks through some paperwork. 
tSuddenly he stops, looking over the paperwork, into space. A 
tthought passes by. We don't know what.

<b>tttttttFADE OUT:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE RANCH, A CORRAL - DAYBREAK
</b>
tFirst light of day. Pilgrim stands stock still in the middle 
tof the corral. Tom, motionless, is crouched on his haunches 
tin the corral -- watching him.

tTOM'S POV: As Pilgrim moves, he can see that the horse is 
tstove up.

tHe softly tosses a handful of dirt at Pilgrim's withered 
tlegs... Pilgrim, sensitive to the slightest provocation, 
tbucks, wheeling away from him. Then stops. Tom sits on his 
thaunches again... and watches him.

tFrank appears, exiting from the barn (perhaps).

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttTom?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYeah.

tTom leaves Pilgrim, hooking up with Frank -- the two brothers 
tgo off, discussing the ranch work that is ahead of them.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE RANCH - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
tAnnie and Grace arrive in the Suburban. They exit. As they 
thead towards the ranch, they see in the distance:

tPilgrim standing along the fence of a round pen. Tom stands 
tin the pen, holding a rope, looking at Pilgrim.

<b>tEXT. THE ROUND PEN - DAY
</b>
tTom stands in the pen with Pilgrim. He looks to see Annie and 
tGrace approaching but makes no acknowledgement. He turns his 
tfocus back to Pilgrim.

tAnnie and Grace appear. Grace takes a position (that is to 
tbecome her regular spot) a distance away from the pen. Annie 
tmoves in closer, beside SMOKEY (a ranch hand) with one leg 
tup on the pen fence.

<b>tttt  SMOKEY
</b>ttHowdy...
ttt(sees Grace)
ttHowdy.

tHe and Annie watch as Tom stands before Pilgrim -- turning 
tsideways... then standing...

<b>tttt   ANNIE
</b>ttWhat's he doing?

<b>tttt   SMOKEY
</b>ttTrying to get his eye.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHow's it going?

tSmokey doesn't respond -- how it's going is exactly how it 
tlooks. Tom takes a few steps, stops and stands still again. We 
tsense the process is long and requires great patience.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. ROUND PEN - DAY
</b>
tTwo hours later. Grace is in the same spot. Smokey is gone, 
tdoing his work. Annie has taken a different position, looking 
tover SEVERAL PAGES OF FAXES on her lap.

tTom is still standing in the pen trying to get Pilgrim's eyes.

tJoe has joined the proceedings, sitting on the pen rail.

tTom deftly throws a hoolihan, gently lassoing Pilgrim around 
tthe neck. And Pilgrim, at the touch of the rope, crazed, 
tresists, pulling back, striking at the rope... The rope 
tcutting into Tom's hands. Tom gives him some slack, giving 
this head, letting him relax... then gently heads him by the 
trope, walking him around the pen, getting his feet to moving.

tGrace's eyes never leave Tom.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY
</b>
tTom, off in the distance -- against a sky that seems to be 
ttouching the land -- is riding along a creek. Closer up, we 
tsee he's rustling the bushes with a stick. Some stray cows 
trun out of the bushes. Tom races after them. His horse 
tshepherds the cow across the creek and up a hillside.

tAt the top of the hill, with the ranch spread out endlessly 
tbefore him, Tom sees Frank on his horse, chasing strays. Tom 
twhistles. Frank waves back. In the near distance, a pickup 
ttruck is parked on the range.

tJoe and the TWINS are throwing food pellets out of the back 
tof the truck. Cattle come from across the range for the food. 
tWhat begins as a handful of cows becomes dozens, then 
thundreds -- the truck virtually disappearing among them.

tTom stops for a moment to look out at his ranch. Far off in 
tthe distance, he sees Annie's Suburban coming along the road 
tto the ranch. He watches as Annie's distant figure gets out 
tof the car with Grace. Annie instinctively turns and looks 
tacross the land. Even though there is such a distance, 
tthere's a sense Tom and Annie are looking at each other.

tTom senses Joe driving Frank's truck, slowly moving off the 
trange -- the Twins in the back, the cattle following. Tom sits 
ton his horse atop the hill.

<b>tEXT. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
tPilgrim, his scarred head above water, legs moving in odd 
tsycopation, swimming. We discover he is in a pond, tethered 
tto a pole... Except for the sound of his legs in the water, 
teverything is quiet and focused on Pilgrim.

tSMOKEY, holds the pole, walking on the outside of the pond, 
tleading Pilgrim back and forth as he swims. Tom, crouched by 
tthe pond, silently concentrating on Pilgrim...

tGrace watches, off by herself... Annie stands beside Joe. She 
tcan't help but be intrigued by the sight. She asks Joe;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI though horses were afraid of 
ttwater?

tJoe doesn't answer her. Grace likes that. Annie, frustrated, 
tfeels she has the right to simple shout out to Tom.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIs that to get his strength back?

tTom pays her no mind -- concentrating on Pilgrim.

tSuddenly, Annie's CELL PHONE rings, jarring the proceedings. 
tTom turns to Annie. She hides her embarrassment by answering 
tit, walking away. Tom gives her a look. Grace is loving this. 
tTom turns back to Pilgrim. After a few moments --

tTom, taking the rope tether, unhooks it from the pole. He 
tstarts to lead Pilgrim out of the water. Pilgrim, fearful, 
tfights him. He rears, splashing Tom, not wanting to come out 
tof the water. Grace is worried. She looks to Joe and sees he 
tis concerned too, though he stands quietly.

tAnnie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes 
ther call to return to the pond.

tTom enters the pond, waist deep in water, trying to grab 
tPilgrim's rope. Pilgrim rises up, rearing at him. Joe and 
tSmokey, sensing danger, come closer to the pond. Annie 
tappears beside Grace and watches as Tom reaches for the rope 
tagain. Pilgrim rears again. Tom stumbles backwards from his 
thooves. Annie gasps. Grace turns to walk away from the pond. 
tShe can't watch -- it brings back too much. But as she does, 
tshe is stopped by the sight of --

tTom, righting himself, unphased, calmly walks back to Pilgrim. 
tThe horse, baffled by this man's lack of fear, lets him take 
tthe rope and walk him out of the pond.

tGrace can't help but be impressed. Joe nods. Annie is shaken.

<b>ttttANNIE
</b>ttMr. Booker, I'm not at all comfortable 
ttwith you taking those kinds of chances...

tAs Tom leads Pilgrim out, the horse suddenly whirls, bolting, 
tknocking Tom down...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh, God!

tPilgrim runs off, pulling the wet rope behind him. Joe runs 
tover and grabs for the rope.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b><b>ttNO... LET HIM GO!
</b>
tJoe obeys. Pilgrim runs past the corral and down into a hill 
tout onto a pasture, He keeps on running into the distance --
trunning across the pasture, not knowing where he is going...

tTom, arms folded across his chest, watches him run. A 
tconcerned Annie approaches.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttShe's running away! How are you going 
ttto get him back?

tTom doesn't respond. He walks off down the hill out onto the 
tpasture, stops, arms folded and watches Pilgrim. Annie turns 
twhen she hears Smokey, who appears behind her:

<b>tttt  SMOKEY
</b>ttHe don't really want to run. Don't 
ttknow where he's going. All this open 
ttspace scares the daylight out of him.

tConfused, Pilgrim stops running and walks, in no particular 
tdirection.

<b>tttt  SMOKEY
</b>ttMy guess is he's spent his life in a 
ttsix-by-eight stall... He's forgot what 
ttit's like to be a horse...

tSmokey ambles off and she turns back to see Tom crouching on 
this haunches, sitting in the grass, just waiting. Pilgrim 
twalks back towards the ranch, stops a distance from Tom, 
tlooks at him... Annie, needing to know exactly what's going 
ton, crosses down the hill to him.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttSo what now? Should we leave?

tTom continues watching Pilgrim. Annie looks at him, sitting 
tthere motionless and feels like an idiot. Clearly she doesn't 
tunderstand all this and clearly no one thinks this is the 
ttime to explain to her.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell, we're going to go then...

tWithout looking at her, Tom just nods. Annie, awkwardly, 
twalks back up the hill to where Grace is...

tON THE GRASSY HILLSIDE, Grace is watching the scene by herself 
tas Joe appears, staring at her leg... It makes her uncomfortable. 
tShe turns to him with a curt, impatient tone;

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhat?

tTheir eyes meet. Joe is so guileless, Grace is taken off guard 
twhen he asks in such a compassionate voice;

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttDoes that hurt you?

tGrace tries to think of an answer -- and of how to say it:

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttOnly when I kick somebody.

tHer gentle delivery makes him smile. She smiles, then:

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttDon't you go to school?

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttTwice a month they give you a day off 
ttto work on the ranch.

tHe tips his hat down as he looks out to Pilgrim with respect;

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttLook at him out in the pasture -- Yeah, 
tthe must've been a big, beautiful looking 
tthorse. How was he to ride?

tGrace is uncomfortable again. She looks away, just struggling. 
tJoe senses she's done talking;

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttExcuse me. I got chores to look after.

tHe tips his hat and walks off, passing Annie as she arrives.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou ready to go?

tGrace hesitates. Then mother and daughter take one more look --

tPOV -- Pilgrim standing in the pasture with Tom crouching in 
tthe grass waiting for him.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. PASTURE - LATER THAT DAY

tTom is still sitting in the grass, just where we left him -- 
twaiting patiently. Pilgrim is still out in the pasture.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. PASTURE - STILL LATER THAT DAY
</b>
tAfternoon shadows cross the ranch. Tom is in the exact same 
tspot and position. Pilgrim is somewhat closer -- but still at 
ta distance -- watching him.

tFrank rides back from work. As he passes Tom, the two nod as 
tif nothing usually is going on. Frank rides up to the barn.

<b>tINT. PETERSON'S MOTEL -
</b>
tGrace is flicking the television -- repeating the only three 
tchannels over and over...

tAnnie works at her computer, surrounded by work. She notices 
tthe time, gets a thought and dials the phone...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHello, Mr. Booker... Oh, hello, Frank.

ttwondering, has-...
ttt(listens)
ttUh-huh... And Pilgrim?...
ttt(listens)
ttStill?... Uh-huh...
ttt(politely cheery)
ttOkay then. Thank you.

tShe hangs up, pauses, then speaks to the window out loud enough 
tfor Grace to hear --

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHe's still sitting in that damn 
ttfield.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt(w/o looking at her)
ttI think they call it a pasture.

tAnnie looks at her as if to say the last thing I need to know is 
ta lesson on the local lingo...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttLet's go see what's going on, then 
ttget something to eat.

<b>tEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH - DUSK
</b>
tThe sky is changing colors, the temperature has dropped. Tom 
tis still sitting in the grass, although someone has brought 
thim a blanket for his shoulders. Pilgrim is in the pasture, 
tbut now -- he too is motionless, looking back at Tom.

tThe sound of a car makes Tom turn to see Annie driving up. 
tShe gets out, stands by the car with a proprietary air, 
twatching Tom and Pilgrim. Grace remains in the car. There's a 
tsound. She turns to see Diane coming out of the house...

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttThere's coffee inside... I was just 
ttbringing this to Tom.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWould you mind if I did? I'd like to 
tttalk to him.

tDiane, knowing full well Tom ain't in a talking mood, hands 
ther a cup...

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttSure.
ttt(seeing Grace in car)
ttDoes your daughter want to come 
ttinside?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttUh, no, we're going to dinner... Is 
ttthis the way to the pasture?

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttPasture? Oh, that stretch of field near 
ttthe hill? Yeah.

tShe's gone. Annie grimaces, then crosses the hillside to 
twhere Tom is squatting down. She appears to his side and, 
twithout speaking, tries to indicates she has his coffee by 
tleaning it toward him. Tom sees her and accepts it with a 
tgrateful nod. Annie waits. Nothing happens. Feeling foolish, 
tshe begins to walk back.

tAt some point, she turns to see Pilgrim moving across the 
tpasture toward Tom. He stops in front of him, just a few feet 
taway. Tom says something to him. Annie is intrigued -- and she 
tknows enough to stay quiet now. She watches Pilgrim walk over 
tto him. She watches as Tom gets up and pats Pilgrim's scarred 
thead. In spite of herself, Annie is somewhat moved by this act.

tOnly we see Grace, peering out from the car, seeing this act 
tof communion as well. Only we see her reaction to it.

tAs Tom turns and walks back to the ranch, Pilgrim follows him. 
tAs he passes Annie, all he says is...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttFrom now on, leave your phone 
ttsomewhere else...

tAs he moves past her, Annie responds;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttBut I have business calls I have 
ttto --

tTom keeps heading for the barn as he suggests, without turning 
tback;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttThen drop off Grace in the morning, 
ttgo on back and do your business. 
ttCome pick her up around dinner.

tStanding there, Annie has the impulse to respond to this 
tsuggestion, but has no idea what to say and saying it wouldn't 
tmake much sense since Tom is already out of ear shot.

tDiane appears from the house and calls out:

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttMrs. MacLean -- why don't you and 
ttdaughter stay for dinner?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to 
ttimpose.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttNo imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna 
ttget pretty dark soon. Hard to find a 
ttplace.

tAnnie looks up to the alien sky and realizes she's right. She 
tlooks to Grace, who doesn't seem to oppose the idea.

<b>tINT. RANCH HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
tEveryone sits around the kitchen table. Joe, still wearing 
this hat, eyes Annie and Grace with acute curiosity.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttJoe, take off the hat -- I'm not 
ttgoing to say it again.

tJoe obeys. Diane puts the last of the serving plates on the 
ttable -- pork chops, potatoes, gravy, peas, bread... And a big 
tbowl of mixed salad. The boy can't help eyeing how the 
t"vegetarians" will act.

tAnnie and Grace eye the food. Annie reaches out for a serving 
tladle, picking up Grace's plate to serve her as Grace reaches 
tfor a piece of bread, when:

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttDear Lord, we are humbly thankful 
ttfor...

tAnnie and Grace freeze as Frank continues his prayer -- they 
tnotice everyone's head bowed slightly.

<b>tttt  FRANK

ttthese gifts. For the blessings on our 
tthome, our family and our guests. Bless 
ttthose that aren't as fortunate. Bless 
ttall God's creatures.

</b>ttAmen.

tEveryone begins eating. Annie and Grace breath a sigh of relief. 
tSilence. Utensils hitting plates, the only sound.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttBank out us a couple more men to run 
ttthe cattle.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWe should be fine, then.

tBeat. Annie and Grace listen...

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttTeacher asked me why we raise Black 
ttAngus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttTell her they suit the weather better. 
ttTheir udders are black, 'stead of pink.

</b>ttThey don't get burned by the sun bouncing 
ttoff the snow. And they're good mother.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttOur daddy raised Pure Herefords.

tSilence... Eating... Annie tries her hand at conversation:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou know, that's interesting. I always 
ttwondered when I went into a restaurant 
ttwhat was the difference between a regular 
ttsteak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't

ttthere was that big a difference between

ttI've never been on a cow farm before. I

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttWell, get born a bull, got a ninety

<b>tttt  ANNIE

ttIt's fine. Comfortable. I still can't

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttt(innocently)
ttYou know, Tom, while you're working on 
ttthat horse of theirs, Annie and Grace 
ttshould move into the old Creek house.

tDiane and Tom react accordingly; Diane hiding her annoyance, 
tTom hiding his surprise and pleasure.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttNobody's using it. Silly for her to be 
ttdriving back and forth when she don't 
ttknow her way around that well...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh, I don't know...

ton the couch. The two women remain separate no matter where 
tthey are.

tBut we see a small difference. Grace rises and walks to the 
twindow. She looks out;

tPOV: She sees people working about the ranch. Maybe Joe is 
tamong them -- riding his horse as he works. Or maybe it's 
tjust a vision of people with tasks to complete -- who do so 
twith pride, discipline and clarity.

tGrace looks out the window longingly.

<b>tEXT. THE RANCH - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
tA cloud of dust. A dozen or so horses are running in an arena 
tby the stables. Tom is riding among them, holding a long stick 
twith an orange flag at the end of it, waving it at the young 
thorses, making them run away from him. The colts stay close 
ttogether. One of the horses, PILGRIM, stays at a distance, off 
tto himself.

tGrace watches from along the railing. She alternates her 
tattention from the horses... to Tom.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>tt What we're doing here, Grace, is 
tt trying to get him to learn how to 
tt be a horse again.

tHe cracks the flag, the horses move together...

<b>tt  t t  TOM
</b>ttThe others already know, see. That's 
tthow they are in the wild -- herd 
ttanimals...
ttt(cracks the flag)
tt...When they've got a problem, like 
ttthey have now with me and this flag, 
ttthey look to each other. But old 
ttPilgrim there has forgotten. I'm the 
ttrock and they're the hard place. He 
ttthinks he hasn't got a friend in the 
ttwhole wild world...

tC.U. on GRACE, who clearly feels the same way... but wants 
tdesperately not to. She watches him ride off towards Pilgrim 
twho has stopped like all the others at the far end of the 
tring. He stands by himself, tossing his head, snorting, not 
twanting to be around other horses. Tom cracks the flag, 
tkeeping them moving. Pilgrim does his own private dance.

tTom rides by Grace and hands her the stick;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHold this for a minute...

tGrace stiffens. She doesn't want to, but she's afraid to say 
t"No" to Tom. He just insists by tossing it to her...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHold onto it, go on...

tShe's forced to catch it. He turns and rides away, chasing 
tdown Pilgrim, trying to edge him toward the herd. For a 
tmoment, he has him breaking to the left with the horses. But 
tas soon as he's clear of Tom, he separates himself and comes 
tto stop on his own.

tTom rides back to Grace, taking back the flag.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWe'll get there, Grace.

tAs he says this, he flashes a small, reassuring smile and a 
tlittle wink. Grace melts just a little. As he rides away.

tAnnie appears, having come from the Creek House. She calls:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttGrace? The clinic just called... 
ttThey had to change your physical 
tttherapy appointment. We have to 
ttleave now.

tGrace frowns a little -- her mother's "perfect timing." Annie 
tapproaches the arena, watching Tom riding. As he passes her;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHello, Annie...

tAnnie notices how he says her name.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttMr. Booker...

tHe flashes a smile in her direction and Annie's expression 
tcomically matches her daughter's reaction. She quickly covers 
tit, however. Her eyes follow him as he glides around the 
tarena. It's like watching a great ballet -- his control of the 
thorses, his effortlessness, his grace, his strength... She 
tsmiles to herself in appreciation. Then catches herself:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(to Grace)
ttYou got everything you need?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttIf I had everything I need, I wouldn't 
ttbe going to physical therapy.

tTom approaches as he overhears Grace respond;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt  (trying to cheer her)
ttHoney, come on. Would you like to stay 
ttin town for dinner? Maybe see what 
ttmovie's playing tonight?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhy? There's no food in the house?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttNo. I just thought... forget it.

tHe's getting a clearer view of their relationship.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou know, we're branding here 
tttomorrow. If you two want to come 
ttby to watch or give a hand, you're 
ttwelcome.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(laughs)
ttBranding?
ttt(sarcastic)
ttI haven't branded in years.

tTom chuckles.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI'll come.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttUh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... 
ttI think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's 
ttway.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttAs long as you don't get in the way of 
ttthe branding iron, it doesn't matter too 
ttmuch.

tAnnie smiles. She turns to Grace, questioningly. Grace says 
tmatter-of-factly, to prove her point.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI watched Margo Neuberger get a 
tttattoo.

tTom squints. Annie shrugs and nods.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOkay.

tAs Grace and Annie walk to the car, Tom says:

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHey, Grace -- maybe we can get your 
ttmom to put me and you branding on the 
ttcover of her magazine. Start a whole 
ttnew fashion craze.

tThey continue walking as Grace smiles, enjoying being singled 
tout for his joke. Annie responds, almost flirtatiously.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttTry not to fall off your high horse, 
ttMr. Booker.

tTom tips his hat and rides away... Annie smiles and nods... 
tGrace doesn't like their sudden familiarity. Or her mother's 
tcoy manner. As they enter the Suburban, Grace asks point blank;

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttDid you call Dad today?

tAnnie is caught off guard.

tTom, riding in the arena, catches himself looking after them... 
tthen goes riding after Pilgrim.

<b>tEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY
</b>
tThe air smells of scorched flesh. There is nothing but NOISE. 
tCalves, separated from their mothers, "cry." They are moved 
tout through a series of connected pens into a narrow chute, 
tand then one by one into a holding pen. They're clamped and 
tlowered sideways onto a table and given a shot, a yellow 
tinsect tag in one ear, branded, then sent back to their 
tmother's. The bulls, in a pen by themselves, stand haughty, 
tpaying no attention. Frank helps "doctor" the calves. Joe 
tbrands.

tAnnie and Grace are standing by the railing, watching with a 
tmixture of fascination and disgust.

tTom moves in the feeder pen, waist deep in calves, moving them 
tthrough the chute. He looks to Annie.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHey, over there, you want to make 
ttyourself useful?

tIt isn't a question.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHank, I got you a volunteer!

tAnnie and Grace realize they have no choice.

<b>t-- WHAT FOLLOWS IS A SEQUENCE OF SCENES SHOWING ANNIE AND 
</b><b>tGRACE PARTICIPATING IN THE BRANDING. AND HOW THEY GRADUALLY 
</b><b>tCOME TO LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE EXPERIENCE.
</b>
<b>tSEQUENCES WILL INCLUDE:
</b>
<b>t-- HANK, A RANCH HEAD, HELPING ANNIE INTO THE CHUTE... ANNIE 
</b><b>tGETTING KICKED BY A CALF.
</b>
<b>t-- GRACE BEING SHOWN HOW TO HOLD THE BRANDING IRON.
</b>
<b>t-- HANK TEACHING ANNIE HOW TO SAY "HYAH!!"...
</b>
<b>t-- TOM IN THE HOLDING PEN WITH HIS ARMS AROUND GRACE, SHOWING 
</b><b>tHER HOW TO APPLY THE BRAND... GRACE, A LITTLE FRIGHTENED OF THE 
</b><b>tBRAND, IS IN HEAVEN IN TOM'S ARMS...
</b>
<b>t-- ANNIE IS STILL TRYING TO SAY "HYAH"!! WITH THE PROPER FORCE. 
</b><b>tSHE CLAPS HER HANDS, PUSHING THE CALVES ALONG, KNEE DEEP IN 
</b><b>tCOW SHIT.
</b>
<b>t-- GRACE CLOSES HER EYES AND THE IRON TOUCHES THE CALF'S HIDE.
</b>
<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttThat's good... firm but gentle...
ttt(Grace opens her eyes)
ttIt hurts but he'll get over it.

tGrace smiles proudly.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou handled that pretty well. Think 
ttit's time you earn your keep around 
tthere. So, when we're not working 
ttand when you don't have your therapy, 
ttI'd like you to help out with the 
tthorses... Rubbing them, cleaning up 
ttthe stalls... You think you can 
tthandle that?

tGrace knows him well enough to know;

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttThat's not a question, is it?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou're catching on.

tGrace smiles.

t-- Annie turns and, not looking where she's doing, trips over 
ta calf, falling down. And calves, coming down the chute, 
tstart to run towards her. Suddenly, Tom grabs her by the leg 
tand pulls her to safety. He helps her up and dusts her off.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(not wanting to smile, 
ttt but...)
ttYou okay?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIt is cocktail hour yet?

tTom laughs. She takes a big breath.

<b>tEXT. THE RANCH - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
tThe ranch is colored in amber light.

tNear the house, two long tables pushed together to make one 
tlong one... A gentle breeze ruffles the tablecloth. Everyone 
tis seated for a meal. We hear laughter and conversation... We 
tparachute into the middle of the moments;

t-- Hank helping with his wife get to their three children to 
tsit still for dinner...

t-- Diane organizing the women and their various plates of side 
tdishes...

t-- The Ranch Hand piling up their plates and kidding each 
tother...

t-- Joe is instructing Grace on the various sauces for the 
tribs. The Twins are making fun of him behind his back.

t-- Tom and Smokey are barbecuing, the last one to sit.

t-- Frank assists his frail mother, ELLEN BOOKER, at the table, 
tfilling her plate with all the things she can't reach for.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
tThe faces are beautiful. Laughing. Eating. Everyone is tanned 
tand exhausted after a long day, but filled with life and 
teager to live it. The tables are covered with heavy food. 
tThe communion at this table is as much a part of the ritual 
tas the branding itself...

tAnnie and Grace look different to us. Tanned from the sun, 
ttheir bodies sore -- they feel softened, yet more vital. As if 
tthe artifice had been worn off... the armor of urban life. As 
tthe table thrives with conversations, we focus on:

tAnnie and Ellen Booker. Annie looks calmer than we've seen 
ther -- and more naturally beautiful. She is seated beside 
tEllen Booker. We sense they have been talking for a while. 
tAnnie is so sincerely interested in listening to her, she's 
thardly touched her own plate...

<b>tttt  ELLEN BOOKER
</b>tt... he was a blacksmith by trade, my 
ttfather. My grandson Joe was named 
ttfor him. But he always dreamed of 
tthaving his own place and raising 
tthorses...

tWe see Tom a few places down and across from Annie and his 
tmother -- but fully aware of their conversation.

<b>tttt  ELLEN BOOKER
</b>ttHe'd heard of some land. What's 
ttStockett now. Rode out there. Got off 
tthis horse and walked about as far as 
tthe could in one way. Then he walked as 
ttfar as he could another way and 
ttanother until he got back to where he 
ttstarted and that's where he put his 
ttroots down... That's where my husband 
ttand I ranched and raised Frank and 
ttTommy...

tShe motions proudly to Tom who looks up. Annie smiles to him. 
tHe looks to her with gratitude for the respect she's showing 
this mother.

<b>tttt  ELLEN BOOKER
</b>ttQuite a different life from what you 
ttknow, I expect. Which place to you 
ttcall home?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell, I was born in London, but my 
ttfather was an ambassador and we 
ttmoved constantly. I've lived in a lot 
ttof places but I don't really know what 
ttI'd call home.

tTom listens to this.

<b>tttt  ELLEN BOOKER
</b>ttAn ambassador! My! That's very 
ttimportant.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHe was a wonderful man.

tShe looks to Tom and he can sense a sadness around this in her 
teyes.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttt(to Grace)
ttI sure hope you're gonna eat more 
ttthan that, young lady. You're a 
ttgrowing girl.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI've never eaten this much in my 
ttlife.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttProbably never worked so hard, 
ttneither. Those arms of yours are 
ttgonna be pretty sore tomorrow. I'll 
ttgive you a little bit of ointment I 
ttmake. It's a magic recipe my Mama 
ttgave me.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttWe used to call Diane's mother 
ttMedicine Woman. None of us never went 
ttto the doctor when she was alive.

tAnnie and Grace listen in...

<b>tttt  HANK
</b>ttToo bad she wasn't here for old 
ttHenry Vanoker...

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttNot much would have helped him.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttI never got that whole story, what 
tthappened?

<b>tttt  HANK
</b>ttOld Henry was changing a flat tire on 
tthis truck over on 118 when that...
ttt(laughs)
tt... two-hundred-year-old jack he has 
ttgives way and the side of that truck 
ttcome slamming down on that rock he 
ttcalls head...

tThere's laughter -- everyone knows Old Henry. Except:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat happened?

<b>tttt  HANK
</b>ttKnocked him out for a while. He woke 
ttup, finished putting on the tire and 
ttdrove himself to the hospital.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttOld Fool... Darling, pass down those peas 
ttfor me, thank you.

tAnnie and Grace don't know how to respond... But everyone else 
ttakes it their stride as they continue eating...

tGrace notices Joe is whispering something to Frank, who nods 
this head and speaks to the table.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttHuh, Joe here has something to say.

tJoe stands, somewhat formally, with his hat on.

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttI wrote this for you Grandma...

tMrs. Booker, and Diane, beam. Annie and Grace don't know what 
tto expect. Joe stands straight as an arrow and recites a poem 
tfrom memory...

tAt first, Annie and Grace appear to be embarrassed for the boy 
tbut soon they can't help but be won over by his guilessness. 
tHe finishes and everyone applauds. Hank's wife asks:

<b>tttt  HANK'S WIFE
</b>ttThat was lovely. Who wrote that, 
ttJoe?

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttI wrote it myself, ma'am.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttNow son, you tell 'em when it came 
ttfrom.

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttBe honest, I can't say I did it all 
ttmyself. My grandma helped me get the 
ttwords right.

tOOoo's and aah's and smiles and conversations erupting over 
teach other.

tOnly we see, Grace looking over to Joe who gives her kickass, 
tshy grin...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(raising his beer)
ttWell, I'd like to welcome Annie and 
ttGrace to their first branding...

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttAnd next time, Miss Annie, you can run 
ttdown the calves...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI'll drink to that...

tEveryone toasts and drinks. Annie and Tom exchange a look. 
tShe smiles, but not in a alluring way -- rather, in a grateful 
tway. Grateful for this brief moment of community and good 
tfeeling. And somehow, Tom knows what she's feeling.

tNo one notices this silent exchange -- except for Diane, who 
tsees everything that's going on.

<b>tINT. RANCH HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHTFALL
</b>
tThe Women are bringing in dishes and plates and food from the 
ttables through the house and into the kitchen. Annie is among 
tthem, feeling apart of the group. She enters carrying a large 
tbowl, that held the corn.

tDiane is replacing newly-cleaned forks and knives in her 
tdining room drawers, above which are several FAMILY PICTURES.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(referring to clean bowl)
ttWhere does this go, Diane?

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttOh, you can just set up on the dining 
tttable. I have to rearrange my shelves 
tttomorrow.

tAnnie complies. She notices the framed pictures on the wall in 
tthe dining room.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIs this Mr. Booker? Tom's 
ttgrandfather?

tDiane looks at a faded photo circa late 1800's.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttMm-mm. I never knew him. He died 
ttbefore Frank and I met. This here's...
ttt(another photo)
ttFrank and Tom's mother and father... 
ttthere's little Frank and Tom...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttShe calls him Tommy...

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttAlways did. I think she favored him a 
ttlittle. You tend to when you have more 
ttthan one, even though you love 'em all 
ttthe same.

tShe studies the old faces of Tom's Parents -- although 20th 
tCentury people, there is still a pioneering strength in their 
tvisage... a stoicism and power.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttt(putting away forks)
ttHa, she loves telling this story about 
tthow when he was two years old, he ran off. 
ttThey found him in the barn, sleeping 
ttbetween two giant hooves of a Percheron 
ttstallion. She said that horse was 
ttprotecting him and nobody could convince 
tther otherwise.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI got a little confused though. The ranch 
ttEllen was talking about -- that's not this 
ttone?

tDiane is sorting silverware throughout the following:

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttNo. See, Frank and Tom were raised near 
ttthe Clark's Fork River, right between the 
ttPryor and Beartooth Mountains. Beautiful 
ttpiece of land. But they had this uncle 
ttNed -- useless man, never interested in 
ttranching. And when the grandparents died, 
tthe left for the city and sent word 
ttthrough lawyers he wanted his claim to 
ttthe land so he could sell it. Three years 
ttof legation broke their father. Frank took 
ttit all in stride, but Tom... Tom loved that 
ttland. I don't think he ever got over it -- 
ttHis home being sold out from under him. 
ttSeeing his father like that. Once he and 
ttFrank got their folks set up in a new 
ttplace, Tom left... went off. We didn't see 
tthim for years...

tAnnie is intrigued by what she's learning about Tom. 
tSomething outside the window catches her eyes. She watches:

<b>tPOV;
</b><b>t
</b>tTom and Frank, on either side to Ellen, are escorting her to 
ta car that will drive her home.

<b>tEXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tAnnie wanders out, passing Grace and Joe on her way out. The two 
tare sitting in a glider. As Annie exits O.C., we hear them;

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhy do you always wear that hat?

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttBecause it fits my head. You want to 
tttry it on?

tGrace doesn't know if she should.

tAnnie continues towards Tom who's sitting in a rocker playing 
twith the twins.

<b>tttt  TWINS
</b>ttShow us again! Come on! One more time! 
ttIt's my turn now!

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttAll right, al right. Hold out your 
ttfinger.

tAnnie takes a seat nearby and watches as Tom holds out the 
tfirst finger of his right hand. The Twins holds out his. Tom 
tsplits his focus between Annie and the Twins as he takes a 
tsmall piece of rope out of his back pocket. He ties the ends 
ttogether making a loop. He puts the loop over the Twin's 
tfinger. And holding the other end of the loop taut with his 
tleft hand, he draws one side of the cord over the other with 
tthe middle finger of his right hand. Then he rolls his hand 
tover so it's under the loop, and back over it again, so that 
this finger is tip to tip with the Twin's. The loop seemingly 
tknotted around their touching fingertips, and can only be 
tremoved if their touch is broken.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttThe loop's knotted, right.
ttt(Twins nod)
ttLooks like the only way to take it 
ttoff, is if we break our touch...
ttt(they nod)
ttWatch now...

tAnnie and the Twins look down at the touching fingers as Tom 
tgently pulls the rope away, revealing they are still knotted, 
tand without even breaking their touch...

<b>tttt  TWINS
</b>ttAgain! Again. One more time!

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttOh, no. No, no. I only fall for that 
ttonce. Go inside now before your mother 
ttstarts hunting you down. Go on.

tThe Twins exit. Annie and Tom make eye contact.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(smiles, relaxes back)
ttSo how was your first and last day of 
ttbranding?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDon't be so sure it's my last. There 
ttare a few people back home I'd like 
ttto put under a red hot iron.

tTom looks at her with a sly expression, and notices she's 
tshivering.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou got too much sun today... 
ttHere...

tHe takes his jacket and puts it around her shoulders.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThank you.

tHe sits back down. Annie crosses her arms over her chest, 
tlooks around, unconsciously swinging her foot. Tom watches 
ther leg. Annie notices him watching;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou ever just stand still for a 
ttminute?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou stand still too long in New York 
ttyou get hit by a bicycle messenger.
ttt(smiles wryly)
ttYou know, sometimes, I get the feeling, 
ttMr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. 
ttWhy is that?

tTom shrugs. Annie waits a beat, then:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThat's your cue to say you're not 
ttlaughing at me.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttOh, I see, you write both sides of the 
ttconversation?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIt's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most 
ttwomen have to.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWell, maybe I am laughing a bit... I 
ttjust thought, as long as you're here, 
ttit would be nice for you to relax into 
ttthe place a little.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(understanding)
ttWell... It's beautiful country, I'll give 
ttyou that. And I could see having some 
ttkind of vacation place. Retreat. But I 
ttdon't know how you do it full time. Don't 
ttyou miss the rest of the world?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWhat's that to miss?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHa... if you've never lived in a city 
ttwith museums, theater, music, restaurants, 
ttuh... god, a million things, then it's 
ttsomething I can't explain.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(thinks, teasing a bit)
ttDoes Chicago count?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(surprised)
ttYou lived in Chicago?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWhen I was first married.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(stunned)
ttYou were married to a woman in 
ttChicago?

tTom likes disturbing her picture of him as the predictable 
tcowboy. He smiles;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star 
ttwith the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. 
ttHe played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. 
ttNo. 14. It was one of the most beautiful 
ttpieces of music I ever heard. I actually 
ttforgot where I was for a time.
ttt(Annie is floored)
ttYou seem surprised?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(not wanting to insult)
ttWell, I, uh... you didn't...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttJust who's been laughing at who here?

tTom says this with a wry smile. Annie returns with a smile -- 
tas an understanding is reached between them: they've both 
tstereotyped the other. They are both pleased -- and attracted -- 
tby what they don't know.

<b>tINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tGrace is fast asleep, exhausted. She does not stir when the 
tphone rings.

tAnnie picks up from her own bed, awakened, still dressed in 
ther branding clothes, having just passed out on the bed.

</b>ttHello?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI thought you guys were going to call 
ttme.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired 
ttfrom the branding. Grace barely made it 
ttto her bed and I didn't have the energy 
ttto take my clothes off.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttOh well... branding will do that to you.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttEverything all right.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttHuh-huh. You?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttFine. Actually, today was a good day. 
ttYou should have seen her.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI wish I did.

tThe sound of self-pity was so obvious for both of them, so 
tRobert quickly re-groups, resorting to something he knows is 
timportant to her;

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttWell, uh the real reason I called, 
ttactually, was to tell you I saw Lucy

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttAbout what?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttApparently, Gottschalk's been seen around

ttmagazine editors. Lucy said she tried to 
ttcall you, but no one answered so she faxed 
ttyou the list of names. She said one of

ttyour position. Listen, if you need to 
ttcome back and you want me to come take 
ttover, for a while, I'll work it out. I 
ttmean, the firm's got other lawyers, but 
ttthe magazine's got only one of you.

tAfter a day of hard work and simple pleasures, Annie begins to 
tsuccumb to old anxieties and pressures.

<b>tINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tAnnie is awake reading the faxes Lucy sent. One after other. 
tAs she flips through them, one falls to the floor near the bed.

tShe gets down on all fours to retrieve and sees something 
tunder the bed. AN OLD, BATTERED CELLO CASE. She pulls it out 
tto find the initials R.B. carved on the top. She opens it to 
tfind papers, receipts, bills -- all from Tom's married life.

<b>tEXT. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
tTom rides a young colt along the creek. He hears footsteps. 
tHe turns and sees Annie running along the creek on the other 
tside. He stops to watch. When his horse SNORTS, Annie looks 
tup to see him. She stops. He tips his hat to her.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI've decided it's impossible to 
ttproperly say hello in this place 
ttwithout a hat.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttA jogger, huh?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttLucky for you. The grizzlies around 
tthere only go for joggers.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIf I can survive rush hour, I figure I 
ttcan handle grizzlies...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(smiles)
ttYou sleeping all right in that house?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI don't sleep all right anywhere. But 
ttthe house is fine.

tTom walks his horse across the creek to her, comfortable in 
tthe silence. Annie moves about, uncomfortable in the waiting.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWho's R.B.?

tTom is finding Annie's blunt curiosity more endearing.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI found this old cello case filled with 
ttbills and receipts.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttSorry about that. I thought everything 
ttgot cleared out. R.B. is my wife... 
ttex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in 
ttthat house 
tttogether.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI thought you lived in Chicago?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI thought you were an editor, not a 
ttreporter?

tAnnie smiles and nods, realizing she's asking too many questions. 
tShe tries to casually reach out to touch the horse's head, but 
tit's too abrupt and the horse tosses his head away, taking a 
tcouple of steps back. Annie is embarrassed.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI have a way with animals.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttIt's all right. He's young. Just hold 
ttout your hand a little lower so he can 
ttget the smell of you.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh yes. I forgot.

tShe does and the horse sniffs at her hand.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHe's beautiful.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWhy don't you ride anymore? Grace told 
ttme you used to ride when she was 
ttyounger.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttShe did?

tAnnie is somewhat moved by her daughter telling him that.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI don't know, really. No time mostly.

tA cold wind blows. She folds her arms across her breasts.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI thought it was supposed to be spring.

tTom can't help but notice her nipples are hard from the cold. 
tHe looks away. She laughs.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttAre you shy, Mr. Booker?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttJust polite. Well, maybe you'd like 
ttto try riding again, some time before 
ttyou go home.

tAnnie is struck by the words "before you go home." Tom ambles 
toff on his horse.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttEnjoy the day.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou too.

tAnnie steps across the rocks at the ford, crossing the creek. 
tHer foot slips, one of her shoes goes into the water.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttShit.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttNeed a lift?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI can handle it!

tShe crosses the creek. She turns, giving him a small wave. He 
ttouches his hat. She runs off. Tom watches her go, head down, 
tconcentrating...

tDuring David's lines, Diane has entered, carrying fresh towels 
t-- she crosses into the bathroom.

</b>ttOh, come on! This is such bullshit! The 
ttwork is getting done, David. Lucky keeps

</b>ttLucy isn't you. We're losing something

tWithout Annie's awareness, Diane re-enters and takes her time 
tleaving, so she can take in all of Annie's things; her 
tbusiness "office," books, etc...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat the hell does that mean? How much

<b>tttt  DAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.)
</b>ttIf this magazine is so important to you

tDiane can't help but notice a slight vulnerability in Annie.

</b>ttLook, this is what we're going to do.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttUh, yes... Sure, David.

<b>tttt  DAVID GOTTSCHALK (V.O.)
</b>ttAll right. Speak to you then.

tAnnie doesn't know whether or not to accept.

tBefore she finishes her line, the Phone Rings again.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttSorry.
ttt(to phone)
ttHello? Hi, yeah, I just spoke to him. 
ttOh, you know David, Mr. Strong Arm...

tDiane feels out of place and exits. Annie doesn't notice 
tuntil she hears the door close. She pushes back her hair and 
ttakes a deep breath. She looks out through the side window 
tand sees:

tGrace and Joe doing chores. Grace looks involved and not at 
tall self-conscious. A moment of gratitude and calm for Annie.

<b>tEXT. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY
</b>
tPilgrim bursts out of a chute and into the riding arena. He 
truns to the far end and abruptly stops. Tom is holding the 
torange flagstick, and coiled rope, coming through a gate 
tinto the arena, crossing to the middle of the ring. Something 
tin his demeanor tells us that fun and game are over.

tPilgrim and Tom stand there, motionless, eyeing each other. 
tPilgrim snorts and takes a few, small steps backward. Tom 
ttakes a beat, then starts slowly towards Pilgrim, lifting the 
tflag and "cracking" it. At the sound, Pilgrim whirls away from 
thim and runs, around the arena. He starts to slow, looking at 
tTom. Again, Tom cracks the flag and Pilgrim runs, round and 
tround the arena... like a ringmaster, Tom keeps Pilgrim 
tmoving, cracking the flag.

tSomething about Tom's demeanor tells us it isn't going well.

<b>tEXT. THE RANCH - DAY
</b>
tTom, carrying a saddle, comes around the side of the barn. 
tThrough the slats, he sees Grace working in the barn, 
twatering a horse. She has stopped and is looking through the 
tcracks of Pilgrim's stall at him. She turns and sees Tom 
tthrough the slats. She goes back to work as Tom comes to the 
tbarn door.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttCome and take a ride with me.

<b>tEXT. THE RANCH - DAY

</b>ttCan you drive?

</b>ttDrive? I'm not old enough yet.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttIt's never too soon to start.

tHe enters the passenger side.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI can't...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI don't have all day.

tShe hesitates and gets into the truck.

tGrace doesn't know what to do.

</b>ttPut the key in and turn it.
ttt(Grace obeys)
ttThe right pedal is gas, the other 
ttone's the brake.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI don't know if I can with my leg.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWell, there's only one way to find out.
ttt  (puts truck in gear)
ttGive it a little gas.

tShe awkwardly puts her prosthetic foot on the gas pedal. Too 
tmuch. It lurches forward. She takes her foot off.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWell, we know you can. Now you just 
ttgot to feel how much. Try it again.

tShe does. They slowly, very slowly, move along the dirt road.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttNice, real nice. There's a little 
ttroad down at the end here, turn onto 
ttit.

tGrace badly oversteers, but makes the turn. She drives along 
tthe road, across a pasture, heading toward distant mountains.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttJust follow this. Nothing to it. I'm 
ttgoing to shut my eyes here for a 
ttlittle while. Just keep going till 
ttyou run out of road.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt(afraid)
ttI don't know if I can.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttNot a question of if you can -- you 
ttare. Just keep your eyes on the road 
ttand your foot on the pedal and the 
ttrest will take care of yourself.

tFolding his arms over his chest, shutting his eyes, Tom 
trelaxes back. Grace locks her hand on the steering wheel and 
ther eyes straight ahead...

<b>tEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY
</b>
tThe truck is parked at the foot of a mountain. Grace, very 
tpleased with herself, sits beside Tom on the cab's roof, 
tlooking around them at the great Montana. After a beat;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWhere did you get Pilgrim from?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWe bought him in Kentucky. My mother 
ttand I took a trip down there to see 
tthim.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttThat must have been pretty special.

tGrace nods. It is a pleasant memory. He motions for her to be 
tquiet. An old ELK with a prodigious rack of antlers, has come 
tdown out of the mountains. Seeing them, he stops in his 
ttracks, dead still. They watch each other. Then the elk turns 
tand runs back up into the mountains. Tom smiles at Grace who 
tsmiles back -- partly because of the elk, partly because she's 
talone with Tom.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttAre you afraid of anything?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(thinks)
ttGetting old. Not being of much use, 
ttI guess.
ttt(beat)
ttWhat went on out there, Grace? With 
ttPilgrim?

tGrace doesn't say anything. Tom nods then;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou see, Grace, I've got a problem. 
ttWhen I'm working with a horse, I like 
ttto know its history. Now, most times, 
ttthe horse can tell you pretty much the 
ttwhole story, but sometimes he can be 
ttso messed up in his head that you need 
ttmore to go on. You need to know exactly 
ttwhat went wrong. Often times, it's the 
ttobvious thing, but something that went 
ttwrong just before that, maybe even some 
ttlittle thing...

tGrace is quiet. She doesn't want to think about that.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttIt's like if I'm driving and run into 
tta tree. When somebody asks me, "Well, 
ttwhat happened?", I don't say, "Well, 
ttI plowed into a tree." I'd say, "The 
ttsun was in my eyes." or "I skidded." or 
tt"I took my mind off the road for a 
ttsecond." See what I mean?
ttt(Grace nods)
ttI don't know how you feel about talking 
ttabout it and I can understand you might 
ttnot want to. But if I'm going to figure 
ttout what's going on in his head, it'd 
ttsure help if I knew exactly what 
tthappened that day.

tGrace looks away. Tom smiles and gently puts his arm around 
ther shoulders, which has a soothing effect on Grace -- making 
ther feel safe...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttNot today -- whenever you feel like it. 
ttI leave it up to you.

tGrace looks into Tom's eyes, wanting so much to unburden herself 
tto him and have him make everything all right. She nods.

<b>tEXT. RANCH HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT
</b>
tTom is making his way to the house at the end of the day, when 
the stops and looks over to the Creek house --

tPOV -- the lights are on. And he can see Annie, exhausted... 
tapproving pages, talking on the phone and faxing all 
tsimultaneously.

tHe gets an idea.

<b>tEXT. CREEK HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
tAnnie sits on the porch of the creek house, with a guilt over 
therself, sipping coffee and deep in thought. She looks up to 
tsee:

tTom riding towards the house on his horse, leading another 
thorse behind him. He looks to her and smiles.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(murmurs)
ttOh-oh.

tTom reaches the house as Annie rises.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThe answer's no.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou haven't heard the question yet. Truth 
ttis, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all 
ttthese eager young colts need riding and 
ttpoor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of 
ttleft out...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttPoor thing.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHe'd be grateful, he'd take real good

</b>ttNo, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.

tShe gives him a crooked smile.

tthe pasture. We overhear them in the midst of talking.

</b>ttRelax our center... It's just sitting 
ttin a bucket.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYeah, it's been a while, but I... I 
ttremember the basic ideas...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttOK. I'll stop talking then.

tHe rides a few steps ahead as Annie realizes she doesn't 
tremember. She just went into automatic "I don't have to be 
ttold anything" mode.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttActually, I never rode Western. I'm 
ttsorry. Go ahead.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWell, he don't know that. Just sit the

ttGood... You have a nice seat.

</b>
tTom urges his horse into a center. Annie canters alongside.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWatch your reins, he'll go with you, 
ttgive him some room, let him do the 
ttwork. Relax, don't grab him with 
ttyour thighs, just so long as he can 
ttfeel your body.

tAnnie responds to every suggestion without resistance. And 
tshe experiences this sense of pleasure -- this great animal 
tbeneath her, the physicality and the surrender of letting 
tsomeone else lead...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou want to let it go some more?

tShe begins to let herself go, losing herself in the experience. 
tShe just nods... Tom breaks into a full gallop... Annie follows 
tsuit... She lets everything go -- her job, her marriage, 
tmotherhood, guilt, anxiety... all of it. Her only focus is the 
thorse beneath her, and the man on the horse leading her...

</b>
tThey ride through a narrow pass with sheer rock walls, riding 
tby a waterfall...

tThey ride across a meadow, cattle stepping lazily aside to 
tlet them pass. And as they ride alongside each other,

<b>tttttt LAP DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
tThey ride up along a sloping ridge covered with pine trees. 
tThey come to the rim of a high bluff. They stop. They look 
tout at the twin valleys that gave the ranch its name. And 
tthey can just see the old CREEK HOUSE hidden in the shade of 
tsome trees along the creek...

tTom looks over at Annie, who is looking out over this 
tbeautiful vista.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIt's a whole other world you have

tTom is impressed by her feelings. He sees her saddle cinch 
tneeds fixing and gets off his horse.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttLift your leg.

tAnnie complies once she realizes what he's doing.

<b>tttt  ANNIE

ttwas...

tTom can't find a beautiful enough word. But Annie understands.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttShe was the most beautiful thing I'd

the lost.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhy didn't it work out?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttShe was never really happy here. She did 
ttthe best she could.

tAnnie looks at him and for the first time senses a kinship -- 
tan understanding they both have of being torn between two 
tworlds... a desire for home...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttGrace told me you have a country house 
ttin Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful

</b>ttWe did at one point. When we thought 
ttwe'd have more children. And we after 
tttried. We tried everything, but... 
ttwasn't meant to be.

tThere is an awkward silent beat for a moment. Annie is 
tmomentarily self-conscious. Tom helps by speaking of himself;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI hear that! See, I knew she was never 
ttgoing to be a ranchest, but I wanted 
ttto try -- I thought maybe she'd give 
ttmusic lessons to the kids in town or at 
ttthe school, maybe even recitals. My son 
ttwould grow up here. Maybe have one or 
tttwo more. I'd teach 'em what I could. 
ttThey'd play with my brother's kids. All

ttkeep it for 'em...

ttHome.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYeah, I think it is. And I don't mean 
tteverybody's got to be married, have kids
tt-- It's more like, knowing where you're

ttwhere you can go no matter what happens... 
ttKnowing what you're supposed to be doing 
ttwhile you're here.

<b>tttt  ANNIE

</b>ttYou sure?

tAngry, determined, Grace tries to swing her leg onto the

</b>ttYou okay?

tShe gasps to catch her breath. He reaches to help her up. She 
tpulls her hand away. Embarrassed, she "runs" off. Joe remains

<b>tLIVING ROOM:
</b>
tThe room is silent because every Booker is READING A 
tDIFFERENT COPY OF ANNIE'S MAGAZINE. Frank covertly glimpses 
tat the scantily-clad models... The Twins sharing a magazine, 
tdoing the same thing as their father, but keeping an eye out 
tfor mom... Diane is looking at pictorial exposes on the kind 
tof lives she only hears about on audio tapes...

tTom sits off to the side, amused by the sight.

tGrace enters as Joe enters. They nod across the room to each 
tother with a little smile.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWould anyone like something to drink?

tWe hear a CRASH in the kitchen, then:

<b>tttt  ANNIE (O.S.)
</b><b>ttSHIT!
</b>
tEverybody looks up for a minute. The Twins giggle. Diane gives 
tthem a dirty look.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI'll give your mom a hand.

tDiane watches him enter the kitchen, then returns to her 
tmagazine.

<b>tINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tAnnie has dropped a hot pot into the sink, after pouring the 
ttomato out of it, and into a terrine.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttEverything under control?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(laughs)
ttNot really. I'd forgotten how long 
ttit's been since I've done this. And 
ttI couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttJust make yourself comfortable.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI am comfortable.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHa, ha... all right, well, uh I guess 
ttyou can bring out the pasta.

tShe undoes her apron and crosses towards the bowl. Tom's eyes 
tnever leave her. It's the first time he's seen her in her 
tdress, sans apron. As she lifts the bowl to hand to him, she 
trealizes he's been looking at her. There's a silent moment, 
tthen;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou missed a button.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHuh?

tShe looks for it. Tom crosses to her and buttons it, then 
ttakes the bowl.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThank you.

tThey're quiet for a beat as they exchange a look. Suddenly, 
tGrace enters -- she clearly doesn't like the two of them being 
talone, Annie quickly covers;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh, good, Grace, would you bring in 
ttthe bread... I'll get the salad and 
ttthen we're all set.

tTom has already exited by the time Annie finishes, and Grace 
tgrabs the bread basket.

<b>tINT. CREEK HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
tWe parachute into the middle of the meal. The spaghetti is a 
thit... We cut to different conversations and reactions around 
tthe table.

tFrank is in the middle of saying;

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttIt'd be a whole lot easier to pay 
ttthe feed end of the month...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI don't think Warren would go for that.

tGrace is talking to Joe and the Twins.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>tt... like, for instance, you can go on 
ttthe Internet and access this thing 
ttcalled The Visible Man -- who was this 
ttmurderer they caught in Texas that was 
ttexecuted and donated his body to 
ttscience and you can call him up on the 
ttscreen and dissect him, like in Three-D...

tGrace eats as she talks. Joe and the Twins are fascinated.

tAnnie asks Tom, Frank and Diane;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell, did you ever think about hiring 
tta business manager?

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttWe have a business manager. The best 
ttaround.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttHa...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttDiane takes care of the books. I don't 
ttknow how, but at the end of every 
ttmonth, everything adds up to the penny.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttAin't brain surgery.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIt's pretty impressive. Where I come 
ttfrom, you'd be a gold mine.

tDiane doesn't know how to accept that, but inside she's 
tbursting with pride. She focuses on the Twins who fight;

<b>tttt  TWINS
</b>ttThis is MY fork. That's YOUR fork, ya 
ttidiot!

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttHey. You stop that kind of talk at the 
tttable.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttI'll have another round of that 
ttspaghetti if may?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttAbsolutely. I made enough for an army.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttI uh... I like the sauce very much. Maybe 
ttI get the recipe.

tAnnie is so pleased and is about to reply, but Grace, noticing 
tTom smiling at Annie:

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttIt's from a jar.

tThere's an odd silence as a deflated Annie serves Frank.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttThank you.

tFinally, Diane saves it.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttWell, I tried jar sauce once -- 
ttwasn't this good. Ya gotta know 
ttwhich brand to buy. I'd like to 
ttget the name of this one.

tAnnie is grateful. Grace feels foolish.

<b>tttt  TWIN (SCOTT)
</b>ttCan we see the dead body on the 
ttscreen?

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttIt's just my computer.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttOh, I don't --

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIt's okay. Grace, show them. I'm going 
ttto put the coffee on. I made an apple 
tttart for dessert.

tThe Twins excitedly move to the computer. Joe waits for Grace.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttI'll help you with the coffee.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell... I know I should reject that 
ttoffer, but I'm not going to.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttt(jovial)
ttNo reason you should, no reason you 
ttshould.

tThey exit into the kitchen. Frank continues eating.

tTom looks around -- Grace showing the boys the computer. Annie 
tand Diane in the kitchen. For a second, we see Tom realize an 
timage of the life he once thought he could.

<b>tINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
tAs Diane and Annie prepare coffee and dessert;

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttI was looking in one of your magazines 
ttand saw that picture of the couple 
ttgetting married at the Pyramids. Were 
ttyou ever in Egypt?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI was there for that shot, actually.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttWhat was it like?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh, God -- I think it was the fourth 
ttor fifth time I'd been there, so all 
ttI remember was the heat and how 
ttincompetent the photographer was...

tShe laughs as she directs this last line to Diane, who just 
tsmiles. And Annie realizes that's not what she meant at all. 
tThis woman is starving for glimpses into this other life.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttBut, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like 
ttnothing else. It's like going back in 
tttime.
ttt(Diane listens)
ttI remember as a kid trying to imagine 
ttwhat a kid my age, centuries ago, 
ttwalking over that same ground, was 
ttwondering about or, if they had the 
ttsame problems as me... and I felt, 
ttconnected to... to time itself, almost. 
ttHa, I never realized how hard it was 
ttto describe.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttI'd love to go there one time...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou and Frank ever take a vacation?

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttSoon. We're going to Branson, Missouri 
ttto see my cousin Emma married. Frank 
ttloves in there.

tAnnie can sense the disappointment in her voice, and at the 
tsame time, the comfortable resignation.

tSuddenly, from inside, they hear LOUD OVERLAPPING VOICES as 
tthe children fight.

<b>tttt  TWIN (SCOTT)
</b><b>ttIT WAS MY TURN!

</b>ttYou never let me have a turn!

</b>ttWhat does he mean?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttNothing.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDid you go riding?

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttLittle shit!

tJoe lunges for Scott and the two start rolling in a fight. 
tFrank and Tom work to pull them apart as Diane yells.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttAnnie, I'm so sorry, but they're just 
tttired. We'll have dessert another time. 
ttFrank, get them out of here.
ttt(to other Twin)
ttCome on. Say good night and thank 
ttyou...

tVoices everywhere. Yelling. "Thank you's!!" During which, 
tGrace quickly turns and exits. Annie eyes follow her out of 
tthe room, but with her guests and the chaos, she doesn't know 
twhether or not to leave.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttDinner was delicious. Thank you.
ttt(to Twins)
ttSay thank you!!

tDiane and Frank usher the kids out. Tom holds onto Joe until 
tthey're gone, then lets him go.

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttSorry, ma'am, I thank you for dinner. 
ttIt was very good.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDid Grace try to ride, Joe?

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttt(hesitates)
ttI expect you should talk to Grace about 
ttthat, ma'am. And if I did anything 
ttwrong, then I am sorry.

tEver the gentlemen, Joe exits. Annie looks to Tom. He's about 
tto leave, when he stops and says:

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttDon't let her turn you away.

tTom exits.

tAnnie stands and faces Grace's closed door. Slowly, she 
tlowers herself to her knees and sits on them, thinking... 
treminiscent of Tom, waiting for his moment with Pilgrim, in 
tthe field.

<b>tINT. CREEK HOUSE, GRACE'S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
tWe don't know how long Annie waited, but she knocks gently, 
tthen enters to find Grace, in her nightgown, on her bed, with 
tthe night stand light on. Her prosthesis is against the wall.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttGrace? Is everything all right?
ttt(no answer)
ttCan we talk?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttAbout what?

<b>tttt  ANNIE

</b>ttt(snotty)
ttYeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

</b>ttYou... not wanting to go home because

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttGrace, I don't hate your father.

</b>ttI can't remember the last time you 
ttmade him dinner.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI was just trying to say thank you to 
ttDiane and Frank and --

tAnnie sits by the bed, Grace moves away a little.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttLook, I just wanted to say, I think 
ttit's great you're riding again. 
ttAnd... and I think I know why you,

</b>ttt(angry)
ttWHAT?! How can you --

ttI'm sorry if my friendship with Tom

</b>ttWell, now you know what it feels like.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI don't deserve that. I have never

ttI'm on your back to do better, if I 
ttpush you to try harder it's because 
ttI want you to be the best you can be.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttFOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter

ttIsn't that what you're always talking

</b>ttWell, then I do apologize... But what

ttcan't forgive when she's not.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b><b>ttLEAVE ME ALONE!!
</b>
tAnnie stops to exit as Grace says something under her breath. 
tAnnie stops.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat did you say?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI said... I started.

tGrace starts to sob. Annie doesn't understand.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttStarted what?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttMy period.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(softer)
ttWhen? Tonight?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt(nods)
ttI felt it happen downstairs and when 
ttI went into the bathroom.

tAnnie reaches down to touch Grace's shoulder. Grace turns -- 
tthere is no anger in her face. Annie sits and takes her in 
ther arms. Grace clings to her and sobs like a little girl. 
tAnnie sees tears run -- gratefully, lovingly.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWho's going to want me now?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat?... Oh baby...

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWho's ever going to want me? Nobody 
ttwill.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThat's not true.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhy should they?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttBecause you are... one of the most...

ttt(laughs thru tears)
ttI don't know where you got it? I 
tthonestly don't know how I would have 
tthandled all this if I were you.

tGrace is so grateful, they cling to each other even harder. 
tAs the tears subside, Grace manages to admit...

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI'm sorry... about what I said. It's 
ttjust that -- all those times you 
ttand Daddy were trying for another 
ttkid, I... I used to pray at night that

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat?

tThey both start crying again as Annie rocks her gently.

<b>tttt  ANNIE

tHe stops to look out the window overlooking the Creek House.

tAnnie and Grace fell asleep with the lights still on in the

ttOperator?... I'm ready.

<b>tEXT. RIDING ARENA - LATER THAT MORNING
</b>
tAnnie and Grace are standing by the arena fence. Frank, Joe 
tand the Twins are sitting on the fence rail. Joe is holding a 
tsaddle and a bridle, standing in some shadows in an empty 
tarena. Pilgrim comes running into the ring. Out of habit, he 
tstarts circling the ring. He sees Tom holding a saddle. 
tPilgrim walks towards him. Curious, he stops, looking at him. 
tTom puts the saddle down, sitting crossways on it. Pilgrim 
twalks towards him again. He stops, looking at Tom again. Tom 
tjust sits there, playing with the bridle. Pilgrim walks 
taround him. Tom doesn't show him any interest. Pilgrim comes 
tcloser. He looks at the saddle. He runs off. He stops, 
tlooking back. Tom just sits. Pilgrim walks back over. Tom 
tstands and shows him the bridle. Pilgrim comes closer, 
tsniffing it. He rubs his nose against the leather. Tom pats 
this head. Then, in one quick, but deft motion, he puts the 
tbridle on him. Pilgrim tosses his head, but it doesn't seem 
tto bother him. Grace and Annie watch intently. Tom takes the 
treins, walking Pilgrim around the ring. He walks him to the 
tsaddle. Pilgrim paws at it with his hoof. He turns and runs 
toff. Tom lets him go. Pilgrim runs around the ring, slows 
tdown, looks over at Tom. Tom picks up the saddle. Pilgrim, 
tcautiously, comes back over. Tom, with the saddle, walks away 
tfrom him. Pilgrim, again curious, follows him. He nudges Tom. 
tTom stops. Pilgrim comes around to take a good look at the 
tsaddle. Tom rubs his back. And gently, like laying down a 
tsheet, puts the saddle on his back. Pilgrim shuffles slightly 
tat the touch. Tom quickly cinches it. Taking up the reins, he 
twalks Pilgrim around the ring again. He starts to jog. 
tPilgrim jogs with him. And in the middle of the jog, Tom 
tgrabs onto the saddle horn, and without breaking his stride, 
tpulls himself back up onto his back. He lays across the 
tsaddle, letting Pilgrim feel his weight. He sits up, and 
twithout letting him break his stride, he urges Pilgrim with 
this thighs, keeping him in the jog, riding around the ring.

tGrace and Annie cheer. Tom tips his hat to them...

<b>tINT. THE BARN - DAY
</b>
tGrace is cleaning stalls, etc... She exits one of the stalls 
twith a pail and stops -- looking down the barn to where she 
tknows Pilgrim is. She places the pail down and gathers her 
tcourage. She walks to Pilgrim's stall. She stands motionless 
tfor some moments before she opens the doors and enters...

tPilgrim steps back a bit. He looks at her. He pins his ears 
tback. Stomps his feet. Grace is about to turn and leave, but 
tshe stops herself and remains still.

tSlowly, she reaches out to touch Pilgrim's head... and he 
tlets her. We see in Grace a maturity of character, a 
twillingness to face what she must face... the beginning of a 
tcompassion, not only for Pilgrim, but perhaps for herself as 
twell.

<b>tEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - NIGHT
</b>
tA full moon lights the ranch. Tom pulls up to the ranch house 
tin his truck, parks and gets out. As he walks towards the 
thouse, he hears:

tGrace exits the Creek House and coming towards him, a coat 
tover her nightgown. Tom waits until she reaches him.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI was waiting for you to come back.

tTom instinctively knows what she wants.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou hungry?

<b>tINT. RANCH HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

tGrace sits at the table. Tom is cooking at the stove. It feels 
tas if they are the only two people on earth. Grace gets up her 
tnerve... and begins:

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttJudith was telling me about this boy 
ttshe really liked. She never even had 
tta chance to tell me his name...

tShe starts to quietly cry, but it doesn't stop her.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWe were going to go around by the

tAnd we see the accident all over again... But this time, a

tHer horse sliding back down the hill.

tGrace tries to move Pilgrim to avoid the errant horse, but 
tit's too late, the horse plows into them, the horses sliding 
tback down the hillside onto the empty COUNTRY ROAD...

</b>tt...And the truck started skidding...

tThe truck skidded on the icy road, going out of control, jack-
tknifing, heading right for them...

</b>tt...It was coming right at us... There

ttit just disappeared. And what was left 
ttwas nothing but anger... It's like the 
ttboy I knew just went away somewhere...

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI know where he goes.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI know you do. Don't you disappear.
ttt(holds her tighter)
ttYou do whatever you have to, to hold 
tton...
ttt(thinks)
ttI'll tell you one more thing... When 
ttPilgrim reared up to face that 
tttruck... you know what I think?... I 
ttthink that damn horse loved you so much, 
tthe was trying to protect you... That's 
ttwhat I think.

tGrace listens to this. As Tom holds her in silence, it's 
talmost as if they were father and daughter...

<b>tEXT. THE CORRAL - PRE-DAWN
</b>
tTom stands with Grace in the corral. Tom's horse, Rimrock, is 
tsaddled nearby. Tom takes Grace's cane.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttLet me hold that...

tGrace stands, looking at the horse...

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI can't... not yet...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttThere's no hurry. Take you time.

tShe's trying so hard to be brave. After a moment, she reaches 
tfor the saddle horn. She puts her prosthetic leg in the 
tstirrup, takes a breath and swings her leg up -- slipping, 
tfalling to the ground. Tom doesn't say anything. She pulls 
therself back up. She repeats the action... determinedly. She 
tswings her leg over again and sits squarely on the horse. Tom 
tremains still, but proud.

tAs the day breaks, we leave them in silence -- Tom standing, 
thands in pocket... Grace sitting up on the horse, proudly.

<b>tEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE, THE PASTURE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
tEndless sky. Annie is jogging off in the distance when she 
tlooks up and stops to see: Tom and Grace, both on horses, 
tstopped on a rolling hill. They do not see her.

tAnnie is filled with emotion... pride for her daughter, 
tgratitude for this amazing man.

tAs the two ride off into the distance we do a slow:

<b>tttttt FADE OUT:
</b>
<b>ttttttSHOCK CUT:
</b>
<b>tBRIGHT SUNSHINE... CATTLE DRIVE...
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - DAY
</b>
tFrank and Diane, with the Twins, dogs at their heels, ride in 
tfront of the herd. Behind them, Joe riding alongside Grace. 
tSmokey and some Hands ride among the herd, keeping them moving.

tAnd riding behind the herd are Annie and Tom...

<b>tMONTAGE OF VARIOUS MOMENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY DURING THE CATTLE 
</b>tDRIVE... Highlighting, in particular, those in which the rising 
tsexual tension between Tom and Annie is apparent.

<b>tEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - NIGHT
</b>
tThe cattle stands in silhouette. We hear singing.

tEveryone is sitting around a campfire. Frank's playing the 
tguitar, singing along with Tom. They laugh when a lyric or a 
tnote goes wrong. Everyone is enjoying it.

tAnnie, her arms around her knees, sits off by herself. The 
tsong ends and people applaud.

tFrank hands the guitar to Hank;

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttPlay that sweet one you know. The one 
ttmakes my wife here so friendly.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttt(slaps his shoulder)
ttYou!

tHank begins to play and sing a painfully pretty song. His 
tsweet voice is stark contrast to his gruff, strongman 
tappearance. Frank offers his hand to Diane, she slaps it away 
tand laughs, he helps her up and they start to dance. As 
teveryone watches...

tJoe stands and offers his hand to Grace;

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttYou wouldn't want to dance with me, 
ttwould you?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI don't thinks you'd want me tripping 
ttall over you in front of everybody.

<b>tttt  JOE
</b>ttt(sweetly)
ttI wouldn't let happen.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt(affectionately)
ttYou know, you're a good kid.

tJoe smiles and helps her up. They come together and start 
tdancing.

tAnnie is watching, holding her breath with gratitude.

tTom notices Annie off by herself and crosses to her. He 
textends his hand. She hesitates, looks again to Grace with 
tJoe, then accepts...

tHis hand slide to her back. Her hand to his shoulder. They 
tdance. Their bodies closer than they've ever been. Slowly, 
tshe leans her head against his body. And surrenders, for the 
tmoment...

tDiane sees them. She holds her husband fast, and buries her 
thead on his neck.

<b>tEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - DAY
</b>
tMORE CATTLE DRIVE MANTAGE -- Taking Tom and Annie a bit 
tfurther in their intimacy; perhaps Tom takes extra special 
tcare to explain things to Annie, or fix her saddle cinch, or 
tmake her laugh...

<b>tEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - EVENING
</b>
tThe cows stands in the pasture, grazing. Annie and Diane are 
tcleaning some pots and pans in the stream.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttMust be nice for you to take a few 
ttdays off from your work, huh?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWell, I have more than a few days, ha, 
ttha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an 
tteditor anymore... right now... First 
tttime I've said it out loud.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttThey fired you?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttNo, it's more like a leave of-
ttt(stops)
ttHa, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttYou don't seem to upset?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDelayed shock. Or maybe not. I know 
ttI could talk my way back if I wanted 
ttor... go to another magazine, 
ttsomeplace... Just not sure if I want 
ttto.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttGuess you don't have to figure it out 
ttuntil you go home.

tThis phrase "go home" stings Annie -- though Diane said it 
tinnocently.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttDid you always know this was the life 
ttyou wanted?

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttI fell in love. After that, I never 
ttthought about being anything but a 
ttrancher's wife. I never saw it like I 
ttwas losing some other life, just felt 
ttlike I was gaining one. I know that's 
ttnot a popular opinion nowadays and I 
ttain't saying it's the right one. We 
ttall have to find the life meant for us.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttFrank's a good man.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttThey don't come better. But I don't 
ttdeny there are times I wonder about 
ttthings I won't have. Maybe one day I'll 
ttget to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know 
ttif you try too many different lives, 
ttyou can wind up with no life at all...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttSounds like something Tom would say.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttYes, it does.

tAnnie and Diane resume washing the dishes in silence. Annie 
tdeep in thought. Until Diane stops. After a beat, Annie 
tnotices.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttAnnie, I'm not good at this kind of talk 
tt-- goes round and round a thing but 
ttnever comes to it -- so let's just say 
ttwhat it is. When you first came here, 
ttI didn't like you and I was worried. Tom 
ttmeans a lot to me and this family. Don't 
ttgo looking here for whatever you looking 
ttfor. Don't make that man go through 
ttsomething it took him a long time to see 
tthis way clear out of the first time.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI don't think anybody can make Tom do 
ttanything he didn't want.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttHe's a good man, Tom is. He's got a 
ttgift, come from heaven above, I swear. 
ttBut he's still a man. And a woman can 
ttlead a man into the middle of a mountain 
ttlake -- and still make him think he's on 
ttdry land.

tDiane's words ring in Annie's head.

<b>tEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - DEAD OF NIGHT
</b>
tDead in stillness. The cattle dark and motionless. Everyone 
tasleep in bedrolls around the pasture.

tAnnie awakens, looks up at the moon, watching it go in and 
tout of the clouds. She looks over to sleeping Grace... Then 
tlooks to where Tom is -- and sees his sleeping bag is empty. 
tQuietly, she rises and looks for him.

tShe starts across the grass and sees him crossing on his 
thaunches, wearing a slicker, sitting in the grass by the 
tstream, drinking some water. She watches him.

tTom senses something and turns. For a moment, they just look 
tat each other -- half disbelieving the inevitable is so close 
tat hand. Annie approaches as Tom rises.

tThey meet. They kiss. Tentative at first, but more, just to 
tmake that very, precious first moment of discovery last as 
tlong as it can. The kiss grows more passionate. They begin to 
tlose themselves in each other.

tUntil, suddenly, aware of their surroundings, they part. No 
twords. Their expressions to each other tell all. Annie 
tseparates herself and goes back to her bedroll... Tom stands 
tin the grass, by the stream... the moving water, the night's 
tonly sound.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:

tThe cattle drive returns. Tom, Annie, Grace, et al... are on 
ttheir horses, heading back towards the ranch when Grace sees 
tin the distance;

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttDad?

tAnnie looks up and sees:

tPOV -- ROBERT has come to the ranch. He is waiting for them 
twith his luggage beside a rental car... standing out like an 
tLike The Man In The Gray Flannel Suit in the middle of 
tWyeth's "Christina's World."

<b>tEXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tEveryone is being introduced to Robert, as Grace hugs him 
tfrom the side, never letting go of him. Frank, Diane -- who 
tintroduce their kids, then Tom and Robert shake hands...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThis is Mr. Booker, Robert.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(extends hand)
ttTom.

</b>ttHi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful 
ttfor the way you took in my girls here.

</b>ttOh yeah...

tLaugh. Awkward silence...

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttWell I uh... I can already see a change.
ttt(hugging Grace)
ttAnd I'm very grateful to you.

tRobert is so sincere -- in that openly, modern, "express your 
tfeelings" kind of way. Tom just nods.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttDid you notice -- no cane?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI know. Amazing.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttCan we show him Pilgrim, Tom?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttOh, we're gonna show your dad plenty. 
ttWhy don't you all get settled in and 
ttwe'll do the tour. Excuse me.

tAs Tom walks away, a nervous Robert feels compelled to say:

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttSee you later!

tTom just nods and keeps walking. Annie and Robert face each 
tother for a beat.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttLet's bring your bags inside.

</b>ttWait till you see this -- we have the 
ttwhole house to ourselves...

tThe MacLean walk to the Creek House.

<b>tEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY
</b>
tIn the distance, we see the pick-up truck parked out in the 
tpasture. Tom is standing with Robert -- in jeans, now -- and 
tGrace, telling Robert about the ranch. Robert has his arms 
taround Grace, asking questions, interested in everything... 
tGrace is loving being with her two favorite men...

<b>tEXT. RANCH - DAY
</b>
tGrace waits in the truck as Tom leads Robert through the cows 
tand cowshit, climbs up and hops over a wood fence. Robert 
tfollows suit -- not as gracefully -- and gets a splinter...

</b>ttIs there anything you need? I'm going

</b>ttWell, I am going to go after lunch.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttNo, no, I'll go -- just give me a

tAnnie is determined. She needs to be by herself for a bit.

<b>tEXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RANCH - DAY
</b>
tTom continues his tour as the dogs run about them. Tom pays 
tthe dogs no attention, except to bark an order. Robert, 
thowever, engages with them -- picking up a stick and throws 
tit. A dog returns and gives it back. Robert kneels and begins 
trubbing the dog's fur, talking to it, looking like an 
tanachronism in his baggy jeans with designer cowboy belt and 
tspanking new designer cowboy boots.

tTom waits patiently for Robert, who... and carries on with 
tthe dog a bit too long. When Robert gets up, he habitually 
tbrushes the dirt off his jeans, maybe even his boots, and 
tmakes sure his outfit is hanging properly.

<b>tINT. BARN - DAY
</b>
tGrace is in the stall with Pilgrim. Once again, close enough 
tto touch him, which he allows.

tOutside the stall, stand Robert and Tom. Robert squeezes his 
tsplinter...

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI can't believe it's the same horse.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttWe still have a way to go.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttHow much longer do you think?

tTom understands this man wants his family back.

ttelling Robert:

</b>ttWe thought we lost him in the snow 
ttstorm... Told the kids. Had a funeral 
ttfor the damn thing. Finally, snow 
ttstops. Staring to warm up. I go out

tLaughter all around.

</b>
tEveryone is outside enjoying the night after a long day.

tDiane and Annie are on the porch. Diane is showing Annie how 
tshe does her needlepoint. Annie is genuinely interested.

tTom and Frank and Robert are sitting out front. Grace is at 
tRobert's feet. Joe sits on the ground in front of his father, 
topposite Grace.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttIs the poverty worse, now, you 
ttthink?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI haven't been back in over twenty 
ttyears, but I wouldn't be surprised. 
ttThe population's larger.

</b>ttWhat were you doing over in India?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttUh, this was right after college. I 
ttwas in the Peace Corps.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttThat right?

tBack on Diane and Annie, who hear the laughter O.S. and look. 
tDiane smiles, seeing how much Grace is enjoying her dad.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttShe sure loves her daddy, huh?

tAnnie smiles and looks herself. Yes, she does, she thinks. Why 
tcan't I?

tBack to the others. Everyone is very interested in Robert's 
tstories... especially Tom.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>tt... and I thought before I settled 
ttinto law school -- everybody knew that 
ttwas the plan -- I'd take this time for 
ttmyself.

tGrace rises to go to the Creek House.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttAnd I tell you, Frank, it was one of 
ttthe --

tAs Grace passes by, she stumbles a bit and Robert habitually 
trises to help, but Grace ignores him and rights herself, 
tcontinuing. Robert quickly sits back down, continuing.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>tt... one of the uh... greatest times 
ttof my life... I had experiences that, 
ttI think, changed my outlook forever. 
ttI came back a different person, 
ttliterally.

tBack to Diane and Annie, who watch as Joe follows Grace.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttI think I'm going to have my hands 
ttfull with the son of mine when you 
ttleave. Just might be his first 
ttbroken heart.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh, how sweet.

tA burst of laughter pulls their attention to the group -- 
tRobert is now standing, acting out a story.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>tt... and I have no idea what he's 
ttsaying because I don't understand 
ttHindu...

tEveryone is listening, with big expectant smiles. Annie 
twatches -- having heard this story before. Her eyes gradually 
tshift to Tom, who is enjoying the story.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>tt... So, finally I'm trying to explain 
ttto him that I'm allergic to wool and 
ttwould he please get his sheep out of 
ttmy car --

tLaughter. Robert continues, giving a quick look to Annie -- 
twho is looking at Tom... Robert lets it go, continuing his 
tstory.

<b>tINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tGrace is asleep. Robert sits by her bed, lit by the moon 
tthrough a window. He stares at this creature he loves so 
tmuch. He rises and enters Annie's room.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttTired?

tAnnie shrugs. Robert looks at the bed. He teases.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttSmall bed. Maybe I should sleep in

</b>ttt(teases back)
ttYou're allergic to hay.

ttI apologize for the surprise, but the

</b>ttYou don't have to explain. You have 
ttevery right to come.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI can see why you put your faith in

ttGood at what he does. That's rare.

tAnnie nods. She tries to hide her discomfort. Robert sits on 
tthe bed before her.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttYou were right about coming here. I'm 
ttsorry for not thinking...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttNo, it's okay. Believe me, there were 
ttplenty of times I didn't know what 
ttthe hell was right.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttHow are you feeling about work?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttLet's not talk about that now.

tAnd they're quiet. He moves to kiss her. It's awkward. They 
tlook to each other -- as they try to remember how to make love 
ttogether...

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI feel like I'm on a first date.

tAnnie smiles sympathetically.

<b>tEXT. BARN DANCE, HANK'S RANCH - DUSK
</b>
tCars and pick-up trucks haphazardly parked along a dirt 
troad... Smoking open grill barbecues. Ranchers and families 
tmove about the ranch, sit and eat at picnic tables with 
tgingham tablecloths... Some teenagers hanging around the 
tcorral, talking. Diane and some other women, eating and 
ttalking... Frank with a group of men, drinking beer, telling 
tstories.

tA BAND has been set up by the barn. People are dancing under 
tthe harvest moon. Grace is dancing with Joe... Tom is dancing 
twith a local woman... Annie with a rancher... Everyone is 
thaving a good time...

tRobert is enjoying a smoke with some men. He looks over to 
tthe dance floor and smiles when he sees Grace and Joe.

tJoe and the Rancher trade place... Joe dances with Annie, the 
tRancher with Grace... But Tom sees his chance and switches 
twith the Rancher so that he can dance with Grace... She is 
tthrilled and he guides her effortlessly across the floor.

tJoe and Annie are interrupted by another couple. Joe switches 
tpartners, but Annie smiles and excuses herself -- she wants to 
trest.

tRobert continues talking with some of the men. He puts out 
this smoke and looks over to the dance floor. He sees Grace now 
tdancing with Tom... His eyes search for Annie. He moves away 
tfrom the men until he sees, from a distance;

tAnnie, sitting by herself, amidst the crowd... No one would 
tnotice her unless they were looking for her... But Robert does 
t-- and what he sees is Annie looking at Grace and Tom... then, 
tonly looking at Tom... Smiling to herself gently... Watching 
this every move. Suddenly, she rises and exits out of the barn 
tto get some air.

<b>tEXT. HANK'S RANCH - NIGHT
</b>
tAnnie finds an isolated spot, behind the main house, to be by 
therself and catch her breath.

<b>tINT. BARN - NIGHT
</b>
tTom and Grace continue dancing. She's in heaven. Robert 
tapproaches and Tom quickly allows him to take over. Grace 
tloves the attention from both men. As they dance off, Tom 
tcrosses the dance floor and is met by Hank's wife;

<b>tttt  HANK'S WIFE
</b>ttOh Tom, would you check the shed and see 
ttif there's anymore chairs.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttSure.

<b>tEXT. HANK'S RANCH - NIGHT
</b>
tTom is walking along when he turns the corner of Hank's house 
tand finds;

tAnnie sitting alone, staring up at the night. They see each 
tother. From behind the house, no one else can see them.

tIt is as if the fates brought them face to face and alone. 
tWithout any will to stop it, they embrace and kiss 
tpassionately. But when they look into each other's eyes, 
tthere is no joy in the kiss. Tom releases her and walks away, 
theading for the shed. Annie quickly pulls herself together 
tand enters the main house through the back door.

<b>tINT. DOUBLE DIVIDE RANCH, KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
tDiane is once more sitting at the kitchen table, looking over 
tsome bills before bed. Her tape player is on softly. Tom 
tenters and crosses to the sink to get a glass of water.

tDiane looks up, seeing Tom with his back to her -- standing at 
tthe sink, filling his glass -- staring out the window over the 
tsink. She looks to the dish of brownies on the table.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttI have some brownies left over. Want 
ttone?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(w/o turning around)
ttNo thanks.

tDiane senses an uneasiness in Tom. She looks as he drinks his 
twater.

tMEDIUM CLOSE-UP ON TOM'S BACK, as if from Diane's POV.

tBut when we pull back we find ourselves;

<b>tINT. BARN - NIGHT
</b>
tTom is standing in front of Pilgrim's stall. He opens the 
tdoor. They look at each other. He strokes him and begins to 
twhisper;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttThere's something you have to do 
tttomorrow, boy...

tCamera gently moves away... and Tom whispers to Pilgrim what 
tmust be done...

<b>tEXT. THE RIDING ARENA - DAY
</b>
tThere's a stillness. A sense of import. Annie, Robert, Frank, 
tDiane, Joe and Smokey, are all at various spots along the fence.

tGrace stands inside the ring. Tom is standing beside Pilgrim 
tin the middle of the ring. Pilgrim is bridled and saddled. 
tTom adjusts he stirrup. He walks over to Grace...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttAll set?

tGrace swallows hard, nodding. She's worried...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttSure?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttt(softly)
ttSure.

tTom puts his arms around her shoulders and walks out to 
tPilgrim. The horse pricks up his ears as they approach. Tom 
tmotions Grace to stop a short distance from Pilgrim so as not 
tto crowd him. Tom walks over alone, reaching to gently take 
thold of him. Holding him by the bridle, he puts his head 
tbeside Pilgrim's, quietly speaking to him, soothing Pilgrim's 
tneck with his other hand...

tAnnie and Robert are fascinated. Anxious.

tPilgrim never takes his eyes off Grace. Tom tries to ease him 
tforward. Pilgrim resists, lifting his head and looking at 
tGrace so you can see the white at the top of his eye. Tom 
tturns him away, walking him in circles, trying to calm him. 
tHe leads him back to Grace. Pilgrim tosses his head and 
tstomps his feet.

tRobert grows more anxious. Annie is calmer, more focused.

tTom climbs up on him, riding him around the arena in an easy 
tlope. Grace watches them go round the ring. She looks at her 
tparents and tries to smile. They try as well.

tTom dismounts and leads Pilgrim back to Grace. Pilgrim balks 
tagain, violently throwing his head, kicking... Grace's 
tshoulders slump, she presses her hands in her pockets, 
tfighting not to cry...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttSmokey...

tSmokey climbs over the rail into the ring as Tom says something 
tto him. Meanwhile Frank reassures Grace:

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttHe'll be okay, Grace. Just you hang 
tton there a minute or two. Tom'll get 
tthim, okay, you'll see...

tSmokey jogs over to the gate, climbing it, and disappearing 
tinto the barn. Tom crosses to Grace.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttThere's still something going on 
ttinside of him I can't reach. So me 
ttand Smokey here, we're going to 
tttry laying him down. Okay?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhat does that mean?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttIt's more or less how it sounds. 
ttSometimes it's not pretty to watch. 
ttSome horses fight it real hard. 
ttYour fella's already shown us he 
ttlikes a good fight. So if you don't 
ttwant to watch, I'll call you when it's 
ttdone.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI want to watch.

tSmokey re-enters the ring, carrying some rope. He talks 
tbriefly to Tom. Pilgrim, sensing something, turns and runs to 
tthe far side of the ring. Tom, his arms spread, walks over 
tto him, keeping him by the fence. Tom takes him by the 
tbridle. Smokey comes beside him. Tom unhitches the bridle and 
tin its place slips a rope halter Smokey passes to him. 
tSmokey then hands him two long ropes, one at a time. Tom 
tfastens one under the halter and ties the other to the saddle 
thorn. Tom asks Smokey.

</b>ttYou got that soft rope?

tSmokey hands it to him. Tom quietly talks to Pilgrim, runs 
this hand down Pilgrim's left foreleg and lifts his hoof. 
tPilgrim slightly shifts. And when he's still, Tom slips the 
tloop at the end of the soft rope over the hoof making sure 
tit's snug. And taking the other end of the rope, he hoists the 
tweight of Pilgrim's raised hoof and ties the rope to the 
tsaddle horn. Pilgrim stands on three legs -- an explosion 
twaiting to happen. Tom moves away from Pilgrim, taking the 
thalter line from Smokey. Pilgrim, trying to move, finds he's 
tcrippled. Scared, he lurches, hopping on his right foreleg. 
tSeeing he can't walk, panicked, he tries to run. Tom and 
tSmokey, brace themselves, lean back on their ropes and force 
thim around them in a tight circle. He goes around and around 
tlike a crazed rocking horse with a broken leg. Tom looks over 
tand sees Annie has left Robert outside the ring to stand by 
tan anguished Grace -- her hands on her shoulders, gripping 
ther. Robert watches, feeling too much a foreigner...

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttWhat is he doing this?

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttIt'll be OK, Grace.

tBut even Frank isn't so sure. Pilgrim, covered in sweat, 
tstill circles. As he runs, his hobbled foot jabs at the air, 
ttrying to find peace. He runs and runs as Tom and Smokey lean 
ton the ropes -- until he can't run any more and stops. Tom and 
tSmokey let the lines go slack. Pilgrim, stands there, his wet 
tsides heaving, panting like an asthmatic, making loud rasping 
tsounds. Tom and Smokey speak. Smokey hands him his rope. 
tTurning, he gets a coiled lasso out of the sand. He swings 
tthe rope in a wide loop and makes it fall over Pilgrim's 
tsaddle horn. He pulls it tight. And he takes the other end of 
tthe rope to the far side of the fence and ties it in a quick 
trelease knot to the bottom rung. Coming back he takes the 
tother two lines from Tom. Tom crosses to the rail. He starts 
tputting pressure on the rope. Pilgrim feeing it, braces 
thimself. The pressure tilts the saddle hold downward.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttt(to Grace and Annie)
ttHe's trying to get him to go down 
tton his knees...

tPilgrim fights. Tom pulls on the rope. Pilgrim, slowly, 
tbegrudgingly, gives ground. Tom, brings him to his knees, 
tbut it is short lived. Pilgrim is muscling his way back to 
this feet. Tom pulls him down to his knees again. Pilgrim, 
tfighting with every bit of strength, slowly gets to his feet 
tagain. But the pressure Tom is putting on the saddle is too 
tstrong and relentless and finally Pilgrim goes down on his 
tknees and stays down. Yet Tom keeps the pressure on... Tom 
tshouts to Smokey.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttDrop the lines and come help me...

tSmokey, dropping the line, runs over. They both pull on 
tthe saddle rope.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttThat's enough! Stop it!

tPilgrim snorts and foams at the mouth, fighting. But 
tslowly, like a wounded bird, she starts giving in. He 
trolls over on his side and lays his head in the sand and 
tis still. It seems like a total, humiliating surrender. 
tGrace starts to sob, burying her face in Annie's chest. 
tRobert feels impotent to help.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b><b>ttGRACE!
</b>
tTom and Smokey stand over the fallen horse like two big 
tgame hunters at the carcass of a kill.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttGRACE! Will you come here, please!

tGrace shakes her head "NO." Frank motions to Annie for 
ther to let Grace go... to let stand alone... We see 
tthat it's not easy for Annie to trust this, but she does. 
tAnd she steps back to where Robert stands...

tTom, his face set, walks toward Grace...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttGrace, I need you to come with me.

tGrace violently shakes her head "NO"... Robert gets up the 
tcourage to say aloud:

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttWell maybe she shouldn't be here...

tAnnie quickly turns to him and says with quick intensity:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttRobert! Let him handle it! Please!

tRobert can't watch this. He turns and takes a few steps. 
tJust stops... standing behind and apart from Annie, to 
tjust watch... slowly becoming transfixed, like someone 
twho can't stop staring at an accident.

tTom reaches Grace and puts his hand tenderly on her shoulder...

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttGrace, I need you to come with me.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttNo, you're only going to hurt him 
ttsome more.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttHe's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>tt  t(turned away)
ttNo!

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttGrace, Listen... you've got to do this. 
ttJust trust me one more time.

tGrace looks into his eyes and is reminded of all this man 
thas done for her... and she remembers her trust.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttDo what?

tTom, prouder of her now than ever before.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI'll show you.

tTom leads her across the ring, with his arm around her 
tshoulder. Annie tries to maintain her composure. Robert 
tremains still and focused.

tTom and Grace come to Pilgrim, lying in the dirt, his 
tbreathing plaintive. Tom speaks gently;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI want you to lay down with him. I 
ttwant you to stroke him. I want to 
ttstart with his hindquarters and rub 
tthim, feel him all over.

tGrace is shaking her head "NO." He speaks more firmly.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttGrace, you've got to do what I say.

tGrace knows there's no way out. She takes a breath and slowly 
tkneels in the dirt beside him, with Tom's help. She lays on 
thim, rubbing him, his hindquarters, his legs, his side, 
tsoftly rubbing his neck and the wet silky side of his head.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttNow, listen. I want you to stand on 
tthim.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat?!

tTom responds to their voice without looking at them:

<b>tttt  TOM
</b><b>ttPLEASE!
</b>ttt(they stop)
ttGrace, do what I'm telling you. Stand 
tton him... now!

tGrace obeys him through her tears. She lets Tom take her hand 
tand guide her up onto the curve of Pilgrim's belly. Then he 
tlets go. Grace stands there with teas steaming down her 
tface -- standing on the animal she loved most in the world.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIt's so cruel.

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttNo. He had the choice.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat choice!!?

<b>tttt  FRANK
</b>ttEither fight the way things are or 
ttaccept it.

tRobert, however, is hypnotized by the event. He is having a 
tprivate epiphany of sorts.

tGrace sits in the dirt by Pilgrim and strokes him quietly -- 
tshe begins talking to him, the way Tom does. Tom watches, as 
the cautiously steps further away. Pilgrim looks up at Grace 
tout of the dark pool of his one sad eye. They look at each 
tother. And we understand there's a connection once more. A 
tmoment of understanding... and forgiveness.

tGrace starts to untie his ropes. Smokey is about to stop her 
tbut Tom shakes "NO"...

tPilgrim, like an infant coming out of the water, breathing 
tlife for the first time, gets to his feet. Grace and him look 
tto each other. And all is still.

tGrace grabs the saddle horn. Pilgrim shuffles as if he's 
tgoing to bolt. Grace quietly reassures him... She then 
tcarefully puts her prosthetic leg in the stirrup. Pilgrim 
tshifts slightly. Annie covers her mouth so as not to scream 
tout her fear. Robert breaths heavily. They watch as Grace 
tswings her leg, determined, and pulls herself into the 
tsaddle. Sitting on his back, Pilgrim tosses his head and 
tlooks as he's going to run off. But Grace puts her arms 
taround his neck, and once again, quietly reassures him.

tShe starts to ride him, slowly, her arms around his neck, 
ttalking all the while, around the ring.

tAnnie laughs as she cries -- emotion overwhelming her. Robert 
tfeels almost numb with fascination, gratitude, confusion...

tThe slow ride turns into a trot... then a lope... then a 
tcanter... round and round the ring. Frank and Diane smile. 
tDiane looks to Tom and knows what he's feeling...

tTom watches as any father would -- his heart pounding with 
tpride for the miracle of his child. But he doesn't let on for 
ta second.

tGrace brings Pilgrim to a stop, lifts her arms to the 
theavens, victorious. Everyone cheers. Smokey helps her off 
tthe horse. She stops to look at Tom, who busies himself with 
tpicking up the ropes... So she re-focuses on her parents. They 
trun to each other and embrace... First, she and Annie... then, 
tshe and her father...

tBut, as Robert and Grace hold each other and begins to exit, 
tAnnie manages to make eye contact with Tom... and tell him 
twith one look, how grateful she is... and how much she loves 
thim. And he receives it...

<b>tEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY
</b>
<b>tWE FOLLOW THE DAYS AFTER THIS EVENT...
</b>
tWork on the ranch goes on as usual while Tom and Grace keep 
tnurturing Pilgrim back to life.

<b>tEXT. PASTURE - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
tGrace and Annie go riding...

<b>tEXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY
</b>
tRobert takes an isolated hike up the mountain until he comes 
tupon a ridge overlooking an inspiring vista. We can tell 
tRobert is moved by the sight. Sweaty, tired, he find a place 
tto sit... to be still... and to consider his life.

<b>tEXT. THE RANCH HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tFrank's car is parked up for the trip to the airport that 
twill take the Bookers to Branton, Missouri for Diane's 
tcousin's wedding...

tGrace, Annie and Robert are outside saying goodbye to the 
tBookers; Diane, the Twins... and Joe... Joe awkwardly shakes 
ther hand... then removes his hat and puts it on her head. 
tEveryone laughs. They want to hug each other, but don't know 
tif they would...

tFrank and Tom are packing the car...

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttOh Frank, don't forget the wedding

ttt(to Robert and Annie)
ttI got her a pasta maker from the

ttWell, it was nice to meet you, Mr.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttSame here, Mrs. Booker. Thank you 
ttagain for all your kindness.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttAh...

tDiane turns to Annie. Robert instinctively steps away, saying 
tgoodbye to Joe and the boys... The two women look at each 
tother with respect and concern.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttNow, are you sure you want to drive 
ttthat horse back yourself? There are 
ttplenty of people 'round here who do 
ttthat sort of thing.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI already know the way... and it's 
ttnot like I have a job I have to rush 
tthome for.

ttBetween you and me, I could use the

tDiane understands.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttAnd you'll be all right by yourself 
tthere,
ttt(referring to Robert and Grace)
ttafter they've gone?

tTom hears this bit of info as he passes by with the wedding 
tpresent and puts it in the truck. Annie makes sure to avert 
ther look.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttIt's just one night. If I get 
ttuncomfortable, I'll go over to 
ttHanks.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttt(double meaning)

</b>ttPromise.

tDiane just nods, knowingly. She extends her hand. The women 
tshake.

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>  ttGood luck to you, Annie.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou too, Diane.

tThey part. Diane starts giving order as she gets in the car:

<b>tttt  DIANE
</b>ttAll right, everybody in. Frank, we 
ttall set...

tCamera wides as we hear the voices of departure... see the 
tMacLeans waving... See Tom off by himself, waving... but 
tthinking of something else...

<b>tINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tIn the midst of packing, Annie has made dinner for Grace and 
tRobert. In the midst of eating, Robert asks:

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttShouldn't we have invited Tom over?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI did. He said he had work to do 
ttuntil late.

tAnnie remains silent.

<b>tEXT. RANCH HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
tTom exits with a small, leather satchel. He crosses to his 
ttruck, tosses in the satchel, gets in and drives off.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. BARN - MORNING
</b>
tGrace enters the barn to say goodbye to Pilgrim.

<b>tINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tShe moves to his stall and opens the doors. He stands there, 
twithout any fear of her. She smiles and enters. She wraps her 
tarm around his neck, pets him and whispers.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttI'll see you home... OK?

<b>tINT. CREEK HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tEverything is being packed up. Robert is dressed for travel. 
tAnnie is taping up the boxes containing her computer 
tequipment.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttAre you going to stay in the city or 
ttgo up to Connecticut?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttConnecticut. I told the office I'd 
ttwork out of there next week. When are 
ttyou planning to start back?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttProbably first thing in the morning. 
ttIt's too late to start now. I'm going 
ttto try not to do too much driving in 
ttthe dark.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttMay I have a suggestion?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYeah, what?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttTake your time.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(innocently)
ttWhat do you mean?

tAnnie looks up from the box to see Robert is calmly staring 
tat her. His demeanor is different. Something's going on.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttYou look like something's wrong.

tThis is Robert's moment. He knows it. He takes a breath and 
thopes it comes out right:

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttI'll tell you something, Annie -- I 
ttstood there looking at what was 
tthappening to that horse... And, I 
ttswear, it felt like the same thing 
ttwas happening to me.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI don't understa-

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>tt  t(continues)
ttAnd I have two choices. I can either 
ttfight the way things are, or accept 
ttthem.
ttt(Annie waits; he smiles)
ttSee, I always knew I loved you more. 
ttDidn't bother me. I always felt 
ttlucky... a little amazed... that such 
tta vibrant, beautiful woman would want 
ttto be with a man like me... And I 
ttguess I thought as long as I did 
tteverything right -- if I was the best 
tthusband I could be, the best father... 
tteven being a good lawyer only mattered 
ttto me because of what it meant for 
ttus... if I could do all that, it 
ttwouldn't make any difference if we 
ttloved each other the same or not... 
ttI wasn't asking for more. I told myself 
ttI didn't need more.
ttt(smiles)
ttBut you don't know how you feel about 
ttme. You don't know... if you want a 
ttlife with me anymore...
ttt(bravely)
ttAnd I don't want you to come home 
ttuntil you do know...
ttt(the hard part)
tt... one way or the other.

tAnnie cannot remember a time when she ever loved her husband 
tmore than in this moment -- knowing what it took for him to 
tsay this. She would not disrespect it with denials. Her 
tthroat is choked with tears, she swallows down. She nods.

tRobert nods, feeling both pride and heartbreak in the same 
tmoment. He picks up his bag, kisses her goodbye and exits.

<b>tEXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tAnnie and Robert walk towards the car to find Grace, leaning 
tagainst it -- looking depressed.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat's the matter, honey? Gonna miss 
ttPilgrim?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttTom's gone.

tBoth Robert and Annie are surprised.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttSmokey told me he left last night to 
ttlook at some horses in Sheriden. He 
ttwon't be back for three days. I can't 
ttbelieve he didn't want to say goodbye.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(hiding her own distress)
ttWell... honey... you know... that's 
ttjust not his way. Maybe you can write 
tthim a letter or something. Say thank 
ttyou... Don't think about it... You 
tttake care and I'll see you home.

tShe embraces Grace and, over her shoulder, watches Robert 
tenter the car. Grace follows suit. The car drives off leaving 
tAnnie alone at the Double Divide.

<b>tEXT. CREEK HOUSE - DUSK
</b>
tThe ranch is still. Annie stands on the porch, her arms 
tfolded, vulnerable, looking at the ranch. All her boxes are 
tpacked and stacked in the room. She looks over to the Ranch 
tHouse... to Tom's window.

<b>tINT. TOM'S ROOM - DUSK
</b>
tA light goes on. Annie enters, cautiously. She's never been 
tin this room. She crosses to the desk, touches it. She 
tnotices a tape player and pushes it on. MUSIC PLAYS... She 
tsees a small framed photo -- of Tom's son, years ago.

tSuddenly, she feels like an intruder. She shuts the music off 
tand exits...

<b>tINT. BARN - DUSK
</b>
tAnnie faces Pilgrim... she gently lifts her hand and caresses 
this face. He returns her gentleness. Annie is remembering 
tRobert's words, her heart is heavy with conflict. She jokes:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhy do I get the feeling you know 
ttwhat I should do, but you're not 
tttelling me?

tShe hears a truck pull up... Then, a door open and close. Her 
theart races...

<b>tEXT. BARN - DUSK
</b>
tAnnie exits the barn and sees:

tTom, walking away from the truck with the headlights left 
ton... is walking right towards her.

tAnnie begins moving towards him, When they meet:

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI won't apologize for this. And I 
ttwon't hide it. Not for anybody.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI won't ask you to.

tHe takes her in his arms and they kiss.

<b>tEXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tTom leads Annie to the front door. She waits as he unlocks it.

<b>tINT. RANCH HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR, TOM'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tTom leads her to his room. Annie cups his grasp on her with 
tboth hands. He opens the door for her, ushers her in, then 
tcloses the door. He hangs his hat. She turns to him. They 
tembrace, surrendering to each other's passions.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. RANCH - DAWN
</b>
tCamera pas from Tom's window, bright with dawn, past his 
tdesk upon which his classical music is playing, over to the 
ttwo lovers in bed, kissing and embracing. Then:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh, God, what are we going to do? 
ttI'm supposed to --

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttSsshhh...
ttt(she stops)
ttStand still, Annie. Takes what we've 
ttgot, just for now. Can you do that?

tBeat. She nods. The permission Tom is giving her acts like a 
tgreat burden being lifted, and for the time being, she 
tsurrenders and accepts the gift of what they feel. They kiss.

<b>tEXT. THE RANCH - DAY

tSince the ranch must continue, Tom and Annie move through a

</b>
tTom and Annie, their horses packed with gear, ride across the 
thigh mountain pasture through the grazing cattle...

<b>tEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - DAY
</b>
tAnnie and Tom sit overlooking a breathtaking view. Tom is 
tshowing her the rope trick... She looks down at their touching 
tfingers and he gently pulls the rope away, still knotted, and 
twithout ever breaking their touch... Annie looks into his 
teyes, understanding what this means, raises his hand to her 
tmouth and kisses it. She looks up at him with a curious 
texpression;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttShow me again.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttAnnie!

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOne more time.

<b>tEXT. THE MOUNTAINS - DUSK
</b>
tAnnie lays asleep in Tom's arms, under a blanket. He picks up 
tanother blanket with his free hand and shimmies it under her 
thead, laying her down. She snuggles with the blanket and 
tkeeps sleeping.

tTom takes a moment to look at her as she sleeps, gently 
tbrushing her hair away from her eyes. He's deeply in love 
twith this woman and wants to keep her with him. But there is 
ta sad resignation in his look. A confusion.

tHe rises and walks to a stream nearby. He bends down to take 
tsome water when he hears something. He looks up and sees on 
tthe other side:

tA WILD HORSE giving birth to a foal in the tall grass. And a 
tWHITE STALLION steps in between Tom and the mare, as if 
tprotecting her.

tTom rises slowly to his feet. Then stands stock still. He and 
tthe Stallion penetrate each other.

tSuddenly this beautiful, powerful Stallion rears -- violently. 
tTom remains still, but clearly the horse is treating him as 
tan invader...

tIt's as if the Whisperer is now being guided by the Horse 
ttowards understanding. As Tom receives it, he remembers;

<b>tttt  TOM (V.O.)
</b>ttSummers are short here, Annie. There 
ttisn't much of a fall. Before you know 
ttit, the roads are closed... the nights 
ttget long.

</b>
<b>tttt  ANNIE (V.O.)
</b>ttI don't care! We'd be together.

<b>tttt  TOM (V.O.)
</b>ttTwo people can't just be alone together 
ttin the world. At least not us...

<b>tttt  ANNIE (V.O.)
</b>ttI can't do this. I can't leave you...

tVoice-Overs have carried over into a...

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:

<b>tINT. CREEK HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tTom and Annie make love...

<b>tttt  ANNIE (V.O.)
</b>ttI won't.

tBut there is a difference in their lovemaking. There's a 
tslowness, a reverence... a sense of two people so bounded, that 
tthey are outside of time... Their love is so strong it almost 
tfeels like despair -- their need to connect has gone beyond 
ttheir bodies and into their spirits, for which there is no 
tearthly satisfaction.

<b>tEXT. CREEK HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
tThe sun has risen.

<b>tINT. CREEK HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
tAnnie awakens in bed and discovers she is alone. She looks 
taround for Tom. She rises and enters the other room to 
tdiscover:

tAll her boxes and all her luggage have been removed.

tHer heart sinks. Tom re-enters, fully dressed, to get the 
tlast box. He sees on her face a look of confusion and hurt.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttI figured, whenever you decided to 
ttgo, you'd be all set.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(curt)
ttHow thoughtful of you. And what if 
ttI decide not to go?

tTom doesn't know how to respond. He looks away and bends down 
tto reach for the box when Annie commands:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttLeave me alone!

tBeat. They stand awkwardly for a moment, until;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(pleadingly)
ttAnnie, please...

tTom reaches to embrace her, but Annie attacks him. Punching 
this chest... pulling at his shirt as Tom tries to put his 
tarms around her...

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b><b>ttNO!... NO!... YOU DON'T DECIDE 
</b><b>ttTHIS!... NO!...
</b>
tTom's heart is breaking as he manages to get his arms around 
ther and hold her... as she breaks down and softly, the rage 
tpasses... Annie speaks softly.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(struggling)
ttI don't know any other way, Annie.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(more adamant)
ttWhy?

tSuddenly;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttYou think this is easy for me!?

tAnnie is struck by the powerful sincerity of his words;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttIt's just happened this way sometimes. 
ttI can't explain it. But I look at you 
ttand see Grace and I see Robert, and 
ttno matter what you decide about him, 
ttI just know this is right. Your life 
ttisn't here and you know it.

tAnnie looks into his eyes and asks, softly defiant;

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttThen what have we been doing? I mean 
ttwhat was the point?

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttt(confused by her question)
ttThe point was to love each other.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhy?

tAs if there has to be a result... Tom looks at her and says 
twith an almost innocent conviction:

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttBecause we had to... And I'll never 
ttstop loving you, Annie. Here. Where 
ttmy life is.

tThe simplicity, and truth, of it hits Annie strongly.

tAnnie releases herself from him and turns away... despondent. 
tRealizing the utter truth and inevitability of what he says. 
tShe starts shaking her head. Tom can't hear it... He reaches 
tfor her;

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttAnnie...

tShe turns back into his arms and they kiss passionately... 
tholding each other... as if for the last time.

<b>tEXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tTom is escorting Pilgrim into the trailer attached to the 
tSuburban. He looks across the ranch to see the figure of 
tAnnie, standing alone, perfectly still, in the pasture, 
tlooking out to the horizon... (reminiscent of Tom earlier in 
tthe film)

<b>tEXT. THE PASTURE - DAY
</b>
tTom approaches Annie from behind, stopping a few feet away.

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttAnnie?

tShe doesn't answer... as if she has found her own private 
tplace within her, at last... A place of strength. She looks as 
tif she knows what must be done... She hears him about to walk 
taway when she asks:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttCan we go for one more ride?

tTom stops. Considers this. Then:

<b>tttt  TOM
</b>ttSure. I'll saddle them up.

tHe exits. Not seeing the tears in Annie's eyes.

<b>tINT. BARN - DAY
</b>
tTom enters the barn slowly. He crosses to Rimrock's stall... 
tthen stops. As if he is waiting. As if he knows...

tThen... he hears the sound of Annie's Suburban starting up. He 
tlooks up and knows she's leaving. He waits.

<b>tEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tWide angle of Annie driving away in the Suburban with the 
ttrailer.

<b>tINT. SUBURBAN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tAnnie doesn't look back -- her eyes wet with tears -- but no 
tsobs.

<b>tINT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tTom lowers his head. It is not his way to say goodbye. And he 
tis moved by Annie's knowing.

<b>tEXT. HIGHWAYS & ROADS ACROSS AMERICA - DAYS & NIGHTS
</b>
tA MONTAGE of images of Annie traveling home...

tAcross different terrains, we see Annie driving -- missing 
tTom... thinking of what she will decide by the time she gets 
thome. Remembering IMAGES OF TOM:

t-- Riding on Rimrock and tipping his hat to her...

t-- Sitting in the pasture, staring at Pilgrim. Ignoring her.

t-- Seeing her arrive at the ranch for the very first time.

<b>tEXT. A DIFFERENT HIGHWAY OR COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</b>
tAnnie drives, she continues remembering...

t-- She and Tom in the branding...

t-- She and Tom dancing around the camp fire at the cattle drive.

t-- She and Tom kissing in secrecy behind Hank's house the night 
tof the barn dance...

<b>tEXT. ANOTHER HIGHWAY OR COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</b>
tAnnie continues driving and remembering;

t-- Annie and Tom coming towards each other that first night 
tafter everyone had left the ranch...

t-- Tom opening the front door to the ranch house...

<b>tSUDDENLY WE;
</b>
<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ROBERT'S HOUSE IN INDIA - A DAY REMEMBERED
</b>
tA much younger Annie waits, surrounded by luggage, as A DOOR 
tOPENS revealing a much younger, more vital, very handsome 
tRobert:

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttYes?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any 
tthotel room available and someone told 
ttme to come here and ask for "Tubab" 
ttwho might to have a place for me to 
ttstay. Are you "Tubab"?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttNo. I am a "tubab."

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttWhat do you mean?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttTubab means white man.

tAnnie is first surprised, then embarrassed but Robert seems so 
tcharming and his smile breaks into a laugh, that she just nods 
tand laughs herself.

<b>tINT. ROBERT'S HOME IN INDIA - A NIGHT REMEMBERED
</b>
tOver a meal, Robert talks excitedly of his experiences. Annie 
tis captivated.

<b>tINT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM IN INDIA - A NIGHT REMEMBERED
</b>
tAfter Annie and Robert have made love, Robert sleeps with his 
tarms wrapped around Annie. She lies awake, feeling safe and 
tloved.

<b>tttttttFADE OUT:
</b>
<b>tEXT. LITTLE BIGHORN NATIONAL MONUMENT - TWILIGHT
</b>
tAnnie stands where she stood when she and Grace stopped here on 
ttheir way to Montana...

tShe removes from her pocket the KNOTTED LOOP he made for her, 
tand looks at it.

<b>ttttttt  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MACLEAN CONNECTICUT HOME - DAY
</b>
tA car is driving up the driveway to the house. It stops.

tRobert and Grace get out as Annie exits from the front door. 
tShe looks beautiful -- but in a completely different way than 
tever before. There is a calm center to her. A softness and a 
tstrength. She smiles and walks to meet them.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttOh, I miss you. You look beautiful.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttSo do you.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttHow's everything?

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttGood.

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(to Robert)
ttHi.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttHi.

tThey kiss as Grace watches.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttWas the trip okay?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttMmm. I made good time.
ttt(to Grace)
ttPilgrim's in the back. I found a new 
ttstable, but they can't take him until 
tttomorrow.

<b>tttt  GRACE
</b>ttGreat!

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttGo ahead...

tGrace exits excitedly O.C. Annie and Robert face each other. 
tRobert doesn't know what to expect... but he softens when Annie 
tsmiles:

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttI have so much to tell you.

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttYou want to take a walk with me?

<b>tttt  ANNIE
</b>ttt(a little nervous)
ttWhere to?

<b>tttt  ROBERT
</b>ttt(smiles)
ttI don't know. Let's just go and... 
ttwe'll see...

tAnnie nods. He reaches for her hand, and Annie gives it 
twillingly... They begin to walk away from Camera... together.

tAnnie begins to speak, telling him what we already know. How 
the will react or what will happen, is unknown. But these two 
tpeople will no longer avoid their life together... somehow, 
tthey will make the effort to face it together.

tAs Camera Widens, we see included in the frame, Grace and 
tPilgrim... as she strokes him and whispers in his ear... and 
tleads him for a walk...
