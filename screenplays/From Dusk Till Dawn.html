</b>
<b>tEXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY
</b>
tA convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
tsurround it.

tCLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

tThe sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
<b>tWORLD OF LIQUOR.
</b>

</b>
tA Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
ta real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
tin full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
tmirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

tIt's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
toff duty for the day.

tThe only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth


<b>tINT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY
</b>
tA young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
tstool behind the counter.

tA few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

tA MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
tglasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
tbare feet. They look through magazines.

tAnother black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
tGIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
tbeer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
tseventeen.

tMCGRAW enters the store.

<b>ttttMCGRAW
</b>ttHot goddamn day!

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttHaven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
ttthe air conditioner blastin' all day
ttlong.

<b>ttttMCGRAW
</b>ttNot even for lunch?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttI'm by myself today, ate my lunch
ttoutta the microwave.

tMcGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
tevery night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
tjoins Pete by the front counter.

<b>ttttMCGRAW
</b>ttJesus Christ man, that microwave food
ttwill kill ya as quick as a bullet.
ttThose burritos are only fit for a
tthippie high on weed. Pull me down a
ttbottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
tttanked tonight.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWhatsamatter?

<b>ttttMCGRAW
</b>ttt(sighs)
ttAwww, it's just been a shitass day.
ttEvery inch of it hot and miserable.
ttFirst off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
ttgot some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
ttboy of hers was workin' the grill.
ttThat fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
ttfrom Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
ttat nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
ttblanket like a sick dog by ten
ttthirty.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttIsn't there a law or something
ttagainst retards serving food to the
ttpublic?

<b>ttttMCGRAW
</b>ttWell, if there ain't there sure oughta
ttbe. Who knows what goes on inside 
ttMongoloid's mind?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttYou could sue the shit out of her, ya
ttknow. That kid belongs under a circus
tttent, not flippin' burgers. You could
ttown that fuckin' place.

<b>ttttMCGRAW
</b>ttWhat the hell would I do with that
ttgrease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
ttenough of a cross to bear just taking
ttcare of that potato head. Then all
ttthis Abilene shit happened. You
ttheard about that bank robbery in
ttAbilene, didn't ya?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttThat's all that's been on the box
ttall day. They killed some people
ttdidn't they?

<b>ttttMCGRAW
</b>ttFour Rangers, three cops, and two
ttcivilians. And they took a lady bank
ttteller as a hostage.

tPete doesn't say anything.

<b>ttttMCGRAW
</b>ttThey'll probably make a run for the
ttborder, which would bring 'em this
ttway. And if we get our hands on
ttthose shit asses, we're talking
ttpayback time. We'll get 'em all right.
ttI gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
ttcommode.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttKnock yourself out.

tMcGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
texits in the bathroom.

tThe black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
twith the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
tWe see that the girl is crying.

<b>ttttBLACK SUITED MAN #1
</b>ttt(to Pete)
ttDo you think I'm fuckin' playing with
ttyou, asshole?
ttt(points to the tearful prep
ttt school girl)
ttDo you want this little girl to die?
ttt(pointing to the blonde with
ttt the other guy)
ttOr that little girl? Or your
ttbosombuddy with the badge? Or
ttyourself? I don't wanna do it, but
ttI'll turn this fuckin' store into the
ttWild Bunch if I even think you're
ttfuckin' with me.

tThe two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
tbank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
tAnd the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
tis the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
tthe blonde.

tEverybody speaks low and fast.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWhat do you want from me? I did what
ttyou said.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttLetting him use your toilet? No store
ttdoes that.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttHe comes in here every day and we
ttbullshit. He's used my toilet a
ttthousand times. If I told him no,
tthe'd know something was up.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
tthere, in his car, and down the road or
ttyou can change the name of this
ttplace to "Benny's World of Blood."

tRichard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
tleans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
tat Pete.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWere you giving that pig signals?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWhat? Are you kidding? I didn't do
ttanything!

tRichard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttHe says you were scratching.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttI wasn't scratching!

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou callin' him a liar?

tPete controls himself.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttI'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
ttsimply saying that if I was
ttscratching, and if I did scratch, it's
ttnot because I was signaling the cop,
ttit's because I'm fuckin' scared
ttshitless.

tRichard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
tSeth.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttThe Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
ttI just go in there, blow his head off
ttand get outta here.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttDon't do that! Look, you asked me to
ttact natural, and I'm acting as natural
tt-- in fact, under the circumstances, I
ttthink I ought get a fuckin' Academy
ttAward for how natural I'm acting. You
ttasked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
ttmy best.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYeah, well, your best better get a
tthelluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
ttgonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
ttworse.

tThe toilet FLUSHES.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttEverybody be cool.

tEverybody goes back to what they were doing.

tMcGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
tof the situation.

<b>ttttMCGRAW
</b>ttYeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
ttit tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
ttin front of the box and just drink
ttbooze. How much is the bottle?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttSix-fifty.

tOut of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
tand SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

tMcGraw goes down screaming.

tRichard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

tSeth charges forward.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(to Richard)
ttWhat the fuck was that about?

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttt(in a low monotone)
ttHe signaled the Ranger.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttt(hysterical)
ttI didn't.
ttt(to Seth)
ttYou gotta believe me, I didn't.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttt(to Seth)
ttWhen they were talkin', he mouthed
ttthe words "Help Us."

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttYou fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

tRichard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

tSeth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWhat the fuck is wrong with you --

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttSeth, he did it. You were by the beer
ttcooler with your back turned. I was by
ttthe magazines, I could see his face.
ttAnd I saw him mouth:

tRichard mouths the words, "Help Us."

tWhile Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
tfrom his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
tout a gun from it.

tSeth releases his brother.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttStart the car.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttYou believe me don't cha?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttShut up and start the car.

tRichard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

t...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
tthe hand.

tRichard FALLS to his knees, howling.

tBoth Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

tSeth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

tPete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

tRichard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

tThe two girls have run out screaming.


<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttRichie? You okay?

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttI'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
ttI told you that bastard said, "Help
ttus!"

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttI never said help us!

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttWell that don't matter now, 'cause
ttyou got about two fuckin' seconds
ttto live! Richie!

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttYeah?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttWhen I count three, shoot out the
ttbottles behind him!

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttGotcha!

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttOne... Two... Three.


tThe two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

tThey HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

tPete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
tRAIN down on him.

tSeth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

tRichard keeps FIRING.

tSeth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
tfire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

tThe flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

tThe fireball lands behind the counter.

tThe entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
tscreams from behind the counter.

tSeth smiles to himself and stands.

tRichard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

tPete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
tstill holding his weapon and FIRING.

tSeth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

tPete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
tPastry display.

tSeth and Richard rise from the rubble.



<b>tEXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY
</b>
tThey exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
tflames.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWhat did I tell you? What did I tell
ttyou? Buy the road map and leave.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttWhat am I supposed to do, Seth?
ttHe recognized us.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttHe didn't recognize shit.

tBoth Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttSeth, I'm telling you, the way he
ttlooked at us -- you especially --
ttI knew he knew.


tThey both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
tstarts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
thear Seth mumbling under the motor.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttLow profile. Do you know what the
ttwords "low profile" mean?

<b>tCLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.
</b>
tThe Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
tthe street, and speeds off down the road.

tWe CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust
tbehind it, as the store burns out of control.

<b>tOPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.
</b>
tRaunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>

<b>tEXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY
</b>
tThe Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
tOVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
ttrip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
tprescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
this hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
tslug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

tRichard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
tboxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

tThe camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
tand goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
ton the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:

tAN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.

tThe rest of the titles play over black as the song
tcontinues.

<b>tINT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY
</b>
tEmma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
tcowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
tthe maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

tIt stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
tFAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
tcategory. The members of the unit consist of the father,
tJACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
tand his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
tpossesses what can only be described as an apple pie
tsensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
tcomplete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
tVietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
twho always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
tgarage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
tof them are wolfing down a late lunch.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttWe got about two more hours of day
ttlight left. That'll get us into
ttEl Paso, which is right next to the
ttborder. We'll stop at a motel --

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttStop? We're not going to actually
ttstop at a motel, are we?

tScott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
tthat Jacob has said about three hundred times.

<b>ttttSCOTT AND KATE
</b>ttWe've got a Winnebago. We don't need
ttthose over priced roach havens. We're
ttself contained.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttOkay, Okay, maybe I was a little
ttoverzealous, but give me a break, I
ttjust bought it.

tScott and Kate continue the impersonation.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttWhy, just look at all this. You got

</b>ttFeel this, real wood paneling. That's
ttreal wood, too, not that fake stuff.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttUnless you two wiseacres wanna be

ttwhat say we drop this?

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttt(to Kate)
ttThe truth hurts.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttt(to Scott)
ttIt's the bitterest of pills.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttYou two ought to start a stand-up

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttAin't it the truth.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttWhy do you want to stop?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI'm exhausted.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttLie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
ttinto Mexico.

tJacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
tnew motor home."

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI just bet you would. Don't even thin
ttabout it. Besides, I want to have one
ttnight's sleep in an
tthonest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
ttthe home are okay, but they're not
ttlike a real bed.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttHey, if we go to a motel, we can
ttswim.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttI'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
ttthe bathroom.

tScott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
trestroom.

tJacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
tsilence before...

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttDad, when I called the machine to
ttcheck our messages there was one from
ttBethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
ttwouldn't permanently replace you until
ttwe came back. He said when we come
tthome, if you still feel the same
ttway --

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttThat's very nice of Ted, but I'll
ttcall him tomorrow and tell him not
ttto bother waiting.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttI didn't want to talk about this in
ttfront of Scott because he gets upset.
ttBut you don't believe in God
ttanymore?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNot enough to be a pastor. Look, I
ttknow this is hard on you kids. After
ttJenny's death, this is probably the
ttlast thing you need. But I can't do
ttit any longer. My congregation needs
ttspiritual leadership. Well, they can't
ttget that from me anymore. My faith is
ttgone. To answer your question, yes,
ttI do believe in Jesus. But do I love
ttthem? No. After Jenny died, I just
ttthought, what's the point?

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttt(pushing him)
ttIt's just, all our lives you've been
tta pastor. For twenty years you've
ttpreached trust in the lord. And then
ttone day you wake up and say fuck him?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
ttconnected anymore.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttThat happens, you'll get it back.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttKate, give your old man a little
ttcredit. Every person who chooses the
ttservice of God as their life's work
tthas something in common. I don't care
ttif you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
tta rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
ttmany times during your life you'll
ttlook at your reflection in the mirror
ttand ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
ttall done it. I'm not going through a
ttlapse. What I've experienced is closer
ttto awakening. I'm not trying to shake
ttyour faith. I've just decided not to
ttdevote my life to God anymore.

tSeth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's

tSeth rises.

</b>ttWanna come up here on the bed and

tYou can tell she doesn't want to.

tSeth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
tHe can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
tThen he BURSTS open the door.

tThe dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's

tthe Old-Timer.

tthinking about how he's going to get over the border
ttonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
tFuller's motor home.

tJacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both

<b>tTHUD... THUD...

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttOwww, my head.

tJacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the

</b>ttWhat's this guy's problem?

tSeth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
tmove. Not threatening, just looking at them.

<b>tHONK!
</b>
<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttAnytime, man.

tThe horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
ton the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
tside to let them pass.

tPass they do!

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttCreepy guy.

<b>tSETH
</b>
tThe Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
tjust solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed

tborder. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
troom #9.

tScott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
telectric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

tKNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
tshit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.

tHe looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
toblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

tFrom the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)

tJacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI hope none of this is disturbing you.

tScott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
the smiles.

tJacob opens the door and sees...

t... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
tnicest guy in the entire world.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttHi there, I'm from room 9, my name is

ttpossibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
ttright back.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttt(still partially asleep)
ttSure.

tWe follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
tice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
tcouple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

tHe sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
tclosed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttWhat is this?

tSeth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttIt's called a punch.

tScott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
tand instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
tmouth.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttSit down.

tScott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttGood boy.

tJacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
this lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

</b>ttJacob.

tKeeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

</b>ttIt's about money, all right, but not

tThe door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
tKate walks in.

tThe brothers spin their guns in her direction.

tKate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
tand move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
tready to spit.

</b>ttJust listen to daddy, sugar, and don't

ttt(he turns to Jacob and Scott,
ttt who are still standing)
ttYou two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

tThey slowly sit.

tRichard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

tBoth Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
tfor their own reasons.

</b>ttt(to Jacob)
ttWhere are the keys to the motor home?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttOn the dresser.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttRichie, take the keys. Start that big
ttbastard up, and drive it up front.

tRichard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
tfeels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

tHe looks in her face.

</b>tShe smiles at him.

tEverybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

tWithout saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the

</b>ttt(pointing at Kate)
ttYou, Gidget, go in the bathroom and

</b>ttLook, if you want the motor home, just

tSeth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male

</b>ttSorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that

tWe hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

tScott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,

</b>
tThe motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
tthe Lone Star night.


<b>tINT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT
</b>
tRichard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
tand Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

</b>ttExcuse me.

</b>ttWhat's in Mexico?

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttMexicans.

tHe doesn't smile.

tIn the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
twheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
tseat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him
tcalmly.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(reading his driver's license)
ttJacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,

ttt(motioning behind him)

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttScott and Kate.

tSeth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttScott and Kate... Kate and Scott...

tSeth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWho's this?

</b>ttMy wife.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWhere is the little lady?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttIn heaven.

</b>ttShe's dead?

<b>ttttJACOB

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttHow'd she die?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttAuto wreck.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttCome on, gimme some more details.
ttHow'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
ttkill her?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNo. It was a rainy night, the brakes
tton the car weren't great. She had to
ttstop suddenly. She slid on the road,
ttshe crashed, she died.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttDied instantly?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNot quite. She was trapped in the
ttwreck for about six hours before she
ttpassed on.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWhewww! Those acts of God really stick
ttit in and break it off, don't they?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttYes, they do.

tSeth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
tlicense.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttIs this real?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI've seen one of these before. A
ttfriend of mine had himself declared
tta minister of his own religion. Away
ttto fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
ttdoing, or are you the real McCoy?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttReal McCoy.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou're a preacher?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI was a minister.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWas? As in not anymore?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWhy'd ya quit?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI think I've gotten about as up close
ttand personal with you as I'm gonna
ttget. Now if you need me like I think
ttyou need me, you're not gonna kill me
tt'cause I won't answer your stupid,
ttprying questions. So, with all due
ttrespect, mind your own business.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
ttbe so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
ttfriendly. But you're right, enough
ttwith the getting to know you shit.
ttNow, there's two ways we can play this
tthand. One way is me and you go round
ttan' round all fuckin' night. The other
ttway, is we reach some sort of an
ttunderstanding. Now, if we go down that
ttfirst path at the end of the day, I'll
ttwin. But we go down the second, we'll
ttboth win. Now, I don't give a rat's
ttass about you or your fuckin' family.
ttY'all can live forever or die this
ttsecond and I don't care which. The
ttonly things I do care about are me
ttthat son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
ttour money. And right now I need to get
ttthose three things into Mexico. Now,
ttstop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
ttyou don't give a shit about seeing me
ttand my brother receiving justice, or
ttthe bank getting its money back. Right
ttnow all you care about is the safety
ttof your daughter, your son and
ttpossibly yourself. Am I correct?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI thought so. You help us get across
ttthe border without incident, stay with
ttus the rest of the night without
tttrying anything funny, and in the
ttmorning we'll let you and your family
ttgo. That way everybody gets what they
ttwant. You and your kids get out of
ttthis alive and we get into Mexico.
ttEverybody's happy.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttHow do I know you'll keep your word?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttJesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
ttthis shit.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttYou want me to sit here and be
ttpassive. The only way being passive in
ttthis situation makes sense is if I
ttbelieve you'll let us go. I'm not
ttthere yet. You have to convince me
ttyou're telling the truth.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttLook, dickhead, the only thing you
ttneed to be convinced about is that
ttyou're stuck in a situation with a
ttcoupla real mean motor scooters. I
ttdon't wanna hafta worry about you all
ttfuckin' night. And I don't think you
ttwanna be worrying about my brother's
ttintentions toward your daughter all
ttnight. You notice the way he looked
ttat her, didn't ya?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttDidn't like it, did ya?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNo, I didn't.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttDidn't think so. So, as I was saying,
ttI'm willing to make a deal. You
ttbehave, get us into Mexico, and don't
tttry to escape. I'll keep my brother
ttoff your daughter and let you all
ttloose in the morning.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttYou won't let him touch her?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI can handle Richie, don't worry.

tThe two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
tSeth sticks out his hand.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI give you my word.

tSeth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
tword.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(hand sticks out)
ttMy words, my law. Better you not take
ttit, and that's just where we are,
ttthen take it and not mean it.

tJacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttIf he touches her, I'll kill him. I
ttdon't give a fuck how many guns you
tthave, nothing will stop me from
ttkilling him.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttFair enough. You break your word, I'll
ttkill all of you.
ttt(calling to the back)
ttKate, honey!

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou must have a bible in here, don't
ttcha?

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttYeah, we got a bible.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttGet it and bring it up here, will
ttya, please?

tKate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
tfront.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttHold it right there, sweetie pie.
ttt(to Jacob)
ttPut your hand on it.

tJacob does.

</b>ttSwear to God, on the Bible, you won't
tttry to escape and you'll get us across
ttthe border.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI swear to God I won't try to escape
ttand I'll do my best to get you into
ttMexico.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou best better get it done, Pops.

tSeth places his hand on the Bible.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI swear to God I'll let you loose in the

tAutomobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into

tRichard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

tThe bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a

ttI need your cover. Cover my ass.

tThere's a HONK behind them.

tA stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

</b>ttHow many with you?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttJust my son and I.

tBORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

tHE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
ton the toilet.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttDo you mind? Shut the fucking door.

<b>ttttBORDER GUARD
</b>ttExcuse me.

tHe closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
tSeth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
tthe floor of the shower knocked out.

tSeth and Kate meet eyes.

tHe gives her the O.K. signal.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttIt's clear.

tSeth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttGoddamn, that was. intense!

tSeth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
tfarther and farther away. No cars following.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(to himself)
ttWe did it.
ttt(pause)
ttWe're in Mexico.

tSeth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

tSeth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of

ttCome here, Kate!

tKate, nervous, takes a step back.

tHe charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,

tdizzily onto the bed.

<b>ttttSETH

tcrab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
tMexico.

tThe Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
tnowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
tmiles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
tparked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
tRAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
toutside reading things like: 

<b>t"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
</b><b>t"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",

tIn the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit

tA SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
tA greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
tlot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

</b>ttt(to the group)
ttOkay, troops, this is the homestretch.
ttHere's the deal; this place closes at

ttsometime before dawn. Which by my
ttguesstimate is somewhere between three
ttor four hours from now. So we're gonna
ttgo in there, take a seat, have a drink
tt-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
ttfor Carlos. That could be an hour,
ttthat could be three hours, I don't
ttknow which. But when he gets here,
ttme and Richie are going to leave
ttwith him. After we split, you guys
ttare officially out of this stewpot.
ttLet me just say I'm real happy about

tEverybody nods and mutters in agreement.

<b>tEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>tThe camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
tFuller family step out into the night.

tThey look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
tIt literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttOut of the stew pot and into the fire.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttShit, I been to bars make this place

</b>ttt(in a baby talk voice)
ttAww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
ttbaby too afraid to go into the big
ttscary bar?

tThe two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
tbut like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
tpersonal.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttThat's what you think?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttThat's how you're lookin', Richie.

<b>ttttRICHARD

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttMy shit is together.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttIt don't look together.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWell, it is. Just because I'm happy
ttdoesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
ttjust not used to seein' me happy,
tt'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
ttyears since I been happy. But my shit
ttis forever together.

tRichard believes Seth's response.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttOkay, just checkin'.

tThey walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
tthe microphone.

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttt(yelling into the microphone)
ttTake advantage of our penny pussy sale.
ttBuy any piece of pussy a tour regular
ttprice, you get another piece of pussy,
ttof equal or lesser value, for a penny.
ttNow try and beat pussy for a penny!
ttIf you can find cheaper pussy
ttanywhere, fuck it!

tChet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttt(in microphone, towards Kate)
ttWhat's this? A new flavor approaching.
ttApple Pie Pussy.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttStep aside, asshole.

tChet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttNot so fast, Slick.

tSeth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
tthe BONE SNAPS in two.

tChet lets out a SCREAM.

tSeth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
<b>tNOSE.
</b>
tChet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

tSeth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
tSNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

tAfter HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
tto Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

tChet is OUT.

tThe whole altercation took two seconds.

tEveryone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
teveryone.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttNow, is my shit together, or is my
ttshit together?

tRichard and Seth laugh with each other.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttt(slappin' Seth five)
ttYour shit is forever together!

tThey head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
tand gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,


<b>tINT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
</b>
tIf the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
tfrom the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
tain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
tthey sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
tand the beer at closing.

tIn the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
twhile a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
tat ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
tBAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
tbikers and truckers.

tOne of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
tname is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
tthe saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
tATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
tcrowd.

tBikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
there about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
tbut the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

tSeth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
tThey each individually take in the sights and the smells.
tSeth is the first to say something.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttNow this is my kinda place! I could
ttbecome a regular.

tThe man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
tas they approach.

tTheir difference from the usual road waif nomads who
tpopulate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
tlook across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
tup to the bar.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWhiskey!

<b>ttttRAZOR CHARLIE
</b>ttt(in English)
ttYou can't come in here.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWhat dya mean?

<b>ttttRAZOR CHARLIE
</b>ttThis is a private club. You're not
ttwelcome.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttAre you tellin' me I'm not good enough
ttto drink here?

<b>ttttRAZOR CHARLIE
</b>ttThis bar is for bikers and truckers
ttonly.
ttt(points his finger to Seth)
ttYou, get out!

tBig Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
tHIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

<b>ttttBIG EMILIO
</b>ttt(to Seth in Spanish)
ttWalk, Pendaho.

tSeth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(low)
ttTake your hand off me.

<b>ttttBIG EMILIO
</b>ttt(Spanish)
ttI'm going to count to three.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttNo, I'm going to count to three.

<b>ttttBIG EMILIO
</b>ttUno...

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttTwo..

tJacob jumps in the middle.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNow wait a minute, there's no reason
ttto get ugly. There's just a
ttmisunderstanding going on here. You
ttsaid this bar is for truckers and
ttbikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

tEverybody looks at Jacob.

tAs Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttIf you look outside your door, parked
ttin your parking lot, you'll see a big
ttass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
ttIn order to drive that legally, you
ttneed a class two driver's license.
ttThat is the same license that the
ttDMV requires truck drivers to carry
ttin order to drive a truck.
ttt(he takes the license out
ttt of his wallet and lays it
ttt on the bar)
ttThat is me, and this is my class two
ttlicense. This is a truck driver's bar,
ttI am a truck driver, and these are
ttmy friends.

tEverybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

tRazor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
teveryone in the party and smiles.

<b>ttttRAZOR CHARLIE
</b>ttt(to Jacob)
ttWelcome to the Titty Twister. What
ttcan I get you?

tSeth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttBottle of whiskey and five glasses.

tRazor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
tsmile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
tBut instead he just says,

<b>ttttRAZOR CHARLIE
</b>ttComing right up.

tRazor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
tparty one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
tbuddy punch on the shoulder.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttGood job, Pops.

tSeth's still frying an egg on his head.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttThat's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
ttnumber one problem with Mexico, it's
ttnot service oriented. I was feelin'
ttso good, and those fuckin' spies
ttbrought me down.

tRichard puts his arm around Seth.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttFuck 'em, shake it off.

tRazor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
tat the guy, still pissed.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou serve food, Jose?

tRazor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
tbut he just smiles and says,

<b>ttttRAZOR CHARLIE
</b>ttBest in Mexico.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
tttable, send over a waitress to take
ttour order.

tSeth walks away, and the group follows him.

tWe just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
tCharlie's head.

tThe five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
twalk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
tfrom some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

tThe dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
twild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

tRichard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttAnytime you want a lap dance with that
ttbroad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

tHe gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
tsurroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
twords about the party in Spanish.

<b>ttttRAZOR CHARLIE
</b>ttt(in Spanish)
ttThey're not the normal road trash we
ttnormally feed on. But it'll be okay.
ttNo one knows they're here.

tThe five of them find a table and sit down.

tSeth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
tbottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWho else?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttPass.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(picking a fight)
ttWhy not, against your religion?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttt(won't be baited)
ttNo, I do drink, I'm just not drinking

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttSuit yourself, more for me.
ttt(to Scott)
ttScotty?

tScott shakes his head no.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(to Kate)
ttHow 'bout you?
ttt(pointing at Scott and Kate)
ttare safer in here with us than
ttwandering around a Mexican border town
ttall night long. Just don't do nothin'
ttstupid and we'll all get along fine.
ttt(to Scott)
ttScotty, you sure you don't want a
ttdrink?

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttOkay, I'll have one.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNo you won't.

tSeth pours Scott a shot.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttSorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
ttdon't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
ttup, boy.

tScott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
ton-drinker's tremor.

tSeth turns to Kate.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttHow about you, cutie pie? Ready for
ttround two?

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttOkay.

tSeth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
tknocks it back.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttt(to Seth)
ttHey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
ttjust created a monster.

tJacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttWhy are you so agitated?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI'm still stewing about that ape
ttlaying hands on me. And that fuckin'
ttbartender sticks a weed up my ass,
tttoo.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttHe backed down.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttHe's smilin' at us. But behind his
ttsmile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
ttI hear that loud and clear.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttWhat are you going to do?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(picking up the whiskey bottle)
ttI'm gonna just sit here and drain
ttthis bottle. And when I've drunk the
ttlast drop, if I still feel then, the
ttway I feel now, I'm gonna take this
ttbottle and break it over his melon
tthead.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttBefore we stepped in here, you told
ttall of us to be cool. That means you,
tttoo.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(tossing it off)
ttI never said do what I do, I said do
ttwhat I say.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttAre you so much a fucking loser, you
ttcan't tell when you've won?

tRichard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
tbelieve what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
tdown his drinking glass.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWhat did you call me?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNothing. I didn't make a statement. I
ttasked a question. Would you like me to
ttask it again? Very well. Are you such
tta loser you can't tell when you've
ttwon?
ttt(pause)
ttThe entire state of Texas, along with
ttthe FBI, is looking for you. Did they
ttfind you? No. They couldn't. They had
ttevery entrance to the border covered.
ttThere's no way you could get across.
ttDid you? Yes, you did. You've won,
ttSeth, enjoy it.

tSeth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttJacob, I want you to have a drink with
ttme. I insist.

tJacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
tin Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttTo your family.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttTo yours.

tThey both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNow, is your shit together?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttForever together.

tSeth turns to Scott.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttIn that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
ttit that's yours.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttYeah, it's mine.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttGo out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

<b>tttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
tSeth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
tsongs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
taround their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
tsong. Everybody applauds.

tRazor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
tthat he uses to announce dancers.

<b>ttttRAZOR CHARLIE
</b>ttt(announcer voice in Spanish)
ttAnd now for your viewing pleasure. The
ttMistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
ttof Evil. The most sinister woman to
ttdance on the face of the earth. Lowly
ttdogs, get on your knees, bow your
ttheads and worship at the feet of
<b>ttSANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!
</b>
tThe lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
tnotes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

tThe crowd hushes up.

tAnd on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

tThis Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
tStendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
tthe beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

tShe dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
tstage, but like she owned the world.

tAnd if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
tworld is proud to be her possession.

tAll activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
tFuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
tRichard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
taccompanies from the table with the guitar.

tWhen the music builds to its explosive section.

tSantanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
troom.

tShe does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
tthe beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
tlooking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
tand points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

tAs the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
tfrom the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

tRichard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

tSantanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
tShe STANDS OVER him.

tWhile moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
tbottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

tShe lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
ttoes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

<b>ttttSANTANICO
</b>ttt(to Richard in Spanish)
ttDrink up.

tRichie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
tCROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
tsurveys.

tJacob and Scott are embarrassed.

tKate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
tthis woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

tSeth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
tthe beat with his guitar.

tAcross the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
tover Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
tSeth and company did to Chet.

tRichard continues to suck her toes.

tThe song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
tmouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
tdown at the seated Richard.

tShe GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
tmouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
tOVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
tfrom her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
tapplauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
tand Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
tnone louder than Seth.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttBravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
ttI call a fuckin' show!

tOne of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
twhich she puts on.

tRichard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(snapping his fingers)
ttEarth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
ttyour new friend to join us?

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWell, then ask her, dumb ass.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttt(looking up at Santanico)
ttPor favor, Senorita. Would you care to
ttjoin us?

<b>ttttSANTANICO
</b>ttt(to Richard)
ttMuy bien, gracias.

tSantanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttRichie, you lucky bastard!
ttt(to Santanico)
ttNow, little lady, you could of just as
tteasily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
ttYou got my dick harder 'n Chinese
ttarithmetic.

tThe table laughs.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWhich reminds me of a joke. Little Red
ttRiding Hood is walking through the
ttforest and she comes across Little Bo
ttPeep, and Little Bo Peep says:
tt"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
ttcrazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
ttis walking these woods and if he finds
ttyou he's gonna pull down your dress
ttand squeeze your titties?" Then Little
ttRed Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
ttand taps a .357 Magnum she has
ttholstered on her thigh and says: "No
tthe won't."

tAs Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
tEmilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttt(to himself)
ttOh, shit.
ttt(to Seth)
ttSeth --

tSeth waves him away.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttNot now. So finally she comes across
ttthe Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
ttWolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
ttRiding Hood, you know better than to
ttbe walking around these woods alone.
ttYou know I'm just gonna have to pull
ttdown your dress and squeeze your
tttitties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
ttwhips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
ttit in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
ttsays: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
ttme, just like the story says."

tSeth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
tKate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
tanything --

tThe Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

<b>ttttRAZOR CHARLIE
</b>ttt(to Chet in Spanish)
ttWhich one?

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttt(pointing at Seth)
ttThis piece of shit broke my finger
ttand my nose...
ttt(pointing at Richard)
ttthen this fag kicked me in the ribs
ttwhile I was down.

tThat's all Big Emilio has to hear.

<b>ttttBIG EMILIO
</b>ttt(to The Gecko Brothers)
ttUp!

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttFuck off, ape man!

tBig Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
tthe shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
this wounded shoulder.

tSantanico steps back from the table.

tSeth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
tBig Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
tRazor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
tand SLASHES Seth across the face.

tSeth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
this laid open cheek.

tRichard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
tbrings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

tRazor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
tbefore he hits the floor.

tJacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
tout of gunfire.

tThe bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
tthey were doing.

tThe music continues to play, though the dancers stop
tdancing.

tSantanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
tsomething.

tHer NOSTRILS FLARE.

tRichard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
tand puts it to his face.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttHow are you?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttScarred for life, that's how I am!

tSeth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou thought it was pretty funny,
ttdidn't you?

tBoth brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
tleft... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
tthe crowd.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttEverybody be cool, or you'll be just
ttas dead as these fucks!

tSLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

tSLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

tThe CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
twaitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

tSLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
tto the floor, splattering.

tWE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
ther nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
tcould easily be read as intense sexual desire.

<b>tCLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR
</b>
tLooks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
ttransformation.

tHer NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
tof her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
ther mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttRichie, look out!

tBefore Richie can turn around.

tSANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
tSINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

tRichard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

tSeth turns to his brother's cry.

tHe sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
ta cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
tdeep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
tabout, trying to knock her off.

tRichard screams to Seth:

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttShoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

tSeth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
tcan't get a clear shot.

tJacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

tRichard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
trides him down to the floor.

tSeth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
tvamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

tRichard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
thalf way before he stops, saying:

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttt(with his dying breath)
ttFucking Bitch!

tHe tumbles over, a corpse.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttRichie.

tSuddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
tPussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
ttheir faces.

tThe patrons scream.

tA WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
twith steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
tand yells:

<b>ttttWHORE
</b>ttDinner is served!

tThe bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
tthe impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
tand whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
tturned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
<b>tVAMPIRES.
</b>
tThe vamps attack.

tWhat follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
tsitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
tnecks.

tNaked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
tTruckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
tThe patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
tmonsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
tanything.

tJacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
tThey hide and watch.

tSeth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
ttoo freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
tmotionless, watching what he can't believe.

tBehind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
teyes POP OPEN.

tShe RISES in her snake/dance way.

tSeth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

<b>ttttSANTANICO
</b>ttLet's see if you taste as good as your
ttbrother.

tShe approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
tCLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
thair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

tSantanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
tJAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
tFLOOR and INTO the WALL.

tA bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
tside of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
tpool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

tBig Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
tswitchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
tbar to the other.

tThe biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
tgoes head to head with a stripper.

tThe vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
tclose to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
tvamp bitch blow for blow.

tThen he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
tand BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
ton the wooden leg.

tFROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
tappears, straight razor in hand.

tFrost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
tCharlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
tcue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
tUPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
tCharlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
tthe cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

tGreen blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
tvampire's death scream.

tSeth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
ttries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
tchest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
tthe pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
tplaced on his chest.

<b>ttttSANTANICO
</b>ttI'm not gonna drain you completely.
ttYou're gonna turn for me, You'll be
ttmy slave. You'll live for me. You'll
tteat bugs because I order it. Because
ttI don't think you're worthy of human
ttblood, you'll feed on the blood of
ttstray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
ttAnd at my command, you'll lick the dog
ttshit from my boot heel. Since you'll
ttbe my dog, your new name will be
tt"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

tSLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
tt end over end.

<b>tCLOSE-UP SANTANICO
</b>
tlooking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
tthe bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

tWe see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

tSantanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
tmomentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

tSeth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

tSantanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
tthe liquor-soaked robe ignite.

tSantanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

tBig Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

<b>ttttBIG EMILIO
</b>ttNoooooo!

tHe turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

tSeth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
tsee him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
tJacob.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWe may be in trouble.

tBig Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
twalks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
tvamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
tout Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
thim, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
taside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

tBig Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
tSeth and Jacob.

tSeth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
tweapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

tBig Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
twood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
tlook like a huge walking shark.

tJust when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttHey, you, monkey man!

tBig Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttAnything you gotta say to them, say
ttto me first.

tBoth Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
teffortlessly knocks them away.

tThey both hit the ground.

tSex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
tahead."

tBig Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
tlocomotive.

tSex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
thuge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
tGargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
tbuckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
twho HITS the floor.

tOnce on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
tBEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
tvamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
tsavage beating.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttThat's enough.

tJacob and Seth stop.

tSex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
tend tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
tbig vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
tdies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
tvamp.

tChet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
tbreaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
taround his mouth.

tKate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
tover the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
tprotect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
ttrouble. Chet dives at Kate.

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttYou know what everybody says about me?
ttI suck!

tChet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
ther crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
this head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
toff her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
this mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
tup back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

<b>tGULP.
</b>
tChet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
tmoving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
tmouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
tjumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
tHe jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
tall the while.

tKate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
ttheir faces.

tChet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
tof his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

<b>ttttCHET
</b><b>ttI-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!
</b>
tChet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

<b>ttttCHET
</b>ttStop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
ttpain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

tHe plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
tvampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
tstaked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

tBy this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
tvampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
tcustomers have been butchered or drained.

tAll that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
tand two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
tkids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
tare hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
twooden stakes.

tThe four human men group together. The four female vampires
tcharge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
tSeth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
tslam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
tstaked bodies hit the floor.

tKate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
tside.

tThey all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
ttaken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttAin't they supposed to burn up or
ttsomething?

tAt that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
teveryone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
tthe air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
tlight, which lasts only a split second.

tIt vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
tthat remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
tonce lay.

tThey all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
tfor the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
tuseless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

tExcept for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
tto his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

tHe takes his dead hand.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttRichie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
ttYou'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
ttfind peace there. I love you little
ttbrother, I'll miss ya bad.

tSeth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
tPOP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttI'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
ttlove you, too.

tRichard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
tdown to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
tHe SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
tto striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
tbite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
tfrom Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
tsurrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
thead. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
twall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
twhere the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
twood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
twhips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttTouch my brother with that stake,
ttbiker, and vampires won't need to
ttsuck your blood, they'll be able to
ttlick it up off the floor.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttHe ain't your brother no more.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttThat's a matter of opinion, and I
ttdon't give a fuck about your's.

tJacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
tthe ground.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttDon't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

tSeth aims his gun at the group.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttShut up!

tRichard's giggling.

<b>ttttRICHARD
</b>ttYeah, shut up.

tSeth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
tout of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttHold him down.

tThe smile evaporates from Richard's face.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttRichie, here's the peace in death I
ttcould never give you in life.

tSeth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
this .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
theart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
tbody as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
tSeth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
tHe grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
tof all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
tthe bar.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttAre you okay?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttPeachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
ttworld's my oyster, except for the
ttfact that I just rammed a wooden
ttstake in my brother's heart because

ttthough I don't believe in vampires.
ttAside from that unfortunate business,
tteverything's hunky-dory.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttI'm really sorry.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttBullshit! You hate us. If you had half
tta chance you'd feed us to them!

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttThen why didn't I?

tJacob walks over to Seth.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI saved your life. I didn't have to,
ttbut I did. And I'm sorry you lost your

ttsorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
ttgonna get out of this we need each
ttother. And we need you sober and
ttthinking, not drunk and...

tAs Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
tgrown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
tidentify it.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttWhat the hell is that?

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttAt first I just thought it was birds.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttNo, it's more of a gnawing sound.
ttBirds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
ttgnaw.

tSeth puts the bottle in his hand down.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttIt's bats.


<b>tEXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT
</b>
tThe outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
thats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
tinside.


<b>tINT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT
</b>
tEverybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
talong the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
tscared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
tdo next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
tclaws poke their way through.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttGive me a hand!

tJacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
tthe bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
titems to help secure and barricade the door.

tAs the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
tthe windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
topen his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
tactivity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
tfriend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
tputting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
tPOUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
troom in her direction.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttWatch out, girly!

tThe biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
tscream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
tshe's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
tothers hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
tBig Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
tAs the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
tof Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
tvamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
tand spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
tSWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
tthe bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
tvamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
tof the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
theart. He dies and bursts into flames.

tAt that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
tposition. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
tground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttt(mumbling to himself)
ttGoddamn fuckin' vampires.

tThe biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
tHunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
tfeet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
tflames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
tSMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
ta loop.

tAs CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
ton his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
tstack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
tby the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
tlying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
traises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
tvamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
twhich hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttFire!

tFrost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

<b>ttttFROST

ttWe'll put this out. You stake the rest

tKate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
twork STAKING the dead bodies.

tJacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
twhatever else is at hand.

tA hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
tover. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
tin front of the window.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttWe got a problem!

tSeth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
tdirection. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
ta little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
tSQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
tbody through the newly formed hole.

tSeth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
tpoint-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

tThe bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
this head back through the hole.

tSeth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
twhen...

<b>tWHAM !
</b>
tThe bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a

tLANDING HARD on his back.

tOnce Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
tof a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
tRUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
tbat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
tits CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
tinches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttGet this bastard off of me!

tFrost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
tGRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

tSex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
tpreventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
tdead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
tbody SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
tsquirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
tdown in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
tSex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
this shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
tget bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

tFrost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
tfront of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
twhile, then...

tBASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
tfight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
tagainst the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
tbat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
tcup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
theart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
tFLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

tSex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
twindow with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
tthe bat-thing.

tJacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
texhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
tto try and claw their way in.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttIs everybody okay?

tEveryone mutters "yeah."

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttOkay, does anybody here know what's
ttgoing on?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYeah, I know what's going on. We got
tta bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
tttrying to get inside and suck our
ttfuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
ttsimple. And I don't wanna hear any
ttbullshit about "I don't believe in
ttvampires" because I don't fuckin'
ttbelieve in vampires either. But I do
ttbelieve in my own two fuckin' eyes,
ttand with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
ttvampires! Now, does everybody agree
ttwe're dealin' with vampires.

tEverybody agrees.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou too, preacher?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI'm like you. I don't believe in
ttvampires, but I believe in what I saw.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttGood for you. Now, since we all
ttbelieve we're dealing with vampires,
ttwhat do we know about vampires?
ttCrosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
ttcross?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttIn the Winnebago.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttIn other words, no.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttWhat are you talking about? We got
ttcrosses all over the place. All you
ttgotta do is put two sticks together
ttand you got a cross.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttHe's right. Peter Cushing does that
ttall the time.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI don't know about that. In order for
ttit to have any power, I think it's
ttgotta be an official crucifix.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttWhat's an official cross? Some piece
ttof tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
ttofficial? If a cross works against
ttvampires, it's not the cross itself,
ttit's what the cross represents. The
ttcross is a symbol of holiness.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttOkay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
ttcovered, moving right along, what
ttelse?

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWooden stakes in the heart been
ttworkin' pretty good so far.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttGarlic, holy water, sunlight... I
ttforget, does silver do anything to a
ttvampire?

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttThat's werewolves.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttI know silver bullets are werewolves.
ttBut I'm pretty sure silver has some
ttsort of effect on vampires.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttDoes anybody have any silver?

<b>ttttALL
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttThen who cares?

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttWhen's sunrise?

tJacob looks at his watch.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttAbout two hours from now.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttSo all we have to do is get by for a
ttfew more hours and then we can walk
ttright out the front door.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttYeah, that's true, but I doubt our
ttbarricades, that door, those plastered
ttwindows and these walls will last two
ttmore hours with those bat fucks
ttfuckin' with 'em.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttHas anybody here read a real book
ttabout vampires, or are we just
ttremembering what a movie said? I mean
tta real book.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttYou mean like a Time-Life book?

tEverybody laughs.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttt(in a cowboy voice)
ttJohn Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
ttshot a man for snorin'.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI take it the answer's no. Okay then,
ttwhat do we know about these vampires?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttAside from they're thirsty.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWell, one thing, they might got super
tthuman strength, but you can hurt 'em.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttYeah, that bottle upside the head of
ttSantanico didn't kill her, but it
ttdidn't feel too good either.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttAnother thing, you try and ram a
ttbroken chair leg in a human, you
ttbetter be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
ttThe human body is one rough-tough
ttmachine. But these vamps got soft
ttbodies. The texture of their skin is
ttsofter, mushier. You can push shit
ttright through 'em. Conceivably, if
ttyou hit one hard enough, you could
tttake their fuckin' head off.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttYou could take their head off.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttActually, our best weapon against
ttthese satanic cocksuckers is this man.
ttt(he points at Jacob)
ttHe's a preacher.

tFrost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttAs far as God's concerned, we might
ttjust as well be a piece of fuckin'
ttshit. But he's one of the boys. Only
ttone problem, his faith ain't what it
ttused to be.

tJacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
tJacob stands over him.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI've had enough of your taunts.

tSeth looks up from the floor.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI'm not taunting you. We need you. A
ttfaithless preacher doesn't mean shit
ttto us. But a man who's a servant of
ttGod can grab a cross, shove it in
ttthese monsters' asses. A servant of
ttGod can bless the tap water and turn
ttit into a weapon.

tSeth rises.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI know why you lost your faith. How
ttcould true holiness exist if your wife
ttcan be taken away from you and your
ttchildren? Now, I always said God can
ttkiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
ttmy lifetime tune about thirty minutes
ttago' cause I know, without a doubt,
ttwhat's out there trying to get in
tthere is pure evil straight from hell.
ttAnd if there is a hell, and those
ttmonsters are from it, there's got to
ttbe a heaven. Now which are you, a
ttfaithless preacher or a mean,
ttmother fuckin' servant of God?

tJacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
tsticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttI'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
ttGod.

tThe laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
tsound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
tIt immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
tthey're in.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttI don't know if I can take two hours
ttof that noise.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttYou can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
ttno choice. How'd ya like twenty four
tthours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
ttwith only the rotting corpses of your
ttfriends to keep you company?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttBack in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
ttbehind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
ttwith my entire squad dead. They
ttthought they killed everybody, and
ttexcept for me, they were right. But it
ttwasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
ttblew up right next to me, that's why
ttI'm so pretty.

tThey thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
tthe bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
tpossum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
tlistening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
thour...

tAs Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
tthe camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
tcan't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
tdoesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
tsay:

<b>ttttMALE VOICE (V.O.)
</b>ttThirst.

t"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
taround: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
thear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

<b>ttttFEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
</b>ttThirst.

tWe hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE (V.O.)
</b>ttStop fucking saying that!

<b>ttttTWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
</b>ttThirst!

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE (V.O.)
</b>ttThat bite weren't nothin'. It just
tthurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
ttall. It barely punched the skin.

tSex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
tbiker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
tall the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
tmany voices, male, female, children saying:

<b>ttttVOICES (V.O.)
</b>ttThirst... Thirst... Thirst...

tSex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
tin a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
tand closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
tactually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
thas turned into a vampire.

tThe sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>tt...and then when I came back to my
ttsenses, I realized I had killed the
ttentire V.C. squadron single handedly.
ttMy bayonet had blood and chunks of
ttyellow flesh on it like some cannibal
ttshish kabob. And to this day I don't
tthave the slightest idea how I --

tSex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b><b>ttTHIRST!
</b>
tFrost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
tinto his neck.

tThe group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

tJacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
tpulling.

tSex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
tSINKS them in Jacob's arm.

tJacob SCREAMS and lets go.

tSeth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

tSex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
tbar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

tFrost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
tbleeding neck.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttI been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

tSex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
tsack of potatoes.

tHe smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
ttable.

tSex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
tleg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttt(to Sex Machine)
ttYou're dead, mother fucker! You're
ttgonna bite me! You just turned me
ttinto a vampire, asshole!

<b>ttttSEX MACHINE
</b>ttWhat are you gonna do about it?

tFrost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
tstraight at Sex Machine.

tSex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
tpulls it back, so he can really haul off.

tFrost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
tloose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
tfloor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
tCOLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
thard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
tthrough the air.

tSeth sees where Frost is heading and says:

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttOh shit!

tJacob sees.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttGood lord!

tFrost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
tand CRASHES through it.

tSex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
tbat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
thand and runs for the backroom.

tBehind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
tground.

tTen bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
twho are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
tback room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
tugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
tdoor as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
tas they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
thowls and snaps in fury.

tSeth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
t.45 in its big mouth.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou wanna suck something, suck on
ttthis!

tHe FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
tthe wall.

tKate yells:

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttWe have to go back for Daddy!

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttDaddy's dead.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttNoooo!

tShe spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
tand help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
tagainst the wall.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttHe's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
tttoo far away. If flinging that door
ttand filling this room with those
ttbat-things would save him, I'd fling
ttit. The only thing it'll do is turn us
ttinto one of them.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttHe needs our help!

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttHe's beyond our help. You saw him get
ttbit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
ttYou can't help him. I've got no one
ttleft to lose but you. I can't be alone
ttagain. We're sticking together.

tJust then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.


<b>tINT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tJacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
tappropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
tbay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
trestored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
this way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
tthe bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

tThe creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
tholiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
twhirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
tin front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
tgod. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
tstake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
tin a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
tAs he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
tlying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
tcandy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
trepugnant sight trip him up.

tJacob has backed himself up by the door.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttOpen the door.

tThe door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
tshut.

tJacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
tbloody arm.

tWhen he releases them, they can't help but notice.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttDid he...?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttYep.

tSeth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
tover tables and cussing a blue streak.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttFuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
ttvampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
ttGoddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

tSeth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
tcreatures on the other side.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
ttgonna fuckin' kill every last one of
ttyou godless pieces of shit!

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttt(to Seth)
ttYou bet your sweet ass you are, and
ttI'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
ttgot much time.

tKate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttYou're gonna be okay, aren't you,
ttdaddy?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNo, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
ttI'm already dead.

tScott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
tdear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
tkids will never have the courage for what they must do.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttt(to his children)
ttChildren, listen to me. I love you two
ttmore than anybody. And I just want you 
ttto know you've made me proud all your
ttlives. But never more so than tonight.
ttAnd I wish we could sit here and cry
tttill I pass on, but we can't. Because
ttI'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
ttturn into a monster. And when I do,
ttI'm going to be dangerous. But before
ttthat happens, just know I love you.
ttt(to Seth and the kids)
ttNow, I'd say in the next twenty or
ttthirty minutes our friends outside
ttwill bust in this door. And I'll
ttprobably turn into a vampire within
ttthe hour. Now, you have two choices.
ttYou can wait for me to turn, then deal
ttwith me, then wait for them to burst
ttinside here and the three of you will
ttdeal with them. Or, we can kick open
ttthat door and the four of us can hit
tt'em with everything we have, and carve
tta path right through 'em to front
ttentrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
ttwe gotta go at 'em now. I confused
ttthem, I scared them, I took them off
ttguard. But they're going to get
ttunconfused, they're going to get
ttunscared, they're going to get
tttogether and they're going to hit that
ttdoor like a ton of bricks. And when
ttthat moment arrives, we gotta be
ttready.

tJacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
twith boxes and crates.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttWhat's this stuff?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttMy guess is that this little dive's
ttbeen feeding on nomad road waifs like
ttbikers and truckers for a longtime.
ttThis is probably some of the
ttshipments they stole off the trucks.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttWell, I say lets tear this place apart
ttfor weapons. So when they burst
ttthrough that door, we'll make 'em wish
ttthey never did.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI don't give a shit about living or
ttdying anymore. I just want to send as
ttmany of these devils back to hell as
ttI can.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttAmen.

<b>tMONTAGE
</b>
tThe survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
tlot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
tteddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
tdoctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
ta shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
tare a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
tballoons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
tshipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

tSeth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

tKate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
tbackroom sink.

tJacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
tin the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

tVampires all start converging on the back room door,
tgetting their courage back.

tKate makes water balloons.

tScott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
tattaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

tJacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
tturning it into holy water.

tOur heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
tThe back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
tbegins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
tThe room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
tpounding, squeaking and screaming.

tFinally they're ready.

tJacob turns to his kids.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttBefore we go any further, I need you
ttthree to promise me something. I'll
ttfight with you to the bitter end,
ttbut when I turn into one of them, I
ttwon't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
ttlap dog of Satan. I want you three to
ttpromise you'll take me down, no
ttdifferent from the rest.

tThe kids can't say the words.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI promise.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttKate, Scott?

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttI promise.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttScott?

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttYeah, I promise.

tJacob doesn't believe them.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttWhy don't I believe you?
ttt(he picks up the .45)
ttI'm gonna ask you two again, then I
ttwant you to swear to God that you'll
ttkill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
ttjust kill myself right now. Now,
ttsince you need me I think you better
ttswear. Kate, do you swear to God
ttthat when I turn into one of the
ttundead, you'll kill me?

tKate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
ttemple.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttKate, we don't have all day, so I'm
ttonly gonna count to five. One...two...
ttthree... four...

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttOkay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNot good enough, swear to God.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttI swear to God, our father, that when
ttyou change into one of the undead, I
ttwill kill you.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttGood girl. Now, Scott, we have even
ttless time, so I'm only giving you the
ttcount of three. One...

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttYou don't believe in suicide.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttIt's not suicide if you're already
ttdead. Two...

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttOkay, I'll kill you when you change,
ttI swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttThank you, son.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttOkay, vampire killers, let's kill some
ttfuckin' vampires.


<b>tINT. BARROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tThe vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
tdown the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
tthe door.

tWaiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
tand water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
tgrenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
tstakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
tthe jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
tinto the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

tWhat we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
tBunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
twatch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
tlike the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
tstarting up the jackhammer.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttKill 'em all!

tJacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

tThe kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
tflesh.

tThe pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
tforward.

tThey are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
tthe door.

tSeth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
tin and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
tgreen vamp blood.

tJacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
tand SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
tother.

tFlame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

tKate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
ttoss them into the crowd.

tThey burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
tin pain.

tFrom its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
tHURLS toward the group.

tJacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

tThe bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

tSeth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
tthe hammer stake into vampire chests.

tThe front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
tjunk.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttWhy did they block the door again?

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttTo keep the daylight out! This is
ttwhere they sleep! Get to the door!

tSeth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
thalf bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
tabove in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
tSex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
toff the ground.

tSeth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
the CRASHES into a table.

tThe Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
tsticking out of his chest, dead.

tKate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
tscreams:

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttSeth!

tSeth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
ton all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttOkay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
ttand feel all right!

tKate clusters with her father and Scott.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttI'm going for 'em!

<b>ttttJACOB
</b>ttNo!

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttEverybody goes home!

tKate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
tone-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
tSeth's direction.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttt(screaming)
ttDie, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

tKate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
tburning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
tcouple of water balloons and a stake.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttt(to Seth)
ttWatch my back!

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttAnytime.

tCutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
tbar.

tJacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
tfiery death.

tScott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

tAs Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
tcan't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
tto hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
tvampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
thappy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
tHis eyes are yellow.

tScott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

tJacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
tsinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
tmurder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

tScott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
tSMASHES it against Jacob's head.

tThe holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
tof Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

tScott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
tup to fire.

tA totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
twith the boy he once called his son.

tScott's eyes turn to steel.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttI swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
ttname.

tHe FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
tcreating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
thead bursts into flames, then explodes.

tFrom across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
tcries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttFight now, cry later.

tKate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
twith a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

tA bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
tit bites into him. He drops the .45.

tKate sees Scott get bit.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttOh my god.

tAnother bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
tScott screams.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttYou bastards!

tShe goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

tNow seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
tScott is in agony.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttKill me, Kate! 

tKate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
tup by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
ttimes.

tOne... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
tall of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

tThe remaining vamps approach.

tAll the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
tballoon.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttHow many bullets left, kid?

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttNot many.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWell, when you run out of weapons,
ttjust start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
ttsing for their supper.

tThe two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
tthings do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
tthrows the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
tbat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

tThe two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
tthem. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
tholding the .45, arm outstretched.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttt(to Seth)
ttShould I use the last bullets on us?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou use 'em on the first couple of
ttthese parasites that try to bite you.

tThe vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
ton the face of an approaching vampire.

tSeth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
tvampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

tBeams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
tthrough the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
tvamps scream like they've never screamed before.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttShoot more holes!

tKate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
tbehind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
tSeth with a safe, lighted area.

tThe .45's empty.

tThe vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
table to get at them.

tThe two survivors hold hands, when...

tAll of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
tfrom the outside.

tThe vamps look towards it in horror.

tFrom the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
tSpanish accent.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttt(in Spanish)
ttI'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
ttthere?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttCarlos!
ttt(in Spanish)
ttHelp us, bash the door. Bash the door
ttin!

<b>ttttCARLOS (O.S.)
</b>ttt(in Spanish)
ttDanny, Manny, knock down the door.
ttHurry, hurry!

tThe vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
taround the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
teach other.

tThe front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
tthe outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
tdoor.

tThe table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

tThe door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
tare instantly fried, bursting into flames.

tThe Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
tMANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
tin fright.

tVampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
thits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
thundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
tVamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
tcombust in fiery explosions.

tThe Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

tSeth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
tdoor into the parking lot.


<b>tEXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING
</b>
tCarlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
tthem away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
tCarlos's Mercedes.

<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttt(to Seth)
ttWhat the fuck was going on in there?

tSeth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
tbreath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
tkisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttt(in Spanish)
ttWhatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWhy the fuck, outta all the god
ttforsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
tthave us rendezvous at that place?

<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttI don't know, one place's as good as
ttanother.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttHave you ever been there before?

<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttNo, but I passed by it a couple of
tttimes. It's out in the middle of
ttnowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
ttso there wouldn't be a lot of police.
ttAnd it's open from dusk till dawn.
ttYou said meet you in the morning.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttWell, because you picked that place
ttout of a hat, my brother's dead now.
ttAnd this girl's family's dead.

tCarlos stands up again.

<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttI'm sorry to hear that. What were
ttthey, psychos?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttDid they look like psychos? They
ttwere fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
ttexplode when sunlight hits 'em, I
ttdon't care how crazy they are.

tDanny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
tthemselves again.

<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttOh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
ttto you?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttYou can't, but fifteen percent instead
ttof thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
ttgood start.

<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttTwenty-eight.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttJesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
ttdead and he's not coming back, and
ttit's all your fault. Twenty.


tThey look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

<b>ttttSETH AND CARLOS
</b>ttt(in Spanish)
ttTwenty-five.

tSeth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
tto a red 1990 Porsche 911.


<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttYou like the car?

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI said new, this is an '90.

<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttIt's hardly been used at all. I got it
ttfrom a drug dealer who only drove it 5
tttimes in as many years. Swear to God.
ttThat's like new.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttSo do I just follow you?

<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttYeah, follow us.


<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttSo let's do it.

<b>ttttCARLOS
</b>ttt(to Danny and Manny)
ttVamanos!

tCarlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

tSeth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

tKate stands alone.

tThe whole desert seems between them.

tSo much to say ... but no words.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttI'm sorry.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttMe too.

tLong pause.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttSee ya.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttLater.

tSeth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
tsays behind him:

<b>ttttKATE (O.S.)
</b>ttSeth.

tSeth turns around.

<b>ttttKATE
</b>ttYou want some company?

tSeth smiles.

<b>ttttSETH
</b>ttKate honey, I may be a bastard. But
ttI'm not a fuckin' bastard.

tHe blows her a kiss across the desert.

tShe blows one back.

tSeth's in his car and GONE.

tKate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
tbegins her long walk home.
