<pre>

<b>tttTHE BIG LEBOWSKI
</b>
We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices 
gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, 
Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

<b>ttttVOICE-OVER
</b>ttA way out west there was a fella, 
ttfella I want to tell you about, fella 
ttby the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At 
ttleast, that was the handle his lovin' 
ttparents gave him, but he never had 
ttmuch use for it himself.  This 
ttLebowski, he called himself the Dude.  
ttNow, Dude, that's a name no one would 
ttself-apply where I come from.  But 
ttthen, there was a lot about the Dude 
ttthat didn't make a whole lot of sense 
ttto me.  And a lot about where he 
ttlived, like- wise.  But then again, 
ttmaybe that's why I found the place 
tts'durned innarestin'.

We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at 
twilight stretches out before us.

<b>ttttVOICE-OVER
</b>ttThey call Los Angeles the City of 
ttAngels.  I didn't find it to be that 
ttexactly, but I'll allow as there are 
ttsome nice folks there.  'Course, I 
ttcan't say I seen London, and I never 
ttbeen to France, and I ain't never 
ttseen no queen in her damn undies as 
ttthe fella says.  But I'll tell you 
ttwhat, after seeing Los Angeles and 
ttthisahere story I'm about to unfold--
ttwal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' 
ttbit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any 
tta those other places, and in English 
tttoo, so I can die with a smile on my 
ttface without feelin' like the good 
ttLord gypped me.

<b>INTERIOR   RALPH'S
</b>
It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking 
in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the 
dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed 
manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.

He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their 
expiration dates.

<b>ttttVOICE-OVER
</b>ttNow this story I'm about to unfold 
tttook place back in the early nineties--
ttjust about the time of our conflict 
ttwith Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I 
ttonly mention it 'cause some- times 
ttthere's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 
tt'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes 
ttthere's a man.

The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of 
milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.

<b>ttttVOICE-OVER
</b>ttAnd I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- 
ttsometimes there's a man who, wal, 
tthe's the man for his time'n place, 
tthe fits right in there--and that's 
ttthe Dude, in Los Angeles.

<b>CHECKOUT GIRL
</b>
She waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to 
her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with 
helicopter rotors spinning behind him.

<b>ttttGEORGE BUSH
</b>ttThis aggression will not stand. . . 
ttThis will not stand!

The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at 
the little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache.

<b>ttttVOICE-OVER
</b>tt...and even if he's a lazy man, and 
ttthe Dude was certainly that--quite 
ttpossibly the laziest in Los Angeles 
ttCounty.

The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and 
is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.

<b>ttttVOICE-OVER
</b>tt...which would place him high in the 
ttrunnin' for laziest worldwide--but 
ttsometimes there's a man. . . sometimes 
ttthere's a man.

<b>EXTERIOR  RALPH'S
</b>
Long shot of the glowing Ralph's.  There are only two or 
three cars parked in the huge lot.

<b>ttttVOICE-OVER
</b>ttWal, I lost m'train of thought here.  
ttBut--aw hell, I done innerduced him 
ttenough.

The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.  
Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and 
cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.  
The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.

After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIt's the LeBaron.

<b>DUDE'S HOUSE
</b>
The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow 
court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small 
leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the 
grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.

<b>INSIDE
</b>
The Dude enters and flicks on a light.

His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.  
We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, 
his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.  
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece 
of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a 
hole.

The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small 
bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of 
doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper 
bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet 
rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the 
floor.

The Dude blows bubbles.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWe want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny 
ttsaid you were good for it.

Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and 
gasps for air.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhere's the money, Lebowski!

His head is plunged back into the toilet.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhere's the money, Lebowski!

The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b><b>ttWHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIt's uh, it's down there somewhere.  
ttLemme take another look.

His head is plunged back in.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDon't fuck with us.  If your wife 
ttowes money to Jackie Treehorn, that 
ttmeans you owe money to Jackie 
ttTreehorn.

The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and 
flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against 
the toilet.

The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.

Looming over him is a strapping blond man.

Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly 
and walks over to a rug.

<b>ttttCHINESE MAN
</b>ttEver thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

He starts peeing on the rug.

The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his 
sunglasses.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOh, man.  Don't do--

<b>ttttBLOND MAN
</b>ttYou see what happens?  You see what 
tthappens, Lebowski?

The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttLook, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You 
ttgot the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude, 
ttman.

<b>ttttBLOND MAN
</b>ttYour name is Lebowski.  Your wife is 
ttBunny.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttBunny?  Look, moron.

He holds up his hands.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou see a wedding ring?  Does this 
ttplace look like I'm fucking married?   
ttAll my plants are dead!

The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a 
bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious 
native.

<b>ttttBLOND MAN
</b>ttThe fuck is this?

The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights 
it.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttObviously you're not a golfer.

The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.

<b>ttttBLOND MAN
</b>ttWoo?

The Chinese man is zipping his fly.

<b>ttttWOO
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttBLOND MAN
</b>ttWasn't this guy supposed to be a 
ttmillionaire?

<b>ttttWOO
</b>ttUh?

They both look around.

<b>ttttWOO
</b>ttFuck.

<b>ttttBLOND MAN
</b>ttWhat do you think?

<b>ttttWOO
</b>ttHe looks like a fuckin' loser.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger 
and peeks over them.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHey.  At least I'm housebroken.

The two men look at each other.  They turn to leave.

<b>ttttWOO
</b>ttFuckin' waste of time.

The blond man turns testily at the door.

<b>ttttBLOND MAN
</b>ttThanks a lot, asshole.

<b>tttttt ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:
</b>
<b>BOWLING PINS
</b>
Scattered by a strike.

Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins 
flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes, 
sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a 
ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.

The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant 
jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.

A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail 
turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttHot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.  
ttMark it, Dude.

We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man 
nursing a large plastic cup of Bud.  He has dark worried 
eyes and a goatee.  Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.  
He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves 
cut off over an old bowling shirt.  This is Walter.  He 
squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he 
addresses the Dude at the scoring table.

The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears 
some of its foam on his mustache.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThis was a valued rug.

He elaborately clears his throat.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThis was, uh--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah man, it really tied the room 
tttogether--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThis was a valued, uh.

Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWhat tied the room together, Dude?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWere you listening to the story, 
ttDonny?

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWhat--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWere you listening to the Dude's 
ttstory?

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttI was bowling--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttSo you have no frame of reference, 
ttDonny.  You're like a child who 
ttwanders in in the middle of a movie 
ttand wants to know--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhat's your point, Walter?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThere's no fucking reason--here's my 
ttpoint, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttYeah Walter, what's your point?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhat's the point of--we all know who 
ttwas at fault, so what the fuck are 
ttyou talking about?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHuh?  No!  What the fuck are you 
tttalking--I'm not--we're talking about 
ttunchecked aggression here--

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWhat the fuck is he talking about?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttMy rug.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttForget it, Donny.  You're out of 
ttyour element.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThis Chinaman who peed on my rug, I 
ttcan't go give him a bill so what the 
ttfuck are you talking about?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat the fuck are you talking about?!  
ttThis Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm 
tttalking about drawing a line in the 
ttsand, Dude.  Across this line you do 
ttnot, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is 
ttnot the preferred, uh. . . Asian- 
ttAmerican.  Please.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, this is not a guy who built 
ttthe rail- roads, here, this is a guy 
ttwho peed on my--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat the fuck are you--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, he peed on my rug--

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttHe peed on the Dude's rug--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This 
ttChinaman is not the issue, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttSo who--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttJeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other 
ttJeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.  
ttHe's gonna be easier to find anyway 
ttthan these two, uh. these two  . . . 
ttAnd he has the wealth, uh, the 
ttresources obviously, and there is no 
ttreason, no FUCKING reason, why his 
ttwife should go out and owe money and 
ttthey pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNo, but--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAm I wrong!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, but--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttOkay. That, uh.

He elaborately clears his throat.

That rap really tied the room together, did it not?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFuckin' A.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttAnd this guy peed on it.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDonny!  Please!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttHis name is Lebowski?  That's your 
ttname, Dude!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, this is the guy, this guy should 
ttcompensate me for the fucking rug.  
ttI mean his wife goes out and owes 
ttmoney and they pee on my rug.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThaaat's right Dude; they pee on 
ttyour fucking Rug.

<b>CLOSE ON A PLAQUE
</b>
We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver 
to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, 
honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.

Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room 
with a YOUNG MAN.  We hear the two men talk:

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttAnd this is the study.  You can see 
ttthe various commendations, honorary 
ttdegrees, et cetera.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYes, uh, very impressive.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttPlease, feel free to inspect them.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI'm not really, uh.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttPlease!  Please!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttUh-huh.

We are panning the walls, looking at various citations and

certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen:

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttThat's the key to the city of 
ttPasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was 
ttgiven two years ago in recognition 
ttof his various civic, uh.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttThat's a Los Angeles Chamber of 
ttCommerce Business Achiever award, 
ttwhich is given--not necessarily given 
ttevery year!  Given only when there's 
tta worthy, somebody especially--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHey, is this him with Nancy?

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttThat is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the 
ttfirst lady, yes, taken when--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttLebowski on the right?

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttOf course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, 
ttMrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHe's handicapped, huh?

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttMr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And 
ttthis picture was taken when Mrs. 
ttReagan was first lady of the nation, 
ttyes, yes? Not of California.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFar out.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttAnd in fact he met privately with 
ttthe President, though unfortunately 
ttthere wasn't time for a photo 
ttopportunity.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNancy's pretty good.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttWonderful woman.  We were very--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAre these.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttThese are Mr. Lebowski's children, 
ttso to speak--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttDifferent mothers, huh?

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttNo, they--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI guess he's pretty, uh, racially 
ttpretty cool--

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttThey're not his, heh-heh, they're 
ttnot literally his children; they're 
ttthe Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
ttinner-city children of promise but 
ttwithout the--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI see.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>tt--without  the means  for higher  
tteducation, so Mr. Lebowski  has 
ttcommitted  to sending  all of them 
ttto college.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJeez.  Think he's got room for one 
ttmore?

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttOne--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went 
ttto college?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell, yeah I did, but I spent most 
ttof my time occupying various, um, 
ttadministration buildings--

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttHeh-heh--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt--smoking thai-stick, breaking into 
ttthe ROTC--

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttYes, heh--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt--and bowling.  I'll tell you the 
tttruth, Brandt, I don't remember most 
ttof it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed 
Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI 
ACHIEVER?  Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we 
realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the 
display is mirrored.

We hear the door open and the whine of a motor.  The Dude, 
wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.

So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.  He 
wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.

Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized 
wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttOkay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a 
ttLebowski, that's terrific, I'm very 
ttbusy so what can I do for you?

He wheels himself behind a desk.  The Dude sits facing him 
as Brandt withdraws.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell sir, it's this rug I have, really 
tttied the room together-

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttYou told Brandt on the phone, he 
tttold me.  So where do I fit in?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell they were looking for you, these 
tttwo guys, they were trying to--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttI'll say it again, all right?  You 
tttold Brandt.  He told me.  I know 
ttwhat happened. Yes?  Yes?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttSo you know they were trying to piss 
tton your rug--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttDid I urinate on your rug?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou mean, did you personally come 
ttand pee on my--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttHello!  Do you speak English?  Parla 
ttusted Inglese?  I'll say it again.  
ttDid I urinate on your rug?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell no, like I said, Woo peed on 
ttthe rug--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttHello!  Hello!  So every time--I 
ttjust want to understand this, sir--
ttevery time a rug is micturated upon 
ttin this fair city, I have to 
ttcompensate the--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttCome on, man, I'm not trying to scam 
ttanybody here, I'm just--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttYou're just looking for a handout 
ttlike every other--are you employed, 
ttMr. Lebowski?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttLook, let me explain something.   
ttI'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. 
ttLebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's  
ttwhat  you  call me.  That, or Duder. 
ttHis  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,  
ttyou know, you're not into the whole 
ttbrevity thing--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttAre you employed, sir?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttEmployed?

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttYou don't go out and make a living 
ttdressed like that in the middle of a 
ttweekday.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIs this a--what day is this?

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttBut I do work, so if you don't mind--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNo, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.  
ttThis will not stand, ya know, this 
ttwill not stand, man.  I mean, if 
ttyour wife owes--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttMy wife is not the issue here. I 
tthope that my wife will someday learn 
ttto live on her allowance, which is 
ttample, but if she doesn't, sir, that 
ttwill be her problem, not mine, just 
ttas your rug is your problem, just as 
ttevery bum's lot in life is his own 
ttresponsibility regardless of whom he 
ttchooses to blame.  I didn't blame 
ttanyone for the loss of my legs, some 
ttchinaman in Korea took them from me 
ttbut I went out and achieved anyway.  
ttI can't solve your problems, sir, 
ttonly you can.

The Dude rises.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAh fuck it.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttSure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!  
ttTattoo it on your forehead!  Your 
ttanswer to everything!

The Dude is heading for the door.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttYour "revolution" is over, Mr.  
ttLebowski!  Condolences!  The bums 
ttlost!

As the Dude opens the door.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>tt...My advice is, do what your parents 
ttdid!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will 
ttalways lose-- do you hear me, 
ttLebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--

The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find 
himself--

<b>ttttHALLWAY
</b>tt--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt 
ttis approaching.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttHow was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOkay.  The old man told me to take 
ttany rug in the house.

<b>WALKWAY
</b>
A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down 
a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming 
pool to a garage.  Brandt and the Dude follow.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttManolo will load it into your car 
ttfor you, uh, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIt's the LeBaron.

<b>DUDE'S POINT OF VIEW
</b>
Tracking toward the pool.  A young woman sits facing it, her 
back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails.

Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the 
pool.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttWell, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see 
ttyou again some time, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah sure, if I'm ever in the 
ttneighborhood, need to use the john.

<b>CLOSER TRACK
</b>
Arcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the 
nails emerald green.

<b>THE DUDE
</b>
Looking.

<b>WIDER
</b>
The young woman looks up at him.  She is in her early 
twenties.

She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude.

<b>ttttYOUNG WOMAN
</b>ttBlow on them.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over 
them.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?

She waggles her foot and giggles.

<b>ttttYOUNG WOMAN
</b>ttG'ahead.  Blow.

The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou want me to blow on your toes?

<b>ttttYOUNG WOMAN
</b>ttUh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.

The Dude looks over at the pool.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou sure he won't mind?

The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out.  He 
is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair.  He 
wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, 
shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin.  
One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty 
whiskey bottle bobs.

<b>ttttYOUNG WOMAN
</b>ttDieter doesn't care about anything.  
ttHe's a nihilist.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttPracticing?

The young woman smiles.

<b>ttttYOUNG WOMAN
</b>ttYou're not blowing.

Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttOur guest has to be getting along, 
ttMrs.  Lebowski.

The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still 
looking at the young woman.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou're Bunny?

<b>ttttBUNNY
</b>ttI'll suck your cock for a thousand 
ttdollars.

Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter:

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttHa-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very 
ttfree-spirited.  We're all very fond 
ttof her.

<b>ttttBUNNY
</b>ttBrandt can't watch though.  Or he 
tthas to pay a hundred.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttHa-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.

He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his

<b>SHOULDER:

</b>ttI'm just gonna find a cash machine.

<b>BOWLING PINS
</b>
Scattered by a strike.

<b>THE BOWLERS
</b>
Donny calls out from the bench:

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttGrasshopper Dude--They're dead in 
ttthe water!!

As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to 
another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that 
shares the lane.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYour maples, Carl.

Walter, just arriving, is carrying a leatherette satchel in 
one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWay to go, Dude.  If you will it, it 
ttis no dream.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou're fucking twenty minutes late.  
ttWhat the fuck is that?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttTheodore Herzel.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttState of Israel.  If you will it, 
ttDude, it is no--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhat the fuck're you talking about?  
ttThe carrier.  What's in the fucking 
ttcarrier?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHuh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
ttCan't leave him home alone or he 
tteats the furniture.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhat the fuck are you--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
ttI'm looking after it while Cynthia 
ttand Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou brought a fucking Pomeranian 
ttbowling?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat do you mean "brought it bowling"?  
ttI didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not 
ttbuying it a fucking beer.  He's not 
ttgonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier.  It scoots 
around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging 
its tail.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked 
ttme to take care of her fucking dog 
ttwhile she and her boyfriend went to 
ttHonolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck 
ttherself.  Why can't she board it?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFirst of all, Dude, you don't have 
ttan ex, secondly, it's a fucking show 
ttdog with fucking papers.  You can't 
ttboard it.  It gets upset, its hair 
ttfalls out.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHey man--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over 
ttthe line!

Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttSmokey Huh?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttOver the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.  
ttThat's a foul.

<b>ttttSMOKEY
</b>ttBullshit.  Eight, Dude.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttExcuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.

<b>ttttSMOKEY
</b>ttBullshit. Walter!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThis is not Nam.  This is bowling.  
ttThere are rules.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttCome on Walter, it's just--it's 
ttSmokey.  So his toe slipped over a 
ttlittle, it's just a game.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThis is a league game.  This 
ttdetermines who enters the next round-
ttrobin, am I wrong?

<b>ttttSMOKEY
</b>ttYeah, but--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAm I wrong!?

<b>ttttSMOKEY
</b>ttYeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the 
ttmarker, Dude,  I'm marking it an 
tteight.

Walter takes out a gun.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttSmokey my friend, you're entering a 
ttworld of pain.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHey Walter--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttMark that frame an eight, you're 
ttentering a world of pain.

<b>ttttSMOKEY
</b>ttI'm not--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttA world of pain.

A manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a 
phone.

<b>ttttSMOKEY
</b>ttLook Dude, I don't hold with this.  
ttThis guy is your partner, you should--

Walter primes the gun and points it at his head.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttHAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM 
</b><b>ttI THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT 
</b><b>ttABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO!
</b>
The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making 
high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, they're calling the cops, 
ttput the piece away.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttMARK IT ZERO!
</b>
<b>ttttSMOKEY
</b>ttWalter--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttYOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?  
</b><b>ttMARK IT ZERO!!
</b>
<b>ttttSMOKEY
</b>ttAll right!  There it is!  It's fucking 
ttzero!

He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.

<b>ttttSMOKEY
</b>ttYou happy, you crazy fuck?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThis is a league game, Smokey!

<b>PARKING LOT
</b>
Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car.  The Pomeranian 
trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, you can't do that.  These 
ttguys're like me, they're pacificists.  
ttSmokey was a conscientious objector.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYou know Dude, I myself dabbled with 
ttpacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, 
ttof course--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAnd you know Smokey has emotional 
ttproblems!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYou mean--beyond pacifism?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHe's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

As the two men get into the car:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHuh.  I did not know that.  Well, 
ttit's water under the bridge.  And we 
ttdo enter the next round-robin, am I 
ttwrong?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNo, you're not wrong--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAm I wrong!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou're not wrong, Walter, you're 
ttjust an asshole.

They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttOkay then.  We play Quintana and 
ttO'Brien next week.  They'll be 
ttpushovers.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJust, just take it easy, Walter.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThat's your answer to everything, 
ttDude.  And let me point out--pacifism 
ttis not--look at our current situation 
ttwith that camelfucker in Iraq--
ttpacifism is not something to hide 
ttbehind.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell, just take 't easy, man.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI'm perfectly calm, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(smugly)
ttCalmer than you are.

-his irritates the Dude further.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJust take it easy, man!

Walter is still smug.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttCalmer than you are.

<b>DUDE'S HOUSE
</b>
A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-
up old furniture.

At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing 
kalhua, rum and milk.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't 
ttwanna be a hard-on about this, and I 
ttknow it wasn't your fault, but I 
ttjust thought it was fair to tell you 
ttthat Gene and I will be submitting

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttShit!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tt--so, like I say, just thought, you

A beep.

<b>ttttANOTHER VOICE
</b>ttMr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh,

ttPlease call us as soon as is

ttI just got a, an informal report, 
ttuh, that a uh, a member of your team, 
ttuh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded

We hear the doorbell.

<b>THE DOOR
</b>
It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding 
middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHiya Allan.

<b>ttttALLAN
</b>ttDude, I finally got the venue I 
ttwanted.  I'm Performing my dance

The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua.

</b>ttDude, uh, tomorrow is already the

</b>ttJust, uh, just slip the rent under

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, okay.

<b>BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM
</b>
The  voice continues on the machine.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tt--serious infraction, and examine 
ttyour standing.  Thank you.  Beep.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttMr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please 
ttdo call us when you get in and I'll

ttyou, is not a problem.  We need your

ttmuch like to see you.  Thank you.  
ttIt's Brandt.

<b>TRACKING
</b>
We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway.  
Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano.  Brandt talks back 
over

<b>HIS SHOULDER:
</b>
<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttWe've had some terrible news.  Mr. 
ttLebowski is in seclusion in the West 
ttWing.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh.

Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors.  The music 
washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey 
Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly 
into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.

<b>BRANDT ANNOUNCES, AMBIGUOUSLY:
</b>
<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttMr. Lebowski.

Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttIt's funny.  I can look back on a 
ttlife of achievement, on challenges 
ttmet, competitors bested, obstacles 
ttovercome.  I've accomplished more 
ttthan most men, and without the use 
ttof my legs.  What. . . What makes a 
ttman, Mr. Lebowski?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttDude.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI don't know, sir.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttIs it. . . is it, being prepared to 
ttdo the right thing?  Whatever the 
ttprice?  Isn't that what makes a man?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttSure.  That and a pair of testicles.

Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost 
in thought.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttYou're joking.  But perhaps you're 
ttright.

The Dude thumps at his chest pocket.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttMind if I smoke a jay?

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttBunny.

He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on 
his cheeks.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt'Scuse me?

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttBunny Lebowski. . . She is the light 
ttof my life.  Are you surprised at my 
tttears, sir?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFuckin' A.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttStrong men also cry. . . Strong men 
ttalso cry.

He clears his throat.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttI received this fax this morning.

Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and 
hands it to the Dude.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttAs you can see, it is a ransom note.  
ttSent by cowards.  Men who are unable 
ttto achieve on a level field of play.  
ttMen who will not sign their names.  
ttWeaklings.  Bums.

<b>THE DUDE EXAMINES THE FAX:
</b>
<b>WE HAVE BUNNY.  GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON-
</b><b>CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES.  AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.  NO FUNNY STUFF.
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttBummer.

Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttBrandt will fill you in on the 
ttdetails.

He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire.  
Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the 
hall.

<b>HALLWAY
</b>
The soprano's singing is once again faint.  Brandt's voice 
is hushed:

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttMr. Lebowski is prepared to make a 
ttgenerous offer to you to act as 
ttcourier once we get instructions for 
ttthe money.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhy me, man?

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttHe suspects that the culprits might 
ttbe the very people who, uh, soiled 
ttyour rug, and you're in a unique 
ttposition to confirm or, uh, disconfirm 
ttthat suspicion.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttSo he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, 
tthuh?

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttWell Dude, we just don't know.

<b>BOWLING PINS
</b>
CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Still in slow motion.  We are looking across the length of 
the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying 
perfect form.  He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch 
bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side.

<b>FAST TRACK IN
</b>
On the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic 
chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFucking Quintana--that creep can 
ttroll, man--

<b>BACK TO THE BOWLER
</b>
Displaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's 
conversation continues over.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah, but he's a fucking pervert, 
ttDude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThe man is a sex offender.  With a 
ttrecord.  Spent six months in Chino 
ttfor exposing himself to an eight-
ttyear-old.

<b>FLASHBACK
</b>
We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater,  
walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging 
the bell.

The VOICE-OVER conversation continues.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhen he moved down to Venice he had 
ttto go door-to-door to tell everyone 
tthe's a pederast.

The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man 
looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWhat's a pederast, Walter?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShut the fuck up, Donny.

<b>PINS
</b>
scattered by a strike.

<b>QUINTANA
</b>
wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air.

Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his 
first name, "Jesus".

<b>BACK TO WALTER AND THE DUDE
</b>
They have been joined by Donny.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAnyway.  How much they offer you?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttTwenty grand.  And of course I still 
ttkeep the rug.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttJust for making the hand-off?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah.

He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so  
ttwhenever these guys call--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat if it's during a game?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI told him if it was during league 
ttplay--

Donny has been watching Quintana.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttIf what's during league play?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttLife does not stop and start at your 
ttconvenience, you miserable piece of 
ttshit.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWhat's wrong with Walter, Dude?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI figure it's easy money, it's all 
ttpretty harmless.  I mean she probably 
ttkidnapped herself.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWhat do you mean, Dude?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttRug-peers did not do this.  I mean 
ttlook at it.  Young trophy wife.  
ttMarries a guy for money but figures 
tthe isn't giving her enough.  She

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThat...fucking...bitch!

</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttI am the Walrus.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!  
ttVladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWhat the fuck is he talking about?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThat's fucking exactly what happened, 
ttDude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, well, what do you care, Walter?

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttYeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed 
ttoff?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThose rich fucks!  This whole fucking

ttdie face down in the muck so that 
ttthis fucking strumpet--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI don't see any connection to Vietnam, 
ttWalter.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWell, there isn't a literal 
ttconnection, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, face it, there isn't any

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHave it your way.  The point is--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIt's your roll--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThe fucking point is--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIt's your roll.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAre you ready to be fucked, man?

They both look up.

Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of 
the lanes.  Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a 
windbreaker with a racing stripe and "Jesus" stitched on the 
breast.  He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball 
satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein).  Behind him stands his 
partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.

<b>ttttQUINTANA
</b>ttI see you rolled your way into the 
ttsemis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and 
ttme, we're gonna fuck you up.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah well, that's just, ya know, 
ttlike, your opinion, man.

Quintana looks at Walter.

<b>ttttQUINTANA
</b>ttLet me tell you something, bendeco.  
ttYou pull any your crazy shit with 
ttus, you flash a piece out on the 
ttlanes, I'll take it away from you 
ttand stick it up your ass and pull 
ttthe fucking trigger til it goes 
tt"click".

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJesus.

<b>ttttQUINTANA
</b>ttYou said it, man.  Nobody fucks with 
ttthe Jesus.

Jesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttEight-year-olds, Dude.

<b>DUDE'S BUNGALOW
</b>
We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug.  
His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an 
intermittent clatter.

In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE 
<b>BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987.
</b>
The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall 
rumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the 
Dude opens his eyes.

He screams.

A blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man  
in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards 
the carrier.

The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head 
thunking back onto the rug.

A million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear 
the "La-la-la-la" of The Man in Me.

The black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug.   
The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of 
Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.

The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in 
front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his 
bowling shirt. He looks up.

Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the 
Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing 
us, growing smaller.

The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices 
that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.  
His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic 
implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its 
weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He 
is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down 
toward the city, dragged by the ball.

A  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us 
out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by  
the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in 
black.

We hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections 
materialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny 
surface of an oncoming bowling ball.

We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of 
a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being 
regurgitated up at us, overtaking us.

The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass 
rolling a huge shadow across his face.

The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward 
us --finger holes.

The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing 
us once again in black..

The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a 
bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in 
the thumbhole of the rolling ball.

We see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde 
woman, performing her follow-through.

Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and 
away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; 
ceiling; approaching pins; again and again.

We hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins 
spin, hit each other and drop.

We hear an irritating, insistent beeping.

<b>FADE IN
</b>
We are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades 
in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint.  
They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is 
now askew, with one arm off his ear.

As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put 
him right side around.  His head is now resting against 
hardwood floor, not rug.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOh man.

He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the  
red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is  
blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps.

<b>WIDE ON THE ROOM
</b>
An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is  
in place. The rug is gone.

The  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue.   
The beeps continue.

The phone starts to jangle.

<b>TRACK
</b>
We  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway.   
Again  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a  
wrist to  look at  his watch.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttThey called about eighty minutes 
ttago.  They want you to take the money 
ttand drive north on the 4 5.  They'll 
ttcall you on the portable phone with 
ttinstructions in about forty minutes.  
ttOne person only or I'd go with you.  
ttThey were very clear on that: one 
ttperson only.  What happened to your 
ttjaw?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOh, nothin', you know.

They have reached the little desk outside of the big 
Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key 
and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude 
along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttHere's the money, and the phone.  
ttPlease, Dude, follow whatever 
ttinstructions they give.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttHer life is in your hands.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOh, man, don't say that..

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttMr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:  
ttHer life is in your hands.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttShit.

<b>ttttBRANDT

<b>DUDE'S CAR
</b>
We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through 
the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter 
standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK 
SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the 
fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look 
oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape 
bundled in brown wrapping paper.

The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door 
and hands in the briefcase.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttTake the ringer.  I'll drive.

The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThe what?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThe ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have 
ttthey called yet?

The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it 
as the car starts rolling.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhat the hell is this?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttMy dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.  
ttThe whites.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAgh--

He closes the briefcase.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, I'm sure there's a reason 
ttyou brought your dirty undies--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.  
ttThe ringer can't look empty.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter--what the fuck are you 
ttthinking?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWell you're right, Dude, I got to 
ttthinking.  I got to thinking why 
ttshould we settle for a measly fucking 
tttwenty grand--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWe?  What the fuck we?  You said you 
ttjust wanted to come along--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttMy point, Dude, is why should we 
ttsettle for twenty grand when we can 
ttkeep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYes you're wrong.  This isn't a 
ttfucking game, Walter--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttIt is a fucking game.  You said so 
ttyourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

<b>ttttDUDE '
</b>ttYeah, but--

The phone chirps.  Dude grabs it.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttDude here.

ttWho is this?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttDude the Bagman.  Where do you want

</b>ttShut the fuck up.

ttHello?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOkay, listen--

Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDude, are you fucking this up?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWho is that?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThe driver man, I told you--

</b>ttWhat the fuck is going on there?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThey hung up, Walter!  You fucked it

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.

The phone chirps.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYa see?  Nothing is fucked up here,

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttShutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(patronizing)
ttOkay Dude.  Have it your way.

The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttBut they're amateurs.

The Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone:

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttDude here.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOkay, vee proceed.  But only if there 
ttis no funny stuff.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah.

</b>ttSo no funny stuff.  Okay?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHey, just tell me where the fuck you 
ttwant us to go.

<b>A HIGHWAY SIGN:  SIMI VALLEY ROAD
</b>
It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThat was the sign.

Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah.  So as long as we get her back, 
ttnobody's in a position to complain.  
ttAnd we keep the baksheesh.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttTerrific, Walter.  But you haven't 
tttold me how we get her back.  Where 
ttis she?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThat's the simple part, Dude.  When

ttand beat  it out of him.

He looks at the Dude.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt...Huh?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.  
ttThat's fucking ingenious, if I 
ttunderstand it correctly.  That's a

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of 
ttthis is its simplicity. If the plan

</b>ttWhat'd he say?  Where's the hand-

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThere is no fucking hand-off, Walter!   
ttAt a wooden bridge we throw the money

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWe throw the money out of the moving

Walter stares dumbly for a beat.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWe can't do that, Dude.  That fucks

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell call them up and explain it to

ttmoron.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttOkay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's 
ttthe bridge--

There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.  
The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from 
the back seat.  Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to 
grab the laundry.

And there goes the ringer.

He flings it out the window.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYour wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhat the fuck?

Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYou didn't think I was rolling out 
ttof here naked!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, please--

Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out 
over the road.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's 
tttake that hill!

Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he 
hits the pavement.  The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, 
cursing, takes the wheel.

<b>OUTSIDE
</b>
Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle 
flashes tear open the wrapping paper.

<b>INSIDE THE CAR
</b>
The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.

<b>OUTSIDE
</b>
The car clunks and screams around in a skid.

<b>INSIDE
</b>
The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something.

<b>OUTSIDE
</b>
As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The 
front of his car is crumpled into a tree.  The car body saps 
back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out.

WALTER  is  just  rising  from  the  ground  massaging an  
injured knee.

The  Dude  runs  up  the  road  toward  the bridge,  
frantically waving the satchel in the air.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b><b>ttWE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!
</b>
There is a distant engine roar.  A motorcycle bumps up onto 
the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires 
squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite 
direction.  It is closely followed by two more roaring 
motorcycles.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!

The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching 
the three red tail lights fishtail away.

<b>AFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE:
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAhh fuck it, let's go bowling.

<b>BOWLING LANE
</b>
A ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins.

<b>WALTER.
</b>
He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of 
molded plastic chairs.  The Dude listlessly holds the portable 
phone in his lap.  It is ringing.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used 
ttto say.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhat the fuck is that supposed to 
ttmean?  What the fuck're we gonna 
tttell Lebowski?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHuh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't

The portable phone stops ringing.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?  The problem is--what do you 
ttmean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
ttthey're gonna kill that poor woman--

Donny is trotting excitedly up.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttThey posted the next round of the

</b>ttDonny, shut the f--when do we play?

</b>ttSaturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttSheesh.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, how--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShomer shabbas.

The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThat's it.  I'm out of here.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFor Christ's sake, Dude.

Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling 
alley.

Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the 
hand-off, everything went, uh, you know--

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttOh yeah, how'd it go?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWent alright.  Dude's car got a little

ttfucking money and they're gonna--
ttthey're gonna--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttKill that poor woman.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWalter, if you can't ride in a car, 
tthow d'you get around on Shammas--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttReally, Dude, you surprise me.  
ttThey're not gonna kill shit.  They're

ttAm I wrong?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWho's got a fucking million fucking

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt"Our" car, Walter?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAnd what do they got, Dude?  My dirty 
ttundies.  My fucking whites--Say, 
ttwhere is  the car?

The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out 
at an empty parking space.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWho has your undies, Walter?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhere's your car, Dude?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou don't know, Walter?  You seem to 
ttknow the answer to everything else!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped 
ttspot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIt's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking 
ttknow it's been stolen!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWell, certainly that's a possibility, 
ttDude--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAw, fuck it.

The Dude walks away across the lot.  The portable phone starts 
ringing again.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWhere you going, Dude?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI'm going home, Donny.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttYour phone's ringing, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThank you, Donny.

<b>DUDE'S LIVING ROOM
</b>
The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, 
fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.  Facing him 
on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, 
the other a fresh-faced rookie.

At the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping.  
The Dude waits for the rings to end.  When they do:

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt1972 Pontiac LeBaron.

<b>ttttYOUNGER COP
</b>ttColor?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttGreen.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, 
ttcoloration.

<b>ttttYOUNGER COP
</b>ttAnd was there anything of value in  
ttthe car?

<b>DULLY:
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple 
ttof Creedence tapes.  And there was 
tta, uh. . . my briefcase.

<b>ttttYOUNGER COP
</b>ttIn the briefcase?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttPapers.  Just papers.  You know, my 
ttpapers.  Business papers.

<b>ttttYOUNGER COP
</b>ttAnd what do you do, sir?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI'm unemployed.

<b>ttttOLDER COP
</b>tt...Most people, we're working nights, 
ttthey offer us coffee.

There is silence.  Dude continues to stare at a spot on the 
floor.  The older cop stares at him.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But 
ttit's nice when they offer.

<b>AT LENGTH:
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt...Also, my rug was stolen.

<b>ttttYOUNGER COP
</b>ttYour rug was in the car.

The Dude taps the floor with his foot.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNo.  Here.

<b>ttttYOUNGER COP
</b>ttSeparate incidents?

The Dude stares at the floor.

Silence.

<b>ttttOLDER COP
</b>ttSnap out of it, son.

The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct  from the  
chirp of the portable.  The Dude makes no move to answer  
it.   Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks 
on.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou find them much?  Stolen cars?

Dude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in.  Leave a message 
after the beep.  It takes a minute.

<b>ttttYOUNGER COP
</b>ttSometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much 
tthope for the tape deck though.  Or 
ttthe Creedence tapes.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAnd the, uh, the briefcase?

Beep.

<b>ttttFEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE
</b>ttMr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.  
ttCall when you get home and I'll send 
tta car for you.  My name is Maude 
ttLebowski.  I'm the woman who took 
ttthe rug.

Beep.  Dial tone.

<b>ttttOLDER COP
</b>ttWell, I guess we can close the file 
tton that one.

<b>TRACKING FORWARD
</b>
We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown 
L.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing 
industrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are 
spare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude's brilliant 
rug.

We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude, 
standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky 
depths of the cavernous space.

Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head.  
As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.

We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended 
from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the 
floor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush 
in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas.

The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two 
young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers 
reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track 
and haul it back for another push.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI'll be with you in a minute, Mr. 
ttLebowski.

She rumbles by in another pass.

All right, we'll do the blue tomorrow.  Elfranco.  Pedro.  
Help me down.

The  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked  
except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts  
and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix 
look.

Does the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIs that what that's a picture of?

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttIn a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. 
ttMy art has been commended as being 
ttstrongly vaginal.  Which bothers 
ttsome men.  The word itself makes 
ttsome men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOh yeah?

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttYes, they don't like hearing it and 
ttfind it difficult to say.  Whereas 
ttwithout batting an eye a man will 
ttrefer to his "dick" or his "rod" or 
tthis "Johnson".

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt"Johnson"?

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttThank you.

This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe.

All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My father 
told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a 
gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.  
Now.  As for this. . . "kidnapping"--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttYes, I know about it.  And I know 
ttthat you acted as courier.  And let 
ttme tell you something:  the whole 
ttthing stinks to high heaven.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttRight, but let me explain something 
ttabout that rug--

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttDo you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttSex.  The physical act of love.  
ttCoitus.  Do you like it?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI was talking about my rug.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttYou're not interested in sex?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou mean coitus?

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttI like it too.  It's a male myth 
ttabout feminists that we hate sex.  
ttIt can be a natural, zesty enterprise. 
ttBut unfortunately there are some 
ttpeople--it is called satyriasis in 
ttmen, nymphomania in women--who engage 
ttin it compulsively and without joy.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOh, no.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttYes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate 
ttsouls cannot love in the true sense 
ttof the word.  Our mutual acquaintance 
ttBunny is one of these.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttListen, Maude, I'm sorry if your 
ttstepmother is a nympho, but I don't 
ttsee what it has to do with--do you 
tthave any kalhua?

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttTake a look at this, sir.

She is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen 
flickers to life.  A title card:

<b>JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS
</b>
<b>SECOND CARD:
</b>
<b>KARL HUNGUS
</b>
<b>AND
</b>
<b>BUNNY LAJOYA
</b>
<b>IN
</b>
<b>A THIRD CARD:
</b>
<b>LOGJAMMIN'
</b>
The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway  
to his glass.

From the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then  a 
door opening.

On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced  
man in blue coyer-alls.  It is Dieter, the floater in  
Lebowski's pool.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttHello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttShit, I know that guy.  He's a 
ttnihilist.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttAnd you recognize her, of course.

The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.

Bunny The TV is in here.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttZa, okay, I bring mein toolz.

Bunny This is my friend Shari.  She just came over to use 
the shower.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttt(grimly)
ttThe story is ludicrous.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttMein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to 
ttverk in zese clozes--

Maude switches off the set.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttLord.  You can imagine where it goes 
ttfrom here.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHe fixes the cable?

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttDon't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little 
ttmatter to me that this woman chose 
ttto pursue a career

in pornography, nor that she has been "banging" Jackie 
Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I am 
one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other 
being my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts 
and--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttShit yeah, the achievers.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttLittle Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
ttyes, and proud we are of all of them.  
ttI asked my father about his withdrawal 
ttof a million dollars from the 
ttFoundation account and he told me 
ttabout this "abduction", but I tell 
ttyou it is preposterous.  This

</b>ttI'm getting to your rug. My  father 
ttand I don't get along; he doesn't 
ttapprove of my lifestyle and, needless 
ttto say, I don't approve of his.  
ttStill, I hardly wish to make my 
ttfather's embezzlement a police matter, 
ttso I'm proposing that you try to 
ttrecover the money from the people 
ttyou delivered it to.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell--sure, I could do that--

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttIf you successfully do so, I will 
ttcompensate you to the tune of 1% of 
ttthe recovered sum.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttA hundred.

</b>ttThousand, yes, bones or clams or 
ttwhatever you call them.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, but what about--

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>tt--your rug, yes, well with that money 
ttyou can buy any number of rugs that 
ttdon't have sentimental value for me.  
ttAnd I am sorry about that crack on 
ttthe jaw.

The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has 
all but disappeared.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOh that's okay, I hardly even--

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttHere's the name and number of a doctor 
ttwho will look at it for you.  You 
ttwill receive no bill.  He's a good

</b>ttThat's really thoughtful but I--

</b>ttPlease see him, Jeffrey.  He's a

<b>LIMO
</b>
The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian,  listening to 
the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery 
cap a ponytail emerges.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>tt--So he says, "My son can't hold a 
ttjob, my daughter's married to a 
ttfuckin' loser, and I got a rash on 
ttmy ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.  
ttBut you know me.  I can't complain."

<b>THROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER:
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.ttt 
ttFuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya 
ttTony.

He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves 
milk on his mustache.

I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost  a 
little  money, I  was down in the dumps.

<b>ttttTONY
</b>ttAw, forget about it.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be 
ttworrying about that shit.  Life goes 
tton!

The limo has rolled to a stop.  The Dude gets out, still 
holding his drink.

<b>ttttTONY
</b>ttHome sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your 
ttfriend in the Volkswagon?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?

His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his 
shoulder.

He followed us here.

The Dude turns to look.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the 
curb.  In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape.

<b>THE DUDE
</b>
He scowls.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhen did he-

The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-
nelson by another uniformed chauffeur.

<b>ttttSECOND CHAUFFEUR
</b>ttInto the limo, you sonofabitch.  No 
ttarguments.

As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds 
his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFuck, man!  There's a beverage here!

The waiting limo's back door is flung open.

<b>INSIDE
</b>
The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the 
rear. The door is slammed behind him.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttStart talking and talk fast you lousy 
ttbum!

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttWe've been frantically trying to 
ttreach you, Dude.

Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from 
the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttWhere's my goddamn money, you bum?!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell we--I don't--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttThey did not receive the money, you

</b>
<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttThis is our concern, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNo, man, nothing is fucked here--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b><b>ttNOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE 
</b><b>ttHAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!
</b>
The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttC'mon man, who're you gonna believe?  
ttThose guys are--we dropped off the 
ttdamn money--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b><b>ttWHAT?!
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI--the royal we, you know, the 
tteditorial--I dropped off the money, 
ttexactly as per--Look, I've got certain 
ttinformation, certain things have 
ttcome to light, and uh, has it ever 
ttoccurred to you, man, that given the 
ttnature of all this new shit, that, 
ttuh, instead of running around blaming

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttWhat in God's holy name are you

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI'll tell you what I'm blathering

ttShe kidnapped herself!

Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck.  The Dude is encouraged.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell sure, look at it!  Young trophy 
ttwife, I mean, in the parlance of our 
tttimes, owes money all over town, 
ttincluding to known pornographers--
ttand that's cool, that's cool-- but 
ttI'm saying, she needs money, and of 
ttcourse they're gonna say they didn't 
ttget it 'cause she wants more, man, 
ttshe's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
tthasn't that ever occurred to you...?  
ttSir?

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttNo.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not 
ttoccurred to me.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttThat had not occurred to us, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell, okay, you're not privy to all 
ttthe new shit, so uh, you know, but 
ttthat's what you pay me for.  Speaking 
ttof which, would it be possible for 
ttme to get my twenty grand in cash?  
ttI gotta check this with my accountant 
ttof course, but my concern is that, 
ttyou know, it could bump me into a 
tthigher tax--

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttBrandt, give him the envelope.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell, okay, if you've already made 
ttout the check.  Brandt is handing 
tthim a letter-sized envelope which is 
ttdistended by something inside.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttWe received it this morning.

The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton 
wadding and unrolls it.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttSince you have failed to achieve, 
tteven in the modest task that was 
ttyour charge, since you have stolen 
ttmy money, and since you have 
ttunrepentantly betrayed my trust.

The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up 
inside.  The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and 
starts to unroll the inner package.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttI have no choice but to tell these 
ttbums that they should do whatever is 
ttnecessary to recover their money 
ttfrom you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And 
ttwith Brandt as my witness, tell you 
ttthis:  Any further harm visited upon 
ttBunny, shall be visited tenfold upon 
ttyour head.

Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents 
of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>tt...By God sir.  I will not abide 
ttanother toe.

<b>COFFEE SHOP
</b>
The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off 
into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little 
clinking noises.

<b>AFTER A LONG BEAT:
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThat wasn't her toe.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhose toe was it, Walter?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHow the fuck should I know?  I do

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThe nail polish, Walter.

</b>ttWell that's just, that's the stress

ttvictimless crimes--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhat about the toe?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttFORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
</b>
A waitress enters.

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>ttCould you please keep your voices 
ttdown--this is a family restaurant.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttOh, please dear!  I've got news for

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, this isn't a First Amendment

</b>ttLady, I got buddies who died face-

<b>THE DUDE GETS UP:
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAll right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry 
ttma'am.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDon't run away from this, Dude!  
ttGoddamnit, this affects all of us!

The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttOur basic freedoms!

He looks defiantly around.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.

He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak, 
affecting nonchalance.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFinishing my coffee.

<b>DUDE'S BATHROOM
</b>
A dripping noise.

The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint 
pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head.

We hear the phone ringing in the other roam.

The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the 
soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub.

After the Dude's outgoing message we hear:

<b>ttttVOICE THROUGH MACHINE
</b>ttMr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer 
ttRolvaag of the L.A.P.D.

The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying.

<b>ttttVOICE THROUGH MACHINE
</b>ttWe've recovered your vehicle.  It 
ttcan be claimed at the North Hollywood 
ttAuto Circus there on Victory.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFar out.  Far fuckin' out.

<b>ttttMESSAGE
</b>ttYou'll just need to present a--

The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of 
someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHunh?

He looks blearily at the open doorway.

A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is 
striding across the living room towards the bathroom.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHey!  This is a private residence, 
ttman!

The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the 
cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other 
men are entering behind him.

The room is dark now except for spill from the living room; 
the men are backlit shapes.

One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small 
animal skitters excitedly about the floor.

The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNice marmot.

The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, 
screaming, into the bathtub.

The Dude screams.

The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a 
frenzy of fearful aggression.

<b>ttttFIRST MAN
</b>ttVee vant zat money, Lebowski.

The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to 
hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his 
head and squishes him back into the water.

<b>ttttSECOND MAN
</b>ttYou think veer kidding und making 
ttmit de funny stuff?

<b>ttttTHIRD MAN
</b>ttVee could do things you only dreamed 
ttof, Lebowski.

<b>ttttSECOND MAN
</b>ttJa, vee could really do it, Lebowski.  
ttVee belief in nossing.

He scoops the marmot out of the water.  It shakes itself 
off, spraying the Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJesus!

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttVee belief in nossing, Lebowski!  
<b>ttNOSSING!!
</b>
The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking 
itself and convulsing in little sneezes.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJesus Christ!

<b>ttttFIRST MAN
</b>ttTomorrow vee come back und cut off 
ttyour chonson.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttExcuse me?

The three men turn to leave.  Over their retreating backs:

<b>ttttSECOND MAN
</b>ttJust sink about zat, Lebowski.

<b>ttttFIRST MAN
</b>ttJa, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

<b>ttttSECOND MAN
</b>ttJa, und maybe vee stamp on it und

<b>NORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS
</b>
A policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a 
large parking lot.

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttYou're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.  
ttLebowski. Must've been a joyride 
ttsituation; they abandoned the car 
ttonce they hit the retaining wall.

They have reached the Dude's car.  The  driver's side  
exterior has been scraped raw.  The policeman hands the Dude  
a door  handle and an exterior rear-view mirror.

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttThese were on the road next to the 
ttcar.  You'll have to get in on the 
ttother side.

The Dude climbs in the passenger side.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttMy fucking briefcase!  It's not here!

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttYeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.  
ttYou're lucky they left the tape deck 
ttthough.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttMy fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's 
ttthat smell?

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttUh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept 
ttin the car.  Or perhaps just used it 
ttas a toilet, and moved on.

The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will 
not go; he bellows through the glass:

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhen will you find these guys?  I 
ttmean, do you have any promising leads?

The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttLeads, yeah.  I'll just check with 
ttthe boys down at the Crime Lab.  
ttThey've assigned four more detectives 
ttto the case, got us working in shifts.

The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman 
rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by 
the glass.

<b>BOWLING ALLEY BAR

The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a 
White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer 
nuts.

</b>ttOh for Christ--will you shut the

ttYeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttNow Dude--

Walter sadly shakes his head.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFucking Germans.  Nothing changes.  
ttFucking Nazis.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttThey were Nazis, Dude?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttCome on, Donny, they were threatening

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttUh-huh.

</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThey kept saying they believe in

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttNihilists!  Jesus.

Walter looks haunted.

Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, 
Dude, at least it's an ethos.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAnd let's also not forget--let's not

</b>ttFuck the tournament?!

<b>SAD; QUIET:
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttOkay Dude.  I can see you don't want

They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar.  As he stares

<b>DOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS:

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAnother Caucasian, Gary.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttRight, Dude.

<b>STILL STARING DOWN AT THE BAR:

</b>ttFriends like these, huh Gary.

<b>ttttGARY
</b>ttThat's right, Dude.

The pop song on the jukebox has ended; someone puts on 
"Tumbling Tumbleweeds."

A man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter 
vacated.  He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam 
Elliot, perhaps.  He has a large Western-style mustache and 
wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat.

<b>TO THE BARTENDER:

the movie.

<b>ttttBARTENDER
</b>ttSioux City Sarsaparilla.

The Stranger nods.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttThat's a good one.

Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar.  His 
crinkled eyes settle on the Dude.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttHow ya doin' there, Dude?

The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAhh, not so good, man.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttFar from it.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttMm.

The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the 
bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttMuch obliged.

He looks back at the Dude.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttI like your style, Dude.

<b>THE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY:

ttGot a whole cowboy thing goin'.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttThankie. . . Just one thing, Dude.

The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how 
out of place the cowpoke is.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThe fuck are you talking about?

The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the 
bar.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttOkay, have it your way.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttTake it easy, Dude.

</b>ttDieter has been on the fringes of--

The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf.

<b>ttttMAUDE

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttHuh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their

the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a 
picture

<b>OF THREE YOUNG GERMANS, THEIR FOREHEADS LOOMING BELOW

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell yeah...I know that.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttSo Dieter has the money?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell, no, not exactly.  It's a 
ttcomplicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.  
ttLotta outs.  And a lotta strands to

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttDo you still have that doctor's

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?  No, really, I don't even have 
ttthe bruise any more, I--

She is scribbling.

</b>ttPlease Jeffrey.  I don't want to be 
ttresponsible for any delayed after-
tteffects.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttDelayed after-eff--

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttI want you to see him immediately.

She is picking up a telephone.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttI'll see if he's available.  He's a 
ttgood man, and thorough.

<b>CLOSE SHOT   THE DUDE
</b>
His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of 
"Comin' Up Around the Bend."

Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, 
a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back.  After a 
moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His 
hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the 
Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttCould you slide your shorts down 
ttplease, Mr.  Lebowski?

The Dude's eyes open.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?  No, she, she hit me right here.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttI understand sir.  Could you slide 
ttyour shorts down please?

<b>DUDE'S CAR
</b>
The Dude is driving home.  A Creedence tape plays.  The Dude 
is sucking down a joint.  He glances at the rear-view mirror--
and, noticing something, looks again.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
A Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving.

<b>THE DUDE
</b>
His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint 
between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it 
out the driver's window--except that the window is not open.  
The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering 
sparks.

<b>DUDE'S CROTCH
</b>
The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs. 
The Dude screams.

<b>THE STREET
</b>
The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off 
to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes 
to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone 
poll.

<b>INSIDE THE CAR
</b>
The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, 
and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which 
also won't open.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFuck Me.

But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from  
the lit butt.  He looks around for it.

Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion 
and back cushion.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFuckola, man.

He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions.   
There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper 
sticking out from between the cushions.

The Dude pulls it out.

It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and 
dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right-
hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, 
Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled "The Louisiana 
Purchase."  In red ink is a large circled D and some 
handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled 
in red throughout.

<b>CRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER
</b>
We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage 
in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, 
is performing a dance moderne.

As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice 
hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse 
audience.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHe lives in North Hollywood on 
ttRadford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThe In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttNear the In-and-Out Burger--

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttThose are good burgers, Walter.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid 
ttis in the ninth grade, Dude, and his 
ttfather is--are you ready for this?--
ttArthur Digby Sellers.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWho the fuck is that?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWho the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWho the f--have you ever heard of a 
ttlittle show called Branded, Dude?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAll but one man died?  There at Bitter 
ttCreek?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah yeah, I know the fucking show 
ttWalter, so what?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 
tt156 episodes, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThe bulk of the series.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttNot exactly a lightweight.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAnd yet his son is a fucking dunce.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttUh.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out 
ttthere after the, uh, the.

He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat have you.  We'll, uh--

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWe'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, 
ttbrace the kid--he'll be a pushover.  
ttWe'll get that fucking money, if he 
tthasn't spent it already.  Million 
ttfucking clams. And yes, we'll be 
ttnear the, uh--some burgers, some 
ttbeers, a few laughs.  Our fucking 
tttroubles are over, Dude.

<b>RESIDENTIAL AREA
</b>
The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated 
house sitting on a scrubby lot.  Parked incongruously in 
front of the house is a brand new red Corvette.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFuck me, man!  That kid's already 
ttspent all the money!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's 
ttstill got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, 
ttdepending on the options.  Wait in 
ttthe car, Donny.

<b>THE FRONT DOOR
</b>
Walter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish 
woman.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttJace?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHello, Pilar?  My name is Walter 
ttSobchak, we spoke on the phone, this 
ttis my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttJace.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttMay we uh, we wanted to talk about 
ttlittle Larry.  May we come in?

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttJace.

They enter a dim living room and stand, looking about, as 
Pilar

<b>CALLS UP THE STAIRS:
</b>
<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttLarry!  Sweetie!  Dat mang is here!

There is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and 
nudges the Dude.  At the other end of the living room a man 
lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its 
midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.  
It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct 
hisses in and out.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThat's him, Dude.

<b>ttttVIVA VOCE
</b>ttAnd a good day to you, sir.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttSee down, please.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThank you, ma'am.

He and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa.  In a lowered 
voice, to Pilar:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDoes he, uh. . . Is he still writing?

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttNo, no.  He has healt' problems.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>HE BELLOWS ACROSS THE ROOM:
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI just want to say, sir, that we're 
ttboth enormous--on a personal level, 
ttBranded, especially the early 
ttepisodes, has been a source of, uh, 
ttinspir---

There are footsteps on the stairs.  Larry, a fifteen-year-
old, looks at the two men.

<b>ttttPILAR
</b>ttSee down, Sweetie.  These are the 
ttpoliceman--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttNo ma'am, I didn't mean to give the 
ttimpression that we're police exactly.  
ttWe're hoping that it will not be 
ttnecessary to call the police.

He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttBut that is up to little Larry here.  
ttIsn't it, Larry?

Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out 
the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag.  He holds it out 
at arm's length, displaying it to Larry.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttIs this your homework, Larry?

Larry does not respond.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttIs this your homework, Larry?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttLook, man, did you--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDude, please!. . .  Is this your 
tthomework, Larry?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJust ask him if he--ask him about 
ttthe car, man!

Walter is still holding out the homework.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttIs this yours, Larry?  Is this your 
tthomework, Larry?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIs the car out front yours?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttIs this your homework, Larry?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWe know it's his fucking homework, 
ttWalter!  Where's the fucking money, 
ttyou little brat?

Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework 
extended towards him.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttLook, Larry. . . Have you ever heard 
ttof Vietnam?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYou're going to enter a world of 
ttpain, son.  We know that this is 
ttyour homework.  We know you stole a 
ttcar--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAnd the fucking money!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAnd the fucking money.  And we know 
ttthat this is your homework, Larry.

No answer.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYou're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.

<b>FINALLY, IN DISGUST:
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAh, this is pointless.

As he shoves the homework back in the attache case:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAll right, Plan B.  You might want 
ttto watch out the front window there, 
ttLarry.

He is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to 
follow him.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThis is what happens when you FUCK a 
ttSTRANGER in the ASS, Larry.

<b>OUTSIDE
</b>
Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like 
an enraged encyclopedia salesman.  Without looking back at, 
the Dude, who follows:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFucking language problem, Dude.

He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes 
out a tire iron.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttMaybe he'll understand this.

He is walking over to the Corvette.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttYOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!
</b>
CRASH!  He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which 
shatters.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttYOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!
</b>
CRASH!  He takes out the driver's window.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttTHIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A 
</b><b>ttSTRANGER IN THE ASS!
</b>
Lights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs 
bark.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttHERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!
</b>
<b>CRASH!
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttHERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER 
</b><b>ttIN THE ASS!
</b>
<b>CRASH!
</b>
A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over 
behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of 
the crowbar.

<b>ttttMAN
</b><b>ttWHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!
</b>
He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.

<b>ttttMAN
</b><b>ttI JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!
</b>
Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHunh?

The man looks about, wildly.

<b>ttttMAN
</b><b>ttI KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR

He runs over to the Dude's car.

<b>INSIDE THE CAR
</b>
Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny.

<b>ttttMAN
</b><b>ttI KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
</b>
<b>ttttt  ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE DUDE'S CAR
</b>
We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as 
it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved-
in windows.

The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the

road.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 
'on In-and-Out Burgers.

Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.

<b>DUDE'S BUNGALOW
</b>
As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four 
into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI accept your apology. . . No I, I 
ttjust want to handle it myself from 
ttnow on. . . No.  That has nothing to 
ttdo with it. . . .Yes, it made it 
tthome, I'm calling from home.  No, 
ttWalter, it didn't look like Larry 
ttwas about to crack.

He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair 
that stands nearby.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell that's your perception. . . 
ttWell you're right, Walter, and the 
ttunspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND 
ttLEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah, 
ttI'll be at practice.

He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into 
place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced 
against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when 
the door is opened--outwards.  The chair clatters to the 
floor.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?

Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in, 
kicking the chair away.

<b>ttttWOO
</b>ttPin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie
ttTreehorn wants to see you.

<b>ttttBLOND MAN
</b>ttAnd we know which Lebowski you are, 
ttLebowski.

<b>ttttWOO
</b>ttYeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk 
ttto the deadbeat Lebowski.

<b>ttttBLOND MAN
</b>ttYou're not dealing with morons here.

<b>BLACKNESS
</b>
Out of the blackness something is falling toward us.  It is 
a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her 
mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy.  She is topless.  
She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a 
beat reappears, rising into the night sky.

<b>MALIBU BEACH
</b>
A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried 
hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual 
attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in 
nightmarish slow motion.

<b>WIDER
</b>
It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing 
kerosene heaters.  1960's mainstream jazz, of the Mancini-
Brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'.

In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears  
into darkness, descends into light, rises again.

A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach 
light.  He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants 
and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the 
neck.  Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and 
disappears.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttHello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm 
ttJackie Treehorn.

<b>INSIDE THE BEACH HOUSE
</b>
The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThis is quite a pad you got here, 
ttman.  Completely unspoiled.

<b>ttttTREEHORN
</b>ttWhat's your drink, Dude?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhite Russian, thanks.  How's the 
ttsmut business, Jackie?

<b>ttttTREEHORN
</b>ttI wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in

ttadvocacy, and--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhich one was Logjammin'?

<b>ttttTREEHORN
</b>ttRegrettably, it's true, standards 
tthave fallen in adult entertainment.  
ttIt's video, Dude.  Now that we're 
ttcompeting with the amateurs, we can't 
ttafford to invest that little extra 
ttin story, production value, feeling.

He taps his forehead with one finger.

<b>ttttTREEHORN
</b>ttPeople forget that the brain is the 
ttbiggest erogenous zone--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOn you, maybe.

He hands him the drink.

<b>ttttTREEHORN
</b>ttOf course, you do get the good with 
ttthe bad.  The new technology permits 
ttus to do exciting things with

ttWell Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI thought you might know, man.

<b>ttttTREEHORN
</b>ttMe?  How would I know?  The only

Treehorn waves this off.

<b>ttttTREEHORN
</b>ttI've heard the kidnapping story, so

ttall this, Dude, and I don't care 
ttwhat you're trying to take off her

ttI'm saying is, I want mine.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, well, right man, there are 
ttmany facets to this, uh, you know, 
ttmany interested parties.  If I can 
ttfind your money, man-- what's in it 
ttfor the Dude?

<b>ttttTREEHORN
</b>ttOf course, there's that to discuss.  
ttRefill?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttDoes the Pope shit in the woods?

<b>ttttTREEHORN
</b>ttLet's say a 10% finder's fee?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOkay, Jackie, done.  I like the way

He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you 
ttmix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.

The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.

<b>ttttTREEHORN
</b>ttA fifteen-year-old?  Is this your 
ttidea of a joke?

Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.  He is joined on 
either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking 
grimly down at the Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNo funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's 
ttgot it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just 
ttwanted a car.  All the Dude ever 
ttwanted. . . was his rug back. . . 
ttnot greedy. . . it really.

He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.  
Tied the room together.

He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.

<b>SCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD:
</b>
<b>JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS
</b>
<b>ANOTHER TITLE CARD:
</b>
<b>THE DUDE
</b>
<b>AND
</b>
<b>MAUDE LEBOWSKI
</b>
<b>IN
</b>
<b>THIRD TITLE CARD:
</b>
<b>GUTTERBALLS
</b>
The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked 
by a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns  
into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's  
"Just Dropped In."

The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable 
repairman.  The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light 
as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.

In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing 
operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an 
armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, 
and holds a trident.

The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps 
her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball.

The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini- 
skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs 
turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the 
end.

But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their 
legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, 
the tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face 
down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides.

His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little 
ball-guide arrows zipping by.

The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so 
that he is now gliding along the lane face-up.

Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing 
chorines.

The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so 
that he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward 
and his forward momentum blows back his hair.

Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, 
are the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them,  
and rush on into black.

A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless 
woman, squealing, her legs kicking.

As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three 
men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool 
of light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding 
oversized shears which they menacingly scissor.

The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the 
advancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping.

The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of 
car-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights.  
The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific 
Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.

With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with 
flashing gumballs pulls up.

<b>SQUAD CAR
</b>
The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the 
motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHe was innocent.  Not a charge was 
tttrue.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.

<b>CHIEF'S OFFICE
</b>
The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces 
off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.

His wallet is tossed onto the desk.

The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through 
it with disgusted incredulity.

<b>ttttCHIEF
</b>ttThis is your only I.D.?

He is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card.
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI know my rights.

<b>ttttCHIEF
</b>ttYou don't know shit, Lebowski.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI want a fucking lawyer, man.  I 
ttwant Bill Kunstler.

<b>ttttCHIEF
</b>ttWhat are you, some kind of sad-assed 
ttrefugee from the fucking sixties?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttCHIEF
</b>ttMr. Treehorn tells us that he had to 
tteject you from his garden party, 
ttthat you were drunk and abusive.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThat guy treats women like objects, 
ttman.

<b>ttttCHIEF
</b>ttMr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in 
ttthis town, Lebowski.  You don't draw 
ttshit.  We got a nice quiet beach 
ttcommunity here, and I aim to keep it 
ttnice and quiet.  So let me make 
ttsomething plain.  I don't like you 
ttsucking around bothering our citizens, 
ttLebowski.  I don't like your jerk-
ttoff name, I don't like your jerk-off 
ttface, I don't like your jerk- off 
ttbehavior, and I don't like you, jerk-
ttoff --do I make myself clear?

The Dude stares.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.  It 
hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee 
splashing everywhere.

The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt--Ow!  Fucking fascist!

The Chief slaps him twice.

<b>ttttCHIEF
</b>ttStay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts 
kicking at him.

<b>ttttCHIEF
</b>ttStay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep 
ttyour ugly fucking goldbricking ass 
ttout of my beach community!

<b>CAB
</b>
The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks 
with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his 
face and scalp.

"Peaceful Easy Feeling" is on the radio.

<b>DUDE'S POV
</b>
The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds 
under a knit cap.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJesus, man, can you change the 
ttstation?

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttFuck you man!  You don't like my 
ttfucking music, get your own fucking 
ttcab!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI've had a--

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttI pull over and kick your ass out, 
ttman!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>tt--had a rough night, and I hate the 
ttfucking Eagles, man--

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttThat's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

<b>THE STREET
</b>
The cab screeches over towards the curb.  Another car, 
oncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by.

<b>INSIDE THE OTHER CAR
</b>
It is a red convertible.  The driver, singing loudly and 
badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a 
dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a 
kite, is Bunny Lebowski.

<b>THE FOOTWELL
</b>
On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright 
red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.

When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch.

Five more toes.

<b>DUDE'S BUNGALOW
</b>
The Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed 
to a lump on his forehead, and looks around.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJesus.

The place is a wreck.  Furniture has been overturned, 
upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.

Quiet.

The door to the bedroom starts to creak open.

The Dude cringes.

Maude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttJeffrey.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttMaude?

She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttLove me.

The Dude is stupefied.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThat's my robe.

<b>ttttt THOOMP!  ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO:
</b>
<b>BLACK
</b>
After a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the 
blackness:

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttTell me a little about yourself, 
ttJeffrey.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell, uh. . . Not much to tell.

A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting 
himself a joint.  He shakes the match out to restore blackness 
except for the glowing tip of the joint.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI was, uh, one of the authors of the 
ttPort Huron Statement.--The original 
ttPort Huron Statement.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNot the compromised second draft.  
ttAnd then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the 
ttSeattle Seven?

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttMmnun.

Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude lie 
next to each other in bed.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAnd then. . . let's see, I uh--music 
ttbusiness briefly.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttOh?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed 
ttof Sound Tour.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttBunch of assholes.  And then, you 
ttknow, little of this, little of that. 
ttMy career's, uh, slowed down a bit 
ttlately.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttWhat do you do for fun?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.  
ttDrive around.  The occasional acid 
ttflashback.

He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.  She wedges a 
pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each 
kneecap.  She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep 
her pelvis raised.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttWhat happened to your house?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJackie Treehorn trashed the place.  
ttWanted to save the finder's fee.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttFinder's fee?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHe thought I had your father's money, 
ttso he got me out of the way while he 
ttlooked for it.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttIt's not my father's money, it's the 
ttFoundation's.  Why did he think you 
tthad it?  And who does?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttLarry Sellers, a high-school kid.  
ttReal fucking brat.

He picks a White Russian off the bedside table.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttJeffrey--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIt's a complicated case, Maude.  
ttLotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately 
ttI've been adhering to a pretty strict, 
ttuh, drug regimen to keep my mind, 
ttyou know, limber.  I'm real fucking 
ttclose to your father's money, real 
ttfucking close.  It's just--

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttI keep telling you, it's the 
ttFoundation's money.  Father doesn't 
tthave any.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?  He's fucking loaded.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttNo no, the wealth was all Mother's.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttBut your father--he runs stuff, he--

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttWe did let Father run one of the 
ttcompanies, briefly, but he didn't do 
ttvery well at it.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttBut he's--

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttHe helps administer the charities 
ttnow, and I give him a reasonable 
ttallowance.  He has no money of his 
ttown.  I know how he likes to present 
tthimself; Father's weakness is vanity.  
ttHence the slut.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is 
ttthat yoga?

Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees 
pulled in.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttIt increases the chances of 
ttconception.

The Dude spits some White Russian.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIncreases?

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttWell yes, what did you think this 
ttwas all about?  Fun and games?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell...no, of course not--

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttI want a child.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttLook, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.  
ttIn fact I don't want the father to 
ttbe someone I have to see socially, 
ttor who'll have any interest in rearing 
ttthe child himself.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh...

Something occurs to him.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttSo...that doctor.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttExactly.  What happened to your face?  
ttDid Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

The Dude is staring off into space, thinking.  His answer is 
absent.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNo, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.  
ttA real reactionary. . . So your 
ttfather. . . Oh man, I get it!

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttWhat?

The Dude is leaving the bedroom.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, my thinking about the case, 
ttman, it had become uptight.  Yeah.  
ttYour father--

<b>LIVING ROOM
</b>
The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone.

<b>ttttPHONE VOICE
</b>ttThis is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in; 
ttleave a message after the beep.

<b>FROM THE BEDROOM:
</b>
<b>ttttMAUDE'S VOICE
</b>ttWhat're you talking about?

Beep.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, if you're there, pick up the 
ttfucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, 
ttthis is an emergency.  I'm not--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDude?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, listen, I'm at my place, I 
ttneed you to come pick me up--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI can't drive, Dude, it's erev

</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttErev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm 
ttnot even supposed to pick up the

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIt is a fucking emergency.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI understand.  That's why I picked 
ttup the phone.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttTHEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind,

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDude, I'm not supposed to make calls--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b><b>ttWALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA

</b><b>ttI'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
</b>
<b>ttttMAUDE'S VOICE
</b>ttJeffrey?

<b>THE DUDE
</b>
He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His 
attention is caught by something down the street.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
A car is  parked halfway down the block.  We can see the 
shape of a fat man in the driver's seat.

<b>THE DUDE
</b>
Striding purposefully down the street.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car's 
ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over.  More 
whines and coughs; no start.

The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him.  He brings up a 
newspaper, which he holds before his face.

<b>THE DUDE
</b>
As he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver's 
window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground.  
He is revved with nervous energy.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttGet out of that fucking car, man!

The man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's 
movement as he gets out.

The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch.

He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a 
short fringe and a mustache.

The Dude shouts to cover his fear:

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWho the fuck are you, man!  Come on, 
ttman!

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttRelax, man!  No physical harm 
ttintended!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWho the fuck are you?  Why've you 
ttbeen following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttHey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

The Dude is stunned.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttBrother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttIrish m--What the fuck are you talking 
ttabout?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a 
ttprivate snoop!  Like you, man!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttDA FINO
</b>ttA dick, man!  And let me tell you 
ttsomething: I dig your work. Playing 
ttone side against the other--in bed 
ttwith everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay 
ttaway from my fucking lady friend, 
ttman.

<b>ttttDA FINO
</b>ttHey hey, I'm not messing with your 
ttspecial lady--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttShe's not my special lady, she's my 
ttfucking lady friend.  I'm just helping 
tther conceive, man!

<b>ttttDA FINO
</b>ttHey, man, I'm not--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWho're you working for?  Lebowski?  
ttJackie Treehorn?

<b>ttttDA FINO
</b>ttThe Gundersons.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThe?  Who the fff--

<b>ttttDA FINO
</b>ttThe Gundersons.  It's a wandering 
ttdaughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.  
ttHer real name is Fawn Gunderson.  
ttHer parents want her back.

He is fumbling in his wallet.

<b>ttttDA FINO
</b>ttSee?

The Dude looks at the picture.

It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but 
fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and 
straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJesus fucking Christ.

<b>ttttDA FINO
</b>ttCrazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

He is holding out another picture.

The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her.  
The family farm.

A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat 
snow-swept landscape.

Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.  They think it'll make her 
homesick.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttBoy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on 
ttthe farm once they seen Karl Hungus.

He hands back the picture.

She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she's 
definitely not around.

<b>ttttDA FINO
</b>ttFuck, man!  That's terrible!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, it sucks.

<b>ttttDA FINO
</b>ttWell maybe you and me could pool our 
ttresources--trade information--
ttprofessional courtesy--compeers, you 
ttknow--

We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an 
approaching car.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.  
ttAnd stay away from my special la--
ttfrom my fucking lady friend.

The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its 
passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and 
yapping.

<b>DENNY'S
</b>
Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in 
black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde 
hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless 
tee-shirt, worn thin with age.  She is apparently braless, 
and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and 
arms.

Notable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage-
swaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of 
the bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German.   
They seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad 
and pen.

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>ttYou folks ready?

The German shouting stops.  Dieter looks sourly up.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttI haff lingenberry pancakes.

<b>ttttKIEFFER
</b>ttLingenberry pancakes.

<b>ttttFRANZ
</b>ttSree picks in blanket.

The woman speaks to Dieter in German.  He nods.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttLingenberry pancakes.

<b>WALTER'S CAR
</b>
Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the 
Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from 
the back seat.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI mean we totally fucked it up, man.  
ttWe fucked up his pay-off.  And got 
ttthe kidnappers all pissed off, and 
ttthe big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, 
ttbut he didn't do anything.  Huh?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWell it's, sometimes the cathartic, 
ttuh.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttI'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
ttup, then why does he still leave me 
ttin charge of getting back his wife?  
ttBecause he fucking doesn't want her 
ttback, man!  He's had enough!  He no 
ttlonger digs her!  It's all a show!  
ttBut then, why didn't he give a shit 
ttabout his million bucks?  I mean, he 
ttknew we didn't hand off his briefcase, 
ttbut he never asked for it back.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat's your point, Dude?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHis million bucks was never in it, 
ttman!  There was no money in that 
ttbriefcase!  He was hoping they'd 
ttkill her!  You throw out a ringer 
ttfor a ringer!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttShit yeah!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttOkay, but how does all this add up 
ttto an emergency?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI'm saying, I see what you're getting 
ttat, Dude, he kept the money, but my 
ttpoint is, here we are, it's shabbas, 
ttthe sabbath, which I'm allowed to 
ttbreak only if it's a matter of life 
ttand death--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter, come off it.  You're not 
tteven fucking Jewish, you're--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat the fuck are you talking about?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou're fucking Polish Catholic--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat the fuck are you talking about?  
ttI converted when I married Cynthia!  
ttCome on, Dude!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah, and you were--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYou know this!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAnd you were divorced five fucking 
ttyears ago.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah?  What do you think happens 
ttwhen you get divorced?  You turn in 
ttyour library card?  Get a new driver's 
ttlicense?  Stop being Jewish?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThis driveway.

<b>AS HE TURNS:
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttIt's just part of your whole sick 
ttCynthia thing.  Taking care of her 
ttfucking dog.  Going to her fucking 
ttsynagogue.  You're living in the 
ttfucking past.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThree thousand years of beautiful 
tttradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--
<b>ttYOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE 
</b>ttPAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell 
tthappened?

He is looking off as the car slows.  The Dude looks where 
Walter is looking.

<b>THE LEBOWSKI MANSION
</b>
Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he 
and the Dude get out.

Both are gaping off at the front lawn.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttJesus Christ.

<b>THEIR POV
</b>
Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a 
little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a 
palm trunk.

<b>TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY
</b>
Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny, 
naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing 
into the illuminated pool outside.  Heavy metal music filters 
in from a boom box by the pool.

Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and 
straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the 
length of the hall.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttHe can't see you, Dude.

We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to 
the great study.  Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its 
tail.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhere'd she been?

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttVisiting friends of hers in Palm 
ttSprings.  Just picked up and left, 
ttnever bothered to tell us.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttBut I guess she told Dieter.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttJesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped 
tther.

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttWho's this gentleman, Dude?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWho'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!

<b>ttttBRANDT
</b>ttYou shouldn't go in there, Dude!  
ttHe's very angry!

BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into--

<b>THE GREAT ROOM
</b>
The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door.  His 
wheelchair hums as he spins it around.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttt(bitterly)
ttWell, she's back.  No thanks to you.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhere's the money, Lebowski?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttA MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy 
ttwho's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY 
<b>ttGOLDBRICKING ASS!
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWe know the briefcase was empty,

ttbucks yourself.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttWell, you have your story, I have 
ttmine.  I say I entrusted the money 
ttto you, and you stole it.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttAS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING 
</b><b>ttYOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou thought Bunny'd been kidnapped 
ttand you could use it as a pretext to

ttneeded was a sap to pin it on, and 
ttyou'd just met me.  You thought,

ttthe square community won't give a

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttWell?  Aren't you?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell. . . yeah.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttAll right, get out.  Both of you.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttLook at that fucking phony, Dude!  
ttPretending to be a fucking 
ttmillionaire!

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttI said out.  Now.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttLet me tell you something else.  
ttI've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, 
ttand this guy is a fake.  A fucking 
ttgoldbricker.

He is crossing to Lebowski.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThis guy fucking walks.  I've never 
ttbeen more certain of anything in my 
ttlife!

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttStay away from me, mister!

Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski 
out of the wheelchair by his armpits.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWalk, you fucking phony!

The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing 
the floor like a Raggedy Ann's.  The pomeranian gaily leaps 
and yaps.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttPut me down, you son of a bitch!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttIt's all over, man!  We call your

</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttSure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS!
<b>ttACHTUNG, BABY!!
</b>
He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the 
floor, weeping.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttOh, shit.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttt(sobbing)
ttYou're bullies!  Cowards, both of

Walter is abashed.  The Big Lebowski flails about on the 
floor.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttOh, shit.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHe can't walk, Walter!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah, I can see that, Dude.

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttYou monsters!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHelp me put him back in his chair.

Walter moves to comply.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShit, sorry man.

<b>THROUGH HIS TEARS:

<b>ttttLEBOWSKI
</b>ttStay away from me!  You bullies!

tta fucking crybaby.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWe're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.

The Dude has picked up the Big Lebowski's plaid lap warmer 
and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and 
batting the dog away.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThere ya go.  Sorry man.

Walter, puzzled, hands on hips, stands over the big Lebowski.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShit.  He didn't look like a spinal.

<b>TEN PINS
</b>
Scattered at the cut.

<b>DUDE AND WALTER
</b>
Each with a beer at the scoring table.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttSure you'll see some tank battles.  
ttBut fighting in desert is very

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war 
ttwhereas, uh, this thing should be a 
ttfucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an 
ttM16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking 
tttank.  Just me and Charlie, man, 
tteyeball to eyeball.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThat's fuckin' combat.  The man in 
ttthe black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy 
ttfuckin' adversary.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttWho's in pyjamas, Walter?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch 
ttof fig-eaters with towels on their 
ttheads tryin' to find reverse on a 
ttSoviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

<b>ttttVOICE
</b><b>ttHEY!
</b>
The Dude and Walter look.

Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is 
restrained by O'Brien.

<b>ttttQUINTANA
</b>ttWhat's this "day of rest" shit, man?!

Walter looks at him innocently.

<b>ttttQUINTANA
</b>ttWhat is this bullshit, man?  I don't 
ttfucking care!  It don't matter to 
ttJesus!  But you're not fooling me!  
ttYou might fool the fucks in the league 
ttoffice, but you don't fool Jesus!  
ttIt's bush league psych-out stuff!  
ttLaughable, man!  I would've fucked 
ttyou in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck 
ttyou in the ass next Wednesday instead!

<b>ttttQUINTANA
</b>
He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him 
away.

<b>ttttQUINTANA
</b>ttYou got a date Wednesday, man!

Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his 
shades, watch him go.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHe's cracking.

<b>BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT
</b>
Donny, Walter and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding 
his leatherette ball satchel.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttA tree of life, Dude.  To all who 
ttcling to it.

They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming 
from a boom box.

<b>REVERSE
</b>
Dieter, Kieffer and Franz, in shiny black leather, stand in 
a line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot.  Behind them 
orange flames lick gently at the Dude's car, which has been 
put to the torch.  The orange flames glow on the men's 
creaking leather.  Next to the car are three motorcycles, 
parked in a neat row.  The Dude looks sadly at the burning 
car.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThey finally did it.  They killed my 
ttfucking car.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttVee vant zat money, Lebowski.

<b>ttttKIEFFER
</b>ttJa, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.

<b>ttttFRANZ
</b>ttJa, it seems you forgot our little 
ttdeal, Lebowski.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou don't have the fucking girl, 
ttdipshits.  We know you never did.  
ttSo you've got nothin' on my Johnson.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>
The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in 
German.  Under his breath:

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttAre these the Nazis, Walter?

Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three 
men:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThey're nihilists, Donny, nothing to 
ttbe afraid of.

The Germans stop conferring.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttVee don't care.  Vee still vant zat 
ttmoney or vee fuck you up.

<b>ttttKIEFFER
</b>ttJa, vee still vant ze money.  Vee 
ttsreaten you.

He pulls an uzi from under his coat.  It glints in the 
firelight.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFuck you.  Fuck the three of you.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHey, cool it Walter.

Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThere's no ransom if you don't have 
tta fucking hostage.  That's what ransom 
ttis.  Those are the fucking rules.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttZere ARE no ROOLZ!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttNO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS-
</b><b>ttOF- BITCHES--
</b>
<b>ttttKIEFFER
</b>ttHis girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She 
ttsought we'd be getting million 
ttdollars!  Iss not fair!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFair!  WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST 
<b>ttHERE!  WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF 
</b><b>ttFUCKING CRYBABIES?!
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, 
ttthere never was any money.  The big 
ttLebowski gave me an empty briefcase, 
ttman, so take it up with him.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttAND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
</b>
The Germans confer again, in German.

Donny is visibly frightened.

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttAre they gonna hurt us, Walter?

<b>WALTER 'S TONE IS GENTLE:
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThey won't hurt us, Donny.  These 
ttmen are cowards.

<b>THE CONFERENCE ENDS:
</b>
<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttOkay.  Vee take ze money you haf on 
ttyou und vee call it eefen.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttFuck you.

The Dude is digging into his pocket.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttCome on, Walter, we're ending this 
ttthing cheap.

Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat's mine is mine.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttCome on, Walter!.

Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet:

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttFour dollars here!

He inspects the change in his palm.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAlmost five!

<b>ttttDONNY
</b>ttt(tremulously)
ttI got eighteen dollars, Dude.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(grimly)
ttWhat's mine is mine.

With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b><b>ttVEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR 
</b><b>ttMONEY!
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt(coolly)
ttCome and get it.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b><b>ttVEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttCome and get it.  Fucking nihilist.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b><b>ttI FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShow me what you got.  Nihilist.  
ttDipshit with a nine-toed woman.

In a rage, Dieter charges.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b><b>ttI FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
</b>
<b>WALTER
</b>
hurls his leather satchel.

<b>KIEFFER
</b>
Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard.  The bowling 
ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet.

He falls back, his uzi clattering away.

<b>WALTER
</b>
twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in 
both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes 
on Dieter's ear.

<b>DUDE
</b>
He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate 
kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping.  Franz gives 
a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his 
arms up, evading the kicks.

<b>WALTER
</b>
His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear.  Dieter draws his 
saber against Walter's side, drawing blood.

Walter doesn't react to the wound.  Growling as Dieter 
screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws 
clamped.

<b>THE SABER
</b>
Dieter drops it.

<b>DUDE
</b>
Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks.

<b>WALTER
</b>
still worrying the ear.  With a tearing sound his head and 
Dieter's separate.

<b>DIETER, EARLESS, SCREAMS:
</b>
<b>ttttDIETER
</b><b>ttI FUCK YOU!  YOU CANNOT HURT ME!  I 
</b><b>ttBELIEF IN NUSSING!
</b>
Walter spits his ear into his face.

<b>DUDE
</b>
The Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to 
establish body contact.  Franz continues to kick.

<b>ttttFRANZ
</b><b>ttVEAKLING!
</b>
<b>WALTER
</b>
draws back his fist.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b><b>ttNUSSING!
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttANTI-SEMITE!
</b>
Bam!--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter 
for the count.

<b>DUDE AND FRANZ
</b>
With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to 
charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.

As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the  boom box swings into  
frame to smash him in the face.  Its volume shoots up.

Walter bashes him a few more times over the head.  The music 
screeches to static, then quiet.  Laid out now, Franz too is 
quiet.

All quiet.

Walter, panting, looks around.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWe've got a man down, Dude.

With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to 
Donny, who lies gasping on the ground.

The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHy God!  They shot him, Walter!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttNo Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThey shot Donny!

Donny gasps for air.  His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to 
Walter.  One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThere weren't any shots.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThen what's...

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttIt's a heart attack.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWha.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttCall the medics, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWha. . . Donny--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttHurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping 
ttblood.  Might pass out.

The Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand 
on Donny's shoulder.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttRest easy, good buddy, you're doing 
ttfine.  We got help choppering in.

<b>FADE OUT
</b>
<b>HOLD IN BLACK
</b>
<b>THE DUDE AND WALTER
</b>
<b>---
</b>
They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript 
waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off 
those of the other.  They sit.  They wait.

A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He 
eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's 
army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttHello, gentlemen.  You are the 
ttbereaved?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah man.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttFrancis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet 
ttyou.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttJeffrey Lebowski.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWalter Sobchak.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThe Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.

<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttNothing.

<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttYes.  I understand you're taking 
ttaway the remains.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttWe have the urn.

He nods through a door.  Another man in a black suit enters 
to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop.

<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttAnd I assume this is credit card?

He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk 
to whomever wants to take it.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah.

He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit 
halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head 
pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence.  
The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a 
mortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards 
Donnelly, pointing.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWhat's this?

<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttThat is for the urn.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDon't need it.  We're scattering the 
ttashes.

<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttYes, so we were informed.  However, 
ttwe must of course transmit the remains 
ttto you in a receptacle.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttThis is a hundred and eighty dollars.

<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttYes sir.  It is our most modestly 
ttpriced receptacle.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWell can we--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttA hundred and eighty dollars?!

<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttThey range up to three thousand.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttYeah, but we're--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttCan we just rent it from you?

<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttSir, this is a mortuary, not a rental 
tthouse.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttWe're scattering the fucking ashes!

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWalter--

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttJUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T 
</b><b>ttMEAN WE'RE SAPS!
</b>
<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttSir, please lower your voice--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttHey man, don't you have something 
ttelse you could put it in?

<b>ttttDONNELLY
</b>ttThat is our most modestly priced 
ttreceptacle.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b><b>ttGODDAMNIT!  IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND 
</b><b>ttHERE?!
</b>
<b>POINT DUME -- DAY
</b>
It is a high, wind-swept bluff.  Walter and the Dude walk 
towards the lip of the bluff.  Parked in the background is 
one lonely car, Walter's.

Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic 
lid.  When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly 
for a beat.  Finally:

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttI'll say a few words.

The Dude clasps his hands in front of him.  Walter clears 
his throat.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDonny was a good bowler, and a good 
ttman.  He was. . . He was one of us.  
ttHe was a man who loved the outdoors, 
ttand bowling, and as a surfer explored 
ttthe beaches of southern California 
ttfrom Redondo to Calabassos.  And he 
ttwas an avid bowler.  And a good 
ttfriend.  He died--he died as so many 
ttof his generation, before his time.  
ttIn your wisdom you took him, Lord.  
ttAs you took so many bright flowering 
ttyoung men, at Khe San and Lan Doc 
ttand Hill 364.  These young men gave 
tttheir lives.  And Donny too.  Donny 
ttwho. . . who loved bowling.

Walter clears his throat.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAnd so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, 
ttin accordance with what we think   
ttyour dying wishes might well have 
ttbeen, we commit your mortal remains 
ttto the bosom of.

Walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttthe Pacific Ocean, which you loved 
ttso well.

<b>AS HE SHAKES OUT THE ASHES:
</b>
<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttGoodnight, sweet prince.

The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing 
just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands, 
frozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShit, I'm sorry Dude.

He starts brushing off the Dude with his hands.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttGoddamn wind.

Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping 
Walter's hands away.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttGoddamnit Walter!  You fucking 
ttasshole!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

The Dude is near tears.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou make everything a fucking 
tttravesty!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDude, I'm--it was an accident!

The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhat about that shit about Vietnam!

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttDude, I'm sorry--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttWhat the fuck does Vietnam have to 
ttdo with anything!  What the fuck 
ttwere you talking about?!

Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost 
lost.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttShit Dude, I'm sorry--

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYou're a fuck, Walter!

He gives Walter a weaker shove.  Walter seems dazed, then 
wraps his arms around the Dude.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttAwww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.

<b>THE LANES THE DUDE AND WALTER BOWLING
</b>
We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow 
through--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before.  
They are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his 
bowling shirt.

<b>BAR AREA
</b>
The Dude walks up to the bar.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttTwo oat sodas, Gary.

<b>ttttGARY
</b>ttRight.  Good luck tomorrow.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThanks, man.

<b>ttttGARY
</b>ttSorry to hear about Donny.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you 
tteat the bear, and, uh.

"Tumbling Tumbleweeds" has come up on the jukebox, and The 
Stranger ambles up to the bar.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttHowdy do, Dude.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttOh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered 
ttif I'd see you again.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttWouldn't miss the semis.  How things 
ttbeen goin'?

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttAhh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, 
ttups and downs.

The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttSure, I gotcha.

The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.

<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttThanks, Gary...Take care, man, I 
ttgotta get back.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttSure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know 
ttthat you will.

<b>THE DUDE, LEAVING, NODS:
</b>
<b>ttttDUDE
</b>ttYeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude 
ttabides.

Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttThe Dude abides.

He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into 
the camera.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttI don't know about you, but I take 
ttcomfort in that.  It's good knowin' 
tthe's out there, the Dude, takin' her 
tteasy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I 
ttsure hope he makes The finals.  Welp, 
ttthat about does her, wraps her all 
ttup.  Things seem to've worked out 
ttpretty good for the Dude'n Walter, 
ttand it was a purt good story, dontcha 
ttthink?   Made me laugh to beat the 
ttband.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I 
ttdidn't like seein' Donny go. But 
ttthen, happen to know that there's a 
ttlittle Lebowski on the way.  I guess 
ttthat's the way the whole durned human 
ttcomedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self, 
ttdown through the generations, westward 
ttthe wagons, across the sands a time 
ttuntil-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' 
ttagain.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed 
ttyourselves.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull 
back.

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>ttCatch ya further on down the trail.

As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar.  As his 
voice fades:

<b>ttttTHE STRANGER
</b>tt...Say friend, ya got any more a 
ttthat good sarsaparilla?...
