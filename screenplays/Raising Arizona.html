tIt is mounted on a tripod. A pretty young woman in a severe

tmopping the floor.

</b>ttI was in for writing hot checks which, 
ttwhen businessmen do it, is called an

ttwe were the way we were...

tAt this point the pan has reached the COUNSELOR, an earnest, 
tbearded young man who straddles a folding chair with his 
tarms folded over its back.

tHe is addressing one of the Cons:

</b>ttWhy do you use the word "trapped"?

</b>
tThe huge muscle-bound black man with a shaved head is knitting

ttReagan in the White House...

tHi is getting out of the Chevy in a Hawaiian shirt, holding 
ta pump-action shotgun.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...I dunno, they say he's a decent

tHe primes the shotgun - WHOOSH - CLACK - and heads for the 
tstore.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...maybe his advisers are confused.

</b>
tFull-face exposure of Hi once again in front of the mug-shot 
twall.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttTurn to the right!

tHi obliges but shoots sympathetic glances at Ed who is 
tobviously upset, wiping away tears and snuffling behind the 
tcamera.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttWhat's the matter, Ed?

</b>ttMy fai-ants left me.

</b>
tAs Hi is once again escorted toward his cell.

tThe Mopping Con is now in the middle-background, having worked 
this way about halfway up the corridor since last time we saw 
thim.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttI can't say I was happy to be back

ttsights, sounds and faces almost made 
ttit feel like a homecoming.

<b>tCLOSE ON MOPPING CON
</b>

</b>ttGrrrr...

<b>tPRISON HALL
</b>
tGroup is meeting again.

<b>ttttCOUNSELOR
</b>ttMost men your age, Hi, are getting 
ttmarried and raising up a family. 
ttThey wouldn't accept prison as a 
ttsubstitute.

tHi looks sheepish.

</b>tt...Would any of you men care to 
ttcomment?

tTwo convicts sitting next to each other, GALE and EVELLE, 
tappear to be friends.

ttbefore family.

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttWork is what's kept us happy.

<b>ttttANGRY BLACK CON

ttgotta accept responsibilities. I 
ttmean I'm proud to say I got a 
ttfamily... somewheres.

<b>tHIGH ANGLE CELL
</b>
tLooking down from the ceiling. In the foreground, lying on 
tthe top bunk, hands clasped behind his head as he stares off 
tinto space is MOSES. Moses is a gnarled, elderly black con 
twith wire-rimmed spectacles. On the lower bunk, also with 
thands clasped behind his head and staring off at the same 
tspot in space, is Hi.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttI tried to sort through what the Doc 
tthad said, but prison ain't the easiest 
ttplace to think.

<b>ttttMOSES
</b>ttAn' when they was no meat we ate 
ttfowl. An' when they was no fowl we 
ttate crawdad. An' when they was no 
ttcrawdad to be foun', we ate San'.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttYou ate what?

<b>ttttMOSES
</b>ttt(nodding)
ttWe ate San'.

tHi faces the same three PAROLE OFFICERS across the same table.

<b>ttttCHAIRMAN
</b>ttWell Boy, you done served your twenty

ttreturn you to society.

<b>ttttSECOND MAN
</b>ttThese doors goan swing wide.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttI didn't want to hurt anyone, Sir.

<b>ttttSECOND MAN
</b>ttHi, we respect that.

<b>ttttCHAIRMAN
</b>ttBut you're just hurtin' yourself 
ttwith this rambunctious behavior.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttI know that, sir.

<b>ttttCHAIRMAN
</b>ttOkay then.

<b>tHIGH SHOT
</b>
tOf a 7-Eleven parking lot, at night, deserted except for 
tHi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttNow I don't know how you come down 
tton the incarceration question...

tHi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...whether it's for rehabilitation 
ttor revenge.

tHe spins and grabs his car-door handle. Locked. He tries the 
tback door. Locked.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...But I was beginning to think...

tAs we hear the wail of an approaching siren, Hi takes it on 
tthe heel and toe.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...that revenge is the only argument 
ttmakes any sense.

<b>tFLASH
</b>
tOn Hi against the mug-shot wall.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttTurn to the right!

<b>ttttSHERIFF (O.S.)
</b>ttDon't forget his latents, Ed!

<b>tCLOSE ON HI'S HAND
</b>
tWe see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by Ed's 
ttwo hands: She is rolling each of his inked fingers into the 
tappropriate space on an exemplar sheet.

<b>ttttHI (O.S.)
</b>ttHear about the paddy-wagon collided 
ttwith the segment mixer, Ed? Twelve 
tthardened criminals escaped.

tEd's hand lingers on top of his.  Hi's other hand enters to 
trest on top of hers.

<b>ttttHI (O.S.)
</b>ttGot a new beau?

<b>ttttED (O.S.)
</b>ttNo, Hi, I sure don't.

tHi slips a ring off his own finger and slides it onto Ed's.

<b>ttttHI (O.S.)
</b>ttDon't worry, I paid for it.

<b>tLOW ANGLE CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR
</b>
tThe surly Mopping Con has now worked his way up to the 
tforeground.

tHi is being escorted past him to his cell.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttThey say that absence makes the heart 
ttgrow fonder, and for once they may 
ttbe right.

tHalfway up the corridor Hi points casually at the floor.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttYou missed a spot.

tThe Mopping Con turns to watch him recede.

<b>ttttCON
</b>ttGrrrr...

<b>tHIGH ANGLE CELL
</b>
tSame high shot with Moses on the top bunk, Hi on the lower.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttMore and more my thoughts turned to 
ttEd, and I finally felt the pain of 
ttimprisonment.

<b>ttttMOSES
</b>ttAn' momma would frow the live crawdad 
ttin a pot of boiln' water. Well one 
ttday I decided to make my own 
ttcrawdad...

tWe begin to crane down to tighten on the absently staring 
tHi.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...an' I frew it in a pot, forgettin' 
ttto put in the water, ya see...

tMoses' voice is mixing down as we lose him from frame.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...and it was like I was makin' 
ttpopcorn, ya see... The joint is a 
ttlonely place after lock-up and fights 
ttout...

tWe are now very close on Hi, staring.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...when the last of the cons has 
ttbeen swept away by the sandman.

<b>tHI'S POV
</b>
tThe underside of the top bunk.

tA sudden flash whitens and fades to leave the image of Ed, 
tsmiling behind her camera, softly supered on the underside 
tof the bunk.

<b>tBACK TO HI
</b>
tHe wearily turns his head to profile on the pillow and shuts 
this eyes.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttBut I couldn't help thinking that a 
ttbrighter future lay ahead - a future 
ttthat was only eight to fourteen months 
ttaway.

tEyes closed, he is illuminated by a flash.

<b>tPAROLE BOARD ROOM
</b>
tHi and the same three officers.

<b>ttttCHAIRMAN
</b>ttGot a name for people like you, Hi. 
ttThat name is called recidivism.

<b>ttttSECOND MAN
</b>ttRee-peat O-fender.

<b>ttttCHAIRMAN
</b>ttNot a pretty name, is it, Hi?

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttNo Sir, it sure ain't. That's one

ttanymore.

<b>ttttCHAIRMAN
</b>ttYou're not just tellin' us what we 
ttwanna hear?

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttNo Sir, no way.

</b>ttOkay then.

<b>tTRACKING
</b>
tOver Hi's shoulder as he strides toward a door marked 
t"Processing" and flings it open.

tIt is the familiar booking room. Ed looks up from her camera, 
thaving just snapped a picture of another suspect against the 
thatched wall.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttI'm walkin' in here on my knees, Ed - 
tta free man proposin'.

</b>ttAnd so it was.

<b>ttttSHERIFF (O.S.)
</b>ttDon't forget the boo-kay, Ed!

<b>tCLOSE SHOT ED
</b>
tGazing earnestly into the camera. A congregation is seated 
tbehind her - the bride's side wearing police blues; the 
tgroom's side, Hawaiian shirts.

</b>ttI do.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT HI
</b>

tNext to him idly stands Bud, a veteran of the shop, with a 
tgrimy face and a pair of goggles pushed up on his forehead.

ttend of every day...

<b>tCASHIER'S WINDOW
</b>
tHi is scowling at his paycheck. Behind the barred window a

</b>ttGummint do take a bite, don't she?

<b>tEXT. TRAILER
</b>
tHi sits in a lawn chair in front of the trailer. Ed sits on 
this lap, his arms around her. Both are wearing sunglasses, 
tlooking at the setting sun. The scene is suffused with a 
twarm yellow light.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttThese were the happy days, the salad 
ttdays as they say...

tAs the sun sets, the light is turning from yellow to amber. 
tHi and Ed watch, their heads following its slow downward 
tarc.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...and Ed felt that having a critter 
ttwas the next logical step. It was 
ttall she thought about.

tThe amber is turning to a more neutral dusky light as the 
tsun has set. Hi and Ed continue to stare at the point where 
tit disappeared.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...Her point was that there was too 
ttmuch love and beauty for just the 
tttwo of us...

tThe dusk is slipping away into darkness.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...and every day we kept a child out 
ttof the world was a day he might later 
ttregret having missed.

tWe are by now holding on pitch black. Crickets chirp. From 
tthe darkness:

tEd flies into frame and leaps into his arms, covering him 
twith kisses.

tIn each other's arms, Hi and Ed roll over on the bed.

</b>ttSeemed like nothing could stand in

tWe pan with them rolling and continue off them to the night

tprobably taken by Ed: One shows him full face, the other in 
tprofile.

<b>tEXT. TRAILER TWILIGHT
</b>
tEd sits in a lawn chair knitting a booty. Hi stands in Bermuda

tHis face still deadly neutral, the agent looks back down at

tlathered and half shaved.

</b>ttThe pizazz had gone out of our lives.

<b>tTRAILER BEDROOM
</b>
tThe bedroom is somewhat messy. Ed sits on the edge of the

</b>ttNow y'all who're without sin can 
ttcast the first stone...

tA pull back from the paper shows Hi and Ed reading it together 
tat home. They look from the paper to each other.

tHi opens to an inside page and we pan a row of pictures - 
tthe five tots with their names underneath: "HARRY, BARRY, 
tLARRY, GARRY and NATHAN JR."

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...but we thought it was unfair that 
ttsome should have so many while others 
ttshould have so few.

<b>tBILLBOARD
</b>
tIn the middle of the desert. It reads: "WELCOME TO TEMPE! 
<b>tPOPULATION 13,948... PLUS FIVE!"
</b>
<b>tEXT. TRAILER TWILIGHT
</b>
tWe are floating in toward Ed who is seated, waiting, in the 
tdriver's seat of Hi's Chevy. Hi enters frame and cinches 
tdown a ladder that is tied to the roof of the car. Pieces of 
tred flag flutter at either end of the ladder where it sticks 
tout beyond the car.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttWith the benefit of hindsight maybe 
ttit wasn't such a hot idea...

tHi gets in the car.

<b>tFROM BEHIND THE CHEVY
</b>
tIt starts down the long, winding road leading away from the 
ttrailer, kicking up dust.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...but at the time, Ed's little plan 
ttseemed like the solution to all our 
ttproblems, and the answer to all our 
ttprayers.

tThe title of the film burns in: "RAISING ARIZONA". A building 
tchord snaps off in a shock cut to:

<b>tSUBURBAN LIVING ROOM EVENING
</b>
tTableau of a couple at home. Nathan Arizona is on the 
ttelephone, his stocking feet up on an ottoman. Florence sits 
treading Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care.

tThe living room is dominated by a large oil portrait of Nathan 
tand Florence, gazing out from the wall over the mantelpiece.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttt(into the phone)
ttEight hundred leaf tables and no 
ttchairs?! You can't sell leaf tables 
ttand no chairs! Chairs, you got a 
ttdinette set! No chairs, you got dick! 
ttI ask my wife she got more sense!...

<b>tTITLE IS SUPERED:
</b>
<b>t"THE ARIZONA HOUSEHOLD"
</b>
tFrom somewhere upstairs we hear an infant start to cry. 
tFlorence stops reading and looks up at the ceiling. Nathan 
tis oblivious.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>tt...Miles, all I know is I'm away 
ttfrom the office to have me some kids 
ttand everything goes straight to heck! 
ttI ain't gonna stand for it!

tAnother title is supered below the first: "SEPTEMBER 17, 
t1985". The baby stops crying and Florence's attention returns 
tto her book.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...Yeah, and if a frog had wings he 
ttwouldn't bump his ass a-hoppin'! I'm 
ttsick of your excuses, Miles! It is 
ttnow...

tAs he throws out his wrist to look at his watch a third title 
tis supered beneath the first two: 8:45 p.m.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...8:45 in the p.m. I'm gonna be 
ttdown to the store in exactly twelve 
tthours to kick me some butt!

tHe starts to replace the receiver but brings it back with an 
tafterthought:

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...Or my name ain't Nathan Arizona!

tAs he slams the phone into the cradle the titles disappear. 
tAnother baby starts crying. Florence looks up at the ceiling.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttThat sounds like Larry.

tClose on the crying baby as Hi bounces it, gently but 
tdesperately.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttShhhh! Shh! Nice baby...

tHe starts to lower it back into the crib. The crib is 
tunpainted with the name of each baby burned Bonanza-style 
tinto the headboard: Harry, Barry, Larry, Garry, and Nathan 
tJr. Instead of quieting as he is lowered into the crib, the 
tsqualling baby only sets off one of his brothers. Hi hurriedly 
tlifts him back out.

tHe looks desperately around the room.

tThe room is wallpapered with nursery rhyme characters.

tThere are toys strewn around. There is one adult-sized easy 
tchair in the corner.

tHi carries the baby over to the chair, stepping on and 
treacting to the squeal of a squeeze-me toy on the way. He 
tsits the baby deep in - the chair and then returns to the 
tcrib to deal with the second crying baby.

tHe lifts the baby out of the crib and gently bounces it. 
tThis baby stops crying.

tAnother one in the crib starts bawling.

tHi sets the second baby down on the floor and gives it a 
trattle to keep it pacified. He reaches for the third baby in 
tthe crib. Sweat stands out on Hi 's brow. He is desperately 
tchucking the third baby under the chin when we hear a muffled 
<b>tPTHUMP!
</b>
tHe whirls to look across the darkened room.

tThe first baby has dropped off the easy chair and is 
tenergetically crawling away toward a shadowy corner.

<b>tLIVING ROOM
</b>
tNathan and Florence are sitting stock-still, staring at the 
tceiling. After a moment, another baby starts crying.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttWhat're they, playing telephone?

tThey stare at the ceiling.

<b>tNURSERY
</b>
tLoose babies are crawling everywhere. Hi is skittering across 
tthe room in a half-crouch, a baby tucked under one arm, 
treaching out with the other as he pursues a crawling baby 
tacross the room.

tHe hefts the other baby with his free arm and brings the air 
tback to the crib.

tHe turns to look frantically around the room.

tThe other three babies have disappeared.

tThere is perfect quiet.

tHi goes over to the closet door, which is ajar, and swings 
tit open.

tHe reaches under a moving pile of clothes on the floor and 
tpulls out a baby.

tHe returns it to the crib and freezes, listening.

tThe sound of a rattle.

tHe drops to the floor to look under the crib.

<b>tWIDE ANGLE UNDER CRIB
</b>
tA baby holding a rattle leers into the camera in the 
tforeground. Behind him Hi, on his stomach, is reaching in to 
tgrab at his leg.

tHi is pulling the baby out, away from the camera, when with 
ta plop! a baby drops onto Hi 's back from the crib above.

tHi twists one arm back to grope for the baby crawling on top 
tof him.

tHe is straightening up, a baby in each arm, when he reacts 
tin horror to something he sees across the room.

<b>tHI'S POV
</b>
tThe hindquarters of a diapered baby are just disappearing 
taround the corner of the nursery door into the hallway.

<b>tLIVING ROOM
</b>
tFlorence and Nathan are staring at the ceiling. After a beat 
twe hear a muffled plop! on the ceiling. A beat later, the 
tbleat of the squeeze-me toy.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>tt...Whyn't you go up and check on 
tt'em?

tThey sound restless.

<b>tUPSTAIRS HALLWAY
</b>
tThe floor-level wide-angle shot shows a baby crawling toward 
tthe camera in the foreground. Behind him, in the background, 
tjust rounding the open door from the nursery, yet another 
tbaby is making a mad dash for freedom.

tHi emerges from the nursery and, stepping around the 
tbackground baby, trots toward the baby in the foreground. By 
tthe time he reaches it the low-angle cropping shows us only 
this feet and calves.

<b>tCLOSE ON HI
</b>
tPerspiring as he tiptoes the last two steps to the baby.

<b>tHI'S POV
</b>
tThe baby and, beyond it, the stairway down to the main floor. 
tWe hear footsteps approaching.

<b>tBACK TO HI
</b>
tHe scoops up the baby and hurriedly tiptoes away toward the 
tnursery.

<b>tLOW-ANGLE REVERSE
</b>
tThe baby at the nursery door in the foreground; the staircase 
tin the background. As Hi reaches the baby we hear footsteps 
tclimbing the stairs.

tHi's free arm comes down into frame to scoop the baby up and 
tout of frame just as:

tFlorence's head appears, bobbing up as she climbs the stairs.

tShe approaches the nursery, still clutching the Dr. Spock 
tbook.

<b>tNURSERY
</b>
tAs Florence enters from the hallway door.

tWe track back into the room, on her, as she approaches the 
tcrib. Halfway there she freezes, staring, in shock.

<b>tHER POV
</b>
tAll of the babies have been replaced in the crib but not 
tlying down: They are seated in a row, staring back at her, 
tlined up against the far crib railing, like a small but 
tdistinguished panel on "Meet the Press."

<b>tTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE CHEVY
</b>
tED'S POV of Hi approaching the car. He is shrugging and 
tdisplaying a pair of manifestly empty hands.

<b>tCLOSE ON ED
</b>
tBarely able to fight down her anger. Hissing:

<b>ttttED
</b>ttWhat's the matter?!

tHi appears at her - the driver's-window.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttSorry honey, it just didn't work 
ttout.

tHe is reaching to open the door but she slaps his hand away 
tfrom the handle.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttWhat d'you mean it didn't work out?!

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttThey started cryin', then they were 
ttall over me...

tHe is trying to open the door, which Ed is holding shut with 
tall her might.

<b>ttttHI
</b>tt...It was kinda horrifying - Lemme 
ttin, honey.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttCourse they cried! Babies cry!

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttI know that now! Come on honey, we

tEd is rolling up the window and locking the door.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttYou go right back up there and get 
ttme a toddler! I need a baby, Hi; 
ttthey got more'n they can handle!

tMuffled, through the closed window, and very forlorn:

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttAw honey I -

<b>ttttED
</b>ttDon't you come back here without a 
ttbaby!

<b>tNURSERY
</b>
tFlorence is holding one of the babies cradled against her 
tshoulder. She is facing the hallway door; her back is to the 
tcrib and window. The baby, peeping out over her shoulder, is 
tfacing the window.

<b>tCLOSE ON BABY
</b>
tLooking.

<b>tBABY'S POV
</b>
tOf the window, as Hi's head appears in it.

tLooking back, he holds a finger to his lips.

</b>
tHi and the window bouncing up and down.

tNathan is leafing through the lingerie ads in the newspaper.

tWe can hear Florence's returning footsteps. Muttering:

</b>ttChristian Dior my butt...

tFlorence enters.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>tt...They pay money for that?

<b>ttttFLORENCE
</b>ttYes dear.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttHow're the kids?

<b>ttttFLORENCE
</b>ttFine dear.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttFuckin' kids, I love 'em.

tWe hear the bleat of the squeeze-me toy. Florence and Nathan 
tlook at the ceiling for a beat, then Nathan clears his throat 
tand returns to the newspaper.

<b>tCHEVY
</b>
tEd sits anxiously waiting in the driver's seat, peering 
tintently through the windshield. As she catches sight of 
tsomething she breaks into a broad smile, unlocks the door, 
tand slides over to the passenger seat.

tHi is opening the door with one hand, cradling a baby in the 
tother.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttWhich one ya get?

tAs he gets into the driver's seat:

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttI dunno. Nathan Jr., I think.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttGimme here.

tHe hands her the infant, then hands her the copy of Dr.Spock's 
tBaby and Child Care.

</b>ttOh, he's beautiful!

tHi nods as he pulls away from the curb.

</b>ttYeah. This one's awful damn good

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttWell a course she'll be upset, sugar, 
ttbut she'll get over it. She's got 
ttfour little babies almost as good as

tEd suddenly bursts out crying.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttI love him so much!

</b>ttI know you do, honey.

</b>ttt(still sobbing)
ttI love him so much!

<b>tTRAILER LIVING ROOM

tA string of cut-out letters reads "Welcome Home Son!"

<b>ttttHI (O.S.)
</b>ttOkay, bring him in!

</b>
tEd is entering with Nathan Jr.

ttHe's all right, he is.

tHe reaches for the child.

<b>ttttHI
</b>tt...Come on over here, Nathan Jr., 
ttI'll show you around.

tHe takes the baby in both hands and holds him out at arm's 
tlength, pointing him at the various places of interest. The 
tbaby looks goggle-eyed at each one.

<b>ttttHI
</b>tt...Lookahere, young sportsman. That - 
ttthere's the kitchen area where Ma

tImpatient with the nonsense:

<b>ttttED
</b>ttHe's tired, Hi.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttWell we'll just sit you right there, 
ttboy...

tHe is propping Nathan Jr. up in the corner of the couch. Hi 
tsits at the other corner and Ed sits in a facing chair.

<b>ttttHI
</b>tt...Just put those dogs up'n take a 
ttload off.

tHi beams at Nathan Jr. Ed smiles at Nathan Jr. Nathan Jr. 
tlooks from one to the other, deadpan. They seem to be waiting 
tfor him to contribute to the conversation.

tSilence.

tSuddenly Hi slaps his knee.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttWhat are you kiddin'?! We got a family 
tthere!

tEd is getting up.

<b>ttttHI
</b>tt...He's a scandal, honey! He's a

tAs she picks up the baby:

<b>ttttED
</b>ttHe's a good boy.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttHe ain't too good! You can tell by 
ttthat twinkle in his eye!

<b>ttttED
</b>ttDon't you think we should put him to

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttHang on, honey...

tHe is frantically reaching for a Polaroid camera.

<b>ttttHI
</b>tt...Let's us preserve the moment in

<b>ttttED
</b>ttJust one, okay?...

tShe sits down on the couch with Nathan Jr. as Hi starts 
tscrewing the camera into a tripod.

<b>ttttED
</b>tt...I gotta tell ya, I'm a little

tAbsently, as he sets up the camera:

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttHow come is that, honey?

<b>ttttED
</b>ttWell we got a baby, Hi. It's an awful 
ttbig responsibility.

tAs he peers through the lens:

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttHoney, could ya slide over a tad and

tAs she complies:

<b>ttttED
</b>ttI mean we never done this before and 
ttI'm kinda nervous.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttYou're doin' real good, sugar.

tHi sits on the couch, holding the camera's cable release. He 
tputs his arm around Ed and smiles at the offscreen camera.

tEd nestles her head against Hi's shoulder.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttI love you, Hi.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttWe're set to pop here, honey.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttYou're gonna help, aren't ya?

tThrough his teeth as he continues to grin at the offscreen 
tcamera:

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttHow's that, honey?

<b>ttttED
</b>ttGive Nathan Jr. a normal family 
ttbackground, just quiet evenings at

tWe begin to hear distant thunder.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttYou can count on it, honey.

<b>ttttED
</b>tt...Everything decent'n normal from

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttUh-huh.

tAs he squeezes the cable release - FLASH - the image 
tmomentarily freezes on Hi beaming, Nathan Jr. staring, and 
tEd looking at Hi with a little bit of concern.

<b>tDARK FIELD SAME NIGHT
</b>
tThe rolling thunder has built to a thunderclap at the cut, 
tand the flash of the Polaroid match cuts to lightning throwing 
ta momentarily harsh glare on the field.

tRain beats down on the bare patch of ground we are looking 
tat - by now just a patch of mud.

tFaraway lightning flickers and we hear the rumble of more 
tthunder approaching, then suddenly:

tTHWACK - A head pops up out of the mud. It is Gale, the con 
twe saw in group therapy. He bellows as lightning and thunder 
tflash and crack nearby.

tHis head is covered with mud, although the driving rain is 
talready starting to wash it away.

tWe are beginning to track in an arc around Gale's head, who 
tis now struggling, working to get his shoulders and arms up 
tout of the mud. The end of the 180-degree arc and a flash of 
tlightning reveal, way in the distance, the wire-topped walls 
tof a penitentiary.

tStill bellowing, as if in some primal rage, Gale has gotten 
this muck-covered arms up out of the earth and is now pushing 
tdown to haul up the rest of his body. It comes with much 
teffort, and with the loud sucking-popping sounds of the 
tfiercely clinging mud.

tFinally he is free.

tWith a great cry, the mud-covered man plunges his right arm 
tstraight back down into the earth, all the way up to his 
tshoulder. He gropes intently and then, apparently having 
tgrabbed hold of something underground, he starts pulling.

tHis arm comes slowly back up out of the mud. Clasped in his 
thand is - a human foot.

tBellowing with effort he continues to pull, liberating the 
tfoot... leg... torso of his companion, and finally his head.

tAs the rain starts to wash the mud off his companion's head 
twe see that it is his friend Evelle.

tBoth are bellowing.

tMud sucks and pops.

tThunder crashes.

<b>tINT. GAS STATION MENS ROOM
</b>
tAt the cut the ear-splitting thunder drops out to quiet. We 
thear only the muffled patter of rain and the hum of a bare 
tfluorescent.

tThe two bedraggled escaped cons are standing side by side, 
tcombing their hair in the mirror. The men seem absorbed in 
ttheir task, using hair jelly from a jar that sits on the 
tshelf between them to restore their duck's-ass haircuts.

tEvelle cracks the bathroom door and looks out into the rain.

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>tt...Okay.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttWhat is it?

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttMercury. Looks nice.

<b>tEXT. GAS STATION
</b>
tThe two men are trotting out to a Mercury that sits untended 
tat a gas island, a gas hose on automatic stuck in its tank.

tAs Gale starts up the car Evelle yanks the hose out and drops 
tit to the ground. Gale is already starting to peel out as 
tEvelle gets in.

<b>tWIDE SHOT TRAILER LIVING ROOM

tLate at night. Hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of

tWe hear faint, distant knocking. As we track in toward Hi 
tthe knocking becomes louder and more present.

tAs we approach Hi we see that several Polaroids are spread 
tover his gently rising and falling chest.

tBy the time we tighten on his face the knocking has become 
tquite loud.

<b>ttttVOICE

tHi starts awake with a grunt.

tHe sits up and tenses. He looks around.

tEd stands in her nightgown at the mouth of the hallway,

</b>ttHi! What's goin' on?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttPo-lice, son! Open her up!

tHi gets to his feet, hurriedly tosses the Polaroids under a

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttWaaaal...

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttWe released ourselves on our own 
ttrecognizance.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttWhat Evelle means to say is, we felt 
ttthe institution no longer had anything 
ttto offer us.

tHe is looking at the baby.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tt...My Lord he's cute.

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttHe's a little outlaw, you can see 
ttthat.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttNow listen, you folks can't stay 
tthere!

tGale, Evelle, and Hi look up at Ed, dumbstruck. After a beat:

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>tt...Ma'am?

<b>ttttED
</b>ttYou just can't stay! I appreciate 
ttyour bein' friends of Hi and all, 
ttbut this is a decent family now...

tShe looks at Hi.

<b>ttttED
</b>tt...I mean we got a toddler here!

tGale leans in close to Hi, a look of sincere concern on his 
tface, and says under his breath:

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttSay, who wears the pants round here 
<b>ttH.I.?
</b>
<b>ttttHI
</b>ttNow honey -

<b>ttttED
</b>ttDon't you honey me. Now you boys can 
ttset a while and catch up, and then 
ttyou'll be on your way.

tThere is an awkward silence as she leaves and slams the 
tbedroom door.

tGale is carefully studying his thumbnail; Evelle stares 
tfixedly at the ceiling. Still looking at his thumb:

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttGotcha on a awful short leash, don't 
ttshe H.I.?

<b>tBEDROOM
</b>
tSometime later, as Hi tiptoes in. Ed lies in bed facing the 
twall; we see only the back of her head. Hi sits gingerly on 
tthe edge of the bed and, smiling, sticks a finger through 
tthe bars of the crib to play with the baby.

tThe sound of the TV set in the living room filters faintly 
tin.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttThey still here?

tHi is momentarily startled, then goes on playing with the 
tbaby.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttYeah, they're just gonna stay a day 
ttor two. It's raining out honey, they 
ttgot nowhere to go.

tEd finally turns to face him. We hear the two men laugh 
traucously in the living room.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttThey're fugitives, Hi...

tHi turns to face her.

<b>ttttED
</b>tt...How're we gonna start a new life 
ttwith them around?

</b>ttWell now honey you gotta have a little

<b>ttttED
</b>ttPromise just a day or two.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttTonight and tomorrow, tops.

<b>tEXTREME HIGH ANGLE
</b>
tLooking straight down at Hi, asleep in bed. It is later: 
tfiltering softly in from the other room is the end of the 
t"Star Spangled Banner" on TV. We are craning down.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttThat night I had a dream.

<b>tFLASH CUT
</b>
tFor a brief moment we see a wall of flames and hear it roar.

<b>tBACK TO HI
</b>
tStill craning down.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...I'd drifted off thinkin' about 
tthappiness, birth, and new life...

<b>tFLASH CUT
</b>
tWall of flames. Deafening roar.

<b>tBACK TO HI
</b>
tCraning down. The faint National Anthem ends: we hear the 
tWEEEEEEEE of a test pattern.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttBut now I was haunted by a vision of -

<b>tWALL OF FLAMES
</b>
tRoaring. At the cut: WHOOOOOSH! a huge low-rider motorcycle 
tbursts through the flames, its engine roaring even louder 
tthan the fire. Its driver is a huge leather-clad hellion.

tThe chains worn by the Biker clank ominously as he rides.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttHe was horrible...

tThe Biker roars out of frame.

<b>tLOW-ANGLE REVERSE
</b>
tAs the Biker roars into frame, his rear tire laying down a 
twake of fire.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...a lone biker of the apocalypse...

<b>tTRACKING ON BIKER
</b>
tAs he roars along a ribbon of desert highway.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...a man with all the powers of her 
ttat his command.

tThe Biker reaches for his bullwhip.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...He could turn the day into night...

tThe Biker cracks the whip and, at the crack:

tThe sky behind him turns instantly to black. Bolts of 
tlightning crackle across it as thunder roars.

<b>tANOTHER DESERT SCENE DAY
</b>
tTracking with and also in on the Biker from behind as he 
troars along a strip of highway. He is reaching for the two 
tsawed-off shotguns which are strapped crisscross across his 
tback.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...and laid to waste everything in 
tthis path.

<b>tREVERSE TRACK ON BIKER
</b>
tPulling the Biker from a distance as he levels the two 
tshotguns. The tracking camera pulls back further to reveal a 
trunning jack-rabbit keeping pace with us in the foreground.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttHe was especially hard on the little 
ttthings...

tCRACK - as the first shotgun spurts orange the foreground 
trabbit keels over. The Biker slues the other gun around.

<b>tLOCKED-DOWN WIDE SHOT
</b>
tOn a rock in the foreground, a desert lizard suns himself.

tThe Biker is approaching in the distant background.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...the helpless and the gentle 
ttcreatures.

tCRACK - from afar, the foreground lizard is blown away.

<b>tLOCKED-DOWN LOW-ANGLE WIDE SHOT
</b>
tOf the empty desert road stretching away. In the foreground 
ta lone desert flower blooms.

tThe Biker roars into frame.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttHe left a scorched earth in his wake, 
ttbefouling even the sweet desert breeze 
ttthat whipped across his brow.

tAs the Biker roars away, the foreground flower bends with 
this draft and then bursts into flame.

<b>tTRACKING ON BIKER
</b>
tFrom in front. He twirls the shotguns in either hand and 
treaches back to plunge them over his shoulders into their 
tholsters.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttI didn't know where he came from or 
ttwhy...

tWe are moving in on his chest, where two crisscrossed 
tbandoliers carry two rows of hand grenades, their silver 
tpins glinting in the sun. We follow the line of one of the 
tbandoliers up to his right shoulder which bears the tattoo: 
t"Mama Didn't Love Me."

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttI didn't know if he was dream or 
ttvision...

<b>tREVERSE TRACK ON BIKER
</b>
tFrom behind, booming down as we track. We are approaching 
tthe crest of a rise.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttBut I feared that I myself had 
ttunleashed him...

<b>tHIGH SHOT
</b>
tOf the Biker approaching, craning down as he draws near.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...for he was The Fury That Would 
ttBe...

tWith the crane down we momentarily lose him from view over 
tthe rise; then suddenly - ROAR - he tops the rise and, wheels 
tspinning, is airborne

<b>tREVERSE
</b>
tAs he crashes back down to earth in the foreground and roars 
taway. Only now we are no longer in the desert:

tWe are looking down a twilight street at the end of which is 
tthe Arizona house.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...as soon as Florence Arizona found 
tther little Nathan gone.

tThe roar of his engine and clank of his chains recede as the 
tBiker gradually dissolves into thin air.

tWe are left looking at the empty street and the faraway 
tArizona house.

tThe receding roar has left behind eerily beautiful singing, 
ta woman singing a lullaby. Faintly, behind the singing, there 
tis also a droning high-pitched noise.

tThe camera starts floating forward very close to the ground, 
tmoving slowly toward the Arizona house. The high-pitched 
tdrone is becoming less faint under the singing.

tThe camera is accelerating. The drone is growing louder - we 
tcan now tell that it is a human scream.

tAs we approach the Arizona house we can see that a ladder is 
tpropped up to a second-story window.

tWe are moving quite fast now. The scream all but buries the 
tsinging.

tWe are rushing toward the house, toward the base of the 
tladder, the sustained scream drawing us on.

tWe hurtle toward and then straight up the ladder with no 
tabatement of speed, sucked forward by the deafening scream.

tWe reach the top and hurtle - THWAP! - through the white 
tcurtains of the open second-story window into the nursery to 
treveal Florence Arizona, her back to us, screaming over the 
tcrib.

tWe are rocketing toward her.

tShe is turning to us, hands pressed to her ears, mouth 
tstretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek and we are rushing 
tinto an extreme close-up of her gaping mouth and her wildly 
tvibrating epiglottis and we

<b>ttttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF HI'S EYES
</b>
tAs they snap open.

tThe screaming snaps off at the cut. The singing that the 
tbuilding scream covered, however, is now audible again.

tPerspiration beads Hi's forehead. He looks down toward the 
tfoot of the bed.

<b>tTHE BEDROOM
</b>
tIt is now morning. Ed walks back and forth, gently bouncing 
tthe baby as she walks. She is singing it a lullaby.

tFaintly, from the next room, we can hear Gale and Evelle 
tsnoring away like buzz saws.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttt(groggily)
ttHe all right?

<b>ttttED
</b>ttHe's all right. He was just havin' a 
ttnightmare.

tHi is getting out of bed.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttYeah, well...

tHe crosses to the bedroom window and cracks the venetian 
tblind. Orange light filters in.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tBeyond a clothes line and a septic tank, a huge orange ball 
tof sun is rising. We can almost hear the roar of its burning 
tsurface.

<b>tBACK TO HI
</b>
tLooking.

<b>ttttHI
</b>tt...Sometimes it's a hard world for 
ttlittle things.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe orange sun, rumbling, perceptibly rising.

<b>tARIZONA HOME FRONT FOYER
</b>
tAt the cut the rumble of the sun is snapped off by the high-
tpitched ba-WEEEEeeee... of a strobe going off as a flash 
tpicture is taken: We are looking over Nathan Jr.'s shoulder 
tas he stands at his open front door, facing a battery of 
tpress people who stand out on the porch.

tAn obie light over a local TV news camera glares in at us; 
tvarious flashbulbs pop.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttNo, the missus and the rest of the

</b>ttDo you have anything to say to the

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttYeah: Watch yer butt.

</b>ttSir, it's been rumored that your son

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttt(sadly)
ttNow don't print that, son. If his

tA POLICEMAN from inside the house is taking Nathan by the 
telbow.

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttWe really have to ask you some more 
ttquestions, sir...

tAs Nathan allows himself to be led back into the house he 
tcalls back over his shoulder:

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttBut remember, it's still business as 
ttusual at Unpainted Arizona, and if 
ttyou can find lower prices anywhere 
ttmy name still ain't Nathan Arizona!

tWe are following the two, hand-held, as the Police leads 
tNathan toward the living room.

<b>tLIVING ROOM
</b>
tThe room is filled with policemen milling about in several 
tdifferent uniforms: local police, state troopers, plainclothes 
tdetectives.

tThe original Policeman is leading Nathan to a table where a 
twhite-smocked technician is preparing inkpad and exemplar 
tsheets.

tThe dialogue is urgent, rapid-fire and overlapping.

<b>ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttMr. Byrum here can take your exemplars 
ttwhile you talk.

tMR. BYRUM has taken Nathan's right hand and is rolling its 
tfingers onto the inkpad.

<b>ttttBYRUM
</b>ttJust let your hand relax; I'll do 
ttthe work.

tNathan jerks his hand away.

<b>ttttNATHAN

tTwo men in conservative suits are approaching.

tAlso raising his voice at the offscreen bellower:

tHe is rising to his feet and hurling the coat to the floor.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>tt...No leads?!

tHe furiously kicks the coat.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>tt...Everyone leaves microbes'n whatnot!

tThroughout the speech Nathan stalks the room, working himself 
tinto a frenzy, furiously putting coffee cups onto coasters, 
tgenerally cleaning up, hectoring the police, and swiping 
ttheir feet off his furniture.

ttthe difference between a lead and a 
tthole in the ground!!

<b>tHOLE IN THE GROUND - DAY
</b>
tSpecifically, it is the hole in the muddy patch of earth 
tthat Gale and Evelle climbed out of. We hear only the squish - 
tsuck of many feet walking around in the mud offscreen.

tWe are pulling back to reveal the feet-the shiny black patent 
tleather shoes and blue pants cuffs - becoming quickly 
tspattered - of several policemen milling about the hole.

tGerman shepherds sniff around also.

tWith a roar, motorcycle wheels enter frame. The bike's 
tjackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once; police 
tstep back and dogs skitter away to give him room.

tHe backs toward the camera and stops, standing astride the 
tbike. The burning stub of a cheroot is dropped into frame; 
tit hisses angrily and dies in the mud. We start to crane up.

tThe whipcracking Biker cue mixes up. The Biker's motorcycle 
tidles with a deep rumble, like the roar of fire on the sun.

tWe are now framed looking over the Biker's shoulder. The 
tpolicemen's attitude to him seems to be deferential. One cop 
tin front of him is pointing a direction. The Biker is shaking 
this head; he doesn't think they went that way.

tSuddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the Biker's head 
tsnaps to profile. He is staring across the field, stock-still, 
thaving heard, smelled or sensed something.

tThe dogs milling around the hole also react, snapping to 
tattention, a split second after the BIKER.

<b>tTHEIR POV
</b>
tA jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field.

<b>tTHE DOGS
</b>
tAfter a moment, their attention returns to the hole.

<b>tTHE BIKER
</b>
tHis attention also returns to the matter at hand. He squints, 
tconcentrating. His bike rumbles. Gradually his face sets in 
ta specific direction.

tWe pan down to the tattoo on his shoulder: "Mama Didn't Love 
tMe." His shoulder flexes once or twice as he revs the 
tthrottle; then he puts the bike in gear and it roars out of 
tframe.

<b>tTRAILER KITCHEN CLOSE ON GALE AND EVELLE
</b>
tThey are both intently munching cornflakes, staring at 
tsomething offscreen. After a beat:

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>tt...Awful good cereal flakes, Miz 
ttMcDunnough.

<b>tTHEIR POV
</b>
tEd is sitting in the living room, bottle-feeding Nathan Jr. 
tShe is surrounded by the rumpled sheets and blankets used by 
tthe house guests. She does not respond to the ice-breaker.

tGale puts his spoon down and picks up a cigarette which has 
tbeen smoking in the ashtray next to him. There is a bead of 
tmilk dribbling down his chin.

tHe takes a contemplative puff, studying Ed.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tt...Whyncha breast feed him? You 'pear 
ttto be capable.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttMind your own bidnis.

tThrough a mouthful of cornflakes:

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttYa don't breast feed him, he'll hate 
ttyou for it later. That's why we wound 
ttup in prison.

tGale blows out smoke and picks up his spoon to start back in 
ton his cornflakes.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttAnyway, that's what Doc Schwartz 
tttells us.

tHi is walking in, yawning.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttBoys.

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttMorni', H.I.

tSharply, as Hi sits and starts to pour cornflakes into a 
tbowl:

<b>ttttED
</b>tt...Hi.

tHi holds the cornflakes box arrested in mid-air. He looks at 
tEd, who is motioning to gale and Evelle with her eyes.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttOh yeah... Say boys, you wouldn't 
ttmind makin' yourself scarce for a 
ttcouple hours this afternoon?

<b>ttttED
</b>ttWe're havin' some decent friends

<b>tBACK TO HI
</b>
tFeeling the look, he goes back to his cornflakes.

<b>ttttHI

ttSo many social engagements. So little 
tttime.

<b>tWIDE SHOT GAS STATION BATHROOM
</b>
tIt is the bathroom where we earlier saw Gale and Evelle 
tcombing their hair, now empty.

tWe are looking toward the door. The bathroom is quiet except 
tfor the dripping sink, and the faint rumble of an approaching 
tmotorcycle. It grows louder, then begins to recede as the 
tbike shoots by the station.

tSuddenly we hear the screech of the bike's brakes.

<b>tEXT. THE STATION
</b>
tWe are on the road outside the gas station as the motorcycle 
tscreeches to a halt in the foreground. The low wide shot 
tcrops the BIKER at his shins. In the background behind him 
tis the gas station.

tThe Biker pauses for a moment, thinking or feeling.

<b>tBACK TO INT. BATHROOM
</b>
tWe hear the rumble of the bike approaching, very loud.

tCRASH - the bathroom door flies open as the Biker bursts in 
tastride his hog, bright daylight streaming in with him to 
tthrow him into imposing silhouette. The shafts of light 
tpouring in are defined by motes of dust dancing in the air.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tFast track in on the jar of hair jelly sitting on the shelf 
tunder the mirror.

<b>tBACK TO BIKER

tAn extreme close shot shows his nostrils dilating as we hear 
thim sniff.

tHe revs the rumbling bike, stealing thunder from a far 
tmountain.

</b>ttWhere's at baby? Where's he at?

tFrom behind, Glen gives her an energetic THWOK on the ass.

<b>ttttGLEN
</b>ttGo find him honey!

tDot spins and smacks Glen across the face with her purse.

tThrough clenched teeth:

</b>ttCut it out, Glen!

tHe reels under the blow.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttHe's asleep right now.

tDot shrieks again, but this time muffles it with her own

tGlen, rubbing his cheek, seems angry at himself.

<b>ttttGLEN
</b>ttShit, I hope we didn't wake it!

<b>ttttDOT
</b>ttCan I just sneak a peek-a-loo?

tGlen at the top of the stoop, turns out to the yard.

<b>tTRAILER LIVING ROOM / KITCHEN
</b>
tThe weaving knee-level tracking shot is following a six-year-
told boy in shorts and a dirty T-shirt as he tramps around 
tthe trailer, brandishing a big stick. He strikes the walls, 
tfurniture, various other objects with his stick, hollering 
t"Bam! Bam-Bam!" with each blow.

tThe track weaves off him and onto Hi, who is bending down to 
tpull a couple of beers from the refrigerator. He raises his 
tvoice to make himself heard over the din of all the children 
tboiling around the room:

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttNeed a beer, Glen?

</b>ttDoes the Pope wear a funny hat?

tHi considers this.

tOne of Glen's children, in a cowboy hat, is squirting a squirt

</b>ttNope, it takes three!

tHe starts laughing, then catches himself.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttI don't know, Glen.

tHi looks over at the TV, which the bam-shouting six-year-old

<b>ttttHI

thamburgers, rolls, green jello mold, cooler, etc.

tOne of the younger children sits in the middle of the table, 
toccasionally taking a fistful of jello and flinging it at 
tHi. The two women don't seem to notice.

</b>tt...and then there's diphtheria-

tat his neck and his arms below the short-sleeve line, which 
tare a bright angry red.

</b>ttNow the thing about Dot is, she thinks- 
ttand she's told me this-

tHe looks around as if to make sure they are not being

tGlen's jaw.

tGlen's feet leave the ground. He flies back and lands in a

tA pimply-faced lad with a paper 7-Eleven cap on his head. He 
tis looking up from a dirty magazine, reacting in horror to 
tsomething approaching.

<b>tHI'S POV
</b>
tHi is approaching the check-out island with a gun in one 
thand, the carton of Huggies tucked under the other. The L'Eggs 
tstocking is pulled over his head to distort his features.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttI'll be taking these Huggies and

<b>ttttED
</b>tt"Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-

tShe pauses for a moment, listening. We can barely hear a 
tdistant siren. She resumes absently, but her voice trails 
toff.

<b>ttttED
</b>tt"...and I'll blow your house in..."

tWe can definitely hear the WHOO-WHOO of the siren now, and 
tit is definitely approaching. Ed hooks an arm around the 
tseat and looks behind the car, then looks forward.

<b>tHER POV
</b>
tIndistinctly visible through the semi-reflective glass are 
ttwo figures at the check-out island. One is pointing something 
tat the other.

<b>tBACK TO ED
</b>
tAs the siren is growing louder. Under her breath:

tthe front of the car.

tHer shout is muffled through the glass:

</b>ttYou son-of-a-bitch!

tWith this Hi notices her. He turns to the Cashier.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttBetter hurry it up. I'm in dutch 
ttwith the wife.

tBut Ed is already getting into the driver's seat of the car.

<b>tBACK TO ED
</b>
tAs she slams the car door shut. The siren is quite loud now.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttThat son-of-a-bitch. Hang on, pumpkin.

tThe car squeals out of the lot.

<b>tWIDE SHOT THE STREET
</b>
tThe squad car tops a rise to bounce into view, its siren 
twailing.

<b>tBACK TO THE STORE
</b>
tHi bursts out the door, still wearing the stocking. The carton 
tof Huggies is still tucked under one arm.

tBellowing hopefully after his departing car:

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttHoney!

tWe hear the SMACK-CRACK of a gunshot and glass impact, but 
tthe approaching squad car is still too far down the block to 
thave been the source.

tHi looks around the parking lot, bewildered.

tThe wailing siren is becoming painfully loud.

tHi looks behind him at the plate-glass front of the store, 
twhere a bullet pock mars the glass.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThrough the glass we see the pimply young Cashier with the 
tpaper 7-Eleven cap pop up from behind the counter to sight 
tdown his huge .44 Magnum for another shot. The gun is so big 
the uses both hands to heft it.

tSMACK-CRACK - the bullet kisses another hole in the glass.

tHi is off and running.

tThe squad car is screeching into the lot. An officer tumbles 
tout of the passenger side before the car is fully stopped. 
tHe rolls on the pavement, then hurriedly rights himself and 
ttakes up a half-kneeling shooting stance.

tAt the same time the little Cashier is emerging from the 7-
tEleven with his gun.

tThe two bang away at Hi's retreating figure - the Policeman's 
trevolver popping, the Cashier's Magnum booming.

tWe hear the Policeman who is still in the car drawling over 
tits loudspeaker:

<b>ttttSPEAKER
</b>ttHalt. It's a police warning, son. 
ttPut those groceries down and turn 
ttyourself in.

<b>tTRACKING ON HI
</b>
tLegs pumping, panty hose still over his head, its unused leg 
tstreaming behind him like an aviator's scarf. The gun is 
ttucked into his belt; the Huggies are tucked securely under 
this arm.

tBehind him we can see the OFFICER and the Cashier squeeze 
toff another couple shots, and then the policeman piles back 
tinto the squad car.

<b>tED'S CAR
</b>
tDriving. She hears distant gunshots.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttThat son of a bitch... Hold on, 
ttNathan. We're gonna go pick up Daddy.

tShe hangs a vicious U-turn.

<b>tTRACKING ON HI
</b>
tHuffing and puffing down the road with his Huggies.

tThe cop car careens onto the street in the background, its 
tsiren wailing.

tThe PASSENGER COP is leaning far out his window, one hand 
tgripping the light-and-siren rack, the other pointing a gun 
tat Hi, shooting away.

tBullets whizz past.

tSuddenly, with a soft pthunk! the Huggies box pops forward, 
tout from under Hi's arm - hit by a bullet. Still running, Hi 
treaches forward, tries to catch it on the fly, bobbles it, 
ttips it - loses it. He overruns it a couple steps before he 
tcan bring himself up short.

tHe turns and reaches to pick up the box but - PING-PING - 
tbullets chew up the road near his hand.

tLeaving the Huggies, Hi takes off through a well-manicured 
tyard.

tThe police car is proceeding on down the street to catch him 
taround the corner, the driver still drawling over his 
tloudspeaker:

</b>ttThat's private property, son. Come 
ttback out to the street and reveal 
ttyourself to Officer Steensma and 
ttOfficer Scott - that's me.

<b>tYARD
</b>
tHi vaults a fence to land in the backyard.

tAs he straightens to his feet we hear a horrible snarling 
tand barking.

tA huge black Doberman is bounding across the lawn. It looks 
tlike it means to rip Hi's throat out.

tThe dog's slavering muzzle flies into frame and - stops, 
tbare inches from Hi's nose, and the dog falls back, having 
treached the end of his chain.

tHi resumes running.

tOn the dog, snarling and straining against the end of his 
tchain.

tDown along the chain toward the spike mooring it to the

tground.

tOther dogs can be heard barking now, the Doberman having 
tstarted a sympathetic wave.

tShe is looking in her rearview mirror.

<b>ttttED
</b>tt...Say, that looks like Bill Steensma.

<b>tLOW TRACKING SHOT
</b>
tThe camera is shooting forward at ground level, following 
tthe Doberman as it bounds along. The Doberman is dragging 
this chain and spike, which stretch into the foreground, 
tbumping and scraping along the road.

tFar ahead we can see Hi running, then turning down an 
tintersecting street.

tA second dog peels into the road to bound along with the 
tDoberman.

<b>tTRACKING BEHIND HI

tRunning up a dark street. There is an oncoming pickup. Hi

</b>ttSon, you got a panty on your head.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttJust drive fast...

tHe is displaying his gun as he starts to climb in.

<b>ttttHI
</b>tt...and don't stop till I tell ya.

tBefore Hi can get his door shut the Driver is obediently 
tpeeling out.

tHi is reacting to an oncoming car. He peels the stocking off 
tto look, and leans across the Driver's lap to bellow as Ed's 
tcar passes:

</b>tt...Honey!

tHi turns to look through the back window.

tThe pimply-faced Cashier from the 7-Eleven is standing in 
tthe middle of the road ahead, sighting down his .44 Magnum 
tfor another shot.

tWe are rushing in.

tStill screaming.

<b>tTHE CASHIER
</b>
tReady to fire and - THUMP - he is bowled over by the arriving 
tDoberman, still trailing chain and spike, and now accompanied 
tby three other dogs, all braying at the top of their lungs.

tStill screaming, the Driver puts his body into a hard right 
tturn to avoid the Cashier and hellhounds.

<b>tNEW STREET

tRoaring up the new street, they are now directly in the path 
tof the oncoming police car, its siren wailing, barreling 
tstraight at them.

tStill screaming, the Driver leans into another hard right.

tWind is whistling in through where the windshield used to 
tbe.

tTwo wheels hop curb as the car skids into the new street,

</b>ttHold on Nathan, we'll take a shortcut.

tShe gives the wheel a hard right turn.

tBut there is no cross street. The car hops the curb and roars 
tup someone's nicely tended front yard, heading for the gap 
tbetween this house and the one next door.

tWe are tracking behind Hi as he runs up to the house and 
tcrashes through the screen door.

tStill tracking behind him as he runs through the living room.

tA middle-aged couple sits on the couch watching TV. They 
tlook up as Hi rushes by.

tHi plunges down a staircase. As he does so we hear: ka-chick 
tka-chock ka-chick ka-chock.

tHe emerges into a rec room where he and we rush past two 
tkids playing ping-pong. He runs out the back door.

<b>tTRACKING WITH THE POLICEMAN
</b>
tAs he runs into the house.

tAs he runs through the living room we catch a glimpse of the 
tmiddle-aged couple gaping at him.

tOFFICER STEENSMA plunges down the stairs.

<b>tTRACKING ON HI
</b>
tOutdoors now, running, crossing the street behind the house 
tand entering the parking lot of a supermarket on the other 
tside.

<b>tBACK TO THE HOUSE
</b>
tAs a pack of dogs thunders in. The lead Doberman with chain 
tand spike has now picked up about a dozen neighborhood dogs.

tThe dogs thunder through the living room and down the stairs. 
tAs they hit the rec room the thunder of their feet turns 
tinto the clatter of nails on tile.

<b>tINT. SUPERMARKET
</b>
tAs Hi bursts in. Tracking on him as he runs down the broad 
tfront aisle, head whipping as he runs, looking up each 
tperpendicular lane, searching for something.

tHe turns up one of the last lanes, races along it and grabs 
ta carton of Huggies, still on the flat run.

tHe emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it, but 
tat the first perpendicular lane he hits, we see Officer 
tSteensma, gun leveled, at the other end. He fires.

tHi keeps running.

tThe Policeman is running along the front aisle, keeping pace 
twith Hi running along the back aisle. He squeezes off shots 
tat Hi as each lane gives him the opportunity.

tHi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back, losing the 
tPoliceman. He runs down the second lane he comes to toward 
tthe front of the store.

tThe pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane and thunders 
tup toward Hi, braying at the top of their doggy lungs. The 
tlead Doberman holds in his teeth a paper 7-Eleven cap.

tHi reverses again, and emerges into the back aisle.

tBANG! A pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder. 
tThe Policeman has been waiting at the end of the back aisle; 
the aims once again.

tHi plunges down the next lane but is brought up short as KA-
tBOOM! five jars of applesauce explode in front of him.

tHi looks.

tStanding in the raised platform-cubicle at the front of the 
tstore is the Store Manager, a fat man in a white short-sleeved 
tshirt with a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth.

tThe Manager cracks open his shotgun and inserts two more 
tcartridges - THOONK THOONK - in the smoking chamber.

tHi doubles back once again toward the back aisle.

tHe is still several paces from the end of the lane when the 
tPoliceman appears there, squaring to face him.

tThe Policeman is in front of him. The MANAGER is blowing out 
tgroceries on the shelves behind him.

<b>tCLOSE ON POLICEMAN
</b>
tAs he coolly levels his police special and takes aim at Hi .

<b>tPOLICEMAN'S POV
</b>
tStill on the dead run, Hi is flinging the carton of Huggies.

tThe carton rockets straight at the camera.

<b>tBACK TO POLICEMAN
</b>
tFutilely raising his gun to avoid-impact: The Huggies catch 
thim square on the chest. The force makes him stumble one 
tfatal step backwards - into the back aisle - where:

tCRASH - He is hit broadside and bowled over by a rocketing 
tshopping cart, propelled by an hysterically screaming SHOPPER.

<b>tTRACKING ON SHOPPER
</b>
tRacing on down the back aisle, bellowing.

<b>tHER FEET
</b>
tTracking from in front. Beyond her we can see the pack of 
tfuriously barking dogs, nipping at her heels. They boil over 
tthe prostrate Officer Steensma, and this is the last we see 
tof him in this movie.

tof the lot.

</b>ttThank you honey, you really didn't

ttoward the camera.

</b>ttYou son-of-a-bitch! You're actin' 
ttlike a mad dog!

tRubbing his jaw:

</b>ttTurn left, honey.

tStill at top speed, she leans into a hard left, tires 
tsquealing.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttWhat if me'n the baby'd been picked

</b>ttI know, but honey -

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttSee I come from a long line of 
ttfrontiersmen and - here it is, turn 
tthere dear - frontiersmen and outdoor

tHi's eyes are fixed on something in the road ahead.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttI'm not gonna live this way, Hi. It 
ttjust ain't family life!

tHi's attention is still on the road. He is opening his door, 
teven though the car is still racing along. He absently 
tconcedes:

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttWell... It ain't Ozzie and Harriet.

<b>tLOW ANGLE THE STREET
</b>
tIn the extreme foreground sits the first carton of Huggies 
tthat Hi dropped in the middle of the road. The car is 
tapproaching.

tAs the car passes the carton, Hi's hand reaches from the 
tpassenger door and snags it.

tAs Ed bursts in the front door, holding Nathan Jr.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttYou two are leaving.

tThey look up, dumbstruck and mortified, from the sofa where

</b>ttTomorrow morning. Now I got nothing 
ttagainst you personally...

tGale and Evelle look appealingly toward Hi, who shifts 
tuncomfortably behind Ed.

<b>ttttED
</b>tt...but you're wanted by the 
ttauthorities and you're a bad influence 
ttin this household, in my opinion.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttWell ma'am... we sure didn't mean to 
ttinfluence anyone.

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttAnd if we did, we apologize.

tEd is unmoved.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttI'm goin' in to town tomorrow to see 
ttabout some shots for the baby. When 
ttI come back you better be gone or 
ttI'll kick you out myself.

tShe storms into the bedroom and slams the door.

tThere is an awkward silence as Gale studies his thumb and 
tEvelle stares at the ceiling. Finally Evelle turns to Hi.

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>tt...What's he need, his dip-tet?

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttI'm awful sorry boys, but when Ed 
ttgets mad, you know, when she gets an

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttWell there ain't a thing to apologize 
ttfor, H.I...

tHe looks at Evelle.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tt...It seems pretty clear what the

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttYeah, I guess the Missus wants us to 
ttclear out.

</b>ttNow H.I., you'll pardon me for sayin'

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttIt's like Doc Schwartz says: You

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttWell now that ain't really any of

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttJust lookahere...

tHe is handing Hi a folded-up picture.

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttPicture of El Dorado, Hi.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttThough the locals call it the Farmers 
ttand Mechanics Bank of LaGrange. Looks 
ttlike a hayseed bank and, tell you 
ttthe truth, it is a hayseed bank. 
ttExcept the last Friday of every 
ttfinancial quarter there's more cash 
ttin that bank than flies at a barbecue.

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttAnd guess what day it is tomorrow?

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttYa see, H.I., it's when the hayseeds 
ttcome in to cash their farm subsidy 
ttchecks.

</b>ttA-One information.

</b>ttOrdinarily we don't associate with

</b>tt...he was tryin' to make brownie 
ttpoints with some of the boys.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttBoys, I can't -

<b>ttttEVIELLE
</b>ttWe need someone handy with a scatter-

ttget the cash.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttY'understand, H.I., if this works 
ttout it's just the beginning of a

</b>ttEither way we're fixed for life.

tHi is still shaking his head.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttBoys, it's a kind offer, but you're 
ttsuggesting I just up'n leave Ed. Now 
ttthat'd be pretty damn cowardly, 
ttwouldn't it.

</b>ttWould it?  Think about it, H.I. Seems 
ttto me, stayin' here, y'ain't doin' 
tther any good. And y'ain't bein' true 
ttto your own nature.

tThe camera has floated in to a close shot of Hi, staring 
tglumly at GALE.

<b>tTRACKING ON MOTORCYCLE NIGHT
</b>
tFollowing it, very close, we see only its rear wheel and 
tfender and twin exhaust pipes, one on either side. Flame is 
tboiling in each exhaust pipe as the hog roars.

<b>tHIGHER TRACKING SHOT
</b>
tFrom behind the Biker's head as he rides through the night. 
tWith the sharp whipcrack effect he suddenly looks left, 
tsearching. With a second whipcrack effect he suddenly looks 
tright, still searching.

tHe banks into a turn.

<b>tEXT. TRAILER

tCreeping in. Late at night. We are tracking in toward the 
tone window that is illuminated, with a feeble yellow light.

tIn voice-over, Hi is composing a letter.

ttand Nathan slumber, my heart is filled 
ttwith anguish.

tCreeping in on Hi 's hunched back, as he sits over the kitchen

ttI have decided I must do. By the 
tttime you read this, I will be gone.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

tCreeping in on GALE and EVELLE, sprawled on the sofa and 
teasy chair respectively, sawing boards.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...I will never be the man that you 
ttwant me to be, the husband and father 
ttthat you and Nathan deserve...

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
</b>
<b>tBACK TO HI
</b>
tStill creeping in.

ttjust that my genes got screwed up - 
ttI don't know...

</b>
tCreeping in on the pimply-faced Cashier, sitting asleep behind 
tthe counter, a dirty magazine lying face-down, open on his 
tchest.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttBut the events of the last day have 
ttshowed, amply, that I don't have the 
ttstrength of character to raise up a

tWe are slowly panning over to the newspaper rack, revealing 
ttomorrow's headline: "WHERE IS NATHAN JR.?"

</b>tt...in the manner befitting a 
ttresponsible adult, and not like the 
ttwild man from Borneo.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
</b>
<b>tARIZONA HOME
</b>
tCreeping in on Nathan Jr. in the living room, asleep in his 
tottoman armchair, lit only by the snow from the TV set he is 
tfacing, a half-full glass of milk on the coffee table next 
tto him.

tHis robe is disheveled; his eyeglasses have slid down his 
tnose.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...I say all this to my shame.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
</b>
<b>tTRAILER BEDROOM
</b>
tCreeping in on Ed and Nathan Jr., asleep together in the 
tdouble bed. Ed's arm is draped protectively over the sleeping 
tinfant.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...I will love you always, truly and 
ttdeeply. But I fear that if I stay I 
ttwould only bring bad trouble...

tWe start to hear the rumble of the motorcycle mix up again.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>tt...on the heads of you and Nathan 
ttJr.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
</b>
<b>tBLACKNESS
</b>
tNight sky. The motorcycle tire enters frame as the bike comes 
tto a halt. The Biker plants a jackbooted foot in the 
tforeground.

tThe engine rumbles.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttI feel the thunder gathering even 
ttnow; if I leave, hopefully, it will 
ttleave with me.

tWe are craning up over the Biker's back to reveal what he is 
tlooking at: We are on a bluff overlooking the trailer park. 
tIn the window of one trailer below, a yellow light glows.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttI cannot tarry...

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
</b>
<b>tBACK TO HI
</b>
tStill creeping in.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b>ttBetter I should go, send you money, 
ttand let you curse my name. Your 
ttloving... Herbert.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT
</b>
<b>tFIRE
</b>
tRoaring at the cut. Through it we can see the Biker sitting 
ton the ground, legs stretched out in front of him, back 
tresting against his parked motorcycle, arms folded across 
this chest.

tPerfectly motionless, he stares at the campfire.

tWe are floating in toward him.

tAs we come closer, eventually drawing in to a close shot of 
this face, we gradually realize something peculiar about his 
teyes: He seems to have none. Although his eyes are 
tunblinkingly open we do not see eyeballs, but only fire - 
teither a reflection of the campfire or something roaring - 
tburning-inside.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT DOOR MAT
</b>
tIt reads: "Come On In! To Unpainted Arizona."

tThe smoking butt of a cheroot is dropped onto the mat. A 
tjackbooted foot grinds it out.

</b>
tLeading into the showroom. The Biker's mail-and-chained fist 
tpushes the door open.

<b>tLOW WIDE TRACKING SHOT
</b>
tBehind the jackboots as they stroll through a showroom of 
tunpainted furniture and bathroom fixtures.

<b>tTRACKING ON THE MAILED HAND
</b>
tSwinging as he walks, the Biker's hand produces a fresh 
tcheroot from no apparent source-either sleight-of-hand or 
tmagic.

<b>tTHE OTHER HAND
</b>
tSimilarly producing a long wooden match.

<b>tDISCOLORED TEETH
</b>
tBiting down on the cigar.

</b>
tDragging the kitchen match along the unfinished wood surface 
tof an expensive bureau, leaving an ugly black scar.

tThe match erupts into roaring flame.

tCrackling as it is lit.

<b>tDOOR
</b>
tReading "Executive Offices." The mailed fist pushes it open.

<b>tPEBBLED GLASS DOOR
</b>
tFrom the inside of the office. The name on the pebbled glass 
tis a backwards Nathan Arizona.

tThere is the shadow of a man approaching the door, and muffled 
tvoices.

<b>ttttSECRETARY'S VOICE
</b>ttI'm sorry, Mr. Arizona, he just barged 
ttin...

tThe door swings open and Nathan stands looking in, his middle-
taged secretary hanging at his elbow.

<b>ttttSECRETARY'S VOICE
</b>tt...Should I call Dewayne?

tNathan is staring toward his desk.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttHell no, why wake the security guard. 
ttI'll take care a this.

tThe secretary leaves.

<b>tNATHAN'S POV
</b>
tThe Biker sits with his back to us, jackboots propped lazily 
ton the desk.

tHis head bobs and ducks, as if he is following some movement 
tin the air in front of him.

<b>tBACK TO NATHAN
</b>
tEyes on the Biker he slams the door shut behind him, looking 
tfor some reaction.

<b>tBIKER
</b>
tNo reaction. His head continues to bob and duck.

<b>tBACK TO NATHAN
</b>
tCircling the Biker as he crosses to sit behind his desk.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tArcing around to reveal the Biker's face. He still does not 
treact to Nathan, not even bothering to give him a glance.

tHis eyes continue to follow some phantom movement.

tWhen the Biker speaks it is still without looking at Nathan, 
tand with a surprisingly soft voice and mild, unhurried manner:

<b>ttttBIKER
</b>ttYou got flies.

tHe finally looks at Nathan, and smiles faintly.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttI doubt it. This place's climate-
ttcontrolled, all the windows are 
ttsealed. Who the hell are you?

<b>ttttBIKER
</b>ttName of Leonard Smalls. My friends 
ttcall me Lenny...

tHe takes a drag on his cigar.

<b>ttttBIKER
</b>tt...Only I ain't got no friends.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttStop, you'll make me bust out crying. 
ttListen Leonard, you want some

tton the sales floor.

tSMALLS is pleasantly shaking his head.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttWhat do you know about it?

<b>ttttSMALLS
</b>ttWal, that's my business. I'm a tracker-
ttpart Hopi Indian, some say part hound 
ttdog. When some dink skips bail,

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttMister, I got the cops, the state 
tttroopers and the Federal-B-I already 
ttlookin' for my boy. Now if you got 
ttinformation I strongly advise-

<b>ttttSMALLS
</b>ttCop won't find your boy. Cop couldn't 
ttfind his own butt if it had a bell 
tton it. Wanna find an outlaw, call an 
ttoutlaw. Wanna find a Dunkin Donuts, 
ttcall a cop.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttSmalls, first off, take your damn 
ttfeet off m'furniture. Second off, 
ttit's widely known I posted a twenty

ttwhat do we got to talk about?

<b>ttttSMALLS
</b>ttPrice. Fair price. And that ain't

tNathan is looking at him stonily.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttWhat're you after?

<b>ttttSMALLS
</b>ttGive you an idea, when I was a lad I 
ttm'self fetched twenty-five thousand 
tton the black market. And them's 1954 
ttdollars. I'm sayin, fair price. For 
ttfifty grand I'll track him, find him-

tQuick as a flash the heretofore languid Smalls bolts forward, 
this fist stopped an inch short of Nathan's nose.

<b>tEXTREME CLOSE SHOT SMALLS' FINGERS
</b>
tHis index finger and thumb are pinched together-holding the 
tleg of a struggling fly that he has just plucked from the 
tair.

<b>ttttSMALLS
</b>tt...and the people that took him...

tHe flicks the fly away.

<b>ttttSMALLS

tNathan stares grimly at Smalls.

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttAnd if I don't pay?

<b>ttttSMALLS
</b>ttOh I'll get your boy regardless. 
ttCause if you don't pay, the market

<b>ttttNATHAN
</b>ttYou wanna know what I think? I think

tNathan swivels to punch numbers on a telephone.

</b>ttI think I'm on the phone to the cops

tHe swivels back, looking up, and his speech stops short.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe office is empty. A whipcrack effect builds to the cut 
tand:

<b>tCLOSE ON HI
</b>
tHis eyes snap open as the whipcrack echoes away.

tHe has been slumped over the kitchen table, asleep.

<b>ttttGALE (O.S.)
</b>ttUp and attem, H.I. Today is the first

tHi looks up.

tGale and Evelle are smiling down at him.

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttCome on, the missus'll be back from 
tttown soon.

tHi takes the envelope that he was slumped over, to Ed written 
ton its face. As he sticks it to the refrigerator door with a 
tbroccoli magnet:

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttWhere's the baby?

<b>ttttEVELLE
</b>ttBedroom, in his crib.

<b>ttttGALE

tThere is a harsh knock at the door. All three tense.

tHi is staring. The knock comes again.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttNo. You two stay outta sight.

tHe goes to the door, pulls back its shade and peeks out. 
tUnder his breath:

tHe opens the door.

<b>tEXT. TRAILER

tIt is Glen. He backs nervously down to the foot of the stoop 
tas Hi stands in the half open doorway. Glen comes to rest a

ttaped together. Cotton wadding is stuffed up his nose, which 
tis darkly discolored. He holds a rolled up newspaper.

ttI'll just keep my distance.

</b>ttWell that ain't why I'm here neither. 
ttNo sir. You're in a whole shitload

</b>ttWhy don't you just calm down, Glen.

<b>ttttGLEN
</b>ttWhy don't you make me?! Know that

tHi is suddenly nervous and urgent:

</b>ttWanna keep your voice down, Glen?

<b>ttttGLEN
</b>ttI'll pitch my voice wherever I please! 
ttHis name ain't Hi Jr.! His name ain't

ttYes sir, it's Nathan Jr.!

tHi takes one step down holding out a calming hand.

tGlen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by 
tresting a hand on the door of his station wagon.

<b>ttttGLEN
</b>tt...Stay away from me, McDunnough!

tHi stops short. Glen smiles.

<b>ttttGLEN
</b>tt...Sure, you're an awful big man

</b>ttThat's right! And now you're at my

tHe spits on the dirt in front of him.

<b>ttttGLEN
</b>tt...I'm your worst nightmare!  I wanted 
ttto just turn you in for the re-ward. 
ttBut Dot, she wants something to

tHi's face is set in rigid dismay.

tGlen is getting into his car.

<b>ttttGLEN
</b>tt...Dot'll be by tomorrow to pick him

tHe slams the door.

<b>ttttGLEN
</b>tt...It's either that or jail. Oh and

tAnd the car squeals off.

tHi looks back at the trailer.

tA slat in the window blind drops back into place.

</b>
tHe opens the door.

</b>
tEvelle is already emerging from the bedroom with the baby in 
this arms.

tHi moves toward Evelle. His teeth are set; he means business.

<b>ttttHI
</b>ttWhat's goin' on here.

tGale steps in front of Hi.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttYou know what's goin' on, H.I. It's 
ttjust business. Now this can go either 
tthard or easy-

tHi gives Gale a hard push to get past him. Gale staggers 
tback but recovers and grabs Hi in a bear hug.

tHi flips Gale. Gale lands on a coffee table which flips up 
tand crashes back down.

tEvelle is dancing back out of Hi's reach. As Hi lunges for 
thim the prostrate Gale grabs his legs.

tHi goes down hard.

tGale leaps to his feet and - CRASH - bangs his head up against 
tan overhanging lamp. Both of his hands fly up to massage the 
ttop of his head.

tTHOOMP - Hi's fist flies into frame to connect with Gale's 
tunguarded stomach. Gale doubles over, clutching at his gut.

tHi interlaces his fingers to make a club of his two hands.

tWith Gale's bowed head a target in front of him, Hi swings 
this hands up over his head.

tHi's knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the 
ttoo - low ceiling. Skin is flayed, plaster crumbles.

tHi grabs at his knuckles in pain. Gale lunges with a mid-
tbody tackle that sends Hi crashing into the wall.

tGale, still on top of him, reaches back to throw a punch.

tThe reach-back sends his elbow crashing through a window but 
tdoesn't stop the punch.

tIt connects with Hi's jaw.

tGale throws another quick punch, all his weight behind it. 
tHi's head bobs sideways just in time and Gale's fist goes 
tthrough the wall. It is momentarily stuck there.

tHi uses the opportunity to grab Gale's one free arm with 
tboth of his. He is twisting it to make Gale, roaring with 
tpain, twist around and present his back to him.

tHi climbs aboard, grabbing Gale's face.

tGale, still roaring, is pulling his fist out of the hole. He 
tgrabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls; it tears out of 
tthe wall and snaps free, giving him a length of about two 
tfeet.

tGale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too-
tsmall space. Hi is hanging on for dear life, his own feet 
tflailing this way and that, knocking over lamps and wall 
tfixtures as Gale bends and twirls about, trying to shake him 
tloose. Gale crashes and bounces off the walls, roaring in 
tpain and fury.

tClose shots of Gale's face show his features impossibly and 
tgrotesquely contorted by Hi's hand, squeezing, gripping and 
tclutching at it.

tEvelle is dancing around with the baby, dodging crashing 
tfurniture and flailing body parts.

<b>tEXT. WIDE SHOT THE TRAILER

tbirds and the laughter of children playing in the 
tneighborhood.

tIt is a sunny day.

<b>tBACK TO INT. TRAILER
</b>
tGale still roars. With a last mighty effort, he finally swings 
tHi off his body.

tHi crashes against a wall and through it to land in the:

<b>tBATHROOM
</b>
tAmid a shower of plaster dust and lath. Hi has landed, 
tgroggily, against the toilet.

tEvelle enters now with his hands free, apparently having set 
tthe baby down somewhere.

tHe yanks the cord off the bathroom blinds.

<b>tLIVING ROOM
</b>
tHi is seated in a straight-back chair, still violently 
tstruggling but Gale's arms are wrapped around him from behind.

tEvelle is just finishing tying off his wrists behind the 
tchair.

tNo one talks; there is nothing left to say.

tFinished, Gale goes to the door and Evelle goes to the 
tbedroom. He emerges with the baby and precedes Gale out the 
tdoor, Gale slamming it behind him.

tHi starts bucking and struggling, weeping tears of rage and 
tfrustration. He succeeds only in tipping forward, face down 
tinto the carpet, the strapped-on chair pressing down on top 
tof him.

tHis profile is pressed into the carpet.

tOffscreen we hear the door of the trailer opening.

tAt carpet level. Gale's shoes enter his field of vision. 
tThey stride over to a mess of debris in the corner of the 
tliving room.

tAs Gale paws through the wreckage to expose the copy of Dr. 
tSpock's Baby and Child Care. He grabs the book.

tThe feet walk away and leave his field of vision.

tAs we hear the door slam shut with horrible finality.

tHi's mouth stretches wide. He ROARS with grief and 
tfrustration.

tMoving down the road toward an oncoming car. As the oncoming 
tcar gets closer we can see Gale and Evelle in its front seat.

tAs the car passes we pan with it, to reveal that we have 
tbeen shooting from the inside of another car, and we hold on 
tthe profile of its driver: Ed. She has just watched the other 
tcar shoot past.

tBeyond her in the middle background Hi is rummaging in the 
tdebris. He stands up, cropped from the chest down and starts 
tloading bullets into the chamber of Ed's .38 police special.

<b>ttttHI

tHe is walking back into frame holding another handgun now in

tHe snaps a clip into the automatic.

ttNow they ain't gonna hurt him, they're 
ttjust in it for the score...

tHi is leaving frame again, continuing to talk as we hear him 
trummaging offscreen.

<b>ttttHI
</b>tt...But I ain't like that no more, 
ttI'm a changed man. You were right 
ttand I was wrong. We got a family

tHi enters frame with the two handguns stuck in his belt, 
tholding his pump-action shotgun.

tHe primes the shotgun: WHOOSH-CLACK.

tA huge rumbling rippling red ball that fills the frame.

tAs we hear his footfalls on concrete steps, Smalls rises 
tinto frame, apparently climbing a stoop. The sun behind him 
tthrows him into silhouette; the extreme telephoto flattens 
thim against the sun. Heat waves ripple between us and him, 
tmaking his figure slightly waver.

tThe rumble builds, louder and louder, until it is snapped 
toff by a-

<b>tINT. TRAILER
</b>
tCLICK. The front door handle clicks open and Smalls stands 
tin the doorway. The abandoned trailer is perfectly quiet.

tThe room is a complete shambles from the fight. Sunlight 
tfilters in between the slats of the venetian blinds. Smoke 
tfrom Lenny Smalls' cheroot ripples up through the light.

tAfter only a momentary pause at the door to take in the scene, 
tSmalls goes directly to a specific spot in the debris and 
tnudges some of it aside with his toe, exposing a piece of 
tpaper.

tHe bends down to pick it up but suddenly freezes, with a 
tsoft grunt of surprise.

</b>
tEvelle and the Cashier, a late-middle-aged man (perhaps the 
tproprietor of this small mom-and-pop store) face each other 
tacross the check-out counter. Evelle has various baby 
tpurchases - the diapers, baby food, etc. - piled on the

tThrough the open door beyond them we can see a strip of the

</b>ttWell no, they got those tape-ettes

tGale is trotting by in the opposite direction: "Weeeeee!"

tEvelle is screaming at the top of his lungs as the car rocks 
tto a stop. He peers through the windshield, still screaming, 
tbut nothing has shot off the roof of the car.

tHe cranes his neck to look up the slant of the windshield 
ttoward the roof. This of course gives him no view; still 
tscreaming, he thrusts his body out his open window to look 
tup at the roof. His scream is muted as his head disappears 
tfrom view, then comes back full force as he ducks back in, 
tfrantically shaking his head.

tWith this Gale's last hope disappears and he starts bellowing 
talso.

tin the back seat.

tBellowing:

</b>ttGoddamnit! Ya never leave a man

tKA-POP! With a loud flat crack something detonates in the

tbright blue paint.

tGale and Evelle, both covered in blue, are screaming in rage, 
tfear and incomprehension. Blue dollar bills snap and flutter 
taround the inside of the car.

tThe car is swerving wildly as Gale drives blind, the inside 
tof the windshield covered with blue paint. He reaches forward 
tto wipe clear a patch of windshield.

tshotgun.

tAs we boom up to show the empty street beyond the baby, we 
thear the crack of return fire and furiously squealing brakes. 
tThe screech culminates in a loud explosion that snaps off 
tthe siren wail. The police car is apparently history.

tFrom beyond the crest of the road ahead a ball of flame has 
tleapt up with the explosion. As the explosion echoes and 
tfades we hear the deep rumble of an approaching engine.

tLenny Smalls' motorcycle appears over the rise. Framed against 
tfire and smoke, he is coming directly toward us, and the 
tbaby.

</b>ttThe hell is goin' on?

tHe advances cautiously into the nursery, gesturing with his 
tgun.

tHi and Ed back away from the crib.

tNathan peers in and studies the baby for a moment.

tHe lays the gun down, tenderly picks up the baby and holds 
thim to his chest. A tear forms at the corner of his eye.
