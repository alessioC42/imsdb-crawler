<b>ACT ONE
</b><b>-------
</b><b>ttttttttFADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. -- A FARMHOUSE OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT
</b>
On the farmhouse roof a CHICKEN-SHAPED WEATHERVANE stands silhouetted
against a FULL, BLOOD-RED MOON.  The wind HOWLS and the vane swivels with
an EERIE SQUEAK.  Then a weird ANIMAL CRY is heard--a cross between a
chicken CROWING and a wolf HOWLING.

<b>ttttWERECHICKEN  (VO)
</b><b>ttt(A CROWING HOWL)
</b>
<b>ttttttCAMERA PANS DOWN TO:
</b>
<b>CHICKEN PEN
</b>
A fenced-in dirt area with numerous CHICKENS milling around, CLUCKING as
they peck at the ground.

<b>ttttWERECHICKEN (VO)
</b>ttt(ANOTHER HOWL, nearer now)
ttThe chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound.

<b>WERECHICKEN'S POV -- MOVING
</b>
A RED-tinted, shaky, MOVING CAMERA TRUCK-IN on the chickens.  (These shots
are in the style of the POV SHOTS in WOLFEN.)  Magnified GURGLING and
HEAVY BREATHING of Werechicken is heard.

<b>ttttWERECHICKEN (VO)
</b><b>ttt(GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING)
</b>
The terrified chickens stare INTO CAMERA as the Werechicken moves closer,
his shadow falling over them.  They flap into their coop, SQUAWKING
wildly.

<b>INT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
MAUDE and ZEKE sit on the sagging couch watching a werewolf movie on TV
while munching popcorn from a huge bowl.  They're distracted by CHICKENS
<b>SQUAWKING.
</b>
<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttSump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttJes' set easy, Zeke.
ttt(she rises; heads for door)
ttI'll take a look-see.

Zeke continues staring at TV.

<b>EXT.  FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT -- WERECHICKEN'S POV
</b>
Through the Werechicken's red eyes, we see a distant image of Maude with a
flashlight, approaching the fenced-in chicken pen and opening the gate.
CAMERA STARTS MOVING IN toward Maude as she enters, leaving gate open.

<b>ttttWERECHICKEN (VO)
</b><b>ttt(GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING)
</b>
<b>ANGLE WITHIN CHICKEN PEN
</b>
The dirt compound is empty now as Maude crosses toward wooden chicken
coop.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttt(as she goes)
ttHere, chick-chick-chick-chick.

<b>INT.  CHICKEN COOP -- OTS MAUDE
</b>
AS Maude ENTERS from OUT OF CAMERA, her flashlight beam illuminates the
chickens cowering on their roosts in a corner.  They CLUCK nervously.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b>ttWhat's got you girls so durned upset?
ttThere a coyote sneakin' 'round?

Suddenly the Werechicken's shadow moves up Maude's back, then the wall.

<b>ttttWERECHICKEN (VO)
</b>ttt(Low, gutteral CLU-UCK)

Maude looks over her shoulder AT CAMERA, reacts.

<b>ttttMAUDE
</b><b>ttt(GASP!)
</b>
<b>MAUDE'S POV -- THE WERECHICKEN
</b>
Red-eyed, grotesque, three times the size of an ordinary rooster as it
stands framed in the moonlit doorway.  It opens its fanged beak in a
horrifying SHRIEK as it springs AT CAMERA, wings flapping.

<b>ttttWERECHICKEN
</b>ttt(Frightening SHRIEK)

<b>INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - CLOSE ON TV
</b>
Old black-and-white movie.  MELODRAMATIC MUSIC as a man turns into a
werewolf, his HOWL a continuation of the previous Werechicken SHRIEK.

<b>ttttTV WEREWOLF
</b>ttt(eerie HOWL)

<b>WIDER ANGLE - ZEKE
</b>
continues watching TV and eating popcorn.  Maude walks stiffly into room
behind him, eyes staring blankly.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttt(without looking up)
ttEverythin' okay out there, Maude?

<b>WAIST SHOT -- MAUDE
</b>
She stares with glassy, red eyes and CLUCKS quietly.

<b>ttttMAUDE-CHICKEN
</b><b>ttt(CLUCKS)
</b>
<b>ttttZEKE (VO)
</b>ttWhat say?

PAN DOWN below Maude's waist to reveal that she's turning into a chicken
from the feet up.  First her shoes RIP apart as large, yellow chicken feet
sprout.  Then her dress SWELLS and SPLITS, revealing a large, feathered
body underneath. The only piece of clothing left on her is her apron.  One
foot scratches the floor.

<b>ttttMAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)
</b>ttt(more CLUCKS)

<b>WIDER ANGLE -- FULLSHOT OF MAUDE-CHICKEN
</b>
Now completely transformed and six feet tall, she leaps up to perch on
back of couch, THRUSTING her chicken head repeatedly into the popcorn bowl
in Zeke's lap, pecking the bowl clean.  Zeke's jaw hangs open, speechless,
as he stares at the fanged, drooling, six-foot Werechicken.  The
Werechicken looks up from the empty bowl, right in Zeke's terrified eyes.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b><b>ttt(SCREAMS)
</b>
He scrambles backwards off the couch.

<b>EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT - WERECHICKEN'S POV
</b>
SCENE RED-tinted.   We hear loud SQUAWKING from within house as chicken
feathers fly out the open windows.

<b>ttttZEKE (VO)
</b><b>ttt(YELLING)
</b>ttGet away!' Scat!  Shoo!

<b>ttttMAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)
</b>ttt(loud SQUAWKING)

<b>CLOSE ANGLE -- WERECHICKEN
</b>
Watching from slight hilltop.  Its beak seems to bend into an insidious
grin.

<b>ttttZEKE (VO)
</b>ttt(from distance)
ttHelp!... He-elp!

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  ESTABLISHING -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - NIGHT
</b>
As CAMERA MOVES IN, we hear:

<b>ttttPETER (VO)
</b>ttEgon, could you hold off on the weather
ttballoon bit for a minute?

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE THRU TO:
</b>
<b>INT. -- LABORATORY -- ON PETER AND RAY
</b>
They stand holding big plastic bags of trash, obviously annoyed at the
O.S. Egon.  Ray's armful of trash is piled so high that he can't see over
it.  SLIMER hovers behind, sticking his nose in one of the bags like a
dog.  He finally dives right into it.

<b>ttttPETER (CONT)
</b>ttIt's Your night to take out the trash.

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttAnd Winston's in the kitchen doing your
ttdishes.

<b>ANGLE ON EGON
</b>
He's busy testing his WEATHER BALLOON--a large, pink bubble half the size
of the room.  He moves a lever on its remote control unit and the balloon
rises.

<b>ttttEGON
</b>ttt(preoccupied; through above)
ttBe with you in ...
ttt(checks watch)
tt...one minute, fifty-three seconds.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Peter and Ray exchange pained glances.  Peter awkwardly attempts to pick
up another trash bag while Ray stumbles around, his vision blocked.  PAN
WITH THEM as they move toward door when Egon's weather balloon suddenly
lowers INTO FRAME.  They bounce into and off of it, which sends the trash
bags flying.

<b>ttttPETER AND RAY
</b>ttt(AD-LIB REACTIONS as they
tttbounce off balloon)

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Peter stumbles backwards and lands butt-first right on one of the bags.
Slimer SQUEALS from within it.

<b>ttttSLIMER (VO)
</b>ttt(big muffled SQUEAL)

Then he comes shooting out the back of the bag, the lower half of his body
flat as a Frisbee.

<b>SLIMER
</b>
shakes himself off like a dog, spraying slime all over Peter.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(pissed; sarcastic)
ttThanks, Slimer.  I really needed that!

<b>ttttSLIMER
</b>ttSorreee!

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Ray helps Peter up as the telephone RINGS and RINGS.

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttt(irritated)
ttEgon!  The phone!

<b>ON EGON
</b>
The RINGING phone is right beside him on the workbench.

<b>ttttEGON
</b>ttt(preoccupied with remote
tttcontrols)
ttIn a minute, Ray.

<b>ANGLE ON WINSTON
</b>
He ENTERS with sleeves rolled up, wiping a plate with a dish towel and
wearing an apron.

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b>ttt(sarcastic)
ttNevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to
ttstrain yourself.
ttt(picks up phone)
ttGhostbusters Central.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER PHONE
</b>ttt(excited CHATTER)

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b>ttCalm down... Where are you?...
ttt(a BEAT as he listens)
ttWe'll be right there.

He hangs up.

<b>WIDER ANGLE
</b>
Peter and Ray again have their arms full of trash bags.  Even Slimer is
dragging one.

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b>ttReady for this one?  Some farmer says his
ttwife was eaten by a giant chicken.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttHey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds
ttbetter than doing Egon's chores.
ttt(he drops trash bags)
ttLet's roll!

Ray and Slimer also abandon their trash bags and EXIT with Peter and
Winston.

<b>REAR VIEW ON EGON
</b>
still oblivious as he works in the suddenly empty room.

<b>ttttEGON
</b>ttI think I've finally perfected it.  Watch
ttthis, guys.
ttt(a BEAT, he looks around
tttover shoulder)
ttGuys?

<b>ttttttttWIPE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. -- COUNTRY ROAD - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
</b>
ECTO-1 roars INTO CAMERA, siren and lights going.

<b>INT. -- ECTO 1 -- MOVING
</b>
The Ghostbusters, minus Egon, are wearing their gear.  Slimer hovers in
back seat.

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttIt sure feels strange not having Egon with
ttus.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(sarcastic)
ttWhy?  Lately even when he's with us, he's
ttnot with us.

<b>ON WINSTON
</b>
Driving.

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b>ttBut wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells
ttthat weather balloon idea of his?  He'll be
tta rich man!

<b>ON PETER
</b>
Arms folded, grumpily.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttGood.  Then he can hire a maid to do his
ttshare of the chores.

<b>EXT. -- ECTO 1 -- NIGHT
</b>
As it speeds OUT OF CAMERA toward distant farmhouse, PAN OVER TO the
apron-wearing Maude-Chicken silhouetted in the moonlight, nesting in a
haystack.  MOVE IN TO --

<b>CLOSER ANGLE ON MAUDE-CHICKEN
</b>
Her body starts to shake, she ruffles her wings.

<b>ttttMAUDE-CHICKEN
</b>ttt(Egg-laying CLUCKS)

Then she suddenly sits up and leaps off the haystack, revealing an
enormous egg beneath her.  Maude SQUAWKS and CLUCKS and struts off into a
cornfield, pecking away at ears of corn.

<b>ttttMAUDE-CHICKEN
</b>ttt(SQUAWKS and CLUCKS)

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
Ray, Winston and Slimer listen seriously as Zeke speaks, but Peter's
obviously not buying it.

<b>ttttZEKE
</b>ttHad big blood-red eyes, it did.  Biggest
ttdang chicken I ever seen.  Mebbe six feet
tttall.

Peter rolls his eyes.

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b>ttShouldn't be hard to find.

<b>RAY
</b>
is jotting info on notepad.

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttDid it have any distinguishing marks?

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttRay!  It's six feet tall!

Peter grabs Ray's arm, starts ushering him to front door.

<b>ttttPETER (CONT)
</b>ttt(over shoulder as he goes)
ttThank you, Sir.  We'll put out a missing
ttchicken report right away.

<b>EXT.  FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
As the three Ghostbusters and Slimer cross toward Ecto-1 parked in front.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(as they go)
ttThis one's easy, guys.  Old Zeke's been
ttwatchin' too many horror movies and eating
tttoo much greasy popcorn.

<b>CLOSER ANGLE -- MOVING
</b>
<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttNo, Peter, I think we're dealing with a
ttbonafide werechicken here.

<b>CLOSER ANGLE
</b>
Peter and Winston stop, look at Ray in disbelief.

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b>ttA werechicken?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttGet serious, Ray.

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttThen explain those!

Ray points at ground.  Peter, Winston and Slimer look down.

<b>THEIR POV
</b>
Peter is standing with both feet in two enormous chicken footprints.

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. -- OPEN FIELD -- NIGHT
</b>
The three Ghostbusters follow Maude's "chicken" tracks with powerful
flashlights across a field spotted with haystacks.  Slimer moves ahead,
nose to ground like a bloodhound.

<b>ttttSLIMER
</b>ttt(SNIFFS as he goes)

<b>ANGLE ON SLIMER
</b>
He floats along above the flashlight-illuminated tracks which lead him
right into the haystack.  We hear a BONK from within, then:

<b>ttttSLIMER (VO)
</b>ttOw!

Slimer backs OUT INTO SHOT rubbing his head.  He looks up and his eyes pop
wide.

<b>ttttSLIMER
</b>ttt(amazed GASP!)

<b>LOW ANGLE ON GIANT EGG
</b>
The Ghostbusters ENTER SHOT and play their flashlights across the huge egg
sitting atop the haystack.

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttt(excited)
ttWhat'd I tell you, Peter?  A werechicken
ttegg!  Gimme a hand, Winston!

<b>WIDER ANGLE
</b>
As Ray and Winston ease the egg down off the haystack.  Peter holds his
PKE meter up to it.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttLook, if this is a werechicken egg,

<b>CLOSER ANGLE -- METER
</b>
Nothing registers on the meter.

<b>ttttPETER (CONT)
</b>tt...how come there's no PKE reading?

<b>THREESHOT
</b>
Ray and Winston still hold giant egg.

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttt(looking at meter in
tttPeter's hand)
ttI dunno... that is strange.

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b>ttLet's get it back to Headquarters and run
ttsome tests.  Then maybe we'll have some
ttanswers.

<b>ON RAY
</b>
<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttOh no, I'm not leavin'.  The werechicken
ttthat laid this has gotta be around here

<b>ON PETER AND SLIMER
</b>
<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(throws up his hands with
tttheavy SIGH)
ttI'll take it.  C'mon, Slimer.

They take egg from Ray and Winston and start back toward Ecto-l.

<b>ttttPETER  (CONT)
</b>ttt(shaking his head; as he
tttgoes)
ttWerechickens.

<b>WERECHICKEN'S POV
</b>
Through its RED EYES we see, from a distance, Peter and Slimer carrying
the egg, Ray and Winston moving off in other direction.

Egon still busy with his balloon as Peter and Slimer carry egg in through
door.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttt(through above)
ttYo, balloon man, we've got some real work
ttfor you:  How about analyzing this?

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Egon looks around, reacts to egg.

<b>ttttEGON
</b>ttInteresting.  That's the second biggest egg
ttI've ever seen.

Peter and Slimer set egg on Egon's desk.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttI don't wanna hear about it, Egon.  We've
tthad a long night in a not-too-fragrant
ttbarnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting
ttthe sheets.

Peter EXITS as Slimer ZIPS in close beside Egon, elbows on desk, chin in
hands, eyeing Egon and egg expectantly.  Egon pushes glasses up off tip of
nose and blinks at egg, not sure what to do with it.  CAMERA MOVES IN on
egg and we --

<b>tttttttMATCH-DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. -- FULL MOON IN COUNTRY SKY -- NIGHT
</b>
CAMERA PANS DOWN from full moon to reveal the tiny figures of Ray and
Winston approaching an old barn.  They stop, shining their flashlights on
closed main door.

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b>ttt(tired)
ttRay, it's gettin' pretty late.  Maybe there
ttreally isn't any...

<b>ttttRAY
</b>ttt(holds up one hand)
ttShh!

Ray extends his PKE meter toward barn.  It BEEPS incessantly.

</b>ttt(low voice)
ttIt's in there.

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b>ttt(unclipping his blaster)
ttThen let's get it!

<b>INT. BARN -- HIGH ANGLE ON MAIN DOOR -- WERECHICKEN'S POV
</b>
Through its RED EYES we see the barn door slowly CREAK open, revealing Ray
and Winston peering in.

<b>CLOSER ANGLE -- RAY AND WINSTON
</b>
They ENTER cautiously, Ray holding his BEEPING meter out before him.  The
barn is dark except for the moonlight slanting through the loft window and
the beams of their flashlights.  As the WIND picks up, WOOD CREAKS, HAY
RUSTLES, and a piece of JUNKY machinery turns with a SQUEAL.

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b><b>ttt(WHISPER)
</b>ttMan, this place is creepy.

<b>ttttRAY
</b><b>ttt(WHISPER)
</b>ttIt's in here -- I can feel it.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
Suddenly the door SLAMS shut behind them and the FLAP OF BEATING WINGS
SCURRIES through the darkness.  Winston JUMPS.

<b>ttttWINSTON
</b>ttLook out!

Ray shines his flashlight toward the lofts.  Its beam catches a couple of
startled pigeons as they fly out the window, pinion feathers WHISTLING.

Still backing up.

The proton streams catch the Werechicken in mid-air as it vaults toward
Ray and Winston, halting its leap and suspending it in a corona of proton
energy.

<b>ttttWERECHICKEN
</b><b>ttt(SHRIEKS)
</b>
A HIDEOUS SPIRIT rises from its writhing body -- shapeless, but with
monstrous glowing eyes and fangs.  The spirit lets out a ROAR more
frightening than the Werechicken howl.

<b>ttttSPIRIT
</b>ttt(big ROAR)

Ray, still firing his gun, snaps a trap loose from his belt, and tosses it
onto the barn floor.  It POPS open.

Ray and Winston, struggling with the writhing Spirit caught in the
streams, guide the Spirit into the trap.

</b>ttWe've almost got him!

</b>
The Spirit is sucked into the trap, which SLAMS shut.

It CLUCKS, starts pecking at the dirt.

They head for the door.  Winston stops.

</b>ttRay, I just had a thought...

Ray pauses to look around at Winston.

<b>ttttWINSTON (CONT)
</b>ttWhat if that six-foot werechicken is Zeke's

And off their looks, we --

Egon carries the big egg into kitchen, Slimer helping.

ttThanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't

With his elbow, Egon opens refrigerator with and the two of them place the
giant egg inside.

ttBut it'll be safe in here.

Slimer is SNORING, hovering above Peter's empty bed.

<b>ttttSLIMER
</b><b>ttt(SNORING)
</b>
<b>CLOSE ON SLIMER
</b>
In a BUBBLE above him, we see Slimer's DREAM, various kinds of food
dancing and SINGING the first two bars of Los Lobos' "LA BAMBA" a la the
California Raisins in "I Heard It Through The Grapevine."  Still asleep,
Slimer licks his lips hungrily, opens his mouth incredibly wide and
pounces on the entire dream balloon with a teeth-jarring CHOMP! that POPS
the dream bubble so that it EXPLODES inside his mouth, waking him up.
Slimer sits up with a wide-eyed, hungry look, rubbing his tummy.

<b>ttttSLIMER
</b>ttFooooood.

He zips o.s.

<b>INT. -- KITCHEN
</b>
Dark.  Lights go on, then Slimer SKIDS to mid-air stop and whips open
fridge.  His eyes pop as he sees the egg.

<b>ttttSLIMER
</b>ttt(licking his lips)
ttYummy!

Slimer rolls egg toward edge of shelf, then the full weight of the egg
drives Slimer straight to the floor.  The egg bounces on his stomach twice
before he gets a grip on it.  Straining his little green brains out, he
floats the egg up into the air and o.s.

<b>ttttSLIMER
</b>ttt(SQUEALS, then GRUNTS)

<b>ANGLE ON OVEN
</b>
Slimer shoves egg in the open oven, closes door, turns on the heat, then
moves O.S.  The oven interior glows red and the egg starts to quiver.

<b>ON SLIMER
</b>
Slimer HUMS as he busily sets table for one:  placemat, a plate, utensils,
salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, mayo, relish, ... a flurry of activity
that all focuses on his personal eating spot.

<b>ttttSLIMER
</b>ttt(HUMMING through above)

<b>ANGLE ON OVEN
</b>
Through window we see the egg shake and then begin to crack open.

<b>RESUME ON SLIMER
</b>
Hovering at table, still preparing for feast.  He puts on a bib, unaware
of oven shaking behind him.

<b>ttttSLIMER

With a loud BANG, the oven practically explodes and the door flies off.
Out pops a BABY WERECHICKEN, SNARLING and CACKLING.

The balloon and surrounding clouds start to freeze, turning white and
forming ice on them.  Suddenly, snow starts to fall.

He sticks his tongue out and catches some snowflakes.

Blizzard-like snow pelts it.  The chicken begins to stiffen and turn white
with frost.
