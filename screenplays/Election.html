tELECTION by Alexander Payne & JIM Taylor
<b>t
</b>tThird Draft July 22,1997
<b>t
</b>tBased on the novels by Tom Perotta
<b>t
</b><b>t
</b><b>tEXT. MILLARD HIGH -- DAWN
</b><b>t
</b>tThe school stretches out before us, slumbering in the overcast morning 
tair.
<b>t
</b>tAlong the front sidewalk, a lone JANITOR trundles a garbage bin filled 
twith overstuffed hefty bags.
<b>t
</b>tA weathered FORD ESCORT pulls into the empty PARKING LOT and comes to 
ta stop near the athletic field.
<b>t
</b><b>tA TEENAGE GIRL'S VOICE -
</b><b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY (VO) 
</b>tttNone of this would have happened if Mr. 
tttMcAllister hadn't meddled the way he 
tttdid.  He should have just accepted 
tttthings as they are instead of trying to 
tttinterfere with destiny.  You see, you 
tttcan't interfere with destiny.  That's 
tttwhy it's destiny.  And if you try to 
tttinterfere, the same thing's going to 
ttthappen anyway, and you'll just suffer.
<b>t
</b>tJIM MCALLISTER, a teacher in his mid to late-thirties, emerges from 
tthe car in running clothes and carrying a briefcase, gym bag, and 
tcoffee mug.  On his way to the field, he crosses paths with the 
tjanitor.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttMorning, Lowell
<b>t
</b>tLowell nods, hoists a bag and tosses it into a dumpster.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. ATHLETIC FIELD -- DAWN
</b><b>t
</b>tJIM CIRCLES THE TRACK, sweating and panting.
<b>t
</b>tON THE GROUND JIM does sit ups
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttTwenty-one... twenty-two.
<b>t
</b>tHe collapses onto his back.  His head rolls to one side, and he 
tglances past the fence at --
<b>t
</b><b>tTHE PARKING LOT
</b><b>t
</b>tWhere a second CAR is just arriving.  JIM watches as TRACY FLICK, a 
tjunior, and her MOTHER get out.
<b>t
</b>tThe mother helps remove a CARD TABLE and a big plastic sack from the 
ttrunk before Tracy heads toward the school.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMOTHER
</b>ttttt(distant)
tttGood luck!
<b>t
</b>tJIM turns his gaze toward the sky, closes his eyes, sighs.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.    BOYS'    LOCKER   ROOM   --   DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tNaked in the showers, JIM pumps liquid soap from the wall- mounted 
tmetal dispenser.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT.   HILLARD   HALL  DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tTHE LEGS OF A CARD TABLE - as Tracy spreads them open and locks them 
tinto place.
<b>t
</b>tSTICKS OF GUM from a Plen-T-Pack are emptied into a FISHBOWL-
<b>t
</b>tSCOTCH TAPE is wrapped around the end of a pen to attach a piece of 
tstring
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. BOYS' LOCKER ROOMtDAY
</b><b>t
</b><b>tAT THE MIRROR
</b><b>t
</b>tJIM adjusts the knot of his tie, notices a little shaving cream in his 
tear.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. MILLARD HALLtDAY
</b><b>t
</b>tFOUR CLIPBOARDS  with pens and lined sheets of paper are being placed 
tin a row like little soldiers. The top of every sheet reads "Tracy 
tFlick for President: Official Nomination Signatures."
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. FACULTY LOUNGE -- MORNING
</b><b>t
</b><b>tAT THE REFRIGERATOR
</b><b>t
</b>tJIM tries to place his lunch inside, but the shelves are too crammed 
twith old take-out containers. He opens one and smells it. Disgusted, 
the drags a garbage can over and begins throwing things away.
<b>t
</b>tLowell appears in the doorway wheeling his squeaky maintenance cart 
tand watches JIM conduct his purge as A CHINESE FOOD BOX misses the can 
tand rolls on the floor.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. MILLARD HALLWAY -- DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tTracy is seated behind her card table strategically placed near the 
tschool's main entrance.  A sign taped to the wall behind her reads, 
tTRACY FOR PREZ.  SIGN UP FOR TOMORROW, TODAY!  She checks her watch, 
treadies herself.
<b>t
</b>tJIM walks around the corner whistling vaguely.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttGood morning, Mr. McAllister.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttNot wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>ttttt(chirping)
tttYou know what they say about the early 
tttbird.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttYes, I do.
<b>t
</b>tAn awkward moment passes between them.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttWell, good luck there, Tracy
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttThanks, Mr. M.
<b>t
</b>tAS JIM turns and walks away, Tracy watches him.  He stops and picks up 
tsome litter, tosses it in a nearby garbage can.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY (VO)
</b>tttNo matter what he says, Mr. McAllister 
ttthad it out for me from the start.  Oh 
tttsure, he was all smiles and good wishes 
tttand everything, but underneath he was 
tttjust as unfair and petty as anybody 
tttelse.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. JIM'S CLASSROOMtDAY 
</b><b>t
</b>tAlone in his room, JIM studies the Omaha World-Herald
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY (VO CONT'D) 
</b>tttHe'll probably tell you how committed 
ttthe was to teaching and democracy and 
tttintegrity and all. Don't be fooled.
<b>t
</b>tAfter laying the paper down to circle an article, JIM leans back in 
this chair and momentarily loses himself in thought.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO)
</b>tttIt's hard to remember how the whole 
tttthing started, the whole election mess. 
tttWhat I do remember is that I loved my 
tttjob. I was a teacher, an educator, and I 
tttcouldn't imagine doing anything else.
<b>t
</b>tSuddenly a VOICE --
<b>t
</b><b>tttttVOICE (OS)
</b>tttHey, Mr. M. Mr. M.!
<b>t
</b>tJIM glances OUT THE WINDOW and sees a kid -- PAUL METZLER -- pointing 
tat him. Paul walks with a LIMP. Behind him, other STUDENTS approach 
tthe school.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttPAUL
</b>tttStop daydreaming! Get back to work!
<b>t
</b>tJIM enjoys the affectionate joshing and gives the kid  a wave. He 
treturns to his newspaper, a contented man.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO)
</b>tttThe students knew it wasn't just a job 
tttfor me.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. MILARD HIGH FOOTBALL STADIUMt-- NIGHT 
</b><b>t
</b>tJIM sits in the bleachers, clapping his  hands  over his head.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttC'mon, wolverines!  Defense!  Let's 
ttthold 'em back!
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO)
</b>tttI got involved. And I cared.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. MILLARD GYM    DAY  AT A PEP RALLY -
</b><b>t
</b>tJIM is dressed as a WESTERN VILLAIN, and his black hat reads "Lincoln 
tSouth." With a menacing grimace he approaches a group of FOOTBALL 
tPLAYERS at a poker table.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttAnd I think I made a difference.
<b>t
</b><b>tA CORNER OF THE SCHOOL    DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tJIM has a comforting hand of the shoulder of a CRYING GIRL
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttI knew I touched the students' lives 
tttduring their difficult young adult 
tttyears, and I took that responsibility 
tttseriously.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT 
</b><b>t
</b>tJIM trots up the stairs to receive a plaque. He beams.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttIn the twelve years I taught U.S. 
tttHistory, Civics and current Events at 
tttMillard, I was voted Teacher of the Year 
tttthree times - a school record.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. JIM'S CLASSROOM -- DAY
</b><b>t
</b>tMr. McAllister reads aloud from the newspaper as he paces in front of 
this class of high school juniors, Tracy Flick among them. The seats 
tare arranged in a SEMI-CIRCLE.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttStanding in front of a room full of 
tttyoung people, trying to make them think 
tttthat's how I wanted to spend the rest 
tttof my life,
<b>t
</b>tJIM slaps the newspaper for emphasis and addresses the class
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM 
</b>tttSo would this be an ethical situation 
tttor a moral situation? What's the 
tttdifference between ethics and morals, 
tttanyway?
<b>t
</b>tTracy shoots her hand into the air.  JIM notices but keeps looking 
taround.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (CONT'D)
</b>tttAnybody
<b>t
</b>tOther hands rise tentatively
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (CONT'D)
</b>tttDerek
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDEREK
</b>tttUh, ethics is like when you, uh, do 
tttwhat society tells you is right and 
tttmorals are like, uh...
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttYou're on the right track,  who can 
ttthelp him out?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDEREK
</b>ttt..morals are when...
<b>t
</b>tTracy's hand goes higher.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttMichelle?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMICHELLE
</b>tttMorals are like lessons, you know, like 
tttthe moral of a story; it's what you 
tttlearn from a story or a fable or 
tttsomething. . .
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttOr a life experience.  Good.  And 
tttethics?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttMICHELLE
</b>tttThat's more like, urn... Ethics is how 
tttyou use the morals... that you learn 
tttfrom a story?
<b>t
</b>tJIM weighs the answer, tries to be encouraging.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttOkay.  But we're still missing 
tttsomething key here.  What are we 
tttmissing?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>ttttt(hand still raised)
tttI know.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>ttttt(finally)
tttTracy.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttEthics are...
<b>t
</b>tFREEZE FRAME on Tracy, her hand lowering, her mouth agape.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO)
</b>tttTracy Flick.  Tracy Flick.  I've never 
tttmet anyone quite like Tracy Flick.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM -- DAY -- ONE YEAR PREVIOUS
</b><b>t
</b>tJIM sits to one side, monitoring the student council MEETING about to 
tconvene.  A younger Tracy enters briskly and, unlike her casual teen 
tcomrades, has made an attempt to dress for success.  She takes a seat 
tright up front and opens her backpack.
<b>t
</b>tAfter preparing her notepad and pen, Tracy puts a MICROCASSETTE 
tRECORDER on the table in front of her and pushes RECORD.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttShe first showed up in my life as a 
tttfreshman delegate in student council. 
tttI'd seen a lot of ambitious students 
tttcome and go over the years, but I could 
ttttell right away Tracy Flick was 
tttdifferent.
<b>t
</b>tJIM observes Tracy, trying to size her up.
<b>t
</b>tON TRACY -- putting all her little things in order, finally folding 
ther hands to wait.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttIt wasn't long before everyone knew who 
tttTracy Flick was.  She made sure of that.  
tttHer drive was astonishing.  Even scary.
<b>t
</b><b>tA FAST-PACED MONTAGE BEGINS UNDER TRACY'S VOICE-OVER:

</b>tINSERTtHILLARD HIGH YEARBOOK It fans open to the INDEX.
<b>t
</b>tPAN DOWN to Tracy's name followed by countless page references
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttSome people say I'm an overachiever, 
tttbut I think they're just jealous.
<b>t
</b>tA page number turns BOLD, and the other numbers drop away
<b>t
</b>tSuddenly we are on that page, and we PAN to a headline: "Spanish Club 
tsays Oh La!"
<b>t
</b>tPAN to the group shot and ZOOM in on Tracy smiling in a big SOMBRERO.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttMy Mom always tells me I'm different -- 
tttyou know, special. And if you look at 
tttall the things I've accomplished so far, 
tttI think you'd have to agree.
<b>t
</b>tWe see Tracy on other pages too: "Yearbook Staff goes for it!" "Junior 
tAchievers put on the dog!" "Student Council meets the challenge;" 
tOklahoma's a hit!
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY (VO CONT'D) 
</b>tttHere I am in Oklahoma.
<b>t
</b>tThe STILL of Tracy in Oklahoma suddenly COMES TO LIFE.

tttI'm just a girl who can't say no...
<b>t
</b><b>tTV INSERT/INT. CAFETERIAtDAY
</b><b>t
</b>tIt's the closed-circuit school NEWS BROADCAST. Tracy is delivering a 
tstand-up report from the crowded cafeteria. Her dress and makeup are 
tan obvious if lame emulation of a professional newswoman.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY (VO)
</b>tttAnd here I am on KMHS, our student-run 
tttTV station.

</b><b>t
</b>tA Student Council meeting is underway led by the president, LARRY 
tFOUCH.  A girl, ASHLEY, is speaking.  JIM observes from the side.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY (VO)
</b>tttBut it was in SGA, the Student 
tttGovernment Association, where I made my 
tttbiggest mark.  I never missed a meeting, 
tttand I volunteered for every committee as 
tttlong as I could lead it.
<b>t
</b>tBefore Ashley can finish, Tracy STANDS UP
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttI agree with Ashley.  We should rent

<b>t

</b>tttHer pussy gets so wet you can't believe 
tttit.
<b>t
</b><b>tWIDE -
</b><b>t
</b>tDave is leaning across his desk to speak with JIM at an adjacent work 
tarea.  They eat sack lunches.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO)
</b>tttA few months before the election, she'd 
ttthad an affair with my best friend Dave 
tttNovotny.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttDon't tell me that.  I don't want to 
tttknow that.
<b>t

</b>tttShe's incredible.  Everything just gets 
tttsoaked.
<b>t
</b>tINT. JIM'S BASEMENTtDAY Dun-dun-DUN... Dun-dun-DUN
<b>t
</b>tJIM and Dave are playing the opening notes of "Foxy Lady" through 
tcheap, distorting amps. JIM plays bass. Dave plays guitar and sings 
tinto a microphone. They're bad. As in not good.
<b>t
</b>tThe basement is typical of a Midwest middle-class young couple -- half 
tstorage and laundry, half makeshift roc-room.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO)
</b>tttDave came to Millard the year after I 
tttdid, and we hit it off right away. We 
tttbacked each other up in teachers' 
tttmeetings and shared an interest in 60's 
tttmusic and micro-breweries.
<b>t
</b>tCLOSE ON DAVE really getting into it, playing to an unseen stadium. 
tBehind him JIM is very careful with his chords.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttYou could tell Dave was one of those 
tttguys who taught because they never 
tttwanted to leave high school in the first 
tttplace, and that could get a little 
tttirritating sometimes, but basically he 
tttwas a real good guy.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDAVE 
</b>ttttt(singing)
tttFoxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a 
tttcute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You

</b><b>t
</b>tCAMERA DRIFTS from the open basement stairway door and toward DIANE 
tMCALLISTER and SHERRY NOVOTNY seated at the kitchen  table. They are 
tfussing over little six-month-old DARRYL NOVOTNY in his highchair.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM (VO)
</b>tttOur wives became best friends too. And 
tttwhen Dave and Sherry's son Darryl was 
tttborn, they asked us to be godparents.
<b>t
</b>tAt a particularly grating note from downstairs, Diane gets up and 
tcloses the basement door.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. GEOMETRY CLASS
</b><b>t
</b>tAN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE is being drawn on the blackboard and bisected. 
tPULL  OUT to reveal Dave explaining.
<b>t
</b>tThe class is taking notes, and we zero in on a younger Tracy.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttYOU probably think the worst - that Mr. 
tttNovotny was just taking advantage of one 
tttof his students, but it wasn't like that 
tttat all. Our relationship was based on 
tttmutual respect and admiration. I mean, 
tttduring my sophomore year in geometry it 
tttwas strictly professional between us -- 
tttI mean, nothing.
<b>t
</b>tEXT. GODFATHER'S PIZZA -- NIGHT The parking lot, the neon lights, the 
tpromise of good times.

twith six other students.
<b>t
</b><b>tTWO KIDS  DISSOLVE OUT OF FRAME,

tsame way, until only Dave and Tracy remain.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>tttOne night he took us editors out to 
tttcelebrate after a deadline. Eventually 
tttDave and I were left alone and we got to 
ttttalking - not like teacher and student, 
tttbut like two adults.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDAVE
</b>tttYou know, Tracy... I don't know how to 
tttsay this, but...
<b>t
</b>tDave's finger traces the rim of his frosty root beer mug.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttwhat?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDAVE
</b>tttWell, I notice you don't seem to have 
tttany close friends at Millard. You seem 
tttto be kind of a loner.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttNo, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDAVE
</b>tttI know.  I know its not by choice.  I 
tttjust mean, well, being the kind of 
tttperson you are, it must be really 
tttdifficult to find someone you can talk 
tttto.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttWhat do you mean? What kind of person 
tttam I?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDAVE
</b>tttWhat kind of person?
<b>t
</b>tDave looks directly into her eyes.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDAVE (CONT'D)
</b>tttTracy, I've been watching you for going 
ttton two years now, and I think you are 
tttone of the most talented, hard-working, 
tttsensitive, attractive, brilliant 
tttstudents -- no, human beings -- I have 
tttever met.  I mean, you're the real 
tttthing.  Special.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>ttttt(embarrassed, low)
tttThank you.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDAVE
</b>tttAnd I know sometimes people like you 
ttthave to pay a price for their greatness, 
tttand that price is loneliness.
<b>t
</b>tTracy nods in quiet recognition.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDAVE (CONT'D)
</b>tttI don't know.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But it 
tttseems like you might need a friend.

tttlooking for a father figure.

<b>t
</b>tTracy is seated awkwardly at one end of the sofa, a Diet Dr. Pepper in 
tone hand.  Dave walks slowly toward her, a sexy, knowing look in his 
teye.  The music is sexy.  Tracy is sexy. He's sexy.  Keeping his eyes 
tlocked on Tracy's, he takes the pop can from her hand and takes a sip 
thimself.  Sexy.

</b>tttLook, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all 
tttseems crazy, and maybe it did start out, 
tttyou know, for the... for the sex and the 
tttdanger.  But now it's different.  Jim, 
tttwhat I'm trying to tell you is that 
tttTracy and I are totally, totally in 
tttlove.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttIn love?
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDAVE
</b>tttYeah, it's serious.  I mean she 
tttinspires me in ways Sherry never has.  
tttShe even wants to read my novel.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttBut you haven't written your novel.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDAVE
</b>tttThat's the whole point. It's all in my

tttwrite it so she can read it.  It's 
tttbeautiful.

</b>tttThank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again, 
tttJerry is running unopposed for Vice 
tttPresident. So we'll move on now to the 
tttpresidential race with three candidates 
tttrunning. The first in alphabetical order 
tttis Tracy Flick.

tspeech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at them.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttPoet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, "I 
tttcannot make my days longer, so I strive 
tttto make them better."  With this 
tttelection, we here at Millard also have 
tttan opportunity to make our high school 
tttdays better.  During this campaign I 
ttthave had the opportunity to speak with 
tttmany of you about your concerns.  I 
tttspoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who 
ttttold me how alienated she feels from her 
tttown homeroom.  I spoke with sophomore 
tttReggie Banks, who said his mother works 
tttin a cafeteria and can't afford to buy 
ttthim enough spiral notebooks for his 
tttclasses.  I won't bore you with long-
tttwinded promises about all the new and 
tttinnovative things I will definitely 
tttachieve during the year in which it will 
tttbe my honor and privilege to represent 
ttteach and every one of you, but I can say 
tttthat my years of experience on the 
tttstudent council have taught me the three 
tttmost important attributes the president 
tttneeds to possess;  commitment -
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDOUG SCHENKEN
</b>tttEat me
<b>t
</b><b>tttttDOUG'S BUDDY 
</b>tttEat me raw!
<b>t
</b>tThere is  scattered laughter. Tracy pauses, wait Hendricks bounds up 
tand grabs the mike.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttWALT
</b>tttIf you can't be adults and give these 
tttcandidates the courtesy they deserve, 
tttthen you don't deserve to be called 
tttadults but children* Because that's what 
tttchildren are. And you'll be treated like 
tttchildren. So let's all listen up.
<b>t
</b>tWalt backs away to his seat. Tracy resumes
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttThe three most important attributes the 
tttpresident needs to possess are: 
tttcommitment, qualifications, and 
tttexperience.  I'll add one more; caring.  
tttI care about Millard, and I care about 
ttteach and every one of you, and together 
tttwe can all make a difference.  One of 
tttthe things I would like to establish is 
ttta regular open forum where any student 
tttcan come and voice their concern about 
tttissues we face here at Millard.  I and 
tttthe rest of the student council would 
tttthen interface with the faculty and 
tttstaff, so a continuous dialogue would 
tttexist.
<b>t
</b>tWalt whispers to Jim.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttWALT
</b>tttI'd say she knows a thing or two about 
tttstudent-faculty dialogue.
<b>t
</b>tJIM nods solemnly
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttWhen you cast your vote for Tracy Flick 
tttnext week, you won't just be voting for 
tttme.  You'll be voting for yourself and 
tttfor every other student Our days won't 
tttbe any longer, but they can sure be 
tttbetter.  Thank you.
<b>t
</b>tTracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair.  There is polite 
tapplause and a few whistles.  JJJB comes back to the microphone.
<b>t
</b>tTracy takes her seat next to Paul and glances at him.  Paul scares 
tstraight ahead, a fat bead of sweat on his forehead. One of his legs 
tis jiggling.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttThe next candidate for student body 
tttpresident is Paul Metzier.  Paul?
<b>t
</b>tPaul awkwardly makes his way to the mike.   Though by no means 
tthunderous, his applause clearly exceeds Tracy's.  A small cluster of 
tjocks "woof" for him, shaking their fists in the air.  Paul manages a 
tweak grin for his buddies.
<b>t
</b>tTracy shifts in her chair, her smile stiff and forced
<b>t
</b>tLisa smiles and nods at Paul from the bleachers, giving him 
tencouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they talked 
tabout.
<b>t
</b>tTammy's eyes dart between Lisa and Paul. She shows no emotion, reveals 
tnothing.
<b>t
</b>tThe applause quickly dies, and after a moment Paul remembers to look 
tat the white paper in his hand. He speaks in a barely audible 
tmonotone, never once glancing up.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttPAUL
</b>tttAs many of you know I broke my leg 
tttpretty bad thi3 year and the experience 
ttthas made me reevaluate what I want to do 
tttwith my life and that is help people 
tttwhen you think about it a school is more 
tttthan a school it's our second home where 
tttwe spend all cur time and grow as 
tttindividuals and a community but is our

tttis why I am running for president.

<b>t
</b>tA few loud SOUND EFFECT SNORES saw through the air, and Walt points a 
tstern finger at - you guessed it -- Doug Schenken.

</b>tttI know what it is to fight hard and win 
tttlike when we almost went to state last 
tttfall and I threw that fourth-quarter 
tttpass against Westside for the touchdown 
tttthat won the game by three points I 
tttwon't let you down like I didn't then I 
tttpromise we can all score a winning
ttttt(big breath)

tttfor president thank you.
<b>t
</b>tPaul now gets considerably less applause, but his jock friends remain 
tloyal.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttOkay, Paul. Now our final candidate for 
tttPresident - another one of the Metzier 
tttclan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier.
<b>t
</b>tTammy approaches the mike. There are scattered mocking whistles and 
tcatcalls.

tShe makes eye contact with Lisa, who stares back.

<b>t
</b>tNOW there's something worth listening to.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTAMMY (CONT'D)
</b>tttWe all know it doesn't matter who gets 
tttelected president of Millard. You think 
tttit's going to change anything around 
ttthere, make one single person happier or 
tttsmarter or nicer? The only person it 
tttmatters to is the one who gets elected.  
tttThe same pathetic charade happens every 
tttyear, and everyone makes the same 
tttpathetic promises just so they can put 
tttit on their transcripts to get into 
tttcollege.  So vote for me, because I 
tttdon't even want to go to college, and I 
tttdon't care, and as president I won't do 
tttanything.  The only promise I make is 
tttthat if elected I will immediately 
tttdismantle the student government, so 
tttthat none of us will ever have to sit 
tttthrough one of these stupid assemblies 
tttagain!
<b>t
</b>tThere is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and applause.  
tTammy has set them free.  Even cynical old Doug Schenken and his 
tbuddies join in.

<b>t
</b>tIn total control, she steps back from the mike and CURTSIES.

</b>tWalt shoots an angry, confused look at Jim, who shrugs. Tracy is 
tclearly upset, but her smile remains eerily fixed Paul just looks 
tconfused and ashamed.  Jerry Slavin is convulsed in laughter and 
tchants along with the multitude.

</b>tttThis isn't the time or the place to get 
tttinto it, but there is, for just one 
tttexample, a certain former colleague of 
tttmine, who made a very big mistake, a 
tttlife mistake.  I think the lesson there 
tttis that, old and young, we ail make 
tttmistakes, and we have to learn that our 
tttactions, all of them, can carry serious 
tttconsequences.  You're very young, Tracy 
tttunderage, in fact -- but maybe one
tttday you'll understand.
<b>t

tttwiser people hadn't acted like such 
tttlittle babies and gotten all mushy, 
ttteverything would be okay.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttJIM
</b>tttI agree.  But I also think certain 
tttyoung and naive people need to thank 
ttttheir lucky stars and be very, very 
tttgrateful the whole school didn't find 
tttout about certain indiscretions which 
tttcould have ruined their reputations, and 
tttchances to win certain elections.
<b>t
</b><b>tttttTRACY
</b>tttAnd I think certain older persons like 
tttyou and your "colleague" shouldn't be 
tttleaching after their students, 
tttespecially when some of them can't even 
tttget their own wives pregnant.  And they 
tttcertainly shouldn't be running around 
tttmaking slanderous accusations.  
tttEspecially when certain young, naive 
tttpeople's mothers are para-legal 
tttsecretaries at the city's biggest law 
tttfirm and have won many successful 
tttlawsuits. And if you want to keep 
tttquestioning me like this, I won't
