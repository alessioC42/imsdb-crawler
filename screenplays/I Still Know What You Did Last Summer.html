<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tTITLE SEQUENCE:
</b>
<b>1tINT. BOSTON - OLD NORTH CHURCH - DAY
</b>
tThe setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images. Holy
timages of STAINED GLASS and lead.

tFOOTSTEPS ECHO across the marble floor.

<b>tREVEAL - JULIE JAMES
</b>
tA little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt. But
tshe's all alone in the house of the Lord.

tAnd those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden
tstill rests upon her soul.

tShe reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained
<b>tCONFESSIONAL BOOTH.
</b>
<b>2tINT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY
</b>
tJulie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters, kneeling before
tthe CLOSED SCREEN. A beat -- and the SCREEN SLIDES OPEN.

<b>tA PRIEST
</b>
tenters the adjacent booth -- barely visible through the WICKER MESH.
tJulie looks down, crosses herself, and begins.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttBless me, Father, for I have sinned.
tttt(a beat)
tttIt's been a year since my last
tttconfession...

tJulie swallows hard. This is difficult for her.

tttttJULIE (cont'd)
tttI've never told anyone this. Not my
tttmom, not the poice, not even my
tttfriends -- except for the ones who
tttwere there and they...well they're
tttnot around anymore. You see I...I...

<b>tttttPRIEST
</b>tttYes?

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI killed a man. Well, I thought I
ttthad...then...

tShe balks at the memory of it. The priest bows his head in the shadows
tof the other side.

tttttJULIE (cont'd)
tttt(emotional)
tttYou've got to understand...It was
tttall an accident. A terrible accident.
tttIt's been a whole year. I've tried to
tttget past this, but I just can't.

<b>tttttPRIEST
</b>tttGo on...

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI have these dreams...horrible
tttdreams. And this man is always there
tttwith me.

<b>tttttPRIEST
</b>tttt(reassuring)
tttI know...

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttYou see, he was a killer. He
tttmurdered Helen and Barry, and he
tttwould have killed me too, if I
ttthadn't...gotten away with it.
tttt(regathering)
tttI don't know, I guess I just need to
tttdeal with the fear, the guilt...to
tttfinally say his name. Ben Willis. His
tttname was Ben Willis...

tThe confession is cathartic for Julie. She looks relieved until,

<b>tttttPRIEST
</b>tttI know...

tJulie stops. Looks through the screen. A chill shoots through her
tbody.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttYou know? But how could you...

tClouds of icy steam shoot through the partition. Julie moves closer to
tthe screen, trying to get a better look.

<b>tttttPRIEST
</b>tttt(growls)
<b>tttI KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!!!
</b>
<b>tA STEEL HOOK
</b>
tsmashes through the screen right in Julie's face! She SCREAMS!

<b>tttttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>3tINT. COLLEDGE LECTURE HALL - DAY
</b>
tStill screaming -- Julie jumps back, seemingly knocked out of her
tchair. She fights the unseen demon.

tSitting beside her, Julie's friend WILL BENSON reacts. He's a good-
tlooking kid in a shy, humble kind of way. And he tries to help her,
tbut she's too busy turning ten shades of red.

tThe PROFESSOR lowers his glasses, makes it even worse.

<b>tttttPROFESSOR
</b>tttNice to see you find Political
tttScience so stimulating --

tThe lecture hall erupts with laughter.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI'm sorry --

tJulie grabs her stuff and bolts.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>4tEXT. CAMPUS - DAY
</b>
tJulie explodes out of the building. Hurries down a sidewalk. Will
tfinally catches up.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttJulie! Wait! You okay?

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI'm fine.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttYou sure?

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI'm fine.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttYou don't seem fine.

tJulie realizes this is true.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI had another dream, Will.

tWill takes this seriously.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttThe shower again?

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttIt was in a church...it was so real.
tttI mean, I could feel his breath on me.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttt(caring)
tttI'm sorry.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI thought I was over the dreams for
tttgood. I really did. I hadn't had one
tttfor months.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttIt just takes time, Julie. It's gonna
tttget better.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttIt can't get worse. I mean, it's not
tttlike this was the first time I
tttfreaked out in class. I hardly ever
tttget a full night's sleep, my grades
tttsuck, I'm this close from being thrown
tttout of school.

tBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EXPLOSIONS. Julie jumps out of her skin. It's just
tSTUDENTS letting off FIRECRACKERS as they fly past on bicycles.

tWill and Julie are now thinking the same thing.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttt(cont'd)
tttIt was one year ago...

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttIt's...the anniversary. That's what's
tttgoing on...Take it easy on yourself.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttt(weary)
tttI'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I
tttdon't even know why I came up here in
tttthe first place.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttt(cheering her up)
tttTo get out of Southport?

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttt(softens)
tttRight. Now I remember.

tHe smiles at her. She smiles back. They stop in front of her apartment
tbuilding.

tttttJULIE (cont'd)
tttAre you getting out of town on the
tttfourth?

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttNah. I'll probably just be here
tttstudying for finals. The joys of
tttsummer school...
tttt(beat)
tttAre you okay?

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI'm okay.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttAre you sure?

tShe touches his face affectionately.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttThanks for the talk, Will. You're
tttgood to me.

tWill stands there akwardly --

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttUm...Okay. Bye.

tWill walks away. Julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk --

<b>tRAY
</b>
tsteps out of the shadows. Julie practically faints.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttOh, my god, Ray. You scared me.

tRecovering, she hugs Ray, genuinely glad to see him. He's a bit cold.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttI got in early. I was excited...
tttt(re: the receding Will)
tttWho was that guy?

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttOh, that's Will. He's a friend.
tttYou'd like him.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttYeah.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttRay, we're just friend.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttEvery guy in history who tried to
tttpick up a girl did the good-friend
tttthing first.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttWhy are you being like this?

tIt should be obvious Ray feels insecure in the college environs, but
tthey're miscommunicating.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttHey, I'm sorry. You're right. Are
tttyou ready to go? I've got the old
ttttruck. You know the drill...Crab
tttboil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen
tttPageant...It's only small-town fun,
tttbut it's still nice. People really
tttmiss you. I miss you.

tShe looks at Ray, his compassionate demeanor. This is hard to say --

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttt(softly, but resolved)
tttRay, I can't...

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttCan't what?

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI just feel like some part of me
ttthasn't healed up enough to go back.
tttLike some critical piece is missing.
tttPlease understand...

tRay is cold. This is what he's expected all along.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttI understand something.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttIt's not like that. It's not you.
tttIt's me. My head. I want to go back.
tttI want to be with you. I want to be
tttfine. I want everything to be like
tttit used to be.
tttt(beat)
tttIt just isn't.

tRay is hurt and confused.

tttttJULIE (cont'd)
tttHey, why don't you stay up here?
tttThey have fireworks over the river.
tttAnd...there's a million things to do.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttI have to work, Julie. My boat's in
tttSouthport, remember? But, I get it.
tttYou need your space from Craokerland.
tttAnd maybe from me, too.

tRay starts walking away.

tttttRAY (cont'd)
tttYou know where to find me.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttRay? Ray? At least come up for a
tttwhile.

tRay keeps on walking.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttIt's okay. I'm just gonna go.

tJulie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block
ther way.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttRay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
tttt(to herself)
tttI'm just scared...that's all.

tBut Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns
tquickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the
twalk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from
tthe keychain.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>5tEXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>

tStudents throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck,
twhich is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW.

tHe clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket
tand pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He
tthrows it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>6tINT. JULIE'S APARTMENT DOORWAY - DAY
</b>
tJulie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She
tstands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a
tcat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen.

<b>6AtINT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
tThe faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the
tlock on each window. She stands for a moment.

tShe picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge
tand takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and
ta jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf.
tShe thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet.

tShe takes the whole mess toward her bedroom.

<b>6BtINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
tShe hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely
tfurnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the
twindows, then climbs into bed with the food.

tOn the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at
tone of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing.

tOutside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going
tplaces. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns
toff the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the
troom.

<b>tttttttttDISSOVE TO:
</b>
<b>6CtINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tJulie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed.

tThere's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER.

tJulie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the
tfront door being CLOSED.

tHer arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb
<b>tPOPS.
</b>
<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttt(whispers)
tttOkay. Okay. Face your fears...

tShe gets off the bed and stands still.

tttttJULIE (cont'd)
tttt(whisper)
tttThere's nothing...

tThere's another NOISE down the hall.

tttttJULIE (cont'd)
tttt(whisper)
tttQuiet.

tJulie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen.

<b>6DtINT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
tShe gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the
tliving room. She steps through the kitchen door.

tAs she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway
ttoward her bedroom.

<b>6EtINT. JULIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tThere's NO ONE there.

tttttJULIE (cont'd)
tttOkay, calm down, imagination.

tShe relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly AJAR, light
tfrom the hallway slanting through.

tttttJULIE (cont'd)
tttI can't take this anymore. I can't.

tHolding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's
ta soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of
ta drawer and starts down the hallway.

tttttJULIE (cont'd)
tttt(fatalistic)
tttLet's just do it.

tShe moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway.
tIt sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room.

<b>6FtINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tThere's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position.

tShe turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet.

<b>tINT THE CLOSET
</b>
tKARLA WILSON, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a
tbox of shoes. She SCREAMS.

tJulie SCREAMS. They both SCREAM together. Julie drops the knife and
tflashlight.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttI thought you were out of town!

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttWhat are you doing in my closet?

tThey hug, jumping up and down with relief.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttI thought you were out of town!

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttWhat are you doing in my closet?

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>ttti just wanted your black pants, but
tttI'm not ready to die for them!

tJulie turns on the light in the hallway. Karla has her shoes in her
thand and black pants draped over her arm.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttThat was heart attack time, Karla.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttNo. When I put these skinny pants on
tttmy body...Now, that's heart attack
ttttime.

tKarla looks down and sees the knife. She picks it up with two
tfingers --

tttttKARLA (cont'd)
tttAnd we're going to put away the
tttutensils and you're coming with me.

tJulie flops down on her bed.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI'm not going anywhere. I'm fat,
tttugly, and depressed.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttYeah, right -- whatever.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI think I just really hurt Ray's
tttfeelings.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttt(keeping it upbeat)
tttListen to me, Julie. Ray's a great
tttguy, nothing against old Ray, but
ttthe's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in
tttSouthport. Will's a nice guy, too,
tttand he lives right down the street.

tKarla picks up the flashlight and goes into the closet.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttThere's nothing between Will and me.

<b>tttttKARLA (V.O.)
</b>tttYet. Nothing yet.

tShe emerges with clothes for Julie. Holds up one outfit.

tttttKARLA (cont'd)
tttWhat we gotta do is keep moving. No
ttttime to mope. I'm working at the
tttclub tonight. And you, dancing queen,
tttare coming with me.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttNo I'm not.

tKarla holds up another dress for Julie -- strapless, sexy, the one.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttFine, then be fat, ugly, and
tttdepressed.

tKarla is dancing around. Julie laughs at her friend and takes the
tdress when Karla hands it to her.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>7tINT. THE CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tIt's a hopping college joint: crowded, loud MUSIC, a dance floor, and
trivers of cheap booze.

<b>tAT THE BAR
</b>
tJulie sits next to Karla as she waits for her drink order.

tA handsome young man slides in front of them. This is TYRELL MARTIN,
t23, handsome, no pretention, a little dangerous, with a killer smile.

<b>tttttTYRELL
</b>tttYou know what I want to do to you
ttt...right now, don't you? There's
tttgotta be somewhere we can be alone.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttt(playful)
tttI don't think so. It's pretty
tttcrowded.

<b>tttttTYRELL
</b>tttJust for a minute, baby. I got
tttsomething I wanna tell you.

tHe's looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttt(teasing)
tttIf you can say all you gotta say
tttin a minute then I don't wanna hear
tttit.

<b>tttttTYRELL
</b>tttI'll talk real slow.

tHe's kissing her ear. She starts to giggle.

tThe bartender sets down drinks on Karla's tray.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttt(re: Julie)
tttAsk her to dance.

tTyrell hesitates.

tttttKARLA (cont'd)
tttGo on.

tKarla cuts away through the crowd, delivering drinks. Tyrell turns to
tJulie.

<b>tttttTYRELL
</b>tttYou're the most beautiful woman
tttin the bar tonight, Jules.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttTyrell, you are an unstoppable
tttforce of nature.

<b>tttttTYRELL
</b>tttThat's right. It's how the species
tttsurvives. You'll never convince me
tttotherwise.
tttt(beat)
tttWanna dance?

tKarla passes by --

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttSay yes.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttNo.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttNo means yes.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttTyrell, I appreciate it, but have
tttyou seen my people dance? We make
tttthe mouth face, we move the
tttfingers --

<b>tttttTYRELL
</b>tttt(heading for the floor)
tttWorse comes to worse, you can stand
tttthere and watch me.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttCome on, I'll take a break and
tttwe'll all dance.

<b>7AtINT. THE CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>
tis packed and thumping. Karla is dancing her way through the crowd.
tTyrell and Julie follow behind her.

tKarla sees Will. He's dressed up and nervous. She smiles.

tttttKARLA (cont'd)
tttWhaddayou know? Will Benson lookin'
tttfine.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttt(suspicious, but
tttthaving fun)
tttKarla! Did you tell him I'd be here?

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttNope. I told him that you
tttabsolutely, positively would not be
ttthere at this bar between ten o'clock
tttand eleven o'clock tonight. And then
ttthe came anyway.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttt(shy to a fault)
tttThis was not my idea.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttWhat?

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttI said, this...Do you want a drink?

tWill looks down at his feet. He and Julie stand there not quite
tknowing what to do.

<b>tttttTYRELL
</b>tttWhere I come from, you want to
tttsnatch the goodies, you got to at
tttleast talk to them first.

tTyrell and Karla go for it on the dance floor, leaving Will and Julie
talone. They look at each other. They look at everyone dancing.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttHow about a drink?

tWill is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar. Julie seems to be
trelaxing, having a good time. Then, she looks up into the balcony and
tsees, in a strobe light's FLASH --

<b>tSOMEONE IN A SLICKER
</b>
twatching her intently. She squints for a better look, but he's gone.

<b>tttttWILL
</b>tttt(yelling over the din)
tttYou okay?

tShe's chalk white and crestfallen. Her whole affect is "Will I ever
thave a normal time?" She drifts amay toward the stairs to the balcony.

tttttWILL (cont'd)
tttHey Julie?

tWill catches Karla and Tyrell's eyes. They're worried.

<b>7BtINT. THE CLUB - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</b>
tJulie catches another glimps of THE SLICKER.

tShe pushes her way through the crowd up the stairs.

<b>7CtINT. THE CLUB - BALCONY - NIGHT
</b>
tJulie looks all around -- finally spotting the MAN IN THE SLICKER from
tbehind, making his way to the other side.

tHe slices through a crowd of students, and Julie keeps following. He
tturns down a service corridor.

tJulie follows, frightened, but unable to resist.

tShe catches him at the end of the corridor. She reaches out and grabs
tthe stranger's arm.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttBen...

tThe stranger turns around. It's only a club kid in a tacky vinyl
traincoat and hat. She's shaken.

<b>tttttSLICKER GUY
</b>tttHye, baby. You following me up
ttthere?
tttt(a come-on)
tttWell, all right.

tJulie turns away and hurries down the hallway. Todd follows, but his
tfigure quickly fades.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>8tINT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
tWith morning sun filtering through her blinds, Julie wakes up to the
tstrange sound of THUMPING. She gets out of bed and slowly exits the
troom.

<b>8AtINT. JULIE'S HALLWAY TO KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
tThe noise gets louder as she heads down the hall.

<b>tANGLE ON A CLOSET
</b>
tThe noise is at its loudest -- Julie reaches for a doorknob -- and
tyanks open the door.

<b>tANGLE ON A CLOTHES DRYER
</b>
trocking and banging inside the closet. Julie frowns.

tJulie spins, once again startled by Karla, who crosses to the dryer,
tflipping open the lid and then jumping back to catch the shoes as they
tpop out on the fly.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttt(still sleepy)
tttThat could break the machine.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttJulie, people who end up making
tttrules like that end up beating
ttttheir kids with wire hangers. It's
ttta fact.

tThe phone RINGS. Karla looks at her watch.

tttttKARLA (cont'd)
tttIt's Tyrell.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttt(resigned)
tttThe number's unlisted...

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttWould you relax? We've been dating
tttthree months. He ain't stalking

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttOkay, okay. You're right.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttI know it, and it feels good.
tttt(answering the phone)
tttHi, Ty.

tA DJ for a local radio station BOOMS from the phone.

<b>tttttMARK (V.O.)
</b>tttThis is Mark in the Morning for

tJulie watches her friend get excited.

</b>tttMark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh

tttt(to Julie)
tttJules, it's Mark in the Morning.

<b>tttttKARLA

</b>tttHow'd you like to win a Magic 96.7
tttQuicky Getaway?

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttYes!

tJulie hits the SPEAKERPHONE BUTTON and Karla hangs up. The DJ's voice
techos through the appartment.

<b>tttttMARK (V.O.)
</b>tttGood, then I hope you remember your
tttgeography, Karla, because all you
ttthave to do to win is tell me the

tKarla's smile abruptly fades.

<b>tttttKARLA
</b>tttt(into phone)
tttBrazil? Um...

tShe looks to Julie, whose face is as blank as hers.

tttttKARLA (cont'd)
tttYou don't know?! You have to know.
tttYou know everything...

</b>tttC'mon, Karla, one easy question,

tttYou mean Brazil, the country?

<b>tttttMARK (V.O.)
</b>tttOkay, Karla, five seconds.
tttt(counting down)
tttFive...Four...

tJulie has an idea. She scramles for the kitchen. Grabs a BAG OF FRESH-
tGROUND COFFEE from the FREEZER.

tttttMARK (cont'd, V.O.)
tttThree...Two...

tJulie tosses the bag across the room to Karla. Karla reads the label:

tttJulie, I love you. I know I'm only a

</b>tttStupid. Stupid.

</b>tttStupid. What were you thinkng?

tRay looks at Dave a contemplative beat, then walks over to his truck.
tHe leans in the passenger side and pulls out the engagement ring box.
tDave walks over.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttYou wanna see what I've been

tHe holds up the box and slowly opens it. Dave is stunned.

</b>tttI should go up there. I should call

</b>
tThe music's even LOUDER in here. The mood is high...Two buddies going
tto propose to a girl. Dave adjusts the radio to another AM station --

</b>tttMan, I love AM radio. You got
tttright-wing conspiracy, tips for
tttpregnant womem, Single-A baseball
tttgames, and real country music...
tttNone of that new crap...

tHe adjusts the dial again, tuning in a country song, "MAMAS, DON'T LET
tYOUR BABIES GROW UP TO BE COWBOYS," by Waylon Jennings and Willie
tNelson.

tDave starts singing along, extra LOUD and out of tune.

tttttDAVE (cont'd)
tttt(singing)
ttt"...Mamas, don't let your babies grow

tRay looks at his goofy friend singing and starts to get a little happy
thimself...

tThen, Ray sees something in the road ahead. He turns down the radio.
tThey both stare --

tRay slows and creeps past the car. The driver's door is open. It

</b>ttt...Dave?

tThere's no answer from dead Dave. Ray tries to see around the

tThe BRIGHTS and FOGS come on, blinding Ray. The truck's engine REVS.
tThe truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on Ray.

tThen, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at Ray.

tRay runs at the truck. AT THE LAST MINUTE, he ducks behind the parked
tcar.

tHIS TRUCK goes SCREAMING past.

tRay backs around the car --

</b>
tgoes barreling by in the other direction. Ray dives out of the way.

<b>tIN THE ROAD
</b>
tRay is exposed. He sees his truck closing fast. He's got nowhere to
tgo. Then, at the very last second,

</b>
tjumps off the edge of the road. His TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE BARRIER RIGHT

</b>
tRay falls through the air. Lands hard on his leg. Tumbles down the

tttSong number thirty-nine.

tTyrell nods and punches a few buttons. Julie takes the stage as sappy

tHe picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a Sunfish

tJulie keeps walking. She sees historical pictures of the hotel: work
tcrews during construction; the first limbo contest; fishermen standing
tnext to sailfish and marlin.

tNear the pictures, Julie sees the globe. It's spinning slowly.

tIt's windy, dark, and spooky. The kind of place you'd take people if
tyou wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story. That is just what
tEstes is doing.

tgrabs for her arm.

tRay pilots the boat through the dark, choppy water. He's navigating by

</b>
tdrifting on the fast sea. The words "Tower Bay" are painted on the

tof Ben's boots.

tBen hits the ladder --

tJust as Julie reaches the top rung she SCREAMS --

</b>
tNancy appears in the opening and throws a brick down at Ben. It hits

tJulie makes it into the attic. They pull the ladder up behind them
tlike a drawbridge.

</b>tttWhat do we do?

tFrom below comes LAUGHTER. There's a tug on the hatch, cracking it

tThere's more tugging, the hatch bending down; they can see Ben. Then,
tthe rope SNAPS. The hatch slams shut.

</b>tttThere's no way to grip this thing.

tSuddenly the STEEL TIP of the HOOK pokes through the crack...It

tJulie, Karla, and Nancy move toward the cathedral window. They turn.
tThey are cut off. They spread out against the wall looking for an
topening to get back to the hatch.

tBen feints toward Nancy then swipes at Julie --

tHe misses. She leaps away. She looks down. Instead of insulation, she
tsees a

tShe sees her bed through a one-way mirror. Julie stares, momentarily

tKarla keeps a wary eye on Ben as she gingerly backs up on the glass.

tKarla leans away from the attack and loses her balance, slipping onto

tEstablish. The sun setting over a quaint street in a college town.

<b>tSUPERTITLE:tttFOUR MONTHS LATER
</b>
tJulie pedals her bicycle down the street. She has a book bag over her
tshoulder. It feels like one of the first days of school.

tShe rides the bike up to a small house on the perfect street. She
trolls the bike right up to the front door.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>107tINT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tJulie lets herself into the house. She leans her bike against another
tbike in the hallway.

tIt's a perfect day. Birds CHIRPING. WIND in the willows. There's
tanother NOISE...from inside her house.

tShe goes perfectly still. And listens. Behind her, by the kitchen, the
tshadow of a FIGURE moves. She whirls.

<b>tNOTHING
</b>
tShe creeps down the hallway toward her kitchen. She pauses --

tThe dark figure almost knocks into her. She SCREAMS.

tIt's Ray. He's holding a disemboweled toaster.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttRay...what are you doing?

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttt(toaster)
tttOh...it's not working right.
tttYou're home early.
tttt(sees she's shaken)
tttDid I scare you?

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttNever do that again.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttt(tender)
tttHey -- I didn't know you were here.
tttIt's okay.
tttt(beat)
tttWe got the refrigerator in. Come
tttsee.

tShe sees the love in his eyes. She hugs him.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttI love it here.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttIt's gonna be great.

<b>107AtINT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tJulie climbs to the top of the stairs. She passes Ray in the bathroom.
tShe pauses in the doorway --

<b>107BtINT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tRay is at the sink in boxer shorts. He's using an electric Waterpic
tdevicice that has just been opened, a gift from the party. It makes a
tlow WHIRRING sound.

<b>tttttRAY
</b>tttt(seeing her)
tttChecking the locks again?

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttYou know me to well.

tJulie smile and walks to the bedroom.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>107CtINT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tJulie climbs into bed with a book. The bedroom is clean and orderly.
tThe windows are closed. The closet door is shut.

tThe room is decorated simply: a high antique bed; unopened boxes; a
thighboy; an antique mirror leaning against the wall. A stuffed bear
tsits in a chair.

tThere is a CLATTER from another room. Julie freezes. She waits. She
thears it again. She climbs out of bed.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>107DtINT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tJulie walks into the dark spare bedroom. The CLATTERING SOUND comes
tfrom the open window. The wind is blowing the blinds.

tJulie relaxes. She shuts the window. As she leaves the room, we notice
tthe dirty imprint of a boot below the window.

<b>107EtINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tJulie passes Ray who is still absorbed with the new toy.

tBehind him, the door softly closes. The lock twists. Ray is oblivious,
thappy being the dental-hygene pacesetter of the household.

<b>107FtINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tJulie enters the room. She looks at the closet door. It is open a
tcrack. She hesitates, trying to remember if it was open before -- it
twasn't.

tJulie approaches the closet. She catches her refelction in the mirror
tnext to the closet. She peers into the crack of the closet. She can't
tsee anything. She throws open the closet door.

<b>tNOTHING
</b>
tShe looks around the room.

<b>tttttJULIE
</b>tttWhat is my problem?

tShe sits down on the bed.

tWe see her bare feet from under the bed.

tShe smiles, relaxes. She looks in the mirror leaning against the wall.
tSomething has caught her eye. She freezes. She turns slowly back to
tthe reflection in the mirror. She sees the glint of steel --

<b>tA HOOK -- CRASH ZOOM INTO REFLECTION --
</b>
<b>tTHE FISHERMAN CROUCHING UNDER HER BED
</b>
tJulie turns too late --

tThe fisherman lunges out and grabs her legs. Julie screams. She goes
tdown --

tHer nails scrape into the wooden floor as she is dragged under the
tbed.
