tOne small step for man, one large pile of garbage for moon-
tkind.  Untouched for years, the flag stands next to the
tcastoff remains of the Apollo mission.  Slowly the discarded
tequipment begins to RATTLE and SHAKE.

tAN ENORMOUS SHADOW creeps towards us blotting out the horizon,
ta loud RUMBLE is heard.

tSuddenly we are covered in DARKNESS as the SHADOW engulfs us.
tOnly the lonely image of our EARTH hangs in the air, until a
thuge silhouetted OBJECT suddenly blocks our view.

tA lone TECHNICIAN works on his putting skills.  Behind him,
twall to wall technical equipment quietly sifts through data.
tA RED LIGHT begins to flash.

tThe Technician turns and slowly walks towards the source.  One
tby one a series of LIGHTS turn on.  The Technician (TECH ONE)

tsomething.

</b>ttLet's not jump the gun.  Run a

tThey arrive at a glass table.  The surrounding officers snap
tto attention as a SECOND OFFICER quickly brings over a large
ttransparency.  We SEE a grainy image of a large vague OBJECT.

</b>ttLooks like a big turd.

tThe two Officers exchange a glance.

<b>ttttCOMMANDING OFFICER
</b>ttWe estimate it has a diameter of

tSleeping next to him, his six-year-old daughter, PATRICIA.

</b>ttt(filtered)
ttYou didn't let her stay up

<b>tT.V. - NEWS PROGRAM
</b>
tSeveral &quot;Pundits&quot; sit around a MaLaughlin-type news discussion
tprogram.  The picture quality is snowy, static ridden.

<b>ttttPUNDIT #1
</b>tt... the inexperience in public
ttoffice was inevitably going to
ttcatch up with him.  He's
ttscarified his ideals for
tt&quot;politics as usual.&quot;

tWhitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality.

<b>ttttPUNDIT #2
</b>tt...I said this during the
ttcampaign.  Leadership as a pilot

tbench.

<b>ttttSECURITY GUARD
</b>ttGood morning, Mr. President.

<b>ttttWHITMORE
</b>ttGood morning, George.

tThe paper is dropped revealing CONSTANCE HALBROOK, mid-
tthirties, aggressive, sharp, the President's communications
tdirector.  Quickly she gathers her things and follows
tWhitmore.

tTwo servants are preparing breakfast as Whitmore and Constance

</b>ttYou're up early this morning,
ttConnie.

tShe tosses him one of the many newspapers in her hands.

<b>ttttCONSTANCE
</b>ttThey're not attacking your

ttseems less like the President and

ttmore.'&quot;

<b>ttttWHITMORE
</b>ttClever.

<b>ttttCONSTANCE
</b>ttAge was never an issue when you
ttstuck to your gun.  You were

</b>ttt(pointedly)
ttIsn't it amazing how fast everyone
ttcan turn against you.

tRealizing she may be pushing him too far, she hands him
tanother paper.

<b>tAN OLD RUSSIAN SATELLITE
</b>
tDrifting away from us the old Russian satellite becomes
tsmaller and smaller.  We PAN with it as we SEE it's on a
tcollision course with something huge.

tSuddenly the satellite EXPLODES on IMPACT with the much larger
tobject that dwarfs the puny piece of hardware.  As huge as it
tis, we get the feeling we've only seen a portion of the total.

tWith the New York skyline across the Hudson behind them, old

<b>ttttMOISHE
</b>ttWhat are you waiting?  My social

ttbe sitting there.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI'm thinking.

<b>ttttMOISHE
</b>ttSo think already.

tDavid makes a move.  Instantly Moishe counters his move.
tDavid furls his brow in thought.

<b>ttttMOISHE
</b>ttAgain he's thinking.

tMoishe reaches into a paper bag and retrieves a coffee in a
tStyrofoam cup.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttYou have any idea how long it
tttakes for those things to
ttdecompose?

<b>ttttMOISHE
</b>ttYou don't move soon.  I'll begin to
ttdecompose.

tJust as David finally makes his move, Moishe counters again.
tDavid shoots him a look and stares back down to the board.

ttttMOISHE (cont'd)
ttDavid, I've been meaning to talk
ttwith you.  It's nice you've been
ttspending so much time with me,
ttbut...

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttDad, don't start.

<b>ttttMOISHE
</b>ttI'm only saying, it's been what?
ttFour years, you still haven't
ttsigned your divorce papers.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttThree years.

<b>ttttMOISHE
</b>ttThree, four.  Move on.  It's not
tthealthy.

tMoishe takes a big puff on the cigar and coughs.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttLook who's talking healthy.

tSuddenly David's beeper goes off.

<b>ttttMOISHE
</b>ttHow many times is that now?  You
tt<u>trying</u> to get fired?

tDavid moves his queen.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttCheckmate.  See you tomorrow, Dad.

tHe gives his father a quick kiss and hurries away.

tDavid pedals his bike through mid-town Manhattan.  He arrives

<b>tINT. COMPACT CABLE OFFICES - LATER
</b>
tHis bike hoisted on his shoulder, David squeezes through the
trevolving doors. MARTY GILBERT, short, nervous and harried,
tcomes rushing over.

<b>ttttMARTY
</b>ttWhat the hell is the point of
tthaving a beeper if you don't turn
ttit on?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttIt was <u>turned</u> on.  I was ignoring
ttyou.  What's the big emergency?

<b>ttttMARTY
</b>ttStarted this morning.  Every
ttchannel is making like it's
ttnineteen fifty.  Snow, static, all
ttkinds of distortions.  No one
ttknows what the hell is going on.

tDavid deposits his bike in the kitchenette as Marty tosses his
tcoke bottle in the trash.  David retrieves it.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttDamn it, Marty.  There's a reason
ttwe have bins labeled &quot;recycle.&quot;

tFinding more bottles in the trash, David turns to Marty
taccusingly.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWhat the hell is this?

<b>ttttMARTY
</b>ttSo sue me.

tBefore David can say anything, Marty ushers him out of the
troom.

</b>ttDid you try to switch to
tttransponder channels?

<b>ttttMARTY
</b>ttPlease, would I be this panicked
ttif it was that simple?

tDavid examines the readouts, puzzled.

</b>ttLet's retrofit the dish to another

</b>ttIt's all fuzzy.

<b>ttttMIGUEL
</b>ttYou're gonna break it.  Just leave

tHis sister, ALICIA, fourteen, hormones kicking in, testing

tA beat up pick-up truck comes down a dirt road and skids to a

tout, slamming his door.

</b>ttMorning, Lucas.

tLucas holds a bowl full of rotted vegetables.

<b>ttttLUCAS
</b>ttYou like these!  I've got a whole

tUnceremoniously, he dumps them at Miguel's feet.

ttttLUCAS (cont'd)
ttWhere the hell is your father?
ttYou know what time it is?

</b>ttWe both know what the problem is.
ttHe's a damned nut case, is what he

</b>ttAll right, Connie, we're here.
ttWhat's this all about?

<b>ttttCONSTANCE
</b>ttI really have no idea.  He just
ttsaid to bring everyone down here.

tSteve shows Dylan the alien space craft.

</b>ttDoes that thing fly in outer

tSteve loos up at the craft admiringly.

<b>ttttSTEVE
</b>ttIt certainly does.

tWhen the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks
ton the hatch door on the alien attacker.  The door swings open
tand David climbs down.

tGrabbing a coke can from the &quot;recycle&quot; trash bin, David places
tthe empty can on top of the alien attacker.  David turns and
tfaces the gathering.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttCould anyone please step back
ttaway from the craft?

tThey do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft.  The
tTechnician disappears inside, closing the door behind him.  A
tloud HUM emits from the craft.  David has to yell over it.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttLt. Mitchell, would you mind
ttdrawing your pistol?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttFrom where you're standing, do you
ttthink you could shoot that can off
ttthe alien craft?

tMitchell shrugs affirmatively.  David gestures for him to try.
tTaking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS.

tThe bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield.
tSeveral people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the
terrant bullet.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttSorry 'bout that.  You see, it's
ttprotected by the craft's shields.
ttWe can't penetrate their defenses.

<b>ttttNIMZIKI
</b>ttWe know that already.  What's your
ttpoint?

tDavid walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the
tcraft by cables and starts typing furiously.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttMy point is if we can't beat their
ttdefenses, then we must get <u>around</u>
ttthem.

tDavid stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently
tcounting down.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttLt. Mitchell, would you please try
ttto shoot it again?

tReluctantly Mitchell obliges.  This time the can is BLOWN OFF
tTHE CRAFT.  Everyone in the room is shocked.  The Technician
tre-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.

<b>ttttGENERAL GREY
</b>ttHow did you do that?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttI gave it a cold.

tThe President is fascinated, he steps closer.  Moishe beams
tproudly at his smart son.  Constance is amazed.

ttttDAVID (cont'd)
ttMore accurately, I gave it a
ttvirus.  A computer virus.

tDavid turns his laptop around for the President to see.

<b>ttttGENERAL GREY
</b>ttAre you telling us you can send
ttout a signal that will disable all
tttheir shields?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttJust as they used our satellites
ttagainst us, we can use their own
ttsignal against them.

tDavid walks over to a diagram he's made showing the
trelationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the
tsmaller alien attackers.

ttttDAVID (cont'd)
ttIf we plant the virus directly
ttinto the mother ship, it would
ttthen filter down into all the
ttcorresponding ships below.

<b>ttttNIMZIKI
</b>ttAnd just how do we infect the
tt&quot;Mother Ship&quot; with a virus?

tDavid gestures to the alien attacker behind him.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttWe'll have to fly their craft out
ttof our atmosphere and dock with
ttthe mother ship.

tIntrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker,
tsizing it up.  David points to a satellite photo of the
tunderbelly of the Mother Ship.

ttttDAVID (cont'd)
ttWe can enter here, upload the
ttvirus and set off an explosion
ttthat could disable it.  This would
ttdisorient the smaller ship below
ttand buy you some time to take them
ttout.

tConstance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.

<b>ttttNIMZIKI
</b>ttThis is ridiculous.

<b>ttttGENERAL GREY
</b>ttHow long would their shields be
ttdown?

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttOnce they discover the virus it
ttcould be a matter of minutes.

<b>ttttNIMZIKI
</b>ttYou want us to co-ordinate a
ttmassive world wide counter strike
ttwith a window of only a few
ttminutes?

<b>ttttGENERAL GREY
</b>ttWith their shields down it might
ttbe possible.

<b>ttttNIMZIKI
</b>ttPlease, you're not buying into any
ttof this nonsense, are you?  We
ttdon't have the manpower or the
ttresources to launch that kind of a

ttt(gesturing to the alien

ttNot to mention that this whole

ttis qualified to operate.

<b>ttttSTEVE (O.S.)
</b>ttI wouldn't say that, sir.

tEveryone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd.

<b>ttttSTEVE
</b>ttI've seen them in action.  I've
ttwatched their maneuvers.  With
ttyour permission, sir, I'd like the
ttopportunity to try.

</b>ttThat thing's a wreck.  It crash

ttflying.

tDavid turns to the Technicians.

<b>ttttDAVID
</b>ttRemove the clamps!

tTechnicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of
tthe craft.  With a loud CLANK, the clamps are pulled away.

tFor a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly
tstabilizes, FLOATING ABOVE THEM.

</b>ttAny other questions?

tEveryone stares at the floating ship with wonder.

tThe President whirls, grabs Nimziki and SLAMS him against the
