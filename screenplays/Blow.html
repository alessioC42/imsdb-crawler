<b>tttttttt ON BLACK:
</b>
<b>t"A MAN MUST LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND THINK LUXURY."
</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY
</b>
tA majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the
tColumbian highlands.  A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and
tthen another.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  The view changes and tiny
tdots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH.

<b>tCLOSER
</b>
tWe realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel
tmachetes in slow methodical rhythm.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  WE SEE
tthe South American Indian MEN clearly now.  Their tar stained
tteeth.  Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.  Their
tjaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect
tthe harvest.

<b>tEXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY
</b>
tOld rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized
tbales speed along the narrow road.

<b>tEXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY
</b>
tThe bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the
tleaves.  Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after
tarmload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a
tgigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire.
tThe leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke
tstreaks the sky.  Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel
tashes into the pot to cool the solution.

<b>tINT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY
</b>
tA primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the
tequipment.  The machinery.  The solutions.  The over-sized
tvats.  Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport
tautomatic weapons at all the points of entry.  The coca is
tnow a "basuco" paste and is being sent in for a wash.

<b>tINT. LABORATORY - COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY
</b>
tA conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine
thydrochloride.  The bricks are wrapped, tied up, weighed, and
tstamped with a "P" before being thrown into duffel bags.

<b>tEXT. JUNGLE AIRSTRIP - COLOMBIA - DAY
</b>
tA small twin-engine Cessna is loaded with dozens of duffel
tbags and the plane takes off.

<b>tEXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - NIGHT
</b>
tThe Cessna touches down.

<b>tEXT. WORKSITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY
</b>
tThe worksite is busy.  George is amongst other workers,
tworking a summer job.  As George is taking five, he looks
tacross the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.  A long
tway from being the boss.

<b>tINT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY
</b>
tGeorge stands in line to register for college, wearing his
tBrooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair.
tThe room is crowded and the line is long.  Bob Dylan's
t"Subterranean Homesick Blues" blares out of one of the kid's
ttransistor radios.  George looks around the room.  He is
tuncomfortable.  He catches his reflection in the shiny glass
tpartition and stops.  He doesn't like what he sees.
tSomething is not right.  He looks like everyone else.  Same
tcookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie
tcutter faces.  He's a carbon copy.

<b>ttttREGISTRATION WOMAN
</b>ttNext.

tIt's George's turn but he doesn't hear it.  "Twenty years of
tschooling and they put you on a day shift."  The words hit
thim like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own
treflection.

<b>ttttGEORGE (V.O.)
</b>ttI was standing there, and it was like
ttthe outside of me and the inside of me
ttdidn't match, you know?  And then I
ttlooked around the room and it hit me.  I
ttsaw my whole life.  Where I was gonna
ttlive, what type of car I'd drive, who my
ttneighbors would be.  I saw it all and I
ttdidn't want it.  Not that life.

<b>tEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY
</b>
tGeorge sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a
tlunch box.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttThere's something out there for me, Dad.
ttSomething different.  Something free
ttform, you know?  Something for me, and
ttcollege just isn't it.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttThat's too bad.  You would have been the
ttfirst one in the family.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttI know.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttAlright.  You want me to get your old
ttjob back?  Because I could, you know, I
ttcould put in that word.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttNo, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I
ttjust don't want...

tIt's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like
thim.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWhat are you going to do?

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttI'm going to California.

<b>tEXT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY

</b>
tGeorge and Tuna, now 21-years old, struggle with their bags.
tTheir new place is a tackily furnished, two-story apartment
twith small balconies and a view of the ocean.  As George and
tTuna struggle with the bags, two California beauties appear
ton the balcony next door: BARBARA BUCKLEY, 20, and MARIA
<b>tGONZALES, 21.
</b>
<b>ttttGIRLS
</b>ttYou guys need some help?

ttwe're gonna like it here.

<b>tEXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY
</b>
<b>tSERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
tBarbara and Maria introduce George and Tuna around to the
tManhattan Beach regulars.  They are immediately accepted
tdespite their ill fitting shorts and Tuna's unhip black
tsocks.  The beach scene is one big party.  Lots of beer,
tmusic, bikinis, and good times.  By the end of the day,
tGeorge and Tuna have a hundred new friends.

<b>ttttGEORGE (V.O.)
</b>ttCalifornia was like nothing I'd ever
ttexperienced.  The people were liberated
ttand independent and full of new ideas.

<b>ttttGEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>ttThey used words like "right on,"
tt"groovy," and "solid."  The women are

</b>ttI'm a flight attendant.

<b>ttttWOMAN #2
</b>ttI'm a flight attendant.

<b>ttttWOMAN #3
</b>ttI'm a flight attendant.

tThe weed comes out and is passed around.  Pipes.  Joints.
tBongs.  In SLOW MOTION, Barbara takes a huge hit of grass,
tgrabs George's face, french kissing him, and giving him a
thuge shotgun.

<b>tINT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY
</b>
tGeorge and Barbara are sleeping late.  Their bodies
tintertwined beneath the sheets.  A slam of the front door
twakes them up.  It's Tuna.

<b>ttttTUNA
</b>ttHey, wake up.  Come on, you two
ttlovebirds.  Hurry, I want to show you
ttsomething.

tGeorge and Barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the

</b>ttYou know how we were wondering what we

ttWell, check this out.

tTuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the
tkitchen table.  It's a grey mound of stocky, seedy marijuana.

tBarbara examines the reefer.

</b>ttTuna, this is crap.

tGeorge, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is
tCalifornia's first male hair salon.  George looks around at

tmanicures.

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttNothing like this back home.

<b>ttttBARBARA
</b>ttDerek!

tDEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate,

</b>ttEveryone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I

tAfter the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his

</b>ttWhat can I do for you guys?

tThe following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage
tstyle...

<b>ttttPROSECUTOR (CONT'D)
</b>ttMr. Jung, can you describe the
ttcircumstances of how you began talking
ttabout cocaine with Mr. Delgado?

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttShortly after I arrived at Danbury
ttFederal Correctional Institute I related
ttto Diego that the crime I was in for was
ttsmuggling marijuana.
ttDiego told me he had high level
ttconnections in Colombia and they needed
ttto find someone to help them transport
ttcocaine into America...

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttThe first run was fifteen kilos, which
ttwe smuggled into Logan Airport in hard
ttshelled suitcases.

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe wrapped the cocaine in kitchen
ttcabinet paper, and duct tape, that way
ttif there were any dogs in customs...

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttI introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack
ttStevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of
ttcocaine per week into the United States
ttvia twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly
ttinto North Carolina, we'd meet him there
ttand drive it down to different
ttdistribution points...

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttI never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego
ttDelgado was my only connection to
ttcocaine from Colombia...

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttDiego convinced me to keep most of my
ttmoney in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a
ttclose relationship with Manuel Noriega.
ttIn exchange for allowing us to keep our
ttmoney there, we paid him a percentage.

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttThere was an 85% chance that if you
ttsnorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it
ttwas ours. Initially with my LA
ttconnections, we invented the
ttmarketplace.  In 1977, there was no
ttother real competition.

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttThe first year we made about 100 million
ttdollars between us.  It was an expensive
ttoperation.  Eventually we built up to
ttthree different pilots doing multiple
ttruns per week, connections on both
ttcoasts, everything was running smooth.
ttWe were like a corporation...

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>tthe was very anti-government.  He talked
ttabout revolution, forming his own
ttcountry or island, he was looking for
ttpower as well as money.  I was just
ttlooking for money.

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttHe disliked the United States, thought
ttit was a police state.  He hoped that by
ttflooding the country with cocaine, it
ttwould disrupt the political system and
tttear down the morality of the country.

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttWell, yes, Derek Foreal was my
ttconnection, I met him back in 1968 when
ttI first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It
ttwas Foreal's marijuana connections that
ttkicked off our cocaine market.

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttYes, it was my idea to bring the kilos
ttto Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got
ttDerek Foreal's name from me, it was only
tta matter of months before he'd cut me
ttout.

<b>ttttGEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>ttI'm not sure how my relationship with my
ttdaughter and ex-wife have anything to do
ttwith this trial.  I mean we're here to
tttalk about Diego Delgado, aren't we?

<b>ttttCALIBANOS
</b>ttYes, we are Mr. Jung.

tDelgado, Joe Calibanos, a sleazy-Greek-like-ex-basketball
tweight lifter guy is now doing the questioning.

<b>ttttCALIBANOS (CONT'D)
</b>ttMr. Jung, you're a convicted felon,
ttcorrect?

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttYes, I am.

<b>ttttCALIBANOS
</b>ttDo you have any agreement or
ttunderstanding whatsoever with the United
ttStates government in regards to your
tttestimony?

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttNo, I cam here out of my own volition.

<b>ttttCALIBANOS
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttSomething about vengance being best

<b>ttttCALIBANOS

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttCALIBANOS
</b>ttMr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or
ttunderstanding with the United States
ttGovernment in connection with your
tttestimony in this case?

<b>ttttGEORGE
</b>ttI'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no
ttchance of parole.  Even if they cut my
ttsentence in half I'll be seventy-three
ttyears old.  That's some fucking deal.  I
ttdon't know if the parole board, the
ttjudge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself
ttcan get me out of here.  I have a really
ttbad record, I'm not sure what's going to
tthappen.

<b>ttttCALIBANOS
</b>ttSo you do have an agreement with the
ttUnited States Government, Mr. Jung,
ttcorrect?

tGeorge can't respond.  Looks to Diego.  Looks from the jury,
tthe judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable.
tHe feels suddenly sleazy.

<b>ttttCALIBANOS (CONT'D)
</b>ttI thought so.  No more questions.

tSilence.  The judge tells George he can step down.  Calibanos
