tA white on black TITLE appears in the lower left hand corner
tof the screen:

<b>tAUGUST, 1936
</b>
<b>ttttttttFADE OUT.
</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. A SLUM AREA OF JOLIET - DAY
</b>
tIt's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the
tstreets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters),
tand the point-men for juvenile gangs.  We pick up a solitary
tfigure, Joe Mottola, coming down the street and entering
twhat appears to be an abandoned tenement.  He pauses a
tsecond to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back
tof his pants leg.  Sharply dressed and surrounded by the
taura of one who is making money for the first time and
tbroadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in
tthis part of town.

tWe follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second
tfloor flat.  He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious
tdoorman.

<b>tINT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY
</b>
tSuddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring
tpeople.  This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place
timmune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on
ta number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600
tto 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right.  The
tbettors are queued up in several lines before a long table,
twhere they place their bets and are given receipts in return.
tOthers wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous
tearnings or to ask for credit.

tMottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting
tslips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful
tand somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man
tnamed Mr. Granger.  The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on
tthe radio in the background.

tMottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little
tinterest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a
tlittle pinch on the cheek.  The girl slaps his hand away,
tobviously having been through this before.

<b>tttttPHONE GIRL
</b>tttBeat it, Mottola.

tGranger glances up and exchanges a token nod with Mottola,
twho plops down in a folding chair next to the radio.  The
tphone rings.

<b>tttttPHONE GIRL
</b>ttt8720...Yes, hold on a second.
tttt(calling over to the Supervisor)
tttMr. Granger, Chicago on the line.


tGranger is a little apprehensive about talking to Chicago,
tbut takes the phone anyway.

<b>tttttGRANGER
</b>tttYeh?

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. A WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - CHICAGO - DAY
</b>
tA flabby, bald man named Combs is on the other end of the
tline.  Visible beyond the door and interior window of his
toffice is a large room, cluttered with tables, typewriters,
tclerks and adding machines.  This room is the clearinghouse
tfor all the transaction of the numbers game.  All the
tbetting slips and income from the spots are brought in here
tand processed.

<b>tttttCOMBS
</b>tttGranger, this is Combs.  Why
ttthaven't we heard from ya?  Everybody
tttelse is in.

<b>tttttGRANGER
</b>tttWe had a few problems with the Law
tttthis morning.  The Mayor promised
tttthe Jaycees to get tough on the
tttrackets again, so he shut everybody
tttdown for a couple hours to make it
tttlook good.  Nothing serious, it
tttjust put us a little behind for the
tttday.

<b>tttttCOMBS
</b>tttYou been making your payoffs,
ttthaven't ya?

<b>tttttGRANGER
</b>tttHell yes.  He does this every year.
tttThere's nothing to worry about.

<b>tttttCOMBS
</b>tttOkay, finish your count and get it
tttup here as soon as you can.  I
tttdon't wanta be here all night.

<b>tttttGRANGER
</b>tttBelieve me, the Man's gonna be real
ttthappy.  Looks like we cleared over
tttten grand this week.

<b>tttttCOMBS
</b>tttt(not impressed)
tttWe cleared 22 here.

<b>tttttGRANGER
</b>tttWell, hell, you got the whole
tttChicago south side.  How do ya
tttexpect the eight lousy spots I've
tttgot to compete with that?

<b>tttttCOMBS
</b>tttt(reading off a sheet
ttttof paper on his desk)
tttThey did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5
tttis Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks
tttlike you're bringing up the rear,
tttGranger.

<b>tINT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY
</b>
tGranger burns inside.  One of the girls who's been sorting
tand counting hands him a slip of paper.

<b>tttttGRANGER
</b>tttI just got the count.  We'll put
tttthe take on the 4:15.

<b>tttttCOMBS
</b>tttWe'll be waitin'.

tCombs hangs up, smiling to himself, proud of the way he gave
tthe needle to Granger.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY
</b>
tGranger storming over to a safe and jerking open the door.

<b>tttttGRANGER
</b>tttt(snapping)
tttMottola.

tMottola hustles out of his chair.

<b>tttttGRANGER
</b>tttt(handing him a bundle
ttttof bills)
tttTake this up to the city on the
ttt4:15.  They'll be waitin' for it at
tttthe clearing house.  And don't stop
tttfor no drinks.  You can get a cab
tttdown the street.

tMottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat
tpocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky.  No
tone would ever guess that he was just an overdressed
tmessenger boy.

<b>tEXT. OF THE TENEMENT AGAIN
</b>
tMottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley.
tHe walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large
talleyway; this one connecting two streets.  The alley is
tdeserted save for one scruffy, slovenly dressed young
tstranger coming toward him from the opposite direction.  The
tman carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry.

tSuddenly, Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere
tbehind him.  He turns around to see a small, weathered
tlooking thief come racing around the corner and down the
talley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray-haired black
tman.  Limping noticeably, the black man manages a few cries
tfor help and then stumbles and falls.  The stranger yells at
tMottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies
thimself for the arrival of the thief.  Mottola just stands
tthere, not the least interested in the exercise of justice.
tJust as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws
this suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling
tand separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his
tleft hand.

tThe stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back
tto where Mottola is standing.  Almost by reflex, Mottola
tpicks it up.  The thief scrambles to his feet and starts
tback toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife.  Both
tthe stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack.
tThe thief, realizing that there are two people to fight,
tbegins to think better of it.  He is not a young man, nor
tparticularly strong.

<b>tttttTHIEF
</b>tttt(shaking his fist at
ttttthe stranger)
tttYou fuckin' nigger-lover.  I'll get
tttyou for this someday, sucker egg.

tMottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the
tthief flees out onto the street and disappears.

tThe black man, meanwhile, has struggled to his feet and is
tstaggering toward them.  He collapses against the alley wall
tafter a few steps.  The stranger rushes over to him, followed
tsomewhat absently by Mottola.

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttThe wallet.  You gotta go after him.
tttHe's got all the money.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttDon't worry, we got the wallet.
tttWhat happened?  He get ya with the
tttknife?

tThe stranger opens the Black Man's coat to reveal a bloody
twound at the top of his leg.

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttt(trying to move)
tttGive it to me!  Please.  I gotta
tttknow it's all there!

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttYou just sit tight, old man.  We're
tttgonna have to get you to a doctor.
tttt(starting to leave)
tttI'll call a cop.

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttNo, no cops!

tMottola has given him his wallet, which the black man now
topens, disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber
tband.  Mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of
tmoney.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttt(a little uneasy)
tttYou wanted by the law or somethin'?

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttNaw, it's okay.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttYou're crazy carryin' that kinda
tttmoney in this neighborhood.  No
tttwonder you got hit.

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttt(trying to get to his feet)
tttThanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I
tttgotta get goin'.
tttt(his leg gives way
ttttunder him)

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttYou ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttI gotta!  Look, I run some slots
tttdown in West Bend for a mob here.
tttI got a little behind on my payoffs
tttso they figure I been holdin' out
ttton 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to
tttcome up with the cash.  I don't get
tttit there I'm dead.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttIt don't look good, gramps, it's
tttten of now.

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttI got a hundred bucks for you and
tttyour friend if you deliver the
tttmoney for me.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttt(hesitates)
tttI dunno.  That little mug that got
tttya is mad enough at me already --
tttwhat if he's out there waitin'
tttaround a corner with some friends.

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttHe won't know you're carryin' it.
tttC'mon, you gotta help me out.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttt(makes up his mind)
tttSorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call
tttyou a doc, but I ain't gonna walk
tttinto a bunch of knives for ya.

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttt(desperate to Mottola)
tttHow bout you?  I'll give you the
tttwhole hundred!

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttWhat makes you think you can trust
ttthim?  He didn't do shit.

<b>tttttMOTTOLA
</b>tttHey, butt out, chicken liver.  I
tttgave him back his wallet, didn't I?
tttt(to black man)
tttHow far is this place?

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>ttt1811 Mason.  Put it in Box 3C.  You
tttwon't have no trouble.  There's
tttfive thousand dollars there and
ttthere's a hundred for you.

<b>tttttMOTTOLA
</b>tttt(taking the bundle of
ttttbills from the black
ttttman, plus the $100 bill)
tttAll right.  I'll make your drop for
tttyou, old man.  And don't worry, you
tttcan trust me.

tMottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket, right next
tto the numbers money.  The stranger, who has now finished
tbandaging, watches him do it.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttIf that punk and his pals decide to
tttsearch ya, you'll never fool 'em
tttcarryin' it there.

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttt(suddenly afraid again)
tttWhat do we do?

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttYou got a bag or somethin?

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttNo.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttHow 'bout a handkerchief?

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttHere.

tThe stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a
twrinkled handkerchief.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttLet me have the money.

tMottola takes out the Black Man's five grand and hands it to
tthe Stranger.  He puts it in the handkerchief.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttYou better stick that other in here
ttttoo, if you wanta keep it.
<b>t
</b>

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttt(pleading)
tttJust hurry, will ya.

tMottola pulls out the numbers money and puts it in the
thandkerchief too.  The stranger ties it all up.

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttt(demonstrating by
ttttslipping the bundle
ttttdown into crotch)
tttAll right.  Carry it down in your
tttpants here.
tttt(pulling it back out
ttttand tucking it in
ttttMottola's pants)
tttAin't no hard guy in the world
tttgonna frisk ya there.

<b>tttttMOTTOLA
</b>tttThanks.
tttt(to the black man)
tttSo long, partner.  Don't worry,
ttteverything's gonna be all right.

tThe Black Man nods gratefully, but there's still a trace of
tworry on his face.  Mottola trots off down the alley and out
tonto the street, glancing around cautiously for signs of
ttrouble.  He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the
tcab stand in the distance.  Suddenly the little man with the
tknife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him.
tMottola notices him and quickens his pace, finally breaking
tinto a dead run.

tWe follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening
ta big lead on the guy with the knife.  He reaches the taxi
tzone.  He hops in a cab and slams the door.

<b>tINT. TAXI - DAY
</b>
tHe jumps in, closes the door, and breathes a sigh of relief.

<b>tttttCABBIE
</b>tttWhere to?

<b>tttttMOTTOLA
</b>tttWhich way is Mason?

<b>tttttCABBIE
</b>tttAbout 20 blocks south.

<b>tttttMOTTOLA
</b>tttOkay, go north.  The Joliet
tttStation -- Fast.
<b>t
</b>

Mottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh.

<b>tttttCABBIE
</b>tttWhat's so funny?

<b>tttttMOTTOLA
</b>tttI just made the world's easiest
tttfive grand.

tHe takes the bundle out from inside his pants in order to
tgaze upon his new-found fortune.  He unties the handkerchief.
tIt's full of toilet paper.  Mottola looks like he's just
tbeen shot.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. ALLEY - DAY - THE STRANGER AND BLACK MAN
</b>
thightailing it down the street, two newly solvent con
tartists on the lam.  It's hard to run they're laughing so
thard.  The stranger chucks his suitcase in a trash can and
tpulls the real handkerchief out of his pants.

<b>tttttBLACK MAN
</b>tttJesus, what a bundle.  Did you know
ttthe was that loaded?

<b>tttttSTRANGER
</b>tttHell no, I just cut into him.  I
tttwoulda settled for pawning one of
tttthem shoes.

tAs they split off, music begins, and we go into a

<b>tTITLES SEQUENCE
</b>
tDone to a driving Chicago blues, the sequence is designed to
testablish somewhat the milieu of the stranger, known to
tfriends and enemies alike as Hooker.  We see the following:

<b>tEXT. PAWNSHOP - LOOKING INSIDE - DAY
</b>
tHooker is getting a radio and well-worn suit out of hook.
tIt's like seeing old friends again.  All pantomime.

<b>tINT. HOOKER'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
tA shabby little place he rents above a cigar store.  We pick
thim up in a jerry-built outdoor shower, which he's rigged up
ton the fire escape.  The rinse water drips down through the
tlanding into the grimy alley below.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(singing)
ttt'With plenty of money and you-oo-
tttoo,
tttOh baby, what I wouldn't do-oo-
tttoo...'

<b>tON THE STREET AGAIN
</b>
tjauntily carrying a magnum of champagne and some flowers,
tobviously on his way to see someone special.

<b>tIN A BURLESQUE HOUSE
</b>
tHooker stands in the wings holding the flowers and champagne,
twatching his date for the evening, a 6'3" stripper named
tCrystal, do her routine.

tCrystal finishes up and comes off the stage.

<b>tttttCRYSTAL
</b>tttt(tired)
tttHi, Hooker, you gettin' married or
tttsomethin'?

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttCome into a little dough.  You
tttwanna get outa here tonight?

<b>tttttCRYSTAL
</b>tttCan't.  I got a 10 o'clock show.  I
tttneed the five bucks.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI'll spend fifty on ya.

tCrystal looks at him a second and starts to giggle.  We're
tpretty sure she's gonna get outa here tonight.

<b>tCOMING INTO A POOR MAN'S GAMBLING JOINT
</b>
tLittle more than a reconverted brick basement, the place
tcontains three shoddy, homemade roulette tables.  Hooker,
taccompanied now by Crystal, nods a greeting to the doorman
tand proceeds to a table where there are already several
tother people laying their bets for the next spin.  Hooker
tknows the wheel man, an old-timer named Jimmy.

<b>tttttJIMMY
</b>tttt(glad to see him)
tttHooker!

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttHow ya doin', Jimmy.
<b>t
</b>

<b>tttttJIMMY
</b>tttt(collecting bets and
ttttpaying off the winners)
tttAin't seen you in months, boy.
tttThought maybe you took a fall.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttNaw, just a little hard times,
tttthat's all.  It's all over now.

<b>tttttJIMMY
</b>tttYou gonna have a go here?
tttt(pointing to the
ttttbetting board)
tttHow 'bout a ten spot on the line
ttthere.  The 4-9 been lookin' good
ttttoday.  Lotsa action on 28th Street
tttdown there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.

tAs Jimmy finishes his spiel, he starts the wheel spinning
tand drops in the ball.  Betting is allowed to continue until
tthe ball drops from the outer ring into the center.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(taking out his wallet)
tttThree grand on the black.

tJimmy is stunned.  The others at the table, used to dollar
tbets, look at Hooker like he's some kind of foreign dignitary.

<b>tttttJIMMY
</b>tttt(worried)
tttYou sure you wanna start off that
tttbig?  Bet like that could put a
tttreal dent in us.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI feel lucky tonight.

<b>tttttJIMMY
</b>tttAw, come on, Hooker, why don't you
tttjust...

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttThree grand on the black, Jimmy.

tJimmy wants to argue some more, but the ball is getting
tready to drop into the center.  We see Jimmy quickly press a
thidden lever under the table with his foot.  The ball falls
tand settles into red 27 with a motion that is not quite
tright.  The others at the table fail to notice, but Hooker
tis not fooled.  He stares venomously at Jimmy, who knows
tthat Hooker is on to him.

<b>tttttJIMMY
</b>tttSorry, Hooker.
tttt(making an attempt at
ttttlevity, in order to explain)
tttGood thing that ball came up red.
tttGuy could get in trouble around
ttthere, losin' a bet that big.

tJimmy reaches for Hooker's money.  Hooker stops him by
tputting his hand on it.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttSpin it again.

tJimmy doesn't know what the hell to do.  He gives Hooker a
tlittle head motion to indicate a small window high up in one
tof the walls.  Behind it, we see a pair of eyes.  Suddenly,
tHooker understands why Jimmy had to cheat him, but it
tdoesn't change his demand.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttSpin it anyway, Jimmy.

tJimmy is beside himself.  If he doesn't spin again, Hooker
tmay expose him.  If he does spin, and loses, his management
twill fire him.  He pleads to Hooker with his eyes, but it's
tno use.  Jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the
tball.  This time there is no foot on the lever, and it
tsettles into black 15.  Hooker stares at the ball a second
tand then looks up at his terrified friend.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttDon't worry, pal.  I knew it was my
tttnight.

tHooker pushes the money over to Jimmy and walks out of the
troom.  He's lost $3,000, but he's still working on a lucky
tnight.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

</b>
tHooker and Crystal out on the street.

<b>tttttCRYSTAL
</b>tttt(irritated)
tttThanks for the evening, Hooker.  I
tttcan still make the 10 o'clock.  If
tttyou wanna spend 50 bucks on me
tttagain, mail it.

tShe walks off down the street.

<b>tttttHOOKER

tttAw, the hell with ya.

<b>tEXT. THE WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
tA late model Ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front
tof the plant.  Out bursts a carefully-groomed, tight-lipped
tyoung man named Greer, who hustles into the plant.  We
tfollow him through a maze of machinery to the service
televator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves
tin the clearinghouse room we saw earlier.

<b>tINT. PLANT - AFTERNOON - LATE

tThe working day is over now, and everyone has gone, except
tfor Combs, who sits somberly in his office.

tCombs sits in quiet thought for a second.  Finally:

tttt(pause)
tttI gotta pretty good idea, though.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. AN EXCLUSIVE NEW YORK GAMBLING CLUB - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
tAn agitated young man, Floyd, weaves his way through the
tcraps and roulette tables, and hustles up a staircase to a
tsecond floor room with a drawing of a snarling tiger on the
tdoor.  Below the tiger, the word "FARO" appears.  There is a
tlarge man, of thuggish demeanor, guarding the door, but
tFloyd gives him a small hand signal and walks right by him.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINSIDE THE FARO ROOM
</b>
tIn the center is a beautifully-carved wooden table, on which
tsit a faro board and a dealing box, tended by a stone-faced
tDealer, who calls the progress of the game in a continuous
tabacus-like device that keeps track of the cards which have
talready been played.  On the opposite side of the table,
tcompletely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards
tfrom the dealing box, sits Doyle Lonnegan.  Although is
tclothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man, there is
ta coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak
tlower class origins, for which he now has nothing but
tcontempt.

tFloyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously, trying
thard to make as little noise as possible.

<b>tttttFLOYD
</b>tttDoyle, can I see you a minute?

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttt(not looking up from
ttttthe table)
tttI'm busy, Floyd.

<b>tttttFLOYD
</b>tttIt's important.  We had a little

tttour runners got hit for 12 grand.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttt(calmly)
tttWhich one?

<b>tttttFLOYD
</b>tttMottola.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttYou sure he didn't just pocket it?
<b>t
</b>

<b>tttttFLOYD

tttgrifters on 47th.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttThey workin' for anybody?

<b>tttttFLOYD
</b>tttI don't know.  Could be.  We're

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttAll right, mark Mottola up a little
tttand put him on a bus.  Nothin'

</b>
tHooker, still in his suit, but looking a little worse for

tttwasn't so pale, I'da sworn you had
tttclass.

tHooker steps inside and walks right into a big hug from an
tolder black woman, Alva.  Alva has a hat on, obviously just
tabout to go out.  Beyond her we see the Eirie kid and the
tBlack Man (known from here on as Luther Coleman) playing a
tgame of mah jong on the dining table with a man whose back
tis to us.  An 11-year-old boy is listening to the radio.

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>tttTurn that down, Leroy.

<b>tttttALVA
</b>tttOh, Johnny, Luther said you was
tttsomethin' to see today.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI'll never be as good as that mark,
tttAlva.

<b>tttttALVA
</b>tttWell, we gonna hear all about it
tttwhen we get back from church.
tttLeroy, get your jacket on, boy.

tLeroy goes to get his jacket.  Louise is finished putting
tthe baby to bed.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttYou goin' to church now?

<b>tttttALVA
</b>tttThey been havin' late bingo down
tttthere.  I'm gonna call on the Lord
tttfor a little cash, while he's still
tttpayin' off.  Luther, you look in on
tttthat child from time to time, will
tttya?

tLuther nods that he will.  Alva, Leroy and Louise leave for
tchurch as Hooker strolls over and tosses two packets on the
ttable.  Luther doesn't pick his up, but the other man does.
tWe now see that he is the thief in the opening sequence.  He
tis called the Eirie kid and he is delighted at his share.

<b>tttttEIRIE KID
</b>tttHey, Luther told me he was carrying
ttta wad, but I didn't figure this much.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttWhich way did he do, Eirie?

<b>tttttEIRIE KID
</b>tttStraight north.  He was gonna take
tttit all and run.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(laughs)
tttThe bastard.  He can blow his nose
tttall the way.

tThey laugh again, but Luther doesn't share their enthusiasm.
tHe watches Hooker who becomes uncomfortable under his gaze.

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>tttYou're late.  Where you been?

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(flopping into a chair)
tttI had some appointments.

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>tttt(not fooled)
tttHow much did ya lose?

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(after a pause)
tttAll of it.

</b>tttt(pissed)
tttIn one goddamn night?  What are ya

tttYou coulda been nailed.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI checked the place out.  There
tttweren't no dicks in there.

</b>tttNo class grifter woulda' done it,
tttthat's all.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttYou think my play is bad?

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>tttI think it's the best...

tHooker sinks back, embarrassed that he misread Coleman's
tintentions.

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>ttt...It's the only reason I ain't
tttquit before now.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(bewildered)
tttWhat?

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>tttI'm gettin' too slow for this

tttdo.  You hang on too long, you
tttstart embarrassin' yourself.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttWhat are you talkin' about?  We
tttjust took off the biggest score
tttwe've ever had.  We can do anything
tttwe want now.

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>tttIt's nothin' compared to what you

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttHey look.  You think I'm gonna run
tttout on ya or somethin'?  Just cause
tttwe hit it big.  Luther, I owe you
ttteverything.  If you hadn't taught

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>tttt(a little embarrassed)
tttAw hell, you sound like some

tttI know.  You got nothin' more to

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttBut you played the Big Con.  You

tttt(pause, holding up
ttttthe money)
tttI been lookin' for this one all my

tttto step out at the top.

tHooker knows it's no use.

<b>tttttHOOKER

tttWhat the hell you gonna do with
tttyourself?

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>tttAw, I got a brother down in K.C.,

ttthalfsies with 'em!  It ain't too
tttexciting, but it's mostly legal.

tHooker just nods.

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>tttStraighten up, kid.  I wouldn't
tttturn ya out if ya weren't ready.
tttt(flipping Hooker a
ttttpiece of paper)
tttI got a guy named Henry Gondorff I

<b>tttttCOLEMAN
</b>tttThat's the way I want it.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. A DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tIt's late at night now.  Hooker and Eirie wander along the
tstreet together, not really ready to go home, but with no
tother ideas either.  Hooker, obviously preoccupied, idly
tstrikes a match on a street lamp as he passes and lets it
tburn out.  He does this several times.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttHow do you like that Coleman, huh?
tttAfter three years.

<b>tttttEIRIE KID
</b>tttAw come on, it was the only thing
tttto do.  He knew he was holdin' ya
tttback.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttWe were partners.  If it weren't
tttfor Luther I'd still be hustlin'
tttpinball down at Gianelli's.  I
tttdon't need anything more than I got.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttYou ain't gonna have nothin' if you
tttdon't lay off them games of chance.
tttThere's a depression on ya know.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttThere's always a depression on.

<b>tttttEIRIE KID
</b>tttIf you saved a little, you wouldn't
ttthave to grift so much.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI like griftin'.

<b>tttttEIRIE KID
</b>tttYou could buy yourself some things.
tttClothes, or a nice car...

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI don't look any good in clothes
tttand I don't know how to drive.
tttWhat else ya got to sell, Eirie?

<b>tttttEIRIE KID
</b>tttForget it.

tThey walk on a few more feet, when suddenly a police car
tpulls up alongside them and two men jump out.  The first, a
tuniformed policeman, grabs Eirie around the neck.

tHooker makes a break for it, but the second Figure, a burly
tdetective named Snyder, tackles him in the middle of the
tstreet, drags him back into the alley and plasters him up
tagainst a brick wall.  The two have met before.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttHi there, Snyder.  Things a little
tttslow down at the Bunco Department
ttttonight, eh?  Somebody lose the
tttdominoes?

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttYou scored blood money today,
tttHooker.  You need a friend.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(knocking Snyder's
tttthand away)
tttAw, find yourself a shoplifter to
tttroll.

tSnyder gives Hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it
twith an elbow across the head.  Hooker flies into a row of
tboxes and garbage cans.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(getting up slowly)
tttYou got the wrong guy, pal.  I been
ttthome with the flu all day.
tttt(rising to a fuller height)
tttYou can stake out my toilet if you
tttwant.

tBang.  Snyder, infuriated by Hooker's irreverence, slams him
tto the ground again.  The policeman is no longer holding
tEirie but is almost daring him to make a move.  Eirie wants
tto go to Hooker's aid, but he knows the policeman will beat
thim to a pulp.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttt(pulling Hooker out
ttttof the heap and
ttttsmashing him against
ttttthe wall again)
tttI'll tell ya what you did, smart
tttboy.  You tied into a loaded mark
ttton 47th across from Maxies.  You
tttand Coleman played the switch for
ttthim and blew him off to a cab on
ttt49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers
tttrunner for Doyle Lonnegan, it
tttwoulda been perfect.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(startled by the information)
tttYou're crazy.  I'm not stupid
tttenough to play for rackets money.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttNot intentionally maybe, but that
tttdon't make no difference to Lonnegan.
tttHe'll swat you like any fly.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI'll square it with the fixer.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttNobody can buy you a prayer, if I
tttput the finger on ya.

tSnyder lets go.  Hooker sinks back against the wall.  He
tsays nothing; he's waiting for the price.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttI figure your end of the score was
tttat least 3 gees.  I want 2 no
tttmatter what it was.
<b>t
</b>

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(lying)
tttMy end was only one.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttt(not taking the fake)
tttThen you'll have to come up with
tttanother grand somewhere.

tHooker is beat and he knows it.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttAll right.

tHe reaches into his coat, pulls out a stack of bills and
tcounts out $2000 to Snyder.  Eirie looks on in amazement; he
tdidn't think Hooker had it.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttt(pocketing the money
ttttand motioning his
ttttpartner to put his
ttttgun away)
tttYou're a smart egg, Hooker.  No use
tttdyin' for 2 grand.

tSnyder and his policeman friend get in their car and start
tdown the street.  Hooker and Eirie walk nonchalantly in the
tother direction.

<b>tttttEIRIE KID
</b>tttI thought you blew all your money.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI did.  That stuff I gave him was
tttcounterfeit.  They'll pinch him the
tttfirst place he tries to spend it.

tSnyder and his partner disappear around a corner.  Hooker
tsuddenly takes off like a shot.

<b>tINT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT
</b>
tHe runs into a drugstore and goes to the phone booth.
tThere's already a woman in it.  Hooker rips open the door
tand throws her out.  Hurriedly, he begins to dial.

<b>tttttEIRIE KID
</b>tttt(standing outside the booth)
tttWhat the hell you gonna do when
tttSnyder rushes his finger right to
tttLonnegan?  You're committin'
tttsuicide, kid.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(waiting for the ring)
tttAw Christ, it doesn't make no
tttdifference now.  If Snyder knows
tttabout it so does everybody else.
tttHe never gets anything first...Damn,
tttthere's no answer at Luther's.

<b>tttttEIRIE KID
</b>tttListen to me, Hooker.  What ever
tttyou do, don't go back to your place
ttttonight, don't go anyplace you
tttusually go, ya hear me?  Get outa
ttttown or somethin', but...

tHooker, still getting no answer, slams the phone down and
tblasts out of the booth.

<b>tEXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tEirie chases him frantically, calling him to come back, but
the's giving away too many years and there's no stopping
tHooker at this point.

tPumping down the street.

</b>
tHooker races into Luther's brownstone, charges up to the
tthird floor.

<b>tINT. LUTHER'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
</b>
tHooker runs up through a small group of people on the stairs.
tHe bursts into Luther's room, the door of which is already
topen.  The room shows signs of a struggle, a turned-over
tchair, a broken lamp, but there is no Coleman.  Hooker goes
tslowly to the window.  He looks down into the courtyard and
tthen suddenly sprints back out the door.  As we hear him
tscrambling down the stairs, the camera dollies to the window
tand looks out.

<b>tEXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
</b>
tThere on the concrete below, face down, is the body of
tLuther Coleman.  Hooker races out to it and kneels down.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(shaking the body)
tttC'mon Luther, get up.  You gotta
tttget up, Luther.

tIn the distance, sirens are heard.  Heads are out of the
twindows and some people are starting to gather in the
tcourtyard.

<b>tttttHOOKER (CONT'D)
</b>tttGoddamn you, Luther, will you get
tttup?
tttt(pounding on the body)
tttI'm not waitin' for you, Luther.
tttI'm not waitin' anymore.  Get up,
tttyou son of a bitch.  Goddamn you,
tttLuther, goddamn.

tThe sirens are close now, and Hooker tears himself away from
tLuther and runs.  The others gather to look at the body.

</b>
<b>ttttttttFADE OUT.
</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tINT. THE TRAIN STATION - DAY
</b>
tWe open on Hooker sleeping in some remote corner of the
tstation, covered with newspapers for warmth, and barely
tdistinguishable from the clutter of junk surrounding him.  A
tstation security officer, on his morning sweep, wanders by
tand delivers a terrific blow to the soles of Hooker's feet
twith a nightstick.  Hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain,
tas the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping
tvictim.

tTired and sore from his night in the station, Hooker
tstruggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the
tsituation.  He tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit,
tbut it's futile.  A quick check of his wallet finds it as
tempty as he'd remembered it.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE STATION - GIFT SHOP - DAY
</b>
tHooker walks in and goes to the toy section.  He looks
tthrough several small novelties, till he finds what he's
tlooking for -- a little tin replica of a policeman's badge.
tHe looks around for station detectives, and seeing none,
tslips the badge into his pocket.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE STATION - WASHROOM - DAY
</b>
tHooker rinses out his mouth, towels off his face and slicks
this hair back with water.  It's a drop in the bucket, but it
tseems to revitalize him a little.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tSTATION - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tWe see Hooker removing a sign from a door, but the angle
tprohibits us from reading it.

<b>tINT. STATION - DAY
</b>
tHe drops the sign in a waste can and walks out into the
tcrowded passenger lobby.  After scanning the area carefully
tfor a minute, he goes up to a conservative young business
tman, who's busy reading the schedule board.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(flashing open his
ttttwallet to reveal the
ttttlittle tin badge and
ttttthen closing it again quickly)
tttExcuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept...
tttI'd like to ask you a few questions.

<b>tttttMAN
</b>tttt(flustered)
tttWhat for?  I haven't done anything.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttWe don't doubt that, but there's a
tttcounterfeiting operation passing
tttbad money in the station.  Have you
tttmade any purchases here today?

<b>tttttMAN
</b>tttt(reluctantly)
tttYes, a ticket to Chicago.

</b>

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttThen I'm afraid we'll have to

tttthat it's all good.  Can I see your

<b>tttttMAN
</b>tttt(handing them over)
tttBut I got a train to make.

tttIt'll only take 20 minutes or so.
tttYou can pick it up at the window

</b>tttBut what about all these other
tttpeople?

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(blowing up)
tttWe'll get 'em!  Give us a chance.
tttI'm not the only agent in here, ya

tttourselves, how many counterfeiters
tttdo you think we'd catch, huh?
tttt(pointing to his suit)
tttYou think I'm wearin' this rag here
ttt'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody
tttthinks life's a holiday or somethin'
tttwhen you got a badge.
tttt(pouring it on)
tttI been here since three this
tttmorning, Charlie, and I never knew
tttthere was so much ugliness in
tttpeople.  You try to help 'em and
tttthey spit on you.  I shoulda let ya

tttpassin' false notes.

tThe Businessman is totally shamed.

<b>tttttMAN
</b>tttI'm sorry, really I am, but my

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttAll right, I'll give ya a break.
tttt(pointing to a hall)
tttDown that hall there, there's an
tttunmarked door on the left.  Go on
tttin there and wait at the window.
tttI'll take this...
tttt(he holds up the money)
ttt...in the back and run it through
tttright away.  We'll have you outta

<b>tttttMAN
</b>tttThank you.  You don't know how much
tttI appreciate this.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(with a little wave)
tttThink nothin' of it.

tThe man goes off down the hall, more than grateful to be
tgiven a break like this.  Hooker heads for the "back".  We
tfollow the Man down the hall to the unmarked door.  He
tstrides on through to find himself face to face with a wall
tof busily flushing urinals.

tcould have missed that room.

<b>tEXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY
</b>
tThe street runs along side an elevated train track.  We pick
tup Hooker coming down the street, eating a hot dog he bought
twith the money he just earned in the train station.

tHe appears to be looking for an address, referring every now
tand then to the piece of paper Luther gave him the night
tbefore.  Finally he stops in front of an old three-story
tbuilding which contains a carousel on the bottom 2 floors
tand what appear to be apartments on the third floor.  He
tpeers inside the big, sliding glass doors and seeing no sign
tof life, goes around to the side to look for a way in.

tA 35 year-old woman, Billie, appears in her bathrobe on the
tsecond floor landing and descends the stairs to get the
tmorning paper.  She's eating an apple.  Although she has
tjust gotten up and looks it, she has the presence of one who
tis probably quite striking at other hours.  The sight of
tHooker fazes her not at all.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttExcuse me, I'm looking for a guy
tttnamed Henry Gondorff.  You know him?

<b>tttttBILLIE
</b>tttt(starting back up the stairs)
tttNo.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttLuther Coleman sent me.

tBillie stops and comes back down the stairs.  It's the first
ttime she's stopped chewing.

<b>tttttBILLIE
</b>tttt(checking him out)
tttYou Hooker?

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttYeh.

<b>tttttBILLIE
</b>tttWhy didn't you say so.  I thought
tttmaybe you was a copper or somethin'.

tShe goes to a side door and unlocks it.

<b>tttttBILLIE
</b>tttIt's the room in the back.  He
tttwasn't expecting you so soon though.

tHooker's not quite sure what that means, but there's
tsomething about Billie that makes him know that you don't ask.

<b>tINT. CAROUSEL - DAY
</b>
tHooker walks past the now motionless carousel to the room in
tthe back and knocks on the door.  No answer.  He gives the
tdoor a little push and it swings open.

<b>tINT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe room inside if small and cluttered, consisting of a bed,
ta sink, and a bathroom, all covered by a layer of books,
tdirty clothes and beer bottles.  Draped over a chair, fully
tdressed, but completely passed out is the one and only Henry
tGondorff.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(to himself)
tttThe great Henry Gondorff.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. A SHOWER - DAY
</b>
tWater blasting out of the fixture.  We see Gondorff, still
tfully clothed, sitting in the bottom of the shower, the
tspray streaming off his face.  An imposing figure, with deep
tset eyes and full beard, he just sits there stoically,
tlooking like a soggy lumberjack.  Hooker, sitting on the
tfloor between the toilet and the sink, watches listlessly.
tFinally --

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttTurn the goddamn thing off, will ya.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttYou sober?

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttI can talk, can't I?

tHooker makes no move to get up.  Gondorff struggles to his
tknees, turns off the water, and slumps back against the wall.
tThe two men just look past each other a second.  Down in the
tbottom.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttGlad to meet ya, kid.  You're a

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttYeh, Luther said you could teach me

tGondorff wipes his face with his hand.  His mood softens a
tlittle.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(quietly)
tttI'm sorry about Luther.  He was the
tttbest street worker I ever saw.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttHe had you down as a big-timer.
tttWhat happened?

</b>tttAw, I conned a Senator from Florida

tttYou played the Big Con since then.

tHooker's disappointment is obvious.

</b>tttBut don't kid yourself, friend, I

tHooker nods, unconvinced.

tLonnegan regards Floyd patiently and then pats the bench
tbeside him.  Floyd sits gingerly.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttYou see the guy in the red sweater
tttover there?

tWe cut to one of Lonnegan's foursome, a short, squat little
tIrishman in a red sweater.  He was a good-time, friendly
tmanner and a winning Irish smile.  We like him immediately.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttName's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy
tttwe called him.  Runs a few
tttprotection rackets for Carnello
tttwhile he's waiting for something
tttbigger to come along.  Me and Danny
tttbeen friends since we were six.
tttTake a good look at that face,
tttFloyd, cause if he ever finds out
tttwe let one lousy grifter beat us,
tttyou'll have to kill him and every
tttother hood in Chicago who'd like to
tttdo the same thing.  You understand
tttwhat I'm sayin'?

<b>tttttFLOYD
</b>tttYes sir.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttGood lad.

tLonnegan is called to the tee by one of his foursome.  He
texchanges a friendly smile with McCoy and belts the ball
tdown the fairway.

<b>tINT. THE CAROUSEL AGAIN - DAY
</b>
tGondorff, dried off now and in a new set of clothes, is
tpulling up the shades of the large facing windows of the
tcarousel building.  The morning light pours in, illuminating
tfully for the first time the ornate merry-go-round and its
tmassive oaken horses.  Hooker watches him go about his
tbusiness.  Billie calls down from the mezzanine which
tsurrounds the carousel.

<b>tttttBILLIE
</b>tttYou feeling all right this morning,
tttHenry?

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttFine, Billie.

<b>tttttBILLIE
</b>tttYou mind opening the round a little
tttearly today?  We got some business
tttcoming in before hours.

tGondorff waves okay.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(to Hooker)
tttGreat little countess, that Billie.
tttRuns a good house up there, too.
tttOne of the few left that Luciano
tttdoesn't own.

tGondorff walks around on the carousel, checking straps,
tbearing and poles.  Hooker follows him.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(getting impatient)
tttGondorff, you gonna teach me the
tttBig Con or not?

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(on his back, checking

tttYou didn't act much like you wanted
tttto learn it.

</b>tttI wanna play for Lonnegan.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(getting up)
tttYou know anything about him?

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(exploding)
tttYeh, he croaked Luther.  What else
tttdo I gotta know.

tGondorff just sits tight and waits for him to cool off.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(waving Gondorff off,
ttttembarrassed at his
ttttown outburst)
tttAw right, he runs the numbers outta
tttthe south side.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(going over to start
ttttthe machinery)
tttAnd a packing company, a chain of
tttSavings and Loans and half the

tttThere ain't a fix in the world

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI'll take him anyway.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(whirling on him)
tttWhy?

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(like steel)
ttt'Cause I don't know enough about
tttkillin' to kill him.

tIt's the right answer. Gondorff didn't know it himself until
tnow.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttYou can't do it alone, ya know.  It
ttttakes a mob of guys like you and
tttenough money to make 'em look good.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttWe'll get by without 'em.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttThis isn't like playin' winos on

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(incensed)
tttI never played for winos.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(going right on,
ttttignoring Hooker's remark)
tttYou gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even
tttafter you spent his money.  And no
tttmatter how much you take from his,
ttthe'll get more.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttYou're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttRight down to my socks, turkey.  If
tttI'da been half as scared a that

ttton 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me,
tttbut at least he won't bore me to
tttdeath.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttThen you'll do it?

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttIf I can find a mob that'll risk it.
tttBut no matter what happens, I don't
tttwant you comin' back to me halfway
tttthrough and sayin' it's not enough...
tttcause it's all you got.

tHooker nods.  Gondorff switches on the carousel and steps
tback to admire his handiwork.  The carousel makes a grinding
tsound, does a few lurches and stops cold.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
tMusic begins and we are into a short:

<b>tMONTAGE SEQUENCE
</b>
tDetailing the arrival of the others three members of
tGondorff's "mob." Throughout, Gondorff wears the fedora hat
twhich is his trademark.  We begin with --

tA tall, good-looking man, Kid Twist, making his way through
tthe railway station.  Impeccably dressed and carrying a
tsmall suitcase, he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes.
tFinally he catches a glimpse of the thing he's been looking
tfor.  It's Gondorff, standing by a newsstand.  Gondorff
tmakes a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off
ta gnat.  This is known among con men as the "office." Twist
treturns the sign with a barely discernible smile as he walks
ton by.  Con men rarely acknowledge each other openly in
tpublic, but it's obvious that these two are glad to see each
tother.

tGondorff gives instructions to the barber.

</b>
tHooker is modeling a new suit in front of a mirror.  He
tdoesn't look too pleased, but Gondorff peels out a bankroll
tanyway.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. HOTEL - DAY
</b>
tA pair of white spats stepping off a bus.  We follow them
tinto a:

<b>tINT. HOTEL LOBBY
</b>
tWhere we tilt up to reveal J.J. Singleton, the most
tflamboyant of the bunch.  On his way to the check-in desk,
the silently exchanges the "office" with Gondorff, who is
tsitting on a lounge reading the paper.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
tHooker being shown into a small apartment room by an old
twoman.  It consists of a bed, a table and a sink.  Hooker
tnods his acceptance to the woman and gives her a bill.  He
ttakes another look around the room and decides to go out
tsomewhere, but first he wedges a small piece of paper
tbetween the door and the jamb, about an inch off the floor.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. A BIG METROPOLITAN BANK - DAY
</b>
tWe hold on a slight, bespectacled teller, Eddie Niles, in
tthe process of counting a large deposit.  Niles is all
tbusiness; if he's ever smiled, no one knows about it.  He
tglances up for a second and sees Gondorff "officing" him
tfrom across the bank.  Without a word he shoves the money
the's been counting back into the hands of a startled
tcustomer, abruptly closes up his window, flips his
tidentification tag on the manager's desk and walks out of
tthe bank.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. AN UPSTAIRS ROOM OF THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
tThis room has obviously been relegated to the status of the
tstorage room.  It contains the water heater, mops and
tbrooms, old bed springs, etc.  In the middle of the room a
tspace has been cleared for a table, around which are seated
tHooker, Gondorff, Niles, Singleton and Twist.  Gondorff is
tin his T-shirt, but still wears his hat.  Kid Twist is in a
tsuit as usual.  The room is illuminated by a single bare
tbulb hanging from the ceiling.

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttt(showing Hooker
ttttphotographs of three men)
tttThese are Combs' favorite torpedoes.
tttRiley and Cole.

tWe recognize Riley and Cole as the two guys who got into
tMottola's cab.

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttThey do most of the small jobs, but
tttLonnegan might not wanna use 'em on
tttyou 'cause they're kinda messy.  No
tttclass.

tWe go to Hooker.  He's real grateful.  Billie, wearing an
tevening dress, enters the room and begins gathering up the
tempty beer mugs on the table.

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttWe got reason to believe Riley was
tttthe guy who hit Luther.  But if you
tttsee either one of these two, find
tttyourself a crowd, or take 'em
tttsomeplace you know you can handle
ttt'em.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttBut most of all let us know.  If
tttthey got a hit on you, we gotta
tttfold up the con.  You're too
tttexposed.  You got that?

tHooker nods, but we know he hasn't really got that.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttYou sure it'll be one of these two?

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttNo.  They're just the only ones we
tttknow of.

tBillie has finished  gathering the mugs, and leaves the room
twith them.  We follow her down the hall and into the:

<b>tRECEIVING ROOM OF HER BROTHEL
</b>
tCarousel music filters up from the arcade below.  The room
thas a bar along one wall and the rest of the space is taken
tup by tables and couches.  It's a comfortable place, but not
topulent.  Some of the girls sit patiently on the couches,
tothers play canasta at the tables.  Most of the men are at
tthe bar, fortifying themselves for the task at hand.  Billie
tcomes over to the bar.

<b>tttttBILLIE
</b>tttt(to the bartender)
tttSet me up five more beers, will ya
tttDanny.

tAs Danny goes to fill the mugs, Billie's eyes fix on a man
tat the end of the bar.

tWe move to reveal Snyder, intently scanning the room, as if
the'd lost a dancing partner in the crush.  Not finding what
the wants, he comes down the bar to Billie.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttYou the owner here?

<b>tttttBILLIE
</b>tttThat's right.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttt(flipping out his badge)

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttt(trying to ignore her remark)
tttI'm lookin' for a guy on the lam
tttfrom a counterfeiting rap.  Thought
ttthe mighta come in here.

<b>tttttBILLIE
</b>tttDon't think so.  I know everybody
tttin the place and I always bounce
tttthe lamsters.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttAll right if I look around your
tttlobby?

<b>tttttBILLIE
</b>tttNo, but you're welcome to a free
tttbeer before you go.

tBillie grabs a bottle of beer, pours some in a shot glass
tand pushes it over to Snyder.  He ignores the gesture.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttt(with controlled force)
tttI don't really need your permission.

tWe go to Billie.  She knew that when he came in.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

tThe discussion continues.  Hooker, a bit out of his depth
there, listens and stays silent.

<b>tttttSINGLETON
</b>tttLonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's
tttnot gonna sit still for a standard
tttplay.

tttWhat did ya find out about the
ttttrain, Eddie?

<b>tttttNILES
</b>tttHe's been taking the 8:10 Century
tttLimited outa New York on Friday and
tttgetting in here early Saturday
tttmorning.  He usually stays a day to
tttcheck on his policy operations, and
tttthen flies back.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttWonder why he doesn't fly both ways.

<b>tttttNILES
</b>tttThe porters say he runs a braced
tttcard game in one of the cars.  $100

ttthe pulled in here ten grand heavier
tttthan he left New York.

tttSee J.J., he's slowly down already.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

</b>tttWhich way are the rooms?

</b>tttWho told ya this guy was in here?

tttcan't spend all his time here.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

<b>tTHE STORAGE ROOM AGAIN
</b>
tBillie comes over to Gondorff and whispers in his ear, while
tthe others talk.  His eyes flick momentarily to Hooker.

<b>tttttSINGLETON
</b>tttI think we ought to play him on the
tttRag.  It's the tightest game we
tttgot, and it's not all over the
tttpapers yet.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttTwist is right.  It won't work.

tGondorff has nodded to Billie and now rejoins the
tconversation.  She serves the others beer.

</b>tttWe'll use the wire.  Never known a
tttgambler who wouldn't like to beat
tttthe ponies.

</b>tttThe wire is ten years outa date.

</b>tttI'm not sure I know it.

</b>tttAll you gotta do is show up with

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttI also gotta win.

tHe looks at Hooker.  There is a challenge in their book.
tGondorff smiles broadly, then casually, to them all.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttBy the way, any of you guys been
tttpassing off any green goods lately?

tWe go around the table.  No reply.

<b>tttttGONDORFF

tBillie smiles and leaves the room.

<b>tINT. HALLWAY
</b>
tShe walks halfway down the hall and stops.  She can't wait.
tLifting up her skirt, she finds that the five has indeed
tturned to paper.  As she breaks into laughter and continues
ton down the hall, we:

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT.
</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. A SUNKEN ALLEY - DAY
</b>
tActually little more than a service area between two
tapartment buildings.  Niles, Kid Twist, and a middle-aged
tblack man, named Benny Garfield, enter the alley with an old
tman and follow him down a stairwell to a subterranean
tbasement.  A faded sign above the door says Stenner's
tBilliards.  We follow them inside to a:

<b>tINT. A LARGE BARREN ROOM - DAY
</b>
tAn office comes off it at one end.  Judging from the
tfluorescent lights overhead and the scattered cue racks
twhich still hang tenuously on the walls, the place, indeed,
tused to be a pool hall.  Niles and Garfield go all the way
tto the back, while Twist stays near the front with the old
tman.

<b>tttttNILES
</b>tttLooks all right.  It's big enough
tttand off the street.

<b>tttttNILES
</b>tttGot to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark
tttin from New York on the Century.

tGarfield thinks it over a little.  He's taking another look

tWe pick up Doyle Lonnegan, accompanied by two bodyguards and

tand Hooker sitting on their suitcases on the other side of
tthe room.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(eyes fixed on Lonnegan)
tttGuy in the blue pinstripe and grey

tHooker looks and finally spots him in the crowd.  We go back
tto Lonnegan, as he moves off from the cigar counter, toward
this train.  Hooker watches him with the intensity of one
tgazing on a religious object.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttHe's not as tough as he'd like to

tLonnegan and his retainers getting on the train.  Two cars
tdown the line, we see Hooker and Gondorff boarding also.  On
this way in, Gordorff takes the conductor aside.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. A BASEMENT BAR - EARLY EVENING
</b>
tKid Twist enters and threads his way through the maze of
ttables to a door at the back of the building.  A large bull
tof a man is stationed there, obviously to discourage those
twho don't have credentials to enter.  Twist is not such a man.

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttt(going right on through)
tttHow ya doin', Lacey.

<b>tttttLACEY
</b>tttt(innocently pleased
ttttfor one so menacing)
tttGood to see ya again, Twist.

<b>tINT. ANOTHER ROOM - EARLY EVENING
</b>
tInside is another room, this one much better lit than the
touter one.  There are only three tables in here, around
twhich are seated the elite of the Con World.  Twist is
tenthusiastically greeted by Duke Boudreau, a large, rotund
tman whose stylish dress and authoritative manner mark him as
ta powerful figure in this group.

<b>tttttBOUDREAU
</b>tttTwist!  When did you get back in
ttttown?

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttCoupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE OUTER PART OF THE BAR AGAIN
</b>
tA silhouetted figure appears in the entrance doorway.  The
tword "chill" races from table to table and the place falls
tstill.  The bartender pushes a button behind the bar and a
tbuzzer goes off in the back room.  Boudreau gets up from his
ttable and opens a small viewing port in the door.

tThe silhouetted figure is now walking slowly past the silent
ttables.  It's Snyder and he's checking out every face in the
tplace.

</b>tttt(taking a look
ttttthrough the viewing port)
tttNo.  Never saw him before.  He's a

tSnyder walks all the way to the back, and then retraces his
troute.  About halfway back, he stops at one of the tables,
trecognizing a grifter he knows.  It's the Eirie Kid.

</b>tttYeh, he packed it in and enrolled
tttin detective school.

tSnyder, in no mood for jokes, grabs Eirie by the hair and
tslams his face into the table.  Eirie just stays there; he
tknows it doesn't pay to assault a detective.  Twist is
twatching all this intently from the viewing port.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttYou see him, you tell him to pay
ttthis debts before I get him.

tEirie raises his head slowly, but says nothing.  There is a
tslight trickle of blood from his nose.  Snyder turns and
twalks slowly out of the bar.  When he is a safe distance
tdown the street, the chatter and drinking resume.

tTwist gives an all clear signal and returns to the table
twhere he and Boudreau were talking.  Boudreau reads from a

tWe pick up Lonnegan coming out of his compartment, flanked
tby only one bodyguard and Floyd.  He starts through the
tpassenger section toward the compartment where the poker

taround the corner and bumps into him.

tThey grapple a moment and Lonnegan pushes her away in disgust.

tLonnegan ignores her and proceeds down the passageway.  As
tthe woman proceeds in the other direction between passengers,
twe see it is Billie.  She drops something on a seat beside a
tpassenger.  A hand reaches to pick it up.  It is Lonnegan's
twallet and it is Hooker who picks it up.

tHooker waits a moment, then stands and goes in the direction
tLonnegan has taken.  He passes by the open door to the card
troom, hesitating only slightly to hear the greetings

tAs he deals, on the second pass he attempts to cut from the

tA pair of hands shuffling.  We pull back to reveal that

tcut and turns to pen a new whiskey bottle.  Lonnegan takes
tthe deck and in one lightning motion substitutes a new deck,
twhile making it look like he's cutting the old one.

tGondorff picks up the deck and begins to deal.  As the hand
tis picked up, we see that Gondorff has four threes, Lonnegan
tfour nines, and everybody else has nothing.

tttSee, and raise the rest.

tLonnegan pushes in the rest of his chips.  Gondorff, who is
tonly required to match Lonnegan's total, throws in all his
ttoo.  It's a showdown.

</b>tttCall.

tLonnegan puts down his four nines.  Gondorff just stares at
tthem a second, lets out a deep sigh and lays down four jacks.
tLonnegan is aghast.  This just can't be.  He glances at
tFloyd, who can do nothing but sit there with his mouth open.

tttYou owe me 15 grand, pal.

tLonnegan, with a stare that could kill, reaches for his

thadn't expected this, but now that it's here, it better be

tWe concentrate on some of the fine details, i.e. Garfield
texplaining how the ticker will read out to Singleton and

tthe odds board properly.

</b>tttHe threatened to kill me.

<b>tttttGONDORFF (V.O.)
</b>tttHell, they don't do that and you
tttknow you're not gettin' through to
ttt'em.

tWe concentrate on Niles, who's making up the "boodles" or
tfake bankrollls.  He puts a real $100 bill on the bottom,
tthen two inches of cut green paper on top, and then another
t$100 bill on top of that, so that it looks like he has a
twhole stack of $100 bills.  The bundle is then bound with a
tsealed label, like those used in banks, that says $10,000.
tWe see that he has already made several of these bundles.

<b>tttttHOOKER (V.O.)
</b>tttThen he drove me home.  He tried to
tttput himself away as legit, so I

tAt first it appears to be deserted, but we move to reveal a

tProbably prosperous at one time, it has since declined, its

tHooker, who sits alone in a rear booth near the telephone.
tDressed in a tuxedo, he nurses a cup of coffee, and anxiously
talternates his glances between the clock and the empty
tstreet outside.  It's 12:52.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

</b>
tThe place is full of people, although we avoid long shot so
tas not to give away the room as a whole yet.  Instead, we
tconcentrate on the tense, waiting faces of some of the more
tfamiliar people:

tGondorff and Niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashier's area.
tGondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth.  Niles just
tstares out into space cracking his knuckles.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttEddie, cut that out, will ya.

tThe boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of
this odds board, checking every letter and number.  He stops
tto cross a T on one of the horses' names.  It was already
tcrossed, but he does it again anyway.

tBillie and Singleton, in an area hidden from the rest of the
troom, watching the print-out on the ticker machine.  The
tclicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store.

tCurly Jackson in front of a mirror, pasting a fake Van Dyke
ton his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle.

tA couple of Billie's girls adjusting their waitress outfits
tand primping their hair.  Each has a tray full of drinks
tbeside her.

tThe Eirie Kid silently retracing his "route" to make sure he
thas it down.

tDespite the crowd, there is no talking and little movement,
tsave for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars
tand cigarettes.  The group is like a theatre company waiting
tto go on opening night.

tIt's 12:56 and Hooker is worried.  He looks up to see two
tlarge men, obviously racket goons, come in the front door,
tand take a seat facing him in the next booth.  They stare at
thim impassively, waving the waitress away when she comes to
ttake their order.  Hooker knows they're Lonnegan's men, but
tis somewhat unsettled by the fact that Lonnegan is not with
tthem.  Suddenly, a voice.

<b>tttttVOICE
</b>tttCarver?

tHooker turns around to find that Lonnegan is seated in the
tbooth directly behind him.  His bodyguard is in the one
tbehind that.

</b>tttYou should always look to the back
ttttoo, kid.

tttt(pulling out a wad of bills)
tttAll you do is take this two grand

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttYou're not gonna break him with a

</b>tttThis is just a test.  The big one
tttcomes later.  Be careful with that
tttthough, it's all I got.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttAnd you were gonna pay me back?

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI am after this race.

tLonnegan says nothing.  He's not sure he likes a man who's
tstupid enough to bet his last dollar on a horse race.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttI gotta get back before Shaw misses
tttme.  Good luck.

tHooker hustles out across the street and into the alley.

tLonnegan watches him through the window and then settles
tback in his seat to wait for the phone.

tAs Hooker descends the stairwell into the store, he gives
tKid Twist the office.  Twist turns away from the window and
tlooks at his watch.  12:58.

</b>tttWe're waitin' for a call.

tThe man looks at Lonnegan a second, and then at his four
tgoons.  He decides maybe he'll make the call later.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

tpaper.  Kid Twist looks at it a second and then picks up the
tpohne and begins to dial.

<b>tINT. DRUGSTORE
</b>
tLonnegan again.  He's getting impatient now and lights a
tcigarette, and then the phone rings.  He answers it quickly
tand we hear:

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttBluenote at 6 to 1 on the nose.

tThe receiver clicks down at the other end.  Lonnegan hangs
tup and goes out the door, followed by his entourage.

<b>tEXT. STREET
</b>
tWe follow him across the street and into the alley, where he
tsignals one of the bodyguards to check the place out.  Kid
tTwist pushes a button on his window sill, and a buzzer goes
toff inside the store.  The previously inert figures there
tspring to life.

tLonnegan's bodyguard descends the stairwell and knocks at
tthe door, where he is greeted by Hooker in the capacity of
thost.  He looks the place over and motions an okay to
tLonnegan.

<b>tINT. THE STORE
</b>
tAs Lonnegan enters, we see the room for the first time in
tits entirety.  Overnight it has been transformed into a
tswank private club, with bar, cigarette girls, upholstered
tfurniture and chandeliers.

<b>tttttSINGLETON
</b>tttLook at that.  He's got four apes
tttwith him.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttThat's what I like about these
tttguys, J.J... They always got
tttprotection against things we'd
tttnever do to 'em.

tEverywhere there is activity.  A bank of telephones buzzes
tincessantly.  Sheet writers scurry from phone to phone,
ttaking bets of tremendous size from prominent people.

<b>tttttSHEET WRITER
</b>tttYes, Mr. Ruth, 20,000 on Dancing
tttCloud.

tWe reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch,
twhich one of the recruited con men operates from behind a
tpartition.

tThe boardmaker, wearing headphones suspended from a sliding
twire, hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard.
tFrom the loudspeakers we hear the words "last flash." The
todds on Bluenote settle down to 8 to 1.

tLonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting
tline.  His bodyguards fan out to various positions in the
troom.  The betting crowd itself (known as the "boost")
tconsists of close to twenty people, none of whom, of course
tare what they're pretending to be.  There are brokers with
tpasty faces, sportsmen, tanned and casual, and financiers
twith goatees and highly tailored clothes.  Large amounts of
tmoney are changing hands at the betting window.  Boodles are
tin sight everywhere.

tLonnegan slips into the betting line, feeling somewhat
testranged from the general merriment around him.  There are
ttwo men in line ahead of him.  The first, Curly Jackson,
tslaps down several bundles of cash in front of Niles, who's
tthe cashier, and places a $20,000 bet on War Eagle.  Gondorff
tappears at the cashier's window and catches sight of Lonnegan.

tttMake sure you see cash from this
tttguy, Eddie.  He's got the name for
tttbettin' money he don't have.

tThe man in front of Lonnegan puts $5,000 on Dancing Cloud.
tHe makes the bet on credit.  Lonnegan steps to the window.

tcomes on the loudspeaker.

</b>tttLadies and Gentlemen.  This is
tttArnold Rowe, your caller for the
tttsecond race at Belmont in New York.
tttA mile and 1/8.  Four year olds and

tWe see that the caller is Singleton, and that he's calling
tthe race from a concealed booth next to the cashier's cage.

tLonnegan goes to the bar, orders a drink, and settles down
tat one of the tables.  It happens to be the one the Eirie
tKid is at.  Gondorff and Niles watch it from the cashier's
tcage.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(worried)
tttThat's not where we want him to sit.

tEirie tries to ignore Lonnegan at first, but realizes he
tbetter make some conversation.

</b>tttC'mon War Eagle.
tttt(to Lonnegan)
tttThat Dancing Cloud's a hell of a

</b>tttYou know anything about a horse
tttnamed Bluenote?

<b>tttttEIRIE KID
</b>tttNaw, he's never done much.  Probably
tttin here just to round out the field.
tttWar Eagle's where you wanna have

tEirie excuses himself and heads for the bar.

<b>tttttCALLER
</b>tttInto the clubhouse turn, it's War
tttEagle by two lengths, Dancing Cloud
ttthas moved up to second by a half,
tttLucky Lady is third by three
tttfollowed by Jail Bait, Mojo,
tttBluenote and Wits' End.

tThe heretofore chaotic energy of the parlor is now focused
ton the race.  Several of the patrons begin to yell for their
thorses.  Lonnegan remains seated.  He seems bored with it
tall.  Hooker comes over to clear some empty glasses from his
ttable.

</b>tttt(out of the corner of

tttYou really picked a winner, kid.

tttBait, Wits' End and Mojo.

tLonnegan perks up just a little.  Bluenote, at least, has
tmoved up.  The rest of the people in the place are really
trooting now.  Few of them remain seated.

tHooker arrives at the bar, with the glasses he cleared from
tLonnegan's table.  Eirie is already there, fortifying
thimself with a scotch.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttYou're doin' great, Eirie.  He

tEirie nods, somewhat unconvinced, and heads bak to the table.

tttthird by a half and moving fast on

tttCloud, Bluenote and War Eagle.
tttt(shouting now)
tttDancing Cloud and Bluenote head to

tThe place is going crazy.  Even Singleton is standing up to
tget the necessary excitement in his voice.

<b>tttttCALLER

ttt2:01 and 6/10 seconds.

tMost of the patrons collapse into their chairs like spent

tttWar Eagle's where you want to have

tEirie doesn't reply.  He can't believe Bluenote won.
tLonnegan looks to Hooker.  Hooker gives him a wink.  For
tthe first time, Lonnegan permits a smile.

tNiles is counting out $16,000 to him (all of which Gondorff

tttAnd tell him not to bring his

tHooker, pretending to be humiliated, gets to his feet and
tescorts Lonnegan to the door.  Lonnegan stops, gives Gondorff
ta derisive smile, and walks out.  Once he's gone, the
tgeneral clatter and hubbub in the room cease, like it had
tbeen turned off by a faucet.  Most of the boost sit down and
trelax.  Curly Jackson rips off his Van Dyke.  It's been

tOne of the old, wooden kind -- accordian doors with glass
tpanes in the upper half.  Hooker dials rapidly.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttTwist?  I told him the tale.  He
tttwants to see ya.

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttAll right, when?

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttTomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside,
tttI'll come in and get ya.  And be
ttthard on him for a while; he's
ttttalking money.

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttOkay, Tootsie.

tHooker blows a mock kiss through the phone and hangs up.  He
tturns to leave the booth, when suddenly he sees something
tthat stops him cold.  There looking through the glass is the
tsmirking face of Detective Synder.  Hooker is immobilized.

tSnyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out
this gun.  He points it right at Hooker's face and then
tviolently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the
tdoor with the barrel.  Fragments of glass spray into the
tbooth, a couple of which imbed themselves in Hooker's cheek.

tHooker quickly whips open the door, trapping Snyder's hand
tin the accordian and jarring loose his gun.  Hooker sprints
tout of the booth as Snyder scrambles for his pistol and
tgives pursuit.

<b>tEXT. ALLEYS AND SIDESTREETS - NIGHT - THE TWO MEN
</b>
tWe follow the two men up alleys and sidestreets as they race
tthrough the dregs of the city, two panting shadows moving
tthrough places that only get light at night.  The wind blows
tdrops of blood off Hooker's cheek as he runs.  Snyder still
thas his gun, but would rather inflict pain than death.

<b>tCONDEMNED BUILDING
</b>
tHooker makes for a condemned building and scrambles up the
tstairs, steps giving way under him as he goes.

<b>tINT. BUILDING
</b>
tOn the fourth floor, he ducks into a room and quickly locks
tthe door.

tWe pan the room to reveal that the whole back side of the
tbuilding is gone.  Hooker runs toward the ledge and leaps
tthrough the air, landing on the fire escape of an adjacent
tbuilding, some 15 feet away.  He kicks in a window and goes
toff down the hall.  We cut back to

tSnyder furiously kicking in the locked door.  He finally
tcrashes through, only to find an empty room and a beautiful
tpanorama of the city and its nearest Hooverville.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tLONG SHOT - HOOKER
</b>
tWinding his way through the slum area of town, dashing along
tbackstreets, over fences and through vacant lots, making
tgood his escape.  From our angle, he looks like a rat in a
tmaze.

</b>
tLocated across the street from Hooker's apartment building.
tHooker sits down alone in a booth, with a plate of ham and
teggs he's hardly touched.

tThe two cuts on his face have pretty much stopped bleeding.
tA big fan above the counter area drones away lethargically,
tit's air stream insufficient to either cool the place or
tdrive out the smell of onions and grease.

tA waitress, Loretta, emerges from the kitchen and ambles
tslowly over to Hooker's table.  Slim and raven-haired, she
tmanifests an indifference bred from years spent delivering
tthings to people who are rarely grateful for what she brings.
tOnly a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side.

</b>tttt(putting the check

tttI don't know.  Depends what train I

tHooker looks for some sign that she's putting him on.  He
tdoesn't get it.  He takes out some money, drops it on the
ttable and walks out.

thops in the back.

</b>tttWhat happened to your face?

tMr. Harmon is looking over the authorization papers that
tTwist and Singleton have given him.  He can't find anything

</b>tttBrigham signed it all right.  I
tttcan't understand why he didn't tell

<b>tttttSINGLETON
</b>tttAh, he's like all them supervisors.
tttThey think they're too good for
tttregular people.  He says he was in
ttthere a while ago and the place was
ttta mess.

tHarmon looks around, hoping it's not true.

</b>tttWe'll try and hurry so we don't
tttkeep you out of your office too long.

</b>tttWhy can't I work with you in there?

<b>tttttHARMON
</b>tttAll right, how long will you be?

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttHour or two at the most.  We do
tttgood work.

tHarmon is resigned.  Twist and Singleton pick up their gear
tand march into the office.  Once inside, we notice that the
toffice has an exit door which opens to an outside alley.
tTwist immediately removes his overalls, revealing the suit
tand tie he's wearing underneath.  He takes out a picture of
thimself, a woman and three small children, and puts it on
tHarmon's desk, replacing a similiar picture of Harmon's
tfamily.  Singleton, meanwhile, has spread a few tarps and
tbegins to paint the walls.

tnot missing any of it.

tHe opens the door to find it empty except for a pile of

tDark and somewhat foreboding, its peeling dragons and shoddy

tagents have obviously been quartered here temporarily.  They
tall wear white skimmers, save for one, a portly man, Captain
tPolk, who paces the room smoking.  There is something long-

tHooker sits at the counter finishing a plate of meat loaf.
tLoretta is down at the cash register, leaning on the counter,
tlooking idly out into space.  Hooker glances over at her
tevery once in a while to see if she might be interested in
tstriking up a little conversation.  She's not.  He finishes
this meal and comes down to the register to pay his bill.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttMeat loaf, apple pie and a cup of

tHooker figures that's enough of that.  He pockets his change
tand starts out the door, when suddenly he stops short.

tAcross the street in a doorway is the silhouette of a man.
tIt's Cole.  He's pretending not to look at the diner, but
tHooker isn't fooled.

tHe goes back to Loretta at the register.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(urgently now)

</b>tttt(evenly)
tttHe'd like to kill me.

tLoretta just looks at him a second.  Realizing that this is
tno joke, she turns and walks slowly but steadily to the
tbathroom.  Hooker waits until she's out of sight.

<b>tEXT. STREET
</b>
tHooker goes to the front door and steps outside.  Cole looks
tup at the sound of the door.  Hooker makes a big show of
tspotting him, and runs back into the diner.  Cole, his cover
tblown, draws his gun and races across the street in pursuit.
tArriving just in time to see --

<b>tINT. DINER
</b>
tHooker go into the bathroom, he charges in after him, only
tto find the place empty.  He goes quickly from stall to
tstall, on the chance that Hooker might be hiding in one of
tthem.

tHe comes to one that's closed, and seeing a pair of woman's
tlegs under the door, rejects that, and moves on to the next
tone.

tWe cut inside the stall to reveal Loretta sitting on the
ttoilet with her skirt hiked up.  Right behind her, crouched
ton the back of the seat, is Hooker.

tCole has finished his rapid inspection now, and having found
tnothing, looks around for Hooker's probable escape route.
tHe sees the open window and climbs out to find himself in a
tsmall air shaft, from which he knows Hooker could not escape.
tHooker, seizing the time, bursts out of the stall and runs
tback out through the diner.  Cole sees him, but too late to
tget off a shot.  He climbs back in the window and gives chase.

<b>tEXT. STREET
</b>
tWe pick up Hooker barreling down the street with Cole a
thundred yards or so behind.  Hooker makes a sharp cut into
tan alley, and we see immediately that it's a hopeless dead
tend.  Inexplicably, he makes no attempt to run back out.

tCole draws up and cuts into the alley, anticipating the kill
twhich should be easy now.  He prepares to sight down his
tvictim, when suddenly he realizes there is no victim in
tsight.  Hooker, miraculously, has vanished.  Cole scans the
talley frantically for some trace of him.  There are no
twindows or doors at the street level.  Not even a drain pipe.
tJust brick wall.  It's impossible.  Hooker has disappeared
tinto thin air.

tCole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse,
tand starts back out of the alley, when all of a sudden he
tstops in utter terror.  His mouth drops open and he chokes
tout the words:

<b>tttttCOLE
</b>tttSalino, hey look.  I didn't mean to
tttmove in on...

tBefore anything else can come out, two bullets rip into his
tchest.  He falls to the concrete, coming to rest on a
tmanhole cover, which we notice is slightly ajar.  We:

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>

tthe slop, having gained another reprieve, but unaware that
twith two down, there is still one to go.

</b>
tHooker comes in the front entrance and goes to the elevator,
tone of the old-fashioned kind with the iron grid on the
tinside.  He's still a little rattled and waiting for the
televator is making him restless.  It finally arrives, and he
tsteps inside, closing the grid behind him.  As he starts to
tpush the button for his floor, he realizes for the first
ttime that he's not alone.  He looks to the corner to find
tSnyder, holding a gun on him.  This time there's not much
tdoubt that he'll use it if necessary.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

tGondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her.
tShe leaves to go start the merry-go-round.  Gondorff settles
tback into the game.

tttt(pause)
tttYeh, kid, it really stunk.  No

tWe follow him past the Carousel which is now full of giggling

<b>tEXT. A CITY STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tIt's late now and the street is deserted save for an
toccasional derelict or streetwalker on her way home from a
tnight's work.  We pick up Hooker coming down the street
ttoward his apartment building.  He walks slowly, almost
treluctantly, as if he didn't care whether he ever got there
tor not.

tAs he nears his building, he notices Loretta coming out of
tthe diner across the street.  He stops and watches as she
tlooks up and disappears into an adjacent building that
tadvertises rooms for rent.  After a few seconds, we see a
tlight come on in one of its second story windows.

tHooker just stands there a second, debating with himself,
ttrying to figure out a reason for doing what he's going to
tdo anyway.  We follow him across the street to Loretta's
tbuilding and:

<b>tINT. LORRETA'S
</b>
tHe goes up the stairs to the room where the light came on.
tHe passes a couple of derelicts on the way.  He knocks twice
tand Loretta answers in her bathrobe.  She is more than a
tlittle startled to see him.

</b>tttLooks like he missed ya.

</b>tttYeh, this time anyway.

tLoretta notices an old busybody peeping out at them from her

tttYou know me.  I'm just like you...

tA record spinning lazily on an old phonograph.  We hear
tRobert Johnson's "Come On In My Kitchen." Gondorff is
tsitting up in bed, with his hat on, lost in thought.  Billie
tis curled up asleep next to him.  There's a packed suitcase
tnext to the bed.  Billie wakes up and turns over a second.

tHooker and Loretta are asleep against each other, their
tbodies illuminated every few seconds by the light from a
tneon sign across the street.  We dolly to the window and
tmove in on another window in the building next door.  There's
tno light on in it, but we can discern the basic outline of a
tface behind the curtains, which are slightly parted to
tafford a view of Hooker's room by a black-gloved hand.

tWe open on Hooker in bed, the morning sun streaming in on
this face.  He awakens slowly, looks at the ceiling for a
tsecond and, remembering last night, turns to the side to
tfind that Loretta is no longer there.  Still drowsy, he gets
tout of bed and looks around the room for a note or some
tevidence of her continued presence.  He opens an empty
tcloset, then opens empty drawers.  Finding nothing, he
tsuddenly hits on another possibility, and looks in his
twallet.  The money is still there.  Almost disappointed, he
tslumps down in a chair, as the harsh reality of what will
thappen this day floods back in on him.  Music begins and we:

</b>tttWho are you?

<b>tttttGUNMAN
</b>tttGondorff asked me to look after ya.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttHow do I know you're tellin' the
ttttruth.

<b>tttttGUNMAN
</b>tttDon't have much choice, do ya?

tWe go to Hooker.  No, he doesn't.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
tWe pick up Polk, Snyder and the other federal agents coming
tout of the warehouse in their white skimmers, and piling
tinto cars.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE STORE AGAIN
</b>
tNiles is busily spreading "boodles" all over the cashier's
tarea.  Singleton checks his microphone.  It works fine.  He
tchecks it again.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tLONNEGAN IN HIS LIMOUSINE
</b>
tHe holds the brief case in his lap, his fingers tapping
tlightly on it.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE STORE AGAIN
</b>
tHooker and the gunman enter and go over to Gondorff, who
tbreaks into a wide smile.  Hooker returns it halfheartedly,
tstill ill at ease about what has happened.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE F.B.I. CARS ON THEIR WAY
</b>
tThere are four or five driving in a column.  Snyder and Polk
tride together in the back of the lead car.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY
</b>
tLonnegan's limousine pulls up outside, and the bodyguards
tpile out.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE STORE AGAIN
</b>
tGondorff, Hooker and the others waiting, the tension
texpressed in their faces.

<b>tINT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY
</b>
tLonnegan sits tensely in the usual booth.  He keeps both
thands firmly planted on the brief case.  The phone rings and
tLonnegan goes to it.  Music ends.

<b>tttttVOICE
</b>tttPlace it on Syphon at 8-1.

tLonnegan hangs up with the look of the financial killer.
tEight to one odds is more than even he could have hoped for.

<b>tEXT. STREET
</b>
tWe follow Lonnegan across the street and into the store.
tThe bodyguards remain outside.
<b>t
</b>

<b>INT. THE STORE
</b>
tThe store is buzzing with activity.  Money and booze are
teverywhere.  The sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly
tkeep up with the action.  Lonnegan walks quickly to the
tbetting line and finds to his relief that there's only one
tman ahead of him.  The man puts $25,000 on King's Image.

tLonnegan steps to the window, swings up the brief case, and
topens it for Niles to see.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttt(straight-faced)
tttFive hundred grand on Syphon.

tNiles is struck dumb.  He's never seen that much money before.

<b>tttttNILES
</b>tttt(playing the flustered
ttttclerk)
tttHold on, I'll have to get the
tttmanager.

tNiles goes and returns with Gondorff.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttWhat's the problem?

<b>tttttNILES
</b>tttt(pointing to the
ttttbrief case)
tttHe wants to put a half million on
tttSyphon.

tGondorff looks at the money a second and then looks up at
tLonnegan like he's gotta be crazy.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(uneasily)
tttI can't lay that off in time.  We
tttlose a bet that big, it could break
tttus.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttt(challenging)
tttIf ya win it could make ya, too.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(to Niles)
tttWhat are the odds on Syphon?

<b>tttttNILES
</b>tttEight to one.

tGondorff looks at Lonnegan long and hard.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttA half mill on an eight to one shot.
tttYou're dumber than I thought,
tttLonnegan.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttYou're more gutless than I thought.

tThe words "Last Flash" are heard on the speaker.  Gondorff
tlooks at Lonnegan with utter contempt.  He turns to Niles.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(chopped)
tttTake it.

tNiles hurriedly writes out a slip for 500,000 dollars.
tLonnegan, allowing himself a sly smile, picks it up and
tretires to a nearby table.  He flashes a little okay sign to
tHooker who acknowledges it with a nod.

<b>tttttCALLER
</b>tttLadies and gentlemen, this is
tttArnold Rowe, your caller for the
tttSan Antonio Handicap at Pimlico in
tttBaltimore -- A mile and 1/16 for
tttthree-year-olds.  And they're off.

tLonnegan takes a deep breath and leans forward in his chair,
tthe larceny boiling in his veins.  Hooker looks to Gondorff.
tGondorff gives him the "office." Hooker has to smile.

<b>tttttCALLER
</b>tttAnd around the first turn it's
tttKing's Image by a neck, Syphon is
tttsecond by one, Key to the Vault
tttthird by one half, followed by Mr.
tttMoonlight, Red Ridge, Moneyman and
tttNo Charge.

tUnexpectedly, Kid Twist bursts in through the entrance.
tBarely able to control his enthusiasm, he hurries over to
tLonnegan's table and sits down next to him.

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttSorry, but I just couldn't wait.
tttDid everything go all right?
<b>t
</b>

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttt(motioning for him to
ttttkeep his voice down)
tttTake it easy.  Everything's all
tttright.  I put it on Syphon, on the
tttnose.

<b>tttttTWIST
</b>tttt(in utter horror)
tttOn the nose!  I said place.  Place
tttit on Syphon.  That horse is going
tttto run second.

tLonnegan looks like he's just been stabbed.  He vaults over
tthe table to the teller's window and grabs Niles.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttYou give me my goddamn money back!
tttYou hear me?  There's been a mistake!

<b>tttttNILES
</b>tttI'm sorry, sir.  The betting's
tttclosed.

tLonnegan begins to shake him violently.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttYou give me my money back.  There's
tttbeen a mistake, do you hear me?

tGondorff leaps to Niles' aid when suddenly there is a crash
tat the entrance door, and Polk, Snyder and eight federal
tagents burst into the room, guns drawn.  The place falls
tsilent except for the loudspeaker, the members of the boost
tafraid to move.  Gondorff and Niles look at each other
twondering how this could have possibly happened.

<b>tttttPOLK
</b>tttt(motioning to Hooker)
tttAll right, Hooker, you can go.

tHooker's eyes go to Gondorff, who looks back at him in utter
tdisbelief, the betrayal raging in his features.  Hooker,
tunable to meet his gaze, lowers his head and starts to walk
tout.  Almost unnoticed, there's a flash of movement at
tGondorff's belt.  A small gun.  A shot.  Hooker clutches his
tback and falls dead on the floor, the blood spurting from
this mouth.  Polk, reacting instantly, pours four shots into
tGondorff, who goes down in a heap.  Pandemonium breaks loose.
tThe members of the boost race for the door.  Lonnegan is
ttotally stunned.  First he lost his money and now he's
tinvolved in a murder.  Snyder rushes over to him.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttC'mon.  We gotta get you outa here.

<b>tEXT. STREET
</b>
tSnyder drags him through the crowd and out onto the street
twhere an F.B.I. car is waiting.  His bodyguards have long
tsince fled at the sight of the F.B.I. men.

<b>tttttLONNEGAN
</b>tttMy money's back there.

<b>tttttSNYDER
</b>tttWe'll worry about that later.

tSnyder gets in beside Lonnegan, and the car speeds away.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINSIDE THE STORE AGAIN
</b>
tThe pandemonium has now ceased.  Those who could escape
thave; the rest are lined up against the wall in frisking
tposition.  Gondorff and Hooker lie on the floor dead.  The
tloudspeaker drones on.  Singleton is still calling the race
tfrom his booth, apparently oblivious to what's happened.

<b>tttttCALLER
</b>tttAnd the winner is King's Image by
tttfour lengths, Syphon is second, by
ttttwo, Moneyman third by two and one
ttthalf.  Time for 1 and 1/16 miles,
ttt1:21 and 2/10 seconds.

tPolk walks slowly over to Hooker's body and bends down.

<b>tttttPOLK
</b>tttHe's gone.

tHooker opens his eyes and slowly drags himself up off the
tfloor, spitting out a little rubber bladder, filled with
tblood, that he's had in his mouth.  Gondorff does likewise.
tNiles, Twist, Singleton and the rest of the boost begin to
tlaugh and shake hands, as do the Federal Agents.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttt(to Polk)
tttNice con, Hickey.  I thought you
tttwere Feds myself, when you first
tttcame in.

<b>tttttHICKEY
</b>tttNo problem, Henry.  Snyder went for
tttit all the way.
tttt(laughing)
tttYou shoulda seen the rag he lit
tttunder Lonnegan.

tGondorff turns to the others.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttOkay, let's take this place apart
tttand get outa here.  You can get
tttyour splits from Eddie at Boudreau's
ttttonight.

tGondorff walks over to Hooker, who's wiping the blood off
this face and hands.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttYou beat him, kid.

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttt(softly)
tttYou were right, Henry.  It's not
tttenough... But it's close.

<b>tttttGONDORFF
</b>tttYou wanta wait for your share?

<b>tttttHOOKER
</b>tttNaw, I'd just blow it.

tGondorff nods, and walks slowly to behind the bar.  He comes
tout with his suitcase in one hand and Hooker's paper bag in
tanother.  He throws the paper bag to Hooker, who stops by
tthe door.  Eirie Kid is standing there.  Hooker gives the
t"office" to Eirie, who beams and gives it back.

<b>tEXT. ALLEY AND STREET
</b>
tThen Hooker and Gondorff leave.  We hold on them, two
tragtail grifters again as they walk off down the street and
tdisappear around the corner.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT.
</b>
<b>tttttTHE END
</b>
