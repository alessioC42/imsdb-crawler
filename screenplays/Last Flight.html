</b><b>          FADE IN
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          On a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land, 
          surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. The distant roar of battle 
          RUMBLES ominously. SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment. 
<b>          
</b>          Abruptly, the image springs to life. The gun FIRES deafeningly. The nearby 
          branches shake violently. Another set of TITLES appears. The image FREEZES 
          again as a lone bugle plays a charge. Again and again and again, the image 
          moves, the gun DISCHARGES noisily, the image FREEZES and more sets of TITLES 
          appear with every FIRING.
<b>          
</b>          On the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose:
<b>          
</b><b>          WAR MONTAGE
</b><b>          
</b>          Nothing but FAST, BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of:
<b>          
</b>          Cannon firing in all directions. 
<b>          
</b>          Massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night. 
<b>          
</b>          Troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water 
          towering into the sky. 
<b>          
</b>          An entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar 
          fire visible above them on the horizon.
<b>          
</b>          Brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their 
          muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. Men yelling.
<b>          
</b><b>          FASTER AND FASTER, MORE AND MORE CHAOTIC:
</b><b>          
</b>          Mortar fire, explosions, smoke.
<b>          
</b>          A machine gunner fires.
<b>          
</b>          A soldier falls.
<b>          
</b>          Infantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze.
<b>          
</b>          More machine gunning.
<b>          
</b>          More soldiers go down.
<b>          
</b>          A massive gun fires.
<b>          
</b>          SMASH CUT of a tank tread bearing down on the CAMERA, blacking out the screen.
<b>          
</b>          Infantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery, firing pistols, rifles.
<b>          
</b>          A bridge explodes. A building explodes. The ground explodes.
<b>          
</b>          A bomb drops from an airplane.
<b>          
</b>          Aerial view of an exploding building.
<b>          
</b>          Anti-aircraft guns at work.
<b>          
</b>          Planes in the air.
<b>          
</b>          A machine gun fires skyward.
<b>          
</b>          Planes circle, filling the air.
<b>          
</b>          A single bi-plane.
<b>          
</b>          The plane's gunner, SHEP LAMBERT, looks down, surveys the situation, breaks 
          into a grin.
<b>          
</b>          Shep nudges his pilot, CARY LOCKWOOD, and points. Cary looks down to see:
<b>          
</b>          Another plane below. In it, pilot BILL TALBOT waves and salutes. FRANCIS, the 
          gunner, opens his mouth, smiles and nods up at them.
<b>          
</b>          An enemy plane arrives.
<b>          
</b>          The enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns.
<b>          
</b>          Bill and Francis' plane spins away.
<b>          
</b>          Bill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it, much to 
          Francis' amusement.
<b>          
</b>          The planes circle in the air.
<b>          
</b>          The enemy plane trails Shep and Cary. Shep FIRES his machine gun to no avail 
          as Cary watches.
<b>          
</b>          The enemy pilot returns fire.
<b>          
</b>          The two planes tango in mid-air.
<b>          
</b>          Shep FIRES.
<b>          
</b>          The enemy pilot grins and FIRES.
<b>          
</b>          Bullet holes riddle the side of Shep and Cary's plane.
<b>          
</b>          Cary warns Shep they've been hit.
<b>          
</b>          From the enemy plane's POV, Shep and Cary's plane streams black smoke.
<b>          
</b>          The two planes. Shep and Cary's plane goes into a steep dive, spinning out of 
          control.
<b>          
</b>          Cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him.
<b>          
</b>          Flames fill the cockpit as Cary's gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of 
          the red hot controls.
<b>          
</b>          The plane, streaming smoke, spins wildly downward.
<b>          
</b>          Shep, surrounded with smoke, looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry.
<b>          
</b>          Above, Bill and Francis watch. Bill returns the salute with a smile and waves. 
          Francis, though, doesn't look happy.
<b>          
</b>          Shep twists in his seat and looks around.
<b>          
</b>          Cary's hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit.
<b>          
</b>          ttttSHEP (o.s.)
          ttLevel off, Cary! Level off!
<b>          
</b>          Despite the flames, Cary pulls back on the control stick.
<b>          
</b>          From the plane's POV: The landscape rushes by.
<b>          
</b>          The plane, now level, crashes into the ground and comes to an abrupt stop.
<b>          
</b>          Smoke. Flames.
<b>          
</b>          Cary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to Shep who is struggling to 
          clamber out.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttShep! Shep, are you all right?
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttCan't make it, Cary. Can't make it.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttHere, give me your arm! I'll get 
          ttyou out of here! Hang on there, 
          ttShep! Get a hold - Just hold tight, 
          ttold fella.
<b>          
</b>          Cary pulls Shep out and hauls him away from the burning wreckage where the two 
          of them collapse to the ground, half-conscious.
<b>          
</b>          Flames consume the plane.
<b>          
</b><b>          tttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          A TEMPERATURE CHART
</b>          for Lieutenant Shep Lambert, a patient at U.S. Army A.E.F. Base Hospital 145. 
          Shep's temperature readings for October 11th to October 26th are indicated by 
          a line on a graph, near a level marked CRITICAL. The distant sound of battle 
          continues to RUMBLE.
<b>          
</b><b>          ANOTHER CHART
</b>          swings into view. This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for 
          October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line 
          continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is 
          marked NORMAL.
<b>          
</b><b>          tttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
</b>          The battle sounds are now joined by a loudly TICKING clock. With no sign of
          energy or emotion, Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital cot in full 
          uniform. Shep wears dark eyeglasses. Cary has a coat draped over his hands. He 
          glances off. We follow his gaze, PANNING past other patients in the hospital 
          to a wall clock and calendar. It is November 11th and the time is almost 
          eleven A. M. The battle's RUMBLE drones on.
<b>          
</b><b>          SHEP AND CARY
</b>          stare up at the clock. Behind his dark glasses, Shep's left eye twitches.
<b>          
</b><b>          THE CLOCK 
</b>          slowly DISSOLVES to one last BRIEF BATTLE MONTAGE: soldiers yelling and 
          running, guns firing noisily, a plane crashing, explosions. The final image is 
          of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a 
          stop as we DISSOLVE BACK TO the clock face. The center of the clock is lined 
          up exactly with the center of the propeller -- the slowing propeller blades 
          are replaced by the clock's hands -- as if to symbolically suggest that the 
          war has ended but time goes on. The NOISE of battle fades and only the TICKING 
          of the clock remains. DISSOLVE TO the calendar: November 11th, 1918 -- 
          Armistice Day. 
<b>          
</b><b>          SHEP AND CARY
</b>          sit motionless side-by-side on the cot. Shep has a hand over his left eye.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttWell, the old guerre is finie.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttThat's right.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttWhat are ya gonna do now, Shep?
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttGet tight.

</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttt(turns to him)
          ttAnd then what?
<b>          
</b>          Shep lets go of his eye and looks at Cary as if the answer were obvious.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttStay tight.
<b>          
</b>          Cary grins wryly.

</b><b>          tttttCUT TO:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NOT LONG AFTER
</b>          A nurse opens a door for Shep and Cary who enter. Shep wears his dark glasses. 
          Cary carries his coat to hide his hands. They pause as the doors they have 
          passed through close behind them.
<b>          
</b>          Their distinguished-looking doctor, a medical officer with a white gown over 
          his uniform, sits at his desk studying their papers.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttLieutenants Lambert and Lockwood.

          ttI'm sorry to release you two. I have 
          ttno choice in the matter.
<b>          
</b>          Shep removes his glasses and presses his hand to his eye.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttWhat am I going to do, Major, about 
          ttmy-- oh, this rotten business?
<b>          
</b>          The doctor examines Shep's eye more closely.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttMm? Spasmodic twitching of the 
          ttmuscles under the eye, eh, 
          ttLieutenant?
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttMm hm.

</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttWhat the French call a tic. T-I-C, 
          tttic. Little bothersome, isn't it?
<b>          
</b>          Shep puts his glasses back on.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttYes, sir.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttI'm afraid time'll have to take care 
          ttof that. Time and normal living. 
<b>          
</b>          Shep's lips tighten skeptically.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttYou two are returning to the United 
          ttStates, I presume?
<b>          
</b>          Shep glances at Cary.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttAh, we haven't decided.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttI'd take the first boat home. Well, 
          tthere you go.
<b>          
</b>          The doctor gives Shep his release form and shakes his hand, then turns to 
          shake Cary's. Cary merely looks down darkly and raises a bandaged hand at him.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttOh, I forgot your burnt hands. 
<b>          
</b>          The doctor folds up the release and stuffs it in Cary's breast pocket.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttNeither of you is fully hospitalized. 
          ttI'd undertake a systematic course of 
          ttfinger exercises -- to, uh, stretch 
          ttthem and loosen them up. In time, 
          ttyou'll regain their full use.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttThank you, sir.
<b>          
</b>          The doctor gives Cary a pat on the shoulder. 
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttBye, Lieutenant. 
<b>          
</b>          Cary manages a smile and salutes. Shep moves to the door, saluting the doctor.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttBye, Lieutenant. Good luck.
<b>          
</b>          Shep opens the door and he and Cary head out. After the door closes, the 
          doctor rubs his head thoughtfully. He talks, apparently, to an offscreen aide.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttDOCTOR
</b>          ttWell, there they go. Out to face

          ttAnd their whole training was in 
          ttpreparation for death.

</b>          He moves off as we

</b><b>          tttttCUT TO:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
</b>          Shep and Cary exit the building but pause outside the doorway. They've seen 
          something coming toward them and glance at one another before clearing out of 
          its path. They watch glumly as a small group of wounded soldiers enter through 
          some metal gates, walk slowly past Shep and Cary without acknowledgment, and 
          head into the hospital. 
<b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - PERHAPS SIMULTANEOUS
</b>          The office window opens. The doctor -- no longer in white but wearing his 
          uniform -- and his aide take a break, standing in the window frame for a 
          little fresh air. The doctor smokes a cigarette as they discuss Shep and Cary.
<b>

</b>          Two uniformed men with familiar faces -- exuberant pilot Bill and reserved 
          gunner Francis -- arrive at the bottom of the stairs in front of the hospital. 
          Bill, with his arm in a sling, and Francis, using a cane, start up the stairs 
          and wave.

</b>          From the stairs, Francis smokes a cigarette and looks down at Shep and Cary 
          uncertainly. But Bill takes the news in stride -- he smiles and waves his hat 
          at them.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. PARIS SIDEWALK - NIGHT
</b>          Strolling down the sidewalk four abreast, as if they own the town, come our 
          heroes -- Bill, Shep, Francis and Cary -- in smart hats and dinner clothes. 
<b>          
</b>          Outwardly, they seem to have recovered from their wounds. But: 
<b>          
</b>          Shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally glimpse his eye 
          twitching. 
<b>          
</b>          Cary's bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of his hands. His 
          personality is dark and dry, more subdued than Shep's, and he comes across as 
          the most levelheaded, rational member of the group -- its unacknowledged 
          leader.
<b>          
</b>          Francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll psychologically. A 
          narcoleptic, strangely detached and unemotional much of the time, always on 
          the verge of dozing off, his speech slurs even when he isn't drunk.
<b>          
</b>          Only the athlete of the group, Bill -- a burly Texan whose full name is 
          William Talbot -- is in outstanding physical shape. But he is reckless, 
          restless, and temperamental, covering up unnamed insecurities with bravado and 
          forced exuberance.

          drinking, conversing. At the end of the PAN, we discover our heroes entering, 
          greeted by an employee who takes their hats.
<b>          
</b><b>          ANOTHER VIEW - NEAR THE BAR
</b>          An attractive young woman with a wide, vacant stare stands against a wall 
          opposite the bar holding a champagne glass in her hands. Her name is NIKKI and 
          she seems to be in a world all to herself.
<b>          
</b>          Our four handsome heroes file past her, intent on finding a table. Only Cary 
          pays any attention to Nikki. After they have all passed her, he pauses to turn 
          and stare. She's extremely nearsighted and doesn't notice him. He looks at the 
          glass in her hand, puzzled. He starts off but then pauses. 
<b>          
</b>          After a second uncertain look, he moves off to join his friends who stand 
          together and peer around the crowded room, unable to find a place to sit. Cary 
          keeps looking at Nikki. He glances at the others and they follow his gaze:
<b>          
</b><b>          NIKKI
</b>          still wearing a blank expression, clutches the glass in two hands.
<b>          
</b><b>          THE GLASS
</b>          in her hands. Between her fingers, we glimpse its contents -- a complete set 
          of men's false teeth.
<b>          
</b>          We PULL BACK to discover that Cary has approached her. He's standing right 
          next to her and is staring at the glass. She finally notices him.

</b>          As quickly as they arrived, Shep, Bill and Francis depart. Cary starts after 
          them but stops to politely address Nikki who has gone back into her trance.

          Bill are delighted anyway. Bill brushes his hands (one of his favorite

          abruptly rises and leaves the bar. Mystified, Nikki looks quizzically at Shep

</b>          Cary immediately turns his attention to a menu. Rebuffed, Frink wanders over 
          to the bar and sees the other men. He has a friendly pat on the back for 
          Francis and Bill.
<b>

</b>          ttHello, Francis. Bill. 
<b>          
</b>          Frink pauses to stare at Nikki's back, astonished to find a woman sitting at 
          the bar. Then he turns to Shep, amused.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttShep. Drunk again?

          ttHi! Jean!
<b>          
</b>          Frink snaps his fingers at Jean and grabs a seat next to Shep. Jean asks for 
          Frink's order in French.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRINK

</b>          Francis holds his fingers to indicate a very small kite. Bill chuckles.

          ttSounds pretty pre-war to me.
<b>          
</b>          During all this, Nikki has been in her own little world. Frink leans over and 
          whispers to Shep.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRINK

          ttscattered around. 
<b>          
</b>          Around her neck, on a slender chain, Nikki carries a small lorgnette. It opens 
          with a spring and has small rectangular lenses. She uses it frequently, 
          peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless, nearsighted way. On Shep's 
          remark, she whips it out to stare at him, mildly offended. He raises his drink 
          to his lips and turns to her, speaking out of the side of his mouth:

          ttPay no attention. Sometimes he goes

<b>          
</b>          Nikki looks away glumly as Shep grins at her. She turns and sees something. 
          She raises her lorgnette for a better look at:
<b>          
</b><b>          CARY
</b>          who sits at his table, staring into space, holding his unread menu in his lap.

</b><b>          CARY

</b>          ttOh, I'm so sorry. Your hands... 
<b>          
</b>          She tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror and stuffs them 
          in his pockets.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttNIKKI
</b>          ttOh, your poor hands! Your poor, poor

<b>          
</b>          Wildly uncomfortable, Cary glances around like a cornered animal and finally 
          stalks away without a word, hands still stuffed in his pockets. Stunned, Nikki 
          watches him exit the building. She realizes she's done something terribly 
          wrong and moves to follow him.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttNIKKI
</b>          ttOh!

</b>          He clasps her hand and leads her to:

</b><b>          THE BAR
</b>          Francis and Bill watch, disturbed, as Shep guides a crying Nikki onto a stool 
          beside them. Shep sits next to her as she continues to sob. She pulls out a 
          compact to fix her tear-stained face.

</b>          Nikki takes a sip, then busies herself with putting away her compact. 
          Meanwhile, Bill leans in.

</b>          Nikki obediently hops off her stool and Shep leads her away from the bar, 
          toward the exit. Bill and Frink are distressed to see her go. Bill calls after 
          Shep:

          a restaurant. As it stops, Bill rises and points to someone at a sidewalk 
          table.

<b>          
</b><b>          THE SIDEWALK TABLE

<b>          
</b>          Bill and Nikki laugh at this. Suddenly, Nikki grows thoughtful.

</b><b>          ttttNIKKI
</b>          ttAll the same, he'd look funny the 
          ttother way -- even in a painting.

</b>          They all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of drinks arrives. Frink 
          abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.
<b>

</b><b>          ttttNIKKI

          ttto Jane. And that's how it all began.
<b>          
</b>          An odd CHIMING sound distracts them. They look off to see:
<b>          
</b><b>          FRANCIS
</b>          the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. He awakes with a frown, 
          pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. The 
          chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits. 
<b>          
</b><b>          AT THE TABLE
</b>          Nikki watches Francis' exit curiously. Bill waves her off before she can ask:
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttBILL
</b>          ttHe's goin' off to tame an alligator.

</b>          ttFrancis used to fly with us in the

</b>          ttI'll take vanilla.
<b>          
</b>          Cary puts a fist on his hip and gives Nikki an exasperated look. Taxi horns 
          squeak. Francis, Shep and Frink return from their various adventures and sit 
          down as Bill gives Nikki his opinion of Francis.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          They all look to see:
<b>          
</b><b>          A HORSE-DRAWN CAB 
</b>          rolling down the street in their direction.
<b>          
</b><b>          AT THE TABLE
</b>          Everyone watches as Bill rises and suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttBILL
</b>          ttLook out, horse!
<b>          
</b><b>          THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB 
</b>          rolling along as Bill runs in and tackles the horse, locking his big arms 
          around the animal's front legs to trip up the poor creature.
<b>          
</b><b>          ON THE SIDEWALK
</b>          Cary, horrified, stands and yells:
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttHey, Bill! Bill! Come back here!
<b>          
</b>          Cary runs off, toward Bill, leaving a thrilled Shep and a worried Francis with 
          a distressed Nikki. They all stare in concerned amazement as a crowd of 
          pedestrians stops to watch the excitement.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttNIKKI
</b>          ttt(distraught)
          ttOh, Bill!
<b>          
</b><b>          AT THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB 
</b>          Cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttHey! What's the idea -- runnin' 
          ttdown my friend like that? Here! 
<b>          
</b>          Cary forces a wad of francs into the driver's hand. The cabman protests in 
          French but takes the cash.
<b>          
</b><b>          WIDER VIEW
</b>          of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab. Standing up now, Bill 
          tries to haul the horse to its feet while Cary tries to placate the driver.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttNever mind. Look where you're going 
          ttin the future now. You just watch out 
          ttwhere you're going!
<b>          
</b><b>          ANOTHER VIEW
</b>          Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up. The horse, sorely 
          annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive Bill away. 
          Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. Cary tries to pull Bill away as 
          Frink, Francis and the driver gather around. Bill is more interested in 
          petting the horse which understandably shies away from him.
<b>

          ttone of these days. Now, come on, get 
          ttout of here. Now, listen--
<b>          
</b>          Satisfied with the outcome of all this, Bill heads back for the sidewalk.

</b>          ttt(to the driver)
          ttYou all right now, brother?
<b>          
</b>          The driver nods but is more concerned with reining in his skittish horse.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttAll right. Now, you just keep your 
          tthorse, see? You got your money.
<b>          
</b>          The cabbie salutes Cary but pays more attention to his horse.
<b>          
</b><b>          BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE
</b>          The waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group returns. Bill happily 
          dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket. Cary, beside him, leads him to his 
          seat. They all sit down under the following:

</b>          Francis immediately understands that she's become one of them. He raises an 
          olive in the air and cheers:

</b><b>          BACK AT THE TABLE
</b>          Frink watches Nikki disappear from view and, after a glance at the others, 
          rises and follows her. Shep, Bill and Cary remain at the table, laughing and 
          drinking. Bill turns to Cary with a smile.

          moving spotlights, unfurls in the huge, darkened ballroom which is ringed with 
          crowded tables. A handsome male dancer, in tuxedo and top hat, whirls 
          exuberantly around the floor, surrounded by beautiful chorus girls. 
<b>          
</b>          Somewhere above all this, Nikki, lit by spotlight flashes, sits on the edge of 
          a ringside balcony observing the show with eager interest through her 
          lorgnette.
<b>          
</b>          The show continues: after a few twirls, the dancer links arms with the girls 
          to form a line and do some precision high-kicking. The music continues but the 
          dance apparently ends and the lights come up. Impressed, Nikki is breathless.

          Francis sit glumly on one side of the table as Bill tries to tell a story to

</b>          The group enters the spacious, empty lobby, laughing loudly. Someone says, 
          "Wheeee!" Others say, "Ssshhh!" They cross to the front desk.
<b>          
</b><b>          AT THE FRONT DESK
</b>          The clerk is fast asleep, his head down on the desk. Nikki is about to wake

</b>          Bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators. 
<b>          
</b>          Once they've gone, Bill, the athlete, vaults the front desk and lands -- with 
          a little noise -- on the other side, without waking the clerk. 
<b>          
</b>          He cautiously checks the clerk to make sure the sleeping man hasn't awakened, 
          then fetches Nikki's key from its cubbyhole. 
<b>          
</b>          Bill leaps up on top of the desk, landing on his rear end, swinging his legs 
          around -- nearly kicking the clerk in the process -- then silently slides off 
          the desk to the floor. 
<b>          
</b>          Watching the sleeping clerk warily, Bill tiptoes away. 
<b>          
</b>          At the last possible moment, Bill purposefully WHACKS the signal bell with his 
          hand, making it RING noisily. The clerk awakens with a start and grabs a 
          nearby telephone just as Bill disappears from view.
<b>

</b>          Amused, the group piles into the "ascenseur". Last one in is Bill who shuts

</b>          Bill brakes the car too quickly -- it slams to a halt and everyone loses their 
          footing, nearly falling down. Part of the light fixture above them breaks 
          loose and crashes down on Frink's head, much to everyone's amusement -- they 
          laugh as Frink clutches his head, annoyed.

          Francis tries to enter a room but Frink pulls him out of the doorway. Bill 
          backtracks to help Frink escort Francis. This allows Cary and Nikki to take

</b>          During this, Francis has casually inspected a curtained walk-in closet near 
          the table. He pulls the curtain to reveal a rack of carefully hung dresses and 
          a floor covered with dozens of shoes organized in impeccably straight lines.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRANCIS
</b>          ttSay, I never saw so many shoes.
<b>          
</b>          The others gather to peer into the closet. Frink loses interest immediately 
          but whistles at the sight of Nikki's sheer nightgown draped across her bed. He 
          moves to it eagerly. 
<b>          
</b>          Nikki sits on the edge of the bed removing her shoes as Frink picks up her 
          silk bedclothes and examines them with a grin. Bill pointedly takes the gown 
          out of Frink's hand. Tight-lipped, Frink stares at him. Suddenly, Bill points 
          to a small wind-up clock on Nikki's night table.

</b><b>          ttttBILL
</b>          ttLook!

</b><b>          SITTING ROOM
</b>          Bill takes a pillow from the sofa and tosses it across the room. He proceeds 
          to leap feet first onto the sofa, fall on his back with his feet in the air, 
          then stretch his legs out across the sofa, lying down to go to sleep.

          the sofa, apparently preparing to lie down on it.

</b>          Cary, perhaps pleased with Nikki's attention to him, watches her withdraw into

</b><b>          LOW ANGLE SHOT - SITTING ROOM

          Francis, his head on a pillow, lies on the floor, stretching his legs and 
          yawning as only a narcoleptic can.

</b><b>          NIKKI   
</b>          holds the bottle in her hand. The men's hands reach for it but Bill is quicker

          shakes eau de Cologne onto a towel.

</b>          More scrubbing and then an amusing pantomime: To Nikki's bewilderment, Bill 
          pulls back the hair over her ear, looks down into her ear, cleans it out with 
          his little finger, flicks wax off his finger daintily, buffs the ear with the 
          towel, and finally blows sharply into the ear, causing her to wince. She

</b><b>          CARLTON BAR - ANOTHER VIEW
</b>          We start on a CLOSE SHOT of three drinking glasses as the bartender breaks a 
          raw egg into one. Beside them are the other ingredients of a potent hangover 
          remedy. We PAN OVER to the three men:

</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttSay, we'd better get back to our

</b>          Francis shakes his head, he has no idea.

</b><b>          ttttBILL
</b>          ttWe can move him in, too.
<b>          
</b>          Francis nods in agreement. Shep thinks it over as the drinks arrive.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttNot a bad idea!
<b>          
</b>          Shep pays off the bartender who departs with a mumbled "thank you." The three 
          men each down their nasty hangover cures in a single swallow and move off one 
          at a time -- first Shep who exhales deeply, then Francis who takes it in 
          stride. Finally, Bill exhales happily and claps his hands as he follows the 
          others out, their hangovers apparently remedied.

          sitting in a chair next to the phonograph, smoking a cigarette and checking on 
          the progress of her paint job. A snappy knock at the door.

          Francis finds his way to the sofa, which has been returned to its proper spot 
          in the room. He lies down and shuts his eyes.

<b>          
</b>          Cary smiles. Nikki, Bill and Shep share a laugh. The Asian woman goes right on 
          painting as Bill and Shep study Nikki's legs. During this, Nikki hands her 
          cigarette to Cary who moves to put it in an ashtray by the window.

<b>          
</b>          Cary manages a slight grin. As he does, there's a knock at the door. Everyone 
          hollers, "Entrez!" Shep runs to the door and opens it.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttOh, boy! Here come the drinks!
<b>          
</b>          The others cheer happily. Two hotel employees enter carrying trays loaded with 
          already poured drinks. Shep hands a glass to Nikki.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttHere, Nikki, drink this.

</b>          Shep hands Bill a glass.
<b>          
</b>          Francis sits groggily on the sofa, a drink in each hand. He polishes off one 
          and then the other. He leans over and sets one empty glass on the floor but 
          holds on to the other as he puts his head to the nearby pillow and dozes off.
<b>          
</b>          Cary, Bill and Shep crowd around Nikki who is still seated -- all have drinks. 
          The tray-carrying hotel employees have apparently exited. Bill proposes a 
          toast.
<b>

</b>          They drink. Another knock at the door. They all yell, "Entrez!" The door opens 
          to reveal Frink -- whose face falls when he sees the other men with Nikki. The 
          others are not happy to see him, either.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Cary hands his glass to Bill and moves to meet Frink as he enters.

<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttMorning, Nikki.
<b>          
</b>          After a pause, Nikki looks up at him uncertainly as if she doesn't recognize 
          him. Then she peers at him through her lorgnette.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttNIKKI
</b>          ttOh, it's you. 
          ttt(after a pause,

</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttThank you.
<b>          
</b>          Frink moves off to find a chair. Shep sets down his drink and follows him. 
          Frink starts to move a chair but Shep stops him.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttSay, I don't think Nikki likes you.

<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttWell, what do YOU hang around for?

</b><b>          ttttSHEP

          ttNikki any posies.

</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttI-- Well--
<b>          
</b>          During the above dialogue, Bill nudges Cary mischievously and they glance down 
          at the tray in front of them. They exchange knowing nods, pick up some drinks, 
          bring them over, and offer one to Frink.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttBILL
</b>          ttHave a drink?

</b>          ttLet's see. Hold out your hands.
<b>          
</b>          Bill and Shep watch with interest as Frink holds out his hands, palms up.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttNo, turn them over.
<b>          
</b>          Frink turns them over, palms down. Cary looks at Frink's steady hands, 
          impressed.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttSay, that's pretty good. 
<b>          
</b>          Cary looks down at the drink in his own hand.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttLet's see if you can hold this.
<b>          
</b>          Cary sets the glass on top of Frink's downturned hand. Frink balances the full 
          glass with ease.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttSay, that's great.
<b>          
</b>          Cary places a second full glass on Frink's other hand. Frink balances both 
          glasses with ease. Cary expresses keen admiration.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttSteady as a rock!
<b>          
</b>          Frink looks at the others, a little smugly. Cary slowly backs away and walks 
          off, as do the others. Frink's face falls as he realizes he has been left 
          standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced on top of his 
          hands and no way to safely remove them.
<b>          
</b>          Cary, Shep and Bill return to Nikki and crowd around her.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttWell, I guess that'll keep his hands 
          ttout of mischief for a while.

</b>          Frink, abandoned, reluctantly pleads with the others.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttHey. Take these off.
<b>          
</b>          But the others simply ignore him.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttNow, let's see. Where were we before 
          ttwe were so rudely interrupted?
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttBILL
</b>          ttWe were talkin' about Nikki's legs.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttThat's right. We were talkin' about 
          ttNikki's legs. And havin' a fine time, 
          tttoo.
<b>          
</b>          The Asian maid who has been working on Nikki's feet abruptly rises.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttWOMAN
</b>          ttFinis.
<b>          
</b>          The men cheer, "Yay!" and Nikki smiles at the woman as she exits with her 
          tools. The men crowd closer to peer down at Nikki's legs.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttLet's inspect the job.
<b>          
</b>          But Nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttNIKKI
</b>          ttOh, my poor toes. Don't look too 
          ttclose.
<b>          
</b>          Nikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under body. Since she's 
          no longer using her footstool, Cary commandeers it and sits on it.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttWell, what's the matter with your 
          tttoes?
<b>          
</b>          Nikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story -- very slowly. Her 
          eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible sadness.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttNIKKI
</b>          ttWell... when I was a little girl...
<b>          
</b>          A worried look crosses Cary's face.

          tthave a drink, quick!
<b>          
</b>          Their eyes pop. The men jump up eagerly and run off. Nikki, thoroughly 
          nonplussed by this, takes a sip of her drink. Shep, Cary and Bill crowd around 
          a tray and start imbibing. 
<b>          
</b>          Meanwhile, Frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to lose the two glasses 
          that are still balanced on his hands.
<b>          
</b>          For the first time in this scene, Nikki is on her feet. She walks over to the 
          drink tray and puts a friendly hand on the shoulders of Shep and Cary.

</b>          ttAnd now would you all excuse me?

</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttWell, why not?
<b>          
</b>          Nikki walks off, exiting into her bedroom. The men continue to stand around 
          the tray, drinking. In the background, Francis sleeps on the sofa.
<b>          
</b>          Over by the fireplace, a frustrated Frink, still balancing the two drinks, 
          casts a dirty look at the others. He angrily hurls the glasses into the 
          fireplace, smashing them loudly. Francis, startled awake by the noise, jumps 
          off the sofa. The others stare at him.

</b>          Frink, furious, rubs his hands with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his 
          pocket.

</b>          ttYou guys think you're so darn smart.

</b>          Shep, Bill and Cary laugh at this. Cary consults his pocket watch.

</b>          ttWell, cheerio, fellas. I'm off.

          the front door.

</b>          Nikki draws the curtain to reveal her enormous collection of dresses and

          as he watches Nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put on a seemingly 
          identical pair of red ones.

</b>          Passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day. A taxi cab pulls up to a sidewalk 
          cafxe9 -- LA REGENCE, according to the awning that covers the little iron 
          tables. Cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as Nikki hurries 
          under the awning. Cary joins her and, after a word to the driver ("Restez

</b>          The waiter acknowledges this and heads inside, calling out the order to his 
          bartender. Cary joins Nikki at the table and sits down. She removes her gloves 
          and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights it under the

</b>          A mountain of trunks and other luggage piled on the floor. Nikki sits down 
          near Shep who finishes packing a suitcase on the floor.
<b>

</b>          Francis leans casually on the towering pile of luggage. Bill stands next to 
          him, smoking a cigarette and calling ironically to Nikki:

</b>          by Nikki's little Asian maid. The fancy beribboned wicker basket has an 
          oversized handle which makes it a rather improbable turtle carrier. Bill 
          secures a wire mesh covering over the basket and carries it out of the 
          bathroom, handing it grandly to Francis.

</b>          ttHey! I never tended turtles before.

          hand. 
<b>

</b>          Some of the water ends up in Francis' eye which he wipes with the basket's 
          ribbon. Nikki walks off and Francis practices soaking his hand and sprinkling 
          the turtles.

<b>          
</b>          Bill, glass raised, proposes a toast. On the wall behind him is the shadow of 
          the drunken old man, standing in roughly the same pose.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttBILL
</b>          ttWell, men, fire and fall back!
<b>          
</b>          As Bill drinks, the old man's shadow wobbles forward. Bill hears the sound of 
          liquid SPATTERING. He stops drinking and looks puzzled.
<b>          
</b>          A stream of liquid pours down onto Bill's right foot, soaking his sock and shoe.
<b>          
</b>          Bill turns to find the drunken old man leaning at an unsteady angle, the 
          alcohol spilling steadily out of a glass in the man's hand and onto Bill's 
          foot.
<b>

</b>          ttHey! What's the idea?

</b>          The others, lined up at the bar, see this and laugh. The drunken old man 
          brushes some lint off Bill's jacket as Bill shakes his pant leg, amused.
<b>

</b>          The group hurriedly finish and exit. Shep pays the tab. Bill, followed by the 
          old man, shakes his pant leg and limps along after the others.

</b>          The crowd CHEERS and the band PLAYS as a parade of matadors, picadors and 
          banderilleros enters the ring.
<b>          
</b>          Led by their guide, Pedro, the group takes seats in the front row, back of the 
          trenches. They have to sit close down so Nikki can see things. The drunken old 
          man from the bar tags along behind Bill like a puppy dog and tries to sit next 
          to him but Pedro pointedly directs him to a seat in the second row.
<b>          
</b>          When Bill rises to cheer the parade, the drunken old man also rises and taps 
          him affectionately on the shoulder. Bill turns and greets him pleasantly, 
          shaking his hand.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttBILL
</b>          ttWell! My old pal!
<b>          
</b>          The old man tips his hat to Bill and sits. Bill shakes his pant leg and gives 
          the old man a wry look before also sitting. 
<b>          
</b><b>          IN THE RING
</b>          The parade ends. A matador throws his montera (his black woolen hat) into the 
          crowd.
<b>          
</b><b>          IN THE FRONT ROW
</b>          Cary catches the hat, much to the group's delight -- they shout "Hooray!" 
          Immediately, a cape is hurled at Bill who drapes it over the railing before 
          them. Cary offers the hat to Nikki.
<b>

<b>          
</b><b>          IN THE RING
</b>          A bull charges into view. Bull-fighter and bull face off. The bull makes ten 
          passes, faster and closer each time.
<b>          
</b><b>          IN THE FRONT ROW
</b>          Bill sits next to Pedro.
<b>

</b><b>          ttttPEDRO
</b>          ttSure, it's dangerous. Bull-fighting 
          ttis very dangerous. It takes a lot of 
          ttcourage to go into the bull ring.
<b>          
</b>          Bill scoffs and waves dismissively. Cary leans in with a query.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttIs it true the bull is blind when he 
          ttcharges?

</b><b>          IN THE RING
</b>          Bull-fighter and bull continue their duel. Finally, the bull gets the 
          advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull.
<b>          
</b><b>          IN THE FRONT ROW
</b>          Bill is unimpressed.

</b><b>          IN THE RING

          runs wild, out of control.
<b>          
</b><b>          IN THE FRONT ROW
</b>          Frink nudges Francis awake and points out the carnage in the ring. Francis 
          glances at the spectacle briefly and then sleepily applauds. Frink gives him a 
          look and nudges him to stop clapping. Francis simply goes back to sleep.
<b>          
</b><b>          WILD BULL MONTAGE
</b>          The toreros try to control the bull but it refuses to cooperate. 
<b>          
</b>          The crowd watches intently. Bill takes off his own hat and picks up the 
          matador's cap that Cary had caught.
<b>          
</b>          Toreros scramble and run for their lives. The bull chases them down, runs 
          across the ring, forcing them to jump the barrera, the protective wooden 
          barrier that circles the inside of the arena. 
<b>          
</b>          Bill, now wearing the cap, can't resist leaning over and mocking a group of 
          toreros who huddle in the callejon, the safe side of the barrier, just below 
          him.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttBILL
</b>          ttNice work, Tony! Nice work, Joe!
<b>          
</b>          The toreros look up at Bill in surprise. One of them responds in Portuguese 
          with a gesture toward the ring, as if to ask "If it's so easy, why don't you 
          try it?" The other toreros laugh.
<b>          
</b>          Bill stares into the ring, a savage look in his eyes. He puts a leg up on the 
          railing.
<b>          
</b>          He jumps down into the ring.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY'S VOICE

</b>          ttBill! Come back here!
<b>          
</b>          But it is too late. Bill's coat is already off and he waves it like a cape as 
          he stalks after the bull.
<b>          
</b>          The bull turns and sees him.
<b>          
</b>          Bill moves toward it, waving his coat and grinning like a madman.
<b>          
</b>          Shep is frozen. Beside him, Nikki screams and turns away.
<b>          
</b>          The bull begins to charge.
<b>          
</b>          Cary climbs over the railing.
<b>          
</b>          The bull charges.
<b>          
</b>          TRACK FAST TOWARD Bill who holds the coat before him -- big eyes, big grin.
<b>          
</b>          The bull is on him. The bull roars.
<b>          
</b>          Bill's face snaps backward in a blur, his coat follows. 
<b>          
</b>          The bull gores him through his coat. His face twists in pain. 
<b>          
</b>          CUT WIDE as the bull knocks Bill's body around the ring like a rag doll. He 
          hits the ground hard. Screams from the crowd.
<b>          
</b>          Four toreros rush in.
<b>          
</b>          They surround and distract the bull. Bill lies motionless.
<b>          
</b>          Cary runs across the ring.
<b>          
</b>          More toreros and others rush in, surrounding the bull, finally leading away.
<b>          
</b>          In the front row, Shep, Nikki, Francis, Frink and Pedro watch with concern as

</b>          Bill reaches up and pats Cary on the shoulder. Cary looks at the doctor, then 
          at Bill, before retreating to the door. He turns to look back at Bill who 
          grins at him.

</b>          ttSee ya later - Cary.

</b>          Cary can't return the smile. He turns and goes, closing the door behind him. 
          Bill's attention turns to the doctor whose approaching shadow is cast on the 
          wall behind him. Bill's smile fades.

</b>          At a nearby refreshment stand, we find the group, minus Bill. Everyone is 
          unusually silent and wearing dinner clothes. Francis holds a mug upside-down. 
          Frink leers at Nikki who ignores him while she, Shep and Cary down their 
          drinks. They hear:

</b><b>          THE SHOOTING GALLERY
</b>          where an assortment of rifles and pistols are neatly laid out. Cary and Shep 
          escort Nikki to the arsenal while Frink and Francis tag along behind. An 
          attendant joins them to collect their money and ready their weapons.

</b>          Shep FIRES and misses the moving cats that float across the base of the range 
          on an endless chain and disappear. But he hits a tinier target: a clay pipe 
          behind them.
<b>          
</b>          Shep's eyes pop with surprise.
<b>

<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttWell, let's see you shoot something.
<b>          
</b>          Nikki awkwardly raises her little target rifle to her shoulder. The end of the 
          barrel describes uncertain circles in the air. A multiple exposure point-of-
          view shot of the targets reveals that Nikki is a little too tipsy to be 
          handling a gun. Cary moves to help her.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttOh, no, no, no, Nikki.

          ttright. Now just hold it evenly--
<b>          
</b>          Rapid GUNSHOTS. Cary looks up in surprise. He and Shep turn to watch in 
          amazement as Francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle, shattering a whole 
          row of pipes with split-second firing.
<b>          
</b>          The others cheer as Francis lowers the weapon and stares moodily at an 
          astonished and, apparently, very drunk Frink. Cary takes this moment to 
          encourage Nikki.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttYou can do better than that. Show 
          tthim up.
<b>          
</b>          She again tries unsuccessfully to hold the rifle steady. Amused, Frink picks 
          up a pistol and imitates her.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttWhat are you waving at, Nikki?
<b>          
</b>          Cary sees Frink pointing his gun at Nikki and moves to intervene, grabbing 
          Frink's wrist with both hands.

</b>          Shep and Francis move to shield Nikki.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttWhat's the idea?
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY

<b>          
</b>          Frink violently pulls free of Cary's grasp and, as he does, the gun goes off 
          with a BANG. Francis hurries Nikki to safety in the opposite direction. Shep 
          backs away, clutching his side -- for a moment, it looks very much as if he's 
          been hit. Cary pursues and confronts Frink.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttPut down that gun!
<b>          
</b>          Frink backs up to a nearby lamp post and, wielding the pistol, points it at 
          Cary. His face is tense, savage.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttListen, you keep your hands off me!

          ttme--!
<b>          
</b>          A nervous crowd of passersby pauses to watch the showdown.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttOh, so that's how it is. I thought 
          ttwe taught you how to behave.
<b>          
</b>          Frink, drunk and frustrated, starts to lose it completely.

</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttToo bad for who?!
<b>          
</b>          Frink cocks the hammer.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttOne ...
<b>          
</b>          Cary moves slowly toward Frink.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttKeep away from me! I'll shoot, I 
          tttell ya! I'll shoot!

</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttTwo ...
<b>          
</b>          Frink and Cary are less than a yard apart.

</b><b>          ttttFRINK
</b>          ttI'll shoot! I'll shoot!
<b>          
</b>          GUNSHOTS. Cary flinches. Frink drops the pistol, his face twisted in pain. He 
          starts to fall.
<b>          
</b>          Nearby, Francis coolly FIRES his rifle, pumping seven bullets into Frink.
<b>          
</b>          Members of the crowd SCREAM in terror. Instinctively, Shep (still clutching 
          his side) and Nikki each put a restraining hand on Francis' arm. Francis 
          lowers the rifle, staring in horror and amazement at what he's just done. 
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY'S VOICE
</b>          ttFrancis? 
<b>          
</b>          Cary rushes over and pulls the rifle out of Francis' hands.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttFrancis?
<b>          
</b>          Francis snaps out of his trance as Cary hurriedly returns the rifle to the 
          gallery. Shep and Nikki watch, stunned, as Francis immediately moves to Cary 
          and shakes his hand.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRANCIS
</b>          ttGoodbye, Cary. 
<b>          
</b>          Francis turns to Shep and Nikki for equally heartfelt handshakes, an odd look 
          on his face.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttFRANCIS
</b>          ttShep. Nikki.
<b>          
</b>          They realize he is saying a final goodbye. The crowd presses in as Francis 
          glances back at Frink before turning and hurrying off. 
<b>          
</b>          As a huge crowd rushes in the direction of the shooting gallery, Francis 
          threads his way through it in the opposite direction and, with only the 
          briefest glance backward, rounds a corner to disappear behind a building.
<b>          
</b>          Cary stares at Frink's body as the gathering crowd streams into view, then 
          quickly starts to lead a shaken Shep and Nikki away from the shooting gallery.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttWe've got to get out of here. Come 
          tton, Shep. Come on.
<b>          
</b>          They slip through the thick fringe of excited people fast gathering in front 
          of the shooting gallery and hurry off in the same direction as Francis who is 
          now:
<b>          
</b><b>          BEHIND THE CARNIVAL BUILDINGS
</b>          on a dark, deserted street. Distant crowd NOISE and carnival MUSIC drifts in. 
          Under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival, Francis strolls 
          casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope, pausing 
          to glance backward. He sees ...
<b>          
</b>          ... Cary, Shep and Nikki as they round the corner and pause, a little 
          breathless, to lean against a wall. Shep, his fist still at his side, slumps 
          weakly as Cary and Nikki stare at ... 
<b>          
</b>          ... Francis who briefly makes eye contact and then, without a word, turns, 
          steps over the rope and, pulling his jacket collar up around his neck, walks 
          off, instantly swallowed up by the darkness.
<b>          
</b>          Cary and Nikki stare after him, astonished.

          is as edgy as Shep is subdued.

<b>          
</b>          Cary turns to Shep, who slumps back weakly against his seat with a strange 
          look of release and satisfaction on his face.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttIt's a forgery.
<b>          
</b>          Cary examines Shep, reaching in to feel his bloody wound.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttNIKKI
</b>          ttDo something for him, Cary! Oh, 
          ttShepard!

</b>          ttHe's been shot!

<b>

</b>          ttGood old Cary. Sweet Nikki. You may

          ttthing that ever happened to me.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttOh, Shep, Shep, don't say that. 
          ttYou'll be all right. We'll get you 
          ttto a hospital.
<b>          
</b>          Shep puts a hand on Cary's arm as the taxi continues to jolt along down the 
          street. 
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttNo, no, Cary. Don't rush me anywheres.
          ttLet's sit here for a while. The-- 
          ttHurts, the jolting.
<b>          
</b>          Urgently, Cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between themselves and the 
          cab driver.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttStop! Stop! 
<b>          
</b>          In front of the carnival's slowly revolving carousel, the cab rolls to a stop. 
          The carousel MUSIC drifts in. Shep hardly moves -- head back, blank eyes 
          staring, voice dreamy and weak. Cary puts his face close to Shep's, listening 
          intently.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttSHEP
</b>          ttThat's better. You know, Cary, I feel
           tt- just like we're falling -- long 
          tttime ago. Do you remember? Spinning 
          tt... spinning ... spinning. Only you

</b>          Shep's head slumps down. His face presses against Cary's shoulder. 
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttNIKKI'S VOICE
</b>          ttOh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
<b>          
</b>          Cary can't look at him. Eyes wide, Cary slowly presses his cheek to Shep's.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttCARY
</b>          ttShep? - Shep?! - Shep!
<b>          
</b>          Cary looks as if he is on the verge of tears. And yet he cannot bring himself 
          to cry.

</b>          Nikki cranks her portable phonograph, turns it on and puts the needle to the 
          record -- Toselli's "Serenade," that strange, sad composition that haunted 
          Europe at the close of the Great War. 
<b>          
</b>          As the bittersweet romantic music plays, she listens for a moment. Then she 
          turns and sidles over to sit next to Cary who is seated by the window, 
          scribbling something on a piece of paper beside a small lamp.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttNIKKI
</b>          ttWhat are you writing, Cary?
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Nikki reads the letter silently. A long pause.
<b>          
</b><b>          ttttNIKKI
</b>          ttWhy, Cary. Cary, that's the most

<b>          
</b>          Nikki turns away and begins to cry, quietly.
<b>

</b>          ttPlease forgive me for crying, Cary.

</b>          ttShep Lambert spent his life in the

</b>          He kisses her hand. A strange, apprehensive look crosses her face as she turns 
          her hand over in his hands and opens it -- to reveal a heart-shaped stone. 
          Cary looks at her in surprise.
<b>
