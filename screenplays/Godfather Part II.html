<b>FADE IN:
</b>
The Paramount Pictures logo is presented over a simple black
background, as a single trumpet plays the familiar theme of
a waltz.  White lettering fades in:

tt     Mario Puzo's THE GODFATHER

There is a pause, as the trumpet concludes, and there is the
additional title: - Part Two -

<b>INT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD OFFICE - CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b><b>CORLEONE - DAY
</b>
standing impassively, like a young Prince, recently crowned
King.

CLOSE VIEW ON Michael's hand.  ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand.
Then it is taken away.  We can SEE only the empty desk and
chair of Michael's father, Vito Corleone.  We HEAR, over
this, very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance,
as THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair.

<b>ttttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY
</b>
We can barely make out the funeral procession passing over
the burnt-brown of a dry river bed.  The figures move
slowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past.

The MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their
instruments harsh and blaring.

They are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the
crude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a
strong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the
arms of those walking with her.

Behind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and
paisani continue alone behind the coffin.

Suddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians
stop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd
directions along the rocky river bed.

The young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin,
throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground.
We hear a woman SCREAMING:

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttThey've killed young Paolo!  They've
ttkilled the boy Paolo!

<b>EXT. SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - MED. VIEW - DAY
</b>
across the slain body of a fourteen year old boy, lying on
the parched ground.  In the distance we see four or five of
the mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and
veils, running up to the body of the boy.  They begin to
wail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the
mother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his
fresh blood wetting her strong hands.

<b>EXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY
</b>
A boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being
pulled quickly by the hand.  This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is
to become The Godfather.

The VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by
his Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the
ornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble.

At various positions near the gates are men with shotguns,
or lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy
are shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He
wears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt
sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.  He wears a hat
to protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays
a gold watch and chain over his vest.

He sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden,
listening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only
son.

<b>ttttWIDOW
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttDon Francesco.  You murdered my
tthusband, because he would not bend.
ttAnd his oldest son Paolo, because
tthe swore revenge.  But Vitone is
ttonly nine, and dumb-witted.  He
ttnever speaks.

<b>ttttDON FRANCESCO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttI'm not afraid of his words.

<b>ttttWIDOW
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttHe is weak.

<b>ttttDON FRANCESCO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttHe will grow strong.

<b>ttttWIDOW
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttThe child cannot harm you.

<b>ttttDON FRANCESCO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttHe will be a man, and then he will
ttcome for revenge.

As she pleads, the Widow moves closer to the Don, until she
has practically thrown herself to her knees before him.

<b>ttttWIDOW
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttI beg you, Don Francesco, spare my
ttonly son.  He is all I have.  In
ttthe name of the Holy Spirit, I
ttswear he will never be a danger to
ttyou...

Suddenly, she reaches under her skirt, where she has hidden
a kitchen knife.

<b>ttttWIDOW
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttBut I will kill you myself!
ttt(she lunges at the
tttMafia chieftain)
ttVitone, go!

The boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates.  Then
there is a lupara blast.  He turns, and sees his Mother
flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the
terrible blast of the shotgun.  Then he sees the men turn
their attention to him.  One fires at him; but the boy is
quick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.

<b>EXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT
</b>
Two men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying
lupare.  Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a
loud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler.  Their
names are MOSCA and STROLLO.

<b>ttttMOSCA
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttOur Friend promises misery to
ttanyone who harbors the boy Vito
ttAndolini.
ttt(he turns and shouts
tttin the other direction)
ttOur Friend promises misery to
ttanyone who harbors the boy Vito
ttAndolini.

<b>INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A family quietly eats their dinner.  The father is the local
policeman, as indicated by his uniform jacket and gun,
hanging nearby.

<b>ttttSTROLLO
</b>ttt(Sicilian, O.S.)
ttOur Friend will be hard with any
ttfamily who gives help to Vito
ttAndolini.

One of the children looks up, about to speak.  But the
father sternly indicates that nothing must be said.  They go
on with their dinner.

<b>EXT. THE STREETS OF CORLEONE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
The men continue walking up and throughout the streets, far
in the distance.

<b>ttttMOSCA
</b>ttt(Sicilian O.S.)
tt...misery to any family who harbors
ttthe boy, Vito...

<b>INT. A BARN - NIGHT
</b>
Four little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and
father bind Vito tightly in swaddled cloth, and then lift
him up to the side of a mule; counter-balancing a heavy load
of firewood.  The father looks at the boy's almost stoically
calm little face.

<b>ttttFATHER
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttVito...We pray for you.

He pulls the fabric over the boy's face.

<b>ttttMOSCA
</b>ttt(Sicilian O.S.)
tt...Andolini...

<b>ttttSTROLLO
</b>ttt(Sicilian O.S.)
ttOur Friend promises misery to any
ttfamily...

<b>EXT. THE CHURCH PLAZA - NIGHT
</b>
The men continue on their night-walk, up to the plaza of the
church.

<b>ttttSTROLLO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
tt...who harbors the boy Vitone
ttAndolini.

The figure of a single man on a mule passes them.

<b>ttttMOSCA
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttLet no one give help to the boy
ttVito Andolini...

The man on the mule makes his way out of the village and
disappears into the distance.

We begin to hear, very quietly, the Waltz repeated once again.

<b>EXT. STEAMSHIP - CLOSE VIEW ON VITO - DAY
</b>
huddled in blankets, on the deck of the ship in Steerage.
He does not say a word.  The Waltz grows louder as the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled
together with all their earthly possessions on their way to
America.

Then, suddenly, the Waltz stops.

<b>THE NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY
</b>
SILENCE.  We glide past the Statue of Liberty.

VIEW on the IMMIGRANTS standing on shipboard silently;
looking.  Vito is standing with them, his eyes wide.

CAMERA MOVES IN on the statue, then MOVING PAST, on to the
beautiful buildings of Ellis Island.

<b>EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - DAY
</b>
A tugboat pulls a barge brimming with immigrants into the
Ellis Island harbor.  Uniformed officials of the Immigration
Service load them up toward the main building.

<b>INT. ELLIS PROCESSING HALL - DAY
</b>
The hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in
the great hall.  Various painted lines lead to the steps and
processing rooms above.

There is the babble of many interviews going on
simultaneously, uncertainly, in different languages.

Vito is bundled in an old coat, with a large tag pinned on
it: &quot;Vitone Andolini -- Corleone, Sicilia.&quot;

He stands, moves up in the line, when several other immigrant
boys, older than he, rush up an push him back in the line.
Weak from the trip, he falls to the floor.  The boys laugh,
derisive in a language he cannot understand.  He struggles
to his feet, lifting his makeshift bags; staring at them in
an icy hatred.

<b>INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Three or four interviews are crowded into the small room;
they are conducted in English.  From the expression on
Vito's face, and from the fragmented of the English, we
realize that he doesn't understand a word of it.

<b>ttttOFFICIAL
</b>ttt(English)
ttWhat is your name?

The man waits, impatiently.

<b>ttttOFFICIAL
</b>ttYour name?

Vito doesn't answer.  The Official pulls the tag pinned onto
his coat and copies to down on his form, using a typewriter.

<b>ttttOFFICIAL
</b>ttt(speaking as he types)
ttVito...Corleone.  Step up, over
ttthere.

He hands the form to another official.

CLOSE VIEW on the form.  The name has been entered as Vito
Corleone.

<b>INT. MEDICAL EXAM - DAY
</b>
Vito is stripped to the waist, as other immigrants wait.

The DOCTOR is just finishing his examination.  He shakes his
head, and then writes on the medical form.

<b>ttttDOCTOR
</b>ttCan you understand me?

Vito stares blankly.

<b>ttttDOCTOR
</b>ttYou understand?  Smallpox.  Smallpox.

He doesn't understand.  The doctor turns to the Immigration
Official.

<b>ttttDOCTOR
</b>ttQuarantine...six months.

<b>UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY - MOVING VIEW - DAY
</b>
Officials move a group of immigrant men, including Vito, to
the quarantine section of the Island.

<b>INT. QUARANTINE HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
The official stops at each doorway, and reads off a name.

<b>ttttOFFICIAL
</b>ttSalvatore Ormenta.

The man moves into the room, and the group proceeds.

<b>ttttOFFICIAL
</b>ttVito Corleone.

No one responds.  The guard moves to the boy, reads his new
name tag.  And then, not unkindly:

<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttThat's you.

He opens the door, and Vito enters the room.

<b>EXT. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY
</b>
The VIEW slowly begins to pull back, revealing this to be
the view from inside the quarantine cell, where Vito stands
on his bench, looking out to the statue through the barred
window.

Then he turns, and sits in the corner.  He is silent for a
long time.

Then, in a sweet, pure voice, he sings to himself in Sicilian.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - MOVING CLOSE SHOT - DAY
</b>
A nine year old boy, dressed immaculately in white, with a
large white silk bow tied to his shoulder, moving slowly
down the aisle of the church with a group of other children
dressed in white.  He has dark black hair, and his face is
unmistakably similar to young Vito's.  He moves slowly, his
hands clasped around a golden missal.  We HEAR only the pure
voice of Vito in Sicilian, his sad song reaching out from
the past, as ANTHONY CORLEONE, his Grandson, moves on the
way to his First Holy Communion more than fifty years later.

<b>FULL VIEW
</b>
The little children move in procession down to the Altar,
where the PRIEST raises the Host, and performs the Communion
Mass in Latin.

<b>ttttPRIEST
</b>ttEcce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit
ttpeccata mundi.

<b>MOVING VIEW ON THE PRIEST
</b>
and Altar boys, as he moves along the row of kneeling
children, blessing them, and administering their first
Communion.

<b>CLOSE MOVING VIEW
</b>
as the innocent faces receive the Host; finally, the Priest
comes to Anthony.

<b>ttttPRIEST
</b>ttCorpus Christi.

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttAmen.

<b>EXT. LAKE TAHOE ESTATE - DAY
</b>
The lawns of this great estate on the shore of Lake Tahoe
are covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the
First Holy Communion of Anthony Corleone, the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Michael Corleone.  A full dance orchestra plays music
of the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for
the occasion.  Speedboats roar through the water, pulling
youthful waterskiers; and the pool and private harbor are
filled with laughing, swimming guests.  It is Fall of 1958.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
Anthony, in his Communion suit sits alone at the table,
looking like a lonely young Prince.

<b>ttttKAY (O.S.)
</b>ttSmile, Anthony.  Smile.

He does, and a flash goes off.

<b>ttttPHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
</b>ttNow, one with the whole family.

<b>ttttKAY (O.S.)
</b>ttMr. Corleone can't right now...

KAY CORLEONE enters from the side, leading her four year old
daughter, MARY, and MAMA CORLEONE to pose with Anthony.

<b>ttttKAY (O.S.)
</b>tt...but we'll get one with the ladies.

<b>ttttPHOTOGRAPHER
</b>ttAll together now, c'mon, Anthony...
ttCHEESE and
ttt(flash)

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThank you.

She smiles as she leaves the photographer, and then lets out
a weary sigh to Mama, as she touches the slightly protruding
belly.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttDo you think it'll show in the
ttpicture?

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttTwo months never shows.  Two months
ttlook like you had a big lunch.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttOh, Mrs. Corleone.

A slender, aristocratic WOMAN in her late forties is waving
to KAY.

<b>ttttMRS. BARRETT
</b>ttHello, Mrs. Corleone.  I'm Fran
ttBarrett, our place is just down the
ttlake.  This is my husband, Marshall.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI'm so happy you could come.

<b>ttttMR. BARRETT
</b>ttThe place is transformed.  We've

ttall summer.

<b>ttttMRS. BARRETT
</b>ttWhere is Mr. Corleone?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttA business meeting ran late...but
tthe promised he wouldn't be long.

Kay puts her arm around little Anthony's shoulder.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThis is our son Anthony Vito
ttCorleone.  Today he made his First
ttHoly Communion.

<b>EXT. TAHOE GATE AND KENNELS - DAY
</b>
A confusion of cars; arriving and parking.  The squad of
parking attendants are supplemented by a whole team of the
local Police, working as high-class parking valets.

A very beautiful, statuesque woman, though slightly drunk,
DEANNA DUNN, slams the door of a powder blue Mercedes and
hurries barefoot through the great stone gate.

<b>ttttDEANNA
</b>ttI will not shut my mouth, and keep
ttyour Goddamn hands off of me!

She is followed by a harried, FREDDIE CORLEONE, dressed with
flash in the Hollywood style, and carrying her shoes in his
hands.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttHoney!  Wait a minute; let's go for
tta drive.

<b>ttttDEANNA
</b>ttI just had a drive; besides, I want
ttto see my brother-in-law Michael.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttt(trying to get her to
tttput her shoes on)
ttYeah, but I don't want him to see
ttyou.

Deanna pauses reflectively a moment, allowing Fredo to get
her shoes on.

<b>ttttDEANNA
</b>ttWhat beats me, is how you guys
ttcould be brothers.  You musta been
ttyour Mother's rotten egg.

She kicks off the shoes, giggling, and runs toward a waiter.

<b>ttttDEANNA
</b>ttt(lifting a glass of champagne)
ttYoung man, young man...thank you,
ttyoung man.

<b>ttttWAITER
</b>ttt(impressed)
ttExcuse me, but aren't you...

</b>ttYes, you saw me in the movies, Good

ttthan my shoes!

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttGoddamn bitch.

<b>ttttDEANNA
</b>ttRelax, Freddie honey.  Come dance
ttwith me.

She extends her hand to him.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttListen, Michael's got a lot of nice
ttpeople here.  Friends of Kay's.
ttHe'll never forgive me if you ruin
tthis party.

<b>ttttDEANNA
</b>ttI hate to see you cringe in front
ttof him.  How come you're so scared
ttof your own kid brother?

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttHe's the head of the family.

Disgusted, she turns around, and heads toward the music.

<b>ttttDEANNA
</b>ttDon't follow me!

<b>EXT. TAHOE LAWN AND TABLES - MED. SHOT - DAY
</b>
Rushing through the tables, waving an arm jangling with gold
jewelry, and carrying several gift-wrapped packages, is a
hardened and aging CONNIE CORLEONE.  She is followed by a
blond, and wrinkled-handsome escort named MERLE.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttMama...Mama!  Here I am!

She throws her arms around her Mother, who returns the
affection somewhat reproachfully.

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttConstanzia.  We expected you last
ttweek; we sent the car to pick you
ttup at the airport last week.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttI know, it was chaos; but anyway,

tttMerle's arms)
ttThis is for my Mama.  You remember
ttMerle?

ttYes, thank you.

<b>ttttCONNIE

ttwith him and I can't wait on line.

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttYou go see your children first, and
ttthen you wait to see your brother
ttlike everybody else.

<b>EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY
</b>
A porch-like foyer of the boathouse, where a group of five
or six men wait, some nervously.  Some sit, and some pace.

<b>MED. CLOSE VIEW
</b>
on one of these men, FRANKIE PENTANGELI, approaching his
sixties, with gray hair (the little of it left).  He's a bit
scruffy, this morning's shave of his white beard is not
perfect, and he seems tired.  He is accompanied by an
associate-bodyguard, WILLY CICCI; thin and dark, and also
dressed up for the occasion.  Frankie tries to get the
attention of one of the waiters; a college-groomed young man
in white sports jacket and black bow-tie.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttHey, kid!  You got any red wine?

<b>ttttWAITER
</b>ttt(offering the tray)
ttOnly champagne and cocktails.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttForget it...

Finally, he sees someone he recognizes, Fredo, and shouts
out in a husky voice:

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttFredo!  Sonuvabitch.  You look great.

Fredo squints in his direction; finally recognizes him.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttWho's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie
tt&quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were
ttnever coming West.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttt(affectionately)
ttGotta check up on my boys.  Hey,
ttwhat's with the food?  Some kid in
tta white jacket brings me a ritz
ttcracker with some chopped liver.
tt'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a
ttpeas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker
ttwith chopped liver.' Go get me a
ttsalami sandwich and a glass of wine
ttor I'll send you and your white
ttjacket to the dry cleaners!

They get a good laugh at this fresh breath of New York.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttGee, Frankie, it's good to see you.
ttReminds me of old times.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttYou remember Willy Cicci, don't
ttyou, Freddie?  We was all together
ttwith the old man Clemenza in
ttBrooklyn... before...uh...

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttWe were all upset about that.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttThat's what I'm here to talk to

ttC'mon, I see what I can do.

<b>EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - MED. VIEW - DAY
</b>
The orchestra wears white summer sportcoats and black tuxedo
slacks as they play a tango behind monogrammed music stands.
A professional dance team, probably imported from Vegas,
dance the tango for the excited guests.

<b>INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY
</b>
A large and very beautiful room overlooking the lake.  It is
dominated by an enormous bar, behind which stands ALBERT
NERI, discreetly in the background.

MICHAEL CORLEONE sits on a large sofa, his back to us.
Standing to one side is a tired and somewhat uneasy TOM
HAGEN.  Standing before Michael is SANDRA CORLEONE, Sonny's
widow; her daughter, one of the twins, FRANCESCA CORLEONE,
and a handsome young man of twenty, GARDNER SHAW.

<b>ttttSANDRA
</b>ttMichael, this is Gardner Shaw.
ttFrancesca and he have been seeing
tteach other for six months now.
ttGardner, this is Francie's Uncle
ttMichael.

<b>ttttGARDNER
</b>ttt(a little nervous)
ttI've heard a lot about you, Mr.
ttCorleone.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>ttSit down.  Francie.

The couple sit themselves on the sofa opposite Michael.

<b>ttttSANDRA
</b>ttThey would like to set an engagement
ttdate, and...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttLet them speak for themselves.

VIEW ON MICHAEL, calm, thoughtful.  One can tell that he has
special affection for his niece.

<b>ttttFRANCESCA
</b>ttWe love each other, Uncle Michael.
ttAnd, we want to be married.  I came
ttto ask for your blessing.

There is a loud KNOCKING on the door; then Fredo's voice.

<b>ttttFREDO (O.S.)
</b>ttHey, Mike...guess who's here?

Neri goes to answer it, cracks the door open.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttNot now, Freddie...

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttTell Mike Frankie 'Five-Angels' is
tthere.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttNot now...

Neri closes the door, and Michael looks at the nervous young
man.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttFrancesca is my oldest brother's
ttdaughter.  He died many years ago,
ttand ever since I've felt much more
ttof a father than an uncle.  I love
tther very much.  I'm pleased and

ttto come to me before going on with

<b>ttttGARDNER
</b>ttMy major is Fine Arts, sir.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHow will Fine Arts support your new

<b>ttttGARDNER
</b>ttIt's embarrassing to say, sir, but
ttI'm a major stockholder in the

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttNever be embarrassed by your wealth.
ttThis recent contempt for money is
ttstill another trick of the rich to
ttkeep the poor without it.
ttt(warmly)
ttOf course I give you my blessing.
ttLet's set the wedding soon...it

They all smile, and rise.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt...and take a few courses in
ttBusiness Administration just to be
tton the safe side!

They laugh; Michael moves toward them.  Francesca throws her
arms around him, and kisses her favorite uncle.  The flushed
young man shakes his hand heartily.

<b>ttttFRANCESCA
</b>ttThank you, Uncle Michael.

They all take their leave; Michael turns to Hagen.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttMake her dowry impressive.  He
ttcomes from a family who still
ttthinks an Italian bride goes
ttbarefoot.

<b>EXT. TAHOE SWIMMING POOLS AND HARBOR - DAY

Snapshots of a middle-aged man, handsome, Italian.  There is
something familiar about him.

<b>ttttNERI (O.S.)
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt...American wife and two small kids.
ttWe traced him and found that he's
ttin the country illegally, from
ttSicily...

Michael looks at another picture.  The same man.  Only
younger, and dressed in Sicilian shepherd's clothing.  We
remember him as FABRIZZIO...Michael's traitorous bodyguard
in Sicily.

<b>ttttNERI (O.S.)
</b>tt...came over around 1956.  Sponsored
ttby the Barzini Family.

Michael puts the pictures down.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt's him.  Fabrizzio.
ttt(almost to himself)
ttRevenge is a dish that tastes best
ttwhen it's cold.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttHow do you want me to handle it?

Michael glances at Hagen, who has been waiting in the room.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttLater.  Tom?

Hagen brings him a folder; then, as Michael glances through
it:

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI've cleared it through the
ttSenator's chief aide, a man named
ttTurnbull.  Turnbull's a heavy
ttgambler, and into us for over a
tthundred grand, so I figure his
ttinformation is reliable.

Neri moves to the bar, to prepare Michael a drink.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThe Senator can be set up; but he
ttthinks of himself as a clean
ttpolitician.  So it's got to be on
ttterms he can live with: campaign
ttcontribution, donation to a
ttcharitable cause that he controls,
ttthings like that.  If he gets even
ttthe inkling that you think you're
ttbuying him, he'll freeze up.
ttNevada's a funny state, they like
ttthings both ways here... All right.
ttTurnbull says the Senator will be
tthere at two-thirty, and he's been
ttprimed.  He knows you'll want to
ttmeet with him alone, and he knows
ttit's about the Tropicana's license.
ttAt any rate, he expects to be
ttintroduced around to some of the
ttinfluential people here today, and
ttgenerally treated as an ordinary
ttguest.  Just go light on him,
ttMikey, sometimes the biggest crooks
ttdon't like to think of themselves
ttas crooks...

Michael glances at Hagen, as though that last remark was
unnecessary.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI'm sorry; of course, you know that.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTwo-thirty.  That gives me time to
ttsee my boy.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttConnie's outside.

Michael doesn't want to see her.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI promised; she said it was urgent.

Michael nods.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttAll right.  Apologize to Pentangeli.

Neri opens the door; Hagen exits, and Connie steps in
impatiently, followed by Merle.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI said I would see my sister, alone.

<b>ttttMERLE
</b>ttI think this concerns me too.
ttt(taking a cigarette
tttfrom the dispenser)
ttYou don't, do you?

Connie steps forward, kisses Michael on the cheek.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttHow are you, honey?  You've met
ttMerle, haven't you.  He was with me
ttin Vegas.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI saw him with you.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttWe're going to Europe next week.  I
ttwant to get passage booked on the
ttQueen.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWhy do you come to me?  Why don't
ttyou go to a travel agent?

<b>ttttMERLE
</b>ttWe're going to get married first.

Michael is silent.  Then he rises, and moves to the window
overlooking the lake.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThe ink on your divorce isn't dry.
ttYour children see you on weekends;
ttyour oldest boy, Michael Francis...
ttwas in some trouble with the Reno
ttpolice over some petty theft that
ttyou don't even know about.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttMichael...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYou fly around the world with lazy
ttyoung men who don't have any love
ttfor you, and use you like a whore.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttYou're not my father!

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThen why do you come to me?

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttBecause I need MONEY!

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(softly)
ttConnie, I want to be reasonable
ttwith you.  You have a house here,
ttwith us.  You can live here with
ttyour kids...and you won't be
ttdeprived of anything.  I don't know
ttmuch about Merle; I don't know what
tthe does for a living; what he lives
tton.  Why don't you tell him marriage
ttis really out of the question; and
ttthat you can't see him any more.
ttHe'll understand.  But if you
ttdisobey me, and marry this pimp...it
ttwould disappoint me.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttIt was my father's money; and I'm
ttentitled to what I need.  Where is
ttTom Hagen?

She turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face
with Merle.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttAre you finished?

<b>ttttMERLE
</b>ttI think so.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThen out.

Merle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.

<b>EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - FULL VIEW - DAY
</b>
The orchestra has struck up a &quot;Paul Jones,&quot; where two
concentric circles of young people march in opposite
directions, until the music stops.  Then they take whomever
is opposite them as their new dance partner.

<b>VIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA
</b>
Francesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young
friends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the
water skis.  We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path
leading to a separate and more private boathouse.  A small
covered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men
step on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and
follow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his
business.

<b>CLOSE VIEW
</b>
Pentangeli has led Mama up to the dance floor, and is having
some difficulty with the orchestra.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttI can't believe that out of thirty
ttprofessional musicians, not one of
ttyou is Italian!
ttt(as the musicians laugh)
ttC'mon, give us a tarantella.

He waves his hands, conducting, and singing.  The piano
starts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet
starts to play &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel,&quot; and soon the rest of
the orchestra is playing that.  They look to Pentangeli for
approval.  Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a
handful of canapes.

<b>INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY
</b>
Rocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold
and wet of his boatride, to Michael.

The man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that
Neri should get him a drink.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttRocco, his friends must be hungry.
ttSee what you can do, but I'd like
ttto keep them away from the guests.

The older man, JOHNNY 'BLUE BOY' OLA, gestures to his
bodyguards, and they follow Lampone.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYou know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.
ttJohnny Ola.

<b>ttttOLA
</b>ttSure, I remember Tom from the old
ttdays.

Tom shakes hands with Ola, remembering him, and his
importance.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTom isn't going to sit in with us,
ttJohnny.  He only handles specific
ttareas of the family business.  Tom?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttSure, Mikey.

He gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain
silent, waiting for him to go before they talk.  It's clear
Tom doesn't want to be excluded.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttIf you need anything, just...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttJust tell Rocco I'm waiting.

Hagen nods and leaves.  As soon as the door closes:

<b>ttttOLA
</b>ttI just left our friend in Miami.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHow is his health?

<b>ttttOLA
</b>ttNot good.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIs there anything I can do; anything
ttI can send?

<b>ttttOLA
</b>ttHe appreciates your concern,
ttMichael, and your respect.

There's a KNOCK on the door; a moment, and then Rocco
quietly enters and takes his place without disturbing the
conversation.

<b>ttttOLA
</b>ttThe hotel's registered owners are
ttone Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney
ttBarclay, both Beverly Hills
ttattorneys.  In reality it's split
ttbetween the Old Lakeville Road
ttGroup from Cleveland, and our
ttfriend in Miami.  He takes care of
ttothers outside the country, you
ttknow who I mean.  Meyer Klingman
ttruns the store, and does all right,
ttbut I've been instructed to tell
ttyou, that if you move him out, our
ttfriend in Miami will go along with
ttyou.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHe's very kind, tell him it's
ttappreciated.  I'm sure it will be
ttprofitable all the way around.

<b>ttttOLA
</b>ttHe always makes money for his
ttpartners.  One by one, our old
ttfriends are gone.  Death, natural
ttor not, prison, deported.  Our
ttfriend in Miami is the only one
ttleft, because he always made money
ttfor his partners.

The door opens suddenly, and standing there in his white
Communion suit, is Michael's boy Anthony.  A moment later,
Kay appears, and takes the boy's hand.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAnthony, Daddy's busy.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(rising)
ttThis is my boy, and my wife.  Mr.
ttJohn Ola of Miami.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI'm sorry, Michael.  Senator
ttGeary's here, and Mr. and Mrs.
ttBarrett wanted to thank you before
ttthey left.  Won't you join us, Mr.
ttOla?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttMr. Ola's just leaving, Kay.
ttPlease tell the Senator I won't be
tta minute.

Pause; she stands there a moment.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttKay.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYes, Michael.

<b>EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY
</b>
Kay closes the door.  It seems as though Michael has violated
some sort of promise to her by having this man here today.
She looks up toward the first boathouse.

<b>WHAT SHE SEES:
</b>
The covered launch, and Ola's three bodyguards, eating while
they wait.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
Anthony runs away from her, heading toward the house.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAnthony!
ttt(she runs after him)
ttAnthony, where are you going?

Moodily, the boy stops, turns, and walks back to his table
of honor without answering her.

<b>EXT. TAHOE TABLES AND PAVILION - VIEW ON THE PAVILION - DAY
</b>
The orchestra has taken its break; now two couples in formal
dress are performing the Quartet from Rigoletto.

<b>VIEW ON HAGEN
</b>
sitting by himself, a little down, having a drink.  He's
waiting for Michael to re-summon him.  SANDRA, Sonny's
widow, sits opposite him.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWhere's my wife?

<b>ttttSANDRA
</b>ttWith Mama, putting the baby to
ttsleep.  Francesca's very happy.
ttMichael was kind to her.  She
ttidolizes him.
ttt(pause; she looks at
ttta despondent Hagen)
ttThe children are all out in the
ttspeedboat.  I'm going to my house.

Sandra gets up, still an attractive woman, and walks alone
to the back path that leads to her home on the estate.

<b>VIEW ON THE PAVILION
</b>
The returned orchestra strikes a big, show-biz chord,
intended to command the guests' attention.

The orchestra LEADER raises his hands for silence, and makes
an announcement over the P.A. system.

<b>ttttMAESTRO
</b>ttLadies and gentlemen, a most
ttdistinguished guest would like to
ttsay a few words: Senator and Mrs.
ttPat Geary of the state of Nevada!

A big hand, as the smiling SENATOR introduces his WIFE by
holding her arm up to the crowd, and then proceeds alone to
the bandstand.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
Michael stands with Kay and Mrs. Geary.  The Senator's
presence seems to be a statement of political and social
status.

A little distance away, his beautiful son Anthony sits
quietly, in an unmistakably morose mood.

<b>INT. TAHOE - SANDRA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
We HEAR the applause and whistles echoing in the distance.
Sandra stands in her bedroom, looking at the door.  We SEE a
photograph of SONNY, and also one of their wedding.

A moment goes by, and then Tom Hagen enters, closing the
door behind him.

We begin to HEAR Senator Geary's amplified voice resounding
over the lake.  Hagen moves to Sandra.  She takes him in her
arms, comforting, holding his head against her full breast.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttHe doesn't want my help any more.
ttHe doesn't need it.

<b>ttttSANDRA
</b>ttWe don't know that's true, he never
ttsaid that.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI can feel it in the way he talks
ttto me.

He moves to the dresser; pours himself a drink.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttJust now when Johnny Ola showed up,
tthe asked me to leave them alone.
ttOla is Hyman Roth's Sicilian
ttcontact.  I was on the inside of
ttten, twenty meetings with him.  But
tttoday Mike asked me to leave, like
ttan outsider.

<b>ttttSANDRA
</b>ttTalk to him.  Tell him how you feel.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttIt's as though he blames me for the
ttground the family lost when I was
ttConsigliere to Sonny.

Sandra pulls Hagen to her, and kisses him passionately on
the mouth.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI love Michael, I want to help him,
ttbe close to him.  I don't want to
ttend up a third string lawyer making
ttproperty settlements for the hotels.

Sandra knows he needs her.  Slowly she begins to undress.

<b>ttttSANDRA
</b>ttWe have a little time now.

<b>EXT. THE PAVILION - VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY - DAY

ttt(he holds a check in
ttthis hand)
tt...made to the University in the
ttname of Anthony Vito Corleone.
ttThank you, Mr. and Mrs. Michael
ttCorleone.

Applause.  Senator Geary returns the microphone to the
Maestro who adds:

<b>ttttMAESTRO
</b>ttAnd now, the Nevada Boys' Choir
tthave prepared a special thank you
ttfor Mr. Michael Corleone.

He turns to a small Choir Master, who leads the Boys' Choir
in a choral arrangement of &quot;MR. WONDERFUL.&quot;

<b>VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY
</b>
shaking hands with Michael, as Press Photographers snap
pictures, showing the check; showing a special award of
Gratitude from the State; Mrs. Corleone and Mrs. Geary; all
together; Michael and his son; Senator Geary and Michael's
son; and on and on.  In the midst of this:

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttWhere can we meet alone?

Michael indicates the boathouse a distance away, where Neri
seems to be waiting for them.  Then Michael leans to Rocco:

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttFind Hagen.

Rocco sets off; as more pictures are taken, and the:

<b>BOYS' CHOIR
</b>
sings its lovely arrangement of &quot;Mr. Wonderful.&quot;

<b>INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY
</b>
Michael, the Senator, Neri and Rocco make a group in the
dark, large room.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt was very kind of you to come to
ttmy home on this occasion, Senator.
ttMy wife has been very concerned
ttwith making a good impression on
ttthe people who are our neighbors,
ttand your appearance here has made
tther very happy.  If I can ever
ttperform a service for you, you only
tthave to ask.

The door opens, and Hagen sheepishly makes his way in.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttMy lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged
ttthis all through your man Turnbull.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttI thought we would meet alone.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI trust these men with my life.
ttThey are my right arms; I cannot
ttinsult them by sending them away.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttt(taking out some medication)
ttSome water.

He addresses that to Neri, who resentfully goes to fetch the
Senator a glass of water.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttAlright, Corleone.  I'm going to be
ttvery frank with you.  Maybe more
ttfrank than any man in my position
tthas ever spoken to you before.

Michael nods, indicating that he should do so.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttThe Corleone family controls two
ttmajor hotels in Vegas; one in Reno.
ttThe licenses were grandfathered in,
ttso you had no difficulties with the

tttNeri and swallows his pills)
tt...that you're planning to move in
tton the Tropicana.  In another week
ttor so you'll move Klingman out,
ttwhich leaves you with only one

ttis now in Klingman's name.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTurnbull is a good man.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttLet's forget the bullshit, I don't

ttto five percent of the gross...

Michael is taken aback; he looks at Hagen.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>tt...of all three Corleone hotels.

Hagen is frustrated; all his information was wrong.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttSenator Geary, I speak to you as a
ttbusinessman who has made a large
ttinvestment in your state.  I have
ttmade that state my home; plan to
ttraise my children here.  The
ttlicense fee from the Gambling

ttdollars; why would I ever consider
ttpaying more?

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttI'm going to squeeze you, Corleone,

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttWe're all part of the same

He is almost out the door.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttSenator...

Geary turns back.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttMy offer is this.  Nothing...not
tteven the thousand dollars for the
ttGaming Commission, which I'd
ttappreciate if you would put up
ttpersonally.

Geary returns Michael's hard look; then laughs and leaves.
Slowly Michael turns to Hagen.

<b>VIEW ON HAGEN
</b>
embarrassed at being so off the mark.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt's all right, Tom, we'll talk

<b>EXT. THE PAVILION - NIGHT
</b>
Now the light has faltered, and the young waiters have put
up the night lights.  The tables are all properly set for
dinner, with candles on each one.

The orchestra is playing quiet, unobtrusive dinner music,
and many of the guests have begun to help themselves to the
impressive buffet, under a party tent.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
Michael sits at a large table with Kay, his son Anthony,
Mama, Hagen and TERESA, Connie and Merle' Fredo and Deanna,

ttWhen do we talk?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttAfter dinner.

By now, the conversation has become exclusively Sicilian,
with Merle and Deanna, looking from side to side like in a
tennis match.  Finally, Kay, to be polite:

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAnthony, you were talking to Mr.

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttHis name is &quot;Five-Angels.&quot;

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttYeah, the kid and me talked Sicilian.
ttA one-way conversation!

<b>INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Pentangeli is angry; but because it is Michael he is talking
to, he keeps his voice low and represses his desire to shout.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttSure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart
ttattack, but the Rosato Brothers

<b>INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - 1915 - NIGHT
</b>
VITO CORLEONE is a shy young man of 23, holding his hat in
his hand, being led down the crowded aisle of this Italian
Vaudeville theatre by an energetic and fulfilled GENCO
ABBANDANDO, his friend in America.  This entire sequence is
played in Sicilian.

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttCome on, you've got to see her!

<b>VIEW ON THE STAGE
</b>
A tattered melodrama is in progress in Neapolitan.  The sets
are two-dimensional, and flap whenever there's an entrance
or exit.

The hero, PEPPINO, is weeping as he sings about how he's
left his Mother in Italy, while he is in this new country,
America.

<b>VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE
</b>
All poor, Italo-Americans.  Genco finds a few seats, and
leads Vito to them, stepping on a few shoes in the process.
They have barely come to their seats, when an excited Genco
nudges Vito, and points to the stage.  People shout that
they should sit down.

<b>VIEW ON THE STAGE
</b>
There is a knock on the door, and a young girl enters,
delivering a letter to Peppino in his tenement in America.
The girl is pretty; and obviously the object of Genco's
affection.  The letter brings bad news.  Peppino's Mother is
dead.  He weeps, and sings the final song, which most of the
audience knows: SENZA MAMMA.

<b>VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE
</b>
Genco is enthralled with the young actress.  The people in
the audience are singing along with Peppino.

<b>VIEW ON THE STAGE
</b>
The actress, object of Genco's affection, makes a dramatic
exit.

<b>VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE
</b>
Genco pulls on Vito's jacket, indicating that now that his
love is offstage, they should leave.  Vito rises with him,
and they make their way all the way down the aisle.

<b>INT. BACKSTAGE THEATRE - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
Genco hurrying down the backstage corridor, hoping to catch
a glimpse of the actress.  He is followed by Vito.  Suddenly,
Genco stops short.

<b>GENCO'S VIEW
</b>
A heavy-set, fierce looking Italian wearing an expensive
light-colored suit and a cream colored fedora.  This is
FANUCCI.  He is discussing a business matter with the
theatre IMPRESARIO; a large, strong looking man, who is
sweating nonetheless.  He doesn't seem to be giving in to
Fanucci.  He holds a locked strongbox.

<b>VIEW ON VITO
</b>
watching.  The two men argue in Italian.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
The young ACTRESS crosses into the area, unaware of the
difficulties.  The impresario sees her, and frightened,
motions that she should keep away.

<b>ttttIMPRESARIO
</b>ttCarla!

But Fanucci grabs her easily by her slender wrist, and with
lightning speed, produces a knife which he holds against her
cheek.  The impresario wrings his hands in agony.

<b>ttttIMPRESARIO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttNo...please, not my daughter.

Whereupon he begins to unlock the box which holds the
receipts for the night's box-office.

hiding, watching.  At first, Genco is enraged, as though he
would rush up to help his enamorata.

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttThe Black Hand.

Then he backs away.  Vito looks at him shocked and
disappointed in this cowardly behavior.  Genco shakes his
head, and points, as though to say that where Fanucci is
concerned, there is nothing to be done.

as though he's had a near escape.

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttI know what you are thinking,
ttVitone, but you don't understand

</b>ttFor you, she is beautiful.  For me,
ttthere is only my wife!

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttI know.  That's why I brought you
ttwith me!

Genco embraces his good friend, and they laughingly walk
down the alley.

The stage door opens, and Fanucci exits, a sinister figure
in white, moving down the alley just in front of them, into
the night.

The two friends hold their breath, until he disappears.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MOVING VIEW - DAY
</b>
Vito moves through the street, carrying groceries that he is
to deliver.

It is cold, and so vendors are huddled around fires they
have lit in old cans and drums.

He turns up an alleyway, and then stops.

<b>VIEW UP THE ALLEY
</b>
With great strength, Fanucci lifts one of them up into the
air and throws him down hard to the concrete; but another,
holding onto his back, manages to produce a switchblade
knife and awkwardly reaching around from behind the moving
man, slits Fanucci's throat from one side to the other.

Fanucci groans like some great hurt animal.  Blood pours
from the deep, smile-like slit in his throat.

He throws the young man off his back.

<b>VIEW ON VITO
</b>
stepping back in the alley.

<b>VIEW ON FANUCCI

He takes off his white fedora, and runs down the alley
toward Vito, catching the flowing blood in his hat.

The young attackers scurry off in various directions.

A tiny shop featuring imported food: trays of cured meats,
prosciutto, copagole, mortadella lies on the counter covered
with netting to keep away the thousands of flies.

Olive oil is sold in bulk, as well as wine, cheese and bacala.

Genco works here for his father, and is busy slicing paper
thin prosciutto for a customer, by hand.  Vito works in the
back as a stock clerk.

Finished with his customer, Genco moves to his friend.

A young man, one of those who had tried to kill Fanucci,
runs down an alleyway, breathlessly.  Then he stops, and
looks behind himself.  Whoever was following him is gone.
He turns and walks ahead.  Then the mammoth, white-suited
figure of Fanucci leaps down before him from the fire-escape.
He grins at the young man, and then raises his neck, showing
the gruesome wound that marks his throat.

He takes out his pistol and fires point-blank at his attacker.

through the silent ritual of preparing a simple meal for him.
He sits and eats quietly.

Vito and Carmella enter the darkened bedroom, and approach a

Immediately, Vito turns back to his work, and Signor
Abbandando moves to Fanucci with a sigh.

Vito notices the two men talking quietly at one side of the
store, while he goes about his work.  Genco works his way
closer to his friend.

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttWhat did I tell you.  The one who
ttcut him was found in an alley.  And

Vito looks at him a while, as the old man struggles to tell
him.

The old man nods, regretfully.

other side of the air shaft which separates their apartments.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttHey Paisan!  Hold this for me until

Automatically Vito reaches over to the empty space at the
air shaft, and takes the bundle of rags.  Clemenza's round
face is strained and urgent, obviously in some kind of
trouble.  Suddenly, he closes the window and there is
activity that we cannot see in the other apartment.

Vito looks to his wife, and then closes the window and
window dressing and takes the bundle into a private part of
his kitchen and begins to unwrap it.

<b>WHAT HE SEES:

handles a couple of them and stands aside so Clemenza can
enter her apartment.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttI don't know which one I like best.

She holds the dresses against her body, Clemenza approving
of each one; and then she goes to her purse and takes out
five singles and gives them to him.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttYou'd look beautiful in all of
ttthese.  You should buy at least two.

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttAre you kidding?  My husband will
ttkill me if he knows I paid five
ttdollars for one dress.

She holds one up, then another.  She is torn.  Clemenza
shakes his head and straightens the dress on her body.  His
hand brushes her arm; she looks at him smiling.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttYou can have two for five.

She smiles back.

<b>EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY
</b>
Clemenza jumps down the stairs, and out to the middle of the
street, where Vito and Tessio are waiting in the car with
some of the stock.

<b>ttttTESSIO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttWhat took so long?

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttShe couldn't decide.

Tessio and Clemenza each take more armsful of dresses and
divide the neighborhood.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttVito, take the rest of the stock
ttover to Dandine's warehouse; he'll
ttmove it to a wholesaler.

The three part.  Vito drives the truck off.

<b>MOVING VIEW
</b>
Vito drives the truck through the downtown streets; he turns
a corner and stops for a light.

Suddenly, to his left, he sees the formidable figure of
Fanucci.

He grabs young Corleone by the shoulder.

frightening, revealing the large circular scar, now healed.

<b>ttttFANUCCI
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttAhhh, young fellow.  People tell me
ttyou're rich, you and your two

Vito says nothing.  Fanucci thumbs through the stock.

ttThis is my neighborhood.  You and
ttyour friends have to show me a
ttlittle respect, ah?  This truck you

Fanucci takes a few of the dresses.

</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttI understand each of you cleared

Vito smiles at him and nods.

</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttOtherwise the police will come to

ttOf course, if my information as to

</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttYou have respect.  A fine thing in
ttthe young.  Next time, speak to me
ttfirst, eh?  Perhaps I can help you

Fanucci turns with the dresses draped over his arms, waving
to Vito.

Vito throws the truck in gear, and drives off.

</b>
We know that throughout this encounter he has seethed with
an icy rage.

<b>ttttTESSIO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttWhat can we do?

Clemenza doesn't even bother checking for Vito's opinion.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttThey say Fanucci has a license from
ttMaranzalla himself to work this
ttneighborhood.

<b>ttttVITO

ttIf you like, why not give me fifty

</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttI'll reason with him.  Leave

Tessio and Clemenza regard him suspiciously.

ttI never lie to people I've accepted

Clemenza, irritated, makes a large belch, and washes his
food down with wine.

ttOur driver has drunk too much wine.

Both Clemenza and Tessio are impressed with their young
friend; his willingness to risk his life on his perception
of the situation.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
A ten piece Italian street band plays in front of the church
to commemorate the first night of the Festa di San Gennaro.
People swarm in crowds, delighted by the music, as out of
the church four men carry the statue of San Gennaro down to
the street.

<b>MOVING VIEW
</b>
Clemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along
the street: sausage cooking on an open fire; pork livers and
sweetbeards.  He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated
gesture when the vendor expects to be paid.  He crosses to a
church-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and
slaps a dollar on a number.  Standing next to him is Vito;
they embrace.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttt (quietly)
ttAll three daughters are at church;
tthe is alone.  It's important that
ttyou let his neighbors see you leave.
ttTessio has broken the latch on the
ttskylight of his building.

The wheel stops; they both lose.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttt(English)
ttSee, Brother Carmello, even the
ttchurch makes numbers.

<b>ttttPRIEST
</b>ttt(English)
ttIt's only the way we collect that's
ttdifferent.

Vito has left while Clemenza jokes with the Priest.

<b>EXT. FESTA STREET - NIGHT
</b>
Vito passes the booths of food, crossing toward a small and
dark club.

<b>INT. SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
We can still HEAR the crowds and music of the festa.  Vito
enters; the club is empty, except for the large white figure
sitting alone at a small table.  Fanucci barely acknowledges
Vito as he joins him.

Without a word, Vito counts out two hundred dollars on the
table.  Fanucci looks, then takes off his fedora and puts it
on the table over the money.

<b>ttttFANUCCI
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttI think there's only two hundred
ttdollars under my hat.
ttt(he peeks)
ttI'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.

ttt(he takes the two

<b>EXT. FESTA STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
By now the musicians have left, but still families are
walking the street, and stopping at the booths.

Fanucci stands there a moment; he is known by everyone, and
considers himself highly loved.

Then Fanucci begins the walk through the festa, on his way
home.

<b>EXT. ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
Vito silently moves along the rooftop; paralleling Fanucci's
walk.

We HEAR the sounds of the festa, and every so often catch a
glimpse of the patterned lights, and the crowds below.

<b>EXT. FESTA STREETS - MOVING VIEW ON FANUCCI - NIGHT
</b>
walking through the crowded streets.  The statue of San
Gennaro is arranged in some midnight religious ceremony.

The VIEW LIFTS UP, to the rooftops.

<b>EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
</b>
Vito makes the leap that separates two buildings; then
crosses toward the large skylight in the center of the
building.

<b>EXT. THE STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
The procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys;
and the glittering Monstrance, something of an altar carried
out into the streets.

The priest begins this nocturnal service, as the crowds in
the street kneel down in prayer.

<b>INT. FANUCCI'S BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Fanucci unlocks the door to his building; we can HEAR the
services in the background.

<b>EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</b>
Vito tries the trap door on the roof; it is stuck firmly
shut; despite Clemenza's instructions.  He struggles with
it, but no luck.

From the distance, the Choir begins to Latin.  Vito moves
around the skylight, to an identical trap, tries this one;
it opens.

<b>EXT. THE MONSTRANCE - MED. VIEW ON THE PRIEST - NIGHT
</b>
performing the services in Latin.  The ten altar boys are in
attendance.

<b>EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</b>
Vito reaches down into the trap, and pulls out the newly
oiled gun that has been left for him.  He slides down into
the building.

<b>INT. FANUCCI'S HALLWAY - DOWN ANGLE - NIGHT
</b>
Fanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud, heavy steps.
An OLD WOMAN on one of the flights sees him, and immediately
moves to her apartment.

<b>ttttFANUCCI
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttWhat's the matter, Signora?  You
ttdon't say 'good evening'?

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
tt'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci.

She quickly disappears behind her door.  Fanucci laughs,
continues up, singing to himself.  The MASS outside is
always in evidence.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Vito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear
door open.  He slips in, and makes his way past the open
windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the
Mass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut.

He moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.

<b>WHAT HE SEES:
</b>
Three young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking.

<b>VIEW ON VITO
</b>
A slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside
to the alley where he can look into the apartment.

<b>ANOTHER VIEW
</b>
Fanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters.

<b>CLOSE VIEW ON VITO
</b>
He begins to wrap the gun.

<b>VIEW ON THE DAUGHTERS
</b>
Their father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious
gift he has bought for each.

<b>CLOSE ON THE GUN
</b>
wrapped in this primitive method of a silencer.  The VIEW
TILTS to Vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all
or none of them.  Then something catches his eye.

<b>WHAT HE SEES:
</b>
A small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes
up to him and rubs itself against him.  Vito rubs the
animal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its
confidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's
apartment.

He steps back, holding the gun.  We HEAR some Italian
shouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of
the thumping footsteps of Fanucci.

<b>VIEW ON VITO
</b>
holding the wrapped gun, waiting.

<b>WHAT HE SEES:
</b>
The white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in
Italian as he throws the cat out.

<b>VIEW ON VITO
</b>
squeezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST
resounding in the building.

<b>VIEW ON FANUCCI
</b>
He holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying
to reach for his gun.  The force of his struggle has torn
the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose.  His gun
is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront
of his stomach.  Carefully, as if plunging a needle into
this vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet.

Fanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a
terrible groan.  We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside
the apartment.

Vito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred,
quickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek.
Now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire,
literally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the
ground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.

<b>EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
Vito moves like a cat along the rooftops; we HEAR the
conclusion of the Mass down below.

<b>CLOSE ON VITO
</b>
Pausing; we can SEE the great spectacle of lights and
candles on the streets below.

He empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against
the side of the roof ledge.  He reverses it in his hand, and
breaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney.
He smashes it again, and the pistol breaks into barrel and
handle, two separate pieces.

He then moves along the rooftop, dropping the two separate
fragments into various air shafts.

<b>EXT. THE STREET PROCESSION - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
The Priest, having completed the ceremony, follows as the
Monstrance is carried off through the streets, as the Choir
sings.

<b>EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito is a dark figure, moving with agility across the
rooftops.

</b>
Vito's wife; her baby and several friends and neighbors sit
happily on the front stoop of their tenement.  Some of the
men drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR
the music and night sounds of the Festa.

A neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song.

Quietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance
from his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of
wine, and listens to the song.

</b>
<b>INT. ANTHONY'S TAHOE ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The room is large, lit from the outside by a bright evening.
We can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built
along the wall.  We see the dark figure of Michael Corleone
enter the room and approach the bed where his son Anthony
lies curled in messy blankets.  Michael quietly arranges his
small hands and feet and covers the little boy.  Suddenly,
Anthony turns, his eyes open.  He is staring, perfectly
awake, at his father.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttCan't you sleep?

No answer.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttAre you alright?

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttMICHAEL

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttI got lots of presents.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttDo you like them?

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttI didn't know the people who gave
ttthem to me.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThey were friends.

He kisses his boy, and then turns.

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttDid you see my present for you?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo, where is it?

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttOn your pillow.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI'm leaving very early tomorrow,
ttbefore you wake up.

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttI know.  How long will you be gone?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttJust a few days.

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttWill you take me?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI can't.

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttWhy do you have to go?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTo do business.

<b>ttttANTHONY
</b>ttI can help you.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttSome day you will.

Michael kisses him again.

<b>INT. MICHAEL-KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The room is lit from a small night lamp on Michael's side of
the large bed.

Kay is huddled in blankets, asleep.  Michael closes the door
to his room, moves to his side of the bed, and glances down
to the pillow.

<b>VIEW ON THE PILLOW
</b>
is a child's drawing of a long limousine, with a man in a
hat sitting in the back seat.

An arrow pointing to him is marked &quot;DAD.&quot; Under it, a nine
year old's handwriting says: &quot;Do you like it?  Check YES __
I liked it or NO __ I didn't like it.&quot; Michael turns,
looking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he
places a check next to &quot;YES.&quot;

He starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay
turns, almost in her sleep:

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttMichael?  Why are the drapes open?

His eyes dart back to the curved, beautifully leaded windows
of the room.  The DRAPES are opened.  Then, without a
second's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding
his son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep
across the windows; glass shattering all over the room.

Kay screams out; rising, still half-asleep.  Michael crawls
toward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him.

Then, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the
shouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as
guards with flashlights come running.

Michael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived,
and then gently:

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttGo with the kids.

<b>EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT
</b>
Suddenly, the great floodlights are turned on, bathing lawns
in an intense blue light.

Groups of ordinarily dressed security men drawn in from all
directions; a state of confusion prevails.  There is no sign
of the attackers.

<b>VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE
</b>
Michael is joined by Rocco Lampone, his gun drawn.

<b>ttttROCCO
</b>ttThey're still on the property.
ttMaybe you better stay inside.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttKeep them alive.

Six men take up posts by Michael's house.

<b>ttttROCCO
</b>ttWe'll try.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt's important.

He returns inside.

<b>EXT. MAIN GATE AND KENNELS - NIGHT
</b>
The character of the summer estate has changed: bright
floodlights illuminate the main points of entry: the main
gate; the waterway; the stone wall that encompasses the
estate on all sides.

Several men with flashlights reinforce the guard at the main
gate.

<b>FULL VIEW
</b>
Off in the distance, we see another group of men with
flashlights combing the waterline.  We hear indistinguishable
shouts.

<b>VIEW ON THE KENNELS
</b>
The wire gates are opened, and the trained dogs go out
yelping into the outer edge of the estate.

<b>ROOFTOP
</b>
One of Rocco's men turns the large floodlight scanning
darkened forest areas, where men could hide.

<b>MOVING VIEW
</b>
Men with flashlights and dogs.  Moving through the dark areas.

<b>LOOSE VIEW
</b>
A small Corleone launch, with a bright spotlight slowly
cruises the boundaries of the estate.  We SEE the silhouette
of men with guns, quietly waiting and watching.

<b>EXT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Some of the bodyguards by the shattered windows of Michael's
bedroom.

The curtains are drawn from inside.

<b>INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Kay, the children, and some women servants have come down
from the various rooms into the central living area, that
can be most easily secured.  The little girl is still
asleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with
their blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a
central room.

Michael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt will be all right.  We were lucky.

She says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels
over the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in.  She
holds her young daughter in her arms.

The door opens, and Rocco enters.  He quickly realizes he is
holding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and
puts it away.  Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance
away from Kay.

<b>ttttROCCO
</b>ttYour family all seem to be okay in
ttthe other houses; your Mother's
ttstill sleeping.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttAnd?

<b>ttttROCCO

</b>ttGoddamn you!  You're all nuts here,
ttI'm not goin' to calm down...

<b>MICHAEL'S VIEW
</b>
Through the door, that Rocco opens.

Deanna, in her nightgown, has been frightened by the
gunshots; while Fredo in his bathrobe, tries to get her back
into the house.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttDeanna, will you get back into the

<b>EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT
</b>
Michael walks the short distance from his house, to the
boathouse where he conducts his business away from his family.

A small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the
walk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away.
It gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his
compound, followed by teams of Secret Service men.

The boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily
wakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure
where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of
emergency.

<b>FULL VIEW
</b>
In the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with
their lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the
estate.

<b>INT. THE BOATHOUSE - EMPTY VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
Michael alone in the great room.  He moves to a walk-in
safe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it.
He takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket;
there's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters.  He had been
asleep, and has quickly thrown on a robe.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttSit down, Tom.

<b>EXT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
From outside the leaded windows, a disoriented Hagen sits
down; Michael starts to talk to him; obviously about
something very serious.

The patrol securing the boathouse, walk past the window.
Michael says something to Tom, who rises, and pulls the
drapes, obscuring OUR VIEW.

<b>INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Michael talks intimately to Tom.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThere's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.
ttI know that's upset you in the
ttpast; and you've felt that it was
ttbecause of some lack of trust or
ttconfidence.  But it is because I do
tttrust you that I've kept so much
ttsecret from you.  It's precisely
ttthat at this moment, you are the
ttonly one that I can completely
tttrust.  In time, you'll understand
tteverything.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt(nods with this statement)
ttBut your people... Neri... Rocco;
ttyou don't think...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo, I have confidence in their
ttloyalty... but this is life and
ttdeath, and Tom, you are my brother.

Hagen in very moved.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttMikey, I hoped...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo Tom, just listen.  All my people
ttare businessmen; their loyalty is
ttbased on that.  One thing I learned
ttfrom my father is to try to think
ttas the people around you think...and
tton that basis, anything is possible.
ttFredo has a good heart, but he is
ttweak...and stupid, and stupid
ttpeople are the most dangerous of
ttall.  I've kept you out of things,
ttTom, because I've always known that
ttyour instincts were legitimate, and
ttI wanted you to know very little of
ttthings that would make you an
ttaccomplice, for your own protection.
ttI never blamed you for the setbacks
ttthe family took under Sonny; I know
ttyou were in a position of limited
ttpower, and you did your best to
ttadvise and caution him.  What I am
ttsaying is that now, for how long I
ttdo not know, you will be the Don.
ttIf what I think has happened is
tttrue; I will leave tonight, and
ttabsolutely no one will know how to
ttcontact me.  And even you are not
ttto try to reach me unless it is
ttabsolutely necessary.  I give you
ttcomplete power: over Neri... Fredo,
tteveryone.  I am trusting you with
ttthe lives of my wife and children,
ttand the future of this family,
ttsolely resting on your judgment and
tttalent.

<b>VIEW ON HAGEN
</b>
A man who has steadily declined over the last five years,
realizing that total power and responsibility is being
placed on him.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt...But Tom, you must know that I do
ttthis only because I believe you are
ttthe only one who is capable of
tttaking over for me.

<b>VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
taking out the envelope.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI've prepared this; have had it for
ttover a month.  It won't explain
tteverything; but indicates where I
ttwill be, so in a sense, it is my
ttlife.
ttt(he hands the envelope
tttto Hagen)
ttAlso, there are three tasks that
ttmust be executed immediately.  Pop
ttwould have given those to Luca --
ttYou knew Pop as well as anyone, act
ttas though you were him.  It
ttdiscusses Kay as well; that will be
ttthe most difficult.  The men who
tttried to kill me tonight, will
ttnever leave the estate.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWill we...be able to get who
ttordered it out of them?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI don't think so.  Unless I'm very
ttwrong...they're already dead.
ttKilled by someone inside...very
ttfrightened that they botched it.
ttThat's why I am going to disappear
ttin a few minutes, and leave
tteverything to you.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttBut if you're wrong...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIf I'm wrong...

There is a KNOCK on the door.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt...I don't think I'm wrong.
ttt(he indicates the knock)
ttYes.

The door opens; it is Rocco; Michael rises, after making a
knowing glance toward Tom, and moves to talk quietly to a
frightened and agitated Rocco.

<b>EXT. STONE WALL AND STREAM - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
A group of men with flashlights and guns lead Michael, Tom
and Rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs
through the estate.

<b>LOW CLOSE VIEW
</b>
Michael's dispassionate face, looking down.  THE VIEW MOVES
to Hagen's, and then down to the murky water under the
bridge, where we see the bodies of three strangers, lying in
the moving water; machine-type guns nearby, with their
throats cut.  Light from the many flashlights illuminates
the grotesque scene.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>ttFish them out.

Several of the men wade down into the stream; Rocco helps,
and even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they
were.  They are total strangers; Rocco examines the type of
guns they used.

When they climb back onto the ground, Michael is gone.
Everyone notices it, but no one says anything.

Hagen stands there, holding the envelope Michael had given
him in his hand.

He realizes that now, he is the DON.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttGet rid of the bodies.  Tomorrow
ttmorning I want a report made to the
ttlocal police, and paper, that some
ttexplosives we keep on the property
ttwere accidentally ignited.

The men respond; Hagen makes the lonely walk back to the
lighted section of the compound, which now resembles a
prison camp.

<b>tttttttFADE OUT.
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT. STATE SENATE FLOOR - DAY
</b>
The Senate is in session; Senator Geary is on the floor
during a vote.  An aide approaches him, with a slip of paper.

<b>INT. GEARY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
The Senator steps behind his desk.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttAll right, Mr. Hagen, you've got
ttten minutes.

He flicks the switch of a small tape recorder.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>tt...and the tape will be running.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttActually, I've come with good news;
ttthe Corleone family has done you a
ttfavor.

The Senator immediately shuts the tape recorder off.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttWhat the hell are you talking about?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWe know you're a busy man, with
ttplenty of enemies -- we saw the
ttopportunity to do you a favor, and
ttwe did.  No strings.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttNo strings.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttYou know there's a Senate
ttInvestigating Committee recently
ttset up; we thought it would be
ttunfortunate if they were to trace
ttanything though-provoking to your
ttname.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttNo one can trace anything to me; I
ttpride myself on that.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttDo you gamble?

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttA little; what's so thought-
ttprovoking about that?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttDo you owe markers?

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttMaybe two, three thousand dollars.

Hagen leans forward, and deposits a handful of paper on the
Senator's desk.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThe Corleone family has paid them
ttoff for you...as an expression of
ttour esteem.

Geary quickly looks through the paid markers.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttThere's thirty grand worth of paid
ttoff markers -- I never owed that
ttmuch.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttOur mistake.  But what does it
ttmatter; it was our money.
ttt(rising)
ttWe don't even expect thanks.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttYou paid off thirty grand I never
ttowed.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWe'll keep it quiet; the people who
ttknow are trustworthy...the Committee
ttneedn't find out.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttAnd what's the price of their not
ttfinding out.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttSimple.  Be friendly like us.  Not
tthostile.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttt(he despises Hagen)
ttThanks...friend.

<b>EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - FULL VIEW - DAY
</b>
There are more men on duty than usual; not that there are
guns apparent, but it's clear that the boundaries are being
patrolled.

<b>VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE
</b>
Kay exits her house, followed by her children; she helps
them into her station wagon like any housewife, and drives
along the path leading to the main gate.

She's about to drive through, when one of the men steps in
front of her, raising his hand.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(graciously)
ttYes.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttI'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're
ttnot to let you through.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttt(disbelieving)
ttI'm going to the market.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttIf you could just give us a list,
ttwe'll pick up anything you want.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhose orders are these?

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttMr. Hagen's, ma'am.

We notice Hagen walking to them in the background.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttKay.

<b>VIEW THROUGH THE GATE
</b>
Hagen approaches the car; Kay gets out so they can talk away
from the children.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI wanted to explain this myself...
ttI had business in Carson City.

He walks with her a little way from the others; the children
run out of the station wagon, and start to play.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttIt's Michael's request...for your
ttsafety.  We can send out for
ttanything you need.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI'm supposed to stay in my house.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWithin the compound will be fine.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI was supposed to take the children
ttto New England next week.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThat's off now.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI'm going to see my parents.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttKay, Michael didn't tell me a lot;
ttand what he did tell me, I can't
ttrepeat.  But the responsibility for
ttyou and the kids was the most
ttimportant thing he left me with.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHow long does this go on?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI don't know.
ttt(pause)
ttI'm sorry, Kay...

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAm I a prisoner?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttThat's not the way we look at it.

Angrily, without another word, Kay turns away from him, and
walks to her children, ignoring the running station wagon.

<b>EXT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - DAY
</b>
The luxury liner making its way across the Atlantic.

<b>INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - MED. VIEW - DAY
</b>
The PURSER followed by several white uniformed associates
knocks on the door of something designated the &quot;Leonardo
Suite.&quot; He is holding a telegram.

The door opens, and a tanned Merle peeks out of the door.

<b>ttttPURSER
</b>ttt(holding up the telegram)
ttI'm terribly sorry to disturb you
ttbut we have received two telegrams.

<b>ttttMERLE
</b>ttt(reluctantly)
ttWell...come in.

This entourage enters the suite, an impressive and
beautifully spacious luxury suite.  Connie is relaxing.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttWhat is it?

<b>ttttPURSER
</b>ttYes.  One is from our office in New
ttYork.  The check that you wrote for
ttyour passage has been returned.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttCan't be...

<b>ttttMERLE
</b>ttWhy don't you wire your bank?

<b>ttttPURSER
</b>ttThe other telegram is from your

ttand the company is warned not to
ttextend any credit.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttI'll take care of it in Naples.

<b>ttttPURSER
</b>ttThe company hopes so.  But for now,
ttwe have orders to change your
ttaccommodations.

And with that, the men in white begin to pack Connie and
Merle's luggage.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttThat son of a bitch!

<b>INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - TINY THIRD CLASS CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
Connie and Merle are attempting to sleep in the miniature
cabin in bunk beds.  The little space is crowded with their
trunks and luggage.  Merle can barely hang onto the bunk,
the boat pitches so violently below.

<b>EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MED. VIEW - DAY
</b>
A train speeds across the countryside.

<b>INT. THE TRAIN - DAY
</b>
Inside the corridor, a porter advances, and knocks on the
door of a stateroom.  A voice tells him to enter.  OUR VIEW
enters with him as he carries a tray of lunch.  From this
POV we see Michael Corleone sitting in the compartment.

<b>ttttPORTER
</b>ttMr. Paul?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttPORTER
</b>ttYou ordered lunch?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttPut it right there.

The porter does so; as he places the tray down, he catches a
glimpse of a second person in the compartment with Michael.

<b>HIS VIEW
</b>
A very fierce, almost maniacal looking man, BUSSETTA.  He
nods that the porter should leave.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThank you.

The porter takes his advice and leaves quickly, closing the
door behind him.

<b>VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW
</b>
Michael and his mysterious companion have lunch together on
the moving train.

<b>EXT. GULFSTREAM RACE TRACK IN MIAMI - HIGH FULL VIEW - DAY
</b>
The empty parking lot of the Gulfstream track, on an off-
race day.

<b>CLOSER VIEW
</b>
Michael sits behind the wheel of a nondescript late model
car.  Bussetta sits in the rear.

Another car swings into the lot.  Michael starts his car,
and pulls out of the lot; the second car following.

<b>NEW VIEW
</b>
This car pulls out and begins to follow them.  Michael
glances back by adjusting the rear view mirror, and nods to
Bussetta.

Michael's car begins to slow down, allowing the other car to
overtake them.

The overtaking car hesitates a moment, moving side by side
with them.

Michael glances toward the driver.

<b>MICHAEL'S VIEW
</b>
We recognize Johnny Ola, who waves a greeting to Michael,
and then continues on to lead him.

<b>EXT. SUBURBAN MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</b>
Ola's car leads Michael's through a middle-class suburban
area of $30,000 to $40,000 homes.  There are small channels
with sporting and fishing boats parked near the houses.
Ola's car pulls up in front of a very simple, tract-type
home.  Michael's car parks nearby.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttt (to Bussetta)
ttYou'll wait in the car.

Ola has gotten out of his car and walks up the little path
to the front door.  Michael waits.

Ola rings the bell, and after a moment, a rather pretty,
middle-aged WOMAN answers, remaining behind the screen door.
Ola says a few things to her and she disappears, leaving the
door open.

Ola comes down the steps, looks at Michael, nodding to him.
Ola then gets into his car and drives off.  Michael walks up
the walkway and enters the little house, closing the door
behind him.

This woman, TERRI ROTH, is in the kitchen, looking out at
Michael.

<b>ttttTERRI
</b>ttI'm just going to make lunch.  How
ttabout a tuna fish sandwich?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThank you, Mrs. Roth.

She hurries halfway up the staircase.

<b>ttttTERRI
</b>ttHyman...HYMAN, your friend is here.
ttt(turning to Michael)
ttWhy don't you go right upstairs, Mr.
ttPaul?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttFine.

He continues upstairs; she goes into the kitchen.

<b>ttttTERRI
</b>ttI'll give a yell when lunch is ready.

Michael continues up to a small den on the second floor; we
can HEAR the sound of a baseball game coming over the
television.

<b>INT. HYMAN ROTH'S DEN - DAY
</b>
Michael enters the den: it's very comfortable, but somewhat
like a senior citizen's retirement home in Florida.

<b>MICHAEL'S VIEW
</b>
There, sitting before the television is a small man in his
middle sixties, thin, with a wizened face, looking like a
small-time retired Jewish businessman.  This is HYMAN ROTH.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttSit down, this is almost over.  You
ttfollow the baseball games?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNot for a few years.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttI like sporting events -- I really
ttenjoy watching them in the afternoon.
ttOne of the things I love about this
ttcountry.  I loved baseball ever
ttsince Arnold Rothstein fixed the
ttWorld Series of 1919...I heard you
tthad some trouble.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttWhat a mistake; people behaving
ttlike that, with guns.
ttt(he shakes his head)
ttIt was my understanding we left all
ttthat behind.  But, let me tell you,
ttthe important thing is that you're
ttall right.  Good health is the most
ttimportant thing; more than success;
ttmore than power; more than money.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThe incident of the other night is
tta nuisance that I can take care of.
ttI came to you because I want
ttnothing to affect our agreement; I
ttwanted to clear everything I'm
ttgoing to do with you, just in case.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttYou're a considerate young man.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYou're a great man, Mr. Roth, I
tthave much to learn from you.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttt(warmly)
ttHowever I can help you...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThe Rosato Brothers have performed
ttservices for you in the past; I
ttunderstand that they are under your
ttprotection.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttt(simply)
ttWe do favors for each other...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTechnically, they are still under
ttthe Clemenza wing of the Corleone
ttFamily, now run by Frankie
ttPentangeli.  After Clemenza died,
ttthe Rosatos wanted territory of
tttheir own.  Pentangeli refused, and
ttcame to me, asking for permission
ttto eliminate them.  I, of course,
ttknew of their relationship with
ttyou, and in gratitude for your help
ttwith the Tropicana matter, turned
tthim down.  Pentangeli was furious,
ttand paid one hundred and fifty
ttthousand dollars to have me killed.
ttI was lucky and he was stupid.
ttI'll visit him soon.
ttt(leaning toward the
tttold man, sincerely)
ttThe important thing is that nothing
ttjeopardize our plans, yours and
ttmine.  This thing of ours, that we
ttwill build.

The old man touches Michael's hand, warmly.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttNothing is more important.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttPentangeli is a dead man; do you
ttobject?

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttIt's always bad for business; but
ttyou have no choice.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThen it's done.  I must choose his
ttreplacement: it cannot be Rosato.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttOf course you must keep control of
ttyour family.

He turns to Michael, turning the volume higher on the
television, and moving closer to his young partner.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttMichael, these things are
ttunimportant.  Who should be the
ttmanager of a dime store, Joe or
ttJack?  Unimportant.  You do what
ttyou think is right.  You're a young
ttman, and I'm old and sick.  What we
ttdo together in the next few months
ttwill be history, Michael; it has
ttnever been done before.  We will do
ttthis historical thing together, and
tteven your Father could never dream
ttit would be possible.  We are
ttbigger than U.S. Steel, you and
ttme... because in America, anything
ttis possible!
ttt(pause)
ttBut soon I will be dead, and it
ttwill all belong to you.

There is a KNOCK on the door, and Terri Roth pushes the door
open with her hip.

<b>ttttTERRI
</b>ttMy goodness, you'll rupture your
tteardrums, Hyman.

She puts the tray down, and turns down the television.

The sinister Bussetta waits patiently in the rear seat of
the car, outside Roth's modest house.

<b>EXT. DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - MOVING VIEW - DAY
</b>
A black Cadillac moves down the street, slowed by the
Festivities of the Festa that is in progress: people milling
around, buying souvenirs at the many stands set up.

Sausage and grilled meats are prepared, just as they were
years ago.  Electric lights are strung from the street
lamps, and brightly colored banners pronounce the &quot;Festa of
the Madonna.&quot;

<b>MOVING CLOSE VIEW
</b>
Willy Cicci drives, frustrated that he cannot go any faster.
Next to him, Frankie Pentangeli sits, catching a few seconds'
snooze.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
The black car pulls up; another car that had been following
it parks nearby.

One of Pentangeli's button men gets out of the car, and
steps into a small Italian restaurant; he exits quickly, and
nods affirmatively toward Pentangeli's Cadillac.

The group of them step out quickly, men huddled around
Pentangeli, and enter the restaurant.

<b>INT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
The restaurant is quite empty, despite the excitement out on
the street.

Pentangeli immediately sits at a table with a tall, dark,
snappily dressed young man, CARMINE ROSATO.

Nearby, on the other side of the room is Rosato's brother,
TONY, seated with a group of their men.

At another table in the restaurant is a table of Pentangeli's
people: they are joined by bodyguards.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttRosato, where's your brother?

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttSitting right behind you.

Pentangeli glances behind himself.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttHe don't want to talk?

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttWe worked it all out beforehand.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttAre we going to eat or what?

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttSure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttt(sarcastically)
ttForget it; I'm suddenly without an

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttYou weren't straight with us,
ttFrankie, what else could we do?

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttWe could have talked first, saved a

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttYou wasn't listening, you didn't
ttwant to talk.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttDon't I look like I'm listening?

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttWe want Brooklyn one hundred

ttwant to be only loosely connected
ttwith your family -- sort of a

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttI'm a little hungry, maybe I'll

ttAnd in return for these concessions,

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttWe will release the hostages,

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttMy lawyer went over this beforehand.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttWhat assurances do I have that

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttThe same assurance we got from you.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttWhat if I say shove it?

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttThen Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue

</b>ttMaybe, yes... maybe no.

One of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian
food.

Pentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he
pushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's
hands.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttYou drove old Pete Clemenza to his
ttgrave, Carmine; you and your
ttbrother.  Turning on him; trouble
ttin his territories -- you and your
ttdemands.  I hold you responsible,
ttjust as though you shot him in the
tthead.  And I ain't gonna let that
ttgo for long!

Pentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little
tension between the bodyguards of the two factions.

<b>ttttROSATO (O.S.)
</b>ttHey, Five-Angels...

He gives him the arm.

Frankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here
and now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make
their move out.

<b>EXT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY
</b>
Pentangeli gets into the car.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttNobody I hate calls me Five-Angels
ttto my face!

He slams the door.

<b>EXT. PENTANGELI'S LONG BEACH ESTATE - DAY
</b>
Part of the old estate of Don Corleone.  By now, the wall
has been torn down, and the other houses sold off.

His car is parked; Pentangeli steps out, still angry over
the confrontation.  As he approaches the house, he notices
something strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard
his house.  No one seems to want to tell him.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttWhat's up?

Pentangeli glances over to the front door foyer.

<b>PENTANGELI'S VIEW
</b>
The strange and silent Bussetta, the man who now always
travels with Michael.

<b>INT. PENTANGELI'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Pentangeli enters; he sees his WIFE, standing oddly in the
hallway.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttWhat's this?

<b>ttttWIFE
</b>ttMichael Corleone.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttOne Michael Corleone...Dove?

<b>ttttWIFE
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttHe's in your study.

He knows it is very very serious for Michael to be here in
his home.

He automatically moves into his study.

<b>INT. PENTANGELI'S STUDY - DAY
</b>
Michael stands quietly in the room.  This was once his
father's study, although it is totally redecorated.
Pentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don,
and kisses his hand.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttDon Corleone, I wish you let me
ttknow you was coming.  We could have
ttprepared something for you.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI didn't want you to know I was
ttcoming.  You heard what happened in
ttmy home?

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttMichael, yes, we was all relieved...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(furious)
ttIn my home!  In the same room where
ttmy wife was sleeping; where my
ttchildren come in their pajamas, and
ttplay with their toys.

He's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as
suddenly, he talks quietly, calmly.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI want you to help me take my
ttrevenge.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttMichael, anything.  What is it I
ttcan do for you?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI want you to settle these troubles
ttwith the Rosato Brothers.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttI was just going to contact you,
ttMichael; we just had a 'sit-down' -
ttin fact, I just come from there.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI want you to settle on their terms.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttMike, I don't understand.  Don't
ttask me to do that.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTrust me; do as I ask.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttIt would be the beginning of the
ttend for my family.  How can I keep
ttall my other territories in like if
ttI let two wise-guys stand up and
ttdemand this and that, and then give
ttit to them?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttFrankie...do you respect me?  Do I
tthave your loyalty?

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttAlways... But sometimes I don't
ttunderstand.  I know I'll never have
ttyour kind of brains, in big deals.
ttBut Mike, this is a street thing.
ttAnd Hyman Roth in Miami is behind
ttthe Rosato Brothers.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI know.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttThen why do you want me to lay down
ttto them?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(coldly, but convincing)
ttFrankie, Roth tried to have me
ttkilled.  I'm sure it was him, but I
ttdon't know yet why.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttJesus Christ, Michael, then let's
tthit 'em now, while we still got the
ttmuscle.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThis was my father's old study.
ttWhen I was a kid, we had to be
ttquiet when we played near here.
ttWhen I was older, I learned many
ttthings from him here.  I was happy
ttthat this house never went to
ttstrangers; first Clemenza took it
ttover, and then you.  My father
tttaught me, in this room, never to
ttact until you know everything
ttthat's behind things.  Never.  If
ttHyman Roth sees that I interceded
ttwith you in the Rosato Brothers'
ttfavor, he'll think his relationship
ttwith me is still sound.  I'm going
ttsomewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We
tthave friends in some very important
ttbusiness that we're making.  Do
ttthis for me; you make the peace
ttwith the Rosato Brothers on their
ttterms.  Let the word out that I
ttforced you; you're not happy wit
tthit, but acquiesced, just because
ttof me.  It will get back to Hyman
ttRoth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can
tttrust me.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttSure, Mike.  I'll go along.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttGood.

They embrace; Michael kisses him.  He looks at the young
Don, thoughtfully.

<b>INT. TROPICANA HOTEL - CLOSE VIEW - DAY
</b>
The money trays are carefully unloaded from the gaming
tables, and put on a cart with others.

The cart, preceded and followed by security guards, is then
wheeled through the casino, into a private, counting room.

<b>INT. COUNTING ROOM - MED. VIEW - DAY
</b>
The guards leave the room; the door is locked after them,
leaving only Hagen.  Neri and an ACCOUNTANT, a very fat man.
The numbered boxes are opened, and cash and checks are
spread out on the counting table.

The accountant begins with amazing speed and skill, to count
and divide the money.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttFifteen percent skim?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttTwenty-five this time.

The accountant stops, and looks up to Neri.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttIt might show.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttMike wants it.

Neri nods, and the accountant continues.  Neri opens a door,
allowing a sandy-haired man, a COURIER, into the room.  The
cream is placed into his pouch personally by Neri.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttWe've never sent this much with one
ttcourier.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt(to the courier)
ttYour plans are a little different
ttthis time.  You skip Miami, and go
ttstraight to Geneva.  It's to be
ttdeposited to this number.
ttt(handing him a small envelope)
ttAnd it's got to be there by Monday
ttmorning, no slip-up.

<b>ttttCOURIER
</b>ttI think I was 'picked-up' last trip.
ttThat hour layover I had at Kennedy.
ttI went over and bought a paper...

Neri has finished putting the 'creamed' money into the pouch.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttThose were our people.

<b>ttttCOURIER
</b>ttOkay, just thought you should know.

He is just about to close and lock the pouch, when Hagen
gestures that he should wait, and adds more stacks of
carefully packaged bills into the pouch.  Then Neri locks
it, and handcuffs it to the courier's arm, looking
inquiringly at Hagen.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttLet them count.

The courier is shown out through a private door, and then
the first door is opened.  Two accountants come in with the
guards, and the trays are opened, and the counting process
is begun all over again, this time with the State Tally
sheets.

<b>INT. TROPICANA CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW - DAY
</b>
The courier continues on his way; followed by Hagen and Neri.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttWhat's up?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttNo questions.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttI got to ask questions, Tom,
ttthere's three million dollars cash
ttin that pouch; Mike is gone and I
tthave no word from him.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttAl, as far as you're concerned, I'm
ttthe Don.

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttHow do I know you haven't gone into
ttbusiness for yourself?

This hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he
owes Neri some explanation.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttYou've been through a lot with us
ttso I'm going to give you the truth.
ttMike knows it was someone within
ttthe compound that set him up for
ttthat hit.  So nobody is to know
ttwhere he is, not you, not Rocco,
ttnot even his brother Fredo.  Sorry,
ttAl, I know how you feel about
ttMike...but he still remembers Tessio.

<b>EXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT
</b>
Michael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock.  He is
followed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped
onto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser.  The crew cast
off various ropes, and the boat sets out into the night.

<b>tttttttFADE OUT.
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY
</b>
A seaplane lands nicely by the private Corleone harbor;
Hagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase.
He continues down the ramp, past several Buttonmen, dressed
in summer casual attire, and who resemble secret service men
rather than thugs.

His wife THERESA lies on a blanket on the great lawn, with
her youngest children, who run to their father for a kiss.

<b>ttttTHERESA
</b>ttHungry?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttJust a little.

<b>ttttTHERESA
</b>ttI've invited Mama, Sandra and the
ttkids for barbecue.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWhat about Kay?

<b>ttttTHERESA
</b>ttI couldn't find her.  She's been so
ttbroody, sticks to herself.

<b>EXT. TAHOE LAWN BARBECUE - MED. VIEW - DAY
</b>
Hagen and Sonny's boys are throwing a football around on the
lawn; the littler kids running after them.

Coals are burning in the old style stone barbecue, and
several tables are set for the family.

In the distance, there is always evidence of the bodyguards.

Theresa, Mama and Sandra prepare the steaks.

Hagen relaxes in a sports shirt.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttLet me try Kay.

He crosses the lawn, to the house on the beach where Michael
and his family live.  Is about to knock on the door:

<b>ttttHAGEN'S SON
</b>ttHey, Pop, heads up!

The football is flying in his direction; he catches it and
throws it back.  Then he cracks the door open, and peeks in.

<b>INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttKay?

He steps in, the beautiful summer living room is neat, but
empty.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttAnyone hungry?

He moves through the house more quickly; into the dining and
recreation room areas.  A cat jumps off a pile of cushions
and runs across the room.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttHello?

<b>ttttSANDRA (O.S.)
</b>ttShe's gone, Tom.

Sandra has followed him into Michael's house.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWhat do you mean gone?

<b>ttttSANDRA
</b>ttThe Barretts from Rubicon Bay came
ttby in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried
ttto say she wasn't in, but Kay
ttspotted them and asked if they
ttwould take her and the kids for a
ttride.  That was three hours ago.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt(furious)
ttWhy didn't someone tell me!

<b>ttttSANDRA
</b>ttI wanted to tell you alone; your
ttwife doesn't know what's going on.

Hagen rushes out of the house.

<b>EXT. TAHOE LAWN - DAY
</b>
Hagen moves quickly out of Michael's house; moving across
the lawn to the boathouse.

<b>ttttHAGEN'S SON
</b>ttHey, Dad!

This time he ignores the thrown ball, and moves directly to
Rocco, who is by some men near the boathouse.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttRocco!

<b>ttttROCCO
</b>ttI know.  I went down to the Barrett
tthouse.  But she's gone.  They drove
tther and the kids to North Tahoe
ttairport.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttGoddamn it, where were you?

<b>ttttROCCO
</b>ttI was in my house.  Willy tried,
ttbut it would have taken some
ttstrong-arm to stop her, and he
ttfigured you wouldn't want that.

<b>INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY
</b>
They enter the boathouse.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt(to one of the men)
ttGet me a Scotch and water.

The man hurries behind the bar.

<b>ttttROCCO
</b>ttShe took a flight to San Francisco.
ttWe figure she's going to connect to
ttNew Hampshire; her parents' place.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt(almost to himself)
ttI can't let him down.

He swallows the drink down in several gulps.  And then looks
up to his men watching him.  He's embarrassed to have shown
such weakness.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttAll right, let me think a minute.

Rocco clears the men out.

<b>ttttROCCO
</b>ttMe too, Tom?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttYeah, give me a minute.

Rocco gone, Hagen moves behind the enormous bar, and pours
himself a giant drink.  He drinks that, and calms himself.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttOh Christ, Pop.  It was so good
ttwhen you were alive.  I felt I
ttcould handle anything...

<b>EXT. VIEW FROM BOAT - FULL VIEW - DAY
</b>
A beautiful coastal view of a tropical Caribbean city.  An
extraordinary view, high buildings, palm trees, all set
right on the bay.

<b>MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
on the cruiser, Bussetta a little distance away, watching,
but never speaking.  The dark-skinned CAPTAIN of the cruiser
keeps pointing repeatedly.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttHabana, Habana.

<b>EXT. HAVANA STREET - MOVING VIEW - DAY
</b>
Michael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making
its way through the streets of Havana.

<b>CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
looking out the window.

<b>MICHAEL'S POV
</b>
Crowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the
tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans
walking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we
see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat,
carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all
of these street impressions, the city is booming with
activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and
pimps and little children begging in the streets.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
The big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is
sitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in
the back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees
four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their
hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry.
The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away
in Spanish.

<b>INT. HAVANA CASINO LOBBY - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
Michael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the
hotel, done in Spanish style, apparently just recently
completed.  He is approached by a thin, mousy man, SAM ROTH,
who ushers him toward the casino entrance.

<b>ttttSAM ROTH
</b>ttHiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth.
ttWelcome to the Capri; my brother's
ttupstairs.  You wanta take a rest
ttbefore you see him, or can I get
ttyou something, anything at all?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo, I'm fine.

He leads Michael into the main casino.

<b>ttttSAM ROTH
</b>ttThis is it!  We think it makes
ttVegas look like the corner crap game.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttVery impressive.

<b>ttttSAM ROTH
</b>ttJake, Jake, come over here.  Mike,
ttI want you to meet Jake Cohen; he
ttmanages the casino for us.

<b>ttttCOHEN
</b>ttt(appreciating
tttMichael's status)
ttMr. Corleone.

Sam turns to Bussetta and extends his glad-hand.

<b>ttttSAM ROTH
</b>ttPleasure to meet you, I'm sure...

He gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta.

<b>INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT
</b>
An extremely tall, well-built Cuban, tanned and wearing an
attractive mustache, LEON, in his middle forties, reads from
a prepared paper.  His sentences are translated by a smaller
man, standing to his rear.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttt(Spanish)
ttMost respected gentlemen, allow me
ttto welcome you to the City of
ttHavana, the Republic of Cuba on
ttbehalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio
ttBatista.

THE VIEW BEGINS TO MOVE along the various men gathered for
this meeting.

<b>ttttLEON (O.S.)
</b>ttI'd like to thank this distinguished

ttfor continuing to work with Cuba,
ttfor the greatest period of

ttthe General Fruit Company... Messrs.
ttCorngold and Dant, of the United

ttthe Pan American Mining Corporation;
ttand, of course, our friend Mr.
ttRobert Allen, of South American
ttSugar.  Mr. Nash of the American
ttState Department.  And Mr. Hyman
ttRoth of Miami, and Michael Corleone
ttof Nevada representing our
ttAssociates in Tourism and Leisure
ttActivities.

<b>VIEW ON THE ENTIRE GROUP
</b>
Leon pauses to take a drink of water.  Then proudly, he
lifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttThe President would like to take
ttthis opportunity to thank U T&amp;T for
tttheir lovely gift: a solid gold
tttelephone!  He thought all you
ttgentlemen would care to take a look
ttat it.

He hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides, and it is
passed in turn to each of the men in attendance.

<b>ttttCORNGOLD
</b>ttYour Excellency, perhaps you could
ttdiscuss the status of rebel activity
ttand how this may affect our
ttbusinesses.

<b>MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
He receives the telephone, and glances at it before passing
it on to Hyman Roth.

<b>ttttLEON (O.S.)
</b>ttOf course.  The rebel movement is
ttbasically unpopular, and since July
ttof 1958 has been contained in the
ttOriente Province, in the mountains
ttof the Sierra Muestre.

Michael passes the phone on to Roth.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWe began a highly successful
ttoffensive against them in March,
ttand activities within the city
ttitself are at a minimum.  I can
ttassure you we'll tolerate no
ttguerrillas in the casinos or
ttswimming pools!

General subdued laughter.

<b>A CUBAN STREET - LATE DAY
</b>
Police are stopping traffic.  Michael's Mercury is among the
cars; a police officer, seeing that some important person is
being driven, walks up to the driver.  He leans forward, and
says something in Spanish to the driver.

The driver, in turn, leans over to Michael.

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttHe says it will just be a short
tttime and they'll let us through.

Michael looks out the window.

<b>MICHAEL'S VIEW
</b>
The old building has been totally surrounded by police and
military vehicles.  Right at this moment, they are waiting
lazily, but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready.
There is a momentary commotion inside the building, and the
men brace up.  A Captain of the Army detachment says
something in Spanish over a megaphone; and his men put their
weapons at the ready, as other policemen lead a group of
civilians out of the building with their hands up.

They are moved over to some military truck, where they are
frisked before being loaded.

All of a sudden, one of the civilian rebels breaks loose,
and rushes toward the command vehicle.  He hurls himself
into the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out.  A
second later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously
having hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own
life to take the life of the Captain.

There is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it.

<b>CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
watching.  The police rush to Michael's car and guide it
outside of the trouble area.

<b>EXT. HAVANA COUNTRY CLUB - CLOSE VIEW - DAY
</b>
Some glasses; rum is poured into them; then Coca Cola.
Quarter limes are squeezed.

<b>ttttSAM ROTH (O.S.)
</b>ttRum... Coca Cola...a squeeze of
ttfresh lime...

Sam prepares the drinks for his brother, Hyman, and a group
of men, including Michael.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttCuba Libres.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI was told the Cubans now call this
ttdrink: &quot;La Mentira.&quot;

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttI still don't speak Spanish, Michael.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;

A moment's hesitation, then a few of the men laugh.  Now two
Cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake
on it.

<b>ttttSAM ROTH
</b>ttThe cake is here.

They all raise their glasses to the old man.

<b>ttttEVERYONE
</b>ttt(ad lib)
ttHappy Birthday!

Roth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttI hope my age is correct: I am
ttalways accurate about my age.

Some laugh.  He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece
on plates, and carry them to the different men.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttEverything we've learned in Vegas
ttis true here; but we can go further.
ttThe bigger, the swankier, the
ttplusher the store, the more a sense
ttof legitimacy, and the bigger
ttbusiness we do.
ttt(looking at the plate
tttbrought to him)
ttA smaller piece.  What we've
ttproposed to the Cuban Government is
ttthat it put up half the cash on a
ttdollar for dollar basis.
ttt(accepting a smaller piece)
ttThank you.  We can find people in
ttthe United States who will put up
ttour share for a small piece of the
ttaction, yet we will retain control.

<b>ttttONE OF THE MEN
</b>ttHow much?

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttA hundred million dollars.  But
ttonly if this Government relaxes its
ttrestrictions on importing building
ttmaterials; we'll need some new
ttlaws, too, but that will be no
ttdifficulty.

<b>ttttANOTHER MAN
</b>ttWhat are import duties now?

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttAs much as seventy percent.  Also,
ttI'm working out an arrangement with
ttthe Minister of Labor so that all
ttour pit bosses, stick-men and
ttDealers, can be considered
ttspecialized technicians eligible
ttfor two year visas.  As of now
ttthey're only allowed in Cuba for
ttsix months at a time.  In short,
ttwe're in a full partnership with
ttthe Cuban Government.

</b>
is handed a piece of cake.  Roth moves over to a folder of
documents.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHere are applications from Friends
ttall over the States.  I understand
ttSanto Virgilio in Tampa is trying
ttto make his own deal.  Well, the
ttCuban Government will brush him off.
ttThe Lakeville Road Boys are going
ttto take over the Nacionale here.
ttI'm planning a new hotel casino to
ttbe known as Riviera.  The new Capri
ttwill go to the Corleone Family.

</b>
The cake is sliced and carried to each of the men.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttThen there's the Sevilla Biltmore;
ttthe Havana Hilton, which is going
ttto cost twenty-four million --
ttCuban banks will put up half, the
ttTeamsters will bankroll the rest.
ttGenerally, there will be friends
ttfor all our friends including the
ttLieutenant Governor of Nevada;
ttEddie Levine of Newport will bring
ttin the Pennino Brothers, Dino and
ttEddie; they'll handle actual casino
ttoperations.

And seeing that all of his friends have been served, Roth
raises his fork.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttEnjoy.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI saw an interesting thing today.
ttA man was being arrested by the
ttMilitary Police; probably an urban
ttguerrilla.  Rather than be taken
ttalive, he exploded a grenade hidden
ttin his jacket, taking the command
ttvehicle with him.

The various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wondering
what the point of it is.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt occurred to me: the police are
ttpaid to fight, and the Rebels are
ttnot.

<b>ttttSAM ROTH
</b>ttSo?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttSo, that occurred to me.

<b>VIEW ON ROTH
</b>
He understands Michael's point, if the others do not.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttThis country has had rebels for the
ttlast fifty years; it's part of
tttheir blood.  Believe me, I know...
ttI've been coming here since the
tttwenties; we were running molasses
ttout of Havana when you were a baby.
ttTo trucks owned by your father.
ttt(he chuckles warmly
tttover the memory)
ttWe'll talk when we're alone.

And he returns his attention to the men who are gathered
with him on his birthday.

Michael sits alone with the old man, on a terrace that
overlooks the city.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttYou have to be careful what you say
ttin front of the others... they
ttfrighten easy.  It's always been
ttthat way, most men frighten easy.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWe're making a big investment in
ttCuba.  That's my only concern.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttMy concern is that the three
ttmillion never arrived at Batista's
ttnumbered account in Switzerland.
ttHe thinks it's because you have
ttsecond thoughts about his ability
ttto stop the rebels.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThe money was sent.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttThen you have to trace it.  Michael,
ttpeople here look at me as a reliable
ttman.  I can't afford not to be
ttlooked on as a reliable man.  But
ttyou know all that; there's nothing
ttyou can learn from me.  You
ttshouldn't have to put up with a
ttsick old man as a partner.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI wouldn't consider anyone else.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttExcept the President of the United
ttStates.

He laughs slyly, as though this is some private joke between
them.  Then his laughter becomes a cough, which he painfully
stifles with a handkerchief.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttIf only I could live to see it,
ttkid; to be there with you.  How
ttbeautifully we've done it, step by
ttstep.  Here, protected, free to
ttmake our profits without the
ttJustice Department, the FBI; ninety
ttmiles away in partnership with a
ttfriendly government.  Ninety miles,
ttjust a small step, looking for a
ttman who desperately wants to be
ttPresident of the United States, and
tthaving the cash to make it possible.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttYou'll be there to see it; you'll
ttbe there.

<b>INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - NIGHT

Michael is openly disturbed that Hagen is not there.  He
hangs up without answering.

<b>EXT. NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Tom Hagen steps out of a taxicab a bit tentatively, and then
steps toward the door of a pleasant New England house.  He
rings the bell and waits, hat in hand.  A moment later, the
door opens, and Kay is standing there.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI'm not surprised to see you, Tom.

playing by himself.

<b>ttttKAY (O.S.)
</b>ttI can't love a man like that; I

tthim be father to my children.  Look.

The little boy, moodily by himself.

</b>
obviously moved.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHe's not like a little boy... he
ttdoesn't talk to me; he doesn't want
ttto play; he doesn't like other
ttchildren, he doesn't like toys.
ttIt's as though he's waiting for the
tttime he can take his Father's place.
ttt(almost in tears)
ttYou know what he told me when he
ttwas four years old.  He said he had
ttkilled his Grandfather...

<b>VIEW ON HAGEN
</b>
listening, calmly.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>tt... He said he had shot his
ttGrandfather with a gun, and then he
ttdied in the garden.  And he asked
ttme... he asked me, Tom, if that
ttmeant now his father would shoot
tthim out of... revenge.

ttHow does a four year old boy learn
ttthe word... 'revenge'?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttKay... Kay...

<b>VIEW ON KAY
</b>
<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhat kind of a family is this...
ttare we human beings?  He knows his
ttFather killed his Uncle Carlo.  He
ttheard Connie.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttYou don't know that's true.  But
ttKay, just for the sake of an
ttargument, let's assume it is, I'm
ttnot saying it is, remember, but...
ttWhat if I gave you what might be
ttsome justification for what he
ttdid... or rather some possible
ttjustification for what he possibly
ttdid.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttThat's the first time I've seen the
ttlawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not
ttyour best side.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttOkay, just hear me out.  What if
ttCarlo had been paid to help get
ttSonny killed?  What if his beating
ttof Connie that time was a deliberate
ttplot to get Sonny out into the open?
ttThen what?  And what if the Don, a
ttgreat man, couldn't bring himself
ttto do what he had to do, avenge his
ttson's death by killing his
ttdaughter's husband?  What if that,
ttfinally, was too much for him, and
tthe made Michael his successor,
ttknowing that Michael would take
ttthat load off his shoulders, would
tttake that guilt?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttHe's not the same as when I met him.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttIf he were, he'd be dead by now.
ttYou'd be a widow.  You'd have no
ttproblem.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhat the hell does that mean?  Come
tton, Tom, speak out straight once in
ttyour life.  I know Michael can't,
ttbut you're not Sicilian, you can
tttell a woman the truth; you can
tttreat her like an equal, a fellow
tthuman being.

There is a long silence.

Then Hagen shakes his head; he can tell her no more.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttIf you told Michael what I've told
ttyou today, I'm a dead man.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttWhen is it finally over?  I want it
ttto be over before my baby is born.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttI don't know.  I hope soon; but
ttit's not over yet, and that's why
ttyou and the kids have to come back
ttto me.

He looks at her; it's clear that he has been entrusted with
her safety and her children's.

He is a kind, good man, and seems very nervous and
overwrought.

<b>VIEW ON THE WINDOW

Little Anthony is pressing his face against the glass pane,

importance to him.

<b>EXT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY
</b>
There is a light rain.  Pentangeli steps out of his car;
points to Willy Cicci.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttWait in the car.

He walks up the street, to the bar, where he is greeted by
the tall, handsome Carmine Rosato.  They shake hands.
Pentangeli looks in his hand.

<b>CLOSE VIEW
</b>
Rosato has put a crisp one hundred dollar bill in his hand,
folded sharply in two.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttWhat's this?

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttThat's a lucky C note for our new
ttdeal.

He puts his arm around Pentangeli, and they walk into the bar.

<b>INT. THE BAR - DAY
</b>
The bar is fairly empty; and very dark.  Pentangeli and
Rosato step up to the bar; the bartender momentarily stops
polishing glasses to pour a couple of drinks.

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttWe were all real happy about your
ttdecision, Frankie; you're not goin'
ttto regret it.

He holds up the glass.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttI don't like the C-note.  I take it
ttlike an insult.

Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around Pentangeli's throat;
and he is forcefully yanked back into the shadows, all the
way into a wooden telephone booth.

<b>CLOSE VIEW
</b>
The folded hundred dollar bill resting on the bar.

<b>MED. CLOSE - THE PHONE BOOTH
</b>
We see only Pentangeli's feet and legs, struggling.  We HEAR
the terrible sounds of a man being strangled.

<b>CLOSE ON ROSATO

Calm, and then he sees something that disturbs him.

<b>ttttROSATO
</b>ttShit, your friend the cop!

Suddenly, the side door opens, and a shaft of sunlight cuts
through the darkness.

Pentangeli's feet stop moving.

ttStutz!  Watch out, Stutz!

<b>EXT. THE BAR - DAY
</b>
We see that a patrol car had stopped for its routine visit.
STUTZ, the second patrolman, is just stepping out of his
car; Pentangeli's bodyguard, seeing the commotion, leaps out.
Three men, including Rosato, rush out.  There is gunfire;
Cicci is wounded.

<b>INT. ROTH'S SUITE IN HAVANA - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON ROTH - DAY
</b>
His wizened face, pale.  Right now, though, his eyes have a
sparkle as he watches three million dollars in cold cash
being counted on a card table in front of him.

His brother Sam is present, and the sandy-haired Courier, a
little nervous; the one who had left from the Tropicana with
the Corleone skim-money.  Also Johnny Ola.  The money is
evidently all there; Roth picks up a packet; probably a
hundred thousand dollars, and throws it over to the Courier.

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttMake it fast; I don't want to

ttWhat about the arrangements?  How
ttcan I be sure about the arrangements?

<b>ttttOLA
</b>ttRelax.  You're under our protection;
ttthe Corleone family will never find
ttyou.

Ola leads the Courier to the adjoining room where two
smartly dressed Military (Cuban) Police are standing, and a
civilian.  The Courier sees them, looks back to Ola.  One of
the police steps forward, placing the Courier under arrest;
handcuffing him.

<b>ttttCOURIER
</b>ttHey, what's this?

The other takes the packet of money, and hands it to the
civilian, who places it in the briefcase he carries.  The
other officer kneels down and fastens leg manacles.

<b>ttttCOURIER
</b>ttThe arrangements... YOU BASTARDS!
ttWhat...

The Captain strikes him expertly across the side of his head
with his pistol.

Ola closes the door on this scene.

<b>EXT. THE HAVANA CAPRI - DAY
</b>
Fredo Corleone steps out of a car, squints up at the sunshine
and palm trees.  He is holding on tightly to a small satchel,
which he won't let the bellman carry along with his other
things.

<b>INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Michael and Fredo in a brother's embrace; they kiss each
other.  Fredo is still in his jacket, holding the satchel.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttMikey.  How are you?

He glances up at Bussetta, who doesn't say a word.  Fredo
extends his hand.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttHiya, Freddie Corleone.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttMio fratello.

Then Bussetta offers his hand back to Fredo.

</b>ttt(taking off his jacket)
ttWhat a trip, Jesus Christ, the
ttwhole time I'm thinking what if

cash.  Then he stops, remembering that there's a stranger in
the room.

and over again.

<b>ttttROTH

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI know it wasn't me...so that

<b>ttttROTH
</b>ttThere was this kid that I grew up
ttwith; he was a couple years younger

<b>EXT. GARISH HAVANA STREET - NIGHT
</b>
The street is lit with tons of neon signs; it is alive with
people; some roving bands of musicians.  Everywhere are
little boys running around, begging for money.  And in
doorways and windows are silent, dark-skinned women.

<b>INT. 'SUPERMAN SHOW' - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
A large room with a succession of platforms arranged step-
like around a circular area which becomes a stage.

There are a hundred or so people, practically all men,
tourists and business men, standing on the different levels,
forming the audience.

In the center of the stage is a thick, telephone type pole,
to which is tied a young Cuban girl, in a flimsy white
sacrificial slip.  A small band, mostly drummers, play some
Latin music.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
Fredo's party standing on the ramp, looking down at the
spectacle.  They're a little woozy from the drinks and late
hour.  Michael is with them, but now we sense he is using
this time, with all exhausted and drunk, to come to some
important conclusions.

<b>ttttQUESTADT
</b>ttWhy do we have to stand?

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttEveryone stands.  But it's worth
ttit, watch!

<b>VIEW ON THE ARENA
</b>
Now two high priestesses, scantily clad, bring in a tall and
muscular Cuban, done up in chains and loin cloth, as though
he were a captured slave.  This is SUPERMAN

</b>
<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttThat's him; that's Superman!

Some preliminary pornographic proceedings go on, as the

CLOSE on Michael turning away.  Not because of the spectacle
which he finds disgusting, but at what his brother is saying.

<b>ttttFREDO (O.S.)
</b>tt... but seeing is believing.  Ole

<b>tttttttFADE OUT.
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - MORNING
</b>
Michael is alone in his bedroom; it seems as though he
hasn't slept very much, but sits by his window, looking out
at the city.  He is troubled and tired.

His radio is on:

<b>ttttRADIO
</b>ttt(Spanish)
tt&quot;This is Rebel Radio: Rebel troops
ttof Column Four 'Jose Marti' took
ttthe town of Baire yesterday at 8:30
ttp.m.  The enemy has retreated...&quot;

<b>EXT. CUBAN STREET - MORNING
</b>
This street in Havana is like a Caribbean tourist city with
no indication of the revolution in progress.

Michael walks along the street, alone, past the Cubans on
their way to work; past the American ladies who have gotten
up early for their shopping spree.

<b>ttttRADIO
</b>ttt(Spanish)
ttt (continuing)
tt... An important military action is
ttdeveloping along a 35-kilometer
ttstretch of the Central Highway.
ttNumerous enemy garrisons are left
ttwith two alternatives, surrender or

One full block away, Bussetta rides in the front seat of the
dark Mercury, driving slowly, giving Michael his privacy,
but never letting him out of Bussetta's sight.

tt... Victories in war depend on a
ttminimum on weapons and to a maximum
tton morale...

<b>VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
glances back to the dark car following him.  In a moment, it
pulls up to him, and he gets into the back seat.

<b>EXT. AMERICAN MILITARY MISSION - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY
</b>
standing by his car, looking through the cyclone fencing
that borders this military training camp operated by the
American Army near the city.

<b>ttttRADIO
</b>tt... War is not a simple question of
ttrifles, bullets, guns and planes...

<b>CLOSER VIEW INTO THE CAMP
</b>
<b>EXT. HAVANA STREET - DAY
</b>
A street singer, followed by a guitarist sings Jose Marti's
words of &quot;Guantanamera.&quot; It is solemn, as though it is a
song of protest, a song of the revolution.

Nearby, in a restaurant, Michael has lunch with Fredo.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHow is your wife, Fredo...your
ttmarriage?

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttt(eating)
ttYou know her; drives me crazy, one
ttminute she's a popsicle, the next
ttshe's all vinegar.  Sometimes I
ttthink... I think - I should a
ttmarried someone, like you did.  To
tthave kids, to have a family.

Michael turns, distracted for a moment at something the
singer has sung.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot;
ttI am a sincere man,
ttFrom the land of the palms...

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThe song.  Are you sincere with me,
ttFredo?

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttSincere.  What are you talking

</b>ttThen I'm going to confide in you;

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttMike, are you crazy, I'm your

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTonight we've been invited to a
ttreception at the Presidential
ttPalace; to bring in the New Year.
ttYou and I will go in a special car
ttthat's being sent.  They'll have
ttcocktails... then dinner, and a
ttreception with the President.  When
ttit's over, it will be suggested
ttthat you take Questadt and his
ttfriends from Washington to spend
ttthe night with some women.  I'll go

ttassassinated.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>tt...Who?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThe same man who tried in Nevada...
ttHyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttBut, you told me yourself...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt was never Pentangeli... I've
ttalways known that.  It was Roth all
ttalong.  He talks to me as a son; as
tthis successor, but the old man
ttthinks he'll live forever.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttWhat do you want me to do?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttTo go tonight, with me, as though
ttwe know nothing.  I've already made
ttmy move.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttWhat is it?  Can I help?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThe old man will never bring in the
ttNew Year.

Fredo realizes what he means; looks immediately to Bussetta,
who had been sitting near the door and the musicians.  He is
gone.

<b>INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW ON BUSSETTA - NIGHT
</b>
The first time ever away from Michael, moving toward us
quickly.  He stops, knocks on the door of Roth's suite.
Then quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to
the adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears
inside.

A moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused
Johnny Ola, opens the first door.  He steps out into the
corridor, to see who had knocked.  Confused, he is about to
return inside, when Bussetta easily breaks his neck in two
from behind.

<b>INT. THE SUITE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
as Bussetta quietly pulls the limp body of Johnny Ola, his
head bent at an impossible angle, and lays it at the foot of
the couch.

<b>EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT
</b>
Guards who are regular troops patrol the Palace in twos,
carrying machine weapons.

Now an elite officer, checks the identification of the
various cars carrying dignitaries, as they are driven up to
the Palace.  The one being inspected at the moment contains
Fredo and Michael.  We can see the beautifully dressed
people on their way to the reception, and sense the cheerful
mood of this New Year's Eve.

<b>INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
Bussetta bends over Ola's body, tying the wrists and knees
with electrical extensions.  He then easily carries the body
to the small balcony which all the rooms have.

<b>EXT. THE BALCONY - NIGHT
</b>
Bussetta swings the body over the side of the balcony
railing; tying the extension cord to the railing, and
suspending the body so that it is invisible both from the
inside and out during the night.

<b>INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - VIEW ON THE MAIN FOYER - NIGHT
</b>
The PRESIDENT, his WIFE and six oldest CHILDREN great
formally the many beautifully and affluently dressed guests.
He speaks to them in Spanish, as one by one they file to him.

Michael and Fredo are presented in a group with several
other Americans, including several of the American
businessmen with interests in Cuba.

<b>EXT. STREETS OF HAVANA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
The excitement of the night is beginning to build; people
are out in the streets; poor people, but they are
enthusiastic and lively.

<b>NEW VIEW
</b>
Traffic stops, as an ambulance speeds its way to a hospital;
SIREN going.

<b>INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
Bussetta delicately picks up a small satin cushion that had
fallen from the couch, and replaces it as though nothing had
happened.  Slowly he cracks the door open which adjoins
Roth's bedroom.  There is a slight commotion; whispered
voices.

<b>BUSSETTA'S VIEW
</b>
Terri, Mrs. Roth, is crying.  A group of men lift Hyman
Roth's frail body onto a stretcher.

<b>CLOSE ON BUSSETTA
</b>
realizes that this is the man he is to kill.

<b>CLOSER VIEW ON ROTH
</b>
He is alive; breathing hard with his mouth dry and open.
The doctor examines him, and then gives instructions to the
orderly who carries him out, presumably to the ambulance.

Bussetta closes the door on this VIEW.

<b>INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT
</b>
An orchestra plays for the guests, as an army of waiters
serve champagne and hors d'oeuvres.  Michael relaxes with
Senator Geary, Major Leon, and several of the Americans.

<b>ttttQUESTADT
</b>ttThe embargo on arms shipments from
ttthe U.S. to your government, was
ttjust a necessary public relations
ttmove... Only last month, your air
ttforce received a major shipment of
ttrockets...

Michael glances at his watch; Fredo concentrates on this.

<b>ttttSENATOR GEARY
</b>ttWe believe in non-intervention...
ttbut the agreement stipulates that
ttour forces may be withdrawn... but
ttas you've seen, we have not
ttwithdrawn them.

</b>ttAnd my guess is that President
ttEisenhower won't pull out while we

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttFredo.  Where are you going?

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttNowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a
ttrefill.  How about you?

<b>EXT. HAVANA HOSPITAL - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
The ambulance makes its way up to the emergency section of
the hospital.  The orderlies quickly carry the old man
inside.  His wife and the doctor, and several of his men,
follow in another car.

<b>THE VIEW ALTERS
</b>
and we see Bussetta waiting in the shadows.

<b>EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
The growing crowds of Cubans begin their celebration.

<b>NEW VIEW
</b>
A Cuban military detachment speeds along in the night,
motorcyclists clear a path through the celebrants.

<b>INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
A full sitdown dinner is being served the guests.  Michael
sits at a table at dinner with several of the distinguished
Cubans, and some of the American businessmen.

<b>ttttQUESTADT
</b>ttWhat's kept Mr. Roth?

Fredo looks up at Michael.

In the back of the room, we notice the detachment of military
moving quickly through the reception room on their way to
the President's private quarters.  Michael notices it as well.

<b>INT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - FULL VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
The activity at the end of the hall has come to rest; we can
tell that the doctor tells Mrs. Roth that she should go, the
old man will be taken to a room where he can rest.
Gradually, these people leave him in the care of the hospital
staff.

Bussetta watches from the distance of the hallway; after the
old man has been moved, he quietly walks down the hallway to
the room.

<b>HIS VIEW
</b>
A nurse sits in the room in attendance; Hyman Roth is
asleep, his mouth wide open, breathing noisily.

<b>VIEW ON BUSSETTA
</b>
hears footsteps, quickly steps away from the door, and into
another room.

Some nurses and attendants speak to the nurse in the room in
Spanish; one has brought a small bottle of wine, and
obviously they are inviting the nurse to have a New Year's
toast with them.  They laugh; and the nurse steps away from
the room for a moment.

Bussetta moves slowly back into the room, alone with the
helpless Roth.

<b>INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW ON THE GUESTS - NIGHT
</b>
seeing in the New Year; a great banner is hoisted up in
Spanish, welcoming 1959.

Hands are shaken; kisses exchanged.

Michael and Fredo in an embrace; they kiss one another.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI've arranged for a plane; we're

ttto make a big thing of it.

He kisses his brother once again.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttI know it was you, Fredo.  You've
ttbroken my heart.

Slowly, understanding, Fredo backs away from his brother,
taking the kiss another way.

A little distance away, Major Leon notices an old woman, one
of the President's maids, moving across the alcove, carrying
her suitcases.

<b>ttttLEON
</b>ttWhat a pity; she's crying.  Must
tthave been fired, and she's been
ttwith the President's family for
tttwenty years.

<b>EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
The gathered crowd joyously welcomes the New Year.  We
notice the continual military movement.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
A family surreptitiously leaves their home, carrying
suitcases and belongings.

<b>INT. ROTH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Bussetta raises a hospital pillow, and easily begins to
smother the thin old man, who can barely struggle.

<b>OUT IN THE HALL
</b>
A detachment of military move quickly, accompanied by some
of Roth's men, as though they have important news that must
be dealt with.

They pass the small group of aides and nurses welcoming the
New Year.

Seeing them, the nurse assigned to him, puts down her glass
and moves quickly to the room.

She opens the door, and lays bare the sight of Bussetta
smothering Roth.  Bussetta turns quickly; and one of the
military takes out his pistol and shoots several times at
his head.

<b>INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT
</b>
The entire reception has been disrupted for an announcement;
all the guests in their formal dress and evening gowns,
standing with frightened faces like first class passengers
on a doomed ship.  The President himself, his back to our
VIEW, is making an announcement in Spanish.  While he
speaks, we notice continuous movement of his personal staff,
carrying suitcases and possessions.

<b>ttttPRESIDENT
</b>tt...Because of serious setbacks of
ttour troops in Guantanamo and
ttSantiago, we feel reluctantly, that
ttwe must leave the Capital at once.
ttMyself and my family must bid you
ttgoodbye, and good fortune.  We will
ttgo directly to Ciudad Trujillo.

The crowd is stunned; already whispers are moving throughout
the guests.

The only one who is not completely taken off guard is
Michael, who quietly steps back, and disappears from the room.

<b>ttttPRESIDENT
</b>tt...My only regret is that there
ttcould not have been more warning...
ttAs my last official act as
ttPresident, I hereby appoint a
ttprovisional government with Dr.
ttCarlos M. Piedra, as its President.

By now, there is only one thought among the guests: how can
they get out, and with what.

<b>EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT
</b>
We see evidence of the confusion at this late hour; already
cars are beginning to move; people leaving the Palace in
haste.  Michael moves quickly toward his car.  He sees
Fredo, watching him in fear.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttCome with me.  It's your only way
ttof getting out!

<b>VIEW ON FREDO
</b>
Terrified of his brother, and what he knows; Fredo backs
away into the growing noise and confusion of the crowd.

<b>VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
Finally, he has to step into the car and it roars off.

<b>EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
Rebel cars with loudspeakers have already picked up the news
that Batista has conceded...this throws the crowds already
gathered for the New Year into cheers of joy.

They harass a wealthy family who are trying to get away in
their car.

The people pull them out of the car, opening their suitcases,
out of which spill piles of cash and jewelry into street.

Michael's car makes its way as the crowd cheers: &quot;El animale
se fue!&quot;

<b>EXT. THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
Crowds of panicked and frightened tourists, and Batistianos
are trying to get to the safety of the Embassy with the
families and possessions.

We see Geary, and some of the Americans we had met, working
their way through the crowds, shouting that they are
Americans in order to get preference on the line.  Often
that declaration brings 'boos' from the crowds.

Sometimes the joyous Cubans will let a family through, but
again, taking away the suitcases, rich leather, filled with
money and valuables.  Money seems to be stuffed everywhere.

<b>EXT. THE YACHT CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
All forms of private transportation are jammed with people
trying to get out, holding cash in their hands for anyone
with a yacht or small boat to get them to Florida.

A car pulls up; and we see Sam Roth, Terri Roth and some of
their men, carry the sickly, but still alive Hyman Roth to a
private cruiser which is protected by men with machine guns.

Within seconds, they are on their way to Miami.

<b>EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT
</b>
Things are no different at the airport; where anything that
can fly is being jammed with refugees and their money.

A wealthy family is arguing with the pilot of a fast
airplane; trying to force cash on him, and his family into
the plane.  The PILOT steadfastly refuses, although checking
his watch, as though his passengers are late.  He speaks
only English.

<b>ttttPILOT
</b>ttNo, this is a private plane.  No,
ttthis plane is taken.

Finally Michael's Mercury pulls up, and Michael approaches
the Pilot.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHe isn't here.

<b>ttttPILOT
</b>ttWe've got to leave, they'll take
ttthis thing apart.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttAll right.  Go now.

The Pilot lets Michael in, as the Cuban screams curses at
them, and begins searching for another plane for his family.

<b>INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY
</b>
Despite his new position of 'respect,' there is little
changed about his home.  Only that they have lived there a
while now, and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable
possessions a young family acquires.

He kisses his wife, who seems a big apprehensive.  He shows
her the fruit; and from her reaction knows she has something
on her mind.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttWhat is it?

<b>ttttCARMELLA

ttCome...

They step into the tiny parlor, where we see an older woman,

<b>ttttVITO

Vito nods to the frightened old woman.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttIt's done then.  You won't have to
ttmove; I'll speak to him tomorrow
ttmorning.

Carmella breaks into a smile; which her husband des not

The old woman starts to leave the room; but she is not
convinced.

<b>ttttSIGNORA COLOMBO
</b>ttYou're sure he'll say yes, the

<b>EXT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAY
</b>
SIGNOR ROBERTO, a pompous, rather well-dressed Patrone
angrily walks down the steps of one of his tenement buildings.

He carries a check list, and makes marks with a pencil
concerning the condition of his various buildings; a broken
window here, some missing tile there.  He bends over to pick
up some garbage left by a thoughtless tenant, muttering to
himself, when he sees the shoes and legs of a young worker.

<b>ttttVITO (O.S.)
</b>ttSignore Roberto...

He rises to be face to face with a polite Vito Corleone.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttThe friend of my wife, a poor widow

Vito raises his hands in surprise; his voice is reasonable.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttI'm asking you a favor, only that.
ttOne never knows when one might need
tta friend, isn't that true?  Here,
tttake this money as a sign of my
ttgood-will, and make your own
ttdecision.  I won't quarrel with it.
ttt(he puts the money in
tttRoberto's hand)
ttDo me this little favor, just take
ttit and think carefully.  Tomorrow
ttmorning if you want to give me the
ttmoney back, by all means do so.  If
ttyou want the woman out of your
tthouse, how can I stop you?  It's
ttyour property, after all.  If you
ttdon't want the dog in there, I can
ttunderstand.  I dislike dogs myself.
ttt(he pats Roberto on
tttthe shoulder)
ttDo me this service, eh?  I won't
ttforget it.  Ask your friends in
ttthis neighborhood about me, they'll
tttell you I'm a man who believes in
ttshowing his gratitude.

Without a word more, Vito leaves a hypnotized Roberto
standing in front of the tenement, his hand clasping the
money.

<b>EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY
</b>
A thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in
this Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY.

He carries his tools as he comes home from work.  He is
pursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about
his own age, eighteen.

<b>ttttITALIAN BOY
</b>ttKid, where do you live?

<b>ttttANOTHER
</b>ttWhere'd you get those nigger lips?

He tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys,
steps in front of him and stops him.

<b>ttttITALIAN BOY
</b>ttSay 'bread' in Italian.

<b>ttttANOTHER
</b>ttHe dunno.

<b>ttttITALIAN BOY
</b>ttGo on; how do you say 'bread' in
ttItalian?  If you're from the
ttneighborhood, you should know how
ttto say 'bread' in Italian.

An amused Peter Clemenza steps forward from a local coffee
house, to preside over the fuss.  He's a 'big' man in the
neighborhood, and loves a fight.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttWhat's up?

<b>ttttITALIAN BOY
</b>ttThis kid lives around here, but he
ttcan't say bread in Italian.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttThat's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at
ttthose pregnant lips!

He giggles at his own joke.

<b>ttttITALIAN BOY
</b>ttAre you a Jewboy?

The boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.

<b>ttttITALIAN BOY
</b>ttWell, if you're not a Jew, say
tt'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't.

And with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face,
sending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a
clatter.

The other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to
the boy's stomach.  Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold
of his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement
as well.  For a moment, they are rolling around on the
sidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttAlright, alright, cut it out.

<b>ttttSECOND ITALIAN
</b>ttWhat for?  He killed Jesus Christ!

Clemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttI said cut it out!
ttt(to the beaten kid)
ttWhat's your name?

<b>ttttHYMAN
</b>ttHyman Suchowsky.

<b>ttttITALIAN BOY
</b>ttI don't believe it.  In our
ttneighborhood, with a name like that!

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttWhat are those tools?  You work on
ttcars?

<b>ttttHYMAN
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttMaybe I know how you can make a
ttcouple of extra bucks working as a
ttmechanic.

The boy seems agreeable.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttBut you gotta know how to keep your
ttmouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get
ttrid of that name.  I'll call you
ttJohnny Lips.
ttt(he giggles at his
tttown humor again)
ttCome on...

He leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the
side:

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttBread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E,
ttpane.  Don't forget.

<b>INT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
A newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new
product &quot;GENCO PURA&quot; olive oil.  It is the beginning of a
new business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one
rattling old truck, and a few stock boys.

Genco has become the accountant-business manager, based on
the experience working with his father.  But it is clear,
that Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the
new enterprise.

Genco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the
small divided area that Vito uses as his office.

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttThe 'patrone' is here.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttChi?

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttRoberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'

Vito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on
tiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.

<b>ttttROBERTO
</b>ttExcuse me, I hope I am not a
ttdisturbance, Don Corleone.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttROBERTO
</b>ttWhat a terrible misunderstanding.
ttOf course, Signora Colombo can stay
ttin the flat.  Who were those
ttmiserable tenants to complain about
ttnoise from a poor animal...when
ttthey pay such low rent.

Then abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table,
and steps back a respectful distance.

<b>ttttROBERTO
</b>ttYour good heart in helping the poor
ttwidow has shamed me, and I want to
ttshow that I, too, have some
ttChristian charity.  Her rent will
ttremain what it was.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttWhat was that?

<b>ttttROBERTO
</b>ttIn fact, reduced, bu five dollars!

Vito embraces him warmly.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttI accept your generosity...

<b>ttttROBERTO
</b>ttI won't keep you another minute...

He quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then
makes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs,
deflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned
too jelly with fear at his narrow escape.  He all but runs
out of the warehouse.

Genco laughs as he watches.

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttWe won't see him for weeks!  He'll
ttstay in bed in the Bronx!

Clemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic.  We notice
the subtle difference in the way he treats Vito.  He is no
longer a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an
imposing leader.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttThis kid is good with cars; he
ttkiijed at the truck, and says he
ttcan keep it going.

Vito looks over the lanky young man.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttWhat's your name?

<b>ttttHYMAN
</b>ttSuchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky.

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttHe's gonna dump that; I call him
ttJohnny Lips.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttWho is the greatest man you can
ttthink of?

<b>ttttCLEMENZA
</b>ttGo on, answer him when he talks to
ttyou.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi...
ttGaribaldi.

<b>ttttHYMAN
</b>ttArnold Rothstein.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttThen take that as your name: Hyman
ttRothstein.

Genco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttVitone!  Look at this!

Vito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly
christened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind.

<b>EXT. THE ALLEY - DAY
</b>
Genco stands beaming, as two workers raise up high, the
freshly painted sign: &quot;GENCO OLIVE OIL COMPANY.&quot;

<b>ttttGENCO
</b>ttt(enthusiastically)
ttGod bless America!  We're in
ttbusiness!

The young men watch as the sign is hoisted into place.  OUR
VIEW goes from one to the other: Clemenza, Genco, Vito and
Hyman Rothstein.

</b>ttNo, I don't know, explain that

<b>ttttCICCI
</b>ttWhen the boss says push the button
tton a guy, I push the button, see,
ttSenator?

The Senators treat Cicci with a surface courtesy, as if he
were a curious kind of animal, not really human.  Cicci
reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than
he has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a
hypocrisy.

The VIEW ALTERS from Senator Kane to the Committee's
attorney, Mr. Questadt.

<b>ttttQUESTADT
</b>ttYou mean you killed people at the
ttbehest of your superiors?

<b>EXT. THE TROPICANA IN VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A limousine pulls up at a private area near the side of the
hotel.  Michael exits the limousine followed by Hagen and
Neri.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttDo you think they have somebody to
ttback up Cicci?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttNo.  But if they do have somebody,

grouping of me.

<b>INT. CORLEONE APARTMENT AT THE TROPICANA - DAY
</b>
Michael, Hagen, Neri and Rocco are seated in this luxury in
the hotel.  Michael sits in a comfortable chair in his
apartment.  Neri comes and brings him a drink without
asking, but Michael refuses it.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttAl, get me a wet towel.  Does Kay
ttknow I'm back?

Hagen nods.

<b>ttttMICHAEL

</b>ttI took care of it.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWhat was it, so I'll know.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttA little care he can ride in with

Neri comes around with a wet face towel, which Michael uses
to cool his eyes.  He puts the used towel down on the table.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttFellas, can you wait outside a
ttminute?

They know what he means and leave the apartment, going out
to the balcony where we can see them but they cannot hear.
Only Hagen remains.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWhere's my brother?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttRoth got out on a private boat.
ttHe's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a

<b>EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY
</b>
The first snow of the New Year has fallen; the trees are
bare, and there is hush all over this part of the Sierras.
Michael is driven in his car, looking out at the familiar
sight of the home he has been forced to be away from.

<b>VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
looking out from his window.  The last time he had seen the
estate it was warm, and the trees were full.

<b>MOVING VIEW
</b>
approaching the great stone gates; closed.  The bodyguards
are not readily visible, but they are there.  The iron gates
are opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect,
as the car pulls in.

<b>NEW VIEW
</b>
Inside the estate, the private roads have been freshly
plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the
car as it passes.

The Grandchildren are in school now, and so the estate is
especially quiet.  Although there are signs that children
live here; a bicycle, a sled, a swing and gymnastic set, wet
and with a rim of snow still on it.

<b>INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
to the outside, where Michael walks slowly.  He stops and
looks at a little Italian red sportscar made for children.

<b>NEW VIEW
</b>
The front door opens, and Michael enters his own home.  It
is very quiet, no one is at home to greet him.  He can see
the evidence of his family; things his wife and his children
have been using, and left on a sofa or a table.

He moves toward his and Kay's bedroom, where we can HEAR the
SOUND of a sewing machine running.

Quietly he opens the door.

<b>MICHAEL'S VIEW
</b>
into the bedroom.  Kay is sitting by the window, lit by the
cold afternoon light, at work with her sewing machine.  She
hasn't noticed that he's in the room yet, and goes on with
her work.

<b>VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
stands there a moment, watching, not making a sound.  And
then without a word, he steps back, and closes the door, so
that she doesn't see him.

<b>VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE
</b>
onto Michael, moving outside, walking through the snow, he
moves to the house next to his own.

<b>INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
This is the house where Mama lives with Connie's children,
Connie so rarely is there.

He steps in; his mother is asleep in a chair in the living
room.  He moves to her, and bends low, whispers.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttMom... Mom...

She opens her eyes, which are red and small with age.

<b>FULL VIEW IN ROOM - MICHAEL AND HIS MOTHER
</b>
Quietly we HEAR the music of a small band playing an Italian
march.  From the orchestration, we know it is from the past.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. TRAIN STATION AT CORLEONE - DAY
</b>
Vitone and his young family: Mama, Santino, Fredo and the
baby Michael are met at the small station in Sicily by
friends, and Mama's relatives.  There is a small band,
playing for the occasion.  A small man has brought a motor
car to pick the family up; and there are certain dark men,
with shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the
occasion.

The family is helped into the car; the luggage is packed on
the roof, and the car drives off.  The second car, with
bodyguards following.

<b>EXT. DON TOMASINO'S VILLA OUTSIDE OF CORLEONE - DAY
</b>
The villa is bloomed with flowers and DON TOMASINO at this
point is a man in his late twenties.  He embraces Vitone and
pats the heads of his children, and leads them all into the
garden.

<b>INT. THE VILLA - SUMPTUOUS MED. VIEW - LATE DAY
</b>
A sumptuous table is set for the visiting family from
America.  There is a warm atmosphere as Vito, his wife and
children eat.  Tomasino and his family received presents
from Carmella and to Tomasino's mother, and gifts are given
to all of the children.

All typically American representing some of the prosperity
and interests in the consumer goods that followed a great war.

<b>EXT. CORLEONE PLAZA - DAY
</b>
The family exits the church on the plaza of the town.  Vito
shakes hands warmly with the priest.

<b>INT. VILLAGE COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
The door is open -- the footsteps of a man enter the room.
We follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they
belong.  They lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an OLD
MAN.  He sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered
by mosquito netting.

<b>VIEW ALTERS
</b>
and we realize that it is young Vito looking at the MAN.

We remember that the man is MOSCA, one of three men, who
almost twenty years before had hunted down Vito when he was
a boy.  With lightning speed, Vito slashes through the
mosquito netting with a knife.  And with the movement
precise as a butcher's he disembowls this man.

<b>EXT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - FULL VIEW
</b>
Vito has brought his wife and children to see the Olive Oil
Depot which is the link to his New York importing business.
They go inside.

<b>INT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
They are led by one of Vito's associates through rows and
rows of large vats of olive oil.  Vito very proudly shows
his associates in Italy the olive oil can that will be used
in the United States.  They all stand around at the link to
their new importing business and share a toast of wine.

<b>EXT. THE BAY - DAY
</b>
A team of Sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets.
One sings accompanied by a guitar.

<b>VIEW MOVES TO ONE OF THE OLD FISHERMAN
</b>
He is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted
Vito down.  STROLLO.  As he walks we notice there is a
figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels,
it is Vito.  He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old
man.  In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his
throat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little
sound.

Then, almost silently dragging him through the space hidden
by the drying sails.

<b>EXT. THE IMPRESSIVE ESTATE OF DON FRANCESCO - DAY
</b>
We see an old car approach.  Its driver is the young Tomasino.
Sitting in the car with him is Vito.

The car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and
recognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
on an almost decrepit DON FRANCESCO.  He must be in his
early nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as
ever, in his throne-like chair from which he manages the
power as the Mafia Chieftan of this village.  Young Don
Tomasino is speaking.

We notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some
younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders.

<b>ttttTOMASINO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttDon Francesco, if you will honor
ttme, by allowing me to introduce my
ttassociate in America, in New York.
ttHis name is Vito Corleone.

The old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who
has taken the name of this town as his name.

<b>ttttTOMASINO
</b>ttWe will supply him with olive oil
ttexclusively in the town of Corleone.
ttHis company is called the &quot;Genco
ttOlive Oil Company.&quot; Here we have
ttbrought you an indication of how he
ttwill sell the product.

Tomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old
man can look at it.  The old man nods, accepting the notion
of this business.

<b>ttttTOMASINO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttWe have come to ask your blessing

<b>ttttDON FRANCESCO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttHave him come closer, I can't see

Vito takes those several steps, so that he is standing right
in front of the old man.

<b>VIEW ON DON FRANCESCO

ttWhat was your father's name?

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttAntonio Andolini.

<b>CLOSE VIEW ON THE OLD MAN
</b>
The recognition of the name throws a shudder through him.
It is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son
of his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had
tried to wipe out.  The old man raises his feeble hands
signalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts:

<b>ttttDON FRANCESCO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttKill him!  Kill him!

But he is too late; Vito steps forward.

<b>ttttVITO
</b>ttt(Sicilian)
ttIn the name of my Father, and my
ttBrother...

And uses the knife, ritualistically plunging it into the old
man's belly, and then up to his throat, which is severed.

<b>VIEW ON TOMASINO

has drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards,
helping Vito to escape back into the motor car.

Vito manages to pull him up into the car, and they make
their escape.

<b>ttGODFATHER?
</b>
<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt was not an alias.  GODFATHER was
tta term of affection, used by his
ttfriends, one of respect.

<b>ttttSENATOR WEEKLER
</b>ttt(Senator from New
tttYork, very smooth,
tttpartly liberal,
tttTammany Hall)
ttLet me agree with that.  Many of my
ttconstituents are Italian and have
ttbeen honored with that certain
ttfriendship by my close Italian
ttfriends.  Up to this point before I
tthave to leave this hearing to join
ttmy own committee, let me say, that
ttthis hearing on the Mafia is in no
ttway a slur on the Italians by the
ttSenate; nor is it meant to be; nor
ttwill I allow it to be.  Italian
ttAmericans are the hardest working,
ttmost law abiding patriotic Americans
ttof our country.  It is a shame and
tta pity that a few rotten apples
ttgive them a bad name.  We are here
ttto weed those rotten apples out of
ttthe vast healthy barrel of Italian
ttAmericans, who are one of the
ttbackbones of our country.

There is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator
poses for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he
will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttI'm sure we all agree with our
ttesteemed colleague.  Now, Mr.
ttCorleone, you have been advised as
ttto your legal rights.  We have had
tttestimony from a preceding witness
ttwho states you are head of the most
ttpowerful Mafia family in this
ttcountry.  Are you?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttThis witness has testified that you
ttare personally responsible for the
ttmurder of a New York Police Captain
ttin the year 1947 and with him a man
ttnamed Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny
ttthis?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI deny his every charge.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttIs it true that in the year 1950
ttyou devised the murder of the heads
ttof the Five Families in New York,
ttto assume and consolidate your
ttnefarious power?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThat is a complete falsehood.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttIs it true that you own a
ttcontrolling interest in three of
ttthe major hotels in Las Vegas?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThat is not true.  I own some stock
ttin some of the hotels, but only
ttvery small amounts.  I also own
ttsome American Telephone and IBM
ttstock.

Michael had checked this point with Hagen, before answering,
and then once again after the answer.

<b>ttttSENATOR ROGERS
</b>ttWhy is it necessary for your
ttcounsel to advise you on that
ttquestion?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttSenator, I've observed the head of
ttGeneral Motors before a Senate
ttCommittee, and his lawyer whispered
ttin his ear.  That was not commented
ttupon in the way you have just done.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttMr. Corleone, do you have any hotel
ttinterests in the state of Arizona?
ttOr any gambling interests in that
ttstate?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI do not.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttDo you have interests or control
ttover gambling and narcotics in the
ttstate of New York.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI do not.

A pause.  Silence, as the Chairman whispers something to his
assistant.

Tom Hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase, and addresses
the Chair.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttSenator, my client would like to
ttread a statement for the record.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttI don't think that's necessary.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttSir, my client has answered every
ttquestion asked by this committee
ttwith the utmost cooperation and
ttsincerity.  He has not taken that
ttFifth Amendment as it was his right
ttto do, and which because of the
ttextreme legal complexity of this
tthearing, counsel advised him to do.
ttSo, I think in all fairness this
ttcommittee should hear his statement
ttand put it in the record.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttVery well.

At this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the
hearing room.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt(reading)
ttIn the hopes of clearing my family
ttname, in the sincere desire to give
ttmy children their fair share of the
ttAmerican way of life without a
ttblemish on their name and background
ttI have appeared before this
ttcommittee and given it all the
ttcooperation in my power.  I consider
ttmy being called before this
ttcommittee an act of prejudice to
ttall Americans of Italian extraction.
ttI consider it a great dishonor to
ttme personally to have to deny that
ttI am a criminal.  I wish to have
ttthe following noted for the record.
ttThat I served my country faithfully
ttand honorably in World War II and
ttwas awarded the Distinguished
ttService Cross for actions in
ttdefense of my country.  That I have
ttnever been arrested or indicted for
ttany crime whatsoever... that no
ttproof linking me to any criminal
ttconspiracy, whether it is called
ttMafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever
ttother name you wish to give, has
ttever been made public.  Only one
ttman has made charges against me,
ttand that man is known to be a
ttmurderer, arsonist and rapist.  And
ttyet this committee had used this
ttperson to besmirch my name.  My
ttpersonal protest can only be made
ttto the people of this country.  I
ttcan only thank God that in this
ttcountry we have a legal system and
ttcourts of law to protect innocent
ttpeople from wild accusation.  I
ttthank God for our democratic due
ttprocess of Law that shields me from
ttthe false charges made by this
ttcommittee's witness.  I have not
tttaken refuge behind the Fifth
ttAmendment, though counsel advised
ttme to do so.  I challenge this
ttcommittee to produce any witness or
ttevidence against me, and if they do
ttnot, I hope they will have the
ttdecency to clear my name with the
ttsame publicity with which they have
ttnow besmirched it.  I ask this
ttwithout malice, in the interests of
ttfair play.

The television cameras have documented this moment, as Hagen
hands the document over to the committee lawyer.

<b>ttttSENATOR ROGERS
</b>ttWe are all impressed.  The committee
ttwill now recess over the weekend.
ttHowever, it will continue Monday
ttmorning, at eleven a.m.  At that
tttime, this committee will then
ttproduce a witness directly linking
ttMr. Corleone to the charges we have
ttmade.  And then, Mr. Corleone may
ttvery well by liable for indictments
ttof perjury.  However, this document
ttwill be made a matter of record.

A somewhat frightened Fredo Corleone sits in the easy chair
overlooking the lake in this canopied section of the
boathouse.  Rocco sits with him.

</b>
Michael is in the dark room with Hagen and Neri.

<b>ttttMICHAEL

tthad him on possession, dealing in

ttThere's no way we can get to him

<b>ttttNERI
</b>ttThey've got him airtight.  He's in

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWhat does Fredo know?

</b>ttHe says he doesn't know anything,

</b>ttAlright.  I'm going to go outside

<b>EXT. BOATHOUSE FOYER - DAY
</b>
Fredo sits on the couch.  When Rocco sees Michael, he

ttI don't have a lot to say, Michael.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttI know they get Pentangeli, that's

Fredo gets up, walks to the glass panel that separates the
terrace from the lake.

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttI didn't know it was a hit.  I
ttswear to you I didn't know.  Johnny

tthome.  When you visit our Mother, I
ttwant to know a day in advance, so I
ttwon't be there.  Do you understand?

Michael turns, and starts to leave.  A frightened voice
behind him:

<b>ttttFREDO
</b>ttMikey?

Michael doesn't stop, doesn't turn back.  He continues off
through the veranda, and out the summer doors.

Neri stops by him.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI don't want anything to happen to
tthim while my Mother's alive.

Michael leaves.

<b>EXT. ARMY POST - DAY
</b>
Five cars brimming with Army guards and Agents are waiting
to move Pentangeli.  There is one empty car.

<b>INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY
</b>
The two FBI Agents are helping Pentangeli get dressed.  He's
in brightly colored striped shorts and bare-chested.  The
Agents help him with the shirt and tie.  One holds out the
trousers but Pentangeli ignores it and looks at himself in
the mirror.

<b>ttttFBI MAN #1
</b>ttReady, Frankie.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttLet's go.

The Agents open the door, and precede him, surveying the
area.  They check the cars waiting, each with two Agents.
They check the gate and note the military sentries.  Then
they stand aside, and let Pentangeli come out.  They get
close to his side, and it is obvious they will protect his
life with their own.

<b>EXT. ARMY POST - DAY
</b>
The Agents put him in the front seat of the empty car, and
get in with him, one at each side.  Another Agent drives.
Now, the first cars start out; the Sentries opening the
gates, and letting the caravan pass.

An Army supply truck comes very close to them, and the
Agents next to Pentangeli become very tense.  Pentangeli
grins.  Then the truck passes on, and they relax.

<b>INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY
</b>
The room is crowded with TV journalists, cameras, etc.  We
pick Pentangeli up, closely guarded, being led to witness
chair.

Pentangeli is seated, and made to take his oath.  FBI Agents
are all around him.

<b>MED. VIEW
</b>
Anyone given entrance to the caucus room is being frisked.
The five Senators take their places.

<b>VIEW ON HAGEN
</b>
waiting at his long table, very nervous.  He seems startled
by the appearance of Pentangeli.

<b>VIEW ON PENTANGELI
</b>
catching Hagen's eye.  It's as though he is pleading for
some kind of understanding of the fact that he has become a
traitor.

<b>VIEW ON HAGEN
</b>
cold; then he turns away.

<b>VIEW ON THE ENTRANCE
</b>
The bustle is settling down; then Michael Corleone enters,
and with him is someone very peculiar and out of keeping for
this setting.  A burly-chested imposing man of middle age.
Very powerful-looking with frightening magnetic eyes.  His
dress is odd: boots, rough tie, and shirt.  He could be the
tenor out of a Sicilian opera.  He is clearly a country Don,
direct from Sicily, and he dominates the room.

<b>VIEW ON PENTANGELI
</b>
At first his view is blocked.  Then he sees Michael and is a
bit shamefaced, but still defiant.

<b>PENTANGELI'S POV
</b>
Michael returns his glances without emotion.  Then the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the Sicilian.

<b>VIEW ON PENTANGELI
</b>
He is terror stricken; obviously he recognizes the man.

<b>VIEW ON HAGEN'S TABLE
</b>
Michael and the Sicilian sit by Hagen, where they can stare
directly at Pentangeli; he is frozen with fear.

<b>VIEW ON THE SENATOR
</b>
Notices the tension in the room.  The Chairman commences:

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttWe have here a witness who will
tttestify further on Michael
ttCorleone's rule of the criminal
ttempire that controls gambling in
ttthis country and perhaps in other
ttcountries.  This witness had no
ttbuffer between himself and Michael
ttCorleone.  He can corroborate our
ttcharges on enough counts for this
ttcommittee to consider a charge of
ttperjury against Michael Corleone.
ttt(then he turns to Pentangeli)
ttYour name please, for the record.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttFrank Pentangeli.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttWere you a member of the Corleone
ttFamily?  Were you under the
ttCaporegime Peter Clemenza, under
ttVito Corleone, known as the
ttGodfather?

There is a long silence.

<b>VIEW ON PENTANGELI
</b>
He seems unable to speak.

<b>VIEW ON THE SICILIAN
</b>
gazing at him.

<b>VIEW ON PENTANGELI
</b>
<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttI never knew no Godfather.  I got
ttmy own family.

Senator Kane is stunned.  The two FBI men are alert, their
eyes searching the room for what has intimidated their
witness at the last moment.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttMr. Pentangeli, you are
ttcontradicting your confessions to
ttour investigators; I ask you again,
ttwere you a member of a crime
ttorganization headed by Michael
ttCorleone?

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttNo.  I never heard of it.  I never
ttheard of nothing like that.  I was
ttin the olive oil business with his
ttfather a long time ago.  That's all.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttWe have your confession that you
ttmurdered on the orders of Michael
ttCorleone.  Do you deny that
ttconfession and do you know what
ttdenying that confession will mean
ttto you?

The die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will go
all the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the
Senator.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttThe FBI guys promised me a deal.
ttSo I made up a lot of stuff about
ttMichael Corleone.  Because then,
ttthat's what they wanted.  But it
ttwas all lies.  Everything.  They
ttsaid Michael Corleone did this,
ttMichael Corleone did that.  So I
ttsaid, &quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;

He makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of
everybody.

<b>VIEW ON THE FBI AGENTS
</b>
glancing around the room; their eyes have settled on the
Sicilian.  One of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper,
and passes it to the Committee lawyer.  Then in turn it goes
to Senator Kane.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttMr. Hagen, would you kindly identify
ttto this committee that gentleman
ttsitting on your right hand?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt(coolly)
ttYes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo
ttPentangeli.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttIs he related to the witness?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttHe is, I believe, a brother.

<b>VIEW ON MICHAEL AND VINCENZO PENTANGELI
</b>
They wait with no expression.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttt(to Vincenzo Pentangeli)
ttSir, I would like you to take the
ttstand.

Vincenzo stares at him, uncomprehending.  There may just be
a shadow of contempt.  He doesn't answer.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttSir, the gentleman does not
ttunderstand English.  He would not
ttin any case, take the stand.  He
ttcame, at his own expense, to aid
tthis brother in his trouble.  He is
ttnot under any jurisdiction of our
ttgovernment and his reputation in
tthis own country is impeccable.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttt(furious)
ttThe witness is excused; take him out.

The guards and FBI Agents quickly remove Pentangeli, as
everybody else in the room is required to sit still.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttSenator Kane.

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttThis meeting is adjourned.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt(rising and shouting)
ttThis committee owes an apology!

<b>ttttSENATOR KANE
</b>ttThe committee is adjourned until
ttfurther notice.

For the first time, in the midst of the confusion, Hagen
smiles.  A bitter, contemptuous smile.

<b>INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - WASHINGTON HOTEL - DAY

Michael is sitting in an easy chair; he seems to have
difficulty with his eyes.

ttwant to make.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI think it's too late for changes,

ttwouldn't talk about it and I've
ttgone and spoiled it.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWhy too late?

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttTell me, Michael.  What really
tthappened with Pentangeli?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHis brother came to help him.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI didn't even know he had a brother.
ttAnd where is he now?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttOn a plane back to Sicily.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAnd that's all he had to do.  Just
ttshow his face.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThat's all.  You see, in Sicily, in
ttthe old days... there was only one
ttlegitimate reason to kill a blood
ttrelative... only one.  IF he was a
tttraitor.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou would have killed his brother?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttKay, you've got it wrong.  That
ttkind of thing's all over, I promised
ttyou.  This was between the two
ttbrothers.  Years ago Frankie had a
ttyoung girlfriend; he called her his
ttco-wife.  That was his joke, but he
ttmeant it.  He wouldn't divorce his
ttwife... because she was a great
ttcook.  He said he girlfriend made a
ttspaghetti sauce once and it was so
ttterrible he knew he could never
ttmarry her.  He set her up in a
tthouse in Jersey.  She had to be
ttfaithful... and she had to have kids.
ttAnd she did, two, a boy and a girl.
ttHe had her checked out and watched
ttso she couldn't cheat... but the
ttgirl couldn't stand that kind of
ttlife.  She begged him to let her go.
ttHe did.  He gave her money and made
tther give up the kids.  Then Frankie
tttook them to Italy, and had them
ttbrought up by his brother Vincenzo.
ttWhere he knew they'd by safe.

Kay begins to realize.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWhen he saw his brother in the
tthearing room, he knew what was at
ttstake.
ttt(pause)
ttI don't think Vincenzo would have
ttdone it.  He loves the kids, too.
ttOmerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It
tthad nothing to do with me.  It was
ttbetween those brothers.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttI'll bring the children up now;
ttthey want to say goodbye.

</b>ttKay, I told you...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo, I don't want to hear anything.
ttThere are things between men and

ttand I love you and I will not let
ttyou leave, because you are MINE!

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttOh, I do feel things for you,

</b>ttIf that's what it takes; then yes,
ttI will.

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttAt this moment, I feel no love for

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWe'll go back tonight.  Bring the

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttYou haven't heard me.

He moves to her; he does love her, and is tender with her.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHow can I let you leave; how can I

ttDon't you know me?  You understand,

ttI CAN change; that I have learned,

<b>ttttKAY
</b>ttIt wasn't a miscarriage.  And you
ttwith your cunning, couldn't you
ttfigure it out!  It was an abortion;
ttan abortion, like our marriage is
ttan abortion, something unholy and
ttevil.  I don't want your son; I
ttwouldn't bring another of your sons
ttinto this world.  An abortion,

He had no hint, not in his wildest imagination could he have

He is silent, though raging -- then, with all his passion,
and his strength, he raises his arms, and strikes her across
her neck, literally knocking her down to the floor, and
hurting her badly.

A collection of dark cars and black limousines are gathered
to one side.  A few drivers wait quietly.

And then, to the other extreme of the estate, is a small
grouping of about twenty to thirty people, gathered near
Michael's house.

<b>MED. CLOSE SHOT

Connie Corleone, dressed simply and now showing her age
without the carefully applied makeup which we have been used
to, kneels down before the shrine of Santa Theresa, and puts
down a bouquet of flowers, along with others that have been
placed there.  We see that some have the simple silk ribbon
with the word &quot;Mama&quot; hand-lettered upon it.

Her two children stand close behind her; they had been
raised by their Grandmother.

Connie steps back, and moves through the small group of
friends and relatives, into Michael's house.

Fredo, kneeling by the coffin of his mother in a portion of
the house that has been set aside for the wake.  Fredo
concludes his prayer, wipes away the tears in his eyes and
steps away from the coffin.

He stops when he notices Neri, a little distance away,
looking at him.

</b>
After a moment, he nods respectfully to Fredo, and steps
forward, moving to the old woman's coffin.  Fredo moves to
Hagen, who is there with his wife and children.

We regard this tableau for a long moment.

</b>ttI want to talk to you, Michael.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThe children can stay.

ttPapa was.  And I forgive you, and
ttwant to be close to you now.  Can't
ttyou forgive Fredo; he's so sweet,

Slowly, Michael puts his hand on her hair, and touches her
gently.

Some of the men can be seen in the kitchen, drinking wine,
and talking in low voices.

Fredo is there, broken-hearted over the loss of his Mother;
like some lost child with no friends.

Hagen and Pentangeli outside, by the electric fence.  They

</b>ttt(sadly)
ttYeah, it was once.

They both puff on their cigars.  Pentangeli lets himself be
carried away by thoughts of old days of glory; Hagen thinks
of other days too.

</b>ttt(very gently)
ttThe Roman Empire... when a plot
ttagainst the Emperor failed, the

ttto let their families keep their

</b>ttYeah, but only the rich guys.  The

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttDon't worry about anything, Frankie
ttFive-Angels.

<b>ttttPENTANGELI
</b>ttThanks, Tom.  Thanks.

They shake hands.  The FBI Agents come out to let Hagen out
the gate.  Pentangeli is led back to the house.

<b>ttttFBI MAN #2
</b>ttWe got some nice books.

</b>ttI'm not hungry.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttWell, that's alright... alright.
ttGood.  You'll graduate in another
ttyear, isn't that right?  You know...
ttI never finished college.  I was a
ttgood student, but I never finished.
ttOf course, there was a war then.

Connie approaches them.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttDon't let me interrupt anything,
ttthis will just take a second.  Here.
ttt(she takes out a
tttsmall needle, and
tttbegins to prepare it)
ttYour father has to have his insulin
ttshot.  Why don't you go to your
ttroom and put your things away,
ttAnthony.

She begins to give Michael the shot.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttHurry back; we'll talk.  We'll talk.

Anthony goes on his way to the house with his things.
Connie gives Michael the shot.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttWhenever I see that lake so cold, I
ttthink of poor Fredo, drowned.  Lake
ttTahoe is very cold.  They say if a
ttperson drowns in it, that the body
ttwill remain mid-suspended --
ttperfectly preserved.  Some say it
ttwill remain forever.

She finishes the shot, puts her things away.

<b>ttttCONNIE
</b>ttYour boy will be right back.

She leaves.

<b>VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
Alone in the garden.

OUR VIEW begins to MOVE CLOSER to him.  We begin to HEAR
MUSIC of the forties; happy music, swing music, as we move
CLOSER to Michael.

<b>INT. OLD CORLEONE HOUSE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
SONNY CORLEONE, his arm wrapped around a smiling red-faced
Carlo Rizzi, pulls him into the Corleone dining room.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttHey, who knows my buddy Carlo Rizzi.
ttHere... my brother Fredo, here's my
ttMom.  Mom, whatcha got cooking?
ttAnd Carlo, this is my kid sister
ttConnie.  Here, pull up a chair,
ttCarol is sitting next to Connie.
ttOh, the droopy kid over there is
ttMike.  The college boy.

An older, lanky man enters the room, his arms laden with
presents.  This is TESSIO.

<b>ttttTESSIO
</b>ttBuon Natale, everybody.  Buon
ttNatale...
ttt(he smiles at Tom Hagen)
ttHi, Tom, how's every little thing?

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttt(helping him with the presents)
ttWonderful, Sal.

Now the study door opens, and DON CORLEONE enters.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttIs dinner ready?

<b>ttttMOM
</b>ttTwo minutes.

The Don happily regards his family; his sons and daughters
and even some Grandchildren.  He raises a glass.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttA good life, a long life to all my
ttchildren, and friends.  To my
ttgrandchildren, and those that will
ttbe.  To our family.

They all drink.

They refill glasses; then Tessio proposes a toast.

<b>ttttTESSIO
</b>ttTo our Godfather.

They all drink.

<b>INT. THE DINING ROOM - MED. VIEW - NIGHT
</b>
The family is happily at Christmas dinner.  Don Corleone
seated at the head of the table.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttWhat'd you think of those Japs, eh?
ttThe nerve of those Japs, coming
ttright here in our own backyard
ttdropping bombs!

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttWell, we could have expected it
ttafter the embargo.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttHey!  Expect it or not, those Japs
ttdon't have a right to drop bombs in
ttour backyard.  Whose side you on?

<b>ttttMAMA
</b>ttPlease, do we have to talk about
ttthe war at the table?  On Christmas,
ttmuch less.

<b>VIEW ON MICHAEL
</b>
He has been listening to this discussion.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttPop, I've decided I'm going to
ttenlist.

A quiet hush descends over the table, as though everyone
knows the effect this will have on the old man.  Sonny tries
to make light of it.

<b>ttttSONNY
</b>ttKid, stay in college.  The girls
ttare cuter, if you know what I mean.

<b>ttttHAGEN
</b>ttPop had to pull a lot of strings to
ttget you your deferment.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI never asked for it; I don't want
ttit.

<b>VIEW ON DON CORLEONE
</b>
Disturbed; but wise and prudent.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttMy son wants to talk about this,
ttand so we'll talk, but not at the
ttdinner table.

He rises, and starts across the room toward his study.  Then
he looks back.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttMichael.

He disappears into his study.  Michael rises, glances around.
People are generally tense over the situation.  Michael
follows his father into the study.

<b>INT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
The Don closes the door behind his son, and then moves
across the room.  He stops at the little bar there, and
pours himself a brandy.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttWould you like some?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNo, Dad.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttNow what is this talk about joining
ttthe army?  Eh?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttIt's not talk; I'm doing it.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttYou would risk your life for
ttstrangers?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttNot for strangers; for my country.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttAnyone not in your family, is a
ttstranger.  Believe me, when trouble
ttcomes, your country won't take care
ttof you.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttThat's how it was in the old world,
ttPop, but this is not Sicily.

<b>ttttDON CORLEONE
</b>ttI know.  I know, Michael.  It's
ttChristmas, your brothers and sister
ttare all here -- we are happy.
ttLet's not spoil this.  Go your own
ttway, but when you are ready, come
ttto me the way a son should.  I have
tthopes for you...

</b>
looking at his father with a mixture of great love, and also
fear, and confusion.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttI won't be a man like you.
