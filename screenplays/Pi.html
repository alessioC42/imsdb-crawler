<b>tTITLES EXPLODE TO WHITE
</b>
<b>tSLOW FADE TO:
</b>
tEXTREME CLOSE-UP of MAXIMILIAN COHEN'S eyes popping open.

<b>tINT. MAX'S APARTMENT -CHINATOWN FLAT x96 NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
</b>
tMax jolts his head from his desk and tries to orient him-self 
tin the darkness. He has intelligent eyes set in an exhausted, 
tgood-looking face.

tThen he notices the blood dripping from his nose. Max wipes 
tit.

tMax's voiceover begins:

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.)  
</b>ttMonday, September first. 
ttSix-fifteen.

<b>tINT. BATHROOM - DAWN
</b>
tA pull-string light flips on. Max examines his bloody nose in 
tthe mirror.

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttThe alchemist awakes. 
ttt(Imitating) 
tt"Turn lead into gold, Max, 
ttlead into gold." Today, I find it.

<b>tTIGHT ON
</b>
tMax's hand as three unmarked, circular pills hit his palm. 
tThen, he slams the pills into the back of his mouth.

tMax replaces the cap on a plastic bottle of unmarked 
tprescription drugs. He drinks from the sink and splashes a 
tgenerous amount of water onto his head and face, cleaning his 
tnose.

tHe wipes his nose and examines the last remnants of blood on 
this fingertip. Then, he dips his finger under the tap.

<b>tINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - MAIN ROOM - DAY
</b>
tMax's room is constantly dark because the windows are blacked 
tout. He flips on his desk lamp.

tA tiny ANT crawls across his desk. He looks at it for a moment 
tbefore getting angry and squashing it.

tSitting on the desk are three computer monitors, which Max 
tflips on.

tThen he pops on more lights and more switches. We pull back 
trevealing that Max's apartment looks more like the inside of a 
tcomputer than a human's home.

tThe room is knee-high in computer parts of all shapes and 
tsizes. The walls are covered with circuit boards. Cables hang 
tfrom the ceiling like vines in a Brazilian rain forest. They 
tall seem to be wired together forming a monstrous homemade 
tcomputer.

tThis is EUCLID, Max's creation. The computer is alive with 
tsounds and lights.

tMax works on Euclid with his solder and drill. He cares for 
tthe machine as if it were his dream car

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttHeat's been getting 
ttto Euclid. Feel it most in 
ttthe afternoon when I run the 
ttset. Have to keep the fans on 
ttall night from now on. 
ttOtherwise, everything is 
ttrunning topnotch. The stack 
ttof 286's is now faster than 
ttColumbia's computer science 
ttdepartment. I spent a couple 
tthundred dollars. Columbia's 
ttcost? Half a million? 
ttt(Small snicker) 
ttHa...
<b>t
</b>tMax checks the peephole on His front door. No one is there. He 
tunbolts the five lock and slides into the hall.

<b>tINT. APARTMENJ HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tAs he secures his apartment, a Young girl named JENNA runs up 
tto him. Her MOM, down the hall, looks apologetic.

tJenna's eyes light up and she pulls out her Fisher Price 
tcalculator.

<b>ttttJENNA 
</b>ttMax, Max! Can we do one?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMOM 
</b>ttt(Over and over again) 
ttJenna! Jenna!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttOh, no.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJENNA 
</b>ttWhat's three hundred 
ttand twenty-two times four 
tthundred and ninety-one.
<b>t
</b>tJenna types it into her calculator. Max finishes locking his 
tdoor.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttt(instantly) 
ttOne hundred fifty-eight thousand, 
tta hundred two. Right?

<b>ttttJENNA 
</b>ttt(Eyes light up) 
ttRight.
<b>t
</b>tMax heads down the staircase.

<b>ttttMOM 
</b>ttJenna...
<b>t
</b>tJenna screams after him.

<b>ttttJENNA 
</b>ttOkay, seventy-three 
ttdivided by twenty-two.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttt(instantly again) 
ttThree point three one eight one 
tteight one eight...

<b>tEXT. CHINATOWN - DAY 
</b>tMax watches people bustle through the busy intersections of 
tChinatown. The streets are clogged with people.

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttSomewhere in there. 
ttSomewhere. I know it's right 
ttin front of me. The pattern. 
ttThey say it's chaos, it can't 
ttbe understood, too much 
ttcomplexity.

<b>tEXT. ELECTRONIC MEGADUMP - DAY 
</b>tMax scavenges electronic parts as he carefully navigates an 
tendless dump for old and rotting computers.

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttHistory it's there. 
ttLurking, shaping. 
ttstructuring, hiding, right 
ttbeneath the surface.

tHe unscrews a random IBM Board from a keyboard and slides it 
tinto his pocket.

<b>tEXT PLAYGROUND x96 DAY 
</b><b>tMOVE IN
</b>ton Max looking up at something as he reclines on a public 
tbench.

<b>ttttMAX (V.0.) 
</b>ttThe cycling of disease epidemics, 
ttthe wax and wane of Caribou populations 
ttin the Arctic, sunspot cycles, 
ttthe rise and fall of the 
ttNile and yes! the New York Stock 
ttExchange, they are all the 
ttsame.
<b>t
</b><b>tMOVE IN
</b>ton a tree branch - shaking gently in the wind.

<b>tSLOW DISSOLVE TO EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF STOCK TICKER 
</b>tBright stock quotes drift across the screen.

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttI'll find this structure, 
ttthis order, this perfection.

<b>tINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY 
</b>tMax stares intensely at the ticker on the small TV that sits 
tnext to his monitors.

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttTurn lead into gold. 
ttThe first. Right here. Right 
tthere. With math. The numbers 
ttof the stock market are my 
ttlead. When I find the 
ttpattern, then I will find 
ttgold.
<b>t
</b>tMax watches the right edge of the screen where the numbers 
tappear. He wants to see what's before that edge...

tMax slaps the RETURN button on his computer.

tThe phone starts ringing.
tMax eyes it suspiciously.

tJust then, Euclid starts printing results on an old dot-
tmatrix printer.

tMax suspiciously answers The phone.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttHello?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttWOMAN'S VOICE 
</b>ttMaximilian Cohen, please.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttYeah?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttWOMAN'S VOICE 
</b>ttMr. Cohen?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttWho's this?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttWOMAN'S VOICE 
</b>ttHi. my name is Marcy Dawson. 
ttI'm a partner with the predictive 
ttstrategy firm Lancet-Percy. Can I 
ttspeak with Mr. Cohen, please?

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI told you...
<b>t
</b>tThe printer finishes printing.

<b>ttttMARCY DAWSON 
</b>ttMr. Cohen! How 
ttare you? It's been a long 
tttime. Sorry I haven't been in 
tttouch. But I was hoping you 
ttwould allow me to take you to 
ttlunch tomorrow, say one 
tto'clock?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttSorry, I can't.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCY DAWSON 
</b>ttWe're very anxious to talk 
ttwith you, sir

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI can't.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCY DAWSON 
</b>ttI'm prepared to 
ttmake you a generous...

tMax hurries to wrap up the conversation.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI don't take offers for 
ttmy research. You know that. 
ttSorry, I Couldn't help you.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCY DAWSON 
</b>ttMr. Cohen, give 
ttme a moment...

tBut before Marcy finishes, Max hangs up. He rips off the 
tprintout and heads to the front door.

tHe checks the peephole, His landlady. MRS. OVADIA, is sweeping 
tthe hallway stairs humming a turn-of-the century (the last 
tone, not this one) tune.

tMax waits a moment. He tousles his hair. Then he checks again. 
tShe's gone. He opens his locks and releases several bolts.

<b>tINT.MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tMax locks his front door. Meanwhile, his next-door neighbor, 
tDEVI MINSTRY, a sexy young Indian woman, is just getting home. 
tMax looks away and tries to get his door locked.

tShe's weighted down by a bunch of bags filled with food.

<b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttMax, good! 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttHi, Devi.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDEV1 
</b>ttI grabbed you some 
ttsomosas. 
<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttGreat.
<b>t
</b>tDevi heads over to Max with her bags of food. She looks up at 
tMax.

<b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttYour hair.
<b>t
</b>tDevi hands the bags to Max. Then she goes to pat down his 
tHair. Max retreats.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttWhat are you doing?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttYour hair, you can't go 
ttout like that. Don't worry. 
<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttIt's fine. It's fine.
<b>t
</b>tDevi pats down his hair. Max is humiliated. 
<b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttYou need a mom.
<b>t
</b>tMax hands back the bags and heads quickly for the stairs. 
<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI have to go.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttYour somosas!
<b>t
</b>tAn embarrassed Max takes the bag.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttThanks.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
tAt the counter, Max stirs cream into his coffee. Then he takes 
tthree pills from the plastic bottle and drops them in his 
tcoffee.

tMax flips past a full-page ad in the paper that reads 
<b>tLANCET-PERCY 86% ACCURACY (ONLY GOD IS PERFECT). 
</b>tMax flips the page before he or we can absorb it. He compares 
tstock quotes in the Wall Street Journal against his printout.

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttSixteen, twenty-seven. Results: Euclid 
ttshows tomorrow's Dow closing 
ttup by four points. Anomalies 
ttinclude PRONET at sixty-fire 
ttand a quarter, a career high. 
ttPossible explanations, either 
ttA, an error in the June fifth 
ttalgorithm, or B, Euclid's 
ttmain processor is running a 
ttrecursion...

tMax marks up the paper with lines and diagrams as he ponders 
this bits and misses.

tThen a puff of cigarette smoke drifts by and succeeds in 
tbothering Max. He fans it away whenx97

<b>ttttVOICE FROM OFFSCREEN 
</b>ttOh sorry, am I bothering you?
<b>t
</b>tMax shrugs and looks over.

tThe voice belongs to LENNY MEYERx97a bearded man in his late 20s 
tsucking on a cigarette.

tOn closer inspection, something is off. It seems that Lenny is 
tan Orthodox Jew. His yarmulke sticks out Slightly from his 
twide-brimmed hat and the fringes from his tsi-tsis hang out 
tfrom the bottom of his untucked shirt.

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttI'll put it out. 
ttt(Which he does) 
ttThe name's Lenny Meyer
<b>t
</b>tLenny sticks out his hand. Max responds with a small nod. 
<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttAnd you are?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttMax.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttMax? 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttMax Cohen.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttCohen! 
ttt(Judging) 
ttJewish? 
tMax shrugs and turns back to his work.

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttIt's okay. 
ttt(Joking) 
ttttI'm a Jew, too. 
ttt(Serious) 
ttttDo you practice?

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttNo, I'm not interested 
ttin religion.

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttHave you ever 
ttheard of Kabbalah?


<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttJewish mysticism.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI'm sorry, I'm very busy.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttI understand...it's just that 
ttit's a very exciting time in 
ttour history. Right now is a 
ttcritical moment in time.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttt(Sarcastic) 
ttReally?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttYes, it's very exciting. 
ttHave you ever put on Tefillin?

tMax has no idea what Lenny's talking about. Lenny pulls a 
tleather box with black leather straps from his pocket.

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttTefillin. You know Tefillin. 
ttI know it looks strange. 
ttBut it's an amazing 
tttradition that has a 
tttremendous amount of power. 
ttIt's a mitzvah for all 
ttJewish men to do. Mitzvahs, 
ttgood deeds, are spiritual 
ttfood for our hearts and our 
ttheads.

tAnd then Max notices that his thumb is twitching He grabs it 
tself-consciously.

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttThey purify us and bring us 
ttcloser to God. You want to try it?

tJust then, Max pays his bill and prepares to leave.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI gotta go...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttAre you okay? Max? Max?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI'm sorry, bye.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttWell, maybe some other time.
<b>t
</b><b>tINT. MAX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
</b>tMax splashes water on his face.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttPlease God, Let it be a 
ttsmall one.

tHe pulls a metal vaccinating gun out of the medicine cabinet. 
tThen be loads it with a small bottle of medicine. He rolls up 
this sleeve, dabs alcohol on his arm, and fires the gun into 
this arm.

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttSixteen thirty-five. 
ttSecond headache in under 
tttwenty-four hours. They're 
ttgetting more frequent 
ttnow...more painful, too. Drugs 
ttdon't work, just take the 
ttedge off of it. Just gotta 
ttwait for the nosebleed. 
ttRelief comes from my nose.
<b>t
</b>tNext door, he hears Devi and her boyfriend talking.

<b>ttttFARROUHK (O.S.) 
</b>ttSo I gotta make this drop off 
ttin Harlem and on the way down 
ttthere's these three kids 
tthailing me.

tMax slaps himself in the face a few times.

<b>ttttDEVI (O.S.) 
</b>ttYou stopped?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttFARROUHK (O.S.) 
</b>ttI was tight, so...
<b>t
</b>tMax watches his thumb twitch. And then pain shoots through 
thim. He grabs the right side of his head, massages it, and 
tpushes it in with his fingers.

tIn the mirror, he examines the right side of his scalp. He 
tsees nothing

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttAhh...
<b>t
</b>tMax walks back into the 
<b>tMAIN ROOM
</b>
tand sits down in a chair. The lamp is blinding so he
tsnaps it off. Only the bathroom light lights the room. He 
ttakes a few breaths.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttLeave me alone.
<b>t
</b>tHis neighbors conversation begins to build in volume
tand distortion.

<b>ttttFARROUHK (O.S.) 
</b>ttSo I drop them off in the 
ttVillage and they dart.

<b>ttttDEVI (O.S.) 
</b>ttOh God...
<b>t
</b>tMax gags and rubs his head.

<b>ttttFARROUHK (O.S.) 
</b>ttI get out, grab my bat and 
ttstart running. One of the kids, 
ttmaybe sixteen, I catch a block 
ttlater he's cursing at me, calling 
ttme a Paki bastard. So I whacked him, 
ttright in the head.

<b>ttttDEVI (O.S.) 
</b>ttFarrouhk!
<b>t
</b>tThe pain seems to disappear. Max looks at his hand that was 
trubbing his bead.

tThen he looks at the front door. The doorknob seems to
tmove. 
tSomething begins knocking on Max's door. The knocking gets 
tlouder and louder then the locks begin to unlock.

tFARROUHK's words begin to overpower Max.

<b>ttttFARROUHK (O.S.) 
</b>ttI'm kicking the bastard in the 
ttribs banging his ass, knocking his 
tthead against the curb, harder 
ttand harder, I fucking lost 
ttit. A hot dog guy starts 
ttscreaming "You're cracking his 
ttskull, you're cracking his 
ttskull." So they pulled me off 
ttof him and calmed me down. 
ttCops said he had it coming to 
tthim.
<b>t
</b>tThen something starts pounding the door. The doorknob quivers, 
tthe locks unbolt. The chains are the only thing keeping out 
tthe intruder. The door shakes and the chains are strained.

tMAX is paralyzed with terror.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttNo! No!
<b>t
</b>tAnd then the door smashes open. Blinding light fills the room 
tand we crash into the

<b>tBLINDING WHITE VOID
</b>
tA moment of silence, then we 
<b>tCUT TO 
</b><b>tINT. BATHROOM - DAWN 
</b>tA phone rings incessantly. Max's eyes pop open. He's scrunched 
tup in a corner of the room, squashed beneath the sink.

tHis nose is bleeding.

tMax, crawls into the 
<b>tMAIN ROOM
</b>
tand picks up the phone. He pinches his nose and tilts his head 
tback.

<b>ttttMARCY DAWSON 
</b>ttMr. Cohen. Marcy 
ttDawson here again I was just 
ttlooking over my schedule and 
ttI realized I'll be in your 
ttneighborhood tomorrow around 
ttthree.

tMax heads to the 
<b>tFRONT DOOR
</b>
tand checks the locks. He is barely listening to Marcy

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttt(Groggy) 
ttWho is...
<b>t
</b>tThe locks seem secure.

<b>ttttMARCY DAWSON 
</b>ttMarcy Dawson from 
ttLancet-Percy I'm so anxious 
ttto meet you. It will be worth 
ttitx97for both of us I promise. 
ttSee you at your house at 
ttthree, okay?

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttMy house...how do...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMARCY DAWSON 
</b>ttOh, don't worry, 
ttI got your address from 
ttColumbia. So three it is. 
ttLooking forward to it.

tMax tries to stop her but, before he can Marcy hangs up.
tA bewildered Max slowly hangs up.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttDamn.
<b>t
</b>tMax checks the peephole - all clear.

tThen, he opens his -

<b>tCLOSET
</b>
twhich is filled with random computer parts and boxes.

tHe pulls a thick neuroscience book from a shelf in the back of 
tthe closet. He almost knocks over an old dusty brass 
tmicroscope on the shelf.

tMax flips through the book. It contains old plates 
tillustrating the brain. Max examines some of the diagrams.

tEXT. S0L'S HALLWAY - DAY Max rings the bell on an apartment 
tdoor.

tA few moments pass, and then SOL ROBESON opens the door.

tSol is a wise-looking man in his early 70's. He walks with 
tdifficulty, leaning out of breath on a wooden cane.

tHis arms are covered with faded Russian prison tattoos and he 
tspeaks with a thick Eastern European accent, He's happy to see 
tMax.

<b>ttttS0L 
</b>ttMax! How are you7
<b>t
</b>tMax is happy to see Sol, but he's a bit bashful and 
tintimidated.

ttttMAX Okay.

<b>tEXT. SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER 
</b>tTIGHT ON the Japanese game of Go being played. Sol is white 
tand Max is black. Sol's moves are secure and controlled while 
tMax is hesitant.

<b>ttttSOL 
</b>ttStop thinking, Max, just 
ttfeel. Use your intuition. 
ttIt's the only way to get into 
ttthe flow. 
ttt(Beat) 
ttWhat did you think of Hamlet?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI didn't get to it.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSOL 
</b>ttIt's been a month. 
ttt(Knowingly) 
ttYou haven't taken 
tta single break.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI'm so close, Sol. I'm 
ttso close but I just can't 
ttgrab it.
<b>t
</b>tSol changes the subject. He feeds his goldfish and points to 
tone of them.

<b>ttttSOL 
</b>ttHave you met the new 
ttfish my niece bought me? I 
ttnamed her Icarus. After you. 
ttMy renegade pupil. You fly 
tttoo high, you'll get burned.
<b>t
</b>tMax looks up at Sol.

<b>ttttSOL 
</b>ttThe more I see you, the 
ttmore I see myself thirty 
ttyears ago. My greatest pupil. 
ttPublished at 16, Ph.D. at 20.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttWe'll see.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSOL 
</b>ttBut life isn't just 
ttmathematics. I spent forty 
ttyears looking for patterns in 
ttPi, I found nothing.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttYou found things...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttSOL 
</b>ttI found things, but not a 
ttpattern.

<b>tINT. MOVING TRAIL - DAY
</b>
tMax sits in the corner of a rickety New York City subway car. 
tThe train is almost completely deserted.

tMax looks down at his hand. He opens his palm and reveals a 
tblack Go chip.

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttTuesday, September 
ttsecond, eighteen twelve. If 
ttSol hadn't gotten sick who 
ttknows where math would be. He 
ttspent years in the numbers of 
ttPi. Searching for meaning, for 
ttorder.
<b>t
</b>tMax notices a SKINNY MAN in a business suit staring at him. 
tThe man catches Max's eye and looks away, but then he quickly 
tlooks back, making Max turn away.

tHe looks down at his Wall Street journal and draws a circle 
twith its diameter then he writes "A=pir2" and "C=2pir." Next 
the writes "pi=3.14159..."

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttThree point one 
ttfour...off into infinity 
ttand maybe insanity. Somewhere 
ttin there he wanted sanity. 
ttSanity like he found in the 
ttcircles Pi represented. 
ttSimple, sane circles. If only 
ttthe stock market had circles. 
ttSome type of sanity. Some 
tttype of form, of shape.

tSuddenly, Max hears someone singing. Max looks up. It is the 
tSkinny Man and he's singing with passion. It's all very 
tstrange to Max, who nervously looks away.

tAnd then the singing stopsx97
tmid-verse Max looks up and the man is gone. Vanished. Max 
tlooks aroundx97no one in Sight.

<b>tINT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - DAY
</b>
tMax heads up the stairs to his apartment. Just then, a toy 
tSLINKY appears from nowhere marching down the stairs.

tMax stops and waits until the Slinky hits his foot. He picks 
tit up and looks at it.

tHe looks around wondering what's going on. Then Jenna leans 
tout over a railing and starts laughing at Max.

<b>tINT. COFFEE SHOP-DAY
</b>
tMax sits at the counter frantically looking at the Wall Street 
tJournal. He plops three pills into his coffee.

tHe draws circles and other shapes across the page.

tMax is interrupted by a puff of smoke. At the same time, 
tsomeone touches his shoulder and says:

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttHey, Max, how you doing?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttOh, okay.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttLenny Meyer. 
ttt(Motioning to the cigarette) 
ttI'll put it out. 
ttt(Which be does) 
ttSo, what do you do?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttUm, I work with computers 
tt...math.

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttReally? What type of math?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttNumber theory. Mostly 
ttresearch.

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttNumber theory? No 
ttway, I work in theory, too. 
ttNot traditional, though...
ttt(Points to his yarmulke) 
ttI work with the Torah. 
ttt(Awed by the coincidence) 
ttAmazing.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttt(Passing it of as a coincidence) 
ttYeah...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLENNY MEYER
</b>ttYeah. You know Hebrew is 
ttall numbers. It's all math.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttHm.
<b>t
</b>tLenny pulls out a worn' dog-eared Bible from his pocket. There 
tare paper slips marking what seems like every other page. When 
the opens it up,
tMax sees that the pages are marked up by highlighter pens, 
tnotes and diagrams.

tLenny points to the text. EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Hebrew letters.

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttHere, look...the ancient 
ttJews used Hebrew as their 
ttnumerical system. Each 
ttletter is a number.

tLenny pulls out a pen and grabs Max's Journal. He writes on it 
tas he talks.

tMax traces a big circle on the journal. Then, he cuts it out 
twith an X-acto blade. He cuts out the middle of the circle so

tHe tears part of the loop and stretches the circle out in

tDevi and Farrouhk are still at it.

tMax puts on a pair of latex gloves. He dons a surgical mask. 
tHe climbs up to a loft above his monitors. A glass case, fed 
tcool air by a vent tube, encases some computer parts. He 
tcarefully removes the front glass cover.

</b>tSol and Max sit on either side of a half-played Go board.

<b>ttttSOL 
</b>ttListen to me. The Ancient 
ttJapanese considered the Go 
ttboard to be a microcosm of 
ttthe universe. Although when 
ttit is empty it appears to be 
ttsimple and ordered, in fact, 
ttthe possibilities of game play 
ttare endless. They say that no 
tttwo Go games have ever been 
ttalike. Just like snowflakes. 
ttSo, the Go board actually 
ttrepresents an extremely complex 
ttand chaotic universe. That is 
ttthe truth of our world, Max. 
ttIt can't be easily summed up 
ttwith math. There is no simple 
ttpattern.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttBut as a Go game 
ttprogresses, the possibilities 
ttbecome smaller and smaller. 
ttThe board does take on order. 
ttSoon, all moves are 
ttpredictable.

<b>ttttSOL
</b>ttSo?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX
</b>ttSo, maybe, even though we're not 
ttsophisticated enough to be aware 
ttof it, there is an underlying 
ttorder...a pattern, beneath every 
ttGo game. Maybe that pattern is 
ttlike the pattern in the market, 
ttin the Torah. The two sixteen 
ttnumber.

<b>ttttSOL 
</b>ttThat is insanity, Max.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttOr maybe it's genius. I 
tthave to get that number.

<b>ttttSOL 
</b>ttHold on, you have to slow 
ttdown. You're losing it, you
tthave to take a breath. Listen 
ttto yourself. You're connecting 
tta computer bug I had, a 
ttcomputer bug you might have 
tthad, and some religious 
tthogwash. If you want to find 
ttthe number two sixteen in the 
ttworld, you'll be able to pull 
ttit out of anywhere. Two 
tthundred and sixteen steps 
ttfrom your street comer to 
ttyour front door. Two hundred 
ttand sixteen seconds you spend 
ttriding on the elevator. When 
ttyour mind becomes obsessed 
ttwith anything, it will filter 
tteverything else out and find 
ttexamples of that thing 
tteverywhere. Three hundred and 
tttwenty, four hundred and 
ttfifty, twenty-three. 
ttWhatever! You've chosen two 
ttsixteen and you'll find it 
tteverywhere in nature. But 
ttMax, as soon as you discard 
ttscientific rigor, you are no 
ttlonger a mathematician. You 
ttbecome a numerologist. What 
ttyou need to do is take a 
ttbreak from your research. You 
ttneed it. You deserve it 
ttHere's a hundred dollars, I 
ttwant you to take it. If ,you 
ttwon't take it, borrow it. 
ttEither way, take a break.

<b>t

</b>ttGood. It's funny, 
tteven though we have different

ttwe're actually incredibly

ttclearly we're seeking 
ttdifferent types of 
ttperfection, but that is what 
ttmakes us perfect candidates 
ttfor a fruitful partnership. 
ttIf you let me, I can be your 
ttgreatest ally. Take the 
ttacacia tree...in East 
ttAfrica. It is the most 
ttprevalent plant in all of 
ttKenya because it has managed 
ttto secure its niche by 
ttdefeating its major predator, 
ttthe giraffe. To accomplish 
ttthis, the tree has made a contract 
ttwith a highly specialized red ant. 
ttThe tree has evolved giant spores which 
ttact as housing for the ants 
ttIn return for shelter, the 
ttants supply defense. When a 
ttgiraffe starts to eat the 
tttree's leaves, the shaking 
ttbranch acts like an alarm. The 
ttants charge out and secrete an 
ttacid onto the giraffe's 
tttongue. The giraffe learns its 
ttlesson and never returns. 
ttWithout each other, the tree 
ttwould be picked dry and the 
ttants would have no shade from 
ttthe brutal African sun Both 
ttwould die. But with each 
ttother, they succeed, they survive, 
ttthey surpass. They have 
ttdifferent aims, different 
ttgoals but they work together.

tThe station is strangely silent. It is also extremely rundown. 
tThe tracks are rusted and fucked up. All we hear is the sound 
tof DRIPPING WATER. The sound is warped and grows and morphs 
tuntil it's downright scary.

tMax sits on a bench sucking down pills. His head begins to 
thurt. He touches the right side of his scalp and nubs it.

tAs the blood surges through his head it brings him waves of 
tpain. He gags several times. Then the pain lets loose and all 
tMax wants to do is die. He smashes the side of his head with 
this fist.

tAcross the tracks on the far platform he sees someone.

tFor a moment Max's pain dissipates. His view is obscured by 
tthe columns. Max gets up and sees the Young Hasidic Man - from 
tearlier - staring at him.
tThe Man stares at Max without any emotion. Max notices blood 
tdropping from the Man's right hand.

tMax looks at the Man's face and sees for a split second his 
town face staring back.

</b>ttHey!

tThe Man is gone. A pool of blood sits where the Man was. Max 
ttouches it with his toe. It's sticky. He notices a trail of 
tblood leading off from the pool.
tHe follows it around a corner where it leads into a corner.

tHe notices something strange in the shadows. He carefully 
tadvances on it. Hiding in the shadows is what looks like a 
tsmall piece of brain. It seems to be moving slightly.

tMax uses a pen in his jacket to carefully touch it.

tSuddenly, Max hears a train's HONK HONK behind him. Max spins 
taround. Nothing is there but silence.

tHe turns back to the gray matter. He touches it again. Once 
tagain, he hears the deafening HONK HONK. Max spins around, but

tmoves and he realizes that the magnification can be changed.

tA KNOCK again.

tMax looks out the peephole and sees nothing. Confused,

</b>ttThe most I can

ttSchneider's class. That 
ttbullshit core for majors. 
ttSchneider's fascination with 
ttmystical geometry made him a 
ttbit of a quack...but...then again, 
ttlook at Kepler. He was really into 
ttPythagoras. The leader of an 
ttancient sect which believed 
ttthe entire universe could be 
ttrepresented by numbers. 
ttPythagoras' greatest contribution

tThe rectangle fits perfectly over Leonardo Da Vinci's Man.

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.) 
</b>ttIf you take the 
ttwidth of this rectangle and 
ttuse it to form a square within 
ttthe rectangle, the part left 
ttover is a rectangle that has 
ttthe same ratio as the 
ttoriginal rectangle. au can 
ttcontinue squaring the 
ttrectangle, over and over

ttrectangles smaller and smaller 
ttto infinity.

tTIGHT ON MAX squaring rectangle after rectangle. Then he draws 
tthe golden spiral through the rectangles.

<b>ttttMAX (V.0.) 
</b>ttThen, if you

<b>t
</b>tSo he takes out a scissors and starts removing some hair.

tMeanwhile his neighbors' lovemaking gets more intense. Their 
tscreams carry into Max's head.

tMax finishes removing a patch of hair from the right side
tof his head. He has uncovered a light scar on his head. He 
texamines it in the mirror.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttWhat is it!? What is it!?
<b>t
</b>tThen his neighbors' lovemaking turns outright evil. It
tsounds like Sodom and Gomorrah next door and Max
tcan barely stand it.
tA jolt of pain surges into his head. He grabs his scar as he 
tvomits blood into the sink.
tHe starts banging his head against the mirror. He bangs
this head again and again until the mirror CRACKS!

tHis neighbors are cumming and their cries of joy are twisted 
tand agonizing.

tThe mathematician looks at himself and begins to sob. He 
treloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head, 
twhere the pain is coming from.

tMax collapses to the ground in complete agony until the bare 
tbulb in the bathroom starts blinking on and off.

tSuddenly the pain is gone.

tThen he hears something. It's Euclid, buzzing with life. He 
tgets to his feet and head's into Euclid.

tThe main monitor is screaming with numbers. The lights in the 
troom flicker on and off like on a disco dance floor. A
tfilo substance billows out of Euclid.

tAnd then a number pops onto the screen. Max estimates how many 
tdigits are on the screen. 
<b>ttttMAX
</b>ttTwo...two hundred. That's it! That's it!
<b>t
</b>tMax grabs a piece of paper and a pencil. He starts writing 
tdown the number. He mumbles each digit as he sees it.

tBut then be stops writing. Power surge! He stares at the 
tnumber. Something clicks in his head. His eyes go wide. He 
tbarely musters ax97

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttOh...
<b>t
</b>tWe move closer and closer into the number, deeper and deeper 
tinto the screen. Until finally a single pixel fills the screen 
tand we're in the

tBLINDING WHITE VOID where we hear several deep peaceful 
tbreaths. 
tThen, a fuse blows and we cut to:

<b>tBLACK
</b>tA phone ringing...once...
ttwice...then we hear

<b>ttttMRS. OVADIA(O.S.) 
</b>ttHe's alive. His eyes are moving. 
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDEVI (0.S.) 
</b>ttYes, hello?
<b>t

<b>ttttDEVI (0.S) 
</b>ttt(On the phone)
ttHe's busy right now I'm sorry.
ttMax is sprawled out in front 
ttof Euclid. A large amount of 
ttblood, from his nose, is 
ttsemi-dried on his chin and 
ttchest. Devi hangs up the phone.

tThe landlady, Mrs. Ovadia, and Farrouhk, brandishing a 
tcrowbar, stand over him.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttWhat happened?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttYou were screaming...

<b>ttttFARROUHK 
</b>ttt(To Mrs. OVADIA)
ttShhh!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttt(Suddenly jolting up and remembering) 
ttThe number, the number.
<b>t
</b>tMax looks at Euclid. The screen is blank. He looks at the 
tmainframe. It is covered with the filo substance. Then be 
tlooks at the piece of paper he wrote the number on. Only a few 
tdozen numbers are on the page. The last number be wrote is 
tbarely a scribble.

<b>ttttMRS. OVADIA 
</b>ttYou're out, you hear me, you're out. 
ttI've had enough of you. Look at all 
ttthis junk.
<b>t
</b>tHe starts reciting the numbers. Then Max suddenly realizes 
tsomething. He continues reciting the numbers from memory.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttFour...zero...
ttseven...It's in my head, 
ttit's in my head. Somehow I 
ttmemorized it. I got it up 
tthere!
<b>t
</b>tHe points to his head.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttBut what is it?
<b>t
</b>tMrs. Ovadia starts looking at all the junk in the room.

<b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttAre you okay?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMRS. OVADIA 
</b>ttWhat is this stuff? What does it do?
<b>t
</b>tMax finally realizes that all these strangers are in his womb. 
tHe flips.

<b>t
</b><b>ttttFARROUHK

</b>tThe phone starts ringing again.

<b>ttttMRS. OVADIA 
</b>ttThat's it, no way. You're

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttOut! 0utt
<b>t
</b>tThe three neighbors retreat to the front door.

<b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttAre you okay?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttOut! Get out!
<b>t
</b>tMax slams the door in their faces.
tMax rubs his chin and looks around the room. He starts
tsaying the number to himself He gets more and more
texcited as he reads each digit.

<b>tINT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
tMax stirs cream into his coffee. Then he pulls out the
tJournal.

tA phone continues to RING.

tIn the clouds of the Lancet-Percy ad - in The Journal Max 
twrites down the two hundred and sixteen digit number. He 
tstudies it, examines it, draws on it, tries to figure out what 
tit is.

<b>ttttMAX (V.O.)
</b>ttSaturday? Dark outside. There 
ttwas a moment there...when, I don't 
ttknow...when I didn't exist. What? What?

tWe hear a phone being picked up. The ringing stops. Silence, 
tthen:

<b>ttttMARCY DAWSON (O.S.) 
</b>ttMax, is that you? Max? 
ttt(Pleading) 
ttMax, just talk to me. Things

ttdesperate. 
ttt(Suddenly firm) 
ttWe had a deal, Max. A deal. 
ttTalk to us, Max.

tWe hear the sound of a phone hanging up.

tAt the coffee counter, Max pops a handful of pills and 
tcrumples the paper.

<b>tINT. MAX'S BATHROOM - LATER
</b>
tMax stares at his BALD head in the mirror. All of his hair has 
tbeen removed. A fleshy scar sits on his scalp above his right 
tear.

tMax ignores the incessantly RINGING phone.

tMax flips through an old neuroscience book. He examines a few 
tillustrations and finds the part of his brain that's killing 
thim.

<b>ttttMAX (V.0.) 
</b>ttMust be an explanation, must be a 
ttreason. Must.

tWith a thick black marker, he carefully outlines the part of 
this head that is causing the pain.

<b>tINT. MAX'S APARTMENT-LATER
</b>
tMax sits in his chair staring at the stock market monitor. The 
tphone continues to RING.

tNumbers drift by.

tA single beam of sunlight leaks through the window and shines 
ton the edge of the screen. Walking along the edge in the 
tsunlight is a tiny ant.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttBastard.

tMax gets up to squash it. But as he gets closer he suddenly 
tfeels mercy. He looks at the ant in awe.

tAnd then, his attention switches to the ticker.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttTwo and a quarter, twelve 
ttand an eighth, six and two 
tteighths.
<b>t
</b>tMax states the numbers right before they enter onto the 
tscreen.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI know these...Seven 
ttand a quarter. Two and a half 
tt...oh...oh...
<b>t
</b>tMax strains to figure out what is going an. Suddenly, he's

<b>ttttSOL 
</b>ttI gave up before I

ttin a particular loop. The loop 
ttleads to meltdown, but

ttthey become "aware" of

tThrough the open doors, Max notices a YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHER in 
tjeans and a leather jacket photographing him from the uptown 
tplatform.

tMax is enraged and screams at him. The man ducks behind a 
tcolumn, but a few moments later he's back snapping pictures.

tThe doors start to shut, but Max uses his body to get
toff the train.

tThe Photographer sees him coming and flees.

tMax follows the man's movement on his platform. When the young 
tman shoots up the exit stairs, Max does so as well.

tMax catches a glimpse of his foe entering the catacombs 
theading toward Times Square. Max pursues.

tMax chases him down a looooong passage.

tBut he loses him at an underground five-way fork in the road. 
tOne staircase is Uptown and Queens...
tanother is Brooklyn...one other is unlabeled.

tStill enraged, Max marches forward Just then, he catches a 
tglimpse of the Photographer exiting the station.

tIn the heart of New York, Max spins around searching for his

tHis frustration mounts until out of the comer of his eye he 
tsees a strange reflection. Not knowing what it's of, he turns 
taround to see the source The reflection is from a giant, 
tbrilliant stock ticker - 50 yards long and luminous.

tMax stares at the quotes They are hypnotizing and Max is 
tsuddenly calm.

tThen, Max has a premonition. He turns and spots the 
tPhotographer in front of a porn shop on Eighth and 42nd.

<b>tEXT. PORN SHOP - 42ND STREET - NIGHT

</b>ttHere, here.

ttough guy, and they don't look happy. Max spins around and 
tsees Marcy Dawson blocking his exit.

twhimpers.

tThe tough guys chase after him and he gets a bit of a
tlead in the narrow aisles. He pleads with the owners for
thelp - nothing doing.

tJake heads him off and uses his body to block the aisle. But 
tMax grabs a can of beans and slams it down on the tough guy's 
tnose. The guy goes down and Max shoots out the exit.

<b>tEXT. UNDERNEATH CAR - NIGHT

tat him.

tMarcy looks at the guys, who shake their heads. She walks over 
tto Max and shows Max the front page of the Wall Street

</b>ttC'mon, Max. This isn't a

</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttYou wouldn't be so 
ttflipped out if you didn't 
ttknow. What's happening to me?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttGive us the number!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttScrew you!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRAV COHEN 
</b>ttOkay, okay! Lenny, 
tteasy! Max, I'll tell you 
ttwhat's going on. Just calm 
ttdown. 
ttt(Deep breath, then) 
ttThe Talmud tells us it began two 
ttthousand years ago, when the 
ttRomans destroyed the second 
tttemple.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttWhat are you...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRAV COHEN 
</b>ttJust give me a chance. 
ttYou'll understand everything 
ttif you listen.
<b>t
</b>tMax takes out his pills and starts feeding himself some.

<b>ttttRAV COHEN 
</b>ttThe Romans also 
ttmurdered all of our priest-
tthoodx97the Cohanimx97the Cohens, 
ttand with their deaths they 
ttdestroyed our greatest 
ttsecret. In the center of the 
ttgreat temple was the holy of 
ttholies which was the heart of 
ttJewish life. This was the 
ttearthly residence for our 
ttGod. The one God. It 
ttcontained the ark of the 
ttTabernacle which stored the 
ttoriginal Ten Commandments 
ttthat God gave to Moses. Only 
ttone man could enter this 
ttspace once a year on the 
ttholiest day of the year, Yom 
ttKippur On the Day of 
ttAtonement, all of Israel 
ttwould descend upon Jerusalem 
ttto witness the High Cohen's 
tttrip into the holy of holies. 
ttIf the holy man was pure he 
ttwould reemerge a few moments 
ttlater and Israel was secured 
tta prosperous year. It meant 
ttthat we were one yea r closer 
ttto the messianic age. Closer 
ttto the return of the Garden 
ttof Eden. But if he was 
ttimpure, he would die 
ttinstantly and it meant that 
ttwe were doomed. The High 
ttCohen had a single ritual to
ttperform in the holy of holies. 
ttHe had to intone a single 
ttword.

tRav Cohen takes a dramatic pause. Max is anxious to hear the 
tend of the story.

<b>ttttMAX
</b>ttSo?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRAV COHEN
</b>ttThat word was the true name of God.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX
</b>ttYeah...
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRAV COHEN
</b>ttThe true name, which only 
ttthe Cohanim knew, was two 
tthundred and sixteen letters 
ttlong.

tA long beat.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttt(Incredulous) 
ttYou're telling me that the number in 
ttmy head is the name of God!?

tWondrously, Max rubs the scar on his head.

<b>ttttRAV COHEN 
</b>ttt(Passion building) 
ttYes...it's The key into 
ttthe messianic age. As the 
ttRomans burned the temple, the 
ttTalmud says, the High Cohen 
ttwalked into the flames. He 
tttook his secret to the top of 
ttthe burning building. The 
ttheavens opened up and took 
ttthe key from the priest's 
ttoutstretched hand. We've been 
ttsearching for the key ever 
ttsince. And you may have found 
ttit. Now let us find out.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttThat's what happened. I 
ttsaw God.

<b>ttttRAV COHEN 
</b>ttNo, no, Max. 
ttYou're not pure. You can't 
ttsee God unless you're pure.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttIt's more than God...
ttit s everything. It's math 
ttand science and nature...
ttthe universe. I saw the 
ttUniverse's DNA
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRAV COHEN 
</b>ttYou saw nothing.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttI saw everything.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRAV COHEN 
</b>ttThere's much more. 
ttWe can unlock the door with 
ttthe key. It will show God 
ttthat we are pure again. He 
ttwill return us to The Garden.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttGarden? You're not pure. 
ttI'm the one who has the 
ttnumber
<b>t
</b><b>ttttRAV COHEN 
</b>ttWho do you think 
ttyou are? You are a vessel 
ttfrom our God. You are 
ttcarrying a delivery that 
ttneeds to be made to us.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttIt was given to me. It's 
ttpart of me. It's changing me.

<b>ttttRAV COHEN 
</b>ttIt's killing you. 
ttBecause you are impure.

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttIt will kill you!
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttAnd what will it do to 
ttyou?

<b>ttttLENNY MEYER 
</b>ttWe're pure. Give 
ttus the number!

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttThe number is nothing. 
ttYou know that!

<b>ttttRAV COHEN 
</b>ttWe can use it. We 
ttcan wield it.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttIt's just a number. I'm 
ttsure you've written down 
ttevery two hundred sixteen number. 
ttYou've translated all of 
ttthem. You've intoned them 
ttall. Haven't you? But what's 
ttit gotten you? It's not the 
ttnumber! It's the meaning. 
ttIt's the syntax. It's what's 
ttbetween the numbers. If you 
ttcould understand you would. 
ttBut it's not for you! I've 
ttgot it. I understand it. I'm 
ttgoing to see it! 
ttt(Whispers to Rav Cohen) 
ttRabbi...I was chosen.
<b>t
</b><b>tEXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
</b>
tMax races through the streets of New York. He is wide-eyed.

<b>ttttMAX (V.0.) 
</b>ttSuddenly, it's all there. 
ttIt all makes sense. I 
ttcan crack it. I can know it. 
ttI know what it is. Sol knows, 
tttoo. I need to tell him. I 
ttneed to show him. I need to 
ttbring him with me.
<b>t
</b>tPeople fly by. Max in a spiraling whirlwind.

<b>tEXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tA pumped and excited Max paces the hall as he rings the bell.

tThe door opens. But it isn't Sol. It's a young, beautiful 
twoman wearing a simple black dress. Her name is JENNY ROBESON 
tand she is Sol's niece.

<b>ttttJENNY ROBESON 
</b>ttCan I help you?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttt(Confused) 
ttSol?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJENNY ROBESON 
</b>ttWere you a friend?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttWhat do you mean?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttJENNY ROBESON 
</b>ttHe had a second stroke.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttWhere is he?
<b>t
</b>tJenny's eyes drop.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttNo.
<b>t
</b>tMax rushes into Sol s study. The room is covered with Sol's P, 
tresearch books. It seems Sol had recently come out of 
tretirement. Max looks at a few of Sol's books. Then he finds a 
tpiece of paper with Sol's handwriting on it. On the paper is 
tTHE number. Max slides it into his pocket.

tMax looks at the Go board. The pieces are arranged in a giant 
tspiral across the board.

<b>tDISSOLVE TO
</b>
<b>tINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
tMax sits on his bed staring at Sol's handwritten number.
tThen he notices that his thumb is twitching. He drops Sol's 
tnote.

<b>ttttMAX
</b>ttStop it, please!

tHe dumps the contents of the bottle of pills into his hand.

tMax stops as he prepares to shove the pills down his throat. 
tHe looks at the pills. Then he looks at Euclid around him. He 
tthrows the pills and the bottle to the floor. They fall to 
tearth in SLOW MOTION.

tThe room rushes in on Max and so does the pain. It throws him 
tto the ground and he bashes his head against the floor.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttt(Courageously) 
ttNo. No. I'm ready. I'm 
ttready! Show me!

tMax recites THE number and uses it to get to his feet. The 
tpain rips apart his voice.

tMax's pain and anger transform into violence. He attacks 
tEuclid furiously. He recites the number with rage in his 
tvoice.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttThree, seven, two...
<b>t
</b>tHe smashes the old computer apart. He tosses his step stool 
tthrough the mainframe.

tThen he goes to the window and tries to rip off the cardboard 
tcovering the glass panes. Nothing doing, so he yanks the 
tentire window wide open.

tSunlight floods the room and throws Max into the 
<b>tBLINDING WHITE VOID 
</b>twhere Max looks around starry-eyed. The pain is gone. 
tEverything is new to Max - even his hands. The stress leases 
tfrom his brow and his shoulders sag.

tMax continues to recite the number His voice becomes tender 
tand peaceful. As he starts to become part of the void, his 
tvoice turns into a whisper and his eyes start to close.

tThen he hears Devi.

<b>ttttDEVI (O.S.) 
</b>ttMax. Max! Are you 
ttokay!? Oh my God, Max!

tHer voice reaches into the void.

<b>ttttDEVI (O.S) 
</b>ttMax! Breathe, Max. Breathe!
<b>t
</b>tMax looks toward her voice.

<b>ttttDEVI (O.S.) 
</b>ttYes, Max. Listen to me...
<b>t
</b>tWe cut back to 
<b>t...THE MAIN ROOM 
</b>twhere Devi leans over Max. Max's eyes are open while he 
tcontinues to recite the number.

<b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttBreathe, Max! Breathe. 
ttFocus.

tMax turns away from Devi and we return to the 
<b>tBLINDING WHITE VOID 
</b>twhere Max continues to recite the number.

<b>ttttDEVI (O.S.) 
</b>ttNo, Max. No. 
ttStay with me Max. Stay with 
ttme. 
<b>t
</b>tAnd then we cut back to 
<b>tTHE MAIN ROOM 
</b>twhere Devi grabs Max's palm. Max's fingers wrap around her 
thand. We return to 
<b>tTHE BLINDING WHITE VOID 
</b>twhere Max stops reciting the number. He suddenly opens his 
tfear filled eyes.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttWhere am I? What is 
ttthis? This is wrong, Sol. 
ttSol!
<b>t
</b>tMax lets out a 'SOL!, and reaches out into the void. We match 
tcut back to 
<b>tTHE MAIN ROOM
</b>
twhere Max grabs Devi and hugs her. He gasps for air as
the collapses into her arms, sobbing.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttSol! You were right Sol! 
ttHe was right.

<b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttThat's right Max. That's 
ttRight. Breathe. Breathe.

<b>ttttMAX 
</b>ttHe was right. I want to 
ttbreathe. Breathe.

<b>ttttDEVI 
</b>ttYes, breathe, Max. 
ttBreathe...

tMax sobs. He holds onto her for dear life

tAnd then be realizes that Devi is not in his arms. He is 
tholding onto himself.

tThen Max notices Sol's note on the ground. He looks at the 
tnumber. He collects himself and catches his breath.

<b>tINT. MAX'S BATHROOM x96 DAY
</b>
tMax looks at Sol's note. He lights a match and burns it.

tNext, he prepares something in the sink.

tWe hear the WHINE of a motor. Then it stops, Max looks at 
thimself in the mirror, He smiles. Then he gets solemn.

tHe takes a deep breath. Then we hear the motor again. Max 
tlifts up his arm. He's holding a drill. He places the bit 
tagainst the math section of his scalp.

tHe applies pressure and drills into his brain.

tMax collapses as we quickly 
<b>tCUT TO

</b>
<b>tTIGHT ON
</b>ta tree branch gently blowing in the wind.

tMax watches it with peaceful, understanding eyes. He wears a 
that on his head.

tHe listens to the wind in the trees.

tJust then, Jenna surprises him with her Fisher Price 
tcalculator on hand.

<b>ttttJEHNA 
</b>ttMax, Max!
<b>t
</b>tMax smiles at Jenna. He's glad to see her.

<b>ttttJENNA 
</b>ttCan we do one, Max, can 
ttwe?

tMax shrugs, not able to say no.

<b>ttttJENNA 
</b>ttHow about two hundred 
ttand fifty-five times a 
tthundred and eighty-three.
<b>t
</b>tJenna types m the number.

tMax is about to say "no" to Jenna, but then be decides to give 
tit a shot.

tMax thinks, he really thinks.

tJenna presses the EQUALS button.

</b>ttI got it! I got it!
