<pre>


<b>INT. ROOM - DAY  (EFX)
</b>
GIDEON, a strongly built elderly black man, is sitting at a
table. On the table is a large bowl of fruit. A crocheted
tablecloth hangs over the side of the table. Gideon is
dressed in a white suit and wearing a pair of well-polished
wing-tip shoes. His hat almost covers his eyes, which are two
points of greenish coals. The fruit in the bowl is engulfed
in flames.

The flames look as if they are DRIPPING from the tablecloth
to the floor. Gideon's shoes start to SMOULDER. His shoes
BURST INTO FLAMES which spread up his pants leg. His head
falls forward as if he had suddenly fallen to sleep. He
twiddles his thumbs very slowly in a circle. He crosses his
legs as if to get comfortable.

The camera moves to a CLOSE UP of his burning shoes. The
image of his feet begins to appear through his shoes; the
flames fade; the background changes as we

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. GIDEON'S BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Gideon's bare feet are resting on reddish dry earth. Gideon
is sitting in his backyard under a fruit tree with a Bible
resting in his hands.

His house is a small, neatly painted bungalow in South
Central Los Angeles. Corn, tomatoes, other vegetables grow in
the yard. Chickens scratch around.

He slowly awakens; his hands are trembling. He looks around
and sees the chickens. He looks up at the sky and sighs, with
some relief.

SUNNY, Gideon's grandson, five years old, has been watching
him from the back window of the house. He leaves the window.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
<b>DOLLY SHOT OF SUNNY
</b>
Sunny peeps in the workroom. Through the crack in the door, a
Woman waves to Sunny. 

<b>INT. WORKROOM - DAY
</b>
The room is nearly filled with pregnant women and their
husbands. SUZIE, Gideon's wife, late 60's or early 70's, a
picture of health, is giving a last bit of instruction before
the class ends. Some of the people are already preparing to
leave.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tRemember, especially you men, that
tworking together now will already
thave formed a bond before the child
tarrives. The woman is very
tsensitive.

Somewhere in the room a Male Voice booms out.

<b>tttVOICE (O.S.) 
</b>tTell me about it.

There is a bit of LAUGHTER as all start putting away their
things.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Gideon looks over at the chickens, scratching around in the
garden. He calls to them, but they don't respond. He puts his
shoes on and walks towards the back door of the house.
Entering the house, he stops and waits inside the door
peeping out. In a sort of devilish manner he talks to
himself.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tSpoiling the little foxes that
tspoil my vines.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY 
</b>
Shot of the backyard. Nothing. Suddenly, with the grace and
suspicion of alley cats, kids jump over Gideon's back fence,
look around timidly, and start climbing up his fruit tree.

Gideon walks down the steps slowly while humming in a deep
voice. He turns the water on and walks over to the tree,
trapping the kids. Dangling legs, hanging from the tree, try
to scurry up the tree to safety. Gideon sprays the tree with
water. Wet kids fall out of the tree and in one motion leap
the fence. Gideon cuts the water off and slaps the dirt off
his hands. He is quite pleased with himself.

<b>EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
</b>
One of the wet kids is watching Gideon as he goes back inside
the house. The boy signals the others who slowly follow in
single file. They jump the fence and climb back up the tree.
They let their half-eaten fruit fall to the ground.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Suzie opens a letter and a picture of a baby falls out. Suzie
looks at the picture before reading the letter.
She tries to find a place for it among the other baby
pictures that cover the entire mirror on the dresser. Gideon
comes in and starts to undress.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tMy mind plays tricks on me. Is it
tokay if I take a bath now?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tEveryone is gone. Rhonda is in the
tbathroom.

RHONDA, Gideon's granddaughter, 13 years old, comes out of
the bathroom.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI was looking through my trunk and
tI can't find my toby.

<b>tttRHONDA 
</b>tWhat's that?

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tIt is a charm that my great
tgrandmother made me.

Everyone notices the worried look on Gideon's face.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tIt will show up.

<b>tttRHONDA 
</b>tIf my daddy calls, tell him I
twalked home.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou be careful and thank you for
tlooking after Sunny.

Sunny is asleep on the sofa with a half-eaten apple ready to
fall out of his hand.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tBabe Brother and his wife are
ttaking advantage of a situation. I
thate to be mean to people but
tpicking Sunny up when they feel
tlike it has to come to an end. Now
tI'm going to ask him how come he
tcouldn't be at your birthday.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tDon't bother the poor boy. It just
ttakes some people a little longer
tto figure out who they are.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI don't know how two brothers can
tbe so different.

<b>EXT. MRS. BAKER'S BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
SKIP BAKER, who is thirteen, crawls out of his pigeon cage,
holding two birds that he throws up in the air. He climbs
upon the garage roof and throws rocks at the birds to keep
them flying. He WHISTLES and YELLS at them.

<b>CLOSE UP OF BIRDS FLYING
</b>
As the birds circle Skip's house, they do backward rolls and
death grips. Skip throws more rocks to keep them flying. The
rocks land on Gideon's roof.

The SOUND of a person trying to learn how to play a TRUMPET
breaks the pleasant SOUNDS of the pigeons popping their wings
and flying in circles over the house.

<b>INT. MRS. BAKER'S HOUSE, RODNEY'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
RODNEY BAKER is about nine. He stands next to a shaded
window, trying to finger the right valves on his trumpet. He
tries to hit a high note, but only succeeds in making an
awful screeching sound.

<b>EXT. MRS. BAKER'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
A group of kids walking by Rodney's window shout insulting
things about his horn playing.

<b>tttKIDS 
</b>tShut up! Go help your mama wash
tdishes!

<b>INT. GIDEON'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Suzie is standing over an egg that just fell on the floor.
The SCREECHING SOUND of the trumpet from next door is
interrupted by the doorbell. Suzie cannot decide on what to
do, to clean the egg up or answer the door. The doorbell
keeps RINGING.

<b>EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY
</b>
Two uniformed Police Officers stand impatiently at the door.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
Suzie invites OFFICER SCOTT and OFFICER DAVIS in. Both men
are white and are in their mid-twenties. Officer Davis does
most of the questioning.

<b>tttDAVIS 
</b>tWe have a complaint from one of
tyour neighbors about a rooster
tcrowing in the mornings.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
Gideon is shaving with a straight razor and humming to
himself, obviously in a good mood. Suzie sticks her head in.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tThe police are here to talk to you
tabout the chickens.

The good mood that Gideon was in dissolves quickly. Gideon
wipes the soap off his face and throws the towel down. Suzie
leaves. Gideon brushes his hair and adjusts his bathrobe.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
Gideon comes in, still adjusting his bathrobe.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWhat can I do for you, Officer?

Suzie returns to the kitchen to clean the egg on the floor.
Officer Scott keeps her in view.

<b>tttDAVIS 
</b>tYou know it is against the city
tordinance to keep chickens or live
tstock.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI always had chickens, ducks and
twhatnots.

<b>tttDAVIS 
</b>tNot anymore, not in the city.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWe grow most of our own food. The
tmoney I get from social security,
tmy pension and my wife's work,
tkeeps us living on the edge. What
tchoice do people like us have.

<b>tttDAVIS 
</b>tWell, you just have to move further
tout.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tNow how far would further out be?

<b>tttDAVIS 
</b>tI'm not here to argue, sir.

<b>tttSCOTT 
</b>tYou guys don't make anything
tillegal, do you?

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tLike what may I ask?

<b>tttSCOTT 
</b>tYou might have a distillery pumping
tout barrels of moonshine.

Suzie looks at Scott for a moment and goes into the kitchen.
Gideon is about to lose control. Davis heads off the
confrontation.

<b>tttDAVIS 
</b>tLook, just get rid of the chickens
tand you all have a nice day.

Gideon stands in the doorway watching the Police go down the
steps.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI'll be damned if I get rid of my
tchickens. I ought to get some hogs
tand put them out there.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
There is soft knocking on the door. Suzie enter frame wearing
a robe.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tWho is it?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER (V.O.) 
</b>tBabe Brother.

Suzie opens the door. BABE BROTHER, Gideon's youngest son,
about 31, handsome, wearing an expensive suit, comes in,
beating the cold off of him and blowing in his hands.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI was hoping you came to the door
tinstead of him. It gets cold at
tnight.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tThis doesn't make any sense; you
tare going to drag that poor boy out
tin the cold air.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tHe will be alright.

The camera follows Babe Brother. He passes Gideon's room
where Gideon is asleep, snoring loudly.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Suzie and Babe Brother enter the bedroom where Sunny is
sleeping. Suzie gives Babe Brother a blanket to wrap Sunny up
in.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tThanks for taking care of him. I
twill try not to be so long next
ttime.

Babe Brother gives his mother a good-night kiss. Gideon comes
to the door.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWhat time is it? Do you think you
tcan just treat us like your slave?
tIt's after one.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI tried to call to let you know I
twas going to be late.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tThat's a lie.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tLet us settle this tomorrow.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tLook! Don't try to get ahead by
triding our backs.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tt(shouts)
tI pay my own way.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tSince when?

He reaches for Babe Brother but Suzie comes between them.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tTake Sunny home, please.

She pushes Babe Brother away. Babe Brother walks away,
staring back at his father.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT
</b>
Gideon is lying in bed. Suzie gets in beside him.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tYour feet are cold.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tGo back to sleep.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI asked you to wake me when Babe
tBrother comes.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou all act like two roosters.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI'm not going to let him get away
twith murder.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou and Babe Brother are so much
talike...

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tHe ain't nothing like me. How come
ta man has to have sons that are day
tand night apart? You ought to stop
tprotecting him.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tHush.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tYou're always taking his side.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tHush.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI'm trying to make him a man but
tyou keep babying him.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou're going to find yourself on
tthe floor.

<b>INT. BABE BROTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
The bedroom is tastefully furnished with modern art and
paintings by Barns.

Babe Brother wakes up with Sunny standing in the doorway
looking at him. It takes Babe Brother some time to fully wake
up.

Finally he sits reluctantly on the side of the bed and Sunny
comes over and sits next to him, trying to get his weary
father interested in his remote-control racing car.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI want you to be the richest man in
tthe world so I can be the richest
tfather in the world.

<b>tttSUNNY 
</b>tI don't want to be rich. I want to
twork on the railroad like
tgrandfather.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tSon, if you are going to have a
tfamily, you can't always choose a
tjob just because you like it. 
tt(beat)
tI don't want you to shine anybody's
tshoes or be a porter. You let
tsomebody else carry your bags.

Sunny quietly gets up and follows his car out of the room.

<b>INT. BABE BROTHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Babe Brother, having showered but still wearing his pajamas,
drags himself to the kitchen table where his wife LINDA has a
huge coffee mug with the inscription, "I'm the boss", waiting
for him.

Linda is about thirty years old and materially oriented like
her husband. She is wearing a conservatively cut business
dress.

Sunny stops playing with his car and gets himself an empty
cup. Babe Brother is about to pour him some of his coffee
when Linda objects.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b><b>tNO.
</b>
Sunny pleads with her in silence but Linda refuses to yield.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tHe wouldn't want any if you didn't
ttry to keep it away from him.

Linda leaves the table but stops for a moment and looks down
at her husband.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tBecause you were spoiled, don't try
tto spoil Sunny.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tMy daddy never gave me anything
twithout my having to sweat for it.
tEvery summer, the way they kept me
tand Junior out of trouble was to
tsend us to Big Daddy's farm. We
twould get up with the chickens.
tEvery summer the fence had to be
trepaired. The barn needed a coat of
tpaint. We had to pip all of Big
tMama's hundred laying hens and go
tto church all day on Sunday. For
tBig Daddy, calluses and sweat were
tthe mark of a man. Sunny will never
thave to bust his knuckles like we
tdid.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tI want Sunny to have an advantage
tthat you and I never had, but he
tneeds discipline, and you are not
thelping when I tell him to do
tsomething and you allow him to get
tout of it.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tWhat is a sip of coffee going to
tdo?

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tCoffee is bad for anybody,
tespecially for a child.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI don't see you crying about my
tdrinking it.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tHow old are you?

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
<b>A SLOW CLOSE UP DOLLY SHOT OF SUZIE'S HANDS DROPPING SEEDS IN
</b><b>THE GROUND.
</b>
Gideon is raking out the chicken coop. He puts the rake down
and walks over to the garden and watches Suzie plant seeds
for a while.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tInstead of standing here doing
tnothing, I better give those
tchickens some scratch before they
tstart cackling.

<b>EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
</b>
OLD JOHN is pushing his cart up the alley. Old John's face is
washed so clean that it shines. His pants are dirty and his
cart is full of odds and ends of no value. He looks to be
about seventy and fit. Old John throws a sack on Gideon's
fence.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Suzie,is bent over a plant that she is tying to a stick. She
looks up and sees the sack on the fence. A smile appears on
her face. She goes over to the fence.

<b>EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
</b>
Old John is about to take up his journey when Suzie sticks
her head over the fence.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tHow are you?

<b>tttOLD JOHN 
</b>tTolerably well. I brought you some
tmore rabbit manure for your roses.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tIt is so considerate of you.

Gideon sticks his head over the fence.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWell, well, look who is taking up
tall the sunshine. Brother John, how
tare you doing?

<b>tttOLD JOHN 
</b>tI'm still here.

Suzie leaves the two men talking.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tTell me something. How do you get
tenergy to stay on the move all day?

<b>tttOLD JOHN 
</b>tYou couldn't sit on your rump under
tmy daddy's roof. No sir. If you
tcouldn't outwork his mule, you
twasn't worth the salt you put in
tgreens. You had to wake up looking
tfor something to do. I was raised
tas a mule and now I'm a rolling
tstone.

Suzie sticks her head over the fence and hands a bag of red
tomatoes to Old John.

<b>tttOLD JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>tI didn't mean for you to pay me for
tthat.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI know you didn't but you have been
tso thoughtful.

<b>tttOLD JOHN 
</b>tBut when your sunflowers come up,
tI'll pay you for them.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI planted a row just for you and
tyou don't owe me anything.

<b>EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</b>
<b>HIGH ANGLE SHOTS
</b>
off in the distance, a man is cutting his lawn. Gideon and
Suzie are working in their garden. Other couples working
their gardens. Two young men are working on their car, which
is creating a lot of smoke. A group of girls are sitting on a
porch trying to sing while one of the smaller ones is trying
to learn a step.

Skip is on the roof with his radio listening to rap music
while his birds circle over head. From time to time he throws
a rock at them.

<b>INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>THE CAMERA IS OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM. THE SCENE IS SHOT THROUGH
</b><b>THE PARTLY OPEN DOOR.
</b>
It is hard to see the woman giving birth. There are people
blocking the view of the camera. Suzie is facing the camera
and the woman has her back to the camera.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tIt hurts.

<b>tttSUZIE
</b>tDon't push too fast! Breathe! The
thard part is over. You can see the
ttop of the head.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tIt hurts. The pain. 
tt(scream)
tIt's tearing me.

<b>tttSUZIE
</b>tFather, give her a hand.

<b>tttFATHER
</b>tHey, this is too much.

<b>tttSUZIE
</b>tYou do your part.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tCan you tell what it is?

<b>tttSUZIE
</b>tAlmost there.

<b>tttFATHER
</b>tIt's a junior.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tAh, I wanted a girl.

Suddenly the baby begins to SCREAM.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
A sack appears on Gideon's fence. The sound of Old John's
cart is heard rattling off.

<b>INT. CHURCH - DAY
</b>
Suzie, Gideon, JUNIOR (Gideon's elder son, 35 years old and
dark skinned), PAT (Junior's wife, who is expecting, about
32) and Rhonda are all seated next to one another in the same
row. The PREACHER is knee-deep in water. He is baptizing a
group of young people. The members of the church are singing
"Take Me To The Water". An Elderly Man who can hardly walk
without help is being led down to the pool.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Suzie, Gideon, Junior, Pat and Rhonda are all seated at the
table eating. Babe Brother is standing up. He looks in the
pot but doesn't find it to his liking. Junior is irritated at
his brother.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tWhen are you going to find time to
thelp me fix the roof?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tYou all don't believe me when I
ttell you I'm afraid of heights.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tYou used that excuse to get out of
tthe army.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tYou always got something to say.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tYour mother asked me not to mention
tit but your mother's birthday was
tlast week.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI hadn't forgotten. I ordered some
tcloth but it didn't come in and I
tfelt so bad if I would have come to
ther birthday without that, I just
tstayed at home.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWhat did your wife get her?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tWe got the same thing.

Junior laughs at Babe Brother's story.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tBoy, go tell your wife to come in.

<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
Babe Brother's car, a new Audi, is parked out front.

Linda is in the front seat reading a magazine while Sunny is
asleep in the back seat. Babe Brother sticks his head in the
window.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER
</b>tWhy don't you come in for a while?

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tI would like to finish reading
tthis. What would I talk about? I
thaven't read this month's almanac.
tI don't care to hear about how the
tcorn was this fall or how to get
trid of gophers by putting garlic in
ttheir holes. They pride themselves
tin making life hard and that's not
tmy cup of tea.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Suzie, Gideon, Junior, Pat and Rhonda are still at the table
eating.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou know, Babe Brother's wife just
tdumps greens in the pot without
twashing them.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tBabe Brother is a poor boy.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tYou all should have been hard on
thim like you were me and he
twouldn't be the way he is.

<b>tttSUZIE

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tJunior, you are wrong.

<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tJust for a minute.

A dirt rock HITS the front windshield. Linda lets out a
little scream. Babe Brother looks around. Skip is on top of
the roof next door.

<b>tttSKIP 
</b>tI didn't mean to hit your car. I
twas throwing at my birds.

<b>INT. FEED STORE - DAY
</b>
Gideon is looking at the price of laying mash. He digs his
hand into a barrel of scratch. Sunny also digs his hand in
the barrel.

Suzie is looking at new young plants. She gives the
vegetables a thorough going-over.

Gideon is standing in line waiting to place his order.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI need about five pounds of laying
tmash and you better give me about
tthe same of scratch.

While at the counter, Gideon turns and looks around at the
prices of different items. Suzie brings her plants and puts
them on the counter.

<b>tttGIDEON (CONT'D)
</b>tWhen are you going to have a sale
ton weed killer?

<b>tttCASHIER 
</b>tYou missed it. We had a two-day
tsale last week.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWhat kind of a sale is a two-day
tsale? I thought sales last a week
tor two.

<b>tttCASHIER 
</b>tEvery day we have something
tdifferent. Today's sale is hay. 25%
toff. If you have a horse or cow,
tyou're in business.

<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Sunny looks at the Little Girl in the next car; she has her
mouth pressed against the window. She is missing a tooth.
Gideon is behind the wheel while Suzie holds her new plants
up to the sun, carefully looking at them.

Sunny, seated in the back, pokes a hole in the sack of feed.
The mash trickles to the floor as if from an hour glass.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Suzie is sitting in front of a table full of jars. Each jar
has a shoot and is half-filled with water. Gideon is on his
knees trying to fix the hinge to a cabinet. Sunny is sitting
almost under him listening to him tell stories. Sunny has a
coffee can full of marbles.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tAll of the preachers were down in
tthe basement of the church
tconfessing their sins to one
tanother. They were way down in the
tbasement 'cause they figured no one
twould hear them. One of the
tpreachers said, it makes me feel
ttoo shame to tell how bad I have
tbeen. You know them young gals that
tsit up in the first row. I can look
tat them and forget my text. I'm
tjust lost when it comes to women,
teven them middle age sisters. Then
tanother preacher said, I don't
tthink I can tell you what my sin is
t'cause it's bad. Another preacher
tsaid, Brother, we all amongst
tfriends. Tell us what's troubling
tyour soul. Clear your conscience.

Gideon takes a sip of water.

<b>tttGIDEON (CONT'D)
</b>tSo the preacher said, we all got a
tbond 'cause we confessed to one
tanother. So let me tell you, my sin
tis corn liquor. I just acts a fool
tbehind that spirit water. I loves
tit more than preaching. Now ain't
tthat a sin, lord. So all the
tpreachers went on confessing, each
tone worst than the last. Finally
tthey came to the last preacher who
thad been very quiet and listening
tto every word that fell. One of the
tpreachers said to him, it's your
tturn. Confessing will lift you
tburden, Brother. Bare us your soul.
tWe did. The last preacher said, no,
tmy sin is the worst among all of
tyou. One of the preachers said, ah
tgo on man and stop all this
tsuspense. So the last preacher
tsaid, like I told you my sin is the
tlowest. 
tt(beat)
tMy sin is gossiping and I can't
twait to get out and tell what I
theard.

Sunny does not get the humor of the story. He is more
interested in picking up his marbles that Gideon's foot
kicked over.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou oughtn't tell him stories like
tthat.

<b>tttSUNNY 
</b>tTell me another story.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI'll you a story about the terrapin
tand the rabbit. No, you tell me a
tstory. Come on.

<b>tttSUNNY 
</b>tOnce upon a time, my mommy and
tdaddy lived in this big house that
tI bought for them. I got them this
tbig car.

A strong wind causes the broom handle to knock against the
china teapot, KNOCKING IT TO THE FLOOR. Suzie stops Sunny
from trying to help pick up the pieces.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou stay back. You might cut your
tfingers.

Suzie looks down sadly at her broken tea pot.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI looked everywhere for my toby.

<b>EXT. APPLE ORCHARD - DAY
</b>
The trees are barren, which gives them an unfriendly look. As
we LOOK at the ground, a man's distorted shadow stops in the
frame.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY
</b>
A shadow of a man appears on Gideon's porch. The camera tilts
up to HARRY MENTION, a very dark-looking, ageless old man
carrying several boxes held together by a cord. He looks
exhausted from his journey. He looks in his address book and,
satisfied that he reached the right house, he rings the
doorbell.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
Suzie comes to the front door; she recognizes Harry right
away. She invites him in. Harry stumps his feet on the porch
several times and then enters.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tHarry, I can't believe it is you.
tGideon, look who is here.

Gideon comes in, wiping his hands. Sunny, carrying the broom,
follows behind.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tHarry, good God Almighty, man! It's
tbeen, what, thirty years or more.
tSuzie, we haven't seen Harry since
twe left home.

Harry is more interested in the boy, but Sunny doesn't want
to come near Harry. It is Gideon's arm that is keeping him
within close range of Harry.

<b>tttGIDEON (CONT'D)
</b>tThis is my grandson, Sunny. He is
tmy youngest son's child.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tHe kind of favors one of my boys
twhen he was about his age.

Sunny, playing with the broom, accidentally touches Harry's
shoe with it. Harry hides his anger about being touched with
the broom. Harry takes the broom from Sunny and spits on the
bottom of it.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tBoy, that is bad luck to touch a
tfellow with a broom.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tHe knows better. Sunny, apologize
tto Harry.

<b>tttSUNNY 
</b>tI'm sorry.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWhat are you doing in these parts?

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tI came all the way from Detroit by
tbus going to Oakland. The bus
tstopped in Los Angeles. I had to
tget off and take a rest. I'll catch
tthe last bus leaving at midnight.
tI'm just too tired to go on.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWhy didn't you catch a plane?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tMy feet have never been on anything
tthat wasn't directly attached to
tthe ground.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tStay until you feel better? I would
tlike to hear all the news.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI'm worn out but won't you feel
tlike you are taking in a stranger?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tStranger my foot, it was my
tgrandmother who helped you into
tthis world.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWell, I don't want to put you out.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tMan, put your boxes down and stay
tas long as you like. We have empty
trooms since the boys got their own
tfamilies and moved out.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWell if you're sure, I won't be a
tbother. Oh, I don't sleep on no
tspring mattress. I always make
tmyself a pallet on the floor.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
The bedroom door to Harry's room is cracked open. Peering
through the cracked door, we SEE Harry asleep on his pallet.
His back is turned to the camera. It is dead silent. There
does not seem to be any sign of life. On the floor is a plate
that has water in it. It looks like it is for a dog.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Suzie is peeling potatoes and Gideon is ironing.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tPoor old Harry, he really must have
tbeen worn out. He has been asleep
tall day.

Without anyone being aware, Harry has been standing in the
doorway for some time.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tGood evening. It must be all the
tdifferent time zones I crossed that
tmakes me feel this weary.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou should go back and rest.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tNo, if I rest any longer, I won't
tsleep tonight. May I use your
tbathroom to wash up a bit?

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tMan, act like this is your home.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tThat's awful generous of you. I
talways ask to keep from wearing out
twelcome.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tOne can tell you are from back
thome. These people nowadays don't
tknow what manners are.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWhere we come from, you had to know
thow to act right. You had to know
thow to say yes sir and no sir. You
thad to know your place.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tYou had to tread softly.

The doorbell rings and Gideon goes to answer it.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tThose days you could always find
tsomething redeeming about even the
tworst person.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tYou remember that boy who lost his
tmind, Joe? You could hear him
tpitching horseshoes at night in the
tdark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make
thim mad and call yourself running
tin the house to be safe. He would
tpick up a brick and say "go on in
tthere brick and hit somebody" and
tit would find its mark.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom
tbecause of him.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tAll those places that us coloreds
tlived, that we used to call
tBottoms, have all been changed to
tDrives and Heights. Everything is
tin what you call it, not in what it
tis.

Gideon comes back with Junior, Pal and Rhonda.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tHarry, I would like for you to meet
tmy oldest son, his wife and
tdaughter.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tPleased to meet you. So you're from
tback home, too.

Harry and Junior shake hands, but Rhonda gives Harry only a
nod of her head and a smile.

Pat, who is pregnant, attempts to shake hands with Harry, but
is forced to withdraw her hand because of a sudden pain in
her stomach.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tThis boy must be turning over. Oh,
the just kicked me again.

Junior feels her stomach. Pat again tries to shake Harry's
hand and again gets a jolt from her stomach. She finds a
chair to sit down in.

The SOUND of rocks hitting the roof causes everyone to look
up.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tIt's the boy next door throwing at
this birds. I'm just waiting on him
tto hit a pane in the window

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI'm going to wash up now. You all
tplease excuse me.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
Harry is wiping off his face with a washcloth. He stares at
himself in the mirror for a long time. The sudden sound of
the boy next door starting to play his trumpet startles him.
He smiles at the trumpeter's efforts.

He wrings the wash cloth out. A reddish oil-like liquid DRIPS
into the face bowl.

<b>EXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
A few of the houses have lights on. Suddenly, Gideon's
rooster starts to CROW. A dog starts to bark and a garbage
can is knocked over. Bedroom lights in almost all the houses
in the neighborhood pop on. The voices of neighbors
complaining are heard.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Harry is just waking up. He listens to the voices of Suzie
and Gideon as they get ready for church.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Gideon is paging through the Bible as he stands by the door,
waiting for Suzie who is watering her plants. Harry comes in.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tGood morning.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tYou ought to come hear our
tpreacher. Remember old Cat Iron?
tWell, our preacher is just as
tstrong.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tNext time when I feel a little
tbetter perhaps.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI was going to get up and get a hen
tout there for dinner, but time got
taway.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tOh, I would feel much at home if
tyou let me get one for you. I
thaven't wrung a chicken's neck in a
tmonth of Sundays. You know, folks
twould call my daddy to kill their
thogs. That used to be my trade from
ttime to time.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWell, I would appreciate that.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Gideon and Suzie are stepping off the porch. Harry is
standing behind the screen door.

Gideon and Suzie get in Junior's car. Junior, Pat and Rhonda
wave to Harry as the car pulls away.

<b>INT. LIVING HOUSE - DAY
</b>
<b>IT IS A TRACKING SHOT, FOLLOWING HARRY THROUGH THE HOUSE.
</b>
Harry looks through Gideon's and Suzie's private things. He
looks at the baby pictures that fill the mirror. He reads
Suzie's letters that are dated years ago. In one of the
letters, he finds a picture of a man standing behind a
plough. "Uncle Joe after Ella's death" is written on the
back. A picture of a mule holds his interest. He looks at it
for a long time and carries it with him as he continues his
search.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Harry slowly walks along the rows in Suzie's garden. He
stands by the chicken cage. Suddenly, the chickens start to
run about and CACKLE as if a dog had gotten in.

Harry turns from the chicken coop. He stands still. Sunny is
hiding behind a bush.

Sunny steps around the bush. Harry looks at Sunny with such
concentration that Sunny takes a step backward as if getting
ready to defend himself.

MRS. BAKER, a black woman in her early thirties, comes out on
the back porch. She shakes out a rug. She stops shaking the
rug and stares at Harry.

Harry becomes aware of Mrs. Baker's stare. He comes to
himself and smiles at her.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Harry and Babe Brother are playing cards while Linda watches
and Sunny plays by himself on the floor. In the sink is a
newspaper full of bloody feathers. A small flame is under a
pot on the stove. Harry looks at the chicken in the pot and
sits back down.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tYou don't act like the rest of
tGideon's friends. They believe if
tyou are not hard at work, you are
thard at sin.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tOh, I'm more modern in my ways. I
tdon't believe in sin, though there
tis good and evil. 
tt(beat)
tAnd evil is a thing you work at.

Harry takes his knife, a crab apple switch, out. It has a
rabbit foot attached to it. Harry cleans his fingernail with
the knife. Sunny is interested in the rabbit foot. He reaches
for the knife.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tNot you mustn't touch. Your mama
tmight not like you handling knives.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tI think he wants to see your rabbit
tfoot.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI let this rabbit foot do in place
tof my toby that I lost years ago.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tWhat's a toby?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tYou don't want to be at crossroads
twithout one. It's a charm that old
tpeople teach you how to make. I had
tone for a long time that belonged
tto my grandmother who had it ever
tsince she was a child. 
tt(beat)
tIn my travels I misplaced it. I
thave been looking over my shoulder
tever since.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tI thought you weren't old
tfashioned.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tIn some things. When we were
tchildren, there used to be an old
tman that came around and would
tsnatch your soul if you didn't have
tsomething on you that didn't make a
<b>tX.
</b>
Harry is aware that Babe Brother is interested in the knife.
After cleaning his last fingernail, he hands the knife to
Babe Brother.

Harry looks at the cards in his hand. He smiles to himself.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tDid you have your child at home?

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tNo. No. No. No. I had my Child at
tCedars and Sinai. And that ain't no
tcounty hospital. You have to have
tcash or check before you come in
tthe door.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tSome folks take that natural stuff
ttoo far.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tJunior's wife kept her afterbirth'
tin the refrigerator. That's why I
tdo not eat over there now.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tCountry people got so many strange
tways,

Harry looks again at the chicken that he is boiling.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tDid you ever have to use this
tthing?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tThat is called a crab apple switch.
tIt's for those bad acting monkeys
tand just the thing for a mean dog.
tNow I don't know if I actually did
twhat I did or got my life and story
tmixed in with other folk's stories
tbut I seem to recall that I had to
tuse my crab apple on a boy from
tback home. I was up in Memphis
tworking on the railroad, like your
tdaddy who had an easy job. He would
tsing a song that had a cadence and
twe would lay track. Anyway I was
tcoming down Beale Street and I
theard this music coming from a
tsaloon. Sure enough it was Emory.
tMy daddy taught both of us to play
tbut Emory was natural at it. Got in
ta blues band and what not. He and
tanother boy had killed a boy named
tHocker sometime back and they
tballed the Jack leaving town. Emory
thad lost one eye and had a scar
trunning down his face. Bad luck I
twould say. He got to drinking that
tcorn liquor. We went to his girl's
troom and he wouldn't stop drinking.
tHe started talking about the old
tdays and he went mad. He pulled his
tknife and I got to mine first. The
tlights went out.

Linda picks up a card and looks at it. There is a naked woman
on the back.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER
</b>tDon't pick up the cards if you are
tnot in the game. Did he die?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI don't know what happened to him.
tHe just ran out into the streets. 
tt(beat)
tI got some old records I want you
tto hear. I like the blues sung
tsimply, man and a guitar. Or sung
tby a woman who had bad luck all her
tlife. Don't ever let anyone tell
tyou his life's story if it is of a
tweary life full of sadness. When I
twas a boy, a man told me a story of
thow he lost all of his sons and
tI'll be damned if the same thing
tdidn't happen to me.

Sunny is busy playing in the curtains.

The SOUND of Gideon and Suzie arriving makes them scurry to
get the cards put away. Harry puts his knife away just as
Suzie and Gideon enter. Linda feels a little embarrassed.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tHow was church?

Gideon and Suzie are surprised to see Linda. They don't know
what to say.

<b>EXT. MRS. BAKER'S BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Rodney walks around in the yard BLOWING his trumpet as loud
as he can. The SOUND of the trumpet frightens Skip's birds.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
Gideon is repairing the pipes under the face bowl. Harry is
leaning against the door.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tHow often is your wife called to
thelp delivery?

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tIt was slow. Now it seems like
teveryone is having births at home.

Gideon takes the pipe off. It has rotted. Gideon cannot
believe it.

<b>tttGIDEON (CONT'D)
</b>tWhat could have caused this? I just
tchanged this damn thing.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tEverything these days is made
toverseas.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tYou and Babe Brother hit it off so
twell.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tCourse, it is your business, but I
tfeel obliged to tell you that maybe
tyou have not been fair with the
tboy.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI tried to teach him right from
twrong just like I did his Junior.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tEveryone has to follow his own
tplough. A man doesn't have to know
thow to cut a wick and clean a
tchimney nowadays. City people don't
tgive a hoot and a holler about the
tshape of the moon nowadays. You
tdon't plant old ways...
tt(beat)
t... but, at the end, you find
tyourself doing what your father did
tbut you have to have the land in
tyou.
tt(beat)
tIt's when you want to give the
thouse or farm to the kids and they
tdon't want it. You sell it to a
tstranger. You worked your whole
tlife, for what?
tt(beat)
tI doubt if people nowadays have
tknowledge of a victory garden or
tseen an inch worm. All what we've
texperienced has no meaning.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tYou're suppose to teach your
tchildren what you know. Junior, I
tdon't have to worry about. Babe
tBrother is a different story.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tYou still call him boy. You call
tBabe Brother boy in front of his
twife and son.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tMy daddy called me boy up to the
ttime he died. I was always boy to
thim.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>t'Course, you could be right. Your
tsons are alive. All my sons are
tdead.

Off-screen, Rodney starts to practice on his HORN.

<b>INT. BABE BROTHER'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
Babe Brother is sitting with Sunny by the screen door blowing
giant bubbles. The bubbles drift past Linda, who is sitting
at the table with real estate papers all over the table. She
is talking on the phone with a client and signals them to
stop disturbing her.

Babe Brother sends more bubbles floating by, causing her to
shake the water off her papers while she talks to a first
time buyer.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tIt has three bedrooms, one and a
thalf baths. Well, yes, that means
ttwo toilets and one bath. Well...
tYes, by appointment... Call me back
tif you decide.

She hangs up the phone.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tYou would think people never lived
tin a house if they have to ask what
tdoes 1 1/2 baths mean.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tWill you still get the money from
tyour father?

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tI told him we might not need it, if
tyou can talk your parents into
tgiving you your share of the
tproperty.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tPops put Big Daddy's farm in
tRhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed
tit so no one can borrow on it.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tWe could borrow on that land and
tput the money to work.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI preached to Mom and Dad about it
tbut they are stuck in their ways,
tit's like talking to a brick. But
tif there is a way...

Babe Brother is lost in his thoughts. He stares down at his
hands resting on his knees. He picks up the telephone.

<b>INT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Junior is on the phone with Babe Brother. Pat crosses in
front of the camera shaking her head in a negative manner.
Babe Brother's voice is just audible.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tYou want me to mortgage my house to
tinvest in a scheme of yours? You
tknow the last time we went into
tsomething together Daddy had to go
tin his savings to keep us from

<b>tttBABE BROTHER (O.S.) 
</b>tWhy are you always afraid to get
tsomewhere?

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tThis is not a good time to take
tchances. Your best friend, Robert,
tan accountant, lost his home and is

ttime to time. He comes down to
tchurch for a free meal.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER (O.S.) 
</b>tThis is what it is all about,

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tRobert asks about you. When are you
tgoing to do something to help him?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER (O.S.) 
</b>tMaybe I can get down there next

Junior turns to his wife, who is off-camera.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tBabe Brother always acts like a
tgambler who is in the biggest game
tof his life and don't know about
tplaying cards.

<b>EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON
</b>
Harry and Gideon are walking along a railroad track. The sun
is blinding. The heat makes the asphalt Appear to turn into a
lake off in the distance. Gideon appears exhausted; beads of
sweat continually form on his forehead. He fans himself with
his hat. Harry is unaffected by the hot temperature.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI can sit here and look at train
ttracks all day. We laid enough of
tthem, didn't we? So many memories
tare stretched along tracks like
tthese.

Gideon looks down the tracks. A bowl of dust stirs off in the
distance. The hot temperature makes the tracks appear liquid.

<b>EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON (EFFECT)
</b>
The tracks begin to twist and bend. Off in the distance,
faint images of men laying track to a song.

<b>EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON
</b>
Gideon is standing with his hat in his hand. His posture is
that of an extremely old man.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tIn weather like this, you cannot
twalk around bare-headed.

He wipes the sweat from his hat band.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWe'll go a little farther. The walk
twill do us some good.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Suzie is peeling apples while Sunny, standing next to her,
catches peelings in his mouth. Pat is sitting next to the
window. She is uncomfortable. She loosens her pants, giving
her stomach more room. Rhonda is leaning over the back of the
chair with her arms around Pat's neck. They are in
silhouette.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tDid you do your homework?

<b>tttRHONDA 
</b>tYes.

tMama?

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tWhat?

<b>tttRHONDA 
</b>tCan I name the baby?

<b>INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Suzie knocks on the door. Harry comes to the door still
buttoning his shirt.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI have someone I want you to meet.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI'll be right there.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
Gideon in the background in the kitchen washing off the
vegetables. Suzie and HATTIE are sitting at the table. Harry
comes in and is surprised to see Hat tie. Hattie is in her
late sixties but looks well. She makes a conscious effort to
dress plainly.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tI couldn't believe it when Suzie
tcalled and said you were staying
there. How have you been?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tGirl, do you still sing and dance?

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tNo, I'm a different person now,
tHarry.

Hattie has a nervous condition that causes her to squint from
time to time. Gideon comes in from the kitchen.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tHaven't the years been good to
tHattie?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tIt hasn't been the years; it's been
tthe men in her life.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tHarry, that's not nice. I'm in
tchurch now.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWhy run out and close the barn door
twhen the horse is gone? I remember
twhen you weren't saved. That was
tway back yonder when the Natchez

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tSome people grow up and change

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI know your mother ain't still

<b>EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY
</b>
M.C. slams the door to his car and hurries up the steps,
leaving HERMAN, in spite of his bad condition, to get out of
the car the best he can. The car door almost knocks poor
Herman over. M.C. seems rather youthful because of his energy
and awkwardness. He is a large muscular man.

Herman is a dried-up man with nothing, not even a shadow. He
has a racking COUGH.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
M.C. gives Gideon a bear hug, lifting him off his feet. On
seeing Suzie, he drops Gideon and rushes over to lift her up
off her feet.

<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
Herman is still trying to get out of the car.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
M.C. lifts Suzie off the ground twice. He runs over to Hattie
who does not want to be handled, tries to withdraw but M.C.
forces her to her feet and gives a big bear hug. Hattie has a
series of squinting attacks. M.C. squints in return.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tM.C., you still ain't house broken.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tGood God Almighty, if it ain't like

<b>tttHATTIE
</b>tHarry, what did you do, rob the
tgraveyard?

Herman hobbles in and, after a minute of COUGHING, a smile
forms on his face.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Suzie, Gideon and Hattie are seated at the table while M.C.
bounces from one end of the table to the other. One moment he
is on his knees and next moment he is leaning over someone to
flick his ashes in the ashtray on the table. Hattie hates it
when he comes near her.

Harry and Herman sit together in the corner chewing on
starch.

<b>tttM.C. 
</b>tHattie, do you still dance?

<b>tttHATTIE
</b>tI'm in church.

<b>tttM.C.
</b>tWhat does that got to do with it?

<b>tttHATTIE
</b>tSuzie, you still have Joe's number?

<b>tttSUZIE
</b>tI will have to look for it.

<b>tttM.C.
</b>tWho's Joe?

<b>tttHATTIE
</b>tNone of your business.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tThat is a boy from home, Lulla's
tbrother.

Suzie is surprised.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tHarry, you know everything.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tYou got to know everything, do
teverything, and be everything.

Gideon brings a fresh pot of coffee. Gideon tries to signal
M.C. to stop harassing Hattie. M.C. leans over Hattie again
to use the ashtray.

Harry is helping Herman to his feet. Herman starts to cough.
They come over and join the rest of the crowd at the table.
Harry seats Herman next to Gideon and pours Herman a cup of
coffee. He puts the sugar and cream in the coffee for Herman.
Suzie comes back with Joe's number and hands it to Hattie.

<b>tttHERMAN 
</b>tM.C., I'm worn out. You ready to
tgo?

<b>tttM.C. 
</b>tIf you are tired, go sit in the

<b>tttHERMAN 
</b>tSuzie, do you have any Swamp Root?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tNo, but I might have some Indian
tChief Tonic.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tI haven't heard anyone mention
tSwamp Root since button-up shoes

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tYou can certainly tell how old you

Hattie is angered.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tYou know the saying, "your heart is
tin your left hand."

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tNow I was trying to be nice, to
tmake conversation, since we go back
tsome.

<b>tttHATTIE
</b>tI was quoting from the Bible. If
tthe shoe fits, wear it.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>t"Out of weariness, I spoke to my

<b>tttM.C. 
</b>tYou ain't going to win playing the

<b>tttHERMAN 
</b>tYou all ought to get along.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tHarry, you know you remind me of so
tmuch that went wrong in my life.
tWhen I heard you were here, I made

tyou. I see you are still a pile of

<b>tttHERMAN 
</b>tOh Lord.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tMy sister, women can get away with
tso much. I don't have any enemies
t'cause I don't live in the past. As

t"In the hope of glory and good, I

</b>tHarry has got your number.

</b>tAn empty wagon makes a lot of noise

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tSpeaking of tappy heads, we ought

</b>tI don't have too many fish fries

</b>tIs this your house?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tOh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWell, it's up to Suzie.

<b>tttSUZIE

</b>tPlease, M.C., take me home.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
The children of the women in Suzie's natural birth group are
huddled together SINGING "Ashiine Ca Chew". The voices of the
women in the next room are audible. The kids go outside to
sit on the porch.

<b>INT. HOUSE, WORK ROOM - DAY
</b>
Most of the women have their newborns with them and are
engaging in talk about how their other children had to adjust
and etc.

A young white mother, REBECCA WILSON, with both her children,
a four year old and one just a few months old, talks with a
deep southern accent.

<b>tttWILSON 
</b>tNo one in my family ever been to a
thospital to give birth. My sister
thas four children and all were born
tat home. My mother and her mother,
tit just goes on and on.

<b>EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY
</b>
A mother leaves with her baby wrapped in a blanket. The kids
surround her, wanting to see the baby.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Pat is looking at a book of baby names. Harry passes the door
and stops.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tA woman in family way just reminds
tof spring and my younger days.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tThat's nice.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWell, you and your husband are
tspecial. Ya, Gideon tells me you do
tvolunteer work to help feed the
tpoor.

Pat beams with joy because Harry recognizes the important
work she is doing.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tHow many people do you all feed?

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tLast Saturday we handed out over
ttwo hundred meals.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tGood God Almighty, bless your
tbones.
tt(pause)
tBut the problem grows.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tWeek by week the crowds at the door
tkeeps getting larger. We can't feed
tall the hungry.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tOf course not. Have you ever heard
tof a man jumping in the river to
tsave five hundred drowning people?
tNo you ain't.
tt(pause)
tYou have to take just one and
tfatten him up. When you spread help
ttoo thin, you , you just nickel and
tdime the situation. If you try to
tsave all, all die but if you save
tone life, life goes on. You just
thave to remember, medicine that
tworks leaves a bitter taste.

Harry looks at the baby picture pasted over the mirror. He
takes the picture of his children from his old black dusty
wallet and compares the faces of his kids with those on the
mirror. He talks to himself more than to Pat.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tYou just take one; you thaw out the
tcold and hunger in his bones from
tsleeping on the bare ground.

Pat watches him and loses herself in what he is doing. She
responds automatically

<b>tttPAT
</b>tI don't know if we could take one
tin with Rhonda and me at home alone
tat times.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tOh, I wasn't pointing my finger at

<b>EXT. GIDEON'S BACK PORCH - DAY
</b>
Junior is taking the back door off to paint. Harry helps him
carry the door and lay it on a saw horse.

<b>tttJUNIOR
</b>tI appreciate you lending me a hand.
tThat lazy ass brother of mine was
tsuppose to help me.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tWell some folks are still waiting
tfor their comeuppance. Don't take

tby how you act. You're a caring
tperson.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tHe should be caring. That is not
ttoo much to ask.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tYa, but you can't do the shuffle
twith one leg. You and your wife, in
tyour spare time, work with the less
tfortunate. Now I'm not talking
tabout you and what you do but some
tfolks that always run to help the
tvictim, deep down are attracted to
tpain and suffering and love to be
tnear the dying.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tAll the people working with us are
treally doing it 'cause they hate to
tsee suffering.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tYou never know what's in the heart
tand just because you can cry
tdoesn't make you human.

<b>INT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Rhonda is in the background washing dishes. Pat and Junior
are sitting at the dining room table, arguing.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tWe can't really bring another
tfamily in here with us.

<b>tttPAT
</b>tWhy not? Harry says that's the only
tway to do good.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tWhen did you talk to Harry?

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tDon't shout!

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Gideon and Sunny are in the garden digging for worms. The
chickens

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI think we have enough. So now tell
tme a story.

<b>EXT. BALDWIN HILLS LAKE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
Gideon is sitting on a rock by the lake. His image is
reflected in the lake. He is asleep. Sunny is putting new
bait on one of the reels and with a whip of the pole, he
casts to the center of the lake. He leans against a tree.
Sunny looks at his sleeping grandfather. Gideon has his pant
legs rolled up. His socks have lost their elastic. His head
is resting on his chest.

Sunny goes near the water.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tBe careful of the water.

Sunny looks back at his grandfather, who appears to be
asleep.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
There is one fish in the bucket.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. LAKE - SUNSET
</b>
<b>WIDE ANGLE SHOT FROM HIGH ANGLE
</b>
Gideon and Sunny are sitting next to each other. The lake
reflects the sky: a deep red. The eerie sound of a long train
whistle breaks the silence.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Harry, Babe Brother and Linda come in after staying out all
night. Linda looks as though she is about to fall asleep
standing up. She awakes and looks at Harry. There is dislike
in her stare. Suzie and Gideon notice Linda fading away.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tAre you feeling well?

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tI've never been so tired in my
tlife. Where is Sunny?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tHe is getting his things together.
tBabe Brother, you ought to take
tyour wife home so she can get some
trest.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tIn a minute.

Sunny comes in carrying his night-clothes folded neatly. He
stands next to Linda. Harry, in a mild but demanding way,
ushers Babe Brother out of the door.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tTake your wife and child home, boy.

Babe Brother seems all too happy to obey Harry. After Harry
closes the door behind Babe Brother, he turns with a wide
smile.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tI got a surprise for you tonight.

Harry flops down on the couch and kicks his shoes off.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tThis old buffalo has been in the
tsun too long.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Suzie and Gideon are getting the food ready while Harry,
wearing a shirt that looks like it is made of shiny
snakeskin, sits in a darkened corner of the room, cutting his
fingernails with his knife.

The door bell rings and Harry slowly walks over to answer the
door. Suzie puts the punch bowl down and hurries over to meet
the first guests, FRED JENKINS, an elderly black man whom she
hasn't seen in years, and Esme Jenkins, his wife.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tFred Jenkins.

<b>tttJENKINS 
</b>tSuzie, you haven't changed and you,
tGideon, if you don't look like John
tHenry. Oh, this is my wife, Esme.
tMy first wife Lulie died.

More people arrive, bottle-necking the doorway. Gideon helps
the Jenkinses to a chair. Hattie comes with her brother
MARSH, who is not too pleased to see Harry. OKRA TATE, an
elderly black man with dark circles under his eyes, comes in
limping badly with an old Polaroid camera hanging from his
neck.

Babe Brother, Linda, Junior, Pat and Rhonda, who is holding
Sunny's hand, all come in together. M.C. drags Herman through
the door coughing. FLIM ANDERSON and his son DOUG are
followed by the twins, WILLIAM and LOVIRAY NORWOOD, who are
in their late 70's.

Babe Brother leaves Linda standing by herself to be next to
Harry.

Zenia Dent, an elderly white woman with a strong Southern
accent, arrives with her husband, Howard Dent, a black man,
who is in a wheelchair. The Twins and Howard are the center
of attention.

Okra comes over and whispers into Harry's ear. Okra leaves
through the front door. Okra comes back in with a bag. Harry,
Babe Brother, M.C. and Herman follow Okra to the kitchen.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Okra sets the bag on the table and steps back to allow Harry
to unveil the bottle of corn liquor.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER
</b>tWhat is that?

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tBoy, that is the real South. That
tis real corn liquor.

A crowd starts to gather around.

<b>tttFLIM
</b>tWhat is in the bottle?

<b>tttM.C.
</b>tIt ain't Geritol.

M.C. starts to hand out tea cups while Harry pours everyone a
drink.

<b>tttHERMAN
</b>tThere is a fight in every bottle.

<b>tttGIDEON
</b>tYou tappy heads better not tear
tdown my house.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
An attractive Woman, in her younger days a knockout, puts on
a record and starts to pop her fingers to the music as she
moves towards the center of the floor dancing by herself,
inviting anyone bold enough to join her.

A group of Men who haven't seen each other in years are
asking questions about news of old friends.

Okra is trying to get his camera working.

Herman is following M.C. through the crowd with his hand
resting on M.C.'s shoulder as if he were a blind person. His
racking COUGH is frightening.

An older couple dancing attract the attention of the crowd.
The man is wearing Stacy Adams shoes polished to see one's
face in them. He gives expression to his moves as if he and
the woman are talking with their bodies.

Junior and Pat try to bring in something more modern to outdo
the older couple.

Herman corners Hattie, trying to get her to sing.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tLook, you better get out of my face
tbefore I slap the living daylights
tout of you.

Harry stops the music.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tYou folks excuse me but you know we
thave a celebrity from out of the
tpast, our own nightingale. If you
thad any good times in your life,
tyou remember Hattie. She use to
tkeep those juke joints steaming. If
tMa Rainey and Bessie Smith were the
tstars, she was the sun. Let's get
tHattie to sing something from the
told days.

Hattie has started her nervous twitch again. She is so mad
that she bites her lip to keep from exploding.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tHarry always tries to be the king
tfish. I told him I'm a new person.
tI'm saved.

Harry signals an old man, PERCY, to start playing his guitar.
Percy starts to play but Hattie doesn't join him. He looks to
Harry for a sign of what to do. Hattie walks away.

Percy starts to SING by himself but someone puts a record on,
interrupting his singing. People are back to dancing.

A YOUNGER WOMAN is dancing with an OLDER MAN with such vigor,
forcing the old man to try to keep up, that people grow
concerned. People near him try to make him slow down but his
pride forces him to be ridiculous.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Linda sits with Sunny and Rhonda watching TV.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The noise has gotten louder, everyone talking at the top of
his voice.

Gideon is busy going around to everyone seeing if everything
is okay. Gideon and Suzie have worked up a sweat trying to
attend to everyone's needs.

Linda rejoins the party. She moves through the crowd and sees
Babe Brother standing next to Harry. She is disappointed and
stays at a distance.

Harry is with a group of people. Marsh tries to get Harry's
attention.

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tHarry, you will not remember me but
twe go back quite a ways. I'm glad
tHattie told me that you will be
there 'cause there is a matter that
thas been troubling me all these
tyears that maybe you can help me
tclear it up.

Harry stares into Marsh's eyes, then looks him over from head
to toe.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tMan, I can't talk to you now. I'm
tfilling in the gaps with these
tfolks.

Harry turns his back on Marsh. Marsh stands there looking at
Harry's profile. He turns and walks away.

The record ends. The Younger Woman and the Older Man wait for
the next record.

<b>tttYOUNGER WOMAN 
</b>tHow do you manage to keep in step
tand move around so like one of them
tyoung boys?

<b>tttOLDER MAN 
</b>tGet yourself a pace-maker like me.

Linda is standing by herself. She watches Babe Brother and
Harry walk towards the kitchen. Pat comes to talk to her.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tThese old folks can dance better
tthan I can. Get rid of that long
tface. Get one of these old farts to
tshow you how to do the Black
tBottom.

Okra, holding his camera, all of the attachments in one hand
and a glass in his other hand, tries to offer Hattie a drink.

<b>tttOKRA 
</b>tDon't be so stand-offish.

Hattie pushes him away. The drink spills on him. She turns
and walks away. He follows her.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Marsh sits in a chair opposite Harry. Babe Brother stands
behind Harry. Harry, knowing that Marsh is going to bring up
unpleasant things of the past, feels the need to get rid of
Babe Brother.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tSon, you haven't danced with your
twife all night.

Babe Brother is reluctant to leave, but Harry gives him a
nudge. He goes looking for Linda.

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tThere is something that I always
twanted to know. Tell me, how did
tthose boys die?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tNow who are we talking about?

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tMiss Clara's boy, Emory, to start
twith. The Johnson's Hocker was
tanother one...

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWasn't Hocker lynched?

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tYou know as well as I do that it
twas made to look like he was
tlynched. Now who would hang someone
tfrom a persimmon tree?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWhat difference does it make if
tit's persimmon, oak tree or
thuckleberry bush?

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Gideon, Babe Brother, and Linda go outside.

<b>EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT
</b>
The sounds of the party drift out from the house as Gideon,
Linda and Babe Brother talk.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tTell me, how come me and Suzie have
tto be mother and father to your
tchild? You never take the boy to
tthe park, circus or anything. If we
tdid not take him to church, he
twouldn't have any sense of
treligion.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tI think forcing him to go to church
twhen he really doesn't understand
tis not saving his soul. When he
tgets old enough to make up his own
tmind about religion, that will be
tbetter. It will be his intellectual
tdecision.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tIs that the way your parents raised
tyou?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tWhy, you don't want us to bring him
tover?

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tNo, it's that when do you have time
tto be parents to him? You guys
tdon't pick him up until nine, ten
tat night. You are into yourselves,
tas the saying goes. Spend some time
ttrying to be parents. Take him to
tthe mountains, fishing. You ought
tto let him get to know nature.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tWell, you are his grandfather. He
tis supposed to spend some time with
tyou. You're supposed to show him
tthose woodsy things and this and
tthat.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tJunior spends time with his child.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tOh here we go with that.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Okra is trying to get enough light for his old Polaroid
camera. M.C. takes a shade off a lamp and holds it next to
the Twins, nearly blinding them.

<b>tttWILLIAM 
</b>tHurry up and take this picture.

<b>tttFRED 
</b>tIf it wasn't for the NRA, colored
tpeople would have been the lost
ttribe.

<b>tttFLIM 
</b>tRemember what they use to call the
tNRA? Negro Raggedy-ass Army.

M.C. is still holding the naked lamp while Okra tries to take
pictures.

<b>INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tHocker's death almost caused a race
triot. A lot of innocent people
tcould have been hurt behind that.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tStrange as it may seem, it might
thave cleared the waters. Sometimes
tthe right action comes from the
twrong reason.

<b>EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT
</b>
Gideon, Babe Brother and Linda are just standing, facing one
another. Suzie comes out on the porch.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tDo you want your coat? It's cold
tout here.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tNo, I'm too hot now.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou better be careful. You'll get a

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI wouldn't care if I drop dead if

tt(beat)
tSon, you make me wish I was dead.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tGideon, don't say things like that.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tWhy does he always pick on me?

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tHe is just being like all parents,
tconcerned about the ones they love.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI don't need that kind of love. And
tI don't want to be reminded all the
ttime that Big Mama's grandmother
twas born in slavery. If you really
tcare about me, just tell me how I
tcan make money.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tBabe Brother, I'm going to take my

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tHe doesn't mean what he says.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tLet us go back in before the night
tof celebration becomes a night of
tme killing my son.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tNo. Before anyone moves, you two
tshake hands and don't carry it any

Linda gives Babe Brother a jab with her elbow. His hand
reaches out to Gideon.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
M.C. and Herman put the unshaded lamps next to Hattie so okra
can get a better picture. Percy starts to play his guitar.
Herman stands behind Percy.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tDon't make me say something nasty
tnow.

Percy starts to play an old religious number and Hattie
STARTS TO SING. Everything stops for a moment as her VOICE
fills the room.

Then most of the guests pick up and join in. M.C. moves the
lamp next to Percy so Okra can take his picture.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Marsh and Harry are getting quite loud in their argument. It
has become a kind of controlled anger.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI think if anybody had a hand in
tkilling Hocker, you ought to ask or
tyou should have asked Emory and
tChick.

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tChick was outright killed by a mob.
tHe killed a white man that owed him
tsome money and when they caught up
twith him, they tied him behind a
tcar and dragged him from out of the
thills back to town.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tThose boys never did have good
tluck.

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tYou damn right they didn't,
tespecially Emory, my cousin.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tEmory had made a lot of enemies. He
thad a big mouth.

M.C. and Okra come in wanting to take pictures. Marsh is
pretty mad about them intruding. M.C. sets the naked lamp in
front of Marsh, on the floor, almost between his legs.

Before Okra can get his camera set to shoot, Marsh leaves.
Harry smiles as if he had won a major victory. Herman flops
down in the empty chair and starts to COUGH.

Suddenly Suzie and Gideon burst into the kitchen holding up
one of the twins, Loviray. They carry the twin towards
Herman's seat. Herman is slow to react. Herman gets up very
slow. Finally, they are able to seat the twin.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tWhat's the problem here?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tShe has a fish bone caught in her
tthroat. Could all of you go in the
tother room? Gideon, get some bread
tand toast it quickly and find me
tthe cod liver oil.

The twin is holding her throat and PANTING like a fish out of
water. She is in a lot of pain. William, the twin brother, is
standing at the door with a tragic face.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
Gideon is trying to get out of bed. He sits on the side of
the bed and starts to COUGH.

<b>INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
Harry has his back to the camera, sitting in a chair facing a
wall. He is naked from the waist up. An empty plate is placed
not too far from where he is sitting. He is cutting an apple.
He licks the blade of his knife.

<b>INT. BABE BROTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
Babe Brother is asleep. Linda is dressed to go to work. She
throws his suit on the foot of the bed.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tAre you going to work or sleep all
tday?

He snores louder. She opens the window and pulls back the
cover. The cold air makes him draw up. On walking out, Linda
says in a rather hurt voice:

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tRemember, you promised to take
tSunny to Magic Mountain today.

Babe Brother slowly gets up holding his chest as if his heart
is bothering him.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
Gideon tries to put his pants on. He is too weak and sits
back on the bed with his pants only up as far as his knees.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
Suzie gets up to turn off the coffee kettle. When the kettle
WHISTLE dies away, the sound of Gideon's VOICE is heard
calling Suzie for help. The sound of his voice frightens her.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Suzie bursts into the room and then moves very slowly to
Gideon, who is sitting on the bed out of breath.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI'm worn out.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tJust stay in bed and rest.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI have to feed the chickens before
tthey wake everybody up.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou stay inside. I will see to
tthem.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI will appreciate that.

<b>INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
Suzie and Junior are sitting at the dining room table. Harry,
looking like he has just gotten out of bed, drags himself in.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tHow is everybody?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tTolerable well.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tHow did you sleep last night?

There is obvious hostility in Junior's tone. Harry senses
Junior's hostility and chooses to ignore it.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tAh, you young folks don't know how
tit is. How is Gideon today?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tHe wasn't able to get out of bed
ttoday.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI hope that it's nothing serious.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tHe has never gotten rid of the
tmalaria. He is usually up and at it
tthe next day. I'm going to make him
tfresh chicken broth.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tLet me earn my keep. I'll go out
tand get a hen and have it picked
tand ready for the pot. Try to make
thim some cow tea next time.

Junior stares at Harry. Harry returns Junior's stare and
Junior finds himself embarrassed. Junior looks down at his
pants leg and attempts to fix the crease in his pants by
making a wedge with his fingers and running his fingers along
the old crease.

As Harry walks towards the back door, he looks back at
Junior.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING
</b>
The pigeons take to the air like an explosion. The chickens
start to CACKLE and run about as Harry reaches for one with
his cane. The SOUND of the boy next door practicing with his
trumpet adds to the bedlam.

Suzie is standing on the steps, shouting to Harry. The noise
of the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next
door drown out Suzie's voice. Not getting Harry's attention,
she hurries down the steps.

Harry has caught a hen that is SCREAMING her head off. He
looks around and finds Suzie hurrying towards him.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tCan you watch Gideon for a while?
tOne of the girls is going into
tlabor. Junior is going to drive me
tover.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tYou just run along. I'll fix him
this soup. He will be all right.

<b>INT. ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Suzie and another woman who will be helping her are asleep.
Suzie is in the chair and the woman is asleep on the floor.
The woman who is in labor is reading a magazine and seems
somewhat bored.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Harry opens the door and slowly walks in. Gideon is asleep.
Harry picks up Gideon's pants from the back of the chair.
Gideon's false teeth fall to the floor.

<b>INT. ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
There is a flurry of activity; the woman is contracting.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
The untouched chicken broth sits on the night stand. Gideon
is TALKING in his sleep. Morning light filters through the
window shade. The room takes on a brownish tint. Gideon has
dark rings under his eyes and looks like he has aged
considerably.

<b>INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
Harry is reading the Bible. He runs his finger over the print
of the Bible. After reading the passage, he stares at the
empty plate on the floor for what seems like a long time. He
claps the Bible shut, causing a loud NOISE to ECHO through
the house.

<b>EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
Suzie is walking slowly up the steps.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
Suzie raises the window shade and is shocked to see the state
that Gideon is in.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tOh my Lord!

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
The room is crowded with people. Suzie is putting Gideon's
shirt on. Harry is leaning against the door. After having put
his shirt on, Suzie puts his house shoes on and directs Babe
Brother and Junior to hold him up while she tucks his shirt
in and puts on his suspenders.

It takes almost everyone to hoist Gideon. Linda and Pat push
the bed and night-stand out of the way as Babe Brother and
Junior struggle to lift Gideon. They almost stumble at the
door. Harry is left standing in the room alone.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Harry, Okra and Herman are trying to catch another chicken.
Herman is COUGHING badly and Okra is out of breath.

<b>tttOKRA 
</b>tYou think old Gideon is going to
tlive to see this month out?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWhen I came upon the valley of
tbones, the serpent said, "Make this
tyour home. Dry as my soul be,
theaven is lost to thee." We all got
tto make way.

Harry puts the rooster face to the ground and draws a
straight line. Harry lets the rooster go, but the rooster
stays motionless, unable to move.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tA chicken hates to see the preacher
tcoming to dinner.

Herman hands Harry the ax. Harry is poised over the chicken
with the ax, appreciating the moment. Harry raises the ax.
The SOUND of Rodney starting to practice his trumpet brings
the rooster out of the trance.

Before Harry can react, the rooster jumps away.

<b>tttOKRA 
</b>tHerman, you will have to catch the
tnext one 'cause I'm out of breath.

<b>tttHERMAN 
</b>tIf I have to chase after one, we
twon't eat.

A sack drops over the fence. Okra limps over to see what is
in the bag. He uses a stick to open the bag. He doesn't like
what he sees and throws the bag back over the fence.

<b>INT. VETERAN'S HOSPITAL, WARD - DAY
</b>
Suzie, Junior and Pat are standing around Gideon's bed. He is
in a room full of old veterans who are apparently nearing the
end.

Two old veterans, one white and the other black, sitting
opposite each other wearing medals, sit in silence staring
into each other's eyes.
A nurse empties an old man's urine bag. The old man doesn't
show any embarrassment about his predicament. Gideon looks at
how the patients are treated.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI don't want to stay here. 
tt(beat)
tWhere is Babe Brother?

<b>INT. HERMAN'S ONE ROOM HOUSE - DAY
</b>
M.C. is sitting on the bed, reading the job section of the
paper. Herman is putting Vicks Vapo-Rub in a bowl of boiling
water. He covers his head over the bowl with a towel. Okra is
sitting at the table examining his gun. He points it at the
floor, seeing if the sight is straight.

Harry is sitting at the table with Babe Brother. Harry is
showing him how to cheat at cards.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tNever play with someone's else's
tcards. You always get a new deck.
tLook at this card. See anything?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER
</b>tIt is just a regular card.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tSon, I can take everything you got
twith that deck. It is marked. Now
tI'm going to show you how to make
tsome money in case you get stuck
tsomewhere.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A moth flies around the light casting a shadow that floats
over everything. Suzie turns out the kitchen light and then
turns out the dining-room light. She goes to her room and
closes the door, leaving the room dark. A car headlight
passing outside casts a moving pattern that moves along the
wall.

The light reveals Harry's presence standing in the hall
doorway.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Gideon is being helped up the steps by his sons.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
Suzie is holding the door open while Gideon is carried in by
Junior and Babe Brother. Gideon is led to a chair. He still
looks awful.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tDoesn't he look a whole of lot
tbetter?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tWell, you look better than you did
tyesterday.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tNext time, I don't care how sick
tI'll be, don't take me back to the
tVeteran's Hospital.

Harry comes out of the bathroom, having just taken a bath.
Harry seems delighted to see Gideon again.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tBoy, I thought you were about to
tcross the river.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI tell you, I feel like a ghost.

Harry signals Babe Brother to come over to him.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tSon, would you do me a favor and
tsee if you could turn off that tap
tin the bathroom. My hand is too
tweak. And would you do me another
tfavor? I don't like asking this but
twould you clean the tub for me? I
thave trouble bending over.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tAnytime you need someone to do
tsomething for you, just let me
tknow.

Harry flops down on the couch. Suzie sets a cup of coffee on
the table for Gideon. Harry looks up from sharpening his
knife on a hand sharpening stone. He spits on it.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tThat smells like fresh coffee.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tLet me get you a cup?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tOnly if you can spare it.

Junior stands over Harry's shoulder looking at him sharpening
his knife. Harry feels uncomfortable with Junior standing
behind him. Harry looks up at him.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tSon, would you get me an old piece
tof newspaper?

Suzie sets a cup of coffee in front of Harry.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tLord if you ain't an angel.

Junior hands Harry the newspaper. Harry puts the paper under
his foot and trims his toenails with it. Harry is aware of
Junior standing over him.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tI will leave you something in my
twill.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
Junior looks in but Babe Brother is too busy trying to clean
the bathtub to notice anyone. Babe Brother complains to
himself.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tWhat in the hell...

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
Gideon and Suzie are in silhouette against the window.

The SOUND of the boy trying to play his horn next door
startles Gideon. Gideon turns to look out of the window
towards Mrs. Baker's house.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tIt's good to be able to hear that.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou must have been really sick.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tHow is the garden doing?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI need to get out there and get
tthose weeds out.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tHow is that hen doing? I was
tmeaning to pip her before I fell
tsick.

He takes a deep breath and blows it out.

<b>tttGIDEON (CONT'D)
</b>tI'm going to lie down. Take my,
thand and help me up, lest I fall.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Suzie helps Gideon to undress. Gideon loses hit balance but
catches himself on the side of the bed.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tOh, I couldn't have last another
tday in that hospital. You get weary
tbeing in the old soldiers home, old
tsoldiers and war stories. They wait
tto tell you their last story; the
tnext morning the nurse pulls a
tsheet over their face.

<b>INT. DINING ROOM, JUNIOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Junior is putting up a new light fixture. Pat hands him a
tool. Rhonda is washing dishes in the kitchen.

<b>tttPAT
</b>tHe just leeches off your parents.
tHe is a master at wearing out
twelcome. 

<b>tttJUNIOR
</b>tHarry is the kind of guy you would
tlove to take out in the woods and
tleave under a rock. 

<b>tttPAT
</b>tWhere does her get the power to
tsummon all his old raffish friends?
tThey all smell of moth balls. 

Junior slips on the ladder and the wires touch. There is a
big spark. All the lights in the house go out. 

<b>INT. BABE BROTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Linda is standing over the stove, sweating as she stirs a hot
pot of boiling soup.
Babe Brother and Harry are seated at the table playing cards.
Sunny is on the floor near his mother. Every time she move,
he follows her. Harry notices Sunny has his shoes on the
wrong foot and adds in a sarcastic way:

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tHow old is that boy?

Babe Brother looks at Sunny's shoe.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER
</b>tLinda, how come you don't see that
tSunny puts his shoes on right?

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tWhy in the h...

Close to tears, she turns and with exaggerated care, puts the
spoon down and gently puts Sunny in a chair. She starts to
untie his shoes. Sunny stares at her while she keeps wiping
her eyes.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tLet's give Dry Bones a call to see
tif he is coming or not. Okra likes
tto exaggerate, keep you waiting all
tnight.

Harry slowly gets to his feet and goes in the other room to
use the phone. Linda watches him go. She is deep in thought.

Babe Brother, attempting to cut the roast before it is ready,
is pushed aside by Linda, who is almost out of control with
rage.

<b>tttLINDA
</b>tWhy don't you wait?

Babe Brother, attempting to forcibly cut a piece of roast,
slings Linda's arm away. His hand accidentally hits her in
the eye.

Linda grabs the fork, poised to strike, but gains control of
herself She looks like a person who is on the verge of having
a breakdown. She goes back to putting the shoes on Sunny.

Babe Brother, feeling sorry, doesn't know what to do. He
automatically picks up the fork and washes it off. Linda
picks up Sunny.

<b>INT. DINING ROOM - BABE BROTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Linda is standing at the door, with a red eye, welcoming
Harry's friends, which seem to be a long line of sickly
people.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Linda is busy serving everyone, running in and out of the
kitchen bringing more things, and removing used plates, etc.
Linda's eye is swollen and discolored. The guests look at
Linda's eye and then cast a naughty-boy glance at Babe
Brother.

Linda stops serving to pay attention to an elderly man, who
deliberately bends one of her spoons. She catches another man
putting a fork in his pocket and an elderly lady putting a
cigarette out in one of her plates.

As she is about to confront the man about pocketing her
spoon, a peal of LAUGHTER forces her to turn around only to
witness a lady knocking over a glass filled with a green
drink with her elbow. The stain spreads across the table
cloth in an even manner like a single wave. She watches it
move from one end of the table to the other.

Harry is seated in the middle. The composition hints at The
Last Supper.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Linda is reading a book to Sunny, who has his coffee can of
marbles emptied on the bed. The NOISE from the party in the
next room is clearly heard. Every time she hears something
CRASHING to the floor, she wrenches. Babe Brother comes in
and stands in the doorway. Linda's eye is still swollen.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tYou okay?

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tI'm okay. Go back to your friends.

Babe Brother closes the door and leaves Linda reading stories
of Brer Rabbit to Sunny. She stops reading to look at him
playing marbles on the bed. She smiles.

<b>EXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Five weighty Women, dressed in church robes, and the Preacher
walk up Gideon's steps.

Suzie invites the church members in.

<b>tttPREACHER 
</b>tSister, we've come to see how you
twere doing. We came to ask if we
tcould pray over Gideon.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Gideon is asleep. The church members gather around his bed.
The Preacher puts his hand on the foot of the bed and
discovers that there is something strange under the covers.
Suzie looks at him and lifts the covers at the foot of the
bed. Gideon's feet are resting on dead leaves.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI put some Plummer Christian Leaves
tunder his feet to draw the fever
tout.

<b>tttPREACHER 
</b>tWhat else have you been giving him?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI crossed his stomach with cold oil
tand gave him some cow tea.

<b>tttPREACHER 
</b>tSuzie, I would think you would
tdepend on prayer rather than these
told fashion remedies. Let us read
tfrom the Bible.

The Preacher opens his Bible and reads silently. The choir
HUMS and begin to sway. Gideon's SNORING is very competitive.
The choir becomes louder. Gideon starts to TALK in his sleep.
Suzie is alarmed.

<b>CLOSE UP GIDEON'S EAR.
</b>
<b>THE SOUND OF A TRAIN WHISTLE IS HEARD.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:

<b>INT. PHOTO STUDIO, 1930 - DAY (DREAM EFX)
</b>
A lady steps upon the stage which has different backdrops.
She is the same lady in a photo that Gideon has hanging in
one of the kid's rooms. The photographer, who is off-screen,
asks about the background.

<b>tttPHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.) 
</b>tWhat scene would you like in the
tbackground?

<b>tttLADY 
</b>tSomething pleasant.

<b>tttPHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)

The woman shakes her head.

<b>tttPHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>tNatchez, cotton fields, Harlem,
tsunflowers, the Mississippi River.

<b>tttLADY 
</b>tPut the river behind me.

A large picture of the Mississippi appears behind the lady.
It changes from a painted backdrop to a moving picture. There
is a storm developing off in the distance. The SOUND of
thunder is heard. The picture in the background then changes
to a boy on a mule.

<b>EXT. WET DIRT ROAD - DAY (RAINING) (DREAM EFX)
</b>
The boy on the gray mule doesn't have a shirt on. A light
mist like rain covers him. Gideon walks along the picket
fence towards the boy on the mule.

Ahead of Gideon seems to be a puddle but as he approaches, he
discovers that it is an abyss. The boy and the mule on the
other side fade away. Everything FADES TO BLACK.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
The Preacher turns a page in the Bible. Gideon has his mouth
open like a fish trying to get air. The Choir continues to
SING. The Preacher gets down on his knees and holds Gideon's
hand; he bows his head. The Choir stops singing. The Bessie
Smith recording of "Muddy Water" is coming from somewhere in
the house. The Preacher looks around. Suzie is more puzzled.
She goes to find where the music is coming from.

<b>INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Suzie knocks on the door. No one answers. She peeps in. No
one is in the room.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM

The Preacher and the choir all have their hands on Gideon.
Suzie enters the room.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI don't know where that music is
tcoming from.

<b>INT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Junior and Pat are helping Linda carry her baggage inside as
Sunny reluctantly follows. It is obvious that Linda has left
Babe Brother.

<b>tttSUNNY 
</b>tI want my daddy.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tBoy, hush that noise and get in
tthis house. Make haste.

<b>tttSUNNY 
</b>tI want my daddy; I told you.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tRhonda, drag him in here. If you be

Pat, Linda and Junior put the suitcases down.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tNow you don't have to say anything
tif you don't want to.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tI want to hear what happened. My

tscarce as hen's teeth.

Linda looks down, embarrassed.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tRhonda, take Sunny in the backyard.
tTake a bowl so you can pick some
tstrawberries. Sunny will enjoy it.

Rhonda and Sunny leave. Pat turns on Junior about talking bad
about Babe Brother and Linda in front of Sunny.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tYou shouldn't talk about the boy's
tfather in front of him. This is
tfamily business and we have to pull
ttogether.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tWhether the boy hears it or not,
tthe man is still a jackass.
tEveryone should have some mother
twit.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tSomething just took control of him.
tHe stays out all night and comes
thome with a pocket full of money.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tIt's probably Harry, but I hate to
tmention his name, because every
ttime we say something about him
tsomething bad happens.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Rhonda and Sunny are looking under a strawberry plant. Sunny
has strawberry stains around his mouth and on his shirt.
Rhonda is putting her strawberries in the bowl. After getting
a bowl full, they lay on the grass, eating strawberries while
looking up at the clouds slowly drifting by.

<b>EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</b>
Babe Brother is driving along a country road while Harry,
sitting in the front seat next to him, yawns. Harry is tired.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tLet us walk awhile. I grow weary
twhen I sit still too long.

Babe Brother's car stops in an orchard-like area.

<b>EXT. ORCHARD - DAY
</b>
Babe Brother and Harry get out of the car. They walk on a
path that takes them under low hanging tree limbs. It gets
darker as they go deeper into the orchard. Babe Brother finds
the going rough and loses his footing.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tGive me your arm lest you fall.

Harry has to help him stay on his feet. Babe Brother finds it
necessary to take Harry's arm. Babe Brother stops and Harry
walks a few more steps ahead and waits for Babe Brother. Just
ahead sitting on a branch is a huge white owl camouflaged by
tree branches.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER
</b>tI could swear I heard my son call
tme.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tYou probably heard the wind
tstirring up those dead leaves over
tthere.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI heard his voice as clear as day.
tI better get back. Maybe something
tis wrong.

Babe Brother turns and starts hurrying back before Harry can
object. He walks slowly after Babe Brother who is doubling
the distance between himself and Harry as he runs through the
orchard to his car. Harry stops and looks around.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
Pat, Linda and Junior are seated at the table. The suitcases
are in the middle of the floor.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tI told Babe Brother that if Harry
tsets foot in our house again, I'm
ttaking Sunny and leaving. Just as I
tsaid that, here come Harry and his

tup the steps.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tIs that how you got that black eye?

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tDon't ask that.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tNo, this was an accident.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tSure.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tIt was unintentional.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tBabe Brother reminds me of the
tstory of the man who wanted to be
tsizable. He wanted to be tall but
twhat he was really short on was

tpeople had moon fever were treated
twith leeches.

The phone rings and Junior goes to pick it up. Linda's and
Pat's attention is focused on the phone. Junior hands the
phone to Linda.

<b>tttJUNIOR (CONT'D)
</b>tIt's that nut of yours.

Linda hesitates but Pat takes the phone from Junior and puts
it in her hand.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tWhat do you want? 
tt(beat)
tNo. Nothing happened to him.

Sunny and Rhonda enter. Linda turns to look. Sunny's hands
and face look bloody from eating strawberries. She puts the
phone down and examines his dirty face. Pat brings Linda a
wet towel.

<b>INT. THE BAKERS' GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
MR. BAKER, a well built black man in his late 40's, is making
a new fishing pole. He is very involved. Mrs. Baker is
standing beside him with her arms folded. She stares at him.
Mr. Baker glances at her. 

<b>tttMR. BAKER
</b>tWhat are you doing?

<b>tttMRS. BAKER 
</b>tCounting the gray hairs in your

</b>tHe is in his pigeon cage.

<b>tttMR. BAKER 
</b>tI'm sorry he got those birds.

<b>tttMRS. BAKER 
</b>tYou know the man next door is near
tdeath.

Mr. Baker doesn't answer. He pauses for a moment of thought.
Mrs. Baker sees that she is not going to get a response from
her husband. She picks up an eyelet and Mr. Baker looks at
her as if to say, keep your hands off. She gets the message
and lays the eyelet back on the work bench.

<b>tttMRS. BAKER (CONT'D)
</b>tHe must have gotten rid of those
tchickens. You don't hear them

Mr. Baker admires his pole. He looks very closely at the
details of his work.

Rodney comes in, polishing his horn. Mr. Baker's expression
changes as he watches Rodney out of the corner of his eye.
Mrs. Baker gives Rodney a motherly pat on the head. Rodney
puts the trumpet to his mouth.

<b>tttMR. BAKER 
</b>tDon't blow that thing in here. You

<b>EXT. STREET - DAY

There is a man lying on a bus bench with his belongings. A
spotted dog is standing guard next to the bench. The dog's
reflection is caught in a puddle of water. The dog has

Babe Brother sits in his car with the windows up. Junior
tries to talk to him but Babe Brother will not roll down the

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tRoll down the window and let me

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Suzie is sitting in a chair; her head is bent forward. Gideon
is TALKING in his sleep. She awakes and nods off again. Harry
sticks his head in.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tHow is he doing?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tAs long as he keeps his throat
tclear, he is able to get some rest.

<b>tttHARRY

<b>INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Okra is painfully standing on his bad feet. He is in his
security-guard uniform, holding a bouquet of greens. As Suzie
comes in, Okra tries to stand upright at attention.

<b>tttOKRA 
</b>tI brought you these greens and some
tsalt meat.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tThat is very thoughtful of you. I
thaven't had time to tend to my

Suzie takes the greens and puts them on the counter. She
squeezes Okra's hand as a thank you. She pours him a cup of
coffee. Okra eases down into the chair. He crosses his legs
and starts massaging his feet.

Suzie get herself a cup of coffee and sits opposite him. She
stretches and tries to hold back a yawn. Okra looks at her in
a slightly desirous way.

<b>tttOKRA 
</b>tYou know Gideon and I are lodge
tbrothers and it has always been a

tsomething happens to our brother.

Suzie keeps herself under control; she tries to find words to
say. She stands up.

Harry sees that it is safe to leave. He sees Sunny sweeping
in Gideon's room. Gideon is sound asleep. Sunny is sweeping
around the bed.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Harry comes in and Hattie and Suzie stop talking. Harry is
aware that he was the subject. The SOUND of the boy next door
playing his horn is heard.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tGood afternoon, ladies.

<b>tttSUZIE
</b>tGood afternoon to you.

Harry waits for Hattie to respond but it is obvious that
Hattie isn't about to speak to him.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tI'm going to check on Gideon.

Harry moves out of her way to let her go by. Hattie doesn't
even give him a glance. Harry continues to look at her as she
disappears into Gideon's room.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tAs God is my witness, I have never
tdone anything to that woman.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou must have done something to

</b>tSince she has repented, all she
tdoes is throw stones.

</b>tHattie is a different person now.

</b>tOnly if you are a good man, a

Harry takes his time in looking for an answer.

tbut if he stops practicing, he
twouldn't be perfect in what he does

<b>INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Hattie enters Harry's room. She goes through his things. She
reads one of his letters. As she walks over to the window
reading his letter, she steps on the plate, cracking it.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI want you to leave.

Harry looks sad and suddenly a lot older as if what she said
has taken away some of his life.

<b>tttHARRY

tM.C. is coming by to pick me up

twould like for you to put with
tthose baby pictures over your
tdresser. It's better than being in
tmy dusty wallet with addresses and
tnames of people who are no longer
ton this earth.

Suzie takes the picture. She seems as if she has doubts about
having asked Harry to leave.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tI'll say my so-longs to Gideon
tbefore I leave and I truly wish
tthat he will get well.

Suzie continues to look at the picture.

</b>
Hattie is reading Harry's letters when he appears behind her.
Hattie turns but is not surprised or concerned about Harry.
She hands him back his letters, looks at him for a moment and
goes. Harry looks down at the cracked dish.

<b>INT. HERMAN'S HOUSE - EVENING (RAIN)
</b>
M.C. and Herman are packing. Okra is all dressed up with a
pair of Stacy Adams shoes that make his feet look
exaggeratedly long. Babe Brother and Harry are sitting at a
table playing blackjack. Okra picks up one thing at a time,
making the packing much harder. There is a stack of old dusty
78 record; Okra, trying to step over the records, kicks over
a box of mothballs that roll across the floor. Okra has to
step over boxes of toilet paper.

<b>tttOKRA 
</b>tWhy did you buy so much toilet
tpaper?

<b>tttM.C.
</b>tI got that on the job when I was a
tjanitor. They didn't pay me.

Harry picks up an old cigar box that falls opens. Dice,
shotgun shells, some spent .38 slugs and an old rusty knife,
a crab apple switch, land on the floor. Harry picks up the
knife.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWhose old piece of knife is this?

<b>tttHERMAN 
</b>tThat was my brother's knife.

Harry gives the knife to Babe Brother and signals him to put
it in his pocket.

The SOUND of the thunder has an unreal violence to it.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI don't want to wear out welcome,
tbut you can stay in someone's heart
tlonger than you can stay in their
thouse. Come with us, boy. We are
tgoing to have a good time.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tThis would be a bad time for me to
tleave.

</b>tWe are going where the action is.
tAin't that right, Okra?
tt(then back to Babe
ttBrother)
tLet's play for a couple of bucks
tunless you want to start off with
ttwo bits and work our way up.
tt(beat)
tWhat would you give to be rich?

Babe Brother humps his shoulder. Babe Brother looks at his
hand.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tHad Moms and Pops given me my share
tof what was mine, I could have been
trich by now. Linda and I had it all
tworked out.

Harry wins the first hand.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI know your mind is on your wife
tbut you should never treat a woman
tas an equal. You want to get your
twife back, get another woman, one
tof those big hip women that will
tride you till you sweat.

Harry wins another hand. M.C. and Okra are still packing
while Herman is eating Argo Starch.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tDouble the stakes?

Babe Brother agrees but his thoughts are obviously somewhere
else. Harry studies his hand and looks at Babe Brother; he
puts down his hand. Babe Brother wins and is quite pleased.
The next series of hands are won by Babe Brother.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tM.C., you ever heard of a real man
thaving one woman?

<b>tttM.C. 
</b>tNo, lord!

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWhen one woman puts you out, you
thave another to take you in. You
tdon't drive around without a spare
ttire, do you? The more mules you
thave hitched, the easier it is to
tplough.

Harry loses another hand and Babe Brother suddenly has a pile
of money.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tHerman, let me borrow a few bucks.

Herman stand over him with a roll of bills and peels off
several.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tBless you. Bless you.

Herman is standing behind Babe Brother, SINGING to himself.

<b>tttHERMAN 
</b>tIn the ground there is a hole and
tgreen grass growing around the
thole. Now in the hole there is tree
tand green grass growing all around
tthe tree. Now there is a hole in

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tLet me share something with you.

Harry stops and thinks for a while.

<b>tttHARRY (CONT'D)
</b>tHattie is a snake. That woman broke
tup so many homes and caused a lot
tof misery and because she calls
therself getting religion everything
tis put right.

Okra is taking several shotguns out of the closet.

<b>tttOKRA 
</b>tThese damn things are unloaded,
tain't they?

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tIt's important to know the
tdifference between the incoming
tfire and the outgoing fire. As Amos

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tLet me go by the house first.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tWe will wait for you as long as we
tcan. I got to get my things from
tyour mother's house.

Babe Brother hurries out. M.C., Herman and Okra flop down in
chairs and on the bed and look at their watches.

Harry sits at the table tapping out a rhythm on the table and
WHISTLING very softly to himself. Suddenly Harry sees that
Babe Brother left the pile of money on the table. A look of
concern comes over his face.

<b>EXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN)
</b>
It is raining hard. Babe Brother gets out of the car. Running
to get out of the rain, he slips and falls; he tries to get
up but slips and falls again. He gets up and walks slowly up
the steps as if he doesn't care whether he gets wet or not.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)
</b>
Suzie helps him to take his wet coat off. She goes into the
kitchen, puts his coat in front of the stove. The knife falls
out. She picks it up and looks at it like she would throw it
away but Babe Brother takes it.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI need to get my suitcase out of

and rush to see what is going on.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - RAINY NIGHT

Babe Brother and Junior are both reaching for the knife.
Junior is on top of Babe Brother, who is stretched out on the
table trying to reach the knife. Junior grabs the knife first
and Babe Brother flips over to defend himself. Babe Brother
grabs Junior's wrist as Junior tries to push the knife
against his throat.

Suzie comes in and grabs part of the knife with her hand and
Junior's wrist with her other hand. Pat and Linda try to pull
the two men apart while pleading with Junior.

Blood drips from Suzie's hand to the table, forming a pool
under Babe Brother's head.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tStop it! Stop it! Look what you are
tdoing!

Babe Brother's eyes are rolled to the back. Junior's eyes are
huge; he has an animal look on his face. The SOUND of
struggling people breathing heavily is amplified. The pool of
blood on the table grows larger.

Junior slowly becomes aware of the blood and his body
relaxes. He calmly releases the knife.

Junior takes his mother's hand.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tSomeone get some lard out of the
tice box.

Pat attempts to get the lard but pain in her stomach forces
her to sit down. Linda gets the lard out and hands it to
Junior. Babe Brother raises himself. The blood from Suzie's
dripping from his head. Rhonda is trying to hold Sunny back.

Junior holds his mother's hand under the faucet. It is a deep
cut. The bleeding won't stop.

Pat is sitting at the blood-stained table unable to move. She
is PANTING, sweating, and holding her stomach. Linda is
caught between trying to help Suzie and attending to Pat.

Babe Brother helps to make a wad of cloth to press in her
hand to Stop the bleeding.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tYou are going to need some

Suzie attempts to go see Gideon but Babe Brother and Junior
turn her to the door. Going through the kitchen door, Junior
intentionally turns his back to Babe Brother. Babe Brother
stares at Junior's back as he walks ahead.

The automatic doors open and Junior, Babe Brother and Suzie
enter. There is a long line of people waiting at the
registration window as well as groups of people filling out
forms. Other patients are seated and waiting patiently to see
the doctor.

Suzie finally gets to the registration window. A NURSE,
white, 25, with extremely long fingernails that curve back
around, is surprisingly sympathetic.

<b>tttNURSE 
</b>tWhat sort of emergency are you here
tfor?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI cut my hand.

<b>tttNURSE 
</b>tLet me take a look at it.

Suzie puts her hand through the window. The Nurse stands up
to get a better look. The Nurse takes the wad out of her
hand. The bleeding has stopped.
The Nurse takes a deep breath. The Nurse glances up to notice
the blood stains on the back of Babe Brother head.

<b>tttNURSE (CONT'D)
</b>tAre you all together?

form. The Nurse looks again at Babe Brother's head.

</b>tDo you need to see the doctor too?

in chairs, on the floor and on the sofa.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN)
</b>
Gideon opens the refrigerator and starts taking out bowls of
food and placing them on the table. He puts on a pot of
coffee.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tSuzie.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RAIN) (LATER)
</b>
Gideon is busy eating almost everything in sight. A group of
mystified and sleepy faces appear at the door. Pat, Linda,
Rhonda and Sunny are all looking rather dumbfounded.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING
</b>
Everything is wet from the night's rain. The garden looks
more like a graveyard. Moisture drips from the sunflowers.

Gideon's nervous looking rooster jumps the fence and starts
to CROW.

Skip is out early throwing rocks at his birds. The rocks land
on Gideon's roof.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
Babe Brother and Junior help Suzie out of the car. She has
her left hand bandaged. They are extremely exhausted. They
walk up the porch to find Harry holding the door open.

<b>tttHARRY 
</b>tI can't believe what I heard took
tplace.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
On seeing Suzie, Sunny jumps up, knocking the can of marbles
over the kitchen floor. He runs to give Suzie a hug. Sunny
wants to touch her bandaged hand, but Linda stops him.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tHow is Gideon doing?

<b>tttRHONDA 
</b>tHe is asleep now, but he was up all
tnight eating.

As Suzie goes to Gideon's room, she comes face to face with
Harry. She doesn't say anything.

<b>tttHARRY
</b>tI came to pick up my things.

<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Gideon is SNORING loudly. On the night-stand is a plate with
food left on it. Suzie feels his forehead.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
Harry sadly gets up. He looks at Babe Brother. Linda steps in
front of Babe Brother.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tYou ought to go see how your father
tis doing and then wash that blood
toff you and change shirts.

Babe Brother is surrounded by Linda and Sunny who has his
eyes fixed on Harry. They move as one heading for the
bedroom.

Harry seems a lot older. He sadly walks towards the kitchen
with his coffee cup.

LOW ANGLE SHOT: Harry is slowly walking towards the MARBLES
that are scattered over the kitchen floor.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Pat, Linda, Junior, Rhonda, Babe Brother, Sunny and Suzie are
all standing around waiting for Gideon to wake up.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tGideon.

Gideon's only response is to SNORE louder.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tHow long is Harry going to hang
taround?

Babe Brother is in a corner all by himself. He looks down
when Pat asks the question about Harry.

A loud CRASHING SOUND comes from the kitchen.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Harry is trying to raise himself from the floor. He pauses
for a moment and then collapses. Harry is in a lot of pain.
Harry's body contorts and then remains still.

Babe Brother, Junior, Pat, and Linda, Suzie run in. Suzie
tries to see if he is alive. Babe Brother tries to give him
mouth to mouth resuscitation but Linda pulls him away. Junior
tries to push down on Harry's chest.

Babe Brother stares down at Harry and then goes slowly back
into the living room. Pat is on the phone dialing the
paramedics. Everyone stands around Harry.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Two PARAMEDICS work on Harry. One of the paramedics is a
young Asian. The other is white with red hair. They listen
for a heart beat and shake their heads in a negative manner.
They pack up their medical case. The Asian's accent is very
difficult to understand.

<b>tttWHITE PARAMEDIC 
</b>tThere is nothing we can do for him.

The Paramedics start to leave without the body.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tWell, aren't you going to take him
twith you?

<b>tttASIAN PARAMEDIC 
</b>tIf he had died in our care, we
twould be required to take him.
tSince we found him dead, you will
thave to wait for the county to pick
thim up.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tHow long will that take?

<b>tttWHITE PARAMEDIC 
</b>tThat would depend on how busy it
tis. I'm sorry.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE:
</b>
<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Harry is stretched out on the floor. A blanket covers
everything except his shoes.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
Hattie, Marsh, Okra, Herman, and M.C. all come in. Marsh
looks cheerful.

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tWhat happened?

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tHe slipped on some marbles that
twere on the floor. Then his heart
tgave out.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tt(to Sunny)
tI told you to always put those
tmarbles up and not to leave them
tjust anywhere.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tThe poor thing is not to blame.
tRhonda, take Sunny for a walk.

Marsh hands Rhonda several dollars.

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tHere, go around to the store and
tbuy what you want.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tWould anybody object if I take a
tlook at him?

<b>tttHERMAN 
</b>tI don't think Harry would like it.

Hattie goes over and pulls the blanket back. Okra, M.C. and
Herman hurry over to take a quick glance. They huddle behind
Hattie, peeping over her shoulder.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tI never noticed how big his eyes
twere.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE:
</b>
<b>INT. BATHROOM - EVENING
</b>
Linda is helping Babe Brother wash Suzie's blood out of his
hair. She dries his hair with a towel. Sonny hands Babe
Brother a clean shirt, Gideon's shirt. He puts it on.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Gideon is sitting on the edge of his bed looking through the
scraps of leftovers on his plate. He puts his pants on. As he
moves about, his joints SNAP and POP. He picks up the empty
plate.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Babe Brother is on the phone with the county morgue. He gets
into an argument with the people on the other end of the
phone.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tMister... Mister... Excuse me for
tcutting you off but we pay taxes
ttoo. We should not have to pay you
tto take a 24-hour lunch break.

Babe Brother hands the phone to Linda.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER (CONT'D)
</b>tThe coroner said that he was out
there, and knocked on the door and
tno one was here.

Junior steps over the body, holding a pot of coffee in his
hand.

The Preacher is sitting with Suzie talking in a low voice.

Pat, Rhonda and Sunny come in with boxes of chicken snack.

Linda hangs up the phone.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tHe doesn't know when he will be out
tthis way again. Somebody downtown
tis going to hear about this.

<b>tttM.C. 
</b>tThey just do that in the colored
tneighborhood. If he had been white,
tthey would had him on his feet and
tout of here.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tI got white meat and I got dark
tmeat. I know it sounds cruel but we
thave to eat.

Gideon comes in walking very slowly, holding his plate out.
Everyone is shocked. Gideon is completely unaware of the
period that he has been sick.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWhat, are you having another party?

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tYou better come sit down. You are
tstill sick.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tGal, you're talking to John Henry.
tWhen was I sick?

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tYou have been out for almost three
tweeks.

The Preacher gives him a pat on the back and shakes Gideon's
hand.

<b>tttPREACHER 
</b>tWe had long conversations with the
tLord about you. Didn't we, Sister
tSuzie? I said we need him down
there, Lord.

Gideon smiles in appreciation. He pushes his plate out to
Pat, indicating that he wants it filled with chicken. Gideon
is about to bite into the chicken when he notices Harry's
feet sticking out. He points with the chicken in his hand. He
has a mystified look on his face.

<b>tttOKRA 
</b>tThat's our friend Harry.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tNot our Harry?

<b>tttOKRA 
</b>tI wish it wasn't.

Gideon seems to weaken for a moment.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWhat happened to him?

<b>tttHATTIE
</b>tHe dropped dead.

<b>tttHERMAN
</b>tHattie, you can be so mean.

<b>tttGIDEON
</b>tHow long has he been dead?

<b>tttSUZIE
</b>tSince this morning.

<b>tttGIDEON
</b>tWhat happened to your hand?

<b>tttSUZIE
</b>tI cut it on an old rusty knife.

Gideon is deeply concerned.

<b>tttGIDEON
</b>tWhat did you put on it?

<b>tttSUZIE
</b>tIt's healing now.

Gideon looks over at his two sons as if to ask them about it.

<b>tttGIDEON
</b>tI hope you will take care of your
tmother better than that when I'm
tgone.

Junior and Babe Brother both have their heads down. Linda and
Sunny move closer to Babe Brother.

<b>tttGIDEON (CONT'D)
</b>tBabe Brother, is that my shirt that
tyou're wearing?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER
</b>tYes.

<b>tttGIDEON
</b>tHow come you're not wearing my
tshoes?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER
</b>tThey're too big.

Gideon stares at Babe Brother and then looks around towards
Harry.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWhen is the undertaker coming?

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tThey can't say. I'll try calling
tthem again.

Hattie moves closer to Herman and speaks so only he can hear.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tWhy don't M.C. and you drag him to
tyour house?

Herman moves away with a look of disdain.

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tHarry didn't have any relatives
tliving, did he?

<b>tttM.C. 
</b>tHarry was in the world by himself.

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tSomebody has to take responsibility
tfor him.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tWhy don't you look through his
tthings to see if you can find a
tnumber?

Okra, Marsh, Hattie, Herman, and M.C. go to Harry's room,
leaving Suzie and Gideon sitting opposite each other with the
door to the kitchen separating them. Junior, the Preacher and
Pat are eating chicken. Linda is on the phone trying to get
through to the morgue.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tHow do you like that? They hung up
tin my face. I'll fix them. I'll
tshow them just how mean I can get.

She rapidly dials the number. There is a BUSY SIGNAL.

<b>tttLINDA (CONT'D)
</b>tThis has been a nightmare.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - RIGHT
</b>
M.C. and Marsh are going through Harry's boxes. They take out
old blues records, books, a big Bible, and books on Dunbar.

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tThese are letters to his son.

Hattie reads the letters in a corner by herself. She stops
reading for a moment.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tI still don't know if I was right
tabout Harry.

She seems frustrated with herself not being able to come to
terms about who was Harry.

<b>EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT
</b>
A crowd of people are standing around looking at Gideon's
house.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The Preacher is sleep in his chair, SNORING loudly. Babe
Brother and Linda are sitting together, talking in almost a
whisper. Sunny is asleep in his lap. Babe Brother is finding
it difficult to apologize for his recent behavior.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI have more sense than to give up
teverything, my family, you and
tSunny. It wasn't me, I mean the
treal me inside my body. I'm glad
tit's over. It's like a veil has
tbeen lifted.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tLike a veil has been lifted?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tIt's like I've been swimming in
tmuddy waters.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tLike muddy waters?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tIt was like all those things old
tcountry people try to tell you what
thell is like.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tYou were in hell?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI couldn't believe the things I was
tdoing. It was like an internal
tstruggle going on inside my body.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tDo you think you won?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tIt was nip and tuck.

<b>tttLINDA 
</b>tAnd what lesson have we learned
tfrom all of this, Babe Br... Sam...
tI mean Samuel?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI guess it proves you really care
tabout me. You hung in there.

Linda looks at Babe Brother for a length of time.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tWhen are you boys going to fix that
troof?

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tSoon as I rest a bit. 
tt(beat)
tI meant as soon as we are back to
tnormal again, anytime.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tHere I am thinking about myself
twhen poor Harry is resting on the
tfloor of the kitchen.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Harry's body lies there motionless.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
The Preacher is SNORING violently.

Babe Brother is asleep on the floor. Sunny is asleep sitting
on Linda's lap. Linda's feet rest on Babe Brother's chest.

Junior and Pat are looking at the baby pictures. Pat is
holding her hand across her stomach feeling the baby kick.
Rhonda is asleep in a chair.

Suzie and Gideon are sitting at the dining room table. Suzie
is cutting the dead leaves off of a small potted plant.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tIt feels like a storm has passed...
tHattie read some of Harry's letters
tto a woman he had a child by. The
tchild had died and he was writing
tto give her some comfort. Hattie
tdidn't know that deep down at the
tbottom of Harry's hate, there was
tsome love.

The SOUND of Rodney's trumpet is heard but is no longer
irritating.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tDid I ever tell you the story about
tthe man who wanted to make his own
tmind up about heaven and hell? He
tdidn't want nobody's opinion but
this own.

Suzie doesn't pay any attention; she is involved with her
potted plant. Gideon looks over at the Preacher, who is still
asleep.

<b>tttGIDEON (CONT'D)
</b>tHe's going to check out heaven
tfirst. He gets a round trip ticket
tto heaven. He gets in heaven and
tfinds it just like back home.
tPeople dripping with sweat, working
tin the fields, hardly surviving. He
tasked a man who was getting a drink
tof water, "I thought the streets
twere paved with gold." "They are
tbut you won't see them," he said.
t"Boy, you got to work day and night
tcause idleness is sinfulness." So
the takes the other half of his
tticket and takes the express to
thell. He sees people stretched out
ton their backs kicking back,
tpicking their teeth. "Man, this is
ta dream." He asked, "What's you'll
tdoing?" They all hollered back,
t"Sinning." The devil was shaking
thands with everyone and came up to
thim and said, "Please to meet you."
tHe asked, "I thought you'll was
tsupposed to be burning in fire."
tSomeone said, "Man, ain't no fire
tdown here except under that pot of
tchitlins." The man was going go ask
tthe preacher back on earth...

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI don't want to hear any joke about
tcolored people being in hell.
tYou're being irreverent.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tI'm almost finished. I'm about to
tcome to the punch line.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI don't want to hear any tales
tabout colored people...

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tBut these are white people,
tanybody. The punch...

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tI don't care to hear any jokes
tabout people being in hell. This
tcut on my hand reminds me that it
tis nothing to laugh at.

<b>tttGIDEON 
</b>tIt's only a tale.

The RATTLING of pots and dishes starts suddenly. Harry's body
starts to sway gently as if he were about to get up.
Everyone is frozen. Babe Brother and Linda remain asleep. The
rocking caused by the earthquake doesn't wake them.

M.C., Herman, Okra and Hattie and Marsh enters the dining
room. Harry's feet are seen in the kitchen still swaying.

<b>tttM.C 
</b>tIs that an earthquake?

<b>tttHERMAN 
</b>tIt's something.

Babe Brother wakes in a sweat and sits next to Linda like a
child needing protection.

<b>tttBABE BROTHER 
</b>tI'm cold. I need to get out into
tthe sunlight.

<b>tttJUNIOR 
</b>tWhat is it, noontime?

<b>tttPREACHER
</b>tI wonder how they going to bury
tthis man.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tPlant him in Potter's Field. He
tdoesn't need a marked grave.

<b>tttHERMAN
</b>tHattie, your true colors are
tunbearable. You got some mean ways.
tDon't worry about the boy getting a
tburial. He still has some friends
tleft on this earth.

<b>tttHATTIE 
</b>tHis winter has come and gone and I
tknow right now he is answering for
ta lot of things.

M.C., Okra and Herman move away from Hattie.

<b>tttPREACHER 
</b>tIt is my job to pray for his soul
tand I would like to do that.

<b>EXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Rhonda is sitting next to Sunny on the front porch. She has
an angry expression. Sunny is trying to please her by
offering her his airplane.
He pushes the airplane near her and she pushes it back with a
violent shove. He persists in offering her his airplane.

A crowd of people is still standing around in front of
Gideon's house.

<b>tttMAN 
</b>tHey boy, you still got that dead
tman in your house.

Sunny and Rhonda don't respond. A middle-aged woman,
VIRGINIA, one of Gideon's neighbors, passes Sunny and Rhonda,
knocks on the screen door and goes in.

<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>tttVIRGINIA 
</b>tI know you all haven't had a chance
tto cook or do anything with that
tdead man in your kitchen. You must
tbe starved to death. Some of your
tneighbors have got together and we
tset up a picnic table in my
tbackyard with food and everything
tto feed all you all.

<b>tttSUZIE 
</b>tVirginia, that is so wonderful of
tyou all!

<b>tttMARSH 
</b>tIf the dead wagon comes, we ought
tto leave a note telling them we'll
tbe down the street at a picnic.

Gideon comes back in with Suzie, who is helping tie his tie.
They all line up and file out the front door with Suzie and
Gideon leading the way. Pat is holding her stomach with a
thoughtful look on her face.

<b>tttPAT 
</b>tI think we better be ready.

Junior looks concerned as he follows Pat out the door. Sunny
follows Rhonda, who is still mad at him. Babe Brother and
Linda are the last ones out. Babe Brother takes a long look
in the direction of Harry as Linda pulls him out. She slams
the door.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Harry's body lies on the floor. On the kitchen sink are
Suzie's jars of cuttings, which have developed a maze of
roots.
