tMITCHELL moves towards the garage of the car wash/auto
trepair establishment.  He moves into a larger room, full of
tdiscarded auto parts.  The buzzing noise is coming from an

</b>ttProbably half a dozen traffic

</b>ttCan't get off that shitty dump they

</b>ttHow does the family survive?

</b>ttWhat about Doreen?

</b>ttShe...she was a friend of mine.

tIn the corner of the room sits ABBOTT, DOLORES'S husband.
tABBOTT has suffered a massive stroke, and seems to be
tcompletely paralyzed.  His presence, however, is intense and
tpowerful.

tMITCHELL frequently looks over to ABBOTT during his
tconversations with DOLORES.  ABBOTT is always watching him
tlike a hawk, making MITCHELL uneasy.

</b>ttDolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttDo they have any reputation for
ttdrugs?

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttNo, nothing like that.  The Ottos
ttare what I'd call model citizens.
ttThey're regular at town meetings.
ttThey give their opinions  in a

</b>ttAnd they loved Bear.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttOh yes.  Like I said, they always

tMITCHELL turns around to find the picture of BEAR.

tIt is right behind ABBOTT'S head, so MITCHELL has to divide
this attention between the cute PHOTOGRAPH of BEAR clutching

tMITCHELL walks into the OTTO residence.  It is a large two-

tsheets of brightly colored cloth - tie-dyes and Indian
tmadras - that hang from wires.

tOn a low brick platform in the centre of the main chamber is
ta large wood-burning stove.  A few feet from the stove,
tsitting on an overstuffed cushion, is HARTLEY OTTO.

tHARTLEY is listening to music on his headphones.  He is very
tstoned.  WANDA moves over, and pulls the headphones off her
thusband's head.

</b>ttA cup of tea would be nice.

ttWould it be alright if I sit down

tWANDA stares at MITCHELL.  No response.  MITCHELL waits a
tbeat, then seats himself rather uncomfortably on a large
tpillow.  He is unsure whether to cross his legs, or fold
tthem under his chin.

<b>ttttMITCHELL (CONT'D)

</b>ttIt should be said that my task is to
ttrepresent the Walkers only in their

<b>ttttWANDA
</b>ttWho did they get for that?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttYou are angry, aren't you, Mrs.

ttweapon against whoever caused that
ttbus to go off the road.

<b>ttttWANDA
</b>ttDolores?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttIt's my belief that Dolores was
ttdoing exactly what she'd been doing
ttfor years.  Besides, the school
ttboard's insurance on Dolores is
ttminimal.  A few million at the very
ttmost.  The really deep pockets are
ttto be found in the town, or in the
ttcompany that made the bus.

<b>ttttWANDA
</b>ttYou think someone else caused the
ttaccident?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttMrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing
ttas an accident.  The word doesn't
ttmean anything to me.  As far as I'm
ttconcerned, somebody somewhere made a
ttdecision to cut a corner.  Some
ttcorrupt agency or corporation
ttaccounted the cost variance between
tta ten-cent bolt and a million dollar
ttout-of-court settlement.  They
ttdecided to sacrifice a few lives for
ttthe difference.  That's what's done,
ttMrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so
ttmany times before.

tHARTLEY returns with the tea.

<b>ttttHARTLEY
</b>ttBut Dolores said she saw a dog and
tttried to...

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttHow long has Dolores been driving
ttthat bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times
tthas she steered clear of danger?
ttWhat went wrong that morning?

tMITCHELL takes the cup of tea.

<b>ttttMITCHELL (CONT'D)
</b>ttSomeone calculated ahead of time
ttwhat it would cost to sacrifice
ttsafety.  It's the darkest, most
ttcynical thing to imagine, but it's
<b> 
</b>





ttabsolutely true.  And now, it's up
ttto me to make them build that bus
ttwith an extra bolt, or add an extra
ttyard of guard rail.  It's the only
ttway we can ensure moral
ttresponsibility in this society.  By
ttwhat I do.

tPause.

<b>ttttWANDA
</b>ttSo you're just the thing we need.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttWANDA
</b>ttIsn't that what you want us to
ttbelieve?  That we're completely
ttdefenseless?  That you know what's
ttbest?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttListen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very
ttcarefully.  I do know what's best.

ttAs we're sitting here the town or
ttthe school board or the manufacturer
ttof that bus are lining up a battery
ttof their own lawyers to negotiate
ttwith people as grief-stricken as
ttyourselves.  And this makes me very,
ttvery mad.  It's why I came all the
ttway up here.  If everyone had done
tttheir job with integrity your son
ttwould be alive this morning and
ttsafely in school.  I promise you
ttthat I will pursue and reveal who it
ttwas that did not do their job.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttWho is responsible for this tragedy.
ttThen, in your name and the Walkers'
ttname and the name of whoever decides
ttto join us, I shall sue.  I shall
ttsue for negligence until they bleed.

tPause.

<b>ttttWANDA
</b>ttI want that person to go to jail.
ttFor the rest of his life.  I want
tthim to die there.  I don't want his
ttmoney.
<b> 
</b>






tMITCHELL nods sympathetically.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttIt's unlikely that anyone will go to
ttprison, Mrs. Otto.  But he or his
ttcompany will pay in other ways.  And
ttwe must make them pay.  Not for the

ttmoney or to compensate you for the
ttloss of your son.  That can't be
ttdone.  But to protect other innocent
ttchildren.  You see, I'm not just
tthere to speak for your anger, but
ttfor the future as well.

ttWhat we're talking about is an

tPause.  HARTLEY looks at MITCHELL'S teacup.

tMITCHELL maintains his eye contact with WANDA.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttIf you agree to have me represent

</b>ttRats!
ttThey fought the dogs and killed the

ttAnd bit the babies in the cradles,
ttAnd ate the cheeses out of vats.
ttAnd licked the soup from the cook's
ttown ladles,
ttSplit open the kegs of salted
ttsprats,
ttMade nests inside men's Sunday hats,
ttAnd even spoiled the women's chats,
ttBy drowning their speaking

tThe three figures are seen from behind, trudging their way
tthrough the winter landscape.

tThis image has a ghostly quality to it.  It is filmed in

tSuddenly, a snowball enters the frame and hits LYDIA on the

tBILLY in his chair in Room 11 of the Bide-A-Wile.  He is
talone, smoking a cigarette.  A slight faraway smile on his
tlips.

tAfter a moment, the door opens.  It is RISA.

tThey stare at each other.  Silence.

<b>ttttRISA
</b>ttI knew you'd be here.

tRISA sits on the bed.  Pause.

<b>ttttRISA (CONT'D)
</b>ttAre you going to the funeral?

tPause.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttI stopped by the station a while

<b>ttttRISA
</b>ttSomething made this happen, Billy.
ttMr. Stephens is going to find out
ttwhat it was.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b><b> 
</b>





ttWhat are you talking about?  It was

<b>ttttRISA
</b>ttMr. Stephens says that someone
ttdidn't put a right bolt in the

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttRisa, I serviced that bus.  At the

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttYes.

</b>ttWhy did you do that, Billy?

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttYou think that caused the accident,

</b>

</b>ttYou know what I'm going to miss?

</b>
tMITCHELL is videotaping the bus with a portable camcorder.

tThe bus is badly damaged, though essentially intact.  Most
tof the windows in the rear have gone.  There is a ghostly
tquality to this image, as though the video light is
tsearching through the remains of an ancient shipwreck.

tMITCHELL turns off the camcorder and stands in the silent
tnight, absorbing the disturbing energy of the bus.  He hears
ta truck approaching the garage from the distance.  It's
tBILLY ANSEL.  MITCHELL retreats to his parked car as BILLY
tstops his truck in front of the bus and steps out of the
ttruck.

tBILLY leaves his headlights on, and they cast dark shadows
tover the inside passenger seats.  BILLY stares at the bus a
tlong time.  MITCHELL approaches him.

</b>ttI'm here about your children, Mr.

tBILLY looks at the card.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttMr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire,
ttwould you be likely to sue me if I

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttNo, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttLeave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the
ttpeople of this town alone.  You
ttcan't help.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttYou can help each other.  Several

ttYour case as an individual will be

ttyou together as a group.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttCase?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttThe Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos.
ttNicole Burnell's parents.  It's

ttright away.  Things get covered up.
ttPeople lie.  That's why we have to
ttbegin our investigation quickly.
ttBefore the evidence disappears.
ttThat's why I'm out here tonight.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttI know Risa and Wendell Walker.
ttThey wouldn't hire a goddamned

<b> 
</b>





ttwith you.  We're not country

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttYou're angry, Mr. Ansel.  You owe it
ttto yourself to feel that way.  All
ttI'm saying is let me direct your
ttrage.

tBILLY stares at MITCHELL with a cold intensity.  The cell
tphone in MITCHELL'S car begins to ring.

<b>ttttMITCHELL (CONT'D)
</b>ttThat's my daughter.  Or it may be
ttthe police to tell me that they've
ttfound her dead.  She's a drug
ttaddict.

<b>ttttBILLY
</b>ttWhy are you telling me this?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttI'm telling you this because...
ttwe've all lost our children, Mr.
ttAnsel.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttThey're dead to us.  They kill each

ttSomething terrible has happened
ttthat's taken our children away.
ttIt's too late.  They're gone.

tThe phone continues to ring, as BILLY stares at MITCHELL.

</b>
tMITCHELL is getting ready to leave.  DOLORES is still
tgrasping onto ABBOTT'S hand.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttI have a question for you, Mr.
ttStephens.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttWhat's that, Dolores?
<b> 
</b>





<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttI told you that I was doing fifty
ttmiles an hour when the accident
tthappened.  That's how I remembered
ttit.  But the truth is, I might have
ttbeen doing sixty.  Or sixty five.
ttAnd if that's true, that I was over
ttthe limit when the bus went over,
ttwhat would happen then?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttThat would complicate things.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttBecause I'd be to blame, right?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttBilly Ansel will insist that you
ttwere driving fifty-one miles an
tthour.  Just like you've done every
ttmorning for the past fifteen years.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttHe knows that?  Billy?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttYes.  He does.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttBilly said that?

tMITCHELL nods.

<b>ttttDOLORES (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou've talked to Billy?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttI did.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttAnd Billy told you that he'll tell
ttthat to...

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttMrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does
ttnot volunteer to say so in court, I
ttwill subpoena him and oblige him to
tttestify to that effect.

tPause.  MITCHELL plans his next step.

<b>ttttMITCHELL (CONT'D)
</b>ttBut in order to do that, you must
ttlet me bring a suit in your name
<b> 
</b>





ttcharging negligent infliction of
ttemotional harm.  That's what I'm now
ttasking you to consider.

tPause.  DOLORES is lost.

<b>ttttMITCHELL (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt's clear to me and other people
ttthat you have suffered significantly
ttfrom this event.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttWhat other people?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttWho's been talking to you about what
ttI'm feeling?  Who should care about
ttwhat I'm feeling?

tMITCHELL stares at DOLORES.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttDolores, people have to know that
ttyou've suffered too.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttAnd they won't understand until you
ttlet me clear your name - your good
ttname - once and for all.  Will you
ttlet me do that?  Will you let me do
ttmy duty?

tSuddenly, ABBOTT says something.  He twists his face around
this mouth, purses his lips on the left side and emits a
tstring of broken syllables and sounds.  After this outburst,
tDOLORES looks at MITCHELL, a comforted smile on her face.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttYou heard what Abbott said?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttAnything you didn't understand?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttThere might have been a word or two
ttthat slipped by.  Maybe you could
ttclarify it for me, just to be
ttabsolutely sure.
<b> 
</b>






<b>ttttDOLORES
</b>ttAbbott said that the true jury of a
ttperson's peers is the people of her
tttown.  Only they, the people who
tthave known her all her life, and not
tttwelve strangers, can decide her
ttguilt or innocence.  And if I have
ttcommitted a crime, then it's a crime
ttagainst them, so they are the ones
ttwho must decide my punishment.

tMITCHELL stares at ABBOTT, who stares back.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttThat's what he said, is it?

</b>ttYes.  Abbot understands these

tBut SAM then leads NICOLE into the special room he has built
tfor her.  It seems like another world.  Every detail has
tbeen lovingly attended to.  No expense has been spared to
tmake this room as attractive and inviting as possible.

tA room that a guilty, abusive father might dream up for his
tcrippled daughter.

</b>ttWell, Nicole, I've been wanting to

ttyou know, I'm the guy representing
ttyou and your mom and dad and some
ttother folks here in town.  We're
tttrying to generate some
ttcompensation, however meager, for
ttwhat you have suffered, and at the

ttthis never happens again.  You're
ttcentral to the case I'm trying to
ttbuild, Nicole.  But you'd probably

</b>ttI don't like thinking about the

</b>ttPeople can't help it, you know.
ttThey really can't.  When they see
ttyou in this wheelchair, knowing what
ttyour life was life eight months ago,
ttpeople are going to feel sorry for
ttyou.  There's no way around it,
ttNicole.  You and I just met, and

tSAM is carrying NICOLE up the stairs of the community
tcentre.

tThere is no ramp, so the wheelchair is left at the bottom.

tHe is having difficulty, because NICOLE is keeping her body
tstiff and won't hold on to him.

</b>
<b>tINT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY
</b>
tNICOLE is wheeled across the floor of the community centre
tto a table where the depositions are being made.  MITCHELL,
tSCHWARTZ, and the STENOGRAPHER are waiting for her.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>tttt(voice over)
ttThe last time I was in the community
tthall was for the big Christmas party
ttalmost a year ago.  It hadn't
ttchanged.

<b>ttttttt  CUT TO
</b>
<b>tINT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY
</b>
tThe deposition.  SAM watches his daughter as she speaks
tconfidently into the microphone.  The STENOGRAPHER takes
tnotes.

tNICOLE is answering questions from the opposing lawyer.
tMITCHELL is also taking notes.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttNow on that morning, did there come
tta time, Nicole, when you left your
ttparents' house?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttWhat time in the morning was this?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttAbout eight-thirty in the morning.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttWas anyone waiting for the bus with
ttyou?
<b> 
</b>






<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttNo.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny
ttwas sick and stayed home that day.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttWas there anything unusual about the
ttdriver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus
ttthat particular morning?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttLike what?  I mean, I don't remember
tta lot.

<b>tANGLE ON MITCHELL
</b>
<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttI object to the form of that
ttquestion.  Note that.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttWas the bus on time?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttAnd where did you sit that morning?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttMy usual place.  On the right side.
ttThe first seat.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttAnd according to your recollection,
ttthere was nothing unusual about the
ttdrive that morning?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttUntil the accident?  No.
tttt(beat)
ttYes, there was.

<b>tANGLE ON MITCHELL
</b>
tWorried about this new information.

<b>ttttNICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt was when Sean Walker got on.  He
ttwas crying and didn't want to leave
tthis mother.  Mason Ansel was sitting
ttbeside me.  I asked him to move, so
ttI could quiet Sean down.  When the
ttbus started up, a car came around
<b> 
</b>





ttthe corner and almost hit Sean's
ttmother.  She was okay, but it really
ttscared Sean, because he watched it
ttout the window.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttAnd was this incident caused in any
ttway by anything the driver of the
ttbus did?

tPause.  MITCHELL is nervous.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttNo, she hadn't even started to move
ttthe bus.  It was the car's fault.

tMITCHELL is relieved.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttThere was nothing reckless in Mrs.
ttDriscoll's behavior?

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttI object to that form of question.
ttNote that.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>tttt(answering the
ttttquestion)
ttNo.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttDid there come a time when all the
ttchildren had been picked up?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttYou remember that much?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttAs I'm talking, I'm remembering more
ttabout it.

tMITCHELL is worried.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttNote my objection.  She said, 'As
ttI'm talking.'

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttDid there come a time when the bus
ttturned off Staples Mill Road onto
<b> 
</b>





ttthe Marlowe Road at what's called
ttWilmot Springs?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttThere was a brown dog that ran
ttacross the road up there, right by
ttthe dump, and Dolores slowed down
ttnot to hit him, and he ran into the
ttwoods.  And then Dolores drove on
ttand turned onto the Marlowe road, as
ttusual.  I remember that.  I'm
ttremembering it pretty clearly.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>tttt(eyebrows raised)
ttYou are?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>tttt(worried)
ttNote that she said 'pretty clearly'.
ttNot 'clearly'.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttAnd what was the weather like at
ttthis time?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttIt was snowing.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttUnless the report from the National
ttWeather Bureau for the district on
ttJanuary 23 goes into the record, I
ttwill object to that question.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttI will offer that report.  Well,
ttthen, now that your memory seems to
ttbe clearing, can you tell us what
ttelse  you observed at that time?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttBefore the actual accident?

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttYes.

tNICOLE stares at her father as she responds.
<b> 
</b>






<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttI was scared.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttWhy were you scared?

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttThis is before the accident, Nicole.
ttDo you understand what I'm asking?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttYes, I understand.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttWhy were you scared?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttDolores was driving too fast.

tSilence.  MITCHELL is watching his entire case crumble.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttMrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast?
ttWhat made you think that, Nicole?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttThe speedometer.  And it was
ttdownhill there.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttYou could see the speedometer?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttYes.  I looked.  I remember clearly
ttnow.  It seemed we were going too
ttfast down the hill.  I was scared.

tNICOLE looks at MITCHELL, who stares back.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttHow fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll
ttwas going?  To the best of your
ttrecollection?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttSeventy-two miles an hour.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttSeventy-two miles an hour?  You're
ttsure of this?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttPositive.
<b> 
</b>






<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttYou believe that the bus driven by
ttMrs. Driscoll was going at seventy-
tttwo miles an hour at this time?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttI told you I was positive.  The
ttspeedometer was large and easy to
ttsee from where I was.

<b>tANGLE ON
</b>
tThe speedometer from NICOLE'S P.O.V.  It reads fifty-one
tmiles an hour.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>tttt(voice over)
ttYou saw the speedometer?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttDid you say anything to Mrs.
ttDriscoll?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttWhy not?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttI was scared.  And there wasn't
tttime.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttThere wasn't time?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttNo.  Because the bus went off the
ttroad.  And crashed.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttYou remember this?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttYes.  I do now.  Now that I'm
tttelling it.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>tttt(defeated)
<b> 
</b>





ttShe said, 'Now that I'm telling it'.
ttNote that.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttWhat do you remember about the
ttaccident?

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttI remember the bus swerved, it just
ttsuddenly swerved to the right, and
ttit hit the guardrail and the
ttsnowbank on the side of the road,
ttand then it went over the embankment
ttthere, and everyone was screaming
ttand everything.  And that's all.  I
ttguess I was unconscious after that.
ttThat's all.  Then I was in the
tthospital.

tSCHWARTZ smiles and makes some notes in his pad.  He talks
tto MITCHELL without looking up.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttDo you have any questions, Mr.
ttStephens?

tMITCHELL stares silently at NICOLE for a long time.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>tttt(voice over)
ttDaddy was leaning forward in his
ttchair, his mouth half open, as if he
ttwanted to say something.  Like what,
ttDaddy?  Like 'What about my money?'

tNICOLE and SAM stare at each other.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttI have no questions.

<b>ttttSCHWARTZ
</b>ttThank you, Nicole.

tNICOLE wheels herself away.  She passes MITCHELL.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>tttt(in a low voice)
ttYou'd make a great poker player,
ttkid.

tNICOLE wheels herself over to her father.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttLet's go, Daddy.

<b>tEXT. COMMUNITY CENTRE -- DAY
</b>
tNICOLE is in the car in front of the community centre.  She
tstares at SAM as he argues with MITCHELL on the steps.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>tttt(voice over)
ttDaddy took a long time.  I guess he
ttwanted to have a few words with you.
ttHe must have tried to tell you that
ttI was lying.  Then you would tell
ttDaddy that it didn't matter if I was
ttlying or not, the lawsuit is dead.

tAs NICOLE'S words are heard, her point of view of SAM and
tMITCHELL arguing is seen.

tThe movement of their lips is in sync with NICOLE'S voice
tover.

<b>ttttNICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>tttt(voice over)
ttEveryone's lawsuit is dead.  Forget
ttit.  Tell the others to forget it.
ttIt's over.  Right now, Sam, the
ttthing you've got to worry about is
ttwhy she lied.  A kid who'd do that
ttto her own father is not normal,
ttSam.

tSAM comes down the stairs and enters the car, sitting down
tat the driver's seat.  NICOLE stares at him as he starts the
tcar.

<b>ttttNICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>tttt(voice over)
ttBut Daddy knows who lied.  He knows
ttwho the liar is.  He knows who's
ttnormal.

tSAM stares ahead, not knowing what to do next.

<b>ttttNICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>tttt(speaking to SAM)
ttI hope he lets us keep the computer.

tSAM turns to look at NICOLE.

<b>ttttNICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>ttI'd like an ice cream.

</b>
tMITCHELL is at the baggage section of the arrival area,
twaiting for his luggage.

tHe watches PETER, the man he met in the washroom changing
this daughter, playing with the little girl.

tPETER is full of love as he swings the little girl into the
tair as she laughs.

tMITCHELL is caught in a daydream, smiling at the happy image
tof father and daughter.  ALISON approaches him.

<b>ttttALISON
</b>ttWell, it was nice meeting you again,
ttMr. Stephens.

<b>ttttMITCHELL
</b>ttMitchell.  It was nice to see you

<b>ttttttt  CUT TO
</b>
<b>tEXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY
</b>
tSAM wheels NICOLE along a path away from the same concession
tstand that was seen at the beginning of the film.  NICOLE is
tlicking an ice-cream cone.  Around them, people are setting
tup the bandstand.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttDaddy, can we come to the fair?
<b> 
</b>





<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttHow about Sunday night?  That's
ttalways the best time.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttOkay.

tNICOLE looks at a team of men constructing a ride.  A school
tbus pulls up, and a group of children spill out.  NICOLE
twatches as the driver tries to form them into a group.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttWhat's going to happen to Dolores?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttWill the police do anything to her?

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttIt's too late for that.  She can't
ttdrive the bus anymore.  The school
ttboard saw to that right off.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttShe'll move away.

<b>ttttSAM
</b>ttThere's talk of that.

<b>ttttNICOLE
</b>ttSomeplace where no one knows her.

tAcross the road, a hotel minibus is parked.  The driver is

tMITCHELL catches her gaze, and the two stare at each other.

tslowly turning wheel are full of children.  The laughter and
tnoise is haunting.
