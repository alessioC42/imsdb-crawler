<b>tA BLACK SCREEN:
</b>
tVarious voices:t  "Big six"... "That's six the hard way"...
ttt  "Seven or eleven"... "Play two"...

<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT.  UPPER EAST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
</b>
tOne of the pristine blocks of brownstones where even the
tgarbage seems gift wrapped.  The VOICES continue over as
twe move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is
tholding open the door for a dowager and her poodle.

tThe voices continue:  "Hit me"... "Double down"... "Let it
tride"... "Hit me"... "Anymore for the come out"...
t"Card"...

tIn contrast to the outside of this sedate, quiet
tbrownstone, we go inside to find...


<b>tINT.  BROWNSTONE APARTMENT
</b>
t... a miniature Las Vegas, complete with music, drinks,
ttuxedoed dealers and croupiers:  roulette, craps, Black
tJack.  Wall to wall people.  The fact that casino gambling
thappens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these
tConnecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior
twiseguys from having a good time.

<b>tAT THE CARD TABLE
</b>
tNICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a
twinning hand.  In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of
tquiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate.
tHis Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled
tshirt, out of date; Nick could care less.

tTwo other players are still in the game.  One of them is a
tlithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling
tfriends and tuxedoed men.  The pot is huge.

tNick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttOne, and one on top.

<b>tttttDEALER
</b>tttHouse sees.

<b>tttttPLAYER ONE
</b>tttt(hesitates)
tttI'm out.

tDisgusted, he throws down his cards.

tIt's down to Nick and the debutante.  The cocky deb gives
tNick a long look, confident she can win.

<b>tttttDEBUTANTE
</b>tttt(her eyes still on
tttt Nick)
tttI see the deuce, and one to chase
tttthem home.

tShe throws her chips on the pot.  Nick hesitates, then
tdecides to match it.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttCall.

<b>tttttDEBUTANTE
</b>tttt(showing her hand)
tttLadies, aces wired.  Sorry sport.

tNick turns over his cards, Jacks and tens, not good enough
tto win.  Elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins
ther giggling friends.  Nick walks over to her.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttVery nice, Barbie.
tttt(pointing toward her
tttt boyfriend)
tttNow, I'd take Ken over there and go
ttthome.

<b>tttttDEBUTANTE
</b>tttWhy's that?

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttIt's time.  That's all.

<b>tttttBOYFRIEND
</b>tttThe lady wants to play.  Someone
tttshould teach you to be a better
tttloser, loser.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttListen, Ken --

<b>tttttBOYFRIEND
</b>tttMy name is not Ken --

<b>tttttNICK
</b>ttt-- I'm offering you the benefit of
tttmy experience.

<b>tttttDEBUTANTE
</b>tttLooks like you have a lot of
tttexperience in places like this.  It
tttwas nice of them to relax the dress
tttcode for you.

tThat draws a laugh from her friends.  The entourage heads
tfor the bar.

tCHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the
tdebutante, blocking her path.

tShe steps to the side.  Charlie steps with her.  Charlie's
tpushing it, he's always pushing it.  She's not amused.
tFinally, Charlie lets her pass.  He comes up to Nick.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttTypical New York woman, big
tttattitude, small apartment, no tits.

tOnly two things count to Charlie:  his job and his women,
tbut not necessarily in that order.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttI think she got to you, pappy.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttt(checking his watch)
tttYou want a popsicle, go to Good
tttHumor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttt(glancing at the
tttt door)
tttStill, you gotta wonder how she'd
tttlook in handcuffs.

tNick, wary, eyes this kid.  Charlie shrugs, spreads his
tarms defensively.  The SOUND of pounding on the front
tdoor.

<b>tTHE DOOR
</b>
tsplinters.  The bouncer steps back as four helmeted
temergency service officers -- the first members of the
traiding party -- rush in.

tPandemonium.  People rush for the exit -- any exit.

<b>tAT THE BAR
</b>
tNick and Charlie hold up their glasses.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttt(calmly)
tttAlley oop.

tThey down their drinks, then set them down.

tCharlie pulls out the Binaca, offering Nick a spritz, but
tNick is already pulling out his POLICE BADGE and hanging
tit around his neck.  Charlie quickly follows suit.

<b>tA HALF DOZEN COPS
</b>
tline the patrons up against the wall.  The Asst. D.A.,
tPATTY ZACHARA, climbs onto the crap table.  A petite,
tnervous woman, Patty has dressed in a Channel suit for the
toccasion.

<b>tttttZACHARA
</b>tttSettle down.  Hey, quiet... Please.

tNot a prayer.

<b>tttttNICK
</b><b>tttSHUT THE HELL UP, GODDAMNIT!
</b>
tThat quiets them.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttMy name is Conklin.  Let's do this
tttfast so I can go home.

tZachara, annoyed, looks at Nick.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttt(softer)
tttIt's all yours.

<b>tttttZACHARA
</b>tttt(reads)
tttUnder section 216 of the New York
tttState Penal code, I serve notice
tttthat this premise and it's
tttoccupants...

<b>tNICK
</b>
tcatches the Debutante's eye across the room.  She smiles
tat him, he was right.  He shrugs, spreads his hands.
tThat's life.

tA well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as
tCAVELLO, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against
tthe wall.

tCharlie spins around to stop him --

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttWhoa -- where do you think you're
tttgoing, hotdog.

tCavello butts him with his head, sending Charlie to the
tfloor.  Then, crosses his arms in front of his face and
tplunges through the WINDOW.

tNick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he
tfollows.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttt(sighs)
tttFabulous...

tHe takes off after him.


<b>tEXT.  STREET UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT
</b>
tNick, short of breath, chases Cavello down the residential
tstreet, past the dog-walkers, past the doormen, past the
tfur-coated women climbing out of taxies... Unfortunately,
tCavello has a good half block on him.

tFrom nowhere, Charlie blasts past leaving Nick a half
tblock behind, silently cursing his age.

<b>tAT THE CORNER
</b>
ta limo jerks to a halt, and Cavello jumps in.  The limo
tstreaks away.

<b>tCHARLIE
</b>
tturns to see Nick, hands on knees, gasping for air.

<b>tttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT.  LOCKER ROOM - TWO EIGHT PRECINCT - NIGHT
</b>
tNow in their street clothes, Charlie and Nick stand in
tfront of the mirrors.  Charlie is working his brush and
thair dryer as if his life depended on it.  Nick, in
tcontrast, shoves his hair back with his fingers and
tglowers at himself in the mirror.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttt(over the dryer)
ttt... It's not like you were slow or
tttanything... I think you did just
tttfine.  I think you did great.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttThanks.

tNick turns to leave.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttHey, hey, where you goin'?

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttHome.


<b>tEXT.  POLICE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
tNick strides out the door.  Charlie hurries after him.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttWait up.  You know the guy who did
tttthe Weismuller through the window --

<b>tttttNICK
</b>ttt-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.

tCharlie trails Nick to his motorcycle:  a Harley hog
tcomplete with wide gleaming fenders and twin tanks.  The
tbike is held together with tape and baling wire.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttYou know him?

tNick tries to kick-start this behemoth, but it's not easy.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttHe works for Frank Abolofia.
tttAtlantic City.  Casinos.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttSo why dive through the glass for a
tttnickel and dime bust?

tCharlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe.
tNick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's
tsock, grabs Charlie's foot.  Charlie teeters.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttWhat's this?

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttLet go...

tNick pulls out a Beretta 32.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttBack-up.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttGet rid of it.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttWhy?

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttIt's not regulation.  And the only
tttway you're gonna stop anybody with
tttit is to show it to him, and while
ttthe's laughing, you can shove it down
ttthis throat.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttt(looking at Nick's
tttt bike)
tttI'll get rid of it when you get rid
tttof the egg-beater.

tThe Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke.
tNick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some
tski goggles.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttNick, let's go hunting.  Bag
tttCavello.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttCharlie...

tNick pops the bike into gear.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>ttt... You still got shaving cream on
tttyour ear.

tNick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke.


<b>tEXT.  BELT PARKWAY - VERRAZANO BRIDGE - NIGHT
</b>
tWE FIND Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out
tof the lights and shadows.  The SOUND of wind whips
tthrough his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... The tail
tlights of Nick's bike disappear into the night.


<b>tEXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT
</b>
tCivil service heaven.  Nick hits the cut switch and glides
tpast the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this
tdevelopment.  A basketball net in every driveway, a Buick
tor Chrysler in every garage.

tOne house sticks out.  The lawn is brown, paint is peeling
toff the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the
tdriveway.  Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking
tat the house.  His house.  It's as inviting as an open
tgrave.  He shoots away.


<b>tINT.  EL GRECO DINER - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT
</b>
tA hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet.

tNick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the
tDaily News in front of him.  A NURSE walks in and sits
tdown a half dozen seats away.  Nick look up.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttShort shift?

<b>tttttCONNIE
</b>tttYeah... I came to save you.  If
tttyou're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.

<b>tttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tNick and Connie are in bed.  They're both looking up at
tthe ceiling.  They've just made love.

<b>tttttCONNIE
</b>tttIt's getting too cold even for me,
tttNick.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttConnie...

<b>tttttCONNIE
</b>tttAll right, how's the new partner?

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttHigh spirits, desire, commitment.

<b>tttttCONNIE
</b>tttYou'll take care of that.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttGive me a break, would you?

<b>tttttCONNIE
</b>tttIf you give me one.

tNick kisses her.  The first suggestion of real affection.
tThe SOUND of someone KNOCKING on the door.  Reluctantly,
tthey stop.  Connie gets up and puts on her robe.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttAre you expecting anyone?

<b>tttttCONNIE
</b>tttI wasn't expecting you.

tShe disappears down the hallway.  We HEAR the door open,
tthen telling someone to wait.

<b>tttttCONNIE
</b>tttt(poking her head in
tttt the room)
tttImagine a small, greasy Boy Scout.

<b>tttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT
</b>
tNick, wearing only his pants, is doing a slow burn.
tCharlie is holding his hands up defensively.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt... I found the goombah... Cavello.
tttHe's --

<b>tttttNICK
</b>ttt-- I should tear your head off.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttWhoa, I knew you were going to say
tttthat.  I absolutely anticipated
tttthat, Nick.  But I said to myself,
tttCharlie, Charlie, we can move up on
tttthis, so go find Nicklaus... He'll
tttbe pissed for a moment, but then
tttit'll dawn on him --

<b>tttttNICK
</b>ttt-- Hey, I got a better chance of
tttbeing hit by a bus then moving up.

tCharlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide.  He
tknows he's on sensitive ground.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt... Look... they told me at the
tttGreek's you were here.  I'm sorry, I
tttnever imagined...

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttt(buddy buddy)
tttI like her.  She's nice.
tttt(lowering his voice)
tttFor her age.

tThe bedroom door opens.  Connie enters, dumps Nick's
tclothes on the couch, tosses his gun on top of the pile.
tWithout a word, she goes back inside and slams the door
tbehind her.

tNick, pissed, slowly turns to face Charlie.  Charlie
tshrugs.  Nick's got nothing better to do than go.

<b>tttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT.  LIME HOUSE - CHINATOWN - NIGHT
</b>
tThe Lime House is a little piece of Italy in the heart of
tChinatown, and tonight, it's packed.  Any selection on the
tjukebox that isn't Frank Sinatra is Jerry Vale.  Behind
tthe bar are two fat BROTHERS.  One pours drinks, the other
tdishes out Scungilli.  It's three a.m.  It's always three
ta.m. at the Lime House.

<b>tAT THE BACK TABLE
</b>
tOur man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an
talready heaping plate in front of an imperious looking
tJAPANESE MAN.  The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears
ta gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out
tof place.

tA Japanese TRANSLATOR, doing his best to translate
tCavello's heavily accented English, sits between them.

<b>tAT THE BAR
</b>
tCharlie is looking straight ahead, afraid Cavello might
tpeg him.  Nick is at ease.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttWhat are they doing now?

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttEating Scungilli, just like the last
ttttime you asked.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttWho do you think the Jap is?

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttMaybe Cavello's buying a Subaru.
tttHow would I know?

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttI don't blame you for being sore.
tttIt'll pass when we bag him.

tCharlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttWhatdaya think?  'Bostonians'.
tttEighty-five bucks.
tttt(lowering his voice)
tttGirls go for shoes.  Second place
tttthey look.
tttt(off Nick's
tttt reaction)
tttHey, I read it in a magazine.

tNick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttt(dead serious)
tttCharlie, don't do anything.  Promise
tttme?

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttWhat?

tWHAT THEY SEE:  TWO BODYGUARDS are making a quick sweep of
tthe bar.  FRANK ABOLOFIA, s stocky man with silver grey
thair, sweeps in behind them.  Abolofia has mitts like a
tmeat packer and a fifty dollar manicure.  A heavyweight
tMafioso.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttFrank Abolofia.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttThe Wolf?

tAbolofia walks to Cavello's table.  All rise and shake
thands.  The two hitters take seats at the bar.  The two
tbrothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttt(in a whisper)
tttSome party.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttMaybe we should do something?

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttCharlie, take your gum, stick it
tttunder your ass and keep it warm.

tNick turns away, resumes his drink.

tNICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR:  two new Japanese
tmen step in the door.  Early twenties, spiky hair, dark
tVersace suits.

<b>tNUMBER ONE
</b>
twears tortoise shell shades.  He coolly checks out the
troom then nods to --

<b>tNUMBER TWO
</b>
twho pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his
tcoat, and spits out three rounds.  A window shatters.
tEveryone hits the floor.

<b>tNUMBER ONE
</b>
tslowly walks toward Cavello's table.

<b>tNUMBER TWO
</b>
tcovers the floor.  Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty
thands.

<b>tNICK AND CHARLIE
</b>
ton the floor.  They don't have the artillery for this guy
teither.

<b>tAT THE TABLE
</b>
tOur Japanese businessman knows these people.  He eyes them
tcontemptuously.

tAbolofia has put enough people in this situation to be
tphilosophical about it.  He stops chewing.  A tiny
thand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any
tprecipitous action.

<b>tttttNUMBER ONE
</b>tttt(in Japanese)
tttGive it to me.

tThe Japanese businessman looking straight ahead.  A long,
tsilent pause... Then, still not facing him:

<b>tttttBUSINESSMAN
</b>tttt(in Japanese)
tttGo to hell.

tNumber One slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging
this eyes.  IN A FLASH, he pulls a shuto from under his
tcoat.  The 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube.

tHe presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's
tthroat.

<b>tCHARLIE
</b>
this hand close around the grip of the Beretta.  He unsnaps
tthe ankle holster.  The SNAP can be heard across the room.
tNick's hand closes around Charlie's and squeezes till the
tknuckles turn white.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttt(in a whisper)
tttWhat are you doing?

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttSaving your life.

<b>tNUMBER TWO
</b>
tlevels the scattergun at Nick and Charlie.

<b>tAT THE TABLE - NUMBER ONE
</b>
tcalmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches
tinto the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular,
tplastic-wrapped parcel.

tHe feels its weight, then flips it to NUMBER TWO.

tAbolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't
taffect him or his, resumes eating.

<b>tttttABOLOFIA
</b>tttYou people are wild... Wild.

tNUMBER ONE backs the blade off.  The man raises his napkin
tto the small wound.  A droplet of blood has stained his
tshirt collar.  NUMBER ONE turns around as if to leave.

tWhat happens next could be a whim, an after thought.
tNumber One spins around and THRUSTS the blade deep into
tthe man's chest.  He withdraws it with a half twist, and
tin the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat
tbefore the old man's body hits the floor.

tBlood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his
tScungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the
tfloor.

<b>tCAVELLO
</b>
treaches for a gun under his coat.  But NUMBER TWO pumps
ttwo rounds into his face.  At this range, there's not much
tleft.

tThe killers slowly back out the door, covering the room
twith the scattergun.  The minute the door shuts, Nick
tleaps up, pulling his shield and revolver.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttt(shouting)
tttPolice officers.  Everybody stay
tttput.
tttt(to Charlie)
tttGet back up.

tAbolofia's eyebrows rise at this development.

tNick bolts out the door leaving Charlie in charge.  He's
tnever been in charge before.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttt(nervously showing
tttt shield)
tttPolice.


<b>tEXT.  THE LIME HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tA Lincoln tears around the corner to pick the killers up.

tNick flies out the Lime House door and hits the ground.

tNumber Two pumps out shells as fast as he can squeeze the
ttrigger.  He's wild.  The front windows of the Lime House
tshatter.

tThe LIMO DRIVER jerks to a halt.  Number Two tosses the
tpackage to him.

tNick empties his revolver.  Number Two goes down.

tThe driver floors the accelerator, leaving Number One to
ttake off on foot.  Nick follows, reloading as he runs.


<b>tINT.  THE LIME HOUSE
</b>
tEveryone's frozen on the floor.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttCall 911.  Tell them an officer
tttneeds assistance.  Say ten thirteen.

tNothing from the owner who looks at Abolofia.  Charlie
tgrabs the owner by his collar and shoves him toward the
tphone.

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttDo it, you dumb bastard!

tSuddenly Charlie feels something wet at his feet.  He
tlooks down to see that he's standing in a pool of blood
tfrom the massacre.  So much for his new shoes.

tHe wheels around, then quickly backs out the door.


<b>tEXT.  STREET - DOWN THE BLOCK FROM THE LIME HOUSE
</b>
tDeserted.  The wail of police sirens in the distance.
tCharlie has his gun out.  He's drenched in sweat.  Where
tis his partner?

<b>tttttCHARLIE
</b>tttNICK...!  Shit... SHIT!!

<b>tttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tANOTHER STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
tNick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley:
tit's the ad hoc drugstore for the night.  Drugs going up
tand down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting,
tslumped on the ground.  Everyone scatters -- the one's
tthat can.

<b>tAN ABANDONED PAIL
</b>
tswings slowly back and forth from three stories up.  Nick
tcautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both
thands.  A Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his
tgun and nearly blows him away.

<b>tNUMBER ONE
</b>
tWe see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at
tthe back of the alley.  From now on we'll call him KOBO.
tHis sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped
tcasually at his side.  A very cool character.

tKobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his
tfinger, slowly points and "shoots" at Nick... He lowers
this hand.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttOn the ground, man.  NOW!!

tKobo cups his hands around his ear.  He doesn't understand
tEnglish.  Nick, keeping his gun fixed, comes up to him and
tkicks out his legs.

tKobo falls flat on his chest.

tNick pulls out his cuffs.  But Kobo lunges for Nick's
tankle and yanks it toward him.  Nick stumbles backward;
tKobo's on his feet.  Before Nick can stand, Kobo lands a
tbrutal kick to the side of Nick's head.

tNick gets up, barrels into him.  Kobo knees Nick in the
tsolar plexus, then lands two more well placed kicks in
tNick's back.  It's not that Nick's a bad fighter, it's
tthat this kid is so damn fast.

tNick slowly gets to his feet.  KOBO lands two more brutal
tshots to the side of Nick's head.  He's a bloody mess.

<b>tTWO POLICE CARS
</b>
tstop at the end of the alley.  FOUR OFFICERS climb out.

<b>tCHARLIE
</b>
tjoins the cops as they run down the alley to find Nick
tgetting pummeled.

tCharlie shoots at Kobo.  Misses.  Kobo turns to see the
tfive cops, guns drawn.

tNick, on one knee, spits out blood and a few teeth.

tKobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and
tdrops it next to Nick.  The blade gleams in the light.
tThat was next.  Nick got lucky.

tKobo towers imperiously above Nick.  Their eyes lock.  We
thold then...

<b>tttttttt FADE TO BLACK.
</b>
<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tNICK'S LIVING ROOM - STATEN ISLAND - MORNING
</b>
tThere isn't a stick of furniture, but that's not the half
tof it.  In the middle of the room is a motorcycle on a
tcenterstand.  A drop cloth is spread around it, tools

tNick pulls out his handcuffs.  Charlie can't figure out

tAnd tattoos...

tThey head straight for Nick and Charlie, then, at the last

tTHE HEAD is resting in the middle of a conveyer belt.
tIt's been drenched in black printer's ink which has begun

tWE SLOWLY TRACK PAST Ich, Charlie, and Nick, watching.
tCharlie has the dry heaves.

tREAL SOUND as we reveal the full crime scene.  Instead of
tthe usual cigar smoke, camera flashes and radio chatter,
tthere is order and quiet.  A slow underwater dance.

<b>tINSPECTOR OHASHI
</b>
tquietly gives an order.  Someone turns off the robotic.
tThe severed legs stop swinging.

tNick, Charlie and Ich walk over to Ohashi.  Ich bows

</b>tttThere's a war, detective, between

tclimb off their bikes and follow.

tfrom the recent humiliation.

tthis wide-eyed goofy kid.

tSomething makes Nick's smile fade.

<b>tNICK'S POV
</b>
tKOBO, their escaped prisoner, hurrying in the opposite

<b>tttttNICK

tCharlie spots him.  In a flash, the two men jump the
trailing and charge after him, leaving Ich in their wake.

tIch can't possibly make it over the side.  He furiously
tshoves his way through the Salarymen, trying to get to the
tend of the walkway.

<b>tCHASE SEQUENCE

t-- Nick barreling through the mass of faceless Salarymen.

t-- Kobo, hurrying ahead, occasionally glancing back.

t-- Charlie catching up to Nick.  They've lost him.  They
t   spin around.  A half dozen tunnels spin out in all
t   directions.

t-- Nick and Charlie spotting Kobo.  He's waiting for them
t   near the turnstile.

tNick suddenly realizes it's a set-up.  Before he can say
tanything, Charlie sprints ahead, recklessly shoving
tpeople out of the way.

tttIt's a set-up...!  Charlie!

tCharlie hasn't heard him.

<b>tAT THE TURNSTILE
</b>
tKobo hands a ticket to the turnstile guard and disappears
tonto the platform.  Charlie doesn't have a ticket.  The
tguard points to the automatic ticket machine.  Screw it.
tCharlie leaps over the turnstile.

tThe GUARD blows his shrill whistle to signal the subway
tpolice.

</b>
tCharlie pushes through the crowd -- a wall of blank faces.
tKobo is gone.

</b>
tshoving through the crowd.  He spots Charlie.  Shouts at

<b>tTHE SUBWAY
</b>
tpulls in.  An immaculately uniformed CONDUCTOR blows his
twhistle and waves his white-gloved hands to keep the crowd
tback.

tA LEATHER JACKETED BOY shoves Charlie from behind; he
tstumbles forward toward the track.  Someone catches him at
tthe last moment.  Charlie turns around to see it's Kobo.

tKobo smiles, it's all a big joke.

tWhat follows happens in a flash:

</b>
<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttCharlie!

tNick is close enough to see, too far to do anything.  He's
tblocked by TWO MORE LEATHER BOYS.  He tries to shove past,
tbut they grab him.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
tholding Charlie by his coat lapels.  An express train
ttears into the station.  Kobo casually glances at

<b>tNICK
</b>
ttrying to struggle free.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
this eyes still on Nick, drops Charlie in front of the

tThe train barrels through the station.

tKobo starts toward Nick.  He's next.

tA pair of SUBWAY POLICEMEN burst through the crowd
tsearching for Charlie because he vaulted the turnstile.

tThey flee into the crowd as the police close in.

<b>tACROSS THE PLATFORM - KOBO
</b>
tslips into the wave of commuters being shoved into a
ttrain by white-gloved MEN.  It's their job to shove
tcommuters into the already packed cars.

tNick goes for Kobo, but the crowd closes in front of him.
tHe can't get through.

<b>tTHE SUBWAY DOORS
</b>
tslam shut.  The train pulls out leaving Nick standing on
tthe empty platform.

tin New York.

</b>ttt... But you can take care of
tttyourself.  You're 'the biggest thing
tttto hit this town since Godzilla.'

tNick glances at the guards, then back at Kobo.  He is
tunarmed.  To make a move would be suicide.  More POLICE
tSIRENS in the b.g. closing in.

</b>tttWhat's the matter.  I'm right in

tttt(takes a step closer)

tThe car pulls away.

tNick gets up and goes to the closet.  He slides open the

thung up.

tHe shoves Charlie's jacket aside.  Something's wrong with
tthe way it hangs.  He pulls the jacket out, runs his hand
tover the coat, feeling something heavy in the lining.

tNick, smoking, is in a semi-sprawl; using his tea cup as

tThe furnishings are minimal but elegant.  There's a
tbutsudan, a tokonoma, and a low, long table in the middle
tof the room.  No chairs.  Nick sits on the floor.

tA door slides open at the far end of the room.  Sugai,
twearing a kimono over western style suit, walks in.  Nick
tstands up to shake his hand.  Sugai ignores it, and sits
tin the traditional position:  feet tucked beneath him.

<b>tttttSUGAI
</b>tttI'll spare you the ritual.

tHe tosses him a palm sized bundle.  Nick catches it.
tInside, are brand new greenbacks:  hundreds.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttThis supposed to impress me?

tHe sets it down.

<b>tttttSUGAI
</b>tttPick it up.  Look at it.

tNick hesitates, then picks it up again.  He runs his
tfingers over the face of the bill and snaps the paper.

<b>tttttSUGAI
</b>tttSeven years work by the finest

tttat the printing plant.

tSugai fills a cup of tea for Nick and hands it to him.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttI don't drink tea.

tSugai hands it to him anyway.

<b>tttttSUGAI
</b>tttI took Kobo from the street.  I gave

tttHe was supposed to take over this

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttI want him.

<b>tttttSUGAI
</b>tttHe'll be dealt with.

tSugai sets a plastic wrapped object on a table before
tNick.  Nick recognizes it from the restaurant massacre in
tNew York.

tCLOSE UP:  Nick's fingers tear at the plastic.  A block of
tblack iridescent polymer.  The negative image of a $100.00
tbill.  A printing plate.

tSugai takes the plate back.

tNick looks at a child playing near one of the hot pools in
tSugai's garden.

tSugai's ear.  If nick gets shot, so does Sugai.

tA handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is

tSugai coming, and immediately pull their guns.

tA couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room.

tThe door burst open.  Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in

tThe door, what's left of it, is kicked open.  The six men
tstep in, shooting in all directions:  into the bathroom

ttotal destruction.  They stop.  SILENCE.

tKobo walks up to Sugai who is slumped on the couch.  He

<b>tSUGAI
</b>
twearing a western suit, is asking Kobo questions in
tJapanese.  Sugai barks at him again.  Kobo refuses to
tanswer.  Sugai pulls up a shuto -- an 18 inch knife --
tfrom it's scabbard.

tThe guards walk over and turn Kobo around.  His back is to
tSugai.  Sugai runs the sword across the nape of Kobo's
tneck drawing blood.  The guards tighten their grip on
tKobo's arms.

<b>tNICK
</b>
tcan't believe Sugai's going to kill him.  Nick starts to

tKobo is led back into the room by two guards.  The guards
tshove him down to the floor.  His hands are still bound.

tNick walks over and stands above him.  He doesn't say a
tword.  Just stands above him.  Then, Nick pulls spare
tchange from his pocket and slowly drops the coins, one by
tone, in front of Kobo's face, like Kobo did to him.  He
twalks away.

tSugai steps in.

</b>tttAbolofia's person has received the

tA door opens at the far end of the room.  It's Kobo's

tShe starts toward Kobo; a lieutenant intercepts her.

tttYou're too old...

tttThat's enough.

tSugai turns away and picks up the sword.  The guards
tclutch Kobo.  Sugai's going to kill Kobo after all.

tThe girl screams at him to stop.  Sugai's oblivious.

<b>tttttNICK (O.S.)
</b>tttThat wasn't our deal.

</b>tttYou want him dead too.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttAfter a court convicts him.  He
tttbelongs to me.

tThere's a long pause.  Then, something unusual happens.
tSugai tells the lieutenant to unfasten Kobo's wrist.  When
the does, Sugai hands Kobo the sword and demands that he
tcut off his finger.

tThis is Yubitsume:  the ritual act within the Yakuza of
tslicing the joint of the little finger to atone for a
tmistake.

tKobo, not believing in this ancient tradition, refuses.
tSugai nods to a guard who places Kobo's finger on the
ttable.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
tstares defiantly at Sugai.  He doesn't even wince as the
tblade slices off his finger.  The guard hands Sugai the
tfinger in a handkerchief.

tKobo looks out the window at the people working the rice

ttheir identical suits, then at the women separated from

tA raucous SALARYMAN comes down the aisle, singing an Enka,
tswaying with the train, bumping into seats.  A common
tenough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers.
tThe Salaryman stumbles and falls across Nick's lap.

<b>tttttNICK

tttHey, hey, come on, blow...

tThe Salaryman bows deep.  Nick ignores it.  The man moves

tttThis is my stop.

tNick looks down the car.  The drunk Salaryman who stumbled
tover Nick is quite sober.  He made the hand-off to Kobo.
tKobo holds out his wrists.  Nick hesitates.

tKobo gets up, starts down the aisle.

tKobo's going to escape.

<b>tSUDDENLY
</b>
tNick, bent low, shoots past the cop car.  His left arm is
tscraped and bloody.

<b>tON KOBO
</b>
tglancing back, to see Nick gaining on him.  Kobo's
tpleased.  He gives it more gas.

<b>tNICK
</b>
tpulling eight-five... ninety... one hundred.  The rain
tstings his face.  It's hard to keep his eye open.

<b>tTHE FOOTHILLS
</b>
tKobo leaning into one of the steep turns, climbing higher
tand higher toward the clouds clinging to the top of the
tpeak.

<b>tNICK
</b>
tis gaining on him.  He HEARS something coming up behind
thim.

<b>tA BOSOZOKU
</b>
tthe one Ich shot in the leg, is closing fast on his tail.

<b>tON NICK
</b>
tas the biker draws even.

<b>tTHE BIKER
</b>
tpulls out his long knife and slashes at Nick's shoulder.

tNick drops back causing him to miss.  The biker drops
tback.  Nick tries to speed up, but the biker sticks with
thim.  He's a good rider, this boy.  Very, very good.

tThe biker moves in again, blade drawn.

<b>tNICK SEES
</b>
tsomething the biker doesn't.

<b>tA TRUCK
</b>
tcoming around the corner.

<b>tNICK
</b>
tswerves to avoid it at the last moment.  The biker reacts
ttoo late and runs --

<b>tINTO THE GLEAMING
</b>
tradiator of the two ton truck, and disappears beneath its
twheels.

<b>tON KOBO
</b>
taround the bend, glancing back.  Empty road.  He eases up
ton the throttle -- a free man... He circles back only to
tsee

<b>tNICK
</b>
tburst around the corner charging toward him at a hundred-
tand-twenty miles per hour, in the driving rain.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
twaits and waits.  Nick draws closer.  Then, Kobo tears off
tback down the mountain, shooting past Nick.

tNick brakes... He slows down, and starts to turn, but the
twheels whirl on the gravel and the bike goes into a skid,
theading right for the edge of the road.

<b>tttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tNICK'S MOTORCYCLE
</b>
tflying over the edge of the road, and down the cliff.

<b>tttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE EDGE OF THE ROAD
</b>
tNick, lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff, his
tarm is probably broken.

tHe tries to get up with a one arm push up.  It's hopeless.
tHis head falls into a puddle of water.

tThe WHINE of an approaching motorcycle.  Kobo has come
tback for him.

tNick, in excruciating pain, struggles for his gun.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
tbearing down on Nick.

<b>tNICK
</b>
tstruggling to get his gun.  Finally he does.  But it's
tcaked in mud.  If the barrel is stuffed it will explode.
tNick has to take the chance.

<b>tON KOBO
</b>
tCloser and closer.

<b>tNICK
</b>
taims as best he can and fires.  The mud caked gun explodes
tin his hand.  Nick screams in agony.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
tpulls his bike up inches in front of Nick's head.  Nick
tseems to be bleeding everywhere:  his hand, his nose, his
tmouth, the side of his head...

tKobo's face and neck is caked in blood from when Nick beat
thim.

tThe rain pours down.

tHe picks up the gun.  Points it at Nick, squeezes the
ttrigger.

<b>tttttKOBO
</b>tttt(slowly)
tttBang... bang...

tHe tosses the gun in front of Nick's face.

<b>tttttKOBO
</b>ttt... You're dead.

tThe sound of approaching Police SIRENS.

tKobo swings the bike around, goes a hundred yards down the
troad, then swings back.

tKobo guns the engine.  He gain speed... thirty, thirty-
tfive.

<b>tNICK
</b>
tstruggles to get up.  He can't.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
topening the throttle.

<b>tNICK
</b>
tcrawling a few inches, that's it.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
ttwenty yards away.

<b>tNICK
</b>
treaches into his coat and pulls Ich's 18 inch shuto out.

tHe rolls away at the last moment, slashing Kobo's ankle as
the races past.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
tscreams in pain.  He tries to stop too suddenly.  The bike
tflips over.  Kobo flies into the air then hits the
tpavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road.
tHe stops on his back.  It's lucky he's alive.

tThe SOUND of fast approaching police SIRENS.

<b>tTHE PLATE
</b>
thas fallen out of Kobo's jacket.  It rests in the road,
thalfway between the two men.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
tcrawls toward it on his belly.

<b>tNICK
</b>
tmustering all his strength, struggles across the road on
tall fours.

<b>tKOBO
</b>
tcrawling snake-like.

<b>tNICK
</b>
tstill moving, his arms and legs feel like lead.

<b>tKOBO'S FINGERS
</b>
tas they reach for the plate.

<b>tNICK
</b>
tgrabs Kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate.  Nick
tpicks up a rock.  It looks as if he's going to smash
tKobo's head.  Instead, he brings it down on the plate,
tshattering it in a half-dozen pieces.

tNick tosses the pieces in front of Kobo's face.

<b>tttttNICK
</b>tttKeep the change.

tNick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back.  He looks
tover at Kobo, their faces are inches apart.  Nick makes a
tslashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows.
tThe same gesture Kobo made to Nick through the two-way
tmirror in New York.

tNick passes out.  His eyes shut... the screen...

<b>ttttttttFADES TO BLACK.
</b>
<b>tBLACK SCREEN
</b>
tThe SOUND of three police cars screeching to a halt.  The
tSOUNDS of the police SIRENS winding down.

tThe SIRENS get softer mixing with the SOUND of RINGING
tphones, CLACKING typewriters, VOICES...

tSuddenly, the lights go out.  The fan's stop, so do the

tOhashi looks up to see --

twalking toward him down the long aisle, his left arm is
tbandaged, his right hand handcuffed to Kobo on crutches.

tIch silently leads the captured man down the long aisle to

tstanding at the far end of the room by the fuse box.  He's
talso bandaged and on crutches.

tNick looks at Ohashi without saying a word, then flips the

tHe turns and walks out the door.

ta dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and
twindbreakers with POLICE and TREASURY stenciled on the

tIt lands like a ton of bricks.  Ich continues to read.
