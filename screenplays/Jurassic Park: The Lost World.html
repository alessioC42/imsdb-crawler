tttScreenplay by

tttMichael Crichton

<b>tEXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY
</b>
tA 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
ttropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
tsand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

<b>ttttISLA SORNA
</b>tt87 miles southeast of Nublar

tTwo SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
tpicnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
tlaying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
tdecanters with red and white wine.

tPAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
treading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
tsurprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
tonce, supervises the settings of the table.

tShe looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
tyears old, wandering off down the beach.

<b>ttttMRS. BOWMAN
</b>ttCathy!  Don't wander off!

tCathy keeps wandering.

ttttMRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
ttCathy, come back!  You can look for
ttshells right here!

tCathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.

<b>ttttBOWMAN
</b>ttt(eyes still in his book)
ttLeave her alone.

<b>ttttMRS. BOWMAN
</b>ttWhat about snakes?

<b>ttttBOWMAN
</b>ttThere's no snakes on a beach.  Let
tther have fun, for once.

<b>tFURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,
</b>
tCathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her
tparents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.

<b>ttttCATHY
</b>ttPlease be quiet, please be quiet
ttplease be quiet...

tRounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view
tbehind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she
tturns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
tsand.

tA large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches
tswaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,
twhich abruptly stops moving.

tA small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes
talong its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot
ttall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.
tIt walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.

<b>ttttCATHY
</b>ttWell, hello there!

tThe animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats
tdown on her haunches.

ttttCATHY (cont'd)
ttWhat are you?  A little bird or
ttsomething?

tShe opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.

ttttCATHY (cont'd)
ttAre you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

tThe compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.

ttttCATHY (cont'd)
ttCome on.  I won't hurt you.

tThe compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
tof her hand.  The compy gets closer still --

t-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit
tunder the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up
teasily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats
tit.

tEnchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
thand, calling back over her shoulder.

ttttCATHY (cont'd)
ttMom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!
ttI found something!

tShe turns back.

tThirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're
tstanding there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few
tfeet away.  Cathy's smile fades.

tShe turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS
thave come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing
tand CHIPPING as they surround her.

ttttCATHY (cont'd)
ttt(terrified)
ttWhat do you guys want?

<b>tBACK ON THE BEACH,
</b>
tthe table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.

<b>ttttMRS. BOWMAN
</b>ttCathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

tFrom around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts
tfrom the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
tpierce the air.

<b>ttttMRS. BOWMAN
</b><b>ttPAUL!
</b>
tShe takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of
this chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off
tto help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them.

<b>tDOWN THE BEACH,
</b>
tMrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
tin the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the
tfrenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the
tHands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a
thorrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. BOARD ROOM - DAY
</b>
tMrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
tYAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
tEXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
tmonied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over
tsixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
tlawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
tears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
thint that everyone's been here a long time.

tA familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
tdown the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.

<b>ttttVOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttThe hurricane seemed like a disaster
ttat the time, but now I think it was a
ttblessing, nature's way of freeing
ttthose animals from their human
ttconfines.  Of giving them another
ttchance to survive, but this time as
ttthey were meant to, without man's
ttinterference.

tThe source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
tand creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His
timage is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
tup to the end of the table.

tAnd he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up
tin bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
taround him.

ttttHAMMOND (cont'd)
ttThere are some corporate issues that
ttare not about the bottom line.  We
tthave so much still to learn about
ttthose creatures.  A whole world of
ttintricate, interlocking behaviors,
ttvanished everywhere -- except for
ttSite B. Please.  Let's not do what
ttis good for more men at the expense
ttat what is best for all mankind.

tThe CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.

<b>ttttCHAIRMAN
</b>ttThank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

tHe turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
tanxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
tLudlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
teight by tens, and tosses them on the table.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttt(an accent similar to
ttt Hammond's)
ttThese pictures were taken in a
tthospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
tthours ago, after an American family
tton a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
ttB.  The little girl will be fine, but
tther parents are wealthy, angry, and
ttvery fond of lawsuits.  But that's
tthardly new to us, is it?
ttt(takes a paper from the
ttt file)
ttWrongful death settlements, partial
ttlist:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5
ttmillion dollars; family of Robert
ttMuldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or
ttdestroyed equipment, 17.3 million.
ttDemolition, de-construction, and
ttdisposal of Isla Nublar facilities,
ttorganic and inorganic, one hundred
ttand twenty-six million dollars.  The
ttlist goes on, gentlemen -- research
ttfunding, media payoffs.  Silence is
ttexpensive.

tHe's warming up.  Not a bad performer.

ttttLUDLOW (cont'd)
ttThis corporation has been bleeding
ttfrom the throat for four years.  You,
ttour board of directors, have set
ttpatiently and listened to ecology
ttlectures while Mr. Hammond signed
ttyour checks and spent your money.
ttYou have watched your stock drop from
ttseventy-eight and a quarter to
ttnineteen flat with no good and in
ttsight.  And all along, we have held a
ttsignificant product asset that we
ttcould have safely harvested and
ttdisplayed for profit.  Enormous
ttprofit.

tHe reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
tsending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
tthem.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny
treplicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
tand Tourists look on in wonder.

ttttLUDLOW (cont'd)
ttEnough money to wipe out four years
ttof lawsuits and damage control and
ttunpleasant infighting, enough to not
ttonly send our stock back to where it
ttwas but to double it.  And the one
ttthing, the only thing standing
ttbetween us and this asset is a
ttborn-again naturalist who happens to
ttbe our own CEO.  Well, I don't work
ttfor Mother Nature.  I work for you.

tTwo of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
tLudlow takes one and reads from it.

ttttLUDLOW (cont'd)
tt"Whereas the Chief Executive
ttOfficer has engaged in wasteful and
ttnegligent business practices to
ttfurther his own personal
ttenvironmental beliefs --
ttWhereas these practices have 
ttaffected the financial performance
ttof the company by incurring
ttsignificant losses --
ttWhereas the shareholders have been
ttmaterially harmed by these losses --
ttThereby, be it resolved that John
ttParker Hammond should be resolved from
ttthe office of Chief Executive
ttOfficer, affective immediately."  Mr.
ttChairman, I move the resolution be
ttput to an immediate vote.  Do I have
tta second?

<b>ttttBOARD MEMBER
</b>ttI second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,
ttPlease poll the members by a show of
tthands.

tThe CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't
tbear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.

<b>ttttCHAIRMAN
</b>ttAll those in favor of InGen Corporate
ttResolution 213C, please signify your
ttapproval by raising your right hand.

tIt starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
tup.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises
this right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
tthe TV screen.  It goes blank.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT
</b>
tSparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
tof a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.
tSomewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.

tThe WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big
tbarrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot
tand grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette
tdangling from his lips.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttYeah.

tHe takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He
tsmiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b><b>tINT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tSmoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
tunderneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
tCOMMUTERS and suck up a few more.

tA tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
tas fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just
tbefore they meet --

t-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man
tis IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
tThere's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
tthere's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
tdoesn't care.

<b>tINT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT
</b>
tMALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
tHe looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN
tacross from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The
tCurious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
tapproaches.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttt(under his breath)
ttShit.

tThe Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttYou're him, aren't you?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttExcuse me?

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttThe guy.  The scientist.  I saw you
tton TV.
ttt(conspiratorially)
ttI believed you.

tNo response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer.

ttttMAN (cont'd)
ttRoooooarr.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttt(a withering look)
ttI was misquoted.  I was merely
ttspeculating on the evolutionary
ttscenario of a Lost World.  I never
ttsaid I was in any such place.

tHe gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
tCurious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
tacross from him are staring at him.

tHe looks at them.  They looks away.

tHe pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere
tto hide.

<b>tINT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tA UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:

<b>ttttBUTLER
</b>ttWhom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
ttcalling?

tMALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
tAvenue apartment.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttIan Malcolm

tA door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
tIt bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It
tlunges --

t-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
tThe dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The
tButler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBUTLER
</b>ttNot an animal lover?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttNot really.

<b>tINT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tMALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
tbed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;

tMedical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
tthe furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
tus that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.

<b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttIan!  Don't linger in the doorway
ttlike an ingenue, come in, come in!

tMalcolm steps further into the room.

ttttHAMMOND (cont'd)
ttIt's good to see you.  It really is.
ttHow's the leg?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttResentful.

<b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttWhen you have a lot of time to think,
ttit's funny who you remember.  It's
ttthe people who challenged you.  It is
ttthe quality of our opponents that
ttgives our accomplishments meaning.  I
ttnever told you how sorry I was about
ttwhat happened after we returned.
<b>t
</b>tNoticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
thard to sustain anger.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttI didn't know you -- weren't well.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttIt's the lawyers.  The lawyers are
ttfinally killing me.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThey do have motives.  Why did you
ttwant to see me?  Your message said it
ttwas urgent.
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttYou were right -- and I was wrong.
ttThere!  Did you ever think you'd hear
ttme say that?  Spectacularly wrong.
ttInstead of observing those animals, I
tttried to control them.  I squandered
ttan opportunity and we still know next
ttto nothing about their lives.  Not
tttheir lives as man would have them,
ttbehind electric fences, but in the
ttwild.  Behavior in their natural
tthabitat, the impossible dream of any
ttpaleontologist.  I could have had it,
ttbut I let it slip away.
ttt(pause)
ttThank God for Site B.
<b>tt
</b>tMalcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttWhat?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttt(a spark in his eye)
ttWell?  Didn't it all seem a trifle
ttcompact to you?
<b>tt
</b><b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttThe hatchery, in particular?  You
ttknow my initial yields had to be low,
ttfar less than one percent, that's a
ttthousand embryos for every single
ttlive birth.  Genetic engineering on
ttthat scale implies a giant operation,
ttnot the spotless little laboratory I
ttshowed you.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttI don't believe you.

<b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttIsla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
ttsomething for the tourists, Site B
ttwas the factory floor.  We built it
ttfirst, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
ttmiles from Nublar.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttNo, no, no, no, no, no . . .

<b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttAfter the accident at the park, a
tthurricane wiped out our facility on
ttSite B.  We had to evacuate and leave
ttthe animals to fend for themselves.
ttAnd they did.  For four years I've
ttfought to keep them safe from human
ttmeddling, now I want you to go there
ttand document them.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttAre you out of your mind?  I still
tthave nightmares, my reputation's a
ttjoke, my leg is shot -- you think I
ttneed more of that?

<b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttIt would be the most extraordinary
ttliving fossil record the world has
ttever seen.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttSo what?

tHammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
tto him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos,
tcharts, maps and photographs.

<b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttI've been putting this together for
ttover a year.
<b>ttt(MORE)
</b>ttI have personal suggestions for your
ttentire team, phone numbers, contact
ttpeople.  They won't believe you about
ttwhat they're going to see, so don't
ttbother trying to convince them.  Just
ttuse my checkbook to get them there.
ttI'll fund your expedition through my
ttpersonal accounts, as such money and
ttequipment as you need, but only if
ttyou leave immediately.  If we
tthesitate, all will be lost.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttJohn . . .

<b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttYou'll need an animal behaviorist,
ttsomeone with unimpeachable
ttcredentials.  I believe you already
ttknow Sarah Harding.  She's got
tttheories about parenting and
ttnurturing among hunter/scavengers I
ttbet she'd be dying to prove on a
ttscale like this.  If you convince her
ttto go, it'll be a major coup.  When
ttshe publishes, the scientific
ttcommunity must take it seriously.

tMalcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.

<b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttYour documentation, you should use
ttforensic photographic methods,
ttHasselbladt still cameras, high
ttdefinition video.  When the trick
ttphotography analysts take your
ttevidence apart, make it impossible
ttfor them to say there was enhancement
ttor computer graphic imaging.  Oh,
ttthis is very important -- avoid the
ttisland interior at all costs.  Stick
ttto the outer rim.  Everything you
ttneed to know can be found there.
ttVindication lies on the outer rim.

tMalcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttI'm not going, John.

<b>ttttHAMMOND
</b>ttt(fatigue returning)
ttIan, you are my last chance to give
ttsomething of real value to the world.
ttI can't walk so far and leave no
ttfootprints; die and leave nothing
ttwith my name on it.  I will not  be
ttknown only for my failures.  And you
ttwill not allow yourself to go down in
tthistory as a lunatic.  You're too
ttsmart.  You'e too proud.  Dr.
ttMalcolm.  Please.  This is a chance
ttat redemption.  For both of us.
ttThere's no time to equivocate, we
ttmust seize it now, before --

tHe stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns.
tPETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
tdoorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond
tto Malcolm suspiciously.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttHello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

tMalcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
thim.

ttttLUDLOW (cont'd)
ttDid I interrupt something?

tMalcolm turns back to Hammond.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttFind someone else.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT
</b>
tIn the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
trudely, and shepherds him to the door.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttSo, you two were just, uh, telling
ttold campfire stories, were you?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttDo me a favor.  Don't pretend for a
ttsecond that you and I don't know the
tttruth.  You can convince Time
ttmagazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
ttof whatever you want, but I was 
ttthere.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttYou signed a non-disclosure agreement
ttbefore you went to the island that
ttexpressly forbade you from discussing
ttanything you saw.  You violated that
ttagreement.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttYou cost me my livelihood.  That on
ttwhich I relied to support my
ttchildren.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttIf your university felt you were
ttcausing it embarrassment by selling
ttwild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
ttsee how I am to--

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttI didn't tell anything, I told the
tttruth.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttYou version of it.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThere are no versions of the truth!
ttThis isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
ttmy life.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWe made a generous compensatory offer
ttfor your injuries.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttIt was a payoff and an insult.  InGen
ttnever--

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttInGen is my livelihood, Dr.
ttMalcolm, and I will jealously defend
ttits interests.  People will know what
ttI want them to know when I want them
ttto know it.

tLudlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the
tfoyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
tone hand.  It's his cane.

ttttLUDLOW (cont'd)
ttDon't forget that.

tMalcolm stares at him for a long moment.  Finally, he turns
tand walks away.

tBut he does not out of the apartment.  Instead, he
twalks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
tback into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
ta determined CLICK.

<b>tINT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tHAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
tand walks over to his bed.  He reaches down --

t-- and picks up the file folder.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttDo you have a satellite phone?

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. MOMBASSA BAR - DAY
</b>
tROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
thard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
tAfrican cafe/bar in Mombassa.

tIt's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
tbut there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
tsafari who somehow found the local handout.

tThey're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
teating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
teyeglasses hanging low on his nose.

tRoland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.  He looks
tup.  He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
tperson's name.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttAjay?

tHe turns around.  AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
this late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
tsneak up.

<b>ttttAJAY
</b>ttt(delighted)
ttHow did you know?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttt(taps his nose)
ttThat cheap aftershave I send you
ttevery Christmas, you actually wear
ttit.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit
ttdown, what brings you to Mombassa?

<b>ttttAJAY
</b>ttYou.  Tell me, Roland, when was the
ttlast time you answered your phone?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttLast time I plugged it in, I suppose.
ttWhy?

tBehind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
tOne of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.

<b>ttttAJAY
</b>ttI got a call from a gentleman who's
ttgoing to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
ttIf he's to be believed, it's a most,
ttuh, unique expedition.  And very
ttwell-funded.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWell, I'm a very well-funded old son
ttof a bitch.  You go.

tThe Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.  His
tbuddies LAUGHS.  Roland throws a glance, annoyed.

<b>ttttAJAY
</b>ttBut alone?  We always had great
ttsuccess together, you and I.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttJust a little bit too much, I
ttthink.

<b>ttttAJAY
</b>ttHow do you mean?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttA true hunter doesn't mind if the
ttanimal wins.  If it escapes.  But
ttthere weren't enough escapes from you
ttand me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend

tRoland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
tto turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.  The Tourist
tspins and goes down to the floor, face first.  A cloud of
tsawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.

tThe African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green,

tthe left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The
tworld blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of
tlong grass.

tThe grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
tstealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the
tgrass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between
tits eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face.

twide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer.

tSuddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
tin front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the
thyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They
tyelp and jump, their muzzles bloody.

tThe adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come

tHe leaves.

<b>tINT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY
</b>
tWhile MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
tbackground, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
tthe windows.  They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
tmesh inside it.  She looks around, to see if anybody's
twatching.  They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
ttrailer.

<b>tINT. TRAILER - DAY
</b>
tInside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's
tdivided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
tThe main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
tdissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
tmonitors.

tNext to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
tprocessors, and a communications section.  All the lab
tequipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
tslides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down.

tShe notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa
tRica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
tink.

tKelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
tPacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
tthe highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
tMatanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath
tthe whole island chain, there is a bold legend.

t"The Five Deaths," it says.

tSlowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
tface of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
tof those three ominous words.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:

twith equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of
tMalcolm's team.

<b>tON THE BOAT,
</b>
tMALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to
thim, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing,
tseasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.

ttHelicopters are too disruptive.

tJuttson looks at him skeptically --

<b>tAT THE BACK OF THE BOAT,

tNICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late

tShe looks at him.

<b>ttttSARAH

tThe boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to
tthem.

tThey all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear,
treddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
tthe fog-heavy ocean.

tThe boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The
tmist swirls and encircles it.

<b>tEXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY

tA narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the
tisland interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the
tmouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island.

<b>tEXT. LAGOON - DAY
</b>
tLush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon.
tSulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the
tnearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries
tof JUNGLE BIRDS.

tThe boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
tAAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a
tnarrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
tlagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
tclay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it,
tswapping its track for the animal's.

tMALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.

<b>tEXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY
</b>
tThe jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
tjust beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the
tisland.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley
tshimmers in midday heat.

tEDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and
tflicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving
talong the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of
taluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
tcolor.

tAs the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts
tbegins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging
tstructure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into
tthe air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was
ttested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the
tlowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it
tfrom view.

tNICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
tground.  Malcolm notices.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttListen.  I know you all have probably
ttconcluded that I'm out of my mind.

tIs it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just
tsway slightly?

ttttMALCOLM (cont'd)
ttThat's all right, for now.  But just
tthumor me and be careful.

tNo, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole

tagain.

ttttMALCOLM (cont'd)
ttEven if you think I'm harmless and

tt-- this place is for real.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

<b>tINT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY
</b>
tIt's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
tpost/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the
tshelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
tinput.

tAll the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
tpreservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
tstorage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.

tA plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
tbin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
tthe card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
tdaughter.

tThe card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
tdoor pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
tblankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
tliquid.  We can guess.

tShe leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
tbolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
tShe races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

tA sign on the door says "RESTROOM."  Inside, a SIGH of relief
tis heard.

<b>tEXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

tAlong a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads
ta three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
tchews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are
tbeside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
ttrees to their right.

tAt the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is
tcarrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging
tbeneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and
turgent.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttLindstradt air rifle.  Fires a
ttsubsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

tHe cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic
tcontainers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped
twith a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
ttag -- "EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!"

ttttEDDIE (cont'd)
ttI loaded the enhanced venom of Conus
ttpurpurascens, the South Sea cone
ttshell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in
ttthe world.  Acts within a
tttwo-thousandth of a second.  Faster
ttthan the nerve-conduction velocity.
ttThe animal's down before it feels the
ttprick of the dart.

tFrom their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By
twalking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right
talong with the animals as they move in the foliage.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttt(to Eddie)
ttIs there an antidote?

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttLike if you shoot yourself in the
ttfoot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be
ttdead  before you realized you'd
ttaccidentally pulled the trigger.

tAhead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
tstream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around
tthem, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying
ttrees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in
tdefense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
tand part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden
tmovement --

t-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run
talong a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about
tthree feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the
tstegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a
tbreak in the foliage.

tIt's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a
thuge lumbering body.

tA double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and
tit has a dragging trail with long spikes in it.

tThe gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and
tsticks there.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttOh --

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>tt-- my --

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>tt-- God!

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttIt's beautiful!

tA second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the
tfirst animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult.

tWhile the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and
ta third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of
tthe foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet.

tApparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
tenvironment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed.

tSarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter
tis muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible.

tJuttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
tit breathlessly.

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttStegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
ttinfraorder Stegosauria, suborder
ttThyreophora.  Length, adult male,

tHis breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all
tthings, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers
this mouth, trying to keep him quiet.

tNick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile,
twordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm
tsmiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera.
tNick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
tcontinues on into the bush after the animals.

<b>tIN THE BUSH,
</b>
tthe baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
twhere Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera
tagain and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson,
twho is beside her.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttLone nest -- not colonial.  I don't
ttsee an egg clutch...

tShe gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
tglasses.

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttt(whispering back)
ttThe empty shells are crushed and
tttrampled.  The young stay in the
ttbirth environment, that's conclusive!

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttNot without a shot of the nest.

tShe sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its
tparents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it,
tusing its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
tother two.

tNick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to
tstop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
tbefore she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
tclearing.

<b>tIN THE CLEARING,
</b>
tSarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back,
ttoward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south.
tShe raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd,
tever better as she gets closer.

<b>tBACK AT THE HILL,
</b>
tthe others can only watch her, aghast.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttShe's gutty.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttShe's nuts.

<b>tIN THE CLEARING,
</b>
tSarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping
tof rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect
tposition to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture
tafter picture from this ideal vantage point.

tShe shoots the last picture on the roll --

t-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks
tdown in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her
thands.

tTh noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her
tthe plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and
tstarts to move away, slowly.

tThe male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes
textended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah
tleaps back at the last second --

t-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was.

tSarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
taway, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly
tfor animals their size.

tThe others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her
tback, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts
tright up off the ground.

tIt's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet
tacross, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and
tlooks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a
thundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them.

tThe Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
tHONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them.

tNow a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
tsurrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The
tfirst mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting
tinto position behind the second.

tNick swings his video camera straight up and the group
tsuddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating.

tThe mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
tcome together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING
tto the jungle floor.

tThe group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
twhere the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath
tthe animals!

tAmid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest
tthe jungle around them.

tThe noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER
tand SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.

tThere is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
tunderneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest.

<b>tA SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,
</b>
tthe Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving
twith wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and
tthrows her arms around him, exhilarated.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttIan, you're not insane!  I'm so

</b>
tSuddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
tseriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy
tand excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it
tto a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and
tblows it out.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttNo more smoking.  We leave no scent
ttof any kind.  No hair tonics, no

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThat's a scientific impossibility,
ttyou know.  Heisenberg uncertainty

tNick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
tsharpie, to label it.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttWhat should I call this?  "Jurassic
ttPork?"

tEddie, next to him, laughs.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttt(still to Malcolm)
ttAnd let's forget about the high hide.
ttWe can't do this kind of work up in a

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttI'm not surprised stegosaur lived in

ttpredator birds --

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttThat doesn't say a thing about T-rex,

</b>ttNo way.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttOh, my God.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tt-- way we could safely --

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttOh, no!

tHe takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail,
ttoward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is
trunning.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttFire!

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. BASE CAMP - DAY
</b>
tNICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
tof smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly
tbuilt a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the
tmiddle.

tNick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
tfrom the trees behind him.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttA campfire?!

tNick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttNo!  Water mixes the smoke billow,
ttuse dirt!

tThey start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
thands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttWho the hell started a campfire?!

ttttVOICE (o.s.)
ttIt was just to make lunch.

tMalcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in
tthe doorway of the trailer, sheepish.

ttttKELLY (cont'd)
tttI wanted it ready when you got back.

tThe whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm
thimself.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttOh ... man.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. BASE CAMP - LATER
</b>
tLater, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON,
tNICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the
tfire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera
tequipment, packing up specimen containers and other
tinformation-gathering equipment.

tMALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttYou can't stay, Kelly, that's it.

tHe looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttThe kid scores with cheap sentiment.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttIan, if we recall the boat now, we've

ttbend it right back the way it-

tA low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes
tBOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that
tshakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130
tmilitary cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
tisland interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous,
tfat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

<b>tAT A RIDGE,
</b>
tthe members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
tover a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
tspecific spot.

tEddie raises a pair of field glasses.

<b>tDOWN BELOW,
</b>
thuge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
tcargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat
tanything foolish enough to exist where they want to land.

tNow MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude
tparachutes billowing open behind them.

<b>tUP ON THE RIDGE,

tNick looks at Sarah.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttYou were saying something about

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

<b>tEXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY
</b>
tMetal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR
tto life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser
tbarriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
tHUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp.

tPETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
twear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
tsurroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged,
tpony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWelcome to your dream come true, Dr.
ttBurke.

tBurke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
the spreads out on the hood of a jeep.

<b>ttttBURKE
</b>ttI believe the large herbivores forage
ttin open plains, like bison, which
ttwould explain the great variety of
ttheat dots we're reading in the
ttflatlands around this waterhole.
ttRight -- here.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttThen that's where we're going.

tBurke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
ttimes.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
tunderneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
tcontainer, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
ticon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
tdashboard.

<b>ttttBURKE
</b>ttt(calling them off)
ttHadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!
ttMaiasaurus!

tAs the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the
tman we saw welding earlier.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttThis is as good a place as any for
ttbase camp.  First priority is the
ttlaser barriers, I want them all up
ttand running in thirty minutes.  Half
ttan hour, understand?

tDieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about
ttwenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in
tfront of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the
thunter from the bar in Mombassa.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttCancel that, Dieter.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWhat?  Why?

tRoland points to a stream running nearby.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttCarnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do
ttyou want to set up base camp or an
ttall-you-can-eat people bar?

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttt(thinks)
ttYou heard his, Dieter.  Find a new
ttspot.  And remember, we're after
ttherbivores only -- no unnecessary
ttrisks.

tDieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around
tLudlow and pulls him aside.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttPeter, if you want me to run your
ttlittle camping trip, there are two
ttconditions.  First -- I'm in
ttcharge, and when I'm not around,
ttDieter is.  Your job is to sign the
ttchecks, tell us we're doing a good
ttjob, and open your case of scotch
ttwhen we have a good day.  Second
ttcondition -- my fee.  You can keep
ttit.  All I want in exchange for my
ttservices is the right to hunt one of
ttthe tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck
ttonly.  Why and how are my business.
ttIf you don't  like either of those
ttconditions, you're on your own.  Go
ttahead and set up your camp right
tthere, or in a swamp, or in the middle
ttof a rex nest, for all I care.  But
ttI've been on too many safaris with
ttrich dentists to listen to any more
ttsuicidal ideas.  Okay?

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttt(what else can he say?)
ttOkay.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttGood lad.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. JUNGLE
</b>
tThe jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the
tHunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER
tSTARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
t"speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
tthe wheel beside him.

tLUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE.
tROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They
tlook up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
tstops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.

tIn the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
tfront of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks
taround the front of the car and sees --

t-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
tjungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set
tanimals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,
ta tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
theads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at
tLudlow, who look at Dr. Burke.

tBurke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.

<b>ttttBURKE
</b>ttPachycephalosaurus!

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttCarnivore?

<b>ttttBURKE
</b>ttt(enchanted)
ttHuh?  No!  No, herbivore, late
ttCretaceous.  Very unusual plant
tteater, see that distinctive domed
ttskull?  That's nine inches of solid
ttbone.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttt(who cares?)
ttJust get them out of the way, Dieter.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b><b>ttCOME ON, MOVE IT!!
</b>
tThe pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows
tchewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with
tthem, they go back to their grass.

ttttDIETER (cont'd)
ttOh, for God's --

tHe slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
tclosest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the
tsecond jeep.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttDieter.  This is a round-up, not a
ttwar.  Use your powers of persuasion.

tDieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does,
tslowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do
tnot move.  Dieter walks toward them.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttCome on, come on, don't have all
ttday!

<b>ttttBURKE
</b>ttt(going on to no one in
ttt particular)
ttSee, the pachy's neck attaches at the
ttbottom of its skull instead of the
ttback of its head, as with reptiles.

tThe speedbird draws closer.  The first pachy stares at it
tintently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --

t-- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out
tof the way.

ttttBURKE (cont'd)
ttSo when it lowers its head, its neck
ttlines up directly with its
ttbackbone --

<b>tBEHIND DIETER,
</b>
tAjay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.  He
ttakes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back
ttoward Roland.

<b>ttttAJAY
</b>ttRoland.

<b>tUP AT THE FRONT,
</b>
tthe pachys turn and hop away.  Dieter turns and heads back to
tthe speedbird.  As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
t"look out!" from behind him.  Dieter spins around, just in
ttime to see --

t-- the first pachy in full charge.  It SLAMS headfirst into
tthe speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.

<b>ttttBURKE
</b>ttt(concluding his lecture)
ttWhich is perfect for absorbing
ttimpact.

tDieter turns and runs around to the front of the car.  The
tpachy has backed up  for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
<b>tAT HIM.
</b>
tDieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to
tprotect himself.

tSLAM!  The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying
tagainst the car, knocking the wind out of him.

tIn the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
tout the window for a better look, laughing.

tPOW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It
tbounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as
tDieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
tspeedbird.

tBut the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's
tforced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
tspeedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
tvehicle.

tNow the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the
tDriver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
tcar again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
tMANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,
tvastly amused.

<b>tA FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,
</b>
tAjay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
tanimal footprint, three-toed, enormous.

<b>ttttAJAY
</b>ttIt matches the pictures.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttIt certainly does.

tRoland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the
tpachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.
tRoland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --

t-- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled
t.600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in
timmaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,
tbisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.

tThe barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory
tbead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,
tbreaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
tshirt pocket.

tFour inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
tthese are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.
tHe slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.

tRoland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals
ttrashing the speedbird for the first time.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b><b>ttHEY!
</b>
tThe pachys all freeze, staring at him.  Roland waves one hand,
tHISSES sharply between his teeth --

t-- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle.  Takes care
tof that problem.  Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,
tcalling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.

ttttROLAND (cont'd)
ttDon't worry about us.  We'll catch
ttup.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWhere do you think you're going?!

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttTo collect my fee.

tAnd with that he disappears into the foliage.

tThe Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
tbattered car GROANS forward.  As it moves ahead, it reveals
tDIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.

<b>tIN THE JUNGLE,
</b>
tAjay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree
tangle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
tlead.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttAjay.

tAjay turns.  Roland points in the direction in which the
tfootprints lead.

ttttROLAND (cont'd)
ttI'm no tracker, but even I can read
ttthis spoor.

<b>ttttAJAY
</b>ttDo you wish to go where the animal

tRoland smiles.  Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
tfollows.

tSeen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to

<b>tEXT. THE CAVES - DAY
</b>
tAJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
tinto a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into
tthe rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the
tfar left.

tRoland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
tbreeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good.

tHe proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They
tcan see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a
tblack interior.

tRoland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he
tsees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,
tcrawling with white maggots and flies.

tRoland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the
tskull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin
tstill adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.

tStill he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and
tthey edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd
tSQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.

tCrawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
trampart of dried mud, and peer into --

t-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten
tfeet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.

tA BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the
tcenter of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and
tits body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a
tscraggly appearance.

tIt SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
tchunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp
tteeth.

tThe cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
tthe edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a
tbandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and
<b>tWHISPERS.
</b>
<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttIt's the rex nest.

tAjay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
tup, cocking its head in curiosity.

<b>ttttAJAY
</b>ttMake a blind here?  Wait for the buck
ttto return?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttt(shakes his head no)
ttIf the nest is upwind, so are we.
ttWhen he comes back, he'll know we're
tthere before we have a chance.  The
tttruck --

tIn the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders.

ttttROLAND (cont'd)
tt-- is to get him to come where we
ttwant him.

tThe baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks
tdown at it.  Thinking.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. RIDGE - DUSK
</b>
tAs the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a
tpair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
tbelow the ridge.

tIn the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed
therd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS,
tand CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below.
<b>t
</b>tMALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge
tbeside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back
tpressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the
tridge.

<b>tTHROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS
</b>
tWe see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The
tbinoculars whip to the right --

t-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in
tfact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES!

tThere are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier
tmini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a
twrangler's pickup truck.

tAlthough there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's
talmost eerily silent.

<b>tON THE RIDGE,
</b>
tNick lowers the binoculars, angry.  When he raises them again,
tthe sun FLARES off the lens --

<b>tEXT. THE PLAIN - DUSK
</b>
t-- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in
tthe middle of the roundup.  Engines ROAR, wheels spin and dig
tin the dirt, men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
tvehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed.

tThe HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee, incredulous and
tthrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.

<b>ttttHUNTER
</b><b>ttLOOK AT THESE THINGS!
</b>
<b>ttttHUNTER 2
</b><b>ttTHEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE
</b><b>ttBEAUTIFUL!!!
</b>
tOne of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the
tothers.  DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat, holding a
tlong pole with a noose dangling from the end of it.

tHe swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
tthe driver.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b><b>ttFASTER!
</b>
tThe Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining
ton the herd.  Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers
tto the right, toward the cover of thick jungle --

t-- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting
tthem off, herding them back out into the open.

<b>tBACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK,
</b>
tPETER LUDLOW stands in a "conning tower," a command post in
tthe heaviest pursuit vehicle.  He BARKS into a walkie-talkie.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttAlive, Dieter, and uninjured!

<b>tBACK ON THE SNAGGER,
</b>
tthe Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
tthrown by the herd ahead of him.  Dieter CURSES and throws the
tlasso pole into the back of the jeep.  Ludlow's voice
tcontinues over the radio in Dieter's jeep.

ttttLUDLOW (o.s.)
ttThose are very expensive animals!
ttCan you hear me?!

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttt(to the Driver)
ttTurn that off!

tThe Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
trifle from the back of the vehicle.

<b>tTHE MOTORCYCLE
</b>
tguns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the 
tplain.  From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous
tnecks rise up in alarm.  Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
tbush and lumber out across the middle of the plain.

tThe herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running,
tscampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
tmassive legs.

tOne smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle
tcuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes
tthe motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
tthe apotosaurs.

tThe bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the
tapatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the
tjuvenile.

tAnother truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal.
tHigh in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
tcannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down.

tHe FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
tneck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
ta lasso around its neck.

tThey crank a winch, reeling in the animal.

tAs the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what
tlook like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
tthe truck.

tAs the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a
thydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags.

tNow a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The
tscissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in
tthis dino-contaiment vehicle.

tTwo HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
tthe scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched
tbetween the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig.

tThe Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
tand it takes off, back into the hunt.

<b>tBACK ON THE SNAGGER,
</b>
tDieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat,
twhips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place.  He
tjabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard.

tImmediately, a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
tseat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to

tDieter raises the gun, picks a CARINTHOSAUR, a red-crested
therbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim.

<b>tBANG!!
</b>
tThe carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
tits left hindquarter.

<b>tUP ON THE RIDGE,
</b>
tthere is utter quiet.  Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
tthe spectacle below.

<b>tDOWN ON THE PLAIN,
</b>
tthe snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge
tcloud of dust and dirt.

tThe motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its DRIVER pushing
this mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face.

tThe wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which
tCLANGS heavily to the ground.

tFOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
tthe ramp and out of the truck.

tDieter jumps off the snagger.  He puts down his tranquilizer
tgun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly.
tAhead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet.

tThe sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance
twhile it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttEasy -- easy -- not too close!
ttFull extension!

tThe Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three
tfeet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten
tfoot tall animal.

ttttDIETER (cont'd)
ttNow!

tAlmost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the
tstunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold
ttheir poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it.

<b>tUP ON THE RIDGE,
</b>
tNick turns away.  He can't watch.

<b>tDOWN ON THE PLAIN,
</b>
ta bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either
tend, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS
tto the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat.

tLudlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
tthe helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes
tglowing.

tThe animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily.
tDieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding
tand thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck.

tA blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
tcarinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a
thorrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air.

tDR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a
tsyringe.

tHe draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
tinjects it into the animal's thigh.

tCARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint
tand quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
torange.

tDieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
tdashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
tthe animal.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. RIDGE - NIGHT
</b>
tNight has fallen over the island.  The hunters have
testablished base camp in an area they have trampled and
tcleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the
tperimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a
tcentral campfire.

tThe vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents.
tAt the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture
tcontainers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
thave already rounded up.

tSARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above,
tlooking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back
tfrom the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge.
tVOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING.

tIn the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
tsits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
tPETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.

<b>tEXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
</b>
tIn the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is
tbent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to
tit.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what
tprotest.  Roland looks up.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttOffering a little incentive.

tLudlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and
toffers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's
tgun leaning against a tree.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWhat kind of gun is that?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttMy father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made
ttin 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to

ttelephant.  8700 foot pound striking
ttforce.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttHow close do you have to be?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttForty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume
ttit'll take a slug in the brain case
ttto bring him down.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWhy not just use a scope and a poison
ttdart and snipe him from a hill?

tRoland just looks at him.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttOr a laser beam from a satellite?

tLudlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it
twhile it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut
twith a leather strap.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttYou rally think this'll draw the
ttparent?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttI once saw a bull elephant die
ttcharging a jeep.  All the jeep had
ttdone was startle the bull's calves.
ttI saw a lioness carry wounded prey
ttfour and a half miles, all the way

</b>ttKilling lessons?  Heartwarming.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttRex won't be any different.  It'll

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttYou're kidding yourself.  An adult

tCRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut,
tlunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the
tbridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain,
tclutching his bleeding face.

tRoland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up
tRoland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's
tleg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
tpain.

tRoland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage
tis done.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWhat the hell you do that for?!

tAs his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts
tto cover.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttHad to.  To keep him still for the
tttrip.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttYou've broken its leg!

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWe've got to transport it seven
ttthousand miles.  Would you prefer it
ttbit off the leg of a crew member?

tHe gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp,
ttrying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
tAt the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM
tscramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
tbarriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart,
tthe tallest almost six feet off the ground.

tNick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm,
tsteps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a
tCRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then
tleft alone on the other side.

tHe backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then
tsprings off his good leg --

t-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands
twith a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two.

<b>tFURTHER IN THE CAMP,
</b>
tthe three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel
tbarrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're
tdirectly behind the row of vehicle.

tThey move, into the open, covering the ground between them and
tthe jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
tunder the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout.

<b>tUNDER THE JEEP,
</b>
tNick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms
talong until he finds the jeep's fuel line --

t-- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the
tstream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.

<b>tMALCOLM AND SARAH
</b>
tmove slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out
tfrom under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They
thear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves
tto the third.

tFrom in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint,
thigh-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that
tdirection.

<b>tEXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT
</b>
tIt's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree,
tROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
tform a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground.

tThey wait.

tRoland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills
tall the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He
tscans it, searching for any sign of movement.

<b>tEXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
tBack in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with
tall of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is
tparked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool
tarea is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline.

tThe saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the
tdrunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the
tpartiers visible as they move inside.

tThey continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

t-- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was
ttranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and
tglassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its
trow of fine bristling.

tAnd finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a
ttriceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his
ttrusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttHang on.  We may encounter some
ttturbulence.

<b>tINT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
tIn one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
tsatellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
tday's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
tThere are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
tphotos, indicating where certain species can be found.

<b>ttttBURKE
</b>ttIf you're really interested in
ttinfants, we'll have better luck at
ttthe seaside, because the sands offer
tta cushioning surface where the egg
ttclutches can -- can --

tHe trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
tthe little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.

tThey look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside,
tsomeone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
thopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
tturn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --

t-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!

<b>tEXT. CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
tHUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns
ttearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men
tSHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
tconfusion, chaos reigns.

tIn the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and
tSARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
tin another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey.

tThe triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right
tthrough the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
<b>tINTO FLAME.
</b>
tNow really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all
tdirections, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting
tablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable
thindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling
tacross the camp.

tThe jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side.
tIts broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits
tone of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
tits wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas.

tThe jeep explodes.

<b>tOUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING,
</b>
tRoland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a
tfireball rises up from the camp in the distance.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWhat in God's -- !

<b>tBACK IN THE CAMP,
</b>
tthe rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
tcamp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
tthe sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
tanimals.

<b>tAT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,
</b>
tNick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
tbordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
tdirection, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other.

tThe burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates
tin a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS.

tDieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
tseries of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all
tfours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past
thim, spinning to a stop --

t-- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttLast time I leave you in charge.

<b>tOUT IN THE JUNGLE,

tNick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where
tAjay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur
tchained to the stake.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttSick bastards.

tHe goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken
tleg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls
tthe stake out of the ground.

<b>tBACK IN THE CAMP,
</b>
tRoland surveys the destruction.  The fire has spread and
tseveral tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air,
tthe animals are gone or going, and their personnel are

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttNick, thank God, we didn't know

tMalcolm opens the rear door.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttWait, don't ---

tWith a piercing SHRIEK, the BABY TYRANNOSAUR, now in the back
tof the AAV, flings itself at the open doorway, jaws SNAPPING
tjust short of Malcolm's nose.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b><b>ttHOLY SHIT!!
</b>
tHe SLAMS the door.

<b>tDOWN IN THE HUNTERS' CAMP,
</b>
tRoland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttDo we have anyone up there?

<b>tBACK UP ON THE RIDGE,
</b>
tMalcolm is confronting Nick.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>tt<U< your of out you>?!

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttIt has a broken leg!

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttSo do it a favor and put it out of
ttits misery!

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttNo!  Get in the car before they hear 
ttus!

tHe runs around and leaps in the driver's seat.  Sarah slips
tinto the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice
tbut the rear.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage.  From inside the
tcar, we can hear the baby tyrannosaur SCREAMING in anger.

<b>tINT. AAV - NIGHT
</b>
tThe baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
tflattened himself against the door, as far away from the
tanimal as possible.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttIan, close the window, it's going to
ttwake every predator in the jungle!

tMalcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
twindow.  The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
tlegs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.  He SHOUTS in pain.

tOutside, the listening jungle whizzes by.

<b>tEXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT
</b>
tUp in the high hide, EDDIE, DR. JUTTSON, and KELLY are
tstanding watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their
treturning comrades.

tJuttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
tas he spots the AAV, pulling up to the base camp a couple
thundred yards away.

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttThere they are!

tThey all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching
tthem pull the wounded animal from the back seat.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttWhat is that they have with them?

<b>tEXT. CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
tSARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their
tarms, headed for the trailer.  MALCOLM, holding his bleeding
tarm, isn't far behind.

<b>tINT. TRAILER - NIGHT
</b>
tSARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
ttable and hold it down.  MALCOLM is right behind them.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThis is exceedingly unwise.

tSarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
tsmall syringe.  Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
tbaby's injured leg.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttToo late to worry about that!  Hold
tthim together, Nick!

tNick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
tinjection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttJust do whatever you have to do and
ttget it out of here as quickly as
ttpossible.

tSarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
tthe animal's leg.  A green and white skeletal image appears on
ta monitor next to the table.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttOkay, there's the metatarsals --
tttibia, fibula -- there it is!  See
ttit?  That's a fracture, just above
ttthe epiphysis.

tThey peer closely at the monitor.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttThat little black line?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttThat little black line means death
ttfor this infant.  The fibula won't
ttheal straight, so the ankle joint
ttcan't pivot when he stands on his
tthind feet.  The baby won't be able to
ttrun, and probably can't even walk.
ttIt'll be crippled, and a predator
ttwill pick it off before it gets more
ttthan a few weeks old.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttCan you set up?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttt(thinking)
ttIt has to be temporary, something
ttthat'll break apart and fall off as
ttthe animal grows...

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThink fast, Sarah.

tThe tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.

<b>tEXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT
</b>
tThrough their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the
ttrailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are
tclearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttWhat are they doing?  Why don't
ttthey hurry?!

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttGive me the radio.

tFrom the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive
<b>tSHRIEK --
</b>
tOne by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare
tinto the night jungle.

<b>tINT. TRAILER - NIGHT
</b>
tNICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
taround its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
tMALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal
tthrashes again.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttGive it more morphine!

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttWe'll kill it with too much, we'll
ttput it into respiratory arrest!  I'm
ttalmost done.  Damn it, I need
ttanother adhesive, something pliable I

tHer eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
ttSpit!

tHe spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby
trex CRIES OUT again.

<b>tEXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT
</b>
tFrom the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR.

tAnd this one's closer.

tIn the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In
tthe distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
ttops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly
tcoming alive, as if brushed by wind.

tBut it's not the wind.

tThey hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another
tsection of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds
tbursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttWhat is it?

tDr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling
ther closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
twalkie-talkie.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttSarah, come in!

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttIt's moving.  Fast.

<b>tINT. TRAILER - NIGHT
</b>
tThere is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
tThe speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.

ttttEDDIE (o.s.)
ttSarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

tOn the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
tinto place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex,
tregaining its strength, is thrashing again.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttHold it down, Nick!

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttI'm trying!

ttttEDDIE (o.s.)
ttt(from the radio)
ttIs anybody there?!

tMalcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttIan, get the bottle of amoxicillin
ttand fill a syringe!  Quick injection
ttof antibiotics and I can get it out
ttof here!

tForsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
tcomes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty
tcc's of the pink liquid.

ttttEDDIE (o.s.)
ttt(still from the radio, now
ttt desperate)
<b>ttSARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME!
</b>
tThey ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
tinjection.

ttttEDDIE (o.s.)

</b>

</b>
tNick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
tpiece of information.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttOh, Christ.

tHe bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.

ttttMALCOLM (cont'd)
ttLet me talk to Kelly, is she--

tA deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
tfollowed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look
tto the window, just in time to see --

t--  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!

tThere is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
tresponse.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
tTYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.

tMalcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.

tThe rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The
tbaby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.

tBut across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
<b>tHEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS.
</b>
tThis one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
tanything in the trailer that isn't tied down.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttWhat do they want?!

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttWhat do you think they want?!

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttThat's impossible, they can't have
ttthe sensory equipment to track it all
ttthe way here!

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttCurrent evidence seems to be to the
ttcontrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT
<b>ttTO THEM!
</b>
tNick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
tearlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
tinto an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
tfresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.

tSarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
ttrailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes
tstay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
tthrough the window.

<b>tEXT. TRAILER - NIGHT
</b>
tSeen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly
tilluminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The
tadult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly
tas long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over,
twatching their infant.

<b>tINT. TRAILER - NIGHT
</b>
tAt the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttReady?

tMalcolm reaches for the door handle.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttWait!

tHe dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
tcamera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a
tbreath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.

tOutside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
tsurprised.

tAlthough terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttt(softly)
ttBorn free, as free as the wind blows.
ttAs free as the grass grows --

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttAre you insane?!

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttI swear to God, it works with lions
ttsometimes!  There we are -- your baby
ttis free --

tThe baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
tground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
tshut.

tThe three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they
tcan hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
tinspect their young --

t-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
tas they move away.

tFrom the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttThey're going back into the jungle.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

tEDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttThank God.  Thank God.

tMALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.

ttttMALCOLM (o.s.)
ttKelly?  Are you all right?

tShe takes the radio, her voice shaky.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttUh huh.

ttttKELLY (o.s.)
ttI understand.

tMalcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and
tNICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
tcompletely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
tspeaks shakily into it.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttNote to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
ttrex does nurture its young.

tThey laugh weakly.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttThere's, uh -- there's an unwritten
ttrule when a news crew is in a war
ttzone.  You stop the van every two
ttmiles and decide whether or not to go

ttOne "no" from anybody in the group

ttWell?  Do we go on?
tImmediately:

</b>ttNo way.

tThey all laugh.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttAll right.  I'm satisfied with the

ttI feel vindicated.  John Hammond will
tttoo.
ttt(to Sarah)
ttDo you have enough to publish?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttThey will come after me.  But I can

ttThen the only thing left to do is

ttright now.  This expedition is over.

tHe goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
tphone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel
tlights up, a brilliant green.

tBut from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
tVOICE breaks through, soft and empty.

ttttEDDIE (o.s.)
ttOh, God.  I am so sorry.

tMalcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttWhat the hell is he sorry f-

tA low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and
tNick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The
tRATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
teverything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

t-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.

tThey're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
tearsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
tand sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.

tThe satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
tagainst the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still
tglowing green.

tNick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside,
tthe flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
trevealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
ttrailer!

<b>ttttNICK
</b><b>ttHANG ON TO SOMETHING!
</b>
tThey hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
tfor dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
ttrailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is
tquickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the
tentire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.

tSarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
tand drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
teverything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
teverything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.

tBut the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
tsliding forwards.

<b>tSEEN FROM OUTSIDE,
</b>
tthe upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
ttrailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
tfront of it.

<b>tIN THE TRAILER,
</b>
<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttThey're pushing us!

tMalcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
tHe looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
tas they move past it.

tHe cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
tthey are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees
toutside the window.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttOh, God.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttWhat?!

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThey're pushing us over the cliff.

tSure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
tmuddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of
tthem look at each other for a moment --

t-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
ttrailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
tstarts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the
taccordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.

<b>tTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER,
</b>
twhich is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
tit, pushing the front end of the trailer.

<b>tIN THE REAR TRAILER,
</b>
tNick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
tSarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
tstarts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.

tThe angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
tfreefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.

tMalcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah,
tstarting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
tgetting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety
tlatch, doesn't open.

tBelow Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
tThrough the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
thundred feet below.

tThe refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The
tbox strains on its power cord.

tStill clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
tto come loose, swaying above her.

tThe safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
tshower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
tcontents.

tSarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
ttrailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
trear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.

<b>tFIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW,
</b>
tan enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.  Above, Sarah is a
ttiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
tbreaking window.

<b>tIN THE TRAILER,
</b>
tNick SHOUTS to her.

<b>ttttNICK
</b><b>ttSARAH!  DON'T MOVE!
</b>
tSarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
tsenses.  She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
tFor a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.  As
tshe stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
tShe blanches; the world spins around her.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttOH... GOD ... please...

tHer breath fogs the cracked glass.  Slowly, she tries to get
tup, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.

tBut as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
tmore, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.  The
twhole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
ttrailer.

<b>tUP ABOVE HER,
</b>
tMalcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
tbalanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
tglowing green.  Nick is closest to it.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttNick!  Grab the phone!

<b>tSARAH
</b>
tlooks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
twall of the trailer.  She shifts her weight, leaning on one
thand to reach for the grating with the other.

<b>tNICK
</b>
treaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
tfrom his outstretched fingers.

<b>tSARAH
</b>
tleans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
taround her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.  The
tsplintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
tof the frame --

t-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.  She GASPS and
tpulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
tglass.

<b>tNICK
</b>
thas two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
tshudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.

<b>ttttNICK
</b><b>ttSARAH LOOK OUT!
</b>
<b>tSARAH
</b>
tlunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
theavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
topening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.

<b>tUNDERNEATH THE TRAILER,
</b>
tglass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
tfall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.

<b>tIN THE CLEANING,
</b>
tthe trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
tstraight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
tcliff.  Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
tback into the jungle.

<b>tIN THE TRAILER,
</b>
tSarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.  Above her, Nick
tlowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.

<b>tON THE CLIFFSIDE,
</b>
twe realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
tcorner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
tout from the muddy cliff.

tBut now those branches SPLINTER.

<b>tIN THE TRAILER,
</b>
tMalcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
tstretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.

<b>tBELOW HIM,
</b>
tSarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
tinadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
tpurchase.

<b>tOUTSIDE,
</b>
tthe tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
tagain.  The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
tlike a Slinky.

<b>tINSIDE,
</b>
tNick knows he has to hurry.  He climbs down, bouncing off the
tbuilt-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.

tBut Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.  She
tgabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.

<b>tEXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

tEDDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through
tthe jungle as fast as he can.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttHang on -- hang on --

tThe foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly,
trevealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
thim.  The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
trex and SKIDS to a halt.

<b>tINT. TRAILER - NIGHT
</b>
tSarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
tframe of the half-broken rear window again.

<b>tOUTSIDE,
</b>
tEddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He
tSHOUTS in through the broken front window.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b><b>ttHEY!  HELLO?!
</b>
<b>tIN THE REAR TRAILER,
</b>
tThe three look up from their precarious positions.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b><b>ttWE'RE IN HERE!  GET SOME ROPE!
</b>
<b>tOUTSIDE,
</b>
tEddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of
trope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
ttrailer.

<b>tIN THE REAR TRAILER,
</b>
tEddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
tinto the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down
tinto the second trailer, and tosses the rope.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttCatch!

tThe rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
tdangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the
ttrailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttWe're sliding!

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttClimbs up if you can!

<b>tOUTSIDE,
</b>
tEddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
tdragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
ttrailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.

tHe runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
tfront grill.

tBehind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.

tEddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
tbehind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
tits towing hook, the cable goes taut --

t-- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of
tcable.

<b>ttttEDDIE
</b>ttDamn it!

<b>tINSIDE THE TRAILER,
</b>
tNick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
tbottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is
tfurther up, also clinging to the rope.

<b>tOUTSIDE,
</b>
tdirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
tedge of the cliff.

tEddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns
tand races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
<b>tTHE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND!
</b>
tEddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
tsecurely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches
ttoward the edge of the cliff and stops.

tBut the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.

<b>tIN THE TRAILER,
</b>
tMalcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
tNick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
tthem back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING,
tthey slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
tthe remains of the rear window.

tRegaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
tnow find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
tdangling over the rocky shore below.

<b>tIN THE JEEP,
</b>
tEddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
tget a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
ttrailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold
tit there.

<b>tON THE CLIFFSIDE
</b>
tSarah and Nick dangle, desperate.

<b>tIN THE JEEP
</b>
tEddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
tengine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
tROAR, in the distance.

tAnd this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He
tGUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle.

tEddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view
tmirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
tthe jungle behind him.

tHe GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the
tOTHER REX racing toward him.

tThe tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
tThe first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
tlifts the car to its teeth.

tBut the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
tSurprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
tthe jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.

tEddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
taway.  The gas pedal pops up --

t-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.

tBut the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
tThe trailers stop.

tNow the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
twho still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex
tSNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
texposed.

tHe SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
tteeth and tossing him out of the car.

tEddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
theads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
tdisappears between their teeth.

tNow completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
ttrailers drop over the edge of the cliff.

<b>tINSIDE THE TRAILER,
</b>
tNick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
tthe trailers fall around them.  The windows flash by as the
ttrailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
thold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.

<b>tON THE CLIFFSIDE,
</b>
tthe trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
twho pop out the space where the front windshield was.
tDangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
tis now rolling to the edge of the cliff.

tIt falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
tbelow.  Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
tsurf.

<b>tEXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
</b>
tIt's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen.  At the
tcliff, a hand appears from over the edge.  Then another.
tSARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes
tNICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
tthe edge.

tThey collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttt(softly)
ttEddie?

tHe looks at the other two.  They glance around, then drop
ttheir heads.  Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttOh, God.  Now what?

tFrom the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams
tmoves toward them.  But rather than the three or four that
twould signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of
tthem.

tThe HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJAY
twith him.  DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR.
tJUTTSON along in front of him.

tMalcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race
ttogether.  Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
tas he possibly can.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttAre you all right?!  Anything broken?

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttI'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I
ttthought you, are you okay?!

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttI'm fine... I'm fine...

tRoland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttt(mostly to himself)
ttThat's what you think.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
tIn the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of
tthe night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a
theated argument.

tMALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms,
tjust looking down at the ground and shaking his head.  There's
tsomething about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
tthan any of the hot tempers that are flaring.  LUDLOW rants to
tSARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttTrespassing, sabotage -- you could go
ttto jail just for being here, did
ttyou know that?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttDon't start a legal argument with me,
ttthis island isn't your property, and
ttneither are these animals!

tDR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttWhat are you doing here, Burke?
ttThere's no TV cameras, what's the
ttpoint?

<b>ttttBURKE
</b>ttDr. Juttson, you exist outside the

tDieter continues to get in Nick's face.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttAre you looking for a problem?

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttt(an urgent whisper)
ttEveryone, keep your voices down!

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttBack off, Dieter.

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttListen to me, by moving the baby

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttTheir what?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttt(she understands)
ttOh, God.

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttThat's why they persisted in

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttt(of Sarah and Nick)
ttThanks to you people.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttHey, we came here to observe, you
ttcame here to strip-mine the place!
ttIt's a looter mentality, all you care
ttabout is what you can take.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttNone of that matters.  Our
ttcommunications equipment's been
ttdestroyed.  If your radio and
ttsatellite phone were in those
tttrailers that went off the cliff, and
ttI'm guessing by the look on his
ttface --

tHe points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in
tstunned silence.  Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly.  The
tgrimness of their situation sinks in.

ttttROLAND (cont'd)
ttWe are stuck here, ladies and
ttgentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
tBack in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two
tgroups combine their diminished supplies.  They have half a
tdozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven
tcontainers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins,
ta variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or
tshoulders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggly
tremnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
tequipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered
tpaperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and
ta cartoon of Marlboros.

tROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which are
tdisplayed in front of him.  LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, and
tMALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are with
thim.  They hold their discussion in quiet tones.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttIf we can't stay in the rex's
ttterritory, we have to move tonight.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttMove where?  Our boat's not coming
ttfor two days, your airlift is waiting
ttfor an order you have no way to
ttsend --

tLudlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
tphotographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttThere's a communication center, here,
ttin the old worker village.  Hammond
ttput in some kind of renewable power
ttsource replenishing.  It may still
ttwork.  If we could get there, we
ttcould send a radio call for the
ttairlift.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttHow far is the village?

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttI said if we could get there.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttWell, how far is it?

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttA day's walk, maybe more.  That's not
ttthe problem.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWhat is?

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttThe velociraptors.

tMalcolm looks up sharply.

ttttLUDLOW (cont'd)
ttOur infrareds show their nesting
ttsites are concentrated in the island
ttinterior.  That's why we planned on
ttkeeping to the outer rim.

tMalcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
tsomething to her quietly in the background.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttWhat are velociraptors?

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttCarnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six
ttfeet long, three or four hundred
ttpounds, and very, very fast.

tDieter brandishes his weapon.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttI think we can handle ourselves
ttagainst them.

tMalcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice
tlow.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttNo.  I'm quite certain you can't.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttLook, we have two choices.  We can
tthike back down to the lagoon, where
ttwe can sit for two days, in the open,
ttnext to a heavily used water source
ttwhile we're waiting for your boat to
ttarrive, or we can head for the
ttvillage, where we might find some
ttshelter and we can call for help.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttWe'd never make it past the raptors.
ttTrust me, I have some experience in
ttthis matter.

tRoland looks at him.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttThat may be.  But you weren't with
ttme at the time.

tMalcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to
tKelly.  Roland turns to the others.

ttttROLAND (cont'd)
ttLoad up.  Let's get this moveable
ttfeast underway.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. ISLAND - NIGHT
</b>
tThe SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a
tcolumn.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
tservo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in
tsensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus
tattached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights
tturn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in.

tMALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
tit over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks
tdown at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows
tthe deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttDamn it.

tHe looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND
tfalls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttYou all right?

tMalcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.

ttttROLAND (cont'd)
ttWrong question?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttYou ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttA statistical phenomenon.  Says
tteverything in the world goes in
ttstreaks.  It's real, you see it
tteverywhere -- in weather, in river
ttflooding, in baseball, in blackjack,
ttin stock markets.  Once things go
ttbad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad
ttthings cluster.  They go to hell
tttogether.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttFeeling a bit blue, are we?

tMalcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace
tand is a few steps ahead of them now.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttJust -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWhy did you come here?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttSo that others would know about this
ttplace?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWhy should they?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttBecause it exists.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttIt'll still exit if they go on not
ttknowing, won't it?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttYes.  And people will live in the
ttabsence of truth.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttSo the truth is more important to you
ttthan your life?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttt(lowers is voice)
ttI don't care about my life.  But if
ttI'd ever thought for a second that
ttshe would be in danger --

tRoland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten
tyards ahead now.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttShe yours?

<b>tAHEAD OF THEM,
</b>
tKelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear.  They are not
tas far away as they think they are.

ttttMALCOLM (o.s.)
ttI'm afraid so.  I don't know what the
tthell I'm doing with kids.  I never
ttshould have had her.

tKelly's face shows she heard that part.

<b>tBEHIND HER,
</b>
tMalcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.

ttttMALCOLM (cont'd)
ttWhy are you here?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttSomewhere on this island, there
ttexits the greatest predator that
ttever lived.  And the second greatest
ttpredator must take him down.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttBut why?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttYou remember that guy, about twenty
ttyears ago, I forget his name, but he
ttclimbed Everest without any oxygen,
ttcame down almost dead.  And they
ttasked him, "why did you go up there
ttto die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I
ttwent up there to live."

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttt(nods)
ttIt's called self-testing.  But in
ttyour case, it sounds more like
ttself-destruction.  A uniquely human
ttcharacteristic.  In fact, human
ttbeings destroy things so well that I
ttsometimes think that's our function.
ttMaybe every few sons, some animal
ttcomes along that kills off the rest
ttof the world, clears the decks, and
ttlets evolution proceed to his next
ttphase.  Maybe death and destruction
ttare our job, maybe we're supposed
ttto destroy ourselves and every other
ttliving thing that-

tEvery person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
tstaring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm
tby the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttTell you what.  You can see whatever
ttyou want to, to me, but you will not
ttspew any more nihilist rants at
ttanyone else in the group.  I'm
ttfighting panic, and you push the
ttwrong buttons.  Understand?

tMalcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. JUNGLE - DAWN
</b>
tAs a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS
tstagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there
tare spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting
tworse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm
tswats his hand away.

tKELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttI don't think -- my dad doesn't
ttthink we're going to make it.

tSarah looks at her.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttYour dad is wrong.  About a lot more
ttthan he knows.

tShe puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful.
tThe long march continues.

<b>tUP AT THE FRONT,
</b>
tNICK catches up to ROLAND.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttI think you should call a break.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttAnother half hour.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttSome of them won't make another half
tthour.  We didn't come this far to

tRoland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b><b>ttFIVE MINUTES BREAK!
</b>
tImmediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely
tdrained.

<b>tAT THE REAR OF THE GROUP,
</b>
tDRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttI can't believe you're still angry

</b>ttYou know, it's very easy to criticize
ttthe first person who studies

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttNo, it's easy to criticize sloppy
ttresearch and hasty conclusions.

<b>tNEARBY,
</b>
tMALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're
tstill dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttYou know, even if we do get those
tttapes back, people are going to say
ttit's just another hoax.  Ian
ttMalcolm's alien autopsy.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttMaybe.  Maybe not.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttIan, they will misplace our evidence,

ttmiddle of times Square.

tHe doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
ttThere's something more important that
ttyou should be thinking about instead.

<b>tBEHIND THEM,
</b>
tDr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits
tdown on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something
tbehind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up.

tIt's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled
texterior.  A dinosaur egg.

tBurke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces
tthe egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder.

<b>tAT THE REAR OF THE GROUP,
</b>
tDIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops
tthe pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
tCARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttWait here for me, would ya Carter?

tHe steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around
tthe front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the
theadphone BLARING tinnily in his ears.

tAnd he didn't hear a word.

<b>tEXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY
</b>
tOnly a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth
tso thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws
tforward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself.

tHe clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
thand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we
tdidn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger.

tNothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--

t-- and s SCURRYING around to his left.

tDieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees
tnothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him,
the sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same
tchicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttIt's not polite to --

tHe pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
tit to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
tand dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.

ttttDIETER (cont'd)
tt-- sneak up on people.

tThe wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle,
twhimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
tpaces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out
tinto --

t-- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back
tor forward.

tHe looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he
ttook coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing
twith his hands, retracing his steps.

tHe adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
tthat direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he
tstops again.  Still nothing but jungle.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b><b>ttHEY!  CARTER!  YELL OR SOMETHING, I
</b><b>ttGOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE!
</b>
<b>tON THE TRAIL,
</b>
tDieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear
tenough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in
this ears.

ttttDIETER (o.s.)
tt...Carter... me?...

<b>tIN THE JUNGLE,
</b>
tDieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his
tright.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
tfoliage, moving faster and faster.

tPanicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the
tground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on
this face.

tHe looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten
ttimes louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him.

tDieter GASPS as something rushes in at him.

tHe whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that
tside as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter
tscrambles up into a sitting position --

t-- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now,
tthe same as the one he wounded.

tFor a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings
this gun around, to point it at them.

<b>ttttDIETER
</b>ttEasy -- wait -- one more sec-

tAs one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward,
tcovering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
teach try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely.

tDieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly.
tSome of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off,
tSMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang
ton, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on
tthe ground.

tHysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING,
tshaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic
tseems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and
tdrop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon,
twhich goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six
tfeet from him.

tLosing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse,
tstopping ten yards away from him.

tBut they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up
tand down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING.

tDieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the
tcompys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his
tlost weapon.

tTen feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun.
tHe turns to face the pursuing compys.

tThey stop.

tDieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms.

tThe compys turn and run.  Dieter stops.

tThe compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment
tof quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and
<b>tSQUEALING.
</b>
tDieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away.

tThe compys follow.

<b>tEXT. JUNGLE - DAY
</b>
tFrom the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttBreak's over, move on!

tThe exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
tstart to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps
tCarter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up,
thoists his backpack, and marches away.

tBehind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle
ttrail.

<b>tEXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY
</b>
tDIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a
tstream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the
tstones.  He falls, into the rocky stream.

tBehind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he
tjust crested.  They disappear for a moment, down an incline --

t-- And then swarm over his body.  In a frenzy of splashing,
tDieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
tHe gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  A
tgeyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
tDieter drops out of sight.

tThe compys leap over the log and disappear from view too,
tthrowing up their own splashes of water.  SCREECHING,
tCHIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter's
<b>tSCREAMS.
</b>
tNow, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
twater below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
tare pink.

tAnd then they're a deep, deep red.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

tRoland looks at them, thinking.  Finally:

tThey look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to

tone by one.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK
</b>
tThe column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge,
twhere they are silhouetted against the setting sun.  They're
ttaking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground.

tMALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttYou okay?

tShe doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to
tsit over next to SARAH.

tMalcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and
tmakes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm.

<b>tAT THE RIDGE,
</b>
tROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
tinterior.  From his vantage point, he's able to see all the
tway to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff,
tmiles away.  Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
tgently undulating jungle.

tHe refers to one of the satellite recon photos.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttLooks like the worker village is down
ttin there, about a mile and a half
ttnortheast from the base of these
ttcliffs.

tMALCOLM is next to him.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThere must be a game trail, some kind
ttof path that goes down there.

tRoland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttThey'll have to rest before we look
ttfor it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.
ttThen we hit it.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe group has made camp in the jungle.  The mood is somber,
tmost of the MARCHERS asleep already.  Three or four tents have
tbeen put up.

<b>tIN ONE TENT,
</b>
tKELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up
tto his chest.  SARAH comes in.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttThere you are.  Your dad's looking
ttfor you.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttI doubt that.

tSarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
tthe broad red smear across its front.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttOh, come on.  Go talk to him.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttWhy?  He likes to be alone.  I can
ttstay with you.

<b>tIN THE CAMPSITE,
</b>
tall is still.  The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
tthe sleeping marchers.

tIn his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up.  As if he heard
tsomething.  He looks out the open flap.  In the middle of the
tcampsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked.

tRoland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of
tthe camp.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttYou hear something?

<b>ttttAJAY
</b>ttNo.  I feel something.

tRoland looks at him.  This isn't so good.  He looks out at the
tshifting jungle.  He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
tover the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttOh, no.

<b>tIN SARAH'S TENT,
</b>
tKelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying
tto get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them,
tswaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap.

tAs the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side,
twe notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's
tright -- it's blood.

tThe baby T-rex's blood.

<b>tAT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,
</b>
tthe thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
tthat's been lit by DR. BURKE.

tHe's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS
tthe dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan.

tRoland and Ajay run up behind him.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttt(hisses)
<b>ttARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
</b>
tBurke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire.

<b>tBMBB!
</b>
tRoland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that?

<b>tIN SARAH'S TENT,
</b>
tSarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too.

<b>tBMBB!
</b>
<b>tAT THE COCKING FIRE,
</b>
<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttGet my weapon.

tAjay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold,
tstaring down at the ground.

<b>tBMBB!
</b>
tA recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and
timpact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
tcircles spreading to the outer edges.

<b>tBMBB!
</b>
<b>tIN SARAH'S TENT,
</b>
tSarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
tinto Ziploc bags.

<b>tBMBB!
</b>
tNow they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves,
tand draw the zipper up, all the way around.

tOutside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent.
tSarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last
tfew inches, but --

t-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It
tsniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the
ttent.

tIt sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with
tthe blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur
tGURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.

tIn the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely
tvisible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,
ttrying to figure out what this thing is.

tIt rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and
tthen rises, straights up --

t-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the
tground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
taway, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
tbeneath it.

<b>tIN THE CAMPSITE,
</b>
tthe SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining
tthe first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
tup.  Many of them start to run.

tRoland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon
tlying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous
tT-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep
tinto the mud.

tRoland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked
tHunters flee in all directions.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b><b>ttFOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN!
</b>
tBut they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
tprey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and
till-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes.

<b>tACROSS THE CAMPSITE,
</b>
tNICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
tto get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He
trips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into
tthe jungle.

<b>tIN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD,
</b>
tMALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the
trest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b><b>ttKELLY?  KEEEEELLLY?!
</b>
tBut he can't see her.

<b>tAT THE EDGE OF CAMP,
</b>
tthe two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a
tnarrow ravine.

<b>tUP ON A ROCK RACE,
</b>
tRoland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's
tgoing down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle
tof the camp, start to head for the ravine.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b><b>ttMALCOLM!  OVER HERE!
</b>
tMalcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face,
tscrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders.

tBehind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
tcamp toward him.

ttttROLAND (cont'd)
<b>ttFASTER!!
</b>
tMalcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the
trock face --

t-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

t-- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and
tpulls him up, out of the rex's grasp.

tThe rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear
this teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It
tturns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off
tafter them.

tMalcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland
tunceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.

<b>tIN THE RAVINE,
</b>
tKelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,
thears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and
tRoland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttt(shouting)
<b>ttKELLY, UP HERE!
</b>
tBut Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine
tnow, and drawing closer to the group.

tSome Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the
travine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold
tof a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.

tThe second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
thead left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The
tHunter goes flying forward and crashes into --

t-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest
tof the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the
trex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the
tbottom of it --

t-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
tthe earth.

<b>tUP ON TH ROCK FACE,
</b>
tMalcolm is frantic.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttI gotta get down there!

<b>tDOWN IN THE RAVINE,
</b>
tit's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick
tknows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
tsomething off to his left.

tIt's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock
tface.  But there's something about the way the water is
tfalling that tells him something.

<b>ttttNICK
</b><b>ttSARAH KELLY COME HERE!
</b>
tHe grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight
tat the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into
tthe rock, and he's dragging them along with him.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b><b>ttWHAT ARE YOU-
</b>
<b>ttttNICK
</b><b>ttJUMP!
</b>
tThe three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
tTHROUGH the water.

tDR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as
tthey vanish.

<b>tBEHIND THE WATERFALL,
</b>
tthere is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for.
tIt's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough
tfor him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water.
tBreathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttShhhh... shhhh...

tWith an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the
tcascading water and crashes into them.

tDr. Burke.

<b>ttttBURKE
</b>ttGet out of the way!

tHe pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the
twater as he can.

tFOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain.

tA Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot.

tThe four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right,
tsearching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze
tas far back against the wall as they can get.

tThe rex can't quite get its head all the way through the
topening --

t-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers
tout of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around
tthem, to pull them out of the cave.

tBurke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the
tcave, which pushes Kelly further out.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b><b>ttSTOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP
</b><b>ttIT!
</b>
tBut Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for
thimself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and
ta flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long
teach, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck.

tBurke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing
twater.

tAnd that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its
ttongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
tteeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the
twaterfall, and disappears.

tSarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
twater turn pink.

<b>tUP ON THE ROCK FACE,
</b>
tMalcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
twith Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is
tnearly hysterical.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttShe's okay!  They'll stay in there,
ttshe's okay!

<b>tIN A JUNGLE CLEARING,
</b>
trouted Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
tjungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by
tlong "elephant" grass.

tAJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of
tthe grass, SHOUTING to the others.

<b>ttttAWAY
</b><b>ttNO!  DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS!
</b>
tNot in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous
tshadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding
tup at the edge of the jungle.

tAjay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
tjudgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after
tthe other Hunters, waving his arms.

<b>tUP ABOVE THEM,
</b>
tRoland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
tof the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
tas they plow through the grass.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttElephant grass!

<b>tON THE PLAIN,
</b>
tthe groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass.
tOne of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.

<b>ttttHUNTER
</b>ttThey gave up!  They're not chasing
ttus!

tThere are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S
tVOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up
ton the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his
tarms madly.

tBut in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.
tThey continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get
tfurther away from the tyrannosaurs.

<b>tABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY,
</b>
tthe tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by
tthe full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter
tparty.  The heads descend, back into the grass.

<b>tBACK WITH THE HUNTERS,
</b>
tthey continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four
tmore heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.

tOn all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move
tforward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.

tAnd these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly
tdragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall
tgrass.

tIn his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
tdrops its head to make the kill.

tBehind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more
tanimal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the
tRUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --

t-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.

tVelociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,
tthe second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
tclaw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes
ton attack.

tLike now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
tHunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The
tHunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish
tinto the twitching long grass.

tAnother raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,
tpast the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,
tand takes him down, into the grass.

tBehind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,
trealizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
tgrass.

tAround him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.

tAjay simply closes his eyes.

<b>tUP ON THE ROCK,
</b>
tRoland turns away from the carnage, pained.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT
</b>
tSARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER
tLUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks
tdecimated, spirits shattered.

tRoland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was.
tHe has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or
tless cleaned it, now he's checking the loads.

tKelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it
tdoesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his
tknees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at
tthem, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay."

tRoland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm,
twho has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttHow many rounds did you find for that
ttweapon?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttFour, counting the one in the
ttchamber.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttDon't let it out of your hands again.
ttt(to Sara, but looking at
ttt Kelly)
ttCan the kid walk?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttAsk her.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttCan the kid walk?

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttI can.  I can walk.

tWhile he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the
tservo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow
tyour gaze.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWe're going to find a path down into
ttthe interior of the island.  Load up
ttwhatever you think you need, and I
ttmean need.  If you can't carry it
ttindefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll
tthit the worker village in a couple
tthours and be out of here before dawn.

<b>tAT THE EDGE OF CAMP,
</b>
tRoland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the
trex.  Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up,
tslinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders.

tRoland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint.  It's filled with
ta liquid of some kind.

tHe takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the
tground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling
tit.  Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWhat is that?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttPiss.

tLudlow doesn't ask.

<b>tNOW AT THE FIRE,
</b>
tRoland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
tto such disaster.  He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
tin his pants pocket.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT
</b>
tROLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also
twearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
tcome out in a flattened area.  Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead in
twonderment.  MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage a
tmoment later.  He too stares in amazement.

tSARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON.  One by
tone, they all stop and stare.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttGod help us.

tThey're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at
tthe sides.  The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
tside and as far as they can see ahead.  But that's not what
tamazes them so.

tEverywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons.  Some
tare huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip.
tOthers are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds.  The
tmore intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs
tof pale bone.  but just as many have been ripped apart, bits
tof carcass tossed in every direction.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttI do not feel lucky.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttKeep moving.

tThey march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous
tskeletons by the light of the full moon.  Roland notices one
tcarcass in particular, a recent kill.  It's an enormous
tHADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it.

tHe bends down, studying the soft earth around it for
tfootprints.

<b>tFURTHER ON,
</b>
tMalcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which
tfall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing.

tHe turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones.  But
tthey're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal
tgraveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
tobjects -- twisted, rotting machinery.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWe made it!

tThey hurry over a small rise --

<b>tEXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT
</b>
t-- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
tSorna's worker village.  The size of a football field, the
ttown is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides
tby stores, residences, cafes, a gas station.  All the way at
tthe far end is a large, blocky, four-story building.

tBut the town is a mess.  The hurricane that hit here must have
tbeen ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken,
tupended.  And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing
tup, around, and over everything.  Huge root systems snake
tthrough the street, making it almost impassable.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThe jungle.  It's always ready to
ttreturn.

tRoland catches up and looks at Ludlow.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWhere's the power and radio setup?

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttOperations building.  Far end of the
ttstreet.

tA light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully,
tsilently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.

tThey pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower.  An empty gas
tstation, its vine-snarled pumps now useless.  The only sound
tis the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
tthe group's gazes obediently.

tEvery few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps
tthat lies in random places in the middle of the street.
tMalcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them.  It's a rock-hard.
tNick looks over his shoulder.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttLava?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttWhat are they?

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttI don't know.

tFinally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of
tthe town.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttThe radio rig is inside.  It runs
ttdirectly from the geothermal
ttgenerator, so power shouldn't be a
ttproblem.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttGood.

tHe pulls out his canteen.  Ludlow watches as he screws the top
toff, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the
tcontents on the outside of it.

tThe rest of the group just stares at him.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttWhat's he got in there?

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttPiss.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttDon't ask me.  The guy's completely
ttout to lunch.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttWhat in God's name would he want
ttwith-

tRoland rejoins them.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttTyrannosaur urine.  I don't want
ttanything to do with it, and neither
ttdoes any other animal on this island.
ttThis building is now demarcated as
ttthe rex's territory.  As long as you 
ttstay in that building, you'll all be
ttsafe until the helicopter comes.

tHe drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks
tthe load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful.

<b>ttttJUTTSON
</b>ttWhere are you going?

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttAfter the rex.  I saw a fresh kill
ttback in the valley with tyrannosaur
tttracks all around it.  If I'm not
ttback in time, don't wait for me.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttYou've got to be kidding.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttRuns against my nature to hole up in

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttDo you think the rex might have the

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttPossible.

tLudlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttYou know how to work a radio, don't
ttyou?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttYou're going too?

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttI lost everything I came after on
ttthis trip, but one T-rex in one theme

ttInGen out of Chapter 11.

tHe takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
tto Nick.

ttttLUDLOW (cont'd)
ttThis is the broadcast frequency.  ID
ttyourself as "Harvest Leader."  You
ttknow what to tell 'em.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttYou gentlemen feel you have to do

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttNow's the perfect time.  The animal

tLudlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --

ttttNICK (cont'd)
ttOnly humans do.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

</b>
tThe console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttt(into microphone)
ttCQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation
ttHarvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come

tThe remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
tflashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
tcommunications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says
t"We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle
tof vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.

tOn one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
tPark would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
ttourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
tat the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came
ttrue, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.

tThere is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks
tat Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the
tradio, clean as can be.

ttttVOICE (o.s.)
ttGo ahead, Harvest Leader.

tThey all breath a sign of relief.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tWith Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
tgroup inside the operations building, main street stands
tdeserted and silent.

tNearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
tend of the street --

t-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT
</b>
tROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing
tamid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends
tdown, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
tsaw earlier.

tA set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
tcarcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow
tfollows Roland.

tAs they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the
tsurface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,
twashing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with
this eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the
tsound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.

tHe reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
tfrom the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
tthat on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,
tthen blow back at him.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWe're downwind.  Good.

tRoland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to
this lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the
tshore.  Ludlow follows.

tThey creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend
tand Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.

tOver the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards
tahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a
tbird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,
tto let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at
tthe water as well, drinking.

tRoland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off."

tLudlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he
tputs his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the
tmiddle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,
teyes blazing.

tOut in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
twell, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since
tRoland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's
treaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.

tRoland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.

<b>tFURTHER ON,
</b>
tthe trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.
tRoland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.
tRoland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.

tTo the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.
tA short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,
tgreen, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and
tWHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWe took to the rock.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttWhy?

tIn front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night
tbreeze.  Roland's eyes widen.  He pulls out another pinch of
tcampfire ash and releases it on the wind.

tThis time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttWind shift.

tThey freeze, terrified.  Behind them, the enormous green
tpebbled boulder --

t-- opens an eye.

tThat's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standing
trock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the
tsurrounding foliage perfectly.  Very slowly and almost
tsilently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it
tis staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.

tRoland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,
tunaware of its presence.

tUntil it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite
taudible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
tever so slightly.

tTheir hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his
tvoice a queasy HISS.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttIt's... behind... us.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttt(the very softest whisper)
ttIt's just fed.  It won't attack unless
ttit's threatened.  Don't move.

tAs the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from
tthese intruders, it breathes again.  A few strands of Ludlow's
thair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.

tHe can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon
the holds in his hands.  Unfortunately, it's extended in front
tof him, away from the rex.

tHe risks another HISS.

<b>ttttLUDLOW
</b>ttIf I don't move, I can't shoot it.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttLet it go, Peter.  The animal won.

tBehind them, the rex appears satisfied.  It starts to swing
tits massive head around, back toward the jungle.  It lifts one
tgreat leg and takes a step into the trees.

tRoland signs and closes his eyes, relieved.

tBut Ludlow seizes the opportunity.  He whips his weapon around
tand drops to one knee.

ttttROLAND (cont'd)
<b>ttNO!
</b>
tThe rex is infinitely quicker.  Ludlow just has time to
tsqueeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
tanimal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES.

tLudlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
tthe rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down,
tjaws wide.  They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight
tup into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so
tit is firmly around his midsection.

tThe whole combination of movements takes but half a second.
tBy the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and
tdarted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING
tand writhing in its mouth.

tRoland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but
tthrough the shivering trees, he can only see that the
ttyrannosaur is gone.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:

<b>tINT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tMALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
tthe communications room.  An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
ton one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.  They look over at
tit, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
tformica counter.

tOther objects in the lab begin to rattle too.  Glass jars
tCLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
tshelves, a stool shudders across the floor.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b>ttWhat's going on?!

tAbove them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
tactually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
tthe night.  They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --

t-- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!

tAs the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
tviolent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
theads.

<b>tINT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
</b>
tUp above the operations building, the helicopter circles.  The
troof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
timpossible to land open.

tBelow, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
tthe building.  They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
tpiercing the night sky.

<b>ttttPILOT
</b>ttThere they are!

tThe Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
toverturned cars and fallen trees.

<b>ttttCO-PILOT
</b>ttNo LZ in the street, too much debris!

<b>ttttPILOT
</b>ttCheck the other buildings!

tThe Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
tthe village.

tAt the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
tsearchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
tbuilding.

tThe Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.

<b>tEXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tMALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out
tthe front of the operations building.  At the end of the
tstreet, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
tthe building, to land on its roof.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThere it is!

tHappily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for
tthe chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are
teverywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if
tthey once dripped there and then turned to stone.

tThis time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
tof a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought
toccurs to her.

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttIan.  It's guano.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttThese formations.  They're dried --

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttBirdshit?

tA VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them.

tThey don't see it.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttWho cares?  Let's go!

tUnaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot
ttoward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and
tSNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
thelicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance
tbetween them quickly.

tThe animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group,
tand takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the
tothers, who fall like dominoes.

tJuttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL,
tas the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him.

tSarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a
tSECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed.
tShe buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her
thands --

t-- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her
tlegs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the
tfirst raptor in the kill.

tPanicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps
tup and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits
tthe dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
troad.

tMalcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's
tgone now.  He looks around frantically.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttKelly?!  KELLY?!

tSarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
tnearest her.

tBehind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her
twith horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is
tnothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly.

tThe walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah,
tand as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
ther, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an
tabandoned car.

tBut the car door is thin protection against the charging
traptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window
tspinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the
tground.

tSarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the
tweb.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
tinto the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it.

tSarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
tthe hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face.

tShe hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
tanimal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso
twill not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away.

tIn the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news.

tThere's no windshield.

tThe raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on
tthe sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening --

t-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor
tstruggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the
tnearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden
tdoor.

<b>tEXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</b>
tMALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
tstation building, closing the door behind him.  A moment
tlater, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door.

tMeeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass
twindow next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window
tSHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside,
tits tail hanging out.

tJust as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back
tout, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the
tLindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

t-- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside,
tthrough the door again.

tWilling to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the
twindow again.

<b>tINT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

tBalancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
tready to spring at Malcolm.

tMalcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
tbetween them.  He raises the rifle.

tTh raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
tknocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.

tBut the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
tpreventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.

tFor the moment.

<b>tEXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

tMalcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground.
tHe GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted
tunnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun.

tROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to
this feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the
tcommotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
tthe street, spilling some of the precious videotapes.

tMalcolm scoops them up.

<b>tINT. KILN HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tHigh above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
tstory kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
tand other construction projects.  Catwalks lined with heavy
tchains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
tcircles, wondering what to do now.

tFrom outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
tsounds.  From the other side of the door comes an animal
tSNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
tthe crack along the ground.

<b>tON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR,
</b>
tthe claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
ttunnel underneath.

<b>tINSIDE,
</b>
tSarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
tstarts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
tganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
tit.

tSarah digs faster.  So does the raptor.

tWith about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
thold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
thard as she can.  It snaps off with a loud CRACK.

tAt the door, the raptor stops digging.  It's silent for a
tmoment.

tSarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
tShe starts to lower her body into it --

<b>t-- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER
</b><b>tSIDE!
</b>
tSarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
tgrabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.  She starts to
tclimb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
tits way inside, coming in through her hole.

tSarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
tanother.

tThe raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.

tapproach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the
tstreet --

t-- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.  Its claws CLACK on the
troof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.

tThey don't stick around to negotiate.  Nick hauls Malcolm off
tinto the nearest building.

<b>tINT. WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
tNICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
tThey're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
tprobably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
tspend the night.  The room and staircase wind around a large,
topen-aired central area four stories tall.  They SHOUT at each

tWith a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
tswings open violently.  Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
ton the floor.

tA VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.  Nick throws his
tweight against the door.  SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.

tMalcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.

tSLAM!  The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
tit off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.  The
traptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.

tMalcolm swings the gun around --

t-- the raptor lunges at him --

t-- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --

t-- and the raptor lands on top of him.

tThe weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
tgun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down
thard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
tits head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.

tMalcolm pulls the trigger.

tThe raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
tits throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
tviolently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his

tonly three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in
tthe lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttIt's too wide!

tNick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans
tagainst the building they're standing on, its lines gone
tslack.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttHelp me push this!

tMalcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
tpole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other
tdirection.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far
tbuilding, THUDDING against it solidly.

tIts power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to
tthe next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
tthe gap, hand over hand.

tBehind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
topen as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps
tonto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
thimself across.

tBut even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side
thesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out
tonto the roof.

<b>tON THE OTHER ROOFTOP,

tback at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto
tthe roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.

<b>ttttNICK
</b>ttIt's afraid to come onto the roof!

tSARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she
treaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof
tof the next building.

tShe lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
tsloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --

t-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full
tstride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof
tahead of her.

tSarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,
taway from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her
tSPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section
tpulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to
tit, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.

tShe looks over her shoulder, down --

t-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the
tbuilding below.

tSarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which
tkeeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in
ttime to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.

tSarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and
tnails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all
tthe way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles
tthere, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.

tThe raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,
tat her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its
tjumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.

tDesperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
tand hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the
thead, for all the good that does.

tBut Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She
tedges to the right, toward a fresh supply.

tThe raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the
tslick roof.

tSomething interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose
ttiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.
tSarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the
tway as fast as she can.

tSuddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
tfooting underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The
tanimal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid
tthe tumbling tiles.

tSarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,
thugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the
troof, right past her --

t-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and
tattack one another.

tNow Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next
tto the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.
tShe GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue
tto thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out
tof their way --

t-- and plunges through a hole in the roof.

tEyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the
tstreet below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top
tspeed down the middle of the street --

<b>t-- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM.
</b>
<b>tDOWN IN THE STREET,
</b>
tMalcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
tThey're pretty fast, but it's faster.

tAbove them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,
tSHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster.

tThey reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of
tstruts and metal poles that Sarah climbed.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b><b>ttCLIMB!
</b>
tKelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles,
tpulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
tnext one.

tMalcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's
tmuch harder.

tBelow them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts,
tshaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up.

tHigher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.
tShe breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs
ton a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,
trunning the balance beam.

tShe reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and
tlooks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,
tbreathing hard.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b><b>ttDAD, COME ON!
</b>
tBelow him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the
tbeam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he
tdoesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did.

tThe raptor draws closer.

ttttKELLY (cont'd)
<b>ttFASTER!
</b>
tMalcolm slips.

tOne foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing,
ttrying to regain his tenuous balance.

tBut he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from
tunder him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,
tknocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off
tthe bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.

tHe drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to
ta halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably
tcracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.

ttttKELLY (cont'd)
<b>ttDAD!
</b>
tShe stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among
tthe bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
tfeet above him now, with an open attack route.

tThe animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.

tUp above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
tand leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.

tThe raptor springs.

tKelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very
tpeak of her trajectory, she lets go.

tThe raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING
tboth of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it
thurtling into space.

tShe lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery
tscaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
tground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on.

<b>ttttKELLY
</b><b>ttGET UP!
</b>
tShe grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet.

<b>tON THE ROOF,
</b>
tKelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS
tfrom inside.

<b>ttttPILOT
</b><b>ttLET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!!
</b>
tMalcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the
topposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the
tedge as well.

tMalcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the
tanimal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five,
tthey're surely done for this time, when --

<b>t-- KA-BOOM!
</b>
tThere comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,
tand the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
tthe roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the
tgunshot.

tIt's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his
tsmoking .600 Nitro Express.

tBut there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the
thelicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
troof.

<b>ttttPILOT
</b><b>ttHURRY!  THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY!
</b>
tThe skid dips even further, ripping right through the
tthatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the
thelicopter, loses her balance --

t-- as the roof caves in beneath her.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b><b>ttKELLY!
</b>
tShe falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the
tbuilding below.

<b>tONE FLOOR DOWN,
</b>
tKelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
troof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by
tan inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
tarranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous
tsubstance drips off of it.

tIt's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large,
toblong shapes.  Eggs.

tAbove her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through
tthe wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttKelly!  I'm coming!

tKelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape
tis moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way.

<b>tIT'S A PTERANODON.
</b>
tYep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a
tbrilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long,
tsaber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only
tstare, spellbound.

tMalcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
tits massive twenty-two foot wingspread.

<b>tON THE ROOF,
</b>
tthe helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
troof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris.
tRoland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and
tstarts kicking at it, making it larger.

<b>ttttROLAND
</b>ttGive me a ladder!

<b>tIN THE PTERANODON NEST,
</b>
tMalcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a
tSECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building,
tSCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
tmiddle of their clutch of eggs.

tAn emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof.
tMalcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
tand they start to climb out of the nest.

<b>tON THE ROOF,
</b>
tMalcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
tbelly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
tthrough the surface of the roof around them.

tThe pteranodons are emerging.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b><b>ttGO GO GO GO GOG GO!
</b>
tThe helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an
tabrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers
tthere.

<b>ttttPILOT
</b>ttWe're snagged on something!

tThey loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
thole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
thelicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and
tdrag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest --

t-- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly.

<b>tIN THE HELICOPTER,
</b>
tthe PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to
tthe helicopter.

<b>ttttPILOT
</b>ttHang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut
tt'em with the rotors!

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>ttNO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

tThey look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent
tanimals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the
tchopper gains altitude.

ttttSARAH (cont'd)
ttThey're protecting their nest.
ttThat's all.  That's all they're
ttdoing.

tKelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm,
teach of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags
tagainst her father's chest, nothing left.

tHe holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank
ttGod for you...

<b>tIN THE NIGHT SKY,
</b>
tover the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude.  A
thundred feet.  Three hundred.  A thousand.

tAs the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the
tpteranodons now peel off, their job done.  One of them banks
tsharply, right in front of the moon.  The moonlight
tsilhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings,
tlighting it up like a Halloween skeleton.

tBelow, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
tthe wine-dark sea.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT
</b>
tElsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story.  PETER
tLUDLOW, still alive, drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
tmuddy ground.  Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him,
the opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud.

tFrom behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns.

tHe's in the tyrannosaur nest.

tThe BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange
taluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with
texcitement as it toddles toward him.

tLudlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT
tTYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him.

tThe baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away.

tBut in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking
tLudlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again.
tWatching.  Waiting.

tLudlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex
tstrikes, knocking him over again.

tLudlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down
tand closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it
ttightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS --

t-- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a
tdry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby
ttoddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
tup, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide.

tPeter Ludlow SCREAMS.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
tSnow falls in a gray midwinter sky.  In a cemetery, a group of
tfifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
tthat is festooned with cascades of flowers.  On a table, there
tis an array of framed photographs --

t-- of JOHN HAMMOND.  A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
tMourners wipe away tears.  IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
tdistance from the group, KELLY right beside him.  Malcolm's
tface is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white
twinter setting around him.

tAt gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her
tshoulder.  About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair
tand an honest, open face.  She notices Malcolm, recognizes
thim.

tShe nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old.
tThe Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming.

tAs the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttHello, Lex.  Tim.

tLEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek.
tTIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.

ttttMALCOLM (cont'd)
ttThis is Kelly.  My daughter.

tThey nod their hellos.

<b>ttttLEX
</b>ttI'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttI'm sorry about your grandfather.

<b>ttttTIM
</b>ttThank you.

<b>ttttLEX
</b>ttWe were going to call you, in a few
ttdays.  Tim and I have been thinking,
ttand we've decided we want people to
ttknow about the island.  About what we
ttall saw.

<b>ttttTIM
</b>ttWe think it's something our
ttgrandfather would want us to do.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttt(pause)
ttWhy?

<b>ttttLEX
</b>ttBecause it's true.

tMalcolm looks at her for a long moment.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttI know, Lex.  But even if we're the
ttonly ones who ever know, it'll still
ttbe true.  You see, I've decided
ttthat if the world found out about
ttwhat your grandfather created, it
ttwouldn't be around for very long.

<b>ttttLEX
</b>ttBut -- it was real.  You can't let
ttpeople go on saying it's not.

<b>ttttMALCOLM
</b>ttThat's the thing about reality.

tHe looks down at Kelly.

ttttMALCOLM (cont'd)
ttEven when people stop believing in
ttit, it doesn't go away.

tKelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers
tinterlocking with his.

<b>tEXT. JUNGLE - DAY
</b>
tBack on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village,
tmoving lightly, as in a dream.

<b>ttttMALCOLM (V.O.)
</b>ttDo you feel the cold wind blowing on
ttyour face?  That's real.

tWe sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took off
tfrom, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
tscrap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.

<b>ttttMALCOLM (V.O.)
</b>ttDo you see the four of us, standing
tthere together, alive?  That's real.

tA PTERANODON land gently on the nest.  Ever so carefully, it
tpositions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting
tposition, and folds its giant wings around its body.

<b>ttttMALCOLM (V.O.)
</b>ttAnd maybe that's still that matters.

tThe animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWKS
tapprovingly up at the heavens.
