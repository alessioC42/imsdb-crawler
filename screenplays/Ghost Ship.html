<b>ttttttt FADE IN
</b>
<b>tINT. BARGE - DAY
</b>
tCrewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
tdown into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
toily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
tand WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

<b>tINT. BARGE - LATER - DAY
</b>
tEpps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
ton a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
tkneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
tin through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

<b>tEXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY
</b>
tEpps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
trusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
tby a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
tIt is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
tmeans a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
twest.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
tforward.

<b>tEXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
tUp ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
tsmoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

tEpps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
tprofessional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
tNorthwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
ttrue calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
tand a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
tconsidered pretty.

tShe clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
tto a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
tthe cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
tbow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
tthat fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
tthe tug at the other end.

<b>tEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY
</b>
tDODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
tname "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
t(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
tcoveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
tTexan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
tfirst mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
tred-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
tnorth.

tThey watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
toccasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
tpassing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
twhere the cable winds into a tow anchor.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttIt's a slow leak.

tShe unclips and drops to the deck.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttWhat's slow?

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttMaybe twenty gallons an hour.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttWhere from?

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttAmidships starboard at the beam.  
ttJust under the waterline. I don't 
ttthink it's a problem.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttHear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
ttit's a problem.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttI'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

<b>tINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tThe view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
tand GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
tpilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
tmost of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
tevery crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
tbet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

<b>ttttGREER (V.O. RADIO)
</b>ttGreer to Murphy.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttt(lifting the radio)
ttGo.

tMurphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
tat him from the stern.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttThe number nine on the starboard 
ttside's half flooded. Epps says it's 
tta slow leak just under the waterline, 
ttabout twenty gallons an hour. They 
ttmust've pumped it before we left 
ttSitka.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttOf course they did.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttLet the buyer beware.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttWhat do you say, Dodge?

<b>ttttDODGE (V.O. RADIO)
</b>ttt(taking the radio)
ttIf it started out at twenty an hour 
ttthe piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
ttof the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
ttmake St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

<b>tEXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY
</b>
tHIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
tthe swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY
</b>
tThe shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
ttown of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
tapproaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
tside as it moves into the harbor.

<b>tEXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY
</b>
tA smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
tlisting barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
ther up.

<b>tINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
tGreer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
tturbines.

<b>tEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tMurphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
tRussian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
torange coveralls approach from the dock.

<b>ttttVASILI
</b>ttI thought you say Tuesday.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttBetter late than never.

<b>ttttVASILI
</b>ttt(seeing the listing 
tttbarge)
ttWhat's this?

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttYou got a leak in the number nine 
ttcompartment.

<b>ttttVASILI
</b>ttNo, no. You got leak.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttYou pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
ttshe'll be good as new.

<b>ttttVASILI
</b>ttThat cost me twenty grand at least.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttFifteen, at the most.

<b>ttttVASILI
</b>ttTwenty. You knock off twenty and 
ttthen we see. After my guy looks at 
ttit.

<b>tINT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tIn a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
ta check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
tbook, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttYou're kidding, right?

<b>ttttVASILI
</b>ttYou want fair pay, make hamburger 
ttfor Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
ttsign.

tVasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

<b>tEXT. SHIPYARD - DAY
</b>
tGreer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttNot bad for dragging a leaky tub 
tthalf way to Russia.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttHe'll sell the scrap for three times 
ttwhat he paid.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttI must be in the wrong business.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttYou got that right.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttt(imitating Vasili)
ttBetter than "making hamburger for 
ttMickey D."

<b>tINT. BAR - NIGHT
</b>
tA typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
tthe middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
tpool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
ttattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
ta paper near-by.

tMurphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
tand a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
tname on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
tof hundreds.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttMuch obliged, skipper.

<b>tINT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT
</b>
tThe place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
tway through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
tShe buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
tof cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
tyoung off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
tlaugh.

<b>tAT A TABLE
</b>
tBeers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
tDodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
tis showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttLooks like Epps' gonna get some 
tttonight.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttWith that coxswain dickhead.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttYou aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttAre you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
ttGimme a break.

tGreer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttWhat a laugh.

tA MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

<b>ttttWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>ttI'll show you, bitch!

tThey look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
t20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

<b>ttttGIRLFRIEND
</b>ttYou want to mess with me, I'll kick 
ttyour bitch ass, girl.

<b>tWITH EPPS
</b>
tEpps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
taround her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttI don't know what you're talking 
ttabout. I just bought this guy a beer.

<b>ttttGIRLFRIEND
</b>ttThis "guy" is my man, honey.

<b>ttttCOASTGUARDSMAN
</b>ttDarlene --

<b>ttttGIRLFRIEND
</b>ttYou, shut up.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttt(starting off)
ttListen, I don't want any trouble, 
ttokay -- ?

<b>ttttGIRLFRIEND
</b>ttt(stopping Epps)
ttUh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
ttnow.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttt(stepping up)
ttWhat seems to be the trouble, ladies?

<b>ttttRIVETER
</b>ttWhyn't you mind your own business, 
ttchief.

tMurphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
tbeer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
tto Epps and the Girlfriend.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttAs I said, what seems to be the 
tttrouble?

<b>ttttRIVETER
</b>ttDidn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
ttgot your hearing aid turned down?

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttI heard you. But I'm choosing to 
ttignore you. Epps, let's go.

tEpps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
tMurphy by the collar.

<b>ttttRIVETER
</b>ttThese ladies was having themselves a 
ttdiscussion and you're interrupting 
ttit.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttYou got about two seconds to get 
ttyour paws off me, Tarzan.

<b>ttttRIVETER
</b>ttOr what?

tOr WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
tin two over the Riveter's head.

tDodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
the still holds, shaking his head.

tThe Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
tbuckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
tsome of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttEpps?

tHe looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
tgrabs her coat.

<b>ttttCOASTGUARDSMAN
</b>ttWait.

tEpps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
tgirlfriend.

<b>ttttCOASTGUARDSMAN
</b>ttDarlene. It's over.

tHe gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
tas the others look on.

<b>ttttCOASTGUARDSMAN
</b>ttI don't love you anymore.

tDarlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
ton the back.

<b>ttttCOASTGUARDSMAN
</b>ttt(to Epps)
ttCome on, Candy. Let's get out of 
tthere.

tThe Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
tand the others as he leads her out.

<b>tEXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY
</b>
tMurphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
tapproaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
tin her step and a song in her heart.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttMorning everybody.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttShow your tatoos to that coxswain 
ttlast night, did you Epps?

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttShowed him a hell of a lot more than 
ttthat.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttI bet you did.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttCandy?

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttIt's my pen name.

<b>tINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
tMurphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from 
tthe dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttRed sky at night, sailor's delight.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttRed sky in morning, sailor take 
ttwarning.

<b>tEXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tAs the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising 
tunder a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.

<b>tttttt DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
tDodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttFuck it.

tHe puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
tcigarette, collecting her winnings.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttOne more?

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttWhy not.

tShe gathers the cards, shuffles.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttWhat is your first name?

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttIt just occurred to me I don't know 
ttyour first name. All this time and I 
ttdon't know it.

tShe deals the cards in silence.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttt(finally)
ttMaureen.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttMaureen.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttMaureen?

tShe looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttWhat's yours?

tDodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttRoger.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttRoger?

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttYeah.

tShe wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttYou think that's funny

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttt(lying)
ttNo.

tShe takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

<b>tEXT. OPEN OCEAN - BERING SEA - NIGHT
</b>
tTHE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward 
tthrough a steady chop and a mild swell.

<b>tINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked 
tas he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks 
tthe radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and 
tpicks up a walkie-talkie.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttt(into walkie)
ttGreer to Murphy.

tGreer studies the radar display as he waits.

<b>ttttMURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttThere's a large vessel out about ten 
ttmiles to the north-west.

<b>tINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</b>
tMurphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his 
tradio.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttI been watching it for close to an 
tthour and it hasn't moved. I can't 
ttraise it on the radio either. Makes 
ttme think it might be in trouble.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttAlright. I'll be right up.

tstanding back.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttThis is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey

tOnly the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttLooks like it's adrift.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttCould be a fishing boat.

<b>ttttGREER
</b>ttToo big. More like a freighter.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttWhat the hell would a freighter be

</b>ttSmuggling what? Tundra grass?

tA beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.

tilluminating the water in front of the boat.

<b>tINT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

tAs the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight 
tover the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

</b>
tThey peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, 
twhen a shadow looms into view.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttWhoa, whoa.

tGreer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow 
tlooms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

tAs they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting 
tbow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness 
tabove them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of 
twhat appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come 
taround, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor 
talleys.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>tt"Chimera."

tMurphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttChimera.

</b>
tMurphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps 
tjumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the 
tsuperstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, 
tlending a still darker ominousness to it.

<b>tEXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</b>
tMurphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights 
tas they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything 
tseems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no 
tapparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her 
tlight down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

<b>tINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

tMurphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in 
there are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

ttProbably a lot longer.

tThey top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which 
ttakes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them, 
trevealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen

tA pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry

tlipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.  
tAnd, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY

tcoming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see 
tis an ancient grandfather clock.

tthe depths of the ship.

tFinally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
tapparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
tloading palettes.

tIn the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
tcomes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to

tEpps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
tlight inside.

tA clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
tshadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
tswings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
tbetween broken wood slats.

tEpps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
tyellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
tsome of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
tingot of gold.

tShe reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
tyears. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
tof gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
taway a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
tsee that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
tand five feet across.

tSOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

tAs Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
tsomewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

tWhere the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
tcontinues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
tinto the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

tShe turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
tNothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
ther heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
techoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
tthe line of burners. Nothing moves.

tEpps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
twatertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
therself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
tTHE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

tShe moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
ther light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
tcompartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
tcloser. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
tmachinery and a stack of oil drums.

tShe approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
tBOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

tShe tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
tas she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
tmetallic and staccato.

tShe stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
thave toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
ther hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
tthe bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
tthrough the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
tbetrays a throughway to the outside.

tThe BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
toil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
tfire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
tpush a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
tShe fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
tthe steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
tflapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large

tShe wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
twhen she smells something really awful.

tShe steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
ttoppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
tof her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
ton the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
truns up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
tscavenging birds.

tShe hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
tsomething. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
tfront of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
twide, unseeing eyes.

tIt takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
ther light back to the headless torso.

tShe shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
tsteam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
tblood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
ther, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

tShe spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
tone hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
tpipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
tto mouth.

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttSo. I got a question. Just from a,

ttWe call the Coastguard.  Coastguard

</b>ttHow do you mean?

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttWell, they're gonna be asking a lot

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttI guess the best strategy's just to

</b>ttYeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
ttWhen there's more than a few hundred

</b>ttWhat do you propose?

<b>ttttDODGE
</b>ttFor starters, getting that gold off 
ttthe ship. What they don't know about 
ttisn't gonna bother them.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttThere's no way we're gonna hide a 
ttfew thousand pounds of gold from the 
ttCoastguard here. Besides, it'll be

</b>ttDid you?

</b>ttHell no. You think I'm crazy?

tAnother beat as they hold there.

</b>ttRegardless of how it happened, there

tthat his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

</b>
tDodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
tlooks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

tHe begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
tyanking them loose, breaking them off.

<b>tINT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
tassortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

tA tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten

tthat it is the ship's log.

tMurphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the

tstarting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
tand the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
tfilling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a

tThe tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
twith seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
tgear to the crane.

tWater is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
ttowering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
tprecariously at the bow of the Chimera.

tMurphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

<b>ttttMURPHY
</b>ttDodge!

tEpps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
tthen Murphy.

tDodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
twhich now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

<b>tWITH DODGE
</b>
tDodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
tgoes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
tstarboard rail.

tHe pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
topens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
tpull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
tand edges his way toward the bow.

<b>tWITH THE OTHERS
</b>
tEpps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
tskewed deck crane.

<b>tWITH DODGE
</b>
tThe tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
tthe top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

tBelow, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
tsinks lower and lower.

<b>tWITH THE OTHERS
</b>
tThey look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
tpulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

tGreer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

<b>tWITH DODGE
</b>
tAs Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
tother side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

tAbove, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
tas the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
tfro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
tclose but not close enough.

tThe swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
tDodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
tcoaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
tthe crane sways back with the foundering boat.

tThe crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
tby the line from the bow of the Chimera.

<b>tWITH THE OTHERS
</b>
tMurphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
tand the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

tDodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
tstill further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
tslipping lower and lower.

<b>tWITH DODGE
</b>
tAs he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
twell on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
tDodge's hand.

tA SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
tcoming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
tChimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

tWith a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
tthe Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
tstarts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
tcable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

tDodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

tA LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
tescaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
tforces it out of the tug below decks.

tThe tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
tas Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

tMurphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
thands barely reaching.

tThe tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
tscrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
tlike a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
teverything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

tMurphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
thand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
<b>tSICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.
</b>
tDodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
tslowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
tof misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
tslipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
tdisappearing altogether into the depths.

tA long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
tbubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

</b>ttYou shouldn't be down here alone.

tto the swimming pool. She walks on.

tthe ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
tShe holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
tGIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

tEpps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
tporcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
tclothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttYou must leave.

tA beat as Epps stands there.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttt(finally)
ttWho are you?

tFrom this distance and in the light it is hard to fully

</b>ttThere's great evil here, more than

ttnever leave.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttBut --

tA HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
tWhen she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
tECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
tnow very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
tdepths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
tup from the bottom.

tShe steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
ttop. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
tthe water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
tthe surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
tglow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

tAs she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
tspreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
tthat the water is not water at all but blood.

tAnd, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
tilluminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
tEpps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
tis a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
tbubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

tEpps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
tpoint, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
tanother, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
tto reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttMy God....

tEpps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
tblood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
tapart.

tShe struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
tsurface.

tThe others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
tout, near tears, helpless to do anything.

<b>ttttEPPS
</b>ttNo!!

tEverything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

tThe blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
tits normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
ton in disbelief.

<b>ttttMURPHY (O.S.)

tEpps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

tThe SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
troom. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
tit is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
tarms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
the expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
tbetween a night terror and a seizure.

<b>tINT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

tShe goes through them, coming to a section that says 
<b>t"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

tto another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
tKatherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment:

tShe opens it.

tThe door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
tspacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
troom in the front, is a bedroom.

tEpps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

tA large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
tfoot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
tprocess of being unpacked.

tFrom one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
tcontains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

tAcross the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
tan Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
tfew shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
tof the books, opening it.

tInscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
tto:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

tA page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
tchildren's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
ta rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
tdoo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
tknow, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
twhistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

tShe opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
tof a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
tmother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
tgirl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool,

tplays "Daisy."

tlooking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
tA beat.

tThe dirty white light falling into the room through the

tturns to see her.

thard.

tand silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
tchoking her.

tHe backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
tthe rest of the way.

tHer hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
tbasket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
ta little out of reach.

tShe is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
ther.

tHer hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

tShe raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
twith Greer's head.

tdazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
the dives, taking her down.

traises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

tEpps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
tand he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
twith his other hand.

tShe swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the

tthe floor.

tShe lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
tbleeding.

tHe unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
twaist to do God knows what.

tEpps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
tshe has unhinged her gill knife.

tAs his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
twith all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through

tofficers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

tThe repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
tbetween the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
tthe bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
tthe bed rocking, the others looking on.

tbreech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

tKatie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
tback at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
tlight of the surface.

<b>tEXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</b>
tEpps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
tChimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
tawash.

<b>tINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tMurphy staggers through the flooded passage.

<b>tEXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tThe Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
tand the stern beginning to rise.

tEpps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
tswimming toward it.

<b>tINT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tWater runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
ttop.

<b>tEXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tEpps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

<b>tINT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tA river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
tdifficulty.

<b>tEXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tEpps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
tup.

<b>tEXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tWater rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
tdeck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
tas he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
tportion rising above him as the bow sinks.

<b>tEXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY
</b>
tEpps collapses on the rocks.

<b>tEXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tAs the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
tmomentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
tsmoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
tcurrent from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

<b>tEXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY
</b>
tEpps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

<b>tEXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tAs the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
tpulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
tis pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
tsmokestack's opening.

tThe ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
tthe stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
twithout success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
tstack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
twater.

<b>tEXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY
</b>
tEpps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
tat the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
tgoes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

tShe turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
tChimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
tand waves her arms.

<b>tEXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY
</b>
tThe Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
tdropping a survival pack.

tThe Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
tnow, slipping further and further under.

tEpps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

<b>tEXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
tThe afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
tCAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
tthen slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
tMOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
tthere is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
tocean.
