                             THIRD REWRITE   August 24, 1994


tTwo men bolt recklessly through a downtown street. Hunters
thot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle.


tThe sidewalk is crowded with people. So is the street. Too
tmany people, not enough cement. Los Angeles, 1997.


tSummer, probably August. 103 degrees. Heat shimmers off the
thorizon. Making the sky look peculiar.


tThe men keep running. Passed a GUY sitting at a bus stop,
twatching a television in his lap. YOU HEAR the NEWSCASTER.


<b>ttttNEWSCASTER (V. 0.) 
</b>ttAs L. A. P. D. officers gather
ttevidence at this grisly crime
ttscene, you can only ask yourselves
ttx97x97 what kind of lunatic would
ttcommit such unthinkable crimes?
ttt(a beat)
ttThe three adjectives which best
ttdescribe this killer are sadistic,
ttintelligent, and dangerous...

tThe guy pays little attention to the broadcast. He seems
talmost bored by it. Like this kind of news is commonplace. Or
the's got more important things on his mind.

tEverybody is sweating. Including the two men struggling to
tswim upstream in the river of pedestrians.

tTheir uniforms are freshly pressed. Their shoes just recently
tshined. Hair tightly cropped. Faces perfectly shaved. Clearly
tmen proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police
tDepartment. The guy in the lead is

<b>ttttPARKER BARNES
</b>ttHis body is a running back's. His
ttendurance a marathoner's. His face
ttone you'd want for your own. He's
ttin his 30s. If he was in his 20s,
ttyou'd still be jealous.

tHis partner is JOHN DONLEY, late 20s, eager to prove himself.
tHe struggles to keep up with Parker. John accidently knocks
tover several pedestrians. They give no reaction, except to
tpick themselves up and continue on their way.

tParker and John keep charging. Their conversation breathless:

<b>ttttJOHN
</b>ttI can't get over how different you
ttlook.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(ruefully)
ttFive years can be a bitch, huh?

tThey split-up. The Maitre D', still facing the front doors,
trepeats his greeting to no one in particular.

<b>ttttMAITRE D'
</b>ttGood afternoon. May I help you?

tParker spots Sid 6.7 across the room. Without hesitation the
thunter chases his prey.  Gun out and firing. NOT what you
twould call Standard Police Procedure.

tBullets riddle Sid 6.7's table as he dives from his chair. He
tlands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath his
ttable.

tJohn charges from the other direction until a WOMAN gets up
tfrom her chair, standing directly in John's line of fire.

<b>ttttJOHN
</b>ttt(to the Woman)
ttLady, move!

tBefore she can do so, Sid 6.7 stands behind the Woman,
tgrabbing her and throwing her across the table into Parker.
tCRASH! They tumble to the floor.

tIn the same movement, Sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his
tjacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire.
tJohn's gun flies from his hand. Sid 6.7 advances toward him.

tParker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does
tthe same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet
tthrough his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's.
tParker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp.

tParker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in
tthe stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in
tthe background. Parker doubles over, gasping for breath.
tAnother kick drops Parker to his knees.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(to Parker)
ttI'm going to rehearse with your
ttfriend a while, then I'll be back
ttto perform a new piece with you.

tHe grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head,
tknocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over
this shoulder.

<b>ttttSID 6.7 (CONT'D)
</b>ttIf you get hungry, I'd recommend
ttthe escargot. They're delicious.

tHe carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen.
tParker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6.7.

<b>tINSIDE THE RESTAURANT KITCHEN
</b>
tParker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables, who
twork undistracted. The Vegetables look plastic.

tParker turns a corner, stopping fast. At the other end of the
taisle stands Sid 6.7, who presses his gun against the head of
ta frightened BUSBOY. Sid 6.7 holds the Busboy's body in front
tof his own as a shield.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(to Sid 6.7)
ttWhere's John?

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttPerforming solo.
ttt(a beat)
ttEnjoying the concert so far?

tAdvancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with
this good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs
twatch the showdown.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttRecital's over, asshole.

tHe fires directly through the chest of the innocent Busboy
thitting Sid 6.7.

tThe Sous Chefs gasp in horror as the Busboy drops through Sid
t6.7's grasp to the floor. Dead.

tSid 6.7 stares at Parker in disbelief. Blood is now visible
tflowing from a bullet hole in Sid 6.7's shoulder, which was
tcaused by the same bullet. Sid 6.7's arm dangles uselessly.
tHis gun lies on the floor.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>tt(surprised, but pleased).
ttYou and me aren't so different,
ttafter all...

tParker again pulls the trigger. Click. Click, click. No
tbullets.

<b>ttttSID 6.7 (CONT'D)
</b>ttLike a violin without strings...

tHe takes off around the corner. Grabbing another clip from
tinside his uniform, Parker goes after him. Only to stumble
tover something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through
tits zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a
tbowling ball.

tBeside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing.
tHis hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is
tbeing electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in
ttime.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b><b>ttSHIT!
</b>
tHe scans the room for Sid 6.7. Parker has no idea Sid 6.7 is
tstanding directly behind him. Sid 6.7 grabs Parker by the
tthroat.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttI told you I was going to perform a
ttnew piece with you. It's called,
tt"First You Suffer, Then You Die."
ttHope you like it.

tParker gags, unable to breathe. He then starts to DEx97
tMATERIALIZE from within Sid 6.7's grasp.

<b>ttttSID 6.7 (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(as if to God)
ttNOOOH! You can't take him, yet. I'm
ttnot finished!

tJohn's body also dex97materializes as Parker disappears
tentirely.

tThe blood seeping from Sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and
tstarts retracting into his body. Along with his bone
tfragments. His shoulder is healing itself. Right before your
tvery eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is

<b>tON A MONITOR
</b>
tThe scene continues seamlessly. Sid 6.7's skin heals over his
tshoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their
tproper places. No scar whatsoever.

tHis clothing also returns to perfect condition. Literally, as
tgood as new. This is known as AUTOMATIC RESETTING.

tThe previously dead Busboy also Auto Resets. His wound
thealing by itself. We PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal the monitor
tis one of several

<b>tINSIDE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT CENTER
</b>
ta/k/a LETAC. The facility is a converted aerospace research
tbuilding in Pacoima. Funded by government black book dollars.

tThe look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech
tsparkle. Banks upon banks of computer equipment. Wires,
tcables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look.

tIn complete disarray to the uninitiated. But to those in the
tknow, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the
tworld.

tThe building is partitioned into dozens of stations. At each
tstation, a leading engineer in his field is frantically
treadying a prototype for demonstration. Each new technology
tdesigned to help fight the new Cold War... the War on Crime.

tThe atmosphere is competitive. Voices are loud. Tension,
tanticipation in the air. Only a lucky few will have their
tinventions approved for production.

tLETAC is, quite simply, Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from
<b>t1994.
</b>
tAt a station in the middle of the room, TWO UNCONSCIOUS
tBODIES lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps
tmade of polyurethane.

tEach skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it
tat points designated as neural primes. Each needle is
tdirectly connected to the participant's nervous system.

tThe tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic
twire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers
tsurrounding the beds.

tEach of these components isn't much to look at on its own.
tBut together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of
tsomething very new x97x97 a revolutionary law enforcement
ttraining device whose name you read:

<b>tVIRTUAL REALITY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SIMULATOR
</b>
tTo be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed
tinvolving Parker, John, and Sid 6.7 took place within virtual
treality, not the real world.

tDozens of small character modules, similar to today's
tNintendo game cartridges, are plugged into .the system's main
tconsole.

tEach of the modules bares a name and number, such as MAITRE
tD' 1.7 and SHEILA 3.2. There is no character version number
tgreater than 4.0. Until you see the module labelled SID 6.7.

tThe simulation timer stops at: 17 hours, 52 minutes, 11
tseconds. A clock reads: 3:04:32 PM.

tFour observers, two men and two women, watch virtual reality
tmonitors positioned around the station. One of the men wears
tan L. A. P. D. uniform. His name is WILLIAM COX, 40S. His
tnameplate reads CHIEF OF POLICE.

tOne of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor.
tIntently following the action on screen. Studying it
tclinically. Her name is DR. MADISON CARTER, late 30s.

tShe is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take a
tback seat to her intelligence. She is one of the country's
tforemost authorities on criminal psychology. Her concerns are
tempirical. Her quest is knowledge. She has little in common
twith the other observers.

tThe other man is FREDERICK WALLACE, 5Os, Chairman/CEO of
tLETAC. Expensive suit. Commanding, powerful. But not as
tcommanding, or powerful, as ELIZABETH DEANE, 605, the
tPresidentiallyx97appointed Crime Czars

tElizabeth Deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated
tto LETAC. As well as which prototypes will move on to
tproduction.

<b>ttttDEANE
</b>ttt(quietly to Wallace)
ttWhat did Cox pull him out early
ttfor?

<b>ttttWALLACE
</b>ttBarnes used to work for him when he
ttwas still a cop in the field,
ttremember?

<b>ttttDEANE
</b>ttt(a beat)
ttDon't remind me.

tLAB ASSISTANTS remove the polyurethane skull caps from the
ttwo unconscious bodies. The acupuncture needles remain in the
tcaps. You can now see the faces of the participants:

tParker and John.

tParker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually
treturns to consciousness. He looks very different than his
tvirtual rendering:

tHis hair is long and ragged. His face is unshaven. A scar
tacross his cheek. A hoop earring in one ear. His outfit a
tfilthy prison uniform.

tJohn's outfit matches Parker's. Physically, he looks as
tcleanx97cut as his virtual rendering. Except that he is
tconvulsing. Violently.

tHis flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around
thim. Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. It's ugly.
tFrightening.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(barely conscious)
<b>ttSOMEBODY.. .DO SOMETHING!
</b>
tTWO PARAMEDICS burst through the doors and rush to John. The
tparamedics inject him. Fibrillate him. Repeatedly.

tThe simulator's designer, DARYL LINDENMEYER, 40s, highx97
tstrung, intense, and brilliant beyond words, stands by the
tequipment protectively. He is far more concerned for the
tsafety of his machines than he is for John's life.

tJohn's body goes limp. His vital signs flat. The Paramedics
trecord the time of death and cover the body with a sheet.
tThey begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out.

<b>ttttDEANE
</b>ttt(annoyed to Wallace)
ttWhat the hell happened?

<b>ttttWALLACE
</b>ttt(pointing to needles)
ttLindenmeyer developed neural
ttconnectors that tap directly into
ttthe nervous system. If the
ttsimulator isn't calibrated
ttproperly, experiencing death in
ttthis level of VR is like
ttexperiencing death within a dream.
ttThe experience becomes real.

<b>ttttDEANE
</b>ttt(angrily)
ttSimulations are supposed to give
ttparticipants practice in realistic,
ttdangerous scenarios while
ttprotecting them from the risks they
ttare exposed to in the real world.

<b>ttttWALLACE
</b>ttt(annoyed, to Lindenmeyer)
ttI was assured the problem was
ttcorrected.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttI did fix it.. I told you I did. I
ttdon't know why it happened again.

<b>ttttDEANE
</b>ttAgain?!

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttt(a beat)
ttMy first two pairs of convicts
ttsuffered the same fate.

<b>ttttDEANE
</b>ttt(coldly, to Wallace)
ttWhy wasn't I told?

<b>ttttWALLACE
</b>ttBlack book dollars, black book
ttoperation. You pay me for results,
ttnot how for how I get you there.

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttt(to Deane)
ttI'll tell you one thing -x97 there is
ttno way in hell we should allow any
ttreal officers to train in this damn
ttthing.

<b>ttttDEANE
</b>ttThen about all I've spent $37
ttmillion developing is a very
ttexpensive way to control the prison
ttpopulation.

tAfter giving Wallace a cold, hard stare -- namely at his hand
tstitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond-studded
tcufflinks, she exits. Wallace follows after her quickly. You
tnow notice that the chair Dr. Madison Carter had occupied is
tnow empty. She left a while ago.

tCox remains. Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as
tif it were his child. There are several scratches, but no
tmajor damage. He looks relieved.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(struggling to sit up)
ttHe...only had a year left on his
ttsentence.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttt(annoyed)
ttHow much do you think I care?

tParker, still not fully conscious, hurls himself at
tLindenmeyer.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER (CONT' D)
</b>ttt(hysterical)
ttDon't touch me!...DON'T TOUCH ME!!!

tHe flails his arms wildly. Nearly spasming. This is clearly a
tman who should never drink coffee. TWO armed GUARDS, who've
tbeen standing in the background, pull Parker off Lindenmeyer
tand throw him to the ground.

tLindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put
tParker in handcuffs and leg chains.

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttI'll walk him out.

tThe Guards back off as Cox helps Parker to his feet.

<b>ttttCOX (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(to Parker)
ttYou all right?

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(still clearing his head)
ttWhy'd.. .you pull me out?

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttDonley started experiencing the
ttattack for real. If I hadn't gotten
ttyou out, the same thing would have
tthappened to you.
ttt(a beat)
ttYou may not believe this, Parker,

tbut I still consider us friends.

tHe helps Parker toward the exit as he continues having
tdifficulty with his balance.

<b>tOUTSIDE LETAC
</b>
tThe building is heavily-guarded. Razor wire, land mines,
tarmed sentries. Nobody who shouldn't be here gets anywhere
tnear here.

tCox leads Parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport.
tThe two guards walk behind at a distance. Two more by the
ttransport. The chain between Parker's legs keeps his steps
tshort.

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttWhat the hell did you have to shoot
ttthe busboy for?

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttHe was a computer program for
ttcrissake.

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttYou were supposed to act as if
tteverything was real.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttReal, my ass. It's an overblown
ttgame.
ttt(a beat)
ttAnybody ever catch that fucking
ttpsycho?

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttBefore you, nobody else had gotten
ttclose enough to Sid 6.7 to take a
ttshot at him. Hell, nobody else had
tteven been able to start tracking
tthim before he got to them first.
ttt(eyeing Parker's scar)
ttNew scar x97x97 you making it okay in
ttthere?

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(head down)
ttI'm getting by.

tHe starts walking ahead of Cox. Distancing himself.

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttt(pausing for emphasis) )
ttYou've got to know I tried keeping
ttyou out of general population.
ttGoddam politicians...

tHis voice trails off as Parker turns around, and heads
tdirectly toward him.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(locking eyes)
ttYou want to know how I'm doing?
ttEvery day, I lose a little bit more
ttof myself.
ttt(a beat)
ttI'm becoming something else, and it
ttscares the hell out of me.

tHe turns back toward the transport. Cox follows. Two armed
tGUARDS open the back doors for Parker, then stand poised with
tweapons out and ready.

<b>tINSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR
</b>
tCold metal benches. No windows. Parker climbs in, the only
tpassenger. He looks out the open doors to Cox.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(half-heartedly)
ttBut with the six months off I get
ttfor being your guinea pig, I've
ttonly got to survive another 17
ttyears, 5 months, and 23 days.

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttDon't give up, Parker. Not ever.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(a beat)
ttYou know those cheesy Christmas
ttcards of your family under that
tttree in your back yard you keep
ttsending me every year?

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttWhat about them?

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(a beat)
ttDo me a favor x97x97 keep sending them.

<b>tOUTSIDE LETAC
</b>
tStanding outside the transport, Cox puts his hand on Parker's
tshoulder.

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttTake care, pal.

tBehind him, John's body is loaded into an ambulance. The
tGuards SLAM the prison transport doors shut.

<b>tINSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR
</b>
tParker sits in DARKNESS as the transport begins its trek. The
tonly light comes from a four inch portal, covered in steel
tmesh, through which the Guards can keep an eye on him.

<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttt(tauntingly)
ttHey Parker x97x97 I'm real sorry John
ttboy got fried. What do you think
ttBig Red's gonna do when he finds
ttout you came back without his girl
ttfriend?

tParker sits in silence.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINSIDE LETAC
</b>
tSid 6.7 remains visible on the various monitors around the
troom as Lindenmeyer spot checks the simulator.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(from the monitors)
ttDon't be angry with me, Daryl.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttt(a beat)
ttDid you recognize the son-of-a

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttShould I have?

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttThink hard -- it'll come to you...

tWallace enters briskly.

<b>ttttWALLACE
</b>ttYou embarrassed me in front of the

ttt(a beat)
ttDo you have any idea how much money

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttThe reason you insisted on testing

</b>ttt(hysterical)

</b>
<b>ttttWALLACE
</b>ttt(relishing his authority)
ttYou are to turn over the Sid 6.7

ttfor immediate destruction. Is that
ttunderstood?

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttt(restraining himself)
ttI understand... I understand
ttperfectly.

tWallace ignores him as he walks toward the door. On the
tmonitors, Sid 6.7 starts walking toward you. Into a CLOSEUP.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(from the monitor)
ttHey, Wallace, you really think you
ttcan shut me down?

tWallace stops, staring at a monitor in disbelief.

<b>ttttWALLACE
</b>ttt(to Lindenmeyer)
ttHow does he know who I am?

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttt(pointing to microphone)
ttHe hears...everything.

<b>ttttWALLACE
</b>ttt(approaching the monitor)
ttAs a matter of fact, I do.

tHe exits.

<b>tON THE MONITORS
</b>
taround the room, Sid 6.7 walks to a pay phone and dials a
tnumber.

<b>tINSIDE AN INDUSTRIAL CORRIDOR
</b>
tWallace walks toward the building's entrance. His footsteps
tECHO. His cellular phone RINGS.

<b>ttttWALLACE
</b>ttThis is Wallace...

<b>ttttSID 6.7 (V. 0.)
</b>ttt(through phone)
ttAs a matter of fact, little man,
ttyou're wrong. I think, therefore, I
ttam.

tClick. Sid 6.7 hangs-up. Wallace stops, staring at his phone
tin disbelief.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINSIDE FOLSOM COUNTY MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON
</b>
tParker is led into the Inmate Receiving Room at gunpoint. He
tis ordered to remove his clothing.

tHe stands completely naked, arms held out to the sides, as he
tis strip searched. Every portion of the body in which someone
tcould hide something is closely inspected.

tWithout being graphic, we watch the dex97humanizing procedure.
tHe opens his mouth as wide as possible. Pulls his earlobes
tforeword to reveal behind them. Then bends over, hands on the
tfloor in front of him.

tHe is scanned with a metal detector. So is his clothing,
twhich is then returned to him.

<b>ttttGUARD #1
</b>ttWelcome home, cop.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINSIDE THE PRISON CAFETERIA
</b>
tParker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates. The food
tis unrecognizable. The air thick with humidity and cigarette
tsmoke. Nobody is talking. Just staring. At Parker.

tParker forces down the remainder of his meal, then returns
this utensils to a bin. And heads to the bathroom. All eyes
tfollowing Parker's every move.

tThe other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of
tincredible size following Parker. 6' 6", 255 lbs. His face
tcovered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago.
tThis is BIG RED. He follows Parker into the bathroom.

<b>tINSIDE THE BATHROOM
</b>
tGraffiti covers the walls. Red uses a stained urinal, then
tturns to the stalls. A pair of prisonx97issue shoes and socks
tare visible beneath one of them.

<b>ttttRED
</b>ttTime to hurt...

tRed kicks in the door to the stall. Revealing a pair of shoes
tand socks stuffed with a prison shirt. Red hears something
tbehind him. And turns around slowly.

tParker stands barefooted and shirtless. SCARS are visible
taround each arm just below the elbow. You will learn what
tthese represent momentarily.

tParker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than Red.
tBut the punch Parker delivers to Red's face makes you think
tit's the other way around.

tYou HEAR the sound of metal crushing bone. Red is thrown
tbackwards into the stall. Blood splatters from his mouth,
tadding another shade of redness to his face.

tRed's teeth stick out of Parker's fist. Parker pulls out the
tteeth. He does not bleed. Nor seem in pain. Metal is visible
tbeneath the surface of his skin.

tFor the first time, you notice SMALL TATTOOS on the outsides
tof his palms. They read: WENTLOW MODEL 17-L, and 17-R,
tfollowed by serial numbers.

tRed charges Parker wildly. Parker dodges him like a matador
tdoes a bull. Then brings his fists down savagely on the back
tof Red's head. His skull CRACKS. Red drops to the floor.

tParker jumps on top of him, arms around his neck. Choking
thim. Red staggers to his feet. His eyes wide. His face now

trooms.

tHidden from Reilly's view, Lindenmeyer, the software expert
twho created Sid 6.7, stares jealously through a narrow gap in

tReilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he
tcould touch the contours of Sheila 3.2's body.

<b>ttttREILLY
</b>ttOh, believe me, it is. It is...

tHe is so aroused, he's shaking. Lindenmeyer, on the other
thand, appears almost uninterested. He's used to the routine.

tOn the monitor, Sheila 3.2 continues her stripx97tease.

tSlowly. Sensually. Licking her lips. Grinding her hips.

tPutting on quite a show.

tShe removes her top, revealing ideal breasts. She fondles her
tnipples. As well as the rest of herself.

tLindenmeyer and Reilly continue watching. Reilly can barely
tcontrol himself.

tSheila 3.2 is very, very, very good at what she does. A
tvirtuoso stripper. Reilly is transfixed. Until Lindenmeyer
tpushes a button, BLACKING OUT the virtual reality screens.

<b>ttttREILLY

ttBastard...
ttt(to a monitor)
ttSheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be

tHe rushes out. Sid 6.7 appears on the various monitors next
tto Sheila 3.2. He kisses her cheek. Caresses her body. Sheila
t3.2 enjoys the attention.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttShe's some of your finest work,
ttDaryl.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttAll my work is my finest.

tSid 6.7 continues appreciating Sheila 3.2. As Reilly races
tback in, the monitors then all go BLACK.

tReilly, completely out of breath, holds a python by it's
thead. He dangles the snake right in front of Lindenmeyer's
tface. Terrifying him.

</b>ttt(backing away fast)
ttGet that fucking thing away from

<b>ttttREILLY
</b>ttt(laughing)
ttYou're...such a wimp.

tHe grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the
tsnake. The half of the snake which drops to the floor stops
tmoving.

tBut the half still in Reilly's hand begins REGENERATING a new
ttail. Literally growing a new one. Lindenmeyer can't believe
this eyes. He studies the snake closely.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttt(restraining himself)
ttHow do you kill it?

<b>ttttREILLY
</b>ttSeparate the character module from
ttthe neural net...

tUsing Lindenmeyer's scissors, he cuts off the snake's head
tand removes a small character module connected to the base of
tthe neural net. The snake stops moving. It "dies."

<b>ttttREILLY (CONT'D)
</b>tt... and you get nanox97death.

ttDon't worry, I've got a bunch of

tHe exits. As Lindenmeyer reaches for the Sheila 3.2 character
tmodule, Sid 6.7 appears on the screen in front of him and
twinks.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttYou catching my drift?

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttI think I understand what you have

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttYou need a maid.

<b>ttttREILLY
</b>ttWhat I need is a nymphomaniac.

tHe removes a tarp from a large, rectangular, metallic tank
twith a circular window in the middle of it.

tClear, plastic tubing, which branches into hundreds of
tincreasingly smaller and smaller branches, floats in
telectrified fluid. The tubing is a synthetic human nervous
tsystem.

<b>tINSIDE REILLY'S OFFICE
</b>
tReilly turns to Lindenmeyer.

<b>ttttREILLY
</b>ttWhere's the Sheila 3.2 module?

tLindenmeyer hands him the labelx97less character module. Reilly
topens the "incubator."

<b>tINSIDE THE INCUBATOR
</b>
tReilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the
tsynthetic nervous system.

tThe polymer neural net instantly crackles with life. It grows
taround the module. Cells (nanox97mechanisms) immediately begin
tadhering to the tubing. Forming the beginnings of a skeletal
tarchitecture.

tIt's night. Light is dim. His bed is empty. The wall next to
tit is completely bare, except for the five Christmas cards
tsent each year by Chief Cox.

tThe other two walls in the cell, however, look very
tdifferent. They are completely covered with primitive
tpaintings x97x97 darkly colored, surreal images. Imagine the
tLascaux cave paintings as worksx97inx97progress. Painted by Dali.
tExcept these images were created by Parker Barnes.

tHe kneels in a corner, working intensely on another image.
tCompletely lost in concentration. His hands, his clothing,
tcovered in paint. He almost appears to be part of the art
twork.

tThe work is intricate. It clearly takes Parker a very long
ttime. Which gives him something to do during the nights he is
tunable to sleep. Which is most of them.

tHe is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the
tconstant taunts ECHOING throughout the cell block. Threats of
tthe ugliest, most vile kind. The kind Parker has had to live
twith every night for the last five years.

tPausing to admire his work, Parker finally hears the taunts.

tHis face becoming a mixture of frustration, guilt, and anger.

tParker immediately resumes painting.

tThe human form inside incubator opens the hatch. Steam pours
tout from within its confines as it climbs out slowly.

tThe figure stands within the mist, admiring itself. Then its

tLindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen. The office door is
tunlocked, and open. Watching Sid 6.7's expression, you
trealize something isn't quite right.

tHis expression is exaggerated. Artificial. Only for a moment,
tbut it's enough to remind you Sid 6.7 is not human.

tThe billions of nanox97mechanisms which make up his anatomy are
tstill learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion.
tSid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin.

tIn various ways throughout his "life" x97x97 be it a wandering
teye, or a momentary limp x97- you will be reminded that Sid 6.7
tis a synthetic nanox97organism unlike anyone has ever seen.

tA surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 6.7's attention.
tPicking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razorx97
tsharp knife blade. Cutting himself slightly. A drop of blood
tappears. Sid 6.7 tastes his (synthetic) blood.

tParker lies on an operating table, receiving anesthesia, as a
tSURGEON drills a small hole into his skull. The surgeon
tinserts a minute, fiber-optic camera into the hole.

tParker's brain is displayed on a monitor. The surgeon uses
tthe image to guide him as he carefully inserts the locater

tParker's rapid eye movements tell you the anesthetist is
tcorrect. Parker is dreaming.

<b>tINSIDE A VIEWING ROOM
</b>
tCox and Deane watch the operation through a large window.

tMadison enters, carrying a folder labelled:tINMATE #673429
tA/K/A PARKER BARNES. She withdraws several PHOTOGRAPHS from
tthe folder, placing the first one in front of Deane.

</b>ttThis is Parker Barnes six years

tThe photograph is in black and white. But as we MOVE IN
tCLOSER, it takes on color. As well as comes to life. Then

tfrom Parker's cell. Then mutating into something else.

tHe walks around the car, brushing past her. Then drops to his

tParker and Madison make their way through the curious trying
tto see what's going on. Several REPORTERS double-take Parker,
tthen quickly instruct their PHOTOGRAPHERS to take shots of

tParker and Madison present their identification to the COPS
tkeeping the curious at bay.

<b>ttttCOP #1
</b>ttt(recognizing Parker)
ttSon...of...a...bitch.

tParker and Madison continue toward the house. Getting an

tCOPS. Some look on with awe. Some with disdain. But nobody is
tin between.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttt(quietly to Parker)
ttYou ready for this?

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttDon't worry. If I can't handle it,
ttI'll just kill everybody.

tHe gives her a brief smile. Which Madison does not return.
tOne of the other policemen tentatively approaches Parker.

<b>ttttCOP #2
</b>ttI've always wanted to tell you that

</b>ttt(to Cop #2)
ttThen you'd be a disgrace to the

tHe turns to Parker, who is looking right at him. Not with

tthe shit out of Cop #3, who walks away.

<b>tINSIDE THE SUBURBAN HOME
</b>
tInvestigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every

tnothing but their eyes.

tLying in the middle of the living room are the four victims:

tthe affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive. Their
tbodies were left in similar condition to Reilly's. Except

<b>tINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S DUPLEX
</b>
tMadison races through the broken front door to find Parker
tchecking his weapon. Before she can speak, he motions for
tMadison to freeze and be silent.

tParker hears Something. Something moving inside the duplex.
tHis every movement is now that of a predator.

tMadison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse. She
tdoes not handle it with confidence. Parker shakes his head.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttDo me one favor x97x97 if you shoot at
ttanything, make sure I'm nowhere
ttnear it.

tParker bolts through the duplex, storming into rooms
tfuriously. His movements are aggressive. Madison searches
tother rooms methodically. She is not timid. Just
tinexperienced in the field.

tShe passes a video camera mounted on a tripod. Pointed out
tthe window at a neighbor's bathroom. Dozens of cassettes
tsurround the tripod. The labels are dated x97x97 covering every
tday of the last month.

tParker and Madison enter opposite sides of the kitchen with
ttheir guns drawn, nearly shooting each other. Madison puts
tdown her gun. Parker does not. The noise persists.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(looking through his

ttBang...

tHe smiles wickedly, and continues on. Madison takes a deep
tbreath, then resumes her search. Parker and Madison end up

<b>tINSIDE LINDENMEYER'S HOME OFFICE
</b>
tIt's as if the Information Superhighway ended in here.
tCluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers,

tautobiographies of human villainy.

tCLASSICAL MUSIC and lifex97like SOUND EFFECTS can be heard

<b>tON THE COMPUTER MONITOR
</b>
tAn animated man, who resembles Lindenmeyer, walks peacefully
tthrough a park. He then starts killing everything in sight.
tMen, women, squirrels, even flowers. All to classical music.

tThe scene immediately starts over, with the man once again
twalking peacefully through the park. This was Lindenmeyer's
<b>tSCREEN SAVER.
</b>

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(looking at a book shelf)
ttMaybe after they catch him, you

tHe runs his finger along a book shelf, pausing at two books
tin particular. Their titles are: UNDERSTANDING THE CRIMINAL
tMIND, and CRIMINAL PURSUIT -- A PSYCHOLOGICAL GUIDE FOR LAW
tENFORCEMENT. They were written by Dr. Madison Carter.

<b>ttttPARKER (CONT'D)
</b>ttI'm surprised you didn't write one

tname: MAESTRO.

<b>ttttMADISON (CONT'D)
</b>ttRemember a few years ago when music

ttthere was no better person to

tMadison elects not to respond. She sits down at the computer,
twhich rests between busts of Beethoven and Mozart, and begins
ttyping at the computer. She works with efficiency. Knowing
texactly what she's doing. She is now in her element.

tFrom a shelf, Parker picks up a moldy piece of licorice
tinserted into a half-eaten pudding cup. Then flips through
tone of the books written by Madison. Only half-interested.

tThe graphics show you that Sid 1.2 was a combination of
tCharles Manson and Billy the Kid. You see what look like two

tBerkowitz was added to create Sid 1.3. A three-way
tpsychological battle, more hostile than the first, occurs.
tSid 1.4, adding the terrorist, Abu Nidal, makes the conflict
teven more violent. And so on.

tMoments later, Karin comes back out and sits on the front

tWondering who this strange man is, and why he's sitting in a

tShe rifles through data concerning MATHEW GRIMES, who was the
tleader of a cult of cyber anarchists. He was known as the
tCharles Manson of technological terrorism.

<b>tON HER COMPUTER SCREEN
</b>
tFrom both newspaper ARTICLES and news FOOTAGE, the following
tinformation about him becomes clear:

tGrimes was an expert at media manipulation. He delighted in
tpublicly humiliating anyone who stood in his way. The Mayor
tof Los Angeles, Bob Bennett, who offered increasingly higher
trewards for Grimes' capture, was Grimes' primary nemesis.

tL.A.P.D. Special Investigations Division Officer Parker
tBarnes managed to stop Grimes from killing Mayor Bennett.
tGrimes retaliated by repeatedly humiliating Parker with false
tleads and lawsuits.

tYou see footage of a woman lying dead in an alley. A note is
tpinned to her clothing. The note reads: "HEY, PARKER, THIS
<b>tONE'S FOR YOU."
</b>
tGrimes then kidnapped Parker's wife and daughter. Parker
tlocated the group in a club, but only in time to witness
ttheir deaths. Parker then killed everybody in the club,
tincluding the six cult members and two completely innocent
tpeople.

tHe smiles. Then she smiles. She wiggles her nose. Then so
tdoes he.

tMadison comes out wearing fresh clothing, then kisses her
tdaughter good night. As Madison goes to the squad car, Karin
twaves good-bye to Parker. He does the same. Karin's
tbabysitter then leads her back inside the house.

tSid 6.7 points his gun at one group, then another, waving his
tarm as if he were a conductor, and as if his gun were a

tSid 6.7 turns to the other CUSTOMERS in the store. Most of
tthem are watching other channels. He goes over to a control
tpad on a counter and presses several buttons.

tNow EVERY TV in the store has the news with the reporter
toutside the bar on. A SKINHEAD, sporting numerous Nazi
tswastika tattoos, manually changes the channel on one of the
tTVs to a Dodger baseball game.

tSid 6.7 walks over to the Skinhead and changes the channel
tback to the news.

<b>ttttSKINHEAD
</b>ttYou don't wanna fuck with me, man.

tHe moves to the next TV over and changes the channel to the
tbaseball game. Sid 6.7 moves over with him, standing directly
tbehind the Skinhead as if also interested in the Dodgers.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(singing softly)
ttTake me out to the ball game...

tHe places his hands on the Skinhead's head and efficiently
tsnaps his head around, breaking his neck.

</b>ttBuy me some peanuts and Cracker
ttJack... I don't care if I ever come

tHe drops the Skinhead to the floor, never once taking his
teyes off the TV.

<b>tON THE TV
</b>
tA Dodger game is in progress. A pop fly is caught by the
tcenter fielder. The runner at third tags and heads for home.
tThe play at the plate is close. The umpire calls the runner
tout.

tThe camera pans to the MASSIVE SCREEN over left field to show
tthe instant replay. Reactions of fans around the stadium are
tshown in CLOSEx97UP. The fans also respond to seeing themselves
ton the massive screen.

<b>tINSIDE THE ELECTRONICS STORE
</b>
tSid 6.7 watches the TV intently, completely ignoring the
thorrified customers circling around him because of the dead
tSkinhead at his feet. A SALESMAN, who'd been demonstrating a
tvideocamera, tapes Sid 6.7 from behind a customer.

<b>tSALESMAN'S POV -- HANDHELD VIDEO
</b>
tAs Sid 6.7 realizes he's being videotaped, his entire face
tseems to light up. Playing directly to the camera, he clearly
tloves being in the spotlight. The attention. The focus. It's
tsuddenly as if he's had years of training. He is completely
tat ease. And simply captivating.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(direct address)
ttI'm sorry I can't do more for you.
ttt(pointing to the Skinhead)
ttPublic service really isn't my

treaches out of frame to help the increasinglyx97shaky salesman
tsteady the camera.

tThe stadium's closed-circuit TV director is not in his chair.

tHe's lying dead on the floor.

tThe closedx97circuit camera remains focused on the Woman. The

tA bullet rips through Sid 6.7's side. Blood begins to seep
tfrom the wound. But then immediately begins to retract. Once

tThe car in the lead is Parker's.

</b>
tParker comes within inches of mowing down several people, who
tkeep right on running. Parker jumps out of the vehicle,
tscanning faces. In predator mode. Madison gets out, clearly
tshaken. Parker locks his gaze on somebody in the distance.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tA guy in Dodger baseball cap and jacket. Walking calmly away
tfrom the stadium. He descends down an escalator into a
trecently-built subway station. It is Sid 6.7.

<b>tPARKER
</b>
tcharges after him. A heatx97seeking missile locked on target.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttParker.. .Parker!

tShe does the best she can to follow after him. People knock
tinto Parker as hard as he does them. A human version of
tbumper cars.

tReaching the entrance to the subway, Parker leaps down the
tescalator three steps at a time. Madison remains in his wake.

<b>tINSIDE THE SUBWAY STATION
</b>
tParker and Madison hop the turnstiles. Only to be stopped by
ta remotex97controlled, boxx97shaped robotic sentry, which is
tidentical to one you have seen before. This sentry was one of
tReilly's creations at LETAC.

</b>ttReal effective security...

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttYou could have just flashed him

tThey come to a fork: one tunnel goes to east/west trains, the
tother to north/south.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttWhich way?

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttBoth.

tHe races down the tunnel to the north/south trains. Madison
theads down the other. Her determination beginning to win out
tover her inexperience.

<b>tPARKER
</b>
thesitates at the escalator leading to the south-bound side of
tthe tracks.
tFurther down the tunnel is the escalator to the northx97bound
ttrains. Parker chooses the escalator closest to him.

<b>tON THE SOUTH-BOUND PLATFORM
</b>
tPassengers pass the time by watching a television mounted
tabove them. Except for Parker, who scans the crowd. Then
tacross the tracks.

<b>tON THE NORTH-BOUND PLATFORM
</b>
tIn the entire crowd, there is only one person not watching
tthe TV screen. He is watching Parker. Through his gun sight.
tSid 6.7 pulls the trigger. BOOM!

<b>tON THE SOUTH-BOUND PLATFORM
</b>
tParker dives to the ground, just avoiding the bullet. He
tscrambles behind a pillar for protection. Only to see the guy
tstanding behind him wasn't as lucky.

<b>tON THE EAST-BOUND PLATFORM
</b>
tMadison hears the gunshot ECHO through the station. Which
tscares the already-terrified fans trying to get away from
tDodger Stadium. Chaos is rapidly becoming Pandemonium.

tShe races up the escalator, taking out her weapon.

<b>tttttCUT TO:

</b>
tpeeking out from behind the pillar on the south-bound
tplatform.

<b>tPARKER'S POV -- ACROSS THE TRACKS
</b>
tPassengers rush in every direction. Some are screaming. Some
tare crying. Nobody knows who fired the shot. Or where to go.
tBut everyone is going somewhere.

tIncluding Sid 6.7, who makes his way through the flurry of
tmovement toward the up escalator. It is difficult to keep
tsight of him.

</b>
tmoves toward the edge of the platform, aiming his gun across
tthe tracks. Those around him quickly back away.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(yelling)

</b>ttt(screaming)
<b>ttGET DOWN!!!

tThe rest of the passengers hit the deck, except for a COLLEGE
tSTUDENT listening to music on headphones. He is riding the
tescalator up. Sid 6.7 stands behind him, using the student as
ta shield.

<b>tPARKER' S POV
</b>
tAs Sid 6.7 ascends, slight portions of his body are
tmomentarily exposed behind the student as he sways with the
tmusic coming from his headphones. Parker does NOT have a
tclean shot.

tIn 10 seconds, Sid 6.7 will disappear from view completely
tand Parker will have no shot at all. A momentary sliver of
tSid 6.7 becomes visible. An inch-and-a-half at most.

<b>tPARKER
</b>
tdoesn't hesitate. He lines up his shot and pulls the trigger.

<b>tON THE NORTH-BOUND UP ESCALATOR
</b>
tThe college student standing in front of Sid 6.7 gets winged
tin the shoulder. Not a serious wound, but a painful one just
tthe same.

tThe bullet must have hit bone, because it deflected upon
timpact, missing Sid 6.7 entirely.

tThe student drops to the escalator, screaming in pain. Sid
t6.7 crouches beside him.

<b>tPARKER'S POV
</b>
tThe top of Sid 6.7's head is exposed an inch, maybe two.

<b>tPARKER
</b>
tfires again. Repeatedly. Moving closer and closer to the edge
tof the platform, trying to get a better angle while he still
thas a shot.

tParker moves to the very edge of the platform. His arm
textended out over it. Completely oblivious to

<b>tTHE SUBWAY TRAIN
</b>
trocketing into the station toward the south-bound platform.

<b>tMADISON
</b>
tleaps off the descending escalator on the southx97bound side
tand rushes to Parker.

tShe pulls Parker back just before the train reaches him. Had
this arm still been raised, Parker would have lost his arm a
tsecond time.

tThey tumble to the floor. A PASSENGER rushes to Madison.

<b>ttttPASSENGER #1
</b>ttt(pointing to Parker)

<b>ttttPASSENGER #2
</b>ttHe just shot an innocent bystander!

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(not looking back)
ttIf you're gonna do it, better do it

tHe keeps right on going up the escalator.

<b>tMADISON
</b>
tlines up her shot. Hands shaking. With both fear and
tdetermination. Her finger presses down on the trigger...but
tshe can't do it.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttDammit!

tShe chases after him.

<b>tINSIDE THE NORTH/SOUTH TUNNEL
</b>
tMadison looks in both directions as she gets off the
tescalator. Parker is nowhere to be seen.

tMoving toward her slowly is the wounded college student, who
tclutches his bleeding shoulder. He is shivering. Going into
tshock. Madison goes to him, taking off his headphones.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttLet me help you...

tHe collapses in her arms.

<b>ttttCOLLEGE STUDENT
</b>ttt(delirious)
ttWhat did I do?...I didn't do

tClearly versed in emergency medical treatment, Madison
tattends to his wound. Parker returns.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tOUTSIDE OF THE SUBWAY STATION
</b>
t30 minutes later. The chaos outside Dodger Stadium has
tsubsided. Madison and two PARAMEDICS lead the bandaged
tCollege Student to an ambulance.

tMadison goes to Parker, who sits quietly by himself. Elbows
ton his knees. Head between his hands. Staring at the cement
tbetween his feet.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttt(angrily)
ttDo you have any idea the trauma you
ttput that kid through?!

tParker doesn't respond. All around them, a cacophony of news
tbroadcasts is heard. From passing cars. From boom boxes. From
tportable TVs. Over and over, you hear what Sid 6.7 had said
twhile killing the woman in Dodger Stadium:

<b>ttttSID 6.7 (V. 0.)
</b>ttt(recorded)
ttHey, Parker, this one's for you...
ttHey, Parker, this one's for you...

tAs Parker raises his head slowly, you realize you are looking
tat the face of a wild animal. Eyes rabid. Jaw clenched. Pure
tanger. Violence about to erupt. Without fear. Without guilt.
tThe beast within has been unleashed.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(in a whisper)
ttThat's Grimes...

tMadison backs away in fear. Parker rises gradually.

<b>ttttPARKER (CONT'D)
</b>tt(voice slowly rising) The man who

</b>ttt(exploding)
ttGrimes is back! He's back! He's
ttcome back!!!

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>tt(standing her ground) No! Grimes

ttt(a beat)
ttGet a hold of yourself!

tShe tries to grab him by the shoulders. Parker blocks her
tarms away.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(going nosex97tox97nose)
ttBut he's in there. And you knew it,
ttdidn't you? Didn't you?!

tShe tries to back away, but backs herself against a light
tpole. Madison has nowhere to go. Parker grabs her by the
tcollar, and shoves her against the pole. Hard.

<b>ttttPARKER (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(hysterical)
ttGod, you fucking know-it-all!
ttYou've known all along and didn't

<b>ttttPARKER (CONT'D)

ttlose it?! Go over the edge?! Huh?!
ttIs that what you were afraid of?!
<b>ttWHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME??!!!
</b>
tA prison transport and another police vehicle pull up to them
tfast. Two of the Prison Guards met earlier jump out of the
ttransport, advancing on Parker. Their weapons aimed at his
thead.

<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttHands up! Now!

tParker slowly raises his hands in the air. A Guard relieves
thim of his weapon.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttt(recovering)
ttWhat's going on?

<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttHe's going back where he belongs.

tDeane and Cox step out of the police vehicle.

<b>ttttDEANE
</b>ttt(to Madison)
ttYou were right, Dr. Carter. Letting

ttt(to Madison)
ttChief Cox will give you a ride back
ttto the station. You will provide

ttt(to Parker)
ttEnjoy the rest of your sentence,
ttMr. Barnes.

tShe exits. Cox and Parker stand facing each other. Cox wishes
tthere was something he could do. Parker looks completely out
tof it. Cox extends his hand. After a moment, Parker takes it.
tBut his mind is way off elsewhere.

<b>ttttGUARD
</b>ttt(forcefully to Parker)
ttLet's go.

tMadison looks on as Parker is herded roughly into the back of
tthe prison transport.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttParker...

tParker shuts her up with a look. There is nothing that can be
tsaid. The prison transport doors are SLAMMED shut. The
tvehicle takes off.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINSIDE COX'S POLICE VEHICLE
</b>
tCox and Madison head back toward L. A. P. D. Headquarters.
tThey are in midx97conversation:

</b>ttt(with regret)
ttI should have told him.

</b>ttDon't blame yourself. In your

ttSo do you think Grimes has become

<b>tttttCUT TO:

<b>tTHE PRISON TRANSPORT
</b>
tcomes to a stop at a traffic light.

<b>tINSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR

tParker sits alone in the darkness. Motionless. Until the
tsound of TWO GUNSHOTS piercing the transport's front
twindshield SHATTERS the silence.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttWhat the hell's going on?!

tHe scrambles to the front of the compartment, pressing his
tface against the steel mesh of the fourx97inch portal.

<b>tHIS POV -- LOOKING THROUGH PORTAL
</b>
tTwo bullet holes are visible in the windshield. The two

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(neighborly)
ttHey, old buddy, old pal, good to

tHe savagely hurls himself against his confines. Bone vs.

ttYou really are pathetic, you know

tslumps in a corner. Out of breath. Bleeding. Sore. All he can
tdo is stare out through the portal's mesh at Sid 6.7.

tMadison enters wearily, late afternoon. Exhausted from the
tevents of the last two days, she starts to undress. Her
tclothing is filthy. So is her skin. She could use a good
tshower, and a better massage.

tMadison examines the various cuts and bruises she's received
talong the way. Not exactly war wounds, but to somebody used
tto sitting behind a desk, they are.

tShe absentmindedly turns on the television, then goes into
ther bathroom. Madison looks at her face in the mirror. She's
tlooked better. After splashing cold water on her face, she
tcomes to the same conclusion.

tMadison takes two aspirin. And then two more. Wishing they
twould take effect immediately. Finally hearing the news on

tsight of Mayor Bennett's upcoming Re-Election Rally, Cox
tsupervises an army of L. A. P. D. officers who are securing
tthe area. Bombx97sniffing dogs. Rooftop snipers. Helicopter

tAnyone doing anything within 100 yards of the building is
tsearched, including the REPORTERS and their CAMERA CREWS
tcovering the convention's security.

tShe points to what she's looking at. Looking through his

taim his binoculars.

tHe scans the bridge. Finally settling on Sid 6.7, who is

tThey move briskly down the block toward the bridge. Quickly

treach the top of the stairs. Sid 6.7 remains on the phone,
this back toward Parker and Madison. They split-up, winding
ttheir way through the crowd waiting for an arriving bus.

tAs the bus pulls to the stop, the awaiting passengers move
ttoward the opening doors. Obscuring Parker's view of the
tpayphone.

tParker shoves his way through the crowd, only to see Sid 6.7
tholding Madison in front of him, his gun to her head. Parker
ttrains his weapon at Sid 6.7. He doesn't have a clean shot.

<b>ttttSID 6.7

ttBrings back memories, doesn't it?

<b>tTHROUGH A SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE
</b>
tParker's chest is put into the cross-hairs as the bus pulls
taway from the stop. He is focused on Parker, and Parker only.

<b>tTHE SNIPER
</b>
tis some 300 yards away on a rooftop. His rifle is mounted on
ta tripod. His aim is perfectly steady.

<b>ttttSNIPER
</b>ttt(into his radio headset)
ttSay goodx97bye, Parker Barnes...

tParker stands frozen, staring at Sid 6.7 through his gun

</b>ttt(to Parker)
ttI wouldn't pull the trigger if I

tCox advances toward Sid 6.7 from the side of the bridge.
tCox's gun out and ready. His finger on the trigger.

<b>ttttCOX
</b>ttHey, Sid, what were you planning on
ttdoing with the C-4?

tSid 6.7 turns his head in surprise toward Cox as a rifle is
tFIRED in the distance. Cox steps directly in the sniper's
tline-of-fire and takes the bullet meant for Parker through
tthe chest. Cox drops to the bridge.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b><b>ttNOOOOOO!
</b>
tHe rushes to Cox. Parker drops to his knees, cradling Cox's
thead. Cox isn't long for this earth. Looking up to Parker, he
ttries to talk. But nothing comes out.

<b>ttttPARKER (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(compassionately)
ttDon't worry, I know. I know.

tCox's eyes roll back in his head. Parker then closes them and
tgently lays his head on the sidewalk.

tParker turns his head toward Sid 6.7, who's released Madison
tand is jumping over a railing to the street 20 feet below.
tParker rushes to the railing.

ttThe garbage truck disappears
ttbeneath the bridge.

<b>tON THE BRIDGE
</b>
tA dozen cops advance toward Parker. Weapons drawn.

<b>ttttCOP #4
</b>ttFreeze!

tParker ignores them. He bolts across the street, moving in
tthe same direction as the bus below. Through speeding
ttraffic.

tBullets fly. Parker keeps charging. Right in front of a
tmoving van barreling across the bridge. The cops lose sight
tof Parker.

<b>ttttCOP #5
</b>ttThink he made it?

<b>tON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
</b>
tParker dives onto the sidewalk, avoiding the speeding van by
tinches. Getting to his feet, he launches himself up and over
tthe railing...

<b>tON THE STREET
</b>
tThe garbage truck passes beneath Parker as he leaps from the
tbridge.

<b>tON TOP OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK
</b>
tParker lands on the back of the truck. Right next the opening
tand-closing steel jaws of the truck's massive trash
tcompactor. His gun tumbles from his hand, falling to the
tstreet.

tSid 6.7 dives on top of Parker, putting him flat on his

tParker. Hard.

tfor Lindenmeyer. Her every instinct telling her he's here. He
tmust be.

tShe spots him. Veering from the direction the cops headed in,
tMadison casually wades into the crowd. She takes out her

tweapon and stops behind Lindenmeyer. Even in disguise, he

tParker and Sid 6.7 continue battling next to the compactor's

</b>ttWhere did you plant the C-4?!

tHe should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking
tquestions, because he's losing. Parker takes a wicked shot to
tthe face, and then the groin. Sid 6.7 holds Parker's head
tbetween the compactor's jaws. Which are closing.

tWith every last ounce of effort he has, Parker hurls his legs
tup into Sid 6.7. Which throws Sid 6.7 into the compactor.

tThe steel jaws immediately close in on Sid 6.7, who
tfrantically tries to climb out. He gets his hands out. Then
this head. But that's about it.

tWithout emphasizing graphic detail, Sid 6.7 is decapitated.
tHis lifeless body drops back into the compactor.

tHis head tumbles to the street. The force of the impact
tcauses the Sid 6.7 character module to separate from the
tneural net.

tThe character module scatters into the street. Parker
timmediately jumps off the truck after it.

<b>tON THE STREET
</b>
tParker's landing isn't pretty. Finally getting to his feet,
the sees the Sid 6.7 character module is about to be run over.

tParker dives for it, nearly getting run over himself.

tThe approaching car SCREECHES to a halt next to him. It's
tdriven by Lindenmeyer. At gunpoint. Madison sits behind him,
ther gun to his head.

tWHAM! The car behind them obviously wasn't prepared to stop
tso quickly. The bumpers of the two cars are now intertwined.
tNeither vehicle will be going anywhere soon.

tMadison pulls Lindenmeyer roughly out of the car. She drags
thim to Parker, who is still on his knees, clutching the Sid
t6.7 character module. SIRENS approach in the distance.

tThe Sid 6.7 character module is plugged into the system's
tmain console. Lindenmeyer sits at the controls. Madison next
tto him, her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head.

tThey are both watching Parker chase Sid 6.7 on the monitor in
tfront of them. Parker continues experiencing intolerable
tpain. A clock reads 4:00 AM. They are the only ones inside
tthe entire facility.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttI told you this would work.. By

</b>ttt(innocently)
ttHow should I know?

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttt(getting an idea)
ttShow me his physical sensory level.

tShe clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttI wonder how that...

<b>ttttMADISON (CONT'D)
</b>ttTurn it down!

tLindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100%.

</b>
tParker immediately returns back to normal. His pace picks up.
tHe starts closing the gap between him and Sid 6.7 as he races
tinto a shopping mall.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL
</b>
tThe place is a sevenx97story mecca of shopping. An atrium
tallows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh.
tSid 6.7 rushes up the escalators. Going up to the second
tfloor. Then the third.

tParker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator.

tThrowing people out of his way.

<b>tON THE SEVENTH FLOOR
</b>
twhich is also the highest, Sid 6.7 veers out of view. Parker
traces up the final steps to the seventh floor. Sid 6.7 is
tnowhere to be seen.

tParker searches methodically. Efficiently. He finally spots
tSid 6.7. Who has Parker's head lined-up perfectly in his gun
tsight. Parker is a sitting duck. BOOM!

tParker dives behind AFFLUENT SHOPPER 2.1, who takes a bullet
tin his ascot. Parker quickly grabs him, and uses his body as
ta shield against Sid 6.7's constant gunfire until Parker
tarrives behind a marble column.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(surprised at Parker's
ttruthlessness)
ttWe really aren't that different,
ttare we?

tWhat he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent
tShopper 2.1 is Auto Resetting. Parker puts his gun to the
tshopper's head.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttDon't move, and don't make a sound.
ttGot it?

tAffluent Shopper 2.1 nods his head repeatedly. Parker
tcollects himself behind the column, then pivots out from
tbehind it. Firing in Sid 6.7's direction. Each bullet finds
tits mark.

tAbsorbing the blows, Sid 6.7 backs up against the atrium
trailing. Taking one final shot, he falls backward. Over the
trailing.

<b>tPARKER'S POV
</b>
tSid 6.7 tumbles through the atrium. Out of control.

tSpeeding toward the ground seven floors below.

<b>tSID 6.7'S POV
</b>
tThe sense of momentum is exhilarating. And terrifying. If you
tget dizzy easily, close your eyes.

<b>tFROM THE FIRST FLOOR
</b>
tSid 6.7 falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you.
tA 200 pound rock. WHAM!!!

tHe lands face down in the marble floor. The impact is bonex97
tcrushing. Sid 6.7 does not move.

tUntil he begins to regenerate. His fluids begin returning to
this body. His bones regaining proper form. Within seconds,
this body appears as good as new.

t(Technically, because this is VR1 the proper term would be
tAuto. Reset. But since Sid 6.7 thinks he's in the real world,
tregenerating is what he thinks he's doing.)

tSid 6.7 stands, dusting himself off.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttMan, what a rush.
ttt(yelling up to Parker)
ttAdios, amigo!

tGrabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby.

<b>tON THE SEVENTH FLOOR
</b>
tParker retrieves his gun, then bolts down the escalators.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINSIDE LETAC
</b>
tMadison and Lindenmeyer watch Parker on screen. Madison still
thas her gun trained on Lindenmeyer, who notices a WARNING
tLIGHT start to flash. He turns to Parker's unconscious body
tlying on the bed. Lindenmeyer looks concerned.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttWhat's wrong?

tLindenmeyer checks several readings on his console.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttHe's developing a hemisphere
ttimbalance.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttTalk so I can understand.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttIf I don't adjust the level of
ttneural information each side of his

ttable to walk when I take him out of
<b>ttVR.
</b>
<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttThen fix it.

tAs Lindenmeyer moves to Parker, Madison stays right with him.
tHer gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head. Lindenmeyer carefully
tremoves one of the neural connectors from Parker's skull cap.
tBefore removing another, he looks for a safe place to put the
tconnector.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER
</b>ttI need you to hold this. It can't
ttget any dirt on it.

tMadison is reluctant, but doesn't know what else to do.
tLindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free
thand.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER (CONT ' D)
</b>ttAll you have to do is hold the
ttneedle at the base. Just make sure
ttnot to jab yourself with the
ttpoint...

tShe clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun
twith her right. Lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector
tfrom Parker's skull.

tHolding this second needle at the base, Lindenmeyer makes
tseveral adjustments on the neural management computer, then
tmoves slowly back to Madison.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER (CONT'D)
</b>ttHand me the connector nice and...

tHe suddenly jabs his neural connector into Madison's right
tforearm. Madison has no time to react. 10,000 volts of
telectricity instantly courses through her body.

tMadison drops to the floor, unconscious. The needle she had
tbeen holding falls from her grasp, breaking the circuit. She
tstops being electrocuted. Which saves her life.

<b>ttttLINDENMEYER (CONT' D)
</b>ttt(as Sid 6.7 had said)
ttGod, some people are stupid.

tHe sits back down at the simulator's main console, and starts
tto type commands. On the monitor, Parker is visible exiting
tthe shopping mall.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tOUTSIDE THE SHOPPING MALL
</b>
tParker races out the door. BOOM! That was left knee cap. He
ttumbles to the street. His gun flying from his hand.

tParker crawls desperately toward his weapon. But not fast
tenough. Sid 6.7 arrives at the weapon first.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttSo close, and yet, so far...

tHe kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his gun at
tParker's head.

<b>ttttSID 6.7 (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt's really too bad you have to
ttmiss the Grand Finale.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttI thought you liked me being in the

tSid 6.7 pauses to think about it.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(considering the idea)
ttYou know, I do want you to see it.

tHe shoots Parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of his
tlegs useless.

tThe view is incredible. You can see from the Pacific to

tSid 6.7 ties Parker to a chair at the roof's very edge. He is

</b>
tTime is moving backwards. Literally.

<b>tON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER
</b>
tSid 6.7 pauses, then goes over to Parker and checks his

tspreads slowly across Sid 6.7's face as he admires the
tbeautiful sky above him.

</b>

</b>ttBut don't worry. You won't be alone

tHe removes the Sid 6.7 character module from its slot and
texits the station.

<b>tON THE ROOF OF THE HOLLYWOOD TOWER
</b>
tOne side of Parker's chair gradually starts to rise. Parker
tlooks down to see the roof surrealistically swelling beneath
this chair. This could only happen in virtual reality.

tIn a matter of minutes, he is going to be thrown over the
troof's edge. The next stop is 693 feet down.

tthere is no one there to hear him.

tThe garbage truck is parked in a loading dock. Lindenmeyer
tclimbs awkwardly onto the truck, then into the compactor.

<b>tINSIDE THE GARBAGE TRUCK COMPACTOR
</b>
tLindenmeyer wades through trash until he comes upon Sid 6.7's
theadless body. The polymer neural net visible within its

tgelatinous base. But nothing happens.

tLindenmeyer looks on with awe as Sid 6.7 grows a new head
tright before your eyes. You've never seen anything like it.

tSid 6.7's resulting head is slightly off center. His skin

tcatches sight of her, and goes after her.

</b>
tMadison crawls into a darkened engineer's station and hides.
tShe is still very dizzy. And trying to keep the sound of her
tbreathing to a minimum.

tSid 6.7 enters quietly. A hunter on the prowl. Moving very
tslowly. Then lunging very swiftly. He continues the hunt.

tIf Madison is discovered, she doesn't have a prayer. Her
theart pounds. Her forehead perspires. Sid 6.7 is getting
tcloser.

tSid 6.7 checks inside closets. Cabinets. Anywhere large

<b>ttttGUEST CONDUCTOR (0. 5.)
</b>ttt(German accent)
ttIt won't do any good to rush me. I
ttneed my time to prepare myself.

tThe door is opened by the GUEST CONDUCTOR, who is dressed in
ta tuxedo, as well as large earrings. His hair is long and
tred. His complexion is pale, nearly white. And his eyes are
tpiercing green. You might describe this look as punk meets
tclassical.

<b>ttttGUEST CONDUCTOR
</b>ttt(annoyed beyond belief)
ttAre you just going to stand there,
ttor do you want something?

tShaking with concentration, Sid 6.7 turns his hair red.
t(Nanox97organisms can do this, as well as the following.) He
tthen grabs his hair and pulls it out, extending it to the
texact length of the guest conductor's. 

tSid 6.7 then changes his complexion to match the conductor's.
tAs well as his eye color, and other facial features. The
tGuest Conductor can't believe his eyes.

tBy the time Sid 6.7 is finished modifying himself, he may not
tbe an exact duplicate of the guest conductor, but even his
tmother would have to look twice.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttIt's show time.

tHe shoves the Guest Conductor back into his Dressing Room.
tSid 6.7 follows him in, revealing a suppressed .38. He SLAMS
tthe door behind him.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINSIDE THE SQUAD CAR
</b>
tMadison speeds recklessly through traffic toward the
tHollywood Bowl. Parker doesn't notice. He's totally focused
ton screaming into the police radio.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttListen to me, a bomb is planted
ttsomewhere in the Hollywood Bowl!
ttEvacuate everybody!

<b>ttttFEMALE VOICE
</b>ttI'm sorry, sir, I don't have the
ttauthorization to do that.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttThen put somebody on who does!

<b>ttttMALE VOICE
</b>ttWhat's seems to be the problem?

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttYou've got to stop the concert! A
ttbomb is going to go off!

<b>ttttMALE VOICE
</b>ttI'm sorry, sir, the concert has
ttalready started.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTHE GUEST CONDUCTOR
</b>
twhose back is to the audience, leading the orchestra in a
ttruly magnificent performance of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony
tinside the Hollywood Bowl.

tThe Guest Conductor waves his baton wildly. Passionately.
tBrilliantly. Getting the absolute best from the members of
tthe orchestra.

tThe musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed to
ttheir musical limit.

tAs the Guest Conductor turns to the next page of his sheet
tmusic on the podium, you notice seven small, HIGH-FREQUENCY
tSENSORS above an upcoming musical measure.

tThe sensors are wired together. When the seven notes are
tplayed in sequence, an electrical pulse will be triggered
tdown the wires which run down the side of the podium, beneath
tthe stage.

<b>tBENEATH THE STAGE
</b>
tThe wires connect to several crates of Cx974 positioned beneath
tthe orchestra. These seven notes will be the last notes these
tmusicians ever play.

<b>tttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tOUTSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</b>
tMadison SCREECHES the vehicle to a halt. She comes within
tinches of mowing down several people. Madison and Parker bolt
tto the entrance, flashing their badges to the guards.

<b>tINSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</b>
tThe Guest Conductor's movements grow even more intense. More
tdemanding. As he looks to the violin section, we now see the
tconductor's face. It is Sid 6.7.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(silently)
ttDon't hold back...Give it to me.
ttGive it to me!

tThe orchestra plays with everything they've got. They hit
tevery note perfectly. Including a high C.

<b>tON THE CONDUCTOR'S PODIUM
</b>
tThe first sensor is triggered. Then the second.

<b>tPARKER AND MADISON
</b>
tappear at the back of the stage. Guns raised. Distracting the
tmusicians. As Parker and Madison charge through the horn
tsection toward Sid 6.7, the musicians stop playing.

<b>tON THE CONDUCTOR'S PODIUM
</b>
tThe fifth sensor is triggered. Then the sixth...But not the
tseventh.

<b>tSID 6.7
</b>
tcannot believe his eyes. Or his ears. The entire orchestra
thas stopped.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttCome on, play! PLAY!

tIn his rage, his face contorts "past points", which can only
tbe described bizarre, frightening, and not, something you
twould ever like to see when you look in the mirror.

tThe musicians stare at Sid 6.7, and then at Parker and
tMadison with concerned, confused silence. Which is broken by
tParker's gunfire.

tDucking behind the podium, Sid 6.7 desperately tries to
trewire the sensors to trigger manually. Without luck. He
ttakes his .38 out of his jacket and starts firing.

tPandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl. Audience
tmembers run in every direction.

tThe members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but
tkeep their instruments with them. Even the oboist.

tPreventing Parker and Madison from taking any further shots
tat Sid 6.7.

tSid 6.7 bolts down into the crowd. Madison cannot get off a
tclean shot. Neither can Parker. He aims, but does NOT fire.
tHe and Madison struggle through the crowd after him.

<b>tOUTSIDE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</b>
tParker and Madison just catch a glimpse of Sid 6.7 as he
trushes up the entrance ramp to the Hollywood Freeway. Parker
tand Madison bolt after him.

<b>tON THE HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY
</b>
tParker and Madison race past the cars waiting to merge into
twhat is effectively a parking lot. As is normal for this
tthoroughfare, traffic is at a standstill.

tSid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen. Parker and Madison splitx97up,
twading through different lanes of traffic. Startling the
talready frustrated motorists. Who roll up their windows. Lock
ttheir doors. And some of whom reveal weapons of their own.

tMadison pauses, listening. She has no idea that Sid 6.7 steps
tbehind her. WHAM! He cold cocks her with the butt of his gun.
tMadison crumples to the street.

tWhich now leaves Parker a clean shot at Sid 6.7's head. BOOM!
tBOOM! Two hits. Two head wounds. Sid 6.7 falls behind a
ttruck, losing his weapon.

tBefore Sid 6.7's wounds have finished regenerating, Parker is
talready on top of him.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttt(neighborly)
ttHey, old buddy, old pal, good to
ttsee you again.

tHe empties his clip into Sid 6.7, then discards the gun. As
tSid 6.7's wounds heal themselves, Parker pounds him
tmercilessly.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(losing it)
ttYou...ruined...I'M GOING TO KILL
<b>ttYOU!!!
</b>
tTrading blows, he manages to get to his feet.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttNow, is that any way to talk to an
ttold friend?

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(exploding)
<b>ttBARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
</b>
tHe knocks Parker back with a good shot to the face, then
tdisappears around a van.

tParker continues the hunt. Quietly. Carefully. Tension grows
tin the silence that follows.

tHe carefully makes his way around a truck. Only to see Sid
t6.7 swinging a two-by-four directly at his head. WHAM!!!

tParker is knocked on his ass. Daze4. Blood streams down his
tcheek. He staggers to his feet, blocking another blow with
this arm. Which SNAPS the wood in two.

tParker grabs one of the boards. He battles with Sid 6.7.

tThe fight between Parker and Sid 6.7 is intense. Exhausting.

tParker gives it everything he has.

tMadison appears behind Parker, holding his gun. She wavers,
thaving trouble keeping her balance. She has even more trouble
taiming her weapon.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttHey, Parker...

tShe moves around, trying to get a clean shot at Sid 6.7.
tWhich she does not have.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttHow's your pulse?

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttt(totally focused)
ttI couldn't tell you.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttThen shoot him already.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttDuck!

tWithout hesitation, Parker hits the deck. Leaving Sid 6.7
tcompletely exposed. Madison steadies her sight.

<b>ttttSID 6.7
</b>ttt(to Madison)
ttYou couldn't hit the side of a...

tAs he raises his twox97byx97four high over Parker's head, Madison
tpulls the trigger smoothly.

tIN SLOW MOTION, you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel
tof her gun. And penetrates Sid 6.7's skull between the eyes
tand exits out the back of his head.

tSid 6.7 collapses on the ground next to Parker.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttWhat do we do now?

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttYou won't want to watch. Turn
ttaround.

tShe does so. Parker reaches OUT OF FRAME to remove the Sid
t6.7 character module from within his skull. Then reveals the
tcharacter module in hand.

<b>ttttMADISON
</b>ttWhat should we do with it?

tGlancing in the flatbed of a truck, Parker gets an idea, and
tknocks on the driver's window. As the DRIVER rolls down his
twindow, classic ROCK & ROLL MUSIC can be heard from inside.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttMind if I borrow a couple of your
tttools for a second?

<b>ttttDRIVER
</b>ttBe my guest.

tParker removes two sledgehammers from the back of the truck.
tHe offers one to Madison.

<b>ttttPARKER
</b>ttCare to join me?

tMadison gladly accepts takes the sledgehammer. Parker drops
tthe Sid 6.7 character module onto the pavement. And together,
tthey start pounding the shit out of it. WHAM! WHAM! In
tperfect time with the music. Which the driver cranks even
tlouder. As we ROLL CREDITS.
