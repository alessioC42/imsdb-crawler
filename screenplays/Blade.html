tDarkness, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS. Presentation credits roll as we
<b>tFADE UP ON:
</b>
<b>tINT. HOSPITAL, INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - NIGHT
</b>
tIt's 1967, the Summer of Love and --

tBOOM! Entry doors swing open as PARAMEDICS wheel in a FEMALE BLEEDER,
tVANESSA (20s, black, nine months pregnant). She's deathly pale,
tspewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat -- 

tA SHOCK-TRAUMA TEAM swarms over her, inserting a vacutainer into an
tartery to draw blood, wrapping a blood pressure cuff around her
tarm --

<b>ttttNURSE #1
</b>ttt(with stethoscope)
ttShe's not breathing!

<b>ttttSENIOR RESIDENT
</b>ttIntubate her!

tThe RESPIRATORY THERAPIST feeds an endotracheal tube down the woman's
truined throat, attaches that to an Amblu bag --

<b>ttttRESIDENT
</b>ttBlood-pressure's forty and falling --

tThe woman starts spasming violently. It takes three staff members
tjust to hold her down.

<b>ttttSENIOR RESIDENT
</b>ttJesus, her water's broken --
ttt(calling for help)
ttShe's going into uterine contractions --

tCAMERA PUSHES IN on the woman as she bolts upright, SCREAMING to wake
tthe dead. We PLUNGE INTO the darkness of her mouth and find
tourselves --

<b>tINSIDE HER BLOODSTREAM
</b>
tThe sound of a HEART BEATING, pounding as we whip-snake through --

<b>tCORPUSCLES 
</b>
tfloating in amber plasma. Erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils and
teosinophils. 

tThe rhythmic expansion of the artery walls, pulsing with each
tsuccessive surge of blood as the HEART BEATS FASTER AND FASTER,
ttaking us --

<b>tIN UTERO,
</b>
tA CHILD, alive but unborn, shifting in a sea of amniotic fluid,
tsurrounded by the white, protective substance known as vernix
tcaseosa. The HEARTBEAT races like a locomotive now. The unborn child
tshifts, turns its head towards us --

t-- and opens its eyes.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tA SWORDBLADE
</b>
tcleaving the darkness, radiant light slicing across gleaming Damascus
tsteel. Words acid-etched in the weapon's fine-tempered surface:

<b>tBLADE
</b>
tMain credits end.

<b>tEXT. INNER CITY, INDUSTRIAL GHETTO - NIGHT
</b>
tA decaying no man's land populated by condemned buildings and HUNGRY
tHOMELESS. Steam rises from manhole covers, drifting across the
tlitter- lined streets. Suddenly --

tA black Mercedes 850 appears over the crest of a hill, ROARING past
tus, stereo system belting out FILTER.

<b>tINT. MERCEDES - NIGHT
</b>
tRaquel, a wasp-wasted woman, sits behind the wheel. 20s, rich,
tsickeningly attractive. Hungry eyes. 

tSquirming around in the passenger seat is DENNIS, a model/actor boy-
ttoy with a sub-zero IQ and a "fuck me sideways" grin. 

<b>ttttDENNIS
</b>ttSo where we going?

<b>ttttRAQUEL
</b>ttIt's a surprise. 

<b>ttttDENNIS
</b>ttI likes surprises. 

tRaquel eyeballs Dennis -- "if looks could devour". 

<b>ttttRAQUEL
</b>ttWhat do you have down there, little 
ttman?

<b>ttttDENNIS
</b>ttHeat-seeker.

<b>ttttRAQUEL
</b>ttI'll bet.

tRaquel slides a manicured hand up his thigh, squeezes his groin.
tDennis MOANS. She pulls her hand away, downshifts.

<b>tEXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
</b>
tThe 850 threads a narrow alley into a vacant lot, BRAKES hard. Raquel
tand Dennis climb out. She leads him into --

<b>tEXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT
</b>
tIndustry never sleeps, and certainly not this grisly facility. Raquel
tleads Dennis around the back of the plant, where a host of WORKERS
tare loading refrigerated trucks with product.

<b>ttttDENNIS
</b>ttWhat the fuck are we doing here?

tRaquel just smiles, heads on into the plant via a loading door. The
tworkers ignore her.

<b>tINT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT
</b>
tDennis follows Raquel through the bowels of the plant, catching
tglimpses here and there of carcasses being rendered or hacked apart. 

tThrough one partially open door we see what might be a line of
tBODYBAGS being trundled into the back of a truck via a hook and chain
tpulley-system. But Dennis doesn't have enough time to be disturbed by
tthe vision, because he's being pulled away by Raquel, led down --

<b>tA STAIRWELL
</b>
tWe are in the basement now. At the end of the hall is a steel door,
twith perhaps, just the faintest HINT OF MUSIC heard coming from
tbeyond. Raquel knocks.

tA "peep-hole" slat opens and a BLACK LIGHT shines into Raquel's eyes.
tA VOICE behind the door offers a verbal challenge, speaking a
tlanguage we've never heard, laced with a devilish cadence. 

tRaquel responds in kind. The door opens. Raquel gives Dennis a
tknowing wink, enters. Dennis follows. 

<b>tINT. CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
tRaquel and Dennis move past a hulking DOORMAN, making their way down
ta narrow stairway. Dennis is suitably impressed.

<b>tTHE CLUB 
</b>
tis elite, underground -- an "abattoir-chic" version of an old-time
tjuke joint with a greasy, dangerous vibe. White-tiled walls and
tfloors for easy hosing, chromed fittings, run-off gutters, drains. No
tbar.

<b>tBODIES 
</b>
twrithe on the strobe-lit dance floor. A heavy S&M scene. Leather.
tLatex. Tattoos. Body-piercings.

tA D.J. wearing head-mounted spotlights orchestrates the tunes on
ttwin- decks. MUSIC assaults us -- a beat so heavy it could jar the
tfillings from your teeth. Brutal "DARKCORE" along the lines of
tProdigy or Underground. 

tRaquel pulls Dennis out onto the dance floor. They sway. 

tA lupine-featured GAULTIER GIRL with a streak of white running
tthrough her raven hair moves in behind Dennis, pressing up against
thim. Rachel Williams as the Angel of Death -- we'll call her MERCURY.

tMercury flicks her tongue against Dennis' ear -- it's been pierced
twith a silver post which clicks against her teeth. Tattooed across
ther back in black is a swirling, tribal vortex. 

tDennis is now sandwiched between Raquel and Mercury, the three of
tthem dry-humping their way to every man's glory. 

tThe beat gets LOUDER. The action heavier. The atmosphere more
tnarcotic. People are stripping off their clothes, sweating like
tfiends. It's a virtual orgy.

tDennis laughs, reveling in the hedonism. Everything rises to a fever
tpitch --

<b>ttttDENNIS
</b>ttt(over the music)
ttFuck, I need a drink!!!

tRaquel just smiles -- then Dennis notices a DROP OF SOMETHING spatter
this hand. It looks like blood. Dennis looks up, concerned --

t-- MORE BLOOD DROPLETS are falling. Raquel's face is sprinkled with
tthem now. Dennis stops dancing. What is this? Some kind of fucked up
tperformance art?

tRaquel turns her face toward the ceiling, as if washing herself in a
tsummer shower, now the other club goers are looking up too --

<b>tBLOOD SHOWERS DOWN
</b>
tfrom sprinkler heads in the ceiling, drenching the dancers. The club
tgoers love it, thrusting their heads back, mouths open wide to
treceive the crimson offering. 

tHorrified, Dennis recoils, turning towards --

<b>tRAQUEL,
</b>
twhose face morphs into a preternatural snarl. Her canines extend,
ttapering to razor-sharp points. Her tongue flicks, lizard-like as
tfingernails sharpen into claws. All this while the whites of her eyes
tBLEED RED, pupils oscillating hypnotically. 

<b>ttttRAQUEL
</b>ttWhat's wrong, baby?

tDennis SCREAMS, pushes away from Raquel, only --

t-- Mercury has fangs now too. In fact, everyone in the club does,
twith the exception of poor Dennis. That's because they're all
tvampires.

tDennis tries to run, but the burly Doorman blocks his exit, brutally
tsmashing his fist into Dennis' face. 

tDennis falls, dazed. The club-goers close in around him. They make a
tgame of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces
tleering like twisted jack-o-lanterns.

tThe strobe lights quicken to a seizure-inducing intensity. Dennis
tspins, tumbling into Raquel's arms. She shoves him forward -- Dennis
tlands on the floor, falling at someone's boot-clad feet. He looks up.
tA DARK FIGURE sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. The
tfigure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt -- 

<b>tA BLACK MAN, 
</b>
ttowers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a
tsneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of
thorror. His name is BLADE.

tBlade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an
tarsenal of high-tech weapons strapped to his body: 

t6-point adjustable body armor, a modified CAR-15 assault rifle with
tan ultra-violet entry light, two Casull .454 revolvers, a "Demon"
tautomatic cross-bow, a bandoleer of mahogany stakes, an Indian-style
tkatar punching dagger -- and last, but certainly not least, his
tnamesake -- a silver sword which is secured in a back-scabbard.

<b>tCLOSE ON BLADE
</b>
tA gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers
tstare back. Nuclear silence. And then --

tAll hell breaks loose. With a SNARL, Raquel charges at Blade, moving
tat superhuman speed, practically a blur -- 

tBlade draws his Casulls, FIRES in multiple directions --

<b>tMACRO BULLET SHOT 
</b>
tas a round roars through the air towards Raquel. A silver-tipped dum-
tdum bullet which explodes on contact.

tWHAM! The round punches a fist-sized hole through Raquel's chest,
tcontinuing on into the vamp behind her! Vampire blood fountains. Both
tcreatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of
tblack oil which go gurgling down the run-off drains.

tBlade continues FIRING, then -CLICK!- magazines empty. Next. He
tholsters the Casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on
tthe UV entry light mounted above --

<b>tMERCURY 
</b>
tleaps twenty feet straight up into the air. We've never seen anything
tmove so fast. She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into
tthe night just as --

t-- a shaft of blinding UV "sunlight" cuts across the vampires. They
trear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade
topens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets
tinto the crowd -- vampire genocide.

tThe strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires
ttry to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes
tclogged with liquefying bodies -- 

t-- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their
topening, surge forward en masse -- 

tBlade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!-
tunsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip. 

<b>tTHE SWORD
</b>
tFour acid-etched feet of blood-soaked Damascus steel. An edge so
tsharp it could cleave a shadow in two.

tBlade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING
tVAMPIRES. Blade spins again, cuts ANOTHER VAMPIRE clean in half --

<b>tON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB,
</b>
ta LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword,
tsending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the
tvampire's heart. The hellish creature convulses, dies.

tBeat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses --

<b>tSOMETHING BIG
</b>
trising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward,
tcutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. The severed limb
tfalls to the floor -- 

t-- but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. It SLAMS into
tBlade. Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables,
tslamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the
tceiling. 

tBlade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot-
tsomething nightmare named QUINN. The vampire rears back its head,
tjaws stretching wide. Every inch of his face is covered with ritual
tscarification patterns and Maori-like tribal tattoos. 

tBlade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at
tbay. With his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a
tstake -- CRUNCH! Blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx.
tQuinn gurgles, clutches at his throat. 

tBlade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross-bow secured to his
tleg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open,
tdrawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES -- 

tThe bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and
tnailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to
tpull out the stake --

tBlade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm,
teffectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board.

<b>tUP ABOVE, 
</b>
tmounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. Blade fires a
tcross-bow bolt straight into the lens. 

tBlade strides over, placing his sword against Quinn's chest.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWhere is Deacon Frost?

tQuinn glares, trying to speak, gagging on the stake still lodged in
this trachea --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttGot something in your throat.

tBlade yanks the stake free. The vampire laughs, air whistling through
this ruined larynx. 

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttFuck you, Day-walker, I ain't saying 
ttshit --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttFrost.

tQuinn responds with a slew of rapid-fire vampire invectives. Blade
tsees he's getting nowhere fast, calmly sheathes his sword. He unclips
ta white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness -- 

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttYou won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's 
ttrising, the Sleeper's gonna --

tBlade shoves the grenade in Quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. WHOOSH!
tQuinn goes up like a roman candle. Blade turns, surveying his work,
tignoring the howling pyre behind him:

tAll evidence of the vampires is gone -- with the exception of a few
toily-black puddles. Clothes, jewelry -- it's all been burned away by
tthe acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition.

tDENNIS sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. As Blade
tapproaches, he cringes back --

<b>ttttDENNIS
</b>ttPlease don't --

tBlade simply grabs Dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward,
trotating it from side to side -- looking for bite marks. There aren't
tany.

tBlade moves on, leaving Dennis alone amidst the carnage. As Blade
tstarts up the stairs, he pauses in mid-step --

<b>tA COCKROACH
</b>
tscurries out from underfoot. 

tBlade adjusts his footfall, sparing the roach. He continues on up the
tstairs, disappearing in the smoky haze. 

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CITY HOSPITAL, AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tCAMERA FOLLOWS a bagged corpse as it's rolled into the autopsy room
tby an ASSISTANT. 

<b>ttttASSISTANT
</b>ttBrought you a baked potato, nice
ttand crispy. Still warm, too.

tCURTIS WEBB, the forensic pathologist (30s, white bread, a little on
tthe smarmy side) steps forward, unzips the bag --

tIt's Quinn, what's left of him, anyway. Burnt to a charcoal
tbriquette, limbs twisted horribly, oozing fluids.

tCurtis turns his head, grimacing, wafting the air.

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttJesus, that's rank -- 

tCurtis turns back, makes note of the blackened stump where Quinn's
tarm used to be, the ruined throat -- 

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttWhat's his story?

<b>ttttASSISTANT
</b>ttParamedics said he was still screaming 
ttwhen they found him. Looks like some 
ttjoker had stapled him to a wall.

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttPretty.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. HOSPITAL, HEMATOLOGY LAB - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tMICROSCOPE POV
</b>
tof a slide-mounted blood smear stained with Wright stain (blue ink).
tWhat we see is a collection of donut-shaped pink things (red blood
tcells) intermingled with some small blue specks (platelets) and the
toccasional larger, light-blue blobs (white blood cells).

tKAREN JANSEN (20s), a fine-featured hematologist with a social life
tin suspended animation, sits back from the microscope, stumped. Next
tto her is JULIE WHITAKER, a cheerful chemtech. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou took this off a DOA?

tCurtis sits on a stool nearby, slowly nodding.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttThis isn't human blood.

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttThen what is it?

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttI don't know --
ttt(re: microscope)
ttLook at this blood smear -- 

tCurtis takes a look for himself.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttThe red blood cells are biconvex, 
ttwhich is theoretically impossible. 
ttThey're hypochromic, there's virtually 
ttno hemoglobin in them. 
ttt(shaking her head)
ttLook at the PMNs, they're binucleated, 
ttthey should be mononucleated.

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttWhat about the chemistry panel? 

tKaren looks to Julie, who reaches for a computer print-out.

<b>ttttJULIE
</b>ttBlood sugar level is three times the 
ttnorm, phosphorous and uric acid are 
ttoff the scales.
ttt(shrugs)
ttLike the woman said, impossible.

tKaren removes her glasses, rubbing the bridge of her nose.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttCurtis, it's three in the morning. I'm 
ttreally not in the mood for one of your 
ttpractical jokes.

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttt(insistent)
ttIt's not a joke. I've got the stiff 
ttsitting in the morgue right now -- 
ttlook, just come up and see him, okay? 
ttFive minutes, that's all I ask.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttI thought you promised to give me some 
ttdistance?

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttThis is purely professional curiosity, 
ttKaren, I swear.

tKaren rolls her eyes, lets loose a tired sigh.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttFive minutes, not a second more. And I 
ttdon't want to hear a word about "us".

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttNo problem.

<b>tINT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe dead of night, not a mouse in the house. Curtis and Karen, each
tgarbed in a mask, stand on either side of Quinn's body, which now
trests on the autopsy table.

<b>tQUINN'S BODY
</b>
tA preliminary exploratory Y-incision has been made across the chest,
tstretching from shoulder to shoulder, then continuing on down the
tabdomen. Ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart
tand lungs.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou haven't started in on the internal 
ttorgans?

<b>ttttCURTIS 
</b>ttJust the blood sample from the 
ttpericardial sac.

tCurtis pauses, studying Quinn's disfigured face -- the features seem
tmuch less damaged now -- almost as if the corpse were healing itself.

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttThat's weird --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttHe looks different now, burns are less 
ttextreme, some of these wounds have 
ttclosed up -- 

tCurtis pulls out a penlight, flicks it on. He leans over Quinn,
tshining the light into one of his eyes.

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttTell me something, honestly, you ever 
tthave second thoughts about us?

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(grudgingly)
ttSometimes --

tCurtis looks up from the corpse, grinning beneath his mask.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>tt-- but then I remember what an 
ttass-hole you were and I'm snapped back 
ttto reality. 

<b>ttttCURTIS
</b>ttJesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart 
tthere --

tQuinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs
tinto Curtis' jugular. He snaps the man's neck in two for easier
taccess, sucking in blood like a living vacuum. 

tKaren stumbles backwards, sending autopsy tools CLATTERING.

<b>tQUINN
</b>
trises from the table, flinging Curtis' twitching body aside. He curls
this blood-soaked lips back, baring viper-like fangs, emitting a
<b>tGUTTURAL GROWL --
</b>
<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttt(crazed by thirst)
tt-- more -- blood --

tKaren backs into the corpse drawers, but Quinn is upon her in a half-
tsecond, wrapping a hand about her throat. His mouth opens/morphs
tdisturbingly wide as if to swallow her head whole, caustic saliva
tdripping from his canines -- 

tKaren tries to turn her head away, but Quinn's grip is vise-like. She
tfinds herself staring into his eyes -- pupils pulsing rapid-fire,
topening and closing, hypnotic --

tAs Quinn sinks the tips of his fangs into Karen's carotid artery and
tstarts to nurse --

tBANG!!! A load of MAHOGANY buckshot chews into Quinn's side. He HOWLS
tin pain. Another load catches him full in the face. He drops Karen.
tShe falls to the floor -- 

<b>tKAREN'S POV
</b>
tThe sound of RUSHING BLOOD pounding through her skull. Everything
tspinning. She struggles to move, turns her head, finds herself eye to
teye with Curtis' corpse.

<b>tON QUINN
</b>
trising, his face torn up, smoking. WHIP PAN TO --

<b>tBLADE, 
</b>
tstanding at the entrance to the morgue, a streetsweeper auto-shotgun
tin hand, sizing Quinn up.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttNow don't we look dapper?

tQuinn BELLOWS with rage, ripping one of the heavy steel refrigeration
tdoors from its hinges, flinging it at Blade like it was lawn
tfurniture --

tBlade rolls to the side as the door CRASHES against the wall. Quinn
truns, moving through the morgue like a human tornado, heading for the
twindows at the end of the room --

tSMASH!!! Out goes Quinn, taking half the wall with him. Blade rushes
tto the decimated window, looks down --

<b>tBLADE'S POV
</b>
tQuinn lands on the roof of an ambulance parked four stories below,
tcaving it in. He springs off, loping across the tarmac on three
tlimbs, then -SCREECH!-THWUMP!- rolling up onto the hood of an
toncoming car, before disappearing into the night --

<b>tBACK UP ABOVE,
</b>
tBlade spins, SEES Karen bleeding her life away on the floor. She
treaches a hand out to him, beseeching --

tBlade pulls away from her grasp, takes a step towards the exit --
tthen hesitates. 

tA flicker of doubt washes across Blade's face. He looks down at Karen
tonce more, wrestling with his conscience, finally making a decision.
tHe kneels, scoops Karen up into his arms. Just then, 

<b>tTWO POLICEMEN 
</b>
trush into the morgue, weapons drawn --

<b>ttttUNIFORM #1
</b>ttHold it, ass-hole!

tBlade ignores them, turning to face the window before him. It's a
tgood thirty feet to the roof of the adjacent building, a parking
tstructure -- and damned if Blade doesn't seem to be considering the
tjump.

tThe Police close in, agitated. Blade crouches, switches Karen to a
tone-handed grip --

<b>ttttUNIFORM #1
</b>ttI said hold it!!!

t-- and jumps.

<b>tEXT. HOSPITAL/ROOFTOP PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade clears the impossible distance -- almost. He snags the ledge of
tthe adjacent parking structure with his left hand even as Karen slips
tfrom the grasp of his right --

t-- a last-second save, his fingers clamping around her wrist, is all
tthat stands between Karen and street pizza. She SCREAMS anyway,
tdangling below him --

tBlade GRUNTS, swinging Karen like a pendulum, heaving her up and over
tthe ledge as if she were a sack of potatoes. She lands on her
tshoulder, clutching it in pain --

tBlade heaves himself up, crouching beside her.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(gasping)
ttMy shoulder -- dislocated --

tBlade places a hand on her shoulder, another around her elbow and
twithout any consideration to discomfort -CRACK!- brutally pops it
tback in place. Karen SCREAMS again as he scoops her up once more and
theads for --

<b>tHIS '69 OLDSMOBILE 442, 
</b>
twhich is parked nearby. Midnight-black. The definitive high-
tperformance heavy-metal muscle machine with an engine big enough to
tpower an Apollo rocket. 

<b>tINT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade sets Karen down in the passenger seat, climbs behind the wheel,
tkeys the ignition. The engine ROARS to life, belching fumes through
tthe dual exhaust. Blade floors it, burning serious rubber as the Olds
tvanishes from sight. 

<b>tBACK AT THE DEMOLISHED MORGUE WINDOW 
</b>
tas the two policemen stare numbly in open-mouthed astonishment.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade pilots the Olds down the streets, moving through a series of
tincreasingly degenerating neighborhoods, coming at last to the
tsprawling warehouse district.

<b>tEXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT 
</b>
tThe Olds approaches a mammoth industrial facility that's been
tcordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire. Ultra-violet
tfloodlights illuminate the area, while an army of security cameras
tkeep a watchful eye. 

<b>tINT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade glances at Karen, cursing himself for giving into his emotions.
tHe hits a remote secured to the sun visor --

<b>tEXT. BLADE'S OLDS/ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
tA gate grinds open. 

tWe follow the Olds as it cruises around the back of the building,
theading down a concrete loading ramp. At the bottom of the ramp, a
theavy iron door rises. Blade's Olds disappears into the darkness.

<b>tINT. ABANDONED FACTORY, INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
tMore UV lights flicker on. We're in a massive loading elevator which
tHUMS as it ascends, eventually reaching its destination with a
tBOOMING CLANG. The doors at the rear glide open. Blade guides the
tOlds out.

<b>tINT. ABANDONED FACTORY, WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
</b>
tSet up in an old ironworks, the place looks like a cross between an
tauto junkyard and an armory. Equipment is strewn everywhere --
tlathes, mills, old furnaces, gutted vehicles, an ad hoc surgical
ttheater -- all of it jerry-rigged in a brutal, oily-tech.

tBlade climbs out of the Olds. He opens the passenger door and pulls
tKaren out, carries her in his arms. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWhistler!

<b>ttttWHISTLER (O.S.)
</b>ttAre we bringing home strays now?

tABRAHAM WHISTLER (60s)

thobbles out of the shadows, leaning heavily on a cane. Gimlet-eyed,
tbitter, his right leg encased in a metal brace. Though his face is
tlined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray, we sense
the could kick the living shit out of any man half his age. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttShe's been bitten.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttYou should've killed her, then.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttShe hasn't turned yet. 
ttt(pointedly)
ttYou can help her.

tBlade and Whistler stare each other down. Finally, Whistler turns and
theads over to the operating theater.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttNo promises. You watch her close. She 
ttstarts to turn, you finish her off.

tBlade nods, lays Karen down on the operating table. Whistler turns on
tan overhead light. Karen is sheathed in sweat, ashen. She's lost a
tlot of blood.

tWhistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves, probes the wound in
tKaren's neck with an antiseptic swab -- there's capillary damage
taround the perimeter of the wound, the tissue looks bruised,
tgangrenous. 

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttLocalized necrosis. She's borderline. 
ttAnother hour and she'd be well into 
ttthe change.

tWhistler cracks open a smelling salt capsule and waves under Karen's
tnose. As she starts to stir --

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttCan you hear me, woman? 

tKaren's eyes open wide. She's scared, disoriented --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat -- ?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttYou've been bitten by a vampire. We've 
ttgot to try and burn out the venom, 
ttjust like a rattlesnake bite --

tWhistler reaches for a massive syringe filled with caustic-looking
tfluid. Karen sees the syringe, resists --

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttHold her. 

tBlade forces Karen back. Whistler readies the syringe.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttt(reading her name tag)
tt"Dr. Karen Jansen". Listen close, I'm 
ttgoing to inject you with an antidote 
ttmade from allium setivum -- garlic. 
ttThis is going to hurt. A lot. 

tWhistler sinks the needle into Karen's neck and depresses the
tplunger. "Hurt" doesn't begin to describe what Karen experiences
tnext. Imagine undergoing childbirth while someone pumps battery acid
tthrough your veins.

tKaren SHRIEKS, her body going into uncontrolled paroxysms. The wound
ton her neck begins to smoke as the antidote attacks the poisonous
tvampire venom.

tKaren clutches at Blade's arms, digging her nails in. She stares up
tat him with unflinching intensity, like a child desperately searching
tfor assurance. 

<b>tON BLADE,
</b>
tuncomfortable playing the roll of nursemaid. He'd like nothing more
tthan to be done with this, but the only thing he can do is hold Karen
twhile she rides out the seizures. 

<b>tKAREN'S POV
</b>
tgrowing darker by the moment. The last thing she sees is Blade
tstaring down at her -- then the night closes in. 

<b>tINT. HOUSE OF EREBUS, MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tCLOSE ON a monitor featuring footage taken at the vampire club
tmassacre. Blade turns and stares into the camera, fires his cross-
tbow. The screen cuts to static.

<b>tA WITHERED, CLAWED HAND
</b>
tmoves into frame, holding a remote. With a tap of a button, the
tmonitor goes dark. 

tPULL BACK TO REVEAL a large, minimalist conference room -- the House
tof Erebus, seat of the vampire race's legislative assembly.

tGathered around a massive table are the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS,
trepresenting a "rainbow" of racial colors -- names like PALLINTINE,
tVON ESPER, ASHE, BAVA. Two of them, the FAUSTINAS, are identical
ttwins -- lethal-looking women with alabaster skin. 

tChilled carafes filled with blood are situated along the table. From
ttime to time, a member will pour themselves a glass, or perhaps, help
tthemselves to the bowls of human finger bones which serve as snacks.

tAt the head of the table is GAETANO DRAGONETTI, current vampire
t"Overlord". Blood-red eyes, parchment skin stretched over skull-like
tfeatures. Incalculably ancient, but still deadly and virile as a
tviper. 

tDragonetti speaks. He uses the "secret tongue" -- the ancient vampire
tlanguage which utilizes consonants human vocal chords are incapable
tof reproducing. 

<b>ttttDRAGONETTI

ttBlade. Once again, our interests have

ttYou're wrong, Dragonetti. 

tAll heads turn. Who would dare such impudence?

<b>tDEACON FROST, 
</b>
ta mere "Underlord" in the vampire hierarchy, steps forward.
tStrikingly handsome, younger, less conservative than his superiors,
tfueled with a passionate intensity. Amongst the vampire community
the's known as an agitator. He's also the vampire equivalent of a
tracial supremacist.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttThe Day Walker represents a unique

<b>ttttDRAGONETTI
</b>ttt(subtitled, taking umbrage)
ttDeacon Frost. You refuse to speak our

ttgutter-tongue, have you no respect 
ttfor tradition? 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWhy should I respect something which 
tthas outlived its purpose?

tThis causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires. Frost might as
twell have slapped Dragonetti in the face.

<b>ttttDRAGONETTI
</b>ttt(simmering)
ttI see. And what would you have us do 
ttwith this "half-breed"?

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttStudy him. Unlock the secrets of his 
ttDNA. He's the key we've been looking 
ttfor. 

<b>ttttDRAGONETTI
</b>ttHe is an abomination! 

tDragonetti slams his fist down, toppling a carafe, spilling blood
tacross the tabletop. Frost looks to the others --

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWhy should we spend our lives 
ttcringing from the daylight when his 
ttblood offers us an alternative? 
ttEnough talk. It's time we stepped out 
ttof the shadows!

tDragonetti looks apoplectic. ELDER PALLINTINE, a five-hundred year-
told vampire inhabiting the body of a prepubescent boy, interjects.

<b>ttttPALLINTINE
</b>ttYou're out of line, Frost.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttAm I? Or am I just the first to say 
ttout loud what we've all been 
ttthinking? 

tThe fact that no one answers is telling. Dragonetti glowers at the
tother Elders, sensing the tide turning.

<b>ttttDRAGONETTI
</b>ttThe shadows suit us, Frost. We've 
ttexisted this way for thousands of 
ttyears. Who are you to challenge our 
ttways?

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttSomeone who's sick of living off 
ttscraps. The coming age belongs to us, 
ttnot the humans! 
ttt(to the others)
ttWhen the final war between our races 
ttcomes, who do you want leading the 
ttcharge? 

tFrost stabs an accusing finger at the Overlord.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttSome withered up fossil ready to snap 
ttlike a brittle bone at the first sign 
ttof change?

tDragonetti GROWLS like an beast, raking his claws across the tyro
tvampire's face, knocking him to the ground. 

<b>ttttDRAGONETTI
</b>ttGet out!!!

tFrost picks himself up, touches the gashes on his cheek. Looks at his
tfingers, licks the blood from them. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttCareful, old fang. You might wake up 
ttone day and find yourself extinct.

tFrost smiles at Dragonetti and calmly exits the room.

<b>tINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP, BLADE'S CELL - DAY
</b>
tON KAREN as she comes to. Her wounds have been bandaged. She rises, a
tlittle shaky, takes in her surroundings -- She's in a spartan room,
tlike a monk's cell. On the wall is a collection of knives and
tdaggers. Some of them wooden, their hilts inscribed with bizarre-
tlooking runes. In the center of these weapons rests --

<b>tBLADE'S SWORD,
</b>
thanging like a cross in a chapel, dominating all else. Karen touches
tit. Then her eyes drop to a silver locket which dangles from the hilt
tby a tarnished chain. She reaches for it, opens it --

tThe locket features a photo, old and faded. It's the black woman we
tsaw in the prologue, Vanessa, standing in the sunshine. 

tKaren moves towards the door, cautious -- 

<b>tINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY
</b>
tWe hear VOICES now, coming from beyond a series of black-out
tcurtains. Karen pushes one aside and SEES --

<b>tBLADE
</b>
tstrapped into some kind of Inquisition-esque restraint chair. His
tshirt is off, his body slick with sweat. Whistler finishes strapping
tBlade in, then stands back, holding up a gas-powered pistol injector,
thesitant --

<b>ttttWHISTLER 
</b>ttI had to increase the dose. You're 
ttbuilding up a resistance to the 
ttserum --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(impatient)
ttJust do it, old man.

tWhistler nods, fitting Blade with a bite guard. Then he presses the
tpistol-injector against Blade's carotid artery. 

tBlade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard,
tveins cording in his neck. He clutches Whistler's hand, holding it
ttightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. To his
tcredit, Whistler never lets go.

tMentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs
tits violent course. We understand that these shared moments, oddly
tprivate in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire
thunters together. Finally, Blade slumps forward in his restraints,
texhausted. 

<b>tKAREN
</b>
tShe draws back, instinctively knowing that she's just witnessed
tsomething she shouldn't have. She looks for an exit, SEES another
tdoorway. She makes for it -- 

<b>tINT. WHISTLER'S LAB - TANK ROOM - DAY 
</b>
tA dusty, darkened hole of a room, no windows, just shadows, crumbling
tconcrete, rust stains, and --

<b>tA LARGE TANK
</b>
tfilled with swirling blood plasma, choked with electrical leads and
tbiomedical sensors. SOMETHING floats within, suspended in the murky
tfluid -- a child , two or three years of age, drifting about like a
tmedical oddity preserved in formaldehyde -- 

tTHUMP! The child SLAMS up against the glass. Karen backpedals,
tstartled. Its eyes are open now, pupils blown. It snarls, revealing a
tmouthful of razored fangs, trailing mouth-slime across the glass as
tit futilely tries to chew its way through to Karen.

tKaren stifles a sob, turning and running right into --

</b>ttI'm sorry, I --

<b>ttttWHISTLER (O.S.)
</b>ttWandered off the beaten path, Doctor?

tWhistler has entered the room from a second doorway. Karen looks from
tWhistler to Blade, trapped between them --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWho are you people?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttMy name is Abraham Whistler.
ttt(re: Blade)
ttThis is Blade. As for our little 
tthomunculus here --

tWhistler limps over to the tank, rapping his cane against it. The
tcreature snaps at it reflexively, following the silver tip back and
tforth like a fish after a lure.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>tt-- he's a vampire.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou're joking --

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttNot at all. You're looking at a prime 
ttspecimen of the homines nocturna. 

tWhistler toys with the feral creature, engaging in a certain amount
tof sadistic delight as its efforts grow increasingly more frenzied.
tSuddenly, it surges towards the top of the tank, clawing at the
tlid --

tKaren becomes alarmed -- but then a massive ELECTRICAL JOLT shocks
tthe creature back into submission. 

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttIf Blade hadn't brought you here, you 
ttwould've wound up like him.

tKaren brings a hand to her bandaged neck, recalling the events of the
tprevious night. She looks to Blade.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhy did you help me?

tBlade scowls, his gaze flickering to Whistler.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttStupidity.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttt(appraising her)
ttMaybe not. I did some checking, she's 
tta hematologist. Knowledge like that

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttIt's not worth the risk. We can't 
tttrust her.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttBecause you're tainted. The venom's 
ttstill inside you. You could still 
ttturn on us.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat happens then?

tBlade looks to Whistler -- as far as he's concerned, the debate's
tover.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttThen I have to take you out, just 
ttlike any other bloodsucker.

tBlade turns and exits. Whistler and Karen follow.

<b>tINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - DAY
</b>
tBeyond the grimy outer windows, we can see that the day is closing --
tlong shadows, amber light. Karen lingers in the doorway, reeling from
tinformation overload. 

tBlade begins suiting up for his nightly hunt -- strapping on body
tarmor, loading ammunition. He strings the tarnished locket around his
tneck as if it were an amulet that could ward off evil, then pauses to
tinspect a modified pistol, sighting down the length of it.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWe hunt them, moving from one city to 
ttthe next, tracking their migrations. 
ttThey're hard to kill. They tend to 
ttregenerate.

tCLACK! Blade pulls the trigger on an empty chamber, then checks his
tnext weapon --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(sarcastic)
ttSo what do you use, then? A stake?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttt(nodding)
ttSome of the old wives' tales are true

ttsilver, various types of wood. Feed 
ttthem garlic and they'll go into 
ttanaphylactic shock -- 

tWhistler picks up a customized rifle with a UV entry light, flicking
ton the beam.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>tt-- and of course there's always 
ttsunlight, ultra-violet rays. 

tKaren shakes her head, incredulous -- 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttAnd you honestly expect me to believe 
ttall this?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI don't care what you believe. I 
ttsaved your life once, I don't plan on 
ttmaking a habit of it. You want my 
ttadvice, you'll be out of the city by 
ttnightfall. If you're stupid enough to 
ttstay, that's your business.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttI can't just leave. I have a life 
tthere, a career --

</b>ttNot anymore. You've seen one of them. 
ttYou won't be allowed to live after

tttried to keep it from spilling over 
ttonto the streets.

tsay. Karen is still protesting, though.

<b>ttttWHISTLER 
</b>ttYou're talking about a brotherhood

ttowards the Olds, gesturing.

tWhistler tosses a small metal canister to Karen.

tBut for now, the CAMERA DRIFTS through the warren of aisles. Along
tthe way, we catch a glimpse of a HULKING SILHOUETTE cowering behind a

tGideon tries to bring his pistol up -- but Blade grips the man's hand
tand squeezes. Gideon SCREAMS as his bones snap like kindling. The
tpistol falls from his grasp --

tBlade fires his fist into Gideon's gut again and again, then flings
tthe officer across the room, sending him SMASHING into a glass-cased
tcabinet. Bleeding, battered, Gideon struggles to stand --

tBlade is all over him, kicking the shit out of the rogue cop until he
tsinks to the floor in a half-conscious haze.

tBlade stands over Gideon's limp form, fists clenched, breathing

tto Karen --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou okay?

tKaren nods, glances at Gideon --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttHow did you know?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttFigured they'd send someone after you. 
ttThought I'd wait around and see who 
ttshowed up.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou used me as bait?!

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttIt worked, didn't it?

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttBut, he could've --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttHe didn't. Get over it.

tBlade kneels next to Gideon. He turns the man's head, inspects the
tneck, the skin behind the ear -- 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttBut he's a policeman --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttHe's a familiar. A human who works for 
ttthe vampires. See this mark?

tBlade pushes aside Gideon's hair, revealing a tiny, cryptic symbol
ttattooed into the man's scalp.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttThat's a glyph, kind of like a vampire 
ttcattle brand. That means Officer 
ttFriendly here is someone's property. 
ttAny of the other vampire's try to 
ttbleed him, they'll have to answer to 
ttFriendly's owner --
ttt(studying the glyph)
ttThis glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. 
ttWe've been tracking him for a while 
ttnow --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhy in God's name would anyone want to 
ttwork for them?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttBecause they're vampire wanna-bes. If 
ttthey're loyal, if they prove 
ttthemselves, then their masters will 
ttturn them. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttAnd that's a good thing?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttFor some. Live forever, never get old. 
ttThe ultimate high. 

tJust then, Gideon MOANS. Blade drags the man up so they're eye to
teye.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttHow 'bout you, Officer? You a good 
ttlittle bloodhound?

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. KAREN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK
</b>
tBlade and Karen are now standing by Gideon's police cruiser which is
tparked outside Karen's apartment. Blade shoves Gideon against the
thood of the cruiser. He finds Gideon's keys, moves to the trunk,
topens it --

<b>tIN THE TRUNK --
</b>
tA sophisticated medical cooling unit for transporting organs. Blade
topens the unit, coolant vapor hisses out. Inside are plastic bags
tcontaining blood. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttLooks like our friend was 
ttblood-running.
ttt(to Gideon)
ttWhere were you headed?

tGideon mumbles through a split lip and chipped teeth --

<b>ttttGIDEON
</b>ttMphuck you --

tWHAM! Blade plants Gideon's face into the hood of the car. Gideon
tGROANS, coughs --

<b>ttttGIDEON
</b>ttJesus -- 1227 Brookner -- 
ttHolliston Clinic --

tBlade releases him, then reaches for his Casull.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat are you doing?!

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttPreventive medicine.

tKaren steps in front of Blade, shielding Gideon.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou can't do this, he's human, it's 
ttmurder.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttIt's war, now get the fuck out of the 
ttway!

tKaren grabs Blade's arm, wrestling with him, trying to push his hand
taway. As the two of them struggle, Gideon makes a break for it,
tstumbling across the lawn. Blade pushes Karen aside, takes aim,
<b>tFIRES --
</b>
t-- but Gideon ducks into an alley, disappearing from sight. Blade
tspins on Karen, enraged --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttGod-damnit!!! Do you have any idea 
ttwhat you just did?! He'll warn them. 
ttThey'll be waiting!

tBut Karen's defiant, she's not backing down.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou were going to kill him. What was I 
ttsupposed to do?! Shut my eyes and 
ttpretend I didn't see what I saw? 

tBlade tears off his glasses. Karen gasps --

<b>tBLADE'S EYES
</b>
taren't human, nor are they vampire. They're something else -- emerald
tgreen, laced with swirling flecks of red. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttLet me set you straight on something, 
ttDoctor. What you've "seen" so far is 
ttnothing. The world you live in's just 
ttthe sugar-coated topping. There's 
ttanother world beneath it, the real 
ttworld -- and it's a fucking bloodbath. 
ttIf you want to survive in it, you'd 
ttbetter pull your head out of your ass. 

tBlade slips his glasses back on, leaving Karen shocked into silence.
tHe heads for his Olds without looking back, climbs in, guns the
tengine. In seconds, he's gone, tearing off down the street in a cloud
tof exhaust.

<b>tEXT. EDGEWOOD TOWERS, PENTHOUSE - DUSK
</b>
tWe are soaring through the air above the gleaming city skyline,
tmoving towards the Edgewood Towers whose windows reflect the blood-
tred sinking sun.

<b>tINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT
</b>
tSuffused lighting, elegant tile-work featuring evocative mosaics, the
tquiet strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC -- 

<b>tMERCURY,
</b>
tthe lupine Gaultier girl from the club, glides beneath the water,
tsurfacing at the deep end. We SEE --

<b>tFROST
</b>
tlounging in a chair, studying a laptop which rests beside him. On the
tscreen is a digitized image -- a page taken from an ancient
tmanuscript, written in a secret tongue.

tOfficer Gideon waits nearby, cradling his ruined hand, his battered
tface cast downward like a boy who's been called into the Principal's
toffice. 

<b>ttttGIDEON
</b>ttLook, I know you're disappointed --

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttCrestfallen.

<b>ttttGIDEON
</b>ttBlade was waiting for me. There wasn't 
ttanything I could do.

tFrost nods, lapsing into brooding contemplation.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttTell me something, Gideon, what blood 
tttype are you?

tGideon hesitates. Is this a trick question?

<b>ttttGIDEON
</b>ttI don't really know --

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttTake a wild stab. A? B? O, perhaps? 
ttI'm interested in the antigens here, 
ttthe agglutination reaction --

tGideon stammers as Frost rises. In the blink of an eye, Frost lifts
tGideon from the floor, dangling the Officer over the deep end of the
tpool by his throat --

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttI'm going to guess AB positive.

tGideon GURGLES as Frost's fingernails pierce his flesh, drawing
tblood. Then Frost releases him --

tGideon plunges into the pool. Mercury is on him in a heartbeat,
ttearing him apart like a Great White consuming a piece of chum. The
twater churns violently around them, clouding with red.

tWhen it's over, Mercury rises from the pool, dripping wet, covered
tfrom head to toe in a crimson sheen. 

tShe kisses Frost hungrily, letting Gideon's blood flow from her mouth
tto his. Frost flicks a tongue over his lips.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttAB positive. Give the man a prize.

tBelow them, Gideon's lifeless body sinks towards the pool bottom, his
tpolice badge twinkling like sunken treasure.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade's Olds cruises to a stop. We're in a low-end commercial
tdistrict -- junky heaven. Blade climbs out, pulling an automatic
trifle from the back seat, then heading into an alleyway. 

<b>tEXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade makes his way down the alley, cautious -- he SEES mountains of
ttrash, boarded-up windows, overlapping layers of gang graffiti -- a
tRAT crouching on a trash dumpster, gnawing on a dead pigeon --

t-- then a SOUND behind Blade, the scuffle of feet -- 

tBlade whirls, drawing his sword, CHARGING at an approaching shadow,
tstopping mere millimeters from decapitating --

<b>tKAREN,
</b>
twho's been backed up against the wall, her eyes wide with fright.
tBlade's sword vibrates from the tension in his forearm, having drawn
tjust the slightest taste of blood.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWhat the hell are you doing?! I could 
tthave killed you!

tBlade lowers his sword. Karen remembers to breathe. She slumps,
ttracing her fingers over the line where her head almost parted with
ther body.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttI remembered the address. I followed 
ttyou --

tBlade shakes his head, amazed.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttDo you have a death wish or are you 
ttjust stupid?

tKaren pushes away from the wall, angry --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttLook, if what you say is true, if 
ttthere's a chance I could turn into one 
ttof them, then I've got no choice, do 
ttI? I have to work with you. I need to 
ttlearn everything I can about them. 
ttIt's the only way I'll be able to find 
tta cure for myself.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttThere is no cure. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(defiant)
ttYou don't know that.

tBlade turns and moves to the end of the alley, studying the graffiti-
tcovered wall intently --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat are you looking at?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(gesturing)
ttWhat do you see here?

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttGraffiti --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttLook closer.

tBlade indicates a design amongst the various gang-banger tags that
tlooks something like a post-modern hieroglyphic.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttThis isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire 
ttmarking. It means there's a safe-house 
ttnearby. 
ttA place they can go if dawn is coming. 

tBlade points to a building across the street --

<b>tTHE HOLLISTON CLINIC,
</b>
tyour basic inner-city blood-barter establishment where desperate
ttransients parley their plasma into cash.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(recognizing it)
ttI know this place -- it's a blood 
ttbank. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttOwned by vampires. There's one of 
ttthese in every major city, and just 
ttlike Domino's, they always deliver.
ttt(looking to Karen)
ttYou telling me you're ready to walk 
ttthrough that door?

tKaren nods. Blade continues to stare at her, taking her measure --
tthere's a strength in this woman's eyes, she has the soul of a
tfighter -- and Blade recognizes it. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttAll right, then, listen up, Vampire 
ttAnatomy 101. Crosses and running water 
ttdon't do dick, so forget what you've 
ttseen in the movies. 

tBlade enumerates the following on his fingers:

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou use the stake, silver, or 
ttsunlight, got it? 

tBlade holds up one of his Casulls. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttKnow how to use one of these?

tKaren takes the weapon from him, eyes all over it.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttNo.

tBlade takes the gun back, snorting derisively.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttSafety's off, round's already 
ttchambered -- 
ttt(cocking it)
ttSilver hollow-points filled with 
ttgarlic. You aim for the heart or the 
tthead, anything else is a one-way 
ttticket to a pine box.

tBlade hand it to her again, then starts across the street towards the
tclinic. Karen follows --

<b>tINT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade enters, swinging his rifle around for all to see.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttGet out. Now.

tThe POTENTIAL DONORS scramble for the exit. Behind the counter,
tTANAKA, a male nurse, reaches for an alarm button. Blade vaults over
tthe counter, aiming his rifle. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI know you're blood-running. Who's 
ttyour sponsor? 

<b>ttttTANAKA
</b>ttI don't know what you're --

tPOW! Blade backhands him across the face hard enough to loosen his
tteeth. Karen flinches, stepping forward -- 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat if you've made a mistake?

tBlade pins Tanaka's head to the wall, turning it to the side --
trevealing the man's glyph. It's different than Gideon's, looking more
tlike a Japanese kanji character.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWhat's this? A birthmark?

tBlade grips Tanaka by his collar, shoving him through a doorway --

<b>tINT. HOLLISTON CLINIC, SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tKaren and Blade SEE supply cabinets, cots, a number of locked
trefrigeration units. Blade FIRES into the door handle of one of the
tunits, tears it open -- the fridge is stacked floor to ceiling with
tplastic packets of blood.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(to Karen)
ttStill think we might be wrong?
ttt(to Tanaka)
ttHow much are you shipping?

<b>ttttTANAKA
</b>ttBite me!

tBlade opens FIRE, sweeping his rifle around the room, shooting
teverything in sight. Glass cabinetry shatters, ampoules and
tvacutainers go flying. Tanaka cowers, arms wrapped about his head.

tBlade stops shooting. He leans down towards Tanaka, placing the end
tof his rifle against the man's forehead. Tanaka looks like he's about
tto wet his pants.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI've got a message for your masters -- 
ttthe night's no longer safe for their 
ttkind.

tBlade pulls back his rifle, leaving a red indentation mark where the
tend of the rifle barrel pressed into Tanaka's skin. He starts towards
tthe exit. Karen follows.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade and Karen return to the Olds. He keys the ignition, lets the
tengine idle. They're parked down the street from the blood clinic.
tKaren looks to Blade, confused --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou let him go -- 
ttt(off Blade's nod)
ttAn hour ago you were ready to kill a 
ttman for less, this one didn't even 
tttalk.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttHe will.

tBlade points --

<b>tTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --
</b>
tTanaka rushes from the clinic, climbing behind the wheel of a Mustang
tparked nearby. He takes off -- 

tBlade follows the Mustang, CLICKING on a cell-phone scanner mounted
ton the dash. Numbers flash on the LCD screen as it searches for a
tsignal, then locks onto it. We hear a DIAL TONE, then a number being
tdialed --

<b>ttttAUTOMATED VOICE
</b>ttt(filtered, on scanner)
tt"You've reached a number that is no

ttIt's Tanaka, PIN number

tA "real" voice comes on the line:

</b>ttt(filtered, on scanner)
ttYes?

tKaren looks to Blade, impressed. 

<b>tINT. TANAKA'S MUSTANG - NIGHT
</b>
tTanaka speeds, shouting into the speaker phone -- 

<b>ttttTANAKA
</b>ttGet me Pearl! 

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttt(filtered, on speaker)
ttPearl is feeding --

<b>ttttTANAKA
</b>ttLook, I'm not fucking around here! 
ttThat hunter Frost has been talking 
ttabout? He was just at the clinic. Tore 
ttthe goddamn place apart!

<b>tEXT. THE BLACK PEARL - NIGHT
</b>
tTokyo town. A black edifice, no windows, secured parking, no signage
texcept for a purple neon scroll above the entrance -- a FLASHING
tKANJI, just like the glyph tattooed on Tanaka's neck.

tTanaka's Mustang pulls into the parking lot. He climbs out, flagging
taway the valets, heads inside --

<b>tWHIP PAN TO
</b>
tBlade's Olds stopping a few blocks down the street.

<b>tINT. BLADE'S OLDS - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade kills the engine, studying The Black Pearl.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttLooks like we hit pay-dirt. This place 
ttis crawling with them.
ttt(pointing)
ttSee the valets over there? They're 
ttvampires. So is the doorman.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttHow can you tell?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttThe way they move, they way they

tBlade continues to scan the area, pointing out a few more likely
tcandidates --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttThe whore on the corner, she's one 
tttoo. So are the two men standing under 
ttthe streetlight.

tBlade reaches into the back seat, retrieves his sword and a satchel.
tHe snaps open his shotgun, loads it. Karen continues to study the
tvampires Blade identified.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttSo many of them -- I still can't 
ttbelieve they're real.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttThere are worse things than vampires

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(pumping his shotgun)
ttLike me.

tBlade reaches for the door --

<b>tEXT. THE BLACK PEARL - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade and Karen climb out. He lets his shotgun fall within the folds
tof his longcoat and starts across the street -- only to be challenged
tby a HULKING DOORMAN at the entrance.

<b>ttttDOORMAN
</b>ttI'm sorry, sir -- do you have an 
ttinvitation?

<b>tINT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT
</b>
tCRASH! The front door flies open as the Doorman's body sails through.
tBlade enters, Karen at his heels -- 

tThe 'Pearl' is an all-hours strip club cum casino catering
texclusively to Japanese zaibatsu clientele. Dimly lit, the air thick
twith cigarette smoke, deafening MUSIC. Go boards, pachinko machines,
tsexy little MANGA WAIFS in schoolgirl outfits doling out drinks --

tSTRIPPERS writhe in the circular "pit" tables surrounded by HOWLING
tgrab-ass men. But that's nothing compared to --

tThe MAIN ATTRACTION,

twho's doing a bump and grind down the runway, shaking a body worthy
tof a schoolboy's wet dream. Her attire? A leather S&M face mask,
tnipple rings, 6-inch spikes, and a pair of panties to hide her
tmodesty.

tBlade scans the room -- just in time to see Tanaka ducking into a
tback hallway. Blade pushes towards the rear of the club. Karen
tfollows. 

<b>tON THE STRIPPER
</b>
tas she catches sight of Blade and freezes in mid-routine. The
tstripper pulls off her hood. Long black hair with a streak of white
ttumbles down her back -- it's Mercury. 

<b>tINT. BLACK PEARL, HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade and Karen head past the bathrooms. At the end of the hall is a
tdoor marked "OFFICE". Just then, the Men's door opens, a DRUNK
tCOLLEGE KID steps out, SEES Blade --

<b>ttttKID
</b>ttHey --

tBlade plants a hand over the kid's face, shoving him back into the
tbathroom as he kicks open the office door --

<b>tINT. THE BLACK PEARL, BACK OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tTanaka spins around, startled, tries to throw a punch -- 

tBlade traps Tanaka's arm, levering the man up and over. He CRASHES
tinto a shelving unit, taking the whole thing down with him. Karen
twinces. Blade grabs a handful of Tanaka's hair, yanks his head up --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWhere's the entrance?!

<b>ttttTANAKA
</b>ttI can't -- they'll kill me!

tBlade rips off his glasses and gives Tanaka an eyeful -- his irises
tpulse and glow. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI got news for you, butt-boy. You're 
ttalready dead. 

<b>ttttTANAKA
</b>ttt(terrified)
ttOh God, shit -- behind the bookcase --

tBlade drops Tanaka, moves to the bookcase. He searches the wall a
tmoment, then finds a trigger. Hits it -- the bookcase slides aside,
trevealing a hidden elevator. As Blade moves to put his sunglasses
tback on --

<b>tBLADE'S POV (IN THE REFLECTION OF HIS SUNGLASSES)
</b>
tWe see Tanaka behind him, pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer,
tswinging it up --

tBlade unholsters one of his Casulls faster than any gunslinger in
thistory. He FIRES over his own shoulder, BLOWING Tanaka back against
tthe wall. 

tBlade puts his sunglasses back on, motions to the elevator, then nods
tto Karen --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttAfter you. 

<b>tINT. THE BLACK PEARL, ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
tThe elevator descends. Then a tone CHIMES, signaling the end of the
tride. The doors hiss open -- 

<b>tINT. THE VAMPIRE ARCHIVES, HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade and Karen enter the narrow, maze-like "stacks" of the vampire
tarchives, weaving their way through shelves of climate-controlled,
tdigitized records. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat is this place?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttSome kind of archive --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttIsn't this all a little high-tech? I 
ttthought vampires were more into 
ttcobwebs and coffins.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou've been watching too much TV. 
ttThey've got their claws sunk into 
tteverything -- finance, real estate, 
ttpolitics. Probably own half of 
ttDowntown. 

tBlade pulls a CD-ROM from the shelves, its spine labeled in
tindecipherable vampire glyphs.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttThis must be where they keep their 
ttrecords --

tHe pauses, hearing a DISTANT WHISPER. Blade signals quiet, silently
tleading Karen through the stacks towards -- 

<b>tPEARL'S LAIR
</b>
tA vestibule of sorts, leading to a larger bed chamber constructed of
trice paper shoji screens and tatami mats. Candles glow within,
tilluminating a MONSTROUSLY OBESE SHADOW beyond the translucent rice
tpaper walls.

tThe shadow speaks in a tremulous, bird-like voice -- the secret
ttongue. As Blade draws his sword, the massive shadow freezes --

<b>ttttPEARL'S VOICE
</b>ttt(frightened)
ttLorca, is that you?

tBlade slides open the nearest shoji screen --

<b>tINT. PEARL'S BED CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tNothing Karen's seen up until this point could prepare her for the
tarchive's curator --

<b>tPEARL,
</b>
ta nine-hundred-pound androgynous vampire of Asian origin, lounging
tamidst pillowed rice mats, wearing a communications headset. Think of
ta cross between Divine and Jabba The Hutt. Skin the complexion of
tbuttermilk, so corpulent he can barely move, so engorged with blood
tthat he's actually sweating it from the pores of his skin. 

tPearl is surrounded by a nest of monitors and keyboards which have
tbeen affixed to counter-balanced arms -- this way, Pearl can access
tinformation without leaving bed.

tLying next to Pearl, dwarfed by the vampire's massive size, is the
tchalk-white body of a recently-drained NAKED BOY. 

tAt the sight of Blade, Pearl's eyes widen in fear --

<b>ttttPEARL
</b>ttt(into a speakerphone)
ttHe's here!

<b>ttttFROST'S VOICE
</b>ttt(over speakerphone)
ttCongratulations, Day-Walker.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttFrost?

<b>tINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT
</b>
tFrost paces the length of his pool, wearing a hands-free
tcommunications headset, grinning.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttIn the flesh, Blade. I understand 
ttyou've been looking for me. I'm 
ttflattered.

<b>tINT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tAs Blade listens, Pearl reaches for his trackball, attempting to
tdelete the document currently on his monitors -- but Blade lunges
tforward, sinking the tip of his sword into Pearl's fleshy throat.
tPearl freezes. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(eyeballing Pearl)
ttDon't be. You're another notch on my 
ttsword hilt, nothing else.

tFrost's DEEP LAUGHTER drifts from the speakerphone.

<b>tINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, POOL - NIGHT
</b>
tFrost settles into his chair, enjoying the cat and mouse.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttYou're quick, Blade, I'll give you 
ttthat. In the space of an hour you've 
ttcrossed my familiar, destroyed a blood 
ttbank --

ttNow here you are in the heart of our

<b>ttttPEARL'S VOICE
</b>ttHe has a knife to my throat, Frost! 
ttHe --

ttYou're history, Pearl. Have the good

ttt(beat)
ttRound one to you, Blade.

<b>tINT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tCLICK, the line goes dead. Blade tosses his satchel on the bed, opens
tit. Inside is a hand-held UV lamp hooked up to a nine-volt battery.
tPearl eyes the device, fearful -- 

<b>ttttPEARL
</b>ttWhat is that?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttA sun lamp. We're gonna play twenty 
ttquestions. Depending on your answers, 
ttyou might get to have yourself a

tBlade looks to Pearl's monitor and SEES a digitized image, the SAME
tMANUSCRIPT Deacon had been studying earlier. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWhat were you in such a big hurry to 
ttdelete just now?

tPearl hesitates. Blade turns on the lamp. Pearl HOWLS as the harsh
tlight falls upon him. Blade flicks the light off.

tPearl cringes, GROWLING, his face smoking profusely. Exposure to the
tUV rays, even for one short second, has made his face blister like a
tplague victim's.

<b>ttttPEARL
</b>ttt(relenting)
ttIt's an epistle, a letter Frost has 
ttbeen translating -- it prophesizes 
ttLaMagra's return.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttAnd who is LaMagra?

tPearl hesitates again -- Blade turns on the lamp for a longer time.
tPearl thrashes, covering his face. His hands blacken, the skin
tsizzling away to expose the finger bones beneath. Karen has to avert
ther gaze --

tBlade turns off the lamp. Pearl SNARLS, his body quivering with
tpoisonous rage.

<b>ttttPEARL
</b>ttLaMagra is The Sleeper!!! 

tBlade leans in close so he's eye to eye with Pearl.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWhere's the original, Pearl? You must 
tthave it around here somewhere.

tPearl sweats blood, his flaking, slug-like lips quivering. 

<b>ttttPEARL
</b>ttThe vault --

tBlade follows Pearl's eyes to an armored door, then he stands back,
thanding the UV rig to Karen.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttIf he moves, cook him.

tBlade approaches the vault door, sizing up its locking mechanism. He
tpulls an explosive charge from his combat belt and secures it to the
tdoor, arming it with a BEEP!

<b>ttttPEARL
</b>ttPlease, I'll give you the combination 
tt-- you'll damage the documents --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttThat's the point.

tEnraged, Pearl LUNGES from his bed. Karen triggers the UV rig, flash-
tfrying him to a blackened crisp. Pearl quivers, his enormous body
tsmoking like a piece of charred meat. 

tBlade looks back at Karen with newfound respect. She shrugs.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttHe moved.

tBlade turns back to the vault, setting off the charge. BOOM! Blade
tkicks the damaged door in, knocking it clear off its hinges --

<b>tINSIDE THE VAULT,
</b>
tancient papers flutter through the smoky air like wind-borne leaves.
tBlade and Karen SEE a lucite-encased document -- fragments of an
tancient, calligraphied papyrus. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat are these?

ttttQUINN (o.s.)
ttCuriosity killed the cat.

tBlade and Karen spin --

<b>t-- QUINN,
</b>
tMercury, and a number of other vampires stand at the entrance to the
tvault.

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttt(grins)
ttHola, amigo. Remember me?

tKaren triggers the UV light, but Mercury ducks under it, ripping it
tfrom her hands, crushing it. In a split-second, the she-demon has her
tclaws around Karen's throat.

tAs Blade reaches for his rifle, the vampires converge on him like
tquicksilver. They drag Karen and Blade out --

<b>tPEARL'S BEDCHAMBER
</b>
tThe vampires fling Blade against the wall, pinning him. 

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttYou took my arm, Blade. But that's 
ttokay, I'm growing a new one --

tQuinn lifts up his "arm". A skeletal forearm has grown from the
tstump. It's got cartilage, sinew, and muscle, but no flesh yet. 

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttNice, huh? Think I'll ever play the 
ttpiano again?
ttt(shrugging)
ttYou can slice him, you can dice him, 
ttand the man just keeps on coming. 

tBlade struggles violently, but Quinn is upon him, pounding his fist
tinto Blade again and again and again -- giving him payback with
tcompounded interest. When it's over, Quinn steps back, winded -- 

tBlade's head hangs down. He gasps, wincing, every breath sending a
tred hot poker to his gut. Quinn grabs a hold of Blade's jaw, forcing
this head up. 

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttStay with me, sweetness, I'm not 
ttthrough with you yet.

tQuinn pulls Blade's jacket open, sees the bandoleer of mahogany
tstakes. He tugs one out, admiring it.

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttTeak. Nice craftsmanship. 
ttt(to the others)
ttNow here's a man who takes his job 
ttjust a little too seriously, don't you 
ttthink?
ttt(back to Blade)
ttWhich reminds me, Blade, think I owe 
ttyou one --

tQuinn stabs the stake into Blade's shoulder. Blade CRIES OUT, tries
tto pull free. Karen, who's being held by Mercury, averts her gaze.

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttActually, if you want to get 
tttechnical, I owe you two.

tAs Quinn reaches for another stake, Blade starts to laugh.

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttWhat's so funny, bright eyes?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI'm expecting some company.

tIt's then that Quinn notices the micro ear-coil radio receiver in
tBlade's ear. As we MOVE IN on it, we hear a tiny VOICE squawking from
tit:

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttt(filtered)
ttGet down!

tBlade kicks his feet out, sending Quinn flying backwards. He tears
tfree of the vamps holding him and DIVES forward, knocking Karen to
tthe ground just as --

tBOOM!!! The wall of Pearl's bedchamber EXPLODES INWARD, knocking
tQuinn and the rest of his cronies to their feet. 

<b>tWHISTLER
</b>
tstands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be, brandishing his
tcane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other. He balances the
trifle against his hip like an over-the-hill gunslinger and OPENS FIRE
ton the vampires.

tBlade rolls, snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown
tfree from the vault. Seconds later, he and Karen are fleeing after
tWhistler, retreating back through his newly created exit.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
</b>
tThe three of them find themselves ankle-deep in a flooded sewer
ttunnel running parallel to the archives. Whistler pauses, wheezing
tfrom overexertion. 

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttChrist, I'm too old for this. Somebody 
ttget me a goddamn wheelchair.

tBlade leans against the tunnel wall, GRUNTING as he yanks the stake
tfrom his shoulder. He then pulls out a light-stick, snapping it,
tilluminating the area in a GREEN GLOW -- disturbing waves of
<b>tGLITTERING COCKROACHES. 
</b>
tMeanwhile, Whistler pulls another explosive device from his backpack
tand sets it against the tunnel wall, arming it.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttHow did you find us?!

tWhistler taps a tiny radio headset curled around his ear.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttWe keep in radio contact. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(incredulous)
ttYou've been listening in the whole 
tttime?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttYou think I'd let him run loose 
ttwithout a chaperone? Blade ferrets 
tttheir rat-holes out, I map them. Then 
ttwe blow them all to kingdom come.

tWhistler finishes arming the explosive device. It BEEPS. He turns
tback to Blade and Karen, referring to a handheld navigation device.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttThere's a subway line due East of 
tthere. We'd best make tracks. 

<b>tINT. PEARL'S BEDCHAMBER, ARCHIVES - NIGHT
</b>
tAn EXPLOSION rips through the bedchamber, mushrooming outward --

<b>tINT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT
</b>
tThe EXPLOSION continues expanding, sending tables, drinks, and
tzaibatsu clientele flying.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
</b>
tAs the group splashes through the water, a FIREBALL chases them down
tthe tunnel. They duck into an alcove, narrowly avoiding the flames.
tWhistler WHOOPS with excitement, loving every minute of it. But his
ttriumph is short-lived, for now we hear --

t-- a deafening chorus of HIGH-PITCHED VAMPIRE WAR CRIES coming from
tbehind. Karen hazards a look back --

<b>tTHE VAMPIRES
</b>
tsurge down the tunnel like a pack of hungry wolves on high-octane.
tThere must be a dozen of them now and Quinn is right in the lead.

tOur trio hustles along, but Whistler stumbles, tumbling and sliding
tdown a washout. The steep incline of the washout makes it virtually
timpossible for Whistler to climb back up to the main tunnel.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhistler!

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttGo on, I'll be fine!

tKaren hesitates, but Blade yanks her down the tunnel --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttHe can take care of himself! GO!!!

tThey race through the twisting warren of tunnels, taking one turn
tafter another, the vampires hot on their heels --

<b>tINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade and Karen stumble out into a larger subway tunnel, which widens
tinto a station stop up ahead. We can see the RED TAIL-LIGHTS of a
ttrain just pulling away from the platform -- Blade and Karen re-
tdouble their efforts, lungs burning, legs pumping like mad. Just as
tthe train enters the next tunnel --

t-- they leap, dragging themselves up onto the back of the rear-
tpassenger car. Blade SMASHES his fist through the emergency exit
twindow, then lifts Karen up, helping her climb through into the
tcar -- 

t-- but the vampires are still coming! Crawling along the tunnel walls
ton all fours, limbs a blur, claws striking the concrete and spewing
tout sparks. Closing fast. Too fast. 

<b>tQUINN
</b>
tsprings forward, snagging Blade's ankle with his "good" hand. The
tvampire's weight threatens to haul Blade down. Blade reaches to his
tback-scabbard, unsheathes his sword --

tTHUNK! Blade brings the sword down on Quinn's good arm, cutting it
toff at the wrist! Quinn falls to the tracks, tumbling head over heels
tback into the darkness --

<b>tTHE AMPUTATED HAND,
</b>
twhich continues to clutch at Blade's ankle, starts to melt. With a
tcry of disgust, Blade kicks the thing away. He turns and climbs
tthrough the window --

<b>tINT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 
</b>
tKaren helps Blade inside. He sinks to the floor of the otherwise
tdeserted car, exhausted. He's looking ashen now. The whites of his
teyes are shot through with red.

tKaren gets a good look at Blade's wounds -- the front of his jacket
tis soaked in blood. She reaches for him --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou're hurt --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttNothing that won't heal by dawn.

tBlade reaches into his jacket and pulls out the small, gas-powered
tpistol-injector we saw Whistler inject him with earlier. He tries to
tload one of the ampoules into it, but because of his wounds, he's not
thaving much luck -- 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(frustrated)
ttI need help with this --

tKaren nods, inserting the ampoule into the gun. Blade shrugs off his
tjacket, holds out his arm. Karen pauses --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat am I injecting you with?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(weakly)
ttSerum -- it's a human hemoglobin 
ttsubstitute.

tKaren locates a vein, presses the injector against it -- Blade
ttenses, grits his teeth, fights to keep his body thrashing as the
tserum enters his bloodstream. He grips the wall behind him --
tactually digs his nails into the metal surface -- the agony he's
tgoing through is excruciating, like nothing we could imagine. 

tWhen it's over, he slumps forward, spent, vulnerable, flushed with
tsweat. Karen stares at him --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou're one of them, aren't you?

tBlade turns away from Karen, filled with self-loathing. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttNot quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human, 
tthalf-vampire.

tOff Karen's surprised reaction, we --

tThe loading elevator CLANGS to a stop. Blade throws the gate open.
tKaren helps him out. Now that they're safely back, the last of
tBlade's strength seems to dissipate. 

<b>tWHISTLER
</b>
tis waiting for them, sitting at a workbench. 

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttWhat took you so long?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttDon't even start, old man.

tBlade throws his sword aside, then moves off into the shadows,
tdisappearing beyond the curtains. Karen looks to Whistler --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhy didn't you tell me the truth 
ttabout him?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttWe weren't sure we could trust you.

tWhistler sighs, removing his glasses.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttBlade's mother was attacked by a 
ttvampire while she was pregnant. 
ttUltimately, she died, but her unborn 
ttchild lived. Unfortunately, he'd 
ttundergone certain genetic changes 
ttwhile in the womb --

tWhistler reaches for a pack of cigarettes, pulls one out. He thumbs a
tmatch, fires up. Takes a long drag --

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttI found Blade when he was thirteen. 
ttHe'd been living on the streets, 
ttfeeding off the homeless. Apparently 
ttthe Thirst manifested itself at 
ttpuberty --

ttI took him for one of them at first, 
ttalmost killed him, too. But then I 
ttrealized what he was.

tFrost stands at the window, looking out at the glimmering cityscape
tbefore him.

<b>tINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tFrost turns away from window. Quinn, Mercury, and the other vampires
tfrom the Black Pearl stand before him. Quinn cradles his amputated
tstump with his newly grown arm. 

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttHe took my fucking hand! Again!

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttYou seem to be in the habit of losing

tThe other vampires laugh. Quinn stares them into silence.

</b>ttWe need to find him, tonight.

tFrost claps a hand on Quinn's shoulder.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttDown, boy. Blade's not going anywhere.

ttmore pressing business --
ttt(off Mercury's look)
ttIt's time Dragonetti paid the piper. 

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
</b>
tWhistler studies Karen, exhaling another lungful of smoke.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttBlade's unique, you know. A one in a 
ttbillion anomaly. He can withstand 
ttsunlight, garlic, even silver. But he 
ttstill has the Thirst. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat happens if he doesn't take the 
ttserum?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttThe Thirst overcomes him, just like 
ttthe others. It's not something he can 
ttcontrol. 
ttt(sighs)
ttThe problem is, time's running out. 
ttHis body's starting to reject the 
ttserum. And so far, all my efforts to 
ttfind a cure have ended in failure --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttNo offense, Whistler, but you're not 
ttexactly working with state of the art 
ttequipment here. You might have missed 
ttsomething.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttt(pointedly)
ttWhich is why you're here. We could use 
ttsomeone with your experience.

tA beat passes between them and Karen knows where she stands now. In
tfor a penny, in for a pound. Whistler reaches for Blade's sword.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttThis used to be mine, you know. It's 
ttbeen passed down through the 
ttcenturies, from one hunter to the 
ttnext --

tWhistler extends the sword, sighting down the length of it. He takes
ta few practice parries -- it's obvious he used to be quite skilled in
tthe art of swordsmanship.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhy do you hunt them?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttHabit, mostly, just like this. 

tWhistler gestures with his cigarette. He finally stubs it out, his
twistful reverie vanishing like so much smoke.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttI had a family once -- a wife, three 
ttdaughters. Then a drifter named Deacon 
ttFrost came calling one evening --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttHe killed them?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttEventually. He toyed with them first. 
ttHe made me choose, do you understand? 
ttWhich order they would die in --

tKaren stares at Whistler, horrified.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttHow did you escape?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttI didn't. He was cruel enough to let 
ttme live.
ttt(slapping his brace)
ttEven gave me a souvenir to remember 
tthim by.

tKaren nods -- it's all falling into place for her now.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttAnd now you're using Blade to exact 
ttyour revenge?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttt(pointedly)
ttFrost's bodycount keeps rising, and 
ttI'm not getting any younger, am I?

tJust then, we hear a SCREAM come from Blade's room, sounding more
tlike the cry of a beast than a man. Karen takes a step towards
tBlade's room --

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttI wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
ttIt's best to leave him alone when he's 
ttlike this.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttI'll take my chances.

<b>tINT. BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tKaren enters. It's dark, just a trace of moonlight.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttBlade?

tNo answer. Then Karen SEES him -- crouched in the corner of the room
tlike some kind of nocturnal animal.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttIt's dark in here.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou get used to the darkness.

tKaren takes a step towards him.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhistler told me about your mother. 

tBlade clutches the silver locket in his hand. It swings back and
tforth, like a pendulum.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI can't close my eyes without hearing 
tther scream.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttThose aren't real memories. No one has 
ttthat kind of recall.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI do. I remember from day one. People 
ttstaring at me, sensing I was 
ttdifferent. Watching the fear grow in 
tttheir eyes, knowing in their hearts I 
ttwasn't human.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttIf you're not human, then why do you 
ttbleed like us? 
ttI've seen vampire blood, you don't 
tthave it running through your veins.

tBlade looks at Karen, his lambent eyes glowing in the moonlight.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttJust get out of here.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttBlade --

tBlade turns, his eyes glowing with preternatural fury. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI said, GET OUT!!!

tKaren backs away, startled by Blade's vehemence. She exits, leaving
thim alone with his demons. He holds up one of his empty serum
tampoules, crushing it in his fist.

</b>ttRise and shine, little wing.

<b>tEXT. THE BURNING GROUNDS - JUST BEFORE DAWN
</b>
tFADE IN on Dragonetti, his face covered with a black condemned man's
thood --

tFrost stands before him, grinning like the Cheshire Cat. He's dressed
tfrom head to toe in a black motorcycle suit -- boots, gloves, a
tvisored helmet tucked under one arm. Mercury and Quinn are standing
tnearby, similarly attired. 

tWe're on a stretch of rocky coastline, tucked away in a secluded
tcove. Dragonetti has been stripped bare, chained like Prometheus to
tan ancient standing stone. 

<b>ttttDRAGONETTI
</b>ttt(straining)
ttWhat is this? Where am I?!

tFrost steps forward, pulling Dragonetti's hood off. Dragonetti stares
tat his surroundings, horrified.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWhen was the last time you stopped to 
ttappreciate a sunrise, Dragonetti? 
ttThree, four hundred years? 

tFrost checks his watch, then looks to the ocean. On the horizon, a
tsliver of gold appears. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttHow do you like that? Right on time.

<b>ttttDRAGONETTI
</b>ttt(snarling)
ttThe other elders will never let you 
ttget away with this!

tJust then, the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS emerge behind Frost, forming a
tcircle around Dragonetti. All wear business suits, gloves, along with
thigh-tech "sun masks" to protect their faces from the light's lethal
trays. 

tThey stare at Dragonetti like a silent jury. His face darkens, anger
trising -- but there's a desperation in his eyes now too. He speaks in
tthe secret tongue:

<b>ttttDRAGONETTI
</b>ttt(subtitled)
ttDon't you see, you fools?! He'll 
ttbetray you too! He's planning on 
ttinvoking LaMagra himself!

tThe vampires just smile and shake their heads.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttThe wheel turns, old fang. Guess you 
ttjust got a little too long in the 
tttooth.

tDragonetti's cries are cut short as Frost forces the aging vampire's
tmouth open, ripping out his fangs with his bare hands. Dragonetti
tGURGLES and SHRIEKS, sounding like a dying animal.

tFrost turns to face the Twelve now, his eyes bright with victory. He
tpulls on his motorcycle helmet, as do Mercury and Quinn. 

tBehind them, Dragonetti struggles furiously against his chains to no
tavail as the first faint rays of daylight fall upon him, channeled
tinward by the natural formation of the cove -- 

tDragonetti HOWLS, his skin beginning sizzle and smoke. Then he
tcatches fire like paper beneath a magnifying glass. He thrashes about
tas his flesh starts to run from his body.

<b>tTHE VAMPIRE ELDERS
</b>
twatch, impassive, protected by their masks --

t-- when suddenly, TWELVE FIGURES rise up behind them, clad in bike
thelmets and black leather, just like Frost. The intruders grip each
tof the Elders in a strangle hold, ripping their masks off. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttDragonetti was right. You were fools 
ttto trust me.

tFrost flips down the visor of his helmet even as --

<b>tTHE RED SUN
</b>
trises in all its fiery glory.

tOne by one, the vampire Elder's heads catch fire, skullflesh sizzling
taway -- burning down the line of them in successively building
tintensity until all twelve EXPLODE in a conflagration of BLINDING
<b>tWHITE LIGHT.
</b>
tFrost and his compatriots are blown off their feet by the sheer
tintensity of the occult blast -- a blast which sends the skeletal
tbodies of the Elders SLAMMING into the rock wall.

tWhen it's over, Frost picks himself back up. We SEE that the only
tthing left of Dragonetti and the others are --

<b>tTHIRTEEN SHADOW SILHOUETTES
</b>
tpermanently etched onto the rock's surface, just like the bombing
tvictims of Hiroshima.

tKaren stands at a lab table with Whistler, preparing a number of
tblood sample vials. They are surrounded by host of new medical
tequipment -- from centrifuges to genetic sequencers and beyond.

tBlade emerges from his room, looks to Karen. As if by silent
tagreement, last night's words go unacknowledged. He straps on his
tbandoleer of stakes, secures his scabbard.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttGoing somewhere?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttChina Town. I need more serum.
ttt(re: new equipment)
ttWhat's all this?

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttI made a trip to the hospital last 
ttnight, borrowed some equipment.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(sarcastic)
ttFor your miracle cure? 

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttShe's been making real progress, 
ttBlade.
ttt(to Karen)
ttShow him --

tKaren looks to Blade, who shrugs. She opens a refrigerator, removing
ta syringe filled with blue fluid.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttThis is sodium citrate. It's an 
ttanti-coagulant. We use it to treat 
ttblood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood 
ttis thinner than humans, though. Watch 
ttwhat happens when I introduce some 
ttinto a sample --

tKaren gestures to the microscope. Blade takes a look --

<b>tBLADE'S POV
</b>
tVampire blood cells swirling about.

tKaren injects the contents of the syringe onto the slide of cells --
tthe reaction is immediate. The vampire blood turns black, then begins
tviolently bubbling.

tBlade lifts his head away from the microscope just in time -- the
tblood on the slide atomizes, exploding outward in a fine mist which
tbursts apart the glass lens of the scope. 

tWhistler laughs, thrilled with the results.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttCan you imagine what a dash of that 
ttwould do on your sword? 

tWhistler claps his hand on Karen's shoulder in approval, then limps
taway, quickly busying himself with another project. Blade moves to
tfollow, but Karen stops him --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttBefore you go, I'd like to take a 
ttsample of your blood.

tBlade grudgingly rolls up his sleeve. As Karen takes her sample,
tBlade looks to Whistler. The older man brings a handkerchief to his
tlips, coughing into it. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttIs he sick?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttCancer.

tKaren watches as Blade's blood flows into the vacutainer. She fills
tthe first, then inserts another. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou care about him, don't you? 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWe've got a good arrangement, that's 
ttall. Whistler makes the weapons, I use 
ttthem, the vampires die -- end of 
ttstory.

tKaren finishes. Blade rolls up his sleeve.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(pointedly)
ttMy mother used to say that a cold 
ttheart is a dead heart.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYour mother sounds like a Hallmark 
ttgreeting card. 

tBlade slips his Casulls into a shoulder holster, then shrugs into his
tleather jacket, donning his sunglasses.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI'd wish you luck, Doc, but I never 
ttput much stock in optimism.

tHe heads towards the elevator.

<b>tEXT. CHINATOWN, STREETS - DAY

tBlade makes his way down a street lined with vending stalls --
tpassing MERCHANTS peddling exotic vegetables and cheap curios,
tbutcher shops with rows of roast ducks in the window, tyro GANG-
tBANGERS lounging at the entrance to a video arcade.

<b>tBLADE'S POV
</b>
tEven though the streets are crowded, the people seem to make way for

tBlade turns into a dark alley, ducking into the doorway of a hole-in-

tA bell atop the door JINGLES, announcing Blade's arrival. We're in a

tfeaturing things like "Toad Spleen Extract" and "Barking Deer Wine".
tJoss sticks burn, sending wispy tendrils of incense into the air. 

tAt the back of the shop, an elderly CHINESE MAN in a cardigan sits in
tfront of a battered television, watching a boxing match. He's eating
ta bowl of litchi fruit. On the counter nearby, a SPIDER MONKEY
twatches attentively.

</b>ttHow's it going, Kam?

<b>ttttKAM
</b>ttt(re: calendar)
ttYou're a week early.

tKam sets his fruit bowl aside, leads Blade through a curtain into a
tback room.

<b>tINT. HERBALIST SHOP, BACK ROOM - DAY

tKam hands Blade a leather valise. He opens it -- its lined with tiny
tampoules of scarlet-colored serum. Blade pulls one out, holds it up
tto the light.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWhistler says I'm building up a 
ttresistance to it.

<b>ttttKAM
</b>ttI was afraid that might happen.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttMaybe it's time to start exploring 
ttother alternatives.

<b>ttttKAM
</b>ttThere's only one alternative to the 
ttserum.

tBlade nods. They both know what that "alternative" is. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYeah. I know.

tBlade closes the valise and tucks it inside his jacket. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttThanks, Kam.
ttt(thinking)
ttOne other thing. Have you ever heard 
ttof a vampire called the Sleeper?

tKam shakes his head. Blade pulls out the parchment he took from
tPearl.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI found this in there archives. I need 
ttto find someone who can read their 
ttlanguage. 

tKam studies the parchment.

<b>ttttKAM
</b>ttI've heard about a woman named 
ttMiracia. Some say she's a mayombero, a 
ttSanteria witch. Supposedly she lives 
ttin that tent community down by the

tBlade nods his thanks and heads back through the curtains.

tBlade emerges from the alley into the sunlight, then hears his name
tWHISPERED on the wind.

ttttVOICE (o.s.)
ttBlade.

tBlade spins, scanning his surroundings -- did he really hear his
tname, or was it just the wind?

ttttVOICE (o.s.)
ttBlade.

tAgain, the taunting voice calls him. Blade's gaze finally settles
ton --

<b>tA MAN
</b>
tsitting on a bench in the deep shade, his face obscured by the
tChinese newspaper he's reading. There's a LITTLE GIRL sitting stiffly
tbeside the man -- a look of pure terror written on her face. 

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttAfternoon, Blade.

tThe man lowers his newspaper. It's Deacon Frost. He's wearing
tsunglasses, but otherwise, he's seemingly unprotected by the sun. 

tBlade reaches for his .454 -- 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttEasy.

tFrost's hand rests on the back of the girl's neck. We see his claws
textend, caressing the flesh beneath her chin.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWouldn't want our little friend here 
ttto wind up on the back of a milk 
ttcarton, would we? 

tBlade reluctantly lowers his hand. Frost smiles. He takes in a deep
tbreath of air, savoring it. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttBeautiful day, isn't it? 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(confused)
ttHow can you be out here?

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttI dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical 
ttresearch. We've developed a type of 
ttsun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a 
ttfew others things. 

tOn closer examination we see that Frost is wearing a translucent
tlotion on his face. He touches a finger to his cheek, rubs some of
tthe lotion between his fingers.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttIt's not very effective in direct 
ttsunlight, but it's a start. The goal, 
ttof course, is to be like you, "the

</b>ttI don't buy it.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttMaybe I don't see it that way.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttOh, so it's back to pretending we're

ttwhat you are. You're one of us, Blade. 
ttYou always have been.

</b>ttAm I? You think the humans will ever 
ttaccept a half-breed like you? They 
ttcan't. They're afraid of you. 
ttt(pointedly)
ttThe humans fear us because we're 
ttsuperior. They fear us because in 
tttheir hearts they know their race has 
ttbecome obsolete.

tFrost watches the marketers stream past, sneering in contempt. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttLook at them, just an endless stream 
ttof cattle in a mad race to the 
ttslaughterhouse. 

tFrost lifts a silver flask to his mouth, taking a swig of blood. He
tsmacks his lips, sighs contentedly --

ttt(offering it to Blade)
ttCare for some? Smells good, doesn't

</b>ttPass.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttYou sure now? I bled a newborn for 
ttthis. You won't find a drink that's 
ttsweeter. 

tIt takes every ounce of Blade's self-control to keep from attacking
tFrost -- and Frost senses this, pressing his sharp thumbnail against
tthe child's jugular.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttTell me honestly, do you really get 
ttthe same rush from that pasteurized 
ttpiss-serum of yours?
ttt(off Blade's look)
ttYou're surprised I know about your

tteverything about you. 

tFrost leans forward, grinning.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttYou can't keep walking the razor's

ttsoon, when you'll have to choose 
ttbetween our kind and their's. If I 
ttwere you, I'd take care not to wind up 
tton the wrong end of the fang.

tA bead of sweat runs down Frost's neck, washing away a minute amount
tof the sun-blocking cream. The patch of exposed skin instantly
tblackens. Frost gazes upwards at the sun.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttLove to continue this chat, but it 
ttappears I'm melting.

tFrost rises, taking the little girl by the hand. Blade follows, his
thand resting on the butt of his Casull.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou're not going anywhere.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttt(growling)
ttWatch me.

tFrost's eyes flicker towards the street -- a CITY BUS is rumbling by.
tIn a heartbeat, Frost hurls the little girl forward --

t-- out into the path of the oncoming bus! 

tBlade has a split-second to act. It's Frost or the girl -- and for a
tmoment we actually think he's going to go for Frost --

t-- but then he DIVES forward, scooping the girl into his arms,
tthrowing themselves out of the bus' path. The bus misses them by a
thair. By the time Blade looks up again --

t-- Frost is gone. Blade rises, cursing, scanning the street as
tmarket-goers gather around him.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttAny progress?

</b>ttSome. It's been slow --

</b>ttYou don't look so good.

tBlade nods, not buying her explanation. He shoots a glance to
tWhistler, which doesn't go unnoticed by Karen.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttExcuse me.

tKaren turns, heading for the back of the workshop.

<b>tINT. WORKSHOP - BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tKaren enters a dingy bathroom, turning on the overhead bulb. She
tstudies her reflection in the mirror above the sink, then grimaces as
tshe peels the dressing from her wound -- the wound is clearly
tinfected, gangrenous. 

<b>ttttBLADE (O.S.)
</b>ttIt's started.

tKaren spins, startled. Blade stands behind her. He grips her jaw,
tturning her head so he can better view the wound.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou've got another day or two at most.

tKaren nods, shaken. As she moves to leave, Blade reaches for her arm,
tstopping her.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttFor what it's worth, I'm sorry.

</b>ttYou make it sound like I'm already

tcardboard and plywood squatter's ghetto which has sprung up around
tthe city dump. CHILDREN and DOGS forage for salvageable items, while
tin the distance, dumptrucks grind over the dunes of refuse.

<b>tMOMENTS LATER,
</b>
tBlade is winding his way through the maze of makeshift homes and
tashcan fires. A CROWD quickly closes in around him, suspicious. A
tBRUTISH MAN steps forward, challenging him --

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttExtranjero. xbfQuien es?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me.

tThe man turns to his fellow squatters, WHISPERING. After a heated

<b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttThis way.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
</b>
tWhistler and Karen sit at a work table. Karen is looking at a blood
tsmear slide through a microscope. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttAll right, let's start with the basics 
tt-- why do vampires need to drink 
ttblood?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttTheir own blood can't sustain 
tthemoglobin. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttThen vampirism is a genetic defect, 
ttjust like Hemolytic anemia?

tWhistler nods.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttSo what about gene therapy?

tWhistler looks intrigued. Karen continues.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttBasically you'd have to re-write the 
ttvictim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA 
ttwill produce proteins capable of 
ttgenerating hemoglobin. 

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttHow?

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWith a retrovirus. It's injected into 
ttthe bone marrow cells, it causes the 
tthost's DNA to mutate. They've been 
ttusing them to treat Sickle-cell 
ttanemia. 

tWhistler can hardly believe what he's hearing.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttYou're serious? You actually think 
ttthis could work?

tKaren pauses -- we can see in her expression that there's something
tshe's been holding back.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttOn me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so 
ttsure -- 
ttt(gravely)
ttThe problem is, Blade didn't contract 
ttthe vampire virus from a bite like I 
ttdid. He was born with it. The irony 
ttis, I could probably cure every 
ttvampire but him.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttThen we're back to square one, aren't 
ttwe? Sooner or later, the Thirst always 
ttwins.

tAt that moment, the lights in the workshop flicker, then go out.
tKaren looks around the room, alarmed. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat happened to the power?

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttt(concerned)
ttI don't know, but the back-up 
ttgenerator should've kicked in.

tA few seconds pass. The back-up generator still hasn't activated.
tWhistler moves to the window --

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttUV floodlights are down too.

tAs Whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of GLASS
tSHATTERING coming from the other end of the workshop. Whistler shines
tthe flashlight in that direction. We hear more sounds now -- water
tdraining, glass tinkling.

tWhistler raises a finger to his lips, signaling silence. He edges
ttowards the black-out curtains, Karen falling in behind him.

<b>tINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - TANK ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tWhistler and Karen enter, cautious --

<b>tTHE TANK
</b>
tcontaining the vampire child has been smashed open. It's empty now,
twith just the steadily draining blood seeping across the floor in a
twidening pool -- and a trail of tiny BLOODY FOOTPRINTS leading back
tout into the main workshop.

<b>tINT. WHISTLER'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
</b>
tKaren scans the shadows, eyes alert. We hear a WHISPER, then a
tteasing, childish, GIGGLE.

tWhistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle, shining the beam over
tevery inch of the room. And just as he's about to complete his
tcircuit --

<b>tTHE CHILD
</b>
tleaps from where it had been hiding overhead! Karen SCREAMS.
tWhistler is knocked to the floor, the flashlight spinning from his
thand --

tThe feral child lands atop Whistler, HISSING like a cobra. Its
tmacrocephalic head seems to morph, twisting into grotesque
tproportions. And just as it's about to strike --

tZZZZING! Whistler withdraws a silver rapier which had been hidden
tinside his cane. He lunges forward --

tWHOOSH! The child takes off like a blue streak, sending test tubes
tand medical equipment CRASHING to the floor. It zips past Karen --

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttGet it!!!

tKaren snatches up the flashlight, chasing after it as Whistler
tstruggles to his feet --

tKaren sweeps the flashlight around, catching only fleeting glimpses
tof the child as it darts through the workshop. She reaches a shelving
tunit where Whistler's weapons are stored, grabs one of the modified
tpistols --

tKaren tries to draw a bead on the creature. She FIRES, misses, FIRES
tagain -- she's getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the
tcreature is moving closer and --

t-- suddenly it's right in front of her, flying through the air, fangs
tbared! 

tThe child knocks Karen back against the wall. It's at her throat,
tsinking its claws into her neck. Karen chokes, forcing Whistler's
tpistol under the monstrosity's chin --

t-- but then the creature morphs again, transforming into a beatific
tlittle cherubim of a child -- and Karen hesitates, because the child
tseems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous, pulsing and
thypnotic and --

t-- suddenly Whistler reaches in from behind, YANKING the vampire
tchild's head back, FIRING a pistol into its skull. The creature
tslumps --

tKaren cries out, disgusted, flinging the corpse away from her. As it
tcontinues to writhe --

tTHUNK! Whistler swings his cane-rapier down on the creature, brutally
tdecapitating it. Finishing the job. Then he looks to Karen, winded.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttUnderstand this -- they are monsters. 
ttHesitate for even a moment, and you've

</b>ttWords to live by, Whistler.

tWhistler spins, eyes wide. He knows that voice.

tgarish pictures of Saints and demons abound, alongside bottles of
troots and herbs steeped in alcohol, human bones, voodoo dolls. 

<b>tMIRACIA 
</b>
tsits on a sagging couch outside, clutching a deck of well-thumbed
tBicycle playing cards. She's ancient, with a mouthful of gold-capped
tteeth and cataract-clouded eyes. Blind.

<b>ttttMIRACIA
</b>ttIs something wrong, my friend?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou're blind --

<b>ttttMIRACIA
</b>ttThere are other ways to see. Sit.

trickety table, setting them in nine piles which take on a cross
tformation. 

<b>ttttMIRACIA
</b>ttPerhaps you have brought me something 
tt-- an offering for the orishas?

tBlade tosses a handful of bills on the table. Miracia nods, then
tflips over the first card in the center pile -- a one-eyed Jack. She
tsighs, grave --

<b>ttttMIRACIA
</b>ttHold out your hands.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI didn't come here to get my palms 
ttread. I need something translated.

<b>ttttMIRACIA

tBlade removes parchment fragment from his jacket and sets it on the
ttable. Miracia traces her fingers over the ancient paper, touching
ther fingertips to her lips.

<b>ttttMIRACIA
</b>ttSangre. Written in blood. 

tShe runs her hands over each line as if it were written in Braille.
tSome of the candles gutter, then extinguish themselves as the wind
taround them rises.

<b>ttttMIRACIA

tMiracia shrugs, spreading her hands.

<b>ttttMIRACIA
</b>ttThe Great Wheel turns, my friend. The

tBlade rises, looking to the horizon. Incredibly, dawn is coming. As
the stands there, mystified, the wind picks up, sweeping the parchment
tfragment out of his hand. He tries to snatch it back, but the
tfragment is quickly borne away. He watches it disappear into the sky,
tthen turns back --

tMiracia is gone. Blade glances around him, but she's nowhere to be
tfound.

tman's lips.

tBlade rushes to the wall, cutting Whistler down with his sword,
tgently lowering him to the floor. As he cradles the old man in his
tarms, Blade sees the primary wound -- two ragged puncture marks along
tWhistler's throat.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttJesus, Whistler, what did they do to

</b>ttWhistler, I can't.

tWhistler clutches at Blade's arm, his eyes burning with conviction.

<b>ttttWHISTLER
</b>ttYes you can. Now get on with it. 

tAs much as he'd like to deny it, Blade knows that Whistler is right.
tHe pulls a stake from his bandoleer, hesitates.

ttI know. 
ttt(forcing a smile)
ttJust be quick about it, will you? Do

tBlade fights back tears. With a wretched moan, he turns his head and
tdrives the stake into Whistler's chest. Whistler GASPS. Blade wraps
this arms around the older man, holding him tight as the life runs out
tof him, rocking back and forth --

tAfter a while, the rocking stops and Blade lays Whistler on the
tfloor. Then something catches his eye --

<b>tA SHARP VIEW-CAMCORDER
</b>
tresting nearby, labeled, "PLAY ME". Blade reaches for the camcorder,
tcues the tape -- Frost's face appears on the tiny built-in screen.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttHello, Blade. By the time you watch 
ttthis, Whistler will no doubt be 
ttwinging his way to Heaven, thanks to 
ttyour capable hands. If it makes any 
ttdifference to you, he put up quite a

tFrost touches a deep gash which runs across his cheek.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttNow, I'm sure you're wondering about

ttt(beat)
ttI'll make this as easy as possible for

ttEdgewood Towers. We'll be waiting with 
ttbaited breath.

tThe tape cuts to static. Blade throws the camcorder against the wall.
tIt shatters into a dozen pieces.

tBlade turns now, his eyes falling on the medical equipment Karen
tbrought from the hospital. He moves to the refrigerator, removing a
tcanister labeled "SODIUM CITRATE". Then he draws his sword. We can
tpractically see the wheels turning within his mind --

<b>tMOMENTS LATER,
</b>
tBlade stands before the open flames of one of the furnaces, heating
this sword in the fire. He withdraws it -- it's molten red.

tBlade turns, dousing the molten hot sword into the sodium citrate
tcanister. The refrigerated liquid reacts with the heat, causing the
tsword to STEAM and HISS.

tWhen Blade withdraws the smoking sword, we SEE that the gleaming
tsteel has changed colors, taking on a bluish tinge, just like the
tsodium citrate it was immersed in. Blade smiles to himself,
tsatisfied.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttA few thousand scattered about the 
ttglobe. In the past, we've had to 
ttrestrict our numbers for fear of 
ttdiscovery. That won't be necessary 
ttafter tonight. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttWhat happens then?

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttThe Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied 
ttholy war against the humans. There's a 
ttforce, you see -- a spirit that exists 
ttin our blood. I've discovered a way to 
ttinvoke it.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttLaMagra --

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttThat's right. The answers were there 
ttall along, of course, scribbled down 
ttin the forgotten languages of my kind. 
ttWaiting for someone with the patience 
ttto decipher them. 
ttMy elders were foolish enough to 
ttdismiss them as wives tales. But I 
ttknew better. 
ttt(beat)
ttImagine my surprise when Blade turned 
ttout to be the key which would set that 
ttforce free. 

tFrost sits forward now, impassioned.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttLaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a 
ttspirit, requiring a flesh and blood 
tthost in order to manifest himself.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWho better to usher in the Blood Tide? 

tKaren shakes her head, protesting --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttThere's no need for any of this. Your 
ttcondition can be treated. Whistler and 
ttI were working on a cure when --

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWhat makes you think we want to be 
ttcured? Blood is only part of the 
ttequation. The hunt, the killing, 
ttthat's what the Thirst is really 
ttabout.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttBut you use blood banks --

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttOnly as a last resort. Preserved blood 
ttis inferior. There's no flavor left to 
ttit, no life. 
ttt(rising from his seat)
ttFortunately, I've found a way around 
ttthat particular obstacle. 

tFrost moves to the end of the room. He pushes a button. With a HUM
tthe wall slides open, revealing something Karen wishes she'd never
tseen -- living blood banks.

<b>tTHREE SEDATED HUMANS
</b>
thave been hooked up to IV feeds which replenish various nutrients as
ttheir blood is drained from them. Shunts have been implanted in their
tforearms which serve as taps. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttUnder these conditions I can keep a 
ttdonor alive for years, producing 
ttanywhere from fifty to a hundred pints 
ttof blood.
ttt(admiring his charges)
ttOf course, this is just a pilot 
ttprogram, really. Once the Tide comes, 
ttwe'll need to expand production. So 
ttmany more mouths to feed -- 

tKaren turns away, overwhelmed by revulsion. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYou're a monster.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWhy? Because we live at another 
ttspecies' expense? Your people farm 
ttcattle and veal, don't they? Fattening 
ttthem up with steroids? It's called 
ttevolution, Doctor. Survival of the 
ttfittest. 

tFrost stares at Karen with an intense, uncompromising gaze. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttI have a wake-up call for the human 
ttrace. You're no longer at the top of 
ttthe food chain.

<b>tEXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP - DAY
</b>
<b>tBLADE'S POV
</b>
tA telephoto view of Frost's penthouse. The windows are polarized,
tblocking out the sun's harsh rays.

tBlade lowers a pair of binoculars. He's standing on the roof of a
tbuilding across the street. He hefts an air-launcher rifle up into
tfiring position --

tBANG! An iron spike trailing a steel cable rockets through the air
tbetween the two buildings, sinking into the concrete facade of
tFrost's penthouse. Blade secures his end of the rope. He slips a
tpulley over the rope, grabs hold of two handles, and leaps off the
troof ledge!

tWHOOSH! Blade slides towards Frost's penthouse, a good twenty stories
tabove street level. A second before he reaches the windows, Blade
tlets go. Momentum sends him CRASHING through in a shower of glass.

<b>tINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
tAn ALARM is ringing. Sunlight streams in through the broken window.
tTWO VAMPIRE GUARDS who have been caught in the sudden swath of light
tare burning up before our eyes. Blade climbs to his feet --

<b>tA THIRD VAMPIRE
</b>
tleaps at him. Blade spins, flipping the vampire over his shoulder,
tsending him straight through one of the other windows --

<b>tEXT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
tThe vampire tumbles earthward, SCREAMING as the sun's rays ignite his
tbody, falling like a human comet.

<b>tINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
tBlade unsheathes his sword and heads out into the hall --

<b>tINT. FROST'S PENTHOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tTo Blade's right is the inner chamber with the "waterfall" walls. As
tANOTHER VAMPIRE approaches, Blade readies his sword --

<b>ttttVAMPIRE
</b>ttYou think I'm afraid of that toothpick 
ttof yours?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou should be. I've made some 
ttimprovements.

tAnd with that, Blade thrusts his blackened sword forward, right
tthrough the vampire's chest. 

tThe creature SHRIEKS and atomizes -FWOOSH!- flying apart in a fine-
tbeaded spray of blood mist. 

tUp ahead are a set of steel doors with a time-lock mechanism. Blade
tdraws a Casull, BLASTS away at the lock, then shoulders the doors
topen --

<b>tINT. FROST'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
tWe are in a windowless, vault-like room dominated by a series of
thigh-tech STAINLESS STEEL SARCOPHAGI. Think of a hyperbaric coffin, 
teach unit possessing a small face-plate window through which the 
tsleeping subject can be viewed.

tBlade unsheathes his sword. He grabs the lid of the first
tsarcophagus, HEAVING upward. With a PNEUMATIC HISS, the lid rises,
tbelching out a cloud of condensation mist. 

tAs the mist clears, revealing the occupant within, Blade raises his
tsword, ready to plunge it downward -- only it's not Deacon Frost who
trests beneath him, it's --

<b>tVANESSA,
</b>
tBlade's mother!!! Although some thirty years have passed since the
tevents of our prologue, Vanessa looks exactly the same -- vibrant,
tbeautiful, full of life. Her eyes open.

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttJason. 

tBlade gasps, uncomprehending.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttMother -- ?!

tVanessa rises from the sarcophagus, tears staining her cheeks.

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttI've missed you so much, Jason. 
ttt(drawing closer)
ttYou have no idea what I've been 
ttthrough, how much I've wanted to see 
ttyou -- 

tBlade falters, his mind reeling. What he's seeing is incomprehensible
t-- his mother is dead. Yet, here she is in the flesh, reaching out to
thim and --

t-- flashing a mouthful of viper-like fangs! She SNARLS and strikes,
tbrutally raking her claws across Blade's face, knocking the sword
tfrom his grasp --

<b>tA TRIO OF BLACK-CLAD VAMPIRES
</b>
tled by Mercury step from the shadows where they'd been waiting all
talong. They're armed with tasers which they fire en masse --

tBlade is hit by the taser darts from all sides. He writhes as
telectricity courses through him, then collapses in a heap. He labors
tto lift his head, looking up at Vanessa -- 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttBut you -- died --

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttt(a hellish smile)
ttDeacon brought me back. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttFight him --

tAs if on cue, Frost appears at Vanessa's side, wrapping a proprietary
tarm about her waist, kissing the nape of her neck. She leans into him
t-- an act of practiced intimacy.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttShe can't. She's one of my thralls 
ttnow. She has about as much free will 
ttas a puppet on a string.
ttt(looking at Vanessa)
ttYou love me, don't you, Vanessa? 

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttYes.

tFrost kisses Vanessa hungrily. Then he kneels and reaches into
tBlade's jacket, retrieving a vial of Blade's serum.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWhat do we have here? Your precious 
ttserum? I don't think you'll be needing 
ttthis anymore.

tFrost crushes the vial in his fist. Blade struggles to reach Frost,
tstretching a palsied hand upwards --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttPlease -- 

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttListen to your father, Jason. It's 
ttgoing to be a better world.

tBlade stares at Vanessa uncomprehending. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttDon't look so surprised, Blade. You've 
ttspent your life looking for the 
ttvampire who fathered you. Well you can 
ttrest easy now, you've found him.
ttt(gripping Blade's chin)
ttDaddy's here.

tBlade's eyes widen in shock. Frost simply laughs.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttIt's true, Blade. You've got my blood 
ttrunning through your veins.
ttt(smiling)
ttThirty years ago. A moonlit street, a 
ttwoman on her way home alone. You were 
ttconceived the night I tore my fangs 
ttinto your mother's flesh. 

tFrost swings his fist into Blade's skull. Everything goes black. 

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT
</b>
tFADE IN as Blade opens his eyes, still groggy, his face beaded with
tsweat. Feverish. His hands have been bound tightly behind his back
twith manacles and chains. 

<b>tKAREN
</b>
tsits nearby, watching him. From the steady rocking motion and the
tSOUNDS of traffic outside, it's evident that they are in the back of
ta moving truck.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttAre you all right?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(weakly)
ttI've been better --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttHow long have we been driving?

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(shaking her head)
ttI don't know. I woke up just before 
ttyou did --

tAs he struggles to sit up, she crosses over to him. Blade shuts his
teyes for a moment, fighting a wave of pain.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttIs it bad?

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(nodding)
ttWe get out of this alive, maybe I'll 
tttake that miracle cure of yours.

tKaren doesn't respond. Instead she looks away. How in the world is
tshe supposed to tell him this?

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(quietly)
ttIt won't work on you.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWhat are you talking about?

tKaren forces herself to meet his gaze.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYour condition's congenital, the 
ttgenetic mutations occurred in utero. 
ttAll the other victims contracted 
ttvampirism after birth. 

tBlade stares at Karen, disbelieving. Who could imagine a more
thorrifying irony? She's crying now. She can't help it.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttI can't cure you, Blade. I can cure 
ttmyself, but I can't cure you.
ttt(beat)
ttI'm so sorry.

tBlade's head sinks, the last vestiges of hope draining out of him.

tAnd then, as if the final stake were being pounded in, the truck
tlurches to a stop. We hear the ENGINE being killed, then FOOTSTEPS
tapproaching, and then a series of BOLTS BEING SHIFTED as --

t-- the back of the truck is thrown open. Frost stands there,
tgrinning, flanked by Mercury, Quinn, Vanessa, and a half-dozen other
<b>tVAMPIRE ASSOCIATES. 
</b>
<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWelcome home, children.

<b>tEXT. THE BANK OF EREBUS - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade and Karen are dragged from the back of the truck, which is
trevealed now to be an armored car. 

<b>tTHE BANK OF EREBUS
</b>
trises up before them. A towering beaux-arts edifice situated in the
theart of the city's high-priced financial district -- one of the many
tinstitutions owned and operated by the vampire enclave.

tFrost starts up the marble steps towards a grand, triple-arched
tentrance flanked by Corinthian columns. Karen and Blade are dragged
talong after him. 

<b>tINT. BANK OF EREBUS - ATRIUM - NIGHT
</b>
tFrost leads his vampires into a high-ceilinged atrium, moving towards
ta bank of elevators -- one of the doors of which is outfitted with a
thigh-tech hand-key ID system.

tFrost places his palm on the ID screen. The screen GLOWS GREEN,
tacknowledging his identity. In response, the doors HISS open.

<b>tINT. SECURITY ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade and Karen are pulled inside the elevator. The control panel
tbuttons have vampire glyphs, rather than numbers. Frost presses the
tbottom one. The doors close with a WHOOSH and the car descends --
tdown, down, down.

tFrost glances over at Karen, smiling amiably.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttOn its surface, this building houses 
ttone of the city's oldest financial 
ttinstitutions -- and for over 
tttwo-hundred years its served our 
ttcorporate needs. Look beneath the 
ttsurface, however, and you'll discover 
ttanother truth entirely --

tThe elevator CHIMES, having arrived at its destination. The doors
tHISS open, revealing 

<b>tINT. THE TEMPLE OF NIGHT 
</b>
tA vast, barrel-vaulted chamber lined with recessed tombs stretches
tout before us -- an underground cathedral of sorts, wrought from
talabaster and marble. Restrained. Elegant. Replete with dark
tsplendor.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttAs above, so below.

tTorches burn in wall sconces, casting everything in a warm, amber
tglow. Frost takes in the beauty of the place.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWelcome to our hall of ancients, 
ttDoctor. We call it the Temple of 
ttNight.

tBlade and Karen are led to the middle of the room, where a stone
taltar rises up from a dais. Blade is roughly thrown to the ground. He
tkneels there, eyes cast downward. Broken. His system being assaulted
tby the devastating effects of the Thirst. 

tQuinn and Mercury pick their way through Blade's discarded gear.
tQuinn picks up the punching dagger, admiring it. 

tFrost turns to Mercury, who's been holding Blade's scabbarded sword.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttLet's see this sword of his.

tMercury draws the sword, handing it to Frost. He sights down the
tlength of it, testing its weight. With a flick of his wrist, he
tlashes out, slashing Blade's cheek open. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttStill quite sharp, I see.

tBlade feebly struggles to rise. Frost clubs him on the back of the
tneck with the sword pommel. Blade crumples. Karen tries to pull free,
tbut Quinn holds her tight.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttBlade --

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttYou're wasting your breath, woman. He 
ttcan't hear you now. It's the Thirst, 
ttyou see? It already has him in its 
ttgrip.

tFrost reaches down, dragging Blade's head up by his hair. Karen
twatches on as Frost continues to taunt him.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttHow long has it been since you had 
ttyour serum? Twelve hours? More? You 
ttmust be quite thirsty by now.

tHe crouches down so he's eye to eye with Blade.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWhat does it feel like? Is your blood 
tton fire? Are you burning up inside? 
ttGive in to the Thirst, Blade. Embrace 
ttyour true nature.

tBlade shivers, grits his teeth, it's like he's going through heroin
twithdrawal. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>tt-- go to hell --

tFrost smiles, his eyes burning with an infernal glow.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttI've got news for you, Blade. We're 
ttalready here.

tFrost turns to the others, motioning.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttTake him to the sanctuary. It's time 
tthe was bled.

tThe other vampires retreat, dragging Blade along with them. Karen is
tleft alone with Frost and Quinn.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttI'd let you watch the proceedings, 
ttDoctor, but I'm afraid that privilege 
ttis reserved for members of my own 
ttrace. Don't worry, though, I've made 
ttalternate arrangements for you.

tFrost motions and Quinn drags Karen towards --

<b>tTHE MOUTH OF A PIT
</b>
tsome forty feet deep, its lichen-encrusted stone walls worn smooth
tover time. As Frost gestures to the yawning darkness beneath them,
tQuinn forces Karen towards the edge. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttWe call this the Bone Pit. It's where 
ttwe keep our mistakes, the ones who 
ttcouldn't successfully make the 
tttransition from human to vampire. 

tFrost reaches out, caressing Karen's neck, puncturing the soft flesh
tbeneath her chin with a razored fingernail.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttThey'll feed on anything, given the 
ttchance -- animals, corpses, even other 
ttvampires.

tFrost nods. Karen struggles against Quinn, but it's no good. In a
tmanner of seconds, she's falling --

<b>tINT. BONE PIT - NIGHT
</b>
t-- making a decidedly rough landing on a heap of bones far below. She
tGROANS, taking stock of her battered body.

<b>tUP ABOVE,
</b>
tDeacon watches from the lip of the pit, amused. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttOf course, a strapping young woman 
ttlike yourself -- well I think you just 
ttmight be considered finger food.

tAnd with that, he's gone, stepping away from the pit.

<b>tINT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BLEEDING CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tWe are in a small, elevated antechamber which is situated above the
tmain vampire sanctuary.

<b>tBLADE, 
</b>
tnow weakened to the point of collapse, is being lashed to a rack-like
tdevice by iron chains. 

tMercury and her cohorts move efficiently, quickly securing him. When
tthey are through, the rack is hoisted up into the air via a series of
twinch-driven chains. 

tWith every turn of the winch crank, the chains are drawn tighter,
tcausing Blade to CRY OUT, until at last, he is suspended in mid-air,
tspread-eagle. 

<b>tFROST
</b>
tapproaches, still carrying Blade's sword.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttIt's been a long road, hasn't it? Such 
tta pity Whistler led you so far astray. 

tFrost cocks his head to the side, studying Blade's face.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttI don't blame you, though. I want you 
ttto know that. Even after all you've 
ttdone. I understand, Blade, I really 
ttdo. It's the human side of you which 
tthas corrupted your reasoning, made you 
ttweak. But we'll take care of that, 
ttwon't we?

tBlade struggles to lift his head, forcing himself to match Frost's
tgaze, shaking with hatred.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI'd kill myself -- before I turned 
ttinto something like you.

tFrost just smiles and shakes his head.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttNo you wouldn't. I'm going to bleed 
ttyou dry, Blade. All the poison that 
ttmakes you human. 
ttt(drawing closer)
ttWhen the Tide comes, you'll be begging 
ttme put you through the Change. 

tFrost lifts up Blade's sword, methodically slitting Blade's wrists
tone by one. He makes the cuts lengthwise, opening up the cephalic and
tbasilic veins with surgical precision.

tBlood wells up from the fresh wounds, running down Blade's forearms,
tcollecting in a cistern beneath his feet. 

tFrost watches the steady, inexorable process, then nods, satisfied.
tHe looks to the others who are gathered behind him, watching on with
tsilent reverence.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttIt's done. We should ready ourselves 
ttfor the ritual of invocation.

tFrost leads Mercury, Quinn, and the others from the sanctuary.

tBlade struggles futilely against his bonds, crying out in
tfrustration, his body eventually sagging from exhaustion. 

<b>ttttVANESSA (O.S.)
</b>ttThere's no use fighting us, Jason. 

tBlade looks up, focusing now on --

<b>tVANESSA, 
</b>
twho has remained behind. Blade stares at her. As terrible as his
tphysical torment is, his mother's betrayal is infinitely worse.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttHow could you be a part of this?

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttThese are my people now. I'm one of 
ttthem.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou don't have to be. 

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttYou don't understand. I've killed, 
ttI've hunted, and I've enjoyed it. 

tShe draws closer, caressing her son's face. There's just a hint of
tcreepy eroticism in her action, a dash of incest. 

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttI wish you could see the world as I 
ttdo. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no 
ttturning back from that.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI don't believe that.

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttYou will. Time is on our side. Sooner 
ttor later, the Thirst always wins.

tVanessa turns away now. Blade cries after her --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttMother!

tVanessa pauses, looking back, smiling cruelly.

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttYour mother died the night you
ttwere born. 

tAnd with that, she's gone, melting into the shadows. 

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. THE BONE PIT - NIGHT 
</b>
tKaren rises, wary, taking in her shadowed surroundings. 

<b>tHEAPS OF HUMAN BONES
</b>
tare piled against the pit walls -- skulls, rib-cages, femurs, tibias
t-- all picked clean of flesh. Some of the skulls have large, canine-
tlike fangs -- the remnants, no doubt, of long-deceased vampires.

tSuddenly we hear a WHISPER of sorts, the soft CLINKING of bone
tfragments grinding together --

tKaren spins, trying to place the source of the sound. Then she hears
tthe SOUND again. Behind her now, closer.

<b>ttttREVENANT (O.S.)
</b>ttKarennnnn --

tKaren looks up with a growing sense of dread.

<b>tA FACE
</b>
temerges from the darkness. Pallid, cadaverous, shedding its
tdesiccated flesh. Lidless eyes like black marbles slick with
tVaseline. A mouth like a raw wound. 

<b>ttttREVENANT
</b>ttKarreennnnnn. I never thought I'd see 
ttyou againnnnn.

tKaren backs away, realizing who she's standing before.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttCurtis?!

tWhat used to be Curtis SNARLS, knocking Karen back into the drift-
tpile of bones. It pins her to the ground, kneeling above her,
tgurgling through its gutted trachea.

<b>ttttCURTIS REVENANT
</b>ttTell, me, Karennn -- ever have second 
ttthoughts -- about us?

tKaren SCREAMS, trying to force the revenant away from her, but it
tlunges closer, lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a
tpathetic approximation of a French kiss.

tShe fumbles behind her, choking, grabbing hold of a human femur,
tblindly swinging it upward --

tCRACK! The blow shatters the Curtis-thing's jaw. It rears back,
tfalling to the side. 

tKaren crawls out from under its weight, swinging the femur again and
tagain --

tCRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it
tback until the femur actually splinters in half. The creature's head
thangs at an awkward angle now, its neck broken -- but still it
tadvances, dragging itself back up.

tSobbing, Karen retreats, clutching the splintered femur like a
tmakeshift dagger.

tCurtis charges at her, a blur of slashing claws. At the last moment,
tKaren ducks, thrusting the bone dagger up into Curtis' chest --

tCurtis impales himself, right through the heart. For one split-
tsecond, his eyes widen in surprise --

t-- and then he goes into a death-spasm, vomiting up a spray of
tcaustic vampire blood-bile, spattering Karen. She sinks to her knees,
tGASPING, as the thing that used to be Curtis shrivels up, melting
taway into burbling puddle.

tAfter a beat, Karen rises and moves to the pit wall, running her
thands over the lichen-slick surface, searching for a way out. The
tmortar between the brickwork is ancient, crumbling. 

tKaren looks to the ground, reaching for one of the splintered femurs.
tShe pounds it into the mortar between two bricks -- and it holds,
tworking as a makeshift piton.

tKaren reaches for another broken femur, lodging it a foot above the
tfirst. She hauls her body up now, suspending her weight from the two
tmakeshift pitons. Again, they hold.

tTrembling from exertion, Karen pulls the right piton free, hanging
tsolely from her left hand now. Though her handhold is precarious, she
tmanages to swing the right hand up again, pounding that piton another
tfoot above the left.

tIn this slow, torturous manner, Karen begins to climb her way up out
tof the pit.

<b>tINT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BLEEDING CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade hangs from his chains, head slack, eyes half-lidded and
tlusterless. His skin has grown ashen as his life's blood has been
tbled away.

tMercury appears before him, accompanied by Quinn. She bends in close
tto kiss Blade lightly on the lips.

<b>ttttMERCURY
</b>ttIt won't be long now, lover. 

tQuinn draws alongside her, hefting Blade's punching dagger. He places
tit against Blade's throat, slowly applying pressure. At this point,
tBlade's too weak to even resist.

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttWe should finish him off.

<b>ttttMERCURY
</b>ttt(shaking her head)
ttNo. Deacon wants him turned.

tQuinn releases Blade, disgusted. 

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttFucking waste, if you ask me.

tAs Mercury and Quinn exit, the CAMERA DROPS DOWN to the cistern
tbeneath Blade's feet. We follow the blood which has collected there
tas it flows into a crude drain and --

<b>tINT. SANCTUARY - NIGHT 
</b>
t-- emerges from the ceiling of the sanctuary below. The stream of
tblood is directed down the channels of a spiral column, where it
tfinally pools into a waiting chalice.

<b>tPULL BACK TO REVEAL

tthe sanctuary in full. A large circular chamber, the perimeter of
twhich is lined with recessed alcoves housing the remains of the
tvampire ancients, set into the sanctuary walls like cells in a hive.

<b>tDEACON FROST
</b>
tstands in the center of the chamber, allowing Vanessa to clothe him
tin ceremonial regalia -- gleaming, centuries-old armor. He pauses,
tkissing her hungrily.

tHaving finished suiting up, he turns to face the vampires who have
tbeen faithful to his cause -- Mercury, Quinn, a host of others. A
thush settles upon them. There's an excitement in the air, a sense
tthat something remarkable is about to happen.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttTonight is the night we've waited our 
ttentire lives for. Tonight, the 
ttblood-dimmed Tide is loosed upon the 
ttworld. Tonight, the Age of Man comes 
ttto an end. 

tThe vampires bellow out a CHORUS OF CHEERS, their voices resonating
toff the stone walls like thunder. 

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - BONE PIT - NIGHT
</b>
tKaren's hands appear over the lip of the bone pit. She heaves herself
tup, collapsing onto the floor --

t-- but there's no time to rest. Even now she can hear the VAMPIRES
tCHEERING. She drags herself to her feet, letting the voices guide
ther.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tKaren slips around a corner, guarded, searching. She SEES Blade
tstrung up before her, seemingly lifeless.

tKaren studies the chains which bind Blade, following them back to
ttheir source at the winch. She releases the brake on the winch crank,
tsending the chains RATTLING down through the overhead pulleys which
tsuspend them. 

tBlade crumples to the floor, lying still. Karen is at his side in an
tinstant --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(whispering, urgent)
ttBlade.

tBlade's eyes flicker open, fixing on her. Inhuman. He's shaking
tlike an alcoholic going into delirium tremens.

<b>tINT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT
</b>
tVanessa hands Frost the chalice containing Blade's blood. He lifts it
tup for all to see. The vampires begin to chant en masse, some long-
tforgotten invocation in the vampire tongue.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttt(grinning, to himself)
tt"And what rough beast, its hour come 
ttround at last, slouches towards 
ttBethlehem to be born?"

tFrost lifts the chalice to his lips and begins to drink. 

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade tries to sit up, gripping Karen's wrist --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttGet out of here --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttI'm not leaving without you.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou don't understand. The Thirst --

tHe clutches his stomach, experiencing phenomenal pain.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(gasping)
tt-- tearing me -- apart.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttI know. Take some of my blood.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttNo --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttIt's the only way. You know that. 
ttWe'll never get out of here alive if 
ttyou don't.

tBlade suppresses a shudder. Simply keeping himself from attacking her
ttakes every ounce of his resolve.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttI can't -- I won't be able to stop --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttYes you will. The human side of you is 
ttstronger. I know it is.

tKaren matches Blade's gaze, steeling herself. The truth is, she's
tterrified. 

tBlade stares back at her. At this moment, he wants what Karen is
toffering more than anything he's ever desired. And so he rises --

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. TEMPLE OF NIGHT - SANCTUARY - NIGHT
</b>
tFrost continues drinking down the blood, when suddenly, a force
tseizes his body. He throws his head back, eyes rolling to white,
tflinging the chalice aside.

tAnd as the vampire incantation reaches a fevered pitch, we SEE the
tstone tomb tablets off the vampire ancestors beginning to judder --
tas if some force within were trying to break free --

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tKaren turns her head to the side, baring her neck, offering herself
tto Blade. Blade opens his mouth. His canines elongate. He lowers his
thead --

t-- and starts to feed. Karen involuntarily stiffens as Blade's teeth
tpuncture her skin and we --

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT
</b>
tFrost shakes, possessed by an unseen force. A wind picks up from
tnowhere, swirling about the chamber, accompanied by a strange
<b>tHUMMING. 
</b>
tSuddenly, one of the tombs BURSTS OPEN. A WRAITH-LIKE SPIRIT rushes
toutward in a fountain of light, penetrating Frost's body.

tThen ANOTHER TOMB SPLITS APART. Then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER -- until a
ttorrent of SPIRIT-WRAITHS are surging into Frost, buffeting him about
tlike a scarecrow in a cyclone.

tMercury, Vanessa, and the other vampires back away, apprehensive,
thumbled by what they're witnessing.

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
tBlade moans, sinking his teeth deeper. Karen's head rolls back. Her
teyes open -- glassy, unseeing -- as a wave of ecstasy overtakes her. 

tShe shudders, her breath quickening, falling into a synchronous
trhythm with Blade's. Her fingers dig deep into his back, clawing
tdownward, tearing into him -- 

tShe's not Karen anymore -- she's a red blood cell, an erythrocyte,
tspinning in a river of plasma, roaring up Blade's femoral artery,
tracing towards the pumping chambers of his heart which beats like the
tdeafening breath of God, which blots all other sounds out of
texistence and we're --

<b>tCUTTING BACK AND FORTH NOW
</b>
tbetween Frost's transformation and Blade's, each of them growing
tstronger by the second, caught in an ever-increasing feedback loop of
texpanding energy until --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b><b>ttNO!!!!
</b>
tBlade tears himself from Karen, his pulse racing as -- 

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT
</b>
t-- the invocation of LaMagra reaches critical mass. Frost is consumed
tby a hellish force, unable to withstand the onslaught of spirit
tenergy any longer. 

<b>tCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
t-- Karen clawing at Blade, tears streaming down her cheeks.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttDon't stop --

tBut Blade grips her by her shoulders, shoving her back. Karen stares
tat Blade, wide-eyed, as if waking from a trance. She touches the raw
twounds on her neck, shaken --

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttMy God --

tBlade rises to his full height. His strength has more than returned,
tit's been doubled by the infusion of real blood. And there's
tsomething else in his gaze now too -- an animal fury that was missing
tbefore. Blade has taken one giant step closer to the darkness. 

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttt(hesitant)
ttAre you -- all right?

tBlade pulls at the chains manacled to his wrists, SNAPPING them apart
tlike toys. He flexes his hands -- fingernails lengthening to tapered
tpoints. And he smiles, offering us a view of his canines, which have
telongated into fangs.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(near-demonic)
ttNever been better.

<b>tINT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT
</b>
tThe aftermath. Smoke hangs heavy in the air, occluding the area where
tFrost had stood. As it dissipates, Mercury and the others creep
tforward, apprehensive --

<b>ttttMERCURY
</b>ttDeacon?

<b>tFROST
</b>
tstands with his back to us, his body trailing wisps of occult fumes.
tAs he slowly turns, we catch a glimpse of his eyes -- burning with an
tawesome, inner fire. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttNo longer.

<b>ttttBLADE (O.S.)
</b>ttFrost!!!

tAll heads turn --

<b>tBLADE 
</b>
tstands at the balcony overhead, Karen at his side. He leaps from it,
tsomersaulting down to the floor below, landing on his feet like a
tpredatory cat.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWho dies first?

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttt(growling, to the others)
ttTake him.

tQuinn GROWLS, stepping forward, armed with Blade's punching dagger.
tHe offers his second "new hand" up for view. 

<b>ttttQUINN
</b>ttGrew another hand for you sweetmeat --
ttt(tossing the dagger to his new hand)
tt-- and now I'm gonna kill you with it.

tQuinn charges. Blade meets the vampire head-on, dropping into a low
tkick and sweeping the vampire's legs out from under him. He spins
tbehind Quinn -- 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttLet's see if you can grow a new one
ttof these!

tBlade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket
tsleeve, pulling out a retractable strangle-wire which he twists
taround Quinn's throat. 

tBlade tightens the wire, decapitating Quinn. The headless body
tstaggers about, then drops to the cavern floor. Blade scoops up his
tpunching dagger --

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttNext?

tMercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse. Blade
tlaunches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamp's face, SNAPPING
tits neck --

tMercury has Blade's .454 Casulls. She aims them at him --

<b>ttttMERCURY
</b>ttHave a taste of your own medicine!

tAs she FIRES, Blade tucks and rolls, knocking one of the guns from
ther hand. The guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up
tby --

<b>tKAREN,
</b>
twho takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away.

tMeanwhile, Blade traps Mercury's other hand, disarming her, flipping
ther over his shoulder. He hefts his Casull, BLASTING her into
teternity --

tA bloodbath ensues. Blade moves like speed-personified, FIRING off
tone, two, THREE HEADSHOTS with brain-numbing accuracy, cutting down
tthe vampires where they stand. 

tIt's an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and
t-CLICK-CA-CHING-CLICK!- Blade and Karen have spent their bullets
tand --

<b>ttttFROST (O.S.)
</b>ttEnough!!!

tBlade turns to face --

<b>tFROST, 
</b>
twho's advancing, clutching Blade's own sword in his hand. He thrusts
tthe sword forward --

tBlade presses the grip-trigger on his punching dagger -CHING!- the
ttwo side blades spread out. We hear the RASP and CLANG of metal on
tmetal as Blade manages to trap the sword-point between two of the
tdagger blades --

tFor a moment, both men are eye to eye, their weapons locked together,
tthen, Frost forces Blade backwards --

tWhat happens next is the most blindingly-fast sword fight ever
texposed to celluloid. Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge
tand spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves.

tFrost lands a powerful blow on Blade's shoulder, the sword-edge
tbiting deep into the flesh. Blade SCREAMS. Frost withdraws the sword
tfor another strike --

t-- until Blade sees an opening and takes it, slicing Frost's left arm
toff at the shoulder --

tThe severed arm releases Blade's sword, but the arm doesn't fall! To
tFrost and Blade's mutual surprise the arm floats in mid-air, bleeding
tred, quivering like zero-G liquid, then SLURPING back to Frost's arm-
tstump to re-attach itself!

tUndaunted, Blade slices the punching dagger into Frost's mid-section,
tmeeting only liquid-like resistance. The moment Blade withdraws his
tdagger, Frost's flesh seals itself up again.

tBlade hesitates now, uncertain -- and Frost laughs, understanding
twhat has happened.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttYou're too late, Blade. I'm already 
ttchanging. Don't you see? The Sleeper 
tthas awakened. I'm not just Frost 
ttanymore. I'm becoming a god now, 
ttblood incarnate.

tEven as Frost utters the words, his body begins to ripple and morph,
tbleeding red, taking on the characteristics of liquid. He doesn't
twalk so much now as flow. He's become a three-dimensional creature of
tanimated blood! A blood demon.

<b>tON KAREN,
</b>
tas she watches Frost's transformation, wide-eyed. She SEES Blade's
tdiscarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the
tperiphery of her vision --

<b>tVANESSA
</b>
trushes at Karen in a near-blur. The SNARLING hellion is upon Karen in
tan eye-blink, SLAMMING her down against the temple floor, pinning
ther. 

<b>ttttVANESSA
</b>ttDid you think I'd forgotten you, you 
ttlittle whore?

<b>tBACK TO FROST,
</b>
twho towers above Blade, swaying back and forth in his new, liquid-
tlike form.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttYou can't hurt me anymore. 

tWHOOSH! Frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood, HOWLING
tWITH LAUGHTER, then just as suddenly --

t-- splashes back to earth, spreading out in a widening pool. In the
tblink of an eye, he streams through Blade's feet, re-solidifying
tbehind Blade. Blade spins, swings his dagger --

tOnce again, Frost morphs into blood-form. He races around Blade in a
tseries of spouting arcs, turning from blood-form to solid and back
tagain in a series of split-second transformations.

tBlade whirls, striking with his dagger and missing every time --

tWHOOSH! Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million
tzero-G blood bubbles, vanishing. Blade spins, unnerved, trying to
tpin-point his foe's next manifestation.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttWhere are you?!

tFrost's voice answers from all directions.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttEverywhere.

<b>tA DROPLET OF BLOOD
</b>
tspatters the floor at Blade's feet. Blade looks up --

<b>tA SHOWER OF BLOOD
</b>
trains from above, coalescing into Frost as he sweeps down on Blade
tlike a giant bird of prey, crushing him against the temple floor. 

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttYou want my blood so much?! Take it!

tFrost's arms elongate and liquefy, flowing into two snake-like spouts
tof blood -- the rest of Frost remains solid. The blood-spouts twist
taround Blade's neck, melding together, completely encasing Blade's
thead in a bubble of blood.

tBlade claws at the blood-bubble as if it were a solid object that he
tcould dislodge, but his fingers just pass through it!

<b>tBACK TO VANESSA
</b>
tas she wraps a hand around Karen's throat, choking her.

tAs Karen struggles, she frees a hand, sliding it down to her hip
tpocket, digging something out -- Whistler's vampire mace canister!

tShe forces it up between them, triggering a jet of TOXIC MIST into
tVanessa's face --

tVanessa recoils, HOWLING, her head smoking as if it were doused with
tformic acid, skin sloughing off from her skull. Karen lunges for
tBlade's sword --

<b>tBACK TO FROST AND BLADE
</b>
tBlade is drowning in Frost's blood. His eyes bulge. Oxygen bubbles
tstream from his mouth. Frost leans in close, his face a twisted mask
tof insanity.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttI was wrong about you, Blade. You were 
ttnever one of us. You're a traitor to 
ttyour race. 

<b>ttttKAREN (O.S.)
</b>ttGet away from him!

tFrost looks up -- Karen is wielding Blade's sword. She brings it down
ton Frost, severing the blood-tendrils which envelope Blade. The
tblood-bubble dissolves instantly, flowing away from Blade's face. He
tgasps, chokes in air --

tFrost backs away, horrified. His blood-tendrils don't reform.
tInstead, the lay where they fell, solidifying into crystalline
tpowder.

<b>ttttKAREN
</b>ttBlade!

tKaren flings the sword at Blade. 

<b>tTHE SWORD 
</b>
tspins end over end, its mirrored surface reflecting coruscating
tpinwheels of candlelight as Blade catches the weapon by its hilt.

tBlade rises, advancing on Frost, sword outstretched and Frost
tretreats, uncertain now.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttGuess you're not quite as invulnerable 
ttas you thought.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttYou're wrong -- a few minutes more, and 
ttmy transition will be complete. Even 
ttyour sword won't be able to affect me 
ttthen.

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttYou don't have a few minutes, Frost.

tFrost eyes Blade warily, then lunges towards Vanessa, sweeping behind
ther. Blade follows, but even as he raises his sword to strike, Frost
tspins Vanessa around, using her body as a shield!

tBlade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his
tmother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's
tpoisonous mace. Piteous, really. 

tFrost smiles, for he's found a final weakness of Blade's to exploit.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttt(laughing cruelly)
ttJust as I thought. Still chained to 
ttyour mother's breast after all these 
ttyears.

tIn the same instant, Vanessa's features morph, taking on the angelic,
tyouthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo.

<b>ttttFROST
</b>ttt(gloating)
ttYou're too human, Blade. 

<b>ttttBLADE
</b>ttt(steeling himself)
ttIt's because I'm human that I can do 
ttthis.

tFrost's eyes widen in shock, but he has no time to react, for --

tBlade is already LUNGING forward, driving the sword-point through
tVanessa's chest, on into Frost's heart! It strikes the stone behind
tthem, SHATTERING and --

tFrost and Vanessa HOWL AS ONE, their SCREAMS rising to an unendurable
tintensity as the two vampires go nova, exploding into an expanding
tball of light and ATOMIZING BLOOD.

tBlade is thrown back off his feet, having to shield his eyes from the
tbacklash of occult energy as a near tidal WAVE of blood surges over
thim --

tEvery door and window of the bank is BLOWN OUTWARD from the force of
tthe EXPLOSION. While along the street, manhole covers flip from their
tmoorings, spinning up into the air like dimes, being buoyed by
tgeysers of blood.

<b>tINT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT
</b>
tSilence, just the steady DRIP-DRIP of liquid draining. The underworld
ttemple gleams with a crimson sheen now. 

<b>tON BLADE 
</b>
tas he stirs. He's been blown clear across the sanctuary by the force
tof the blast, soaked to the quick by blood. He rises to his feet,
tretrieving the hilt of his shattered weapon. At his feet --

</b>
tlies in pieces. Amidst them, we find the singed remains of the locket

tto pick it up.
