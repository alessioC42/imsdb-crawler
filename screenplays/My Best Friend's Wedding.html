</b>
<b>tINT.  BOULEY RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - NIGHT
</b>
tDim lighting, crowd buzz, a long line of the rich, the celebrated,
tthe congenitally impatient.  Everyone in this queue holds a
treservation at least an hour overdue.  Tourists can't even make the
tline.  PAN ahead to...

t... the burnished dining room, the tables of power, the elegant
tservice.  Covertly, many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving
tby far the most lavish service of all.  Captains hover, presenting
tdelicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose
tperson they screen from our view.  We can see, however...

t... the honored guest's companion.  Ignored, bemused, across the
ttable.  This is DIGGER DOWNES, 36, darkly attractive.  Kind eyes,
tan intellectual's mouth, Saville Row's most unobtrusive and
tconservative chalk-stripe suit.  He is gay, but you wouldn't guess
tit.  Loyal and wise and generous, and you might.  He watches with a
tquiet twinkle, as the Captains now step back, revealing to us...

t... their most unlikely icon.  JULIANNE POTTER, almost 28, wears
ther favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled
ttogether in fifteen seconds.  She is unkempt, quick, volatile,
tscattered, and beneath it all, perhaps because of it all, an
toriginal beauty.  Dark liquid eyes, a cynical mouth, slender
texpressive fingers, which point to...

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>tt    A variation on our squid ink
tt    risotto.  Trace of Moselle, to
tt    sweeten the stock.

tShe doesn't like that idea at all.  Shoots him a sharp look of
tdoubt that makes him smile.  Murmur...

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>tt    Don't kill us on this one, it's
tt    a long shot.

tPlaces the moist lump of black rice before her.  She takes a
tsurprisingly small amount, rolls it over her tongue.  Makes dead
tflat eye contact with Digger.  And nods, it's actually quite nice.
tThe Captain breathes with relief.  She turns her dark eyes to him.
tThe tone says they're pals...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'm writing it up as inventive and
tt    confident.  Which it is.  Off the
tt    record, I'll need an extra boat of
tt    the ink.  Or a salt shaker.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>tt    I'll toss a coin.

tAs the Captain splits, Digger looks around at the other tables,
twhich makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Is it ever embarrassing, having
tt    your bum kissed in public?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    If your ass isn't chapped, you
tt    are not a good-writer of note.

tShe glances at her two remaining waiters, who shamelessly fawn
tnearby.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Is it sad to be an editor, and bask
tt    only in reflected insincerity?

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.

tShe leans forward, as if sharing something conspiratorial.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    See the pull of a book like
tt    Twenty Chefs, is not who I
tt    put in.  It's who I leave out.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Which is everyone you couldn't
tt    get in.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Plus some guys whose food I don't
tt    like.

tPushes the risotte across to him.  He lifts a fork.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    This fellow from Newsday ever
tt    call?

tShe shrugs.  Pulls a cellular out of a large, jumbled bag.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'll buzz my machine.  Inventive
tt    and confident, yeh?

tShe dials.  He tastes.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Needs salt.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Is Newsday a real interview, or
tt    just some cute guy you're setting
tt    me up w...

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    ... I don't send you men, anymore.
tt    You don't know what to do with them.

tShe's punching in her code.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    ... weeks.

tOver the phone, we hear her answering machine...

ttttMAN'S VOICE (V.O., soft)
tt    Hey.  It's Michael.

tAnd her face changes.  Warms.  Just to hear the guileless voice.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    God, it must be, what, months, huh?
tt    I can't wait to talk to you.  I'm
tt    in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton...

tShe looks impressed and surprised.  Fancy place for this guy.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    Call me four in the morning,
tt    whatever, we gotta talk.

tAs she hangs up.  She still has that look in her eye.  Digger has
tnever seen that, and he likes it very much.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Who called? The man of the
tt    moment?

tShe smiles.  A sweet, natural smile that makes us like her, too.
tThe Bohemian sophisticate has vanished.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    No, no, the opposite.  That's
tt    my best friend, Michael O'Neal.
tt    He sounds desperate to talk.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    The wandering sportswriter.

tHe pushes the risotto back her way.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    I didn't know you two had a
tt    past.

tHer gaze sharpens.  Hmmn?

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    The look in your eye.

tShe blushes.  Shakes her head, no way.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Sophomore year at Yale we had
tt    this one hot month.  And, you
tt    know me, I got restless...

tHe knows her.  She got restless.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    So I get up the nerve to break
tt    his heart.  I tell him there's
tt    this dreamy exchange student
tt    from Pakistan who wants to,
tt    you know...

tHe knows.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    And he gets this... look.  He
tt    says, "I knew I couldn't hold
tt    your interest", which, of course,
tt    makes me feel like the shallow
tt    bitch I've always been...

tHe nods, yeah.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Then he says, "But what makes
tt    me want to cry.  Is I'm losing
tt    the best friend I ever had."

tHears the feeling.  In her voice.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    And when he said it, I knew.
tt    I felt the same.

tSilence now.  She covers with a smile.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    So I cried.  For maybe the third
tt    time in my life.  And I kissed
tt    him.  And we've been best friends
tt    ever since.

tEver since.  Fingers turning her wine glass...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Nine years, we've seen each other
tt    through everything.  Losing jobs,
tt    losing parents, losing lovers...
tt    travelled all over, we've had the
tt    best times.  The best times of my
tt    life, maybe.  Just drinking and
tt    talking.  Even over a phone.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Kindred spirits.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    No, he's nothing like me.  He's
tt    like you.  Only straight.

tNo offense taken.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    He's the salt of the earth.  Kind
tt    and loyal and generous.  The one
tt    constant thing in my life, is he'll
tt    always be there.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    He's still in love with you.

tThat stops her.  She has to say...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Maybe.  But it never gets in
tt    the way.

tSomething she probably hasn't confessed out loud before.  Digger
tunderstands.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Well, he has a true friend in
tt    you.

tHe wants her to know he sees that.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Whenever George tells someone
tt    how steadfast I am, he always
tt    makes me sound boring.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Solid and genuine is not boring.
tt    Michael can be completely insane...

tA young waiter arrives.  Sets a boat of black squid ink beside her
tplate.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    There was this one night in
tt    Tucson, like six years ago...
tt    we got amazingly drunk, I mean,
tt    Keith Richards time...

tThe kid tops off her glass of meursault.  Looking at her.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    God, I haven't thought of this
tt    in so long...

tThe waiter hanging now.  Openly listening.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I can even believe we did
tt    this...

tDigger sees the guy listening, gestures to her with his eyes.  So
tshe looks up.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Could you give us a minute?

tThe kid stunned, speechless.  People lose jobs for a lot less.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You won't miss much, I promise
tt    there was no sex.

tHe reddens and disappears.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    I've lost interest.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    He takes a razor from his dinky
tt    little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip,
tt    takes my hand, does the same to me...

tShe places the tips of her index fingers together.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Blood oath.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    He says, "Swear.  When we're both
tt    28, if we've never been married...
tt    we marry each other!"

tAnd laughs again.  Can you believe that?  But Digger isn't smiling.
tShe wonders why.  Begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    See, he figured that would be a
tt    sign from God, or someone of
tt    comparable authority, that we'd
tt    misunderstood our destinies.

tHe still has this real serious look.  She's still spooning ink.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    We never talked about it again.  I
tt    don't know what made me think of...

ttttDIGGER (quietly)
tt    I do.

tAnd everything.  Stops.  She lifts her spoon, mesmerized by the
tgravity of his tone.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    You'll be 28 in three weeks.
tt    How old is he?

tHoly.  Fucking.  Shit.  It hits her like a ton of lead bricks.  She
tshovels some swampy risotto into her mouth, without looking.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You think...

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Desperate.  To talk.

tShe shovels in more drippy black goop.  It is really disgusting.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    He's not proposing marriage,
tt    there's no way I'm buying one
tt    word of th...

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Then why are you compulsively
tt    eating? If you're not hysterical?

tMore goes in.  Her lips and mouth completely black.  Like a circus
tclown.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    He can't do that to me!

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    We're about to find out.

tInk is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down
ther face.  She absently dabs a napkin, keeping some of it from
treaching her sweater.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    When I turn him down...

tShe realizes the full weight of the truth.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    We'll never be the same.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    I have a suggestion...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'll have to kill myself before I
tt    call him.

tStaring in each other's eyes.

ttttDIGGER (sadly)
tt    That was it.

<b>tINT. JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT
</b>
tJulianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush.
tGray foam pours from her mouth, spattering the oversized basketball
tjersey she wears as a nightshirt.  In the mirror, her troubled eyes
tdwell on Michael, flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on
tthe closed toilet lid.

tShe spits, sticks her tongue way out.  Incredibly black.  Great.
tDepressed, terrified, and disfigured for life.  She snatches up the
thated phone, and wanders aimlessly into...

t... her bedroom.  West Village view.  Defiantly jumbled, aggres-
tsively eclectic.  Traces of wonderful taste mixed with I-like-it-
tyou-got-a-problem-with-that? She stumbles around, rehearsing...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    This is awkward timing, Michael,
tt    I just joined this convent, and
tt    they never give your deposit ba...

tStops.  Full-length mirror.  She straightens her hair, to look her
tbest.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Michael, I'm married.

tNot enough.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    ... and I have two weeks to live.

tChanges tone...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Michael, I'm trying to be gay,
tt    don't confuse me.

tShe turns to continue pacing, and walks straight INTO a dresser.
tStuns her, momentarily.  Enough, already! She punches up the
tnumber, primping absently in the mirror.  When it connects...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I was calling Michael O'Neal,
tt    but seeing it's so late, I could
tt    just leave a mes...

tNo such luck.  Cut off.  Waits.  And then...

ttttJULIANNE (soft)
tt    Good evening, sir.  You've been

tt    The Month Club, and th...

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    Hey! God, it's so good to hear
tt    your voice.

tShe forgets herself.  Because it's good to hear his, too.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    I've been calling for days!

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Yeh, well my old machine kept
tt    eating messages.  I tried
tt    constructively ignoring it in
tt    hopes of improvement, but finally...

ttttMICHAEL (V.O., urgent)
tt    Look, I have to ask you something.

tShe swallows.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    Something so incredibly important,
tt    that if you turn me down, I don't
tt    know what I'll d...

ttttJULIANNE (bright)
tt    I just have to tell you this one
tt    thing first, okay? I mean this
tt    will hand you the biggest laugh
tt    of your adult life...

tSilence.  Come on girl, suck it up.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I was thinking about you, and I
tt    remembered this unbelievably insane
tt    night we spent together in Tucson,
tt    like a thousand years ago?

tMore silence.  Really quiet.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I mean, there's no way you could
tt    possibly remember the...

ttttMICHAEL (V.O., soft)
tt    Are you kidding?

tStops her.  Like a brick wall.  The sweetness in his voice.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    I think about that night all
tt    the time.

tShe's going to have a heart attack.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    But it's not why I called.

tShe blinks.  It's not.  And just as a tsunami of relief begins to
tsweep away...

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    I called because I met someone.

tAnd her smiles breaks off.  Like a spine snapping.  Because there is
tsomething in his voice.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Well, that's great.  You haven't
tt    really had anybody since Dingbat
tt    Jennylee...

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    You don't understand.  I've never
tt    felt this way about anybody!

tNever.  She sits down, hard.  Right on the floor.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    And she's all wrong for me!

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Well, somet...

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    I mean she's a junior at Chicago
tt    University, she's twenty years
tt    old! Like when I first met you.

tLike when.  Julianne's mouth is suddenly dry.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    And her dad is like this billionaire
tt    who owns the White Sox and some cable
tt    empire, and you know how I've always
tt    been miserably awkward around those
tt    kinda stuffed suits...

tShe's finally making her mouth work...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Well, sure.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    But they're so down to earth, such
tt    wonderful people...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You've met her parents.

ttttMICHAEL (V.O., quiet)
tt    Well.  Sure.

tWow.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    See.  We're getting married.
tt    This Sunday.

tThere's a knife in her heart.  She can scarcely breathe.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Michael, it's Wednesday night,

tt    married on Su...

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    Actually, it all starts tomorrow.
tt    It's one of those four-day weddings,
tt    with all the traditional events, and
tt    ten million people flying in from
tt    Madagascar such.

ttttJULIANNE (incredibly lame)
tt    Aren't you... working this weekend?
tt    I mean, is that responsible?

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's

tt    ... Thomas, yeh.

tShe's staring at herself in the mirror.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    Jules.  I'm scared.

tA straw to lunge at.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Well, maybe we should talk ab...

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    I need you.

tSo heartfelt.  A lifetime of emotion welling in her eyes.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    If you can't come.  And hold my

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    W...
</b>
<b>ttttMICHAEL (V.O.)
</b>tt    I can't wait for you to meet her!

tHOLD ON Julianne.  Staring in the mirror.  Like watching the end of
ther life.

<b>tINT.  BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
tThe closet, the armoire, all the drawers are wide open.  Two huge
tsuitcases open on the bed, into which Julianne is flinging clothes,
tas she fumbles to smoke and dial at the same time.  Over the phone,
tnow...

ttttDIGGER (V.O., machine)
tt    You've reached Digger and George.
tt    Brevity will be appreciated.

<b>tBEEP.
</b>
ttttJULIANNE (in a rage)
<b>tt    IT'S ME AGAIN, WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS
</b><b>tt    UP HAVING SAFE SEX??
</b>
tSNATCHES up a tiny, clingy, sexy dress.  Pouts at it.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, WHY AREN'T
</b><b>tt    YOU INTERRUPTING IT TO ANSWER
</b><b>tt    THE PHONE??

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    YOU, YOU, YOU! IT'S ALL ABOUT

</b>
tShe clicks OFF.  Checks the dress in the mirror.  Raises the short
tskirt a little higher.

<b>tINT. DIGGER'S CHEROKEE, JFK AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING
</b>
tDigger driving the open-air Cherokee up the ramp to United Airlines
tdepartures.  Julianne, wind-whipped, trying to light a fresh
tcigarette from the butt of the last one.  He glances over.  Hates
tto see this...

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    You can't get lung cancer and
tt    die in four days.  Go to Plan B.

tShe sucks deep.  Really deep.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You have no appropriate sense
tt    of emergency.  My best friend
tt    is ruining his life.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    No, he's ruining yours.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Same difference.  If you love

tt    them from themselves.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    You have a real philosophy of
tt    life.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    It's called the Law of Love,
tt    asshole.

tShe is tight enough to snap.  And at the edge of tears.  Staring
tout at the skycaps, clinging to her cigarette, as he eases to the
tcurb.

ttttDIGGER (gently)
tt    Why don't we have a drink? You

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'm a busy girl.  I've got four
tt    days to break up a wedding, and

tShe finally looks at him.  He doesn't say anything.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    He's adored me for nine goddamn
tt    years.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    I can see why.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    She knows him maybe five seconds,
tt    plus she has billions of dollars,
tt    plus she's perfect, so don't go
tt    feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!

tHe's not.  So her voice softens.  Which shows the hurt.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    And don't go feeling sorry for
tt    me, you don't know me that well.
tt    We're only friends.

ttttDIGGER (softly)
tt    I stand corrected.

tTears now.  Stand in her eyes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'm making a big mistake, huh?

ttttDIGGER (shrugs)
tt    Maybe you'll learn something.

tHe wraps his hand over hers.  She looks down at it.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'm gonna bring him back, man.
tt    Against all odds, y'know.  Cos
tt    if I don't...

tShe wraps her fingers around his.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    ... I gotta live with it forever.

tLooks in his eyes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    And at my wedding.  I'll be the
tt    only bride with her own best man.

tAnd she kisses his cheek.

tJumps out of his car.  Before she cries.  Yanks her bags from the
tback.  Brave smile.

tThey trade small salutes.  And then she's gone.

<b>tINT.  O'HARA AIRPORT, CHICAGO - MORNING
</b>
tThe jetway disgorging passengers into the swarming ant colony
tcalled O'Hare.  Julianne lugging multiple carry-ons, trying to pull
tfly-away strands of hair into place, nervous as a schoolgirl,
tlooking all around, and...

t... there he is.  MICHAEL is tall and square-shouldered, a boyish
tgrin, an unruly shock of hair.  He looks gorgeous, sweet, and just
tdangerous enough to be irresistible.  Worthwhile stakes.  His face
tlights to see her, and she...

t... RUNS to his arms, shedding bags along the way, slamming off
theedless civilians, to be...

t... SWEPT OFF the earth in strong arms, spun around, laughing like
tcrazy, their cheeks tight together.  When he sets her down...

t... he kisses her nose.  His arms are still around her.

ttttMICHAEL (murmurs)

t... there she is.  KIMBERLY WALLACE is 20, small and slender, but it
tis a body to die for.  The face is striking, not at all perky and
tvapid, but lovely and interesting.  Worst of all, intelligent.

tShe walks toward them purposefully, her eyes locked to the woman in
ther fiancee's arms.  At the last moment, Michael releases Julianne

t... THROWS her arms around the startled visitor.  HOLDS her tight,
twith such genuine warmth that Julianne can only, slowly, hug back.
tAs Michael beams.

tKimmy TEARING down the throughway in her Mercedes 500 SL, a
tdashing, confident driver.  Julianne riding shotgun, hair flying, a
ttotal wreck, in the open convertible.  Michael is happily crouched
ton the little platform behind their seats, hugging his knees.  The

tfemale patrons.

tTakes a look at his watch.

<b>tINT.  DRESSING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
tA period sitting room, ringed with mirrors along its tapestried

tcostly gowns.  Watching with an expertise beyond her years, as...

t... Julianne stands on a platform.  A seamstress fitting her into a
tsleek pale daffodil-colored gown.  There are pins everywhere, as
tthe seamstress struggles toward a perfect fit.  Continuously
tlooking to Kim for approval.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    If you'd rather the lilac...

tJulianne shakes her head.  This one is beautiful.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I thought bridesmaids had to wear

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    Not you.  You won't be comfortable
tt    unless you're distinctive.

tJulianne glances over.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    What else did he tell you...

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    ... you hate weddings, you never go.

tOh.  Well, yeah.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    You're not up for anything
tt    conventional, or popularly
tt    assumed to be female priorities.
tt    Including marriage.  Or romance.
tt    Or even...

tAnd she stops.  Not wanting to offend.

ttttJULIANNE (quietly)
tt    ... not even love.

tThe look holds.  The seamstress keeps working, as if she's deaf.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    That's why Michael and I were
tt    the wrong fit.  Right from the
tt    start.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    He said that, too.

tShe stands up.  Walks to the platform.  Smooths her hand over the
tfabric down Julianne's back, along her hips.  Communicating to the
tseamstress with her irritated expression.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    Well, I thought I was like you.
tt    And proud to be.  Until I met
tt    rumpled, smelly old Michael...

tPins start to come out.  Kimmy points, these, too!

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    And then I found I was just a

tShe leans forward.  So they can look at each other.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    Funny world, huh?

tJulianne swallows.  It is that.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I need a smoke.

tAnd before anyone can breathe, she steps OFF the platform RIPPING
tthe living shit out of the gown, right down the side.  The seam-
tstress' eyes FLASH OPEN in abject horror.  Julianne, a deer in
theadlights, looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw-up in
tsix different mirrors.

tKimberly just steps to her, fingers the tear...

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    It's mostly the seam.  Let's

tAnd UNZIPS Julianne down the back.  In her rush to step out,

tand she just...

t... TOPPLES like a felled oak, THUDDING on her face, the gown
tRIPPING some more, the seamstress SCREAMING like an idiot.

tThen.  Silence.  Julianne looking up helplessly, a trussed hog,
tbound in her dress.

ttttKIMMY (firm)
tt     Just.  Don't.  Move.

tLike you talk to a three-year-old.  Deftly, Kimmy pulls the

tseamstress, let's go.

tcigarette from the butt of another.  Suddenly, she hears...

t... an ARGUMENT outside the door.  Strains to listen.  It does sound
tlike Michael and Kim.  We can't make out the words.  She jumps up,
tdashes for the door, STUBBING her toe on the platform, SHIT!, falls
theavily AGAINST the door with a THUD that makes her wince, and...

t... the argument stops.  Damn.  She opens the door a crack.  Sees
tnothing.  Opens it wider to reveal...

t... a teenaged BOY looking right at her.  He sends a true shit-
teating grin and she SLAMS the door hard enough to RATTLE walls.

tShe PACES furiously, helplessly, arms around her half-naked self,
tuntil...

t... soft knock.  The door opens a crack, and her daffodil gown
tcomes through it.

</b>tt    Come in, and shut the...

tStops.  Because it's Michael who has entered.  With the dress.

tSo he does.  She flushes and SNATCHES up her own clothes, which
twere characteristically tangled in a heap, and tries desperately to
tuntangle them enough to cover herself.  He is amazed and amused by
ther embarrassment.

ttttMICHAEL (laughing)
tt    Should I turn around, or someth...

<b>ttttMICHAEL

tShe seems ready to rip her clothes apart, so he gently takes them
tfrom her hands.  She tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily
tuntangles them.

<b>ttttMICHAEL

tHe walks to the door.  Puts his hand on the latch.  Looks back...

ttttMICHAEL (even softer)
tt    You're still a very pretty

tThe look holds.  And holds.  There is such feeling on both sides,

tAs he takes away the remaining beers...

tHot dog? His eyes fix on her left breast.  HUGE mustard stain.

tDrinking their beers.  Side by side.  Both stare only at the game.

<b>ttttMICHAEL

tAh.  Julianne nodding.  Reflecting.

<b>ttttMR.  MOONEY
</b>tt    An object that might represent

ttttKIMMY (under her breath)
tt    Don't even think dildo.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Could you do this...

tTossing an object on the counter...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    In 24 carat?

tIt is a MASTERCARD.  A gold one.

ttttKIMMY (softly)
tt    Bingo.

<b>ttttKIMMY

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    I just don't want to freak him

<b>tINT.  FASHION RESTAURANT - LUNCH HOUR
</b>

tthe maitre d'.  We CLOSE to hear...

<b>ttttMAITRE D'
</b>tt    Oh, Mr. Wallace and his guests
tt    have retired to the humidor.

tPoints to an escalator, leading to the mezzanine.  Behind a glass
twall, what looks like a British men's club.  Thirty guys and a
tbillion cigars.  As Julianne starts toward it...

<b>ttttMAITRE D'
</b>tt    Oh.  Mademoiselle.

tShe turns back.  Loves this shit.

<b>ttttMAITRE D'
</b>tt    It's unofficial, of course.  But,
tt    traditionally, the humidor is for
tt    gentlemen, only...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Great.  I've got this girlfriend
tt    at the Justice Department?  With
tt    all this time on her hands?

tHer look is every bit as hard as his.  He gestures to the
tescalator.  She takes Kimmy's hand, and up they go.  We can see
tWalter in a big leather chair, enjoying a major stogie.  Kimmy
tlicks her lips.

tThey enter.  Every head turns.  A nice range of reactions, from
toffended to attracted and points in between.

ttttJULIANNE (murmurs)
tt    Piece of cake.  I'll hang, and
tt    think happy thoughts...

tKimmy nods.  Heads over toward her father.  Julianne walks,
tconfidently, even provocatively, to the wall lined with bins of
tcigars.  Every eye in the place is on her butt.

tShe runs her fingers over a few contenders.  Plucks one out,
texamines it, puts it back.  Walks a little farther.  Selects
tanother, big and black.  Rolls it expertly in her fingers.  Sniffs
talong its length.

tA guy comes over.  Could be 40, successful, a broker's pin-stripe.
tNearly as attractive as he thinks he is.

<b>ttttGUY
</b>tt    Know what you're looking for,

tLittle lady, huh? She glances at his coven of buddies, who pretend
tnot to notice.  Then, straight to the guy's blue eyes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Yeah.  Do you?

<b>ttttGUY
</b>tt    I asked first.

tAh.  Wit.  She holds up her cigar...

tRuns it under her nose.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Smell is important, I'm a believer

tTakes a match from a cut crystal bowl.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    But you never know what you've
tt    got.  Till you run your tongue
tt    over it.

tAnd she does.  Moistening the full length of the cigar.  The boys
tare laughing openly.  She STRIKES the match.  As she lights up...

<b>ttttGUY
</b>tt    I meant.  What you're looking for
tt    in a man.

tShe glances at his wedding ring.  Then, straight into his eyes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Actually, I'm partial to married
tt    gentlemen.

tThe way she says that.  The guy swallows.  We can see some of the
tair has been sucked from the room.

<b>ttttGUY
</b>tt    Why is that?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    It's so much time.  When I phone
tt    the wives.

tExplosive LAUGHTER from the peanut gallery.  As she jams the big
tClemente Churchill into her mouth, she sees Kimmy waving her over
tfrom across the room.  Without even looking at the guy she's just
tput away...

t... she crosses the room, Walter stands politely, looking very
tdapper, very powerful, and focusing on her with considerable
tinterest.  He waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather
thassock.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt    (simply)

tShe can't read this guy.  Maybe that's how he built an empire.  She
tnods, yeah.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    You're a woman of insight.

tHe sits on the arm of his chair.  Close enough to speak quietly.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    My wife and I love this marriage,
tt    and deplore its circumstances.

tHe puffs his cigar.  Julianne puffs her.  Kimmy looks on, a kid
twatching the grown-ups...

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    As you guessed, my daughter is
tt    unhappy about giving up her life.
tt    And, in my opinion, cowardly in
tt    avoiding the necessary confrontation.

tThen he stops.  As if reading Julianne's eyes.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    Mike has a world of ability.
tt    I'd do anything to have him in
tt    my company.

tOne more puff.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    Except ask him.

tJulianne is a little stunned.  Kimmy looks helpless.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    He'd resent it.  And me.  And,
tt    most important, Kim.

tNo smile on his lips.  Straight talk.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    He's a great kid, but he's still
tt    a kid.  Instead of recognizing
tt    that his resistance comes from
tt    insecurity, he'd turn it to anger.
tt    To protect himself...

tSpreads his hands...

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    ... from realizing that he's
tt    ignoring my daughter's needs,
tt    despite how very much he loves her.

tHe looks to his daughter now.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    They both have some growing up
tt    to do.  But they're good people,
tt    they're starting with love.
tt    They've got time.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>ttt    (softly)
tt    I think you're making a mistake,
tt    sir.

tHis eyes come back to her.  A little sharply.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    And that interests me.  How
tt    someone who knows him so well
tt    could be so wrong.

tA formidable guy.  She meets his gaze.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    See, I love him, too, as much
tt    as anyone here.  And for a
tt    whole lot longer.

tFrom her heart.

</b>tt    I think I know best what would

<b>tINT.  TOILET STALL - DAY
</b>
tJulianne, fully dressed, sits on the closed lid of a toilet seat.
tThe stall is tiny enough to arouse claustrophobia in an astronaut.
tHer cellular phone pressed to her ear, she is listening angrily,
tsmoking ferociously, every call in her body running at red-line.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Okay, okay, okay, okay, I hear
tt    you, all right?

tShe closes her eyes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    It is stupid, dishonest, desperate
tt    beyond belief, and can't possibly
tt    ever work.  It can only end in
tt    humiliation and disgrace.  Now can

tDeep drag on the cigarette.  For strength.

<b>ttttJULIANNE

tShe's striped her gears.  COUGHS horribly.

tstaring at her.

<b>ttttTEENAGER
</b>ttt    (supportive)
tt    You do it, girl.

tJulianne nods to the kids.  They nod back.  Damn straight.  She
texits the restroom, into...

t... glaring sunlight.  We are in the middle of the BROOKFIELD ZOO.
tAnd sitting on a bench, eating popcorn from a bag...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Wow.  What was going on in
tt    there?

tShe shudders.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Some crazy person.

<b>tEXT.  ZOO - DAY
</b>
tMichael and Julianne walking together.  He's eating his popcorn.
tShe carries a cardboard container with nachos, a gooey fudge waffle
tcone, and a large drink.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    You're not eating.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I never eat when I'm serene.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    You never eat when you're
tt    despondent.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I switched that around when you
tt    weren't looking.

tShe swirls a single nacho chip in cheese.  But her heart isn't in it.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Last zoo we were in was...
tt    Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos
tt    were fucking.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Boy, those were the days.

tAnd when she looks over.  His eyes are waiting.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (softly)
tt    Yeah, they were.

tThey're passing the hippo pen.  But they don't notice.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    That was nice.  The way you
tt    said that.

tSo was that.  He's feeling restless, something.  Doesn't know quite
twhat to say.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    It's weird being the groom.  All
tt    these things Kimmy has to take
tt    care of...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You need a baby-sitter.  That's
tt    what I'm here for.

tHe holds her eyes.  Then looks down.  Awkward.  And the way he's
tdoing it begins to excite her.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Say it.

tHe looks up, neither one of them noticing that as they walk, she is
tabout to...

t... CRASH into a chest-high metal stand that displays animal facts.
tWe have followed him as she is WIPED from frame.  His face from
tshock... to amusement.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Now, there's my girl.

t... to tenderness.  PAN back to see her wearing everything from her
tcardboard container.  Nachos, fudge sauce, Diet Coke, the works.
tIt is really awful.  Kids, bystanders, laughing cruelly.  Her eyes
tfill with tears, and she tries bravely to smile against it...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    See, I can only do it with
tt    beer.

tHe takes out his handkerchief.  And with that and his hands, gently
tscoops the worst of the mess off her.  The fact that he's touching
ther breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice.
tShe laughs softly, and a few tears fall, even though she doesn't
tknow why.  Such an odd, raw, confusing moment.  To the world
tlooking on, they are lovers.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (murmurs)
tt    See, better already.

tAnd he kisses her face.  Not quite her lips.  But only an inch away.
tWe can feel her heart pounding.  He strips off his shirt, only a tank
ttop underneath.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    We'll go back to the bathroom,
tt    you'll put this on...

tOkay? She sniffles, okay.  Swallows.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Bet you're glad I'm here to
tt    take care of you.

tHe puts his arm around her.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Bet I am.

tHolds her close, as they start toward the restroom...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Hope that crazy person's not
tt    still there.

tWe're on their backs...

<b>ttttJULIANNE (O.S.)
</b>tt    She doesn't scare me.

<b>tEXT.  BEACH CLUB, LAKE MICHIGAN - SUNSET
</b>
tJulianne in T-shirt and shorts, rushes onto the deck of a sprawling
tbeach club.  Clutching her bag, she quickly surveys the scene...

t... the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party.
tYoung folks, old folks, little kids, maybe 200 people.  We SCAN
twith her to find a crowd around...

t... a three-on-three volleyball game.  Kimmy and two groomsmen on
tone side, facing Michael and the Tennessee debs.  The twins wear
tspectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic, as well as
tpredictably uninhabited.  As the next point begins, Kimmy serves...

t... Sammy in back makes a nice dig, lobbing to Mandy who sets for
tMichael's vicious SPIKE straight THROUGH his best man's hapless
tdefense.  The crowd cheers Michael, and as he turns, Mandy gives
thim a savage...

t... CHEST BUMP of congratulation, that any NFL linebacker would be
tproud of.  It puts the surprised Michael straight on his butt.
tLaughter, applause.  The twins pull him up and Sammy gives him a
thot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react.  Kim plays good
tsport.  Julianne watches Michael's body for a beat, then...

t... dashes off.  Down the beach, several barbecue grills have been
tset up.  Manned by beach club staff and family alike.  Michael's
tpop, Joe, is dispensing beers from a keg.  Kim's mom, Isabelle, is
tcoordinating the beans, potato salad and corn-on-the-cob table.
tJulianne races across the sand to...

t... a huge smoky grill where Walter is basting baby back ribs,
tclearly enjoying himself.  Julianne runs up to him, says something
tinto his ear.  He looks at her.  Then turns his station over to a
tclub steward, and follows Julianne down toward the lakeside.

tCLOSE now.  As they stroll together, she's a little breathless.
tHe's watching her profile, curious, silent.  At the water's edge...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>ttt    (whispers)
tt    Is anybody watching?

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    I hope so.  This is all too
tt    mysterious to waste on just me.

tShe reaches into her big bag.  Pulls out a single folded sheet of
tpaper.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I picked up Michael's messages
tt    for him, at our hotel.  I stole
tt    one...

tHis face darkens.  The easy smile fades.  He holds up his palms...

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    Julianne, reading my son-in-law's
tt    mail, is not something...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Sir, this is important! Haven't
tt    you ever in your life cut one
tt    corner, to make something important
tt    turn out right?

tHis smile returns.  Just a little.

<b>tttt WALTER
</b>tt    Matter of fact, that's how I got
tt    married.

tThe look holds.  She thrusts the paper out.  He still doesn't take
tit.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    It's a fax from Sports Illustrated
tt    from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt    (quickly)
tt    I know Ben.

tShe opens the paper.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    "Mike.  We still have no answer to
tt    our E-mail of Wednesday.  Which
tt    option do you select? I don't mean

tt    tie up the loose ends."

tHe takes the paper.  We see it now.  Looks authentic.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I think he's been fired.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    It doesn't say th...

tt    I came up with the idea of you

tHe looks up.  He's listening.  Closely.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    And why I couldn't say anything
tt    before in front of Kim.

tShe bites her lip.  Seems so earnest.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I just think of how... desperate
tt    he must be feeling.  He's marrying
tt    a rich man's daughter, and he's
tt    about to become destitute.  You
tt    know the kind of job market he'll
tt    be facing?

tHe does.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    And you think he's kept this to
tt    himself.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    He's too proud to beg for help.
tt    And if you wait till this comes out,
tt    your offer will be like charity.
tt    Completely humiliating.

tHe's staring at her.  But his mind is working behind his eyes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    If you do it now, it's like he's
tt    helping you.  He can accept with
tt    dignity.

tHe taps the paper with the back of his knuckles.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    This fax could mean... any number
tt    of things...

tShe nods.  She knows that.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt    (softly)
tt    Maybe.  I should call Ben.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Then it could all come out, sooner
tt    or later.  Nobody should be in on

tShe takes the paper back.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    What if, what if I could find
tt    that E-mail?

tThe long straight look.  Maybe he's hooked.

tShe's tramping through a bachelor's debris, wearing only her towel,
tlooking, looking...

tThere it is.  The corner of his LAPTOP sticking out from beneath a
tdiscarded bedspread.  She SNATCHES it up, OPENS it, sets it on the
tcluttered desk, and...

t... stops.  There are wallet-sized SNAPSHOTS of Kimmy.  Some alone.
tSome as a little girl.  Some with Michael.  And next to them...

t... the plastic fold-out wallet inset.  That he has not yet quite
trearranged.  So she picks it up.  Leafs through, until she finds
twhat she was praying would be there...

t... Julianne grinning.  Michael's arm around her.  On the deck of a
tboat.  They have drinks in their hands.  Happiness in their eyes.

tAnd she stares at it.  Jesus, God, how long has he carried this
taround?  She flips through further, all the rest have her in them.
tMaybe half a dozen.  Her heart is throbbing.  Her eyes are damp.

tBack to the one on the boat.  She slips it from the plastic window.

</b>tt    Sure you're okay?

tShe looks really scared.  Turns her drink in her hand.  Looking
tdown at it.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    It's not just a gag, huh?

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    No, it's, uh... a real big favor.

tHe takes her hand, tenderly.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I wish you'd just... come out
tt    with it.  I mean why are we
tt    waiting for Jules?

tShe smiles up at him.  The best she can.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    Moral support.

tShe loves him so much, and she is sick with worry.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    What's good of having a big
tt    sister, if she...

tStops.  Gestures with her eyes.  Because her big sister has just
tentered...

t... looking fabulous.  Julianne wears a long sleek sarong, slightly
tsee-through.  Her hair is bound up with silver pins.  As she moves
tthrough the room toward us, we can see that, for once, her make-up
tis flawless, understated.  When she arrives at the table...

t... Michael is beaming, admiringly.  He stands up.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (softly)
tt    Wow and wow.  You have a date,
tt    after this?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Never can tell.

tHe holds her chair.  She exchanges an intimate smile with the
tanxious Kim.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    You make me think of that song,

tAnd he starts humming.  The song is, "The Way You Look Tonight."

tThey sit.  He looks from Julianne to his bride.

tKim's eyes flick to Julianne, who nods, supportively.  The kid
ttakes a breath.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    It's really my father.  Who

</b>tt    He needs someone incredible,

tSo quiet.  So cold.  She is terrified.

</b>tt    It would only be, maybe, six

tA frozen, forever moment.  He steps to her...

t... LIFTS her up in his arms.  Into the deepest, most heartfelt

tREAR VIEW of Julianne asleep on the floor, sunlight streaming in.

tJulianne seated at the sink, staring into the mirror, as Digger
tgently applies soup, cloth and water to easing away the mask.  A
tpaleontologist restoring a Bronze Age artifact.  By the side of the
thalf-filled sink, rests her plugged-in curling iron.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    What I mean, when I say annoyingly

tCutting edge salon.  Loud, PULSING MUSIC.  Digger and Michael in
tadjacent chairs, heads back, each smoking impressive cigars as
ttheir hair is styled.  Digger's stylist is a hot trashy female.
tMichael's is a tall, flamboyant male in a day-glo vest.

tEach man has one hand soaking, the other being worked on by a
tmanicurist, so Julianne goes from one to the other, removing their
tcigars so they can exhale.  A seraglio feel to the way she does
tthis.

tNow she's arguing with Michael's stork-like stylist.  We can't hear
tover the music, but she keeps tugging on Michael's hair, pretty
tpassionate about her point of view.  Suddenly, she GRABS the

t... BOLTS out of the chair.  WHOA!

<b>tEXT.  O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
tSkycaps, guests of impatient travelers, a bus offloading forty
tJapanese tourists.  A taxi cuts off a van to reach the curb.  Out
tjumps...

tMichael.  Opening the door for Digger and Julianne.  Digger says
tsomething, Michael gives him a strong HUG.  Julianne raises one
tfinger to Michael, back in a second.  Leads Digger off by the hand.

tCLOSE on them now.  Alone in the throng.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Bye, handsome.

tDigger just stares at her.  Those maddening judgemental eyes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You're going to say it, aren't
tt    you?

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Tell him you love him.  With
tt    all your heart.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'm taking my next book to

<b>tttt DIGGER
</b>tt    Tell him you've loved him for

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'm moving this book to Viking.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Tell him you're afraid of love.
tt    Afraid of needing.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Needing.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    To belong to someone.

tHe touches her hair.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    We all do, beautiful.  I'm sorry
tt    about that.

tStaring in her eyes.  Even Julianne has run out of words.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    Tell him you know this is the
tt    worst, dumbest, cruelest moment
tt    to do this to him.  But there
tt    it is, and he has to choose.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    And what will he do?

tDigger isn't smiling.  His voice low, beneath the crowd...

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    He'll choose Kim.  You'll stand
tt    by her at her wedding.  You'll
tt    kiss him good-bye.  And you'll
tt    go home.

tHe holds up one finger.  Almost touching her nose.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>tt    This is what you've come to do.
tt    Now do it.

tWow.  She looks frightened and moved, all at the same time.  She
tkisses him on the lips.

tAnd walks away.  He watches her go through the crowd.  Take
tMichael's hand.  Lead him back toward the taxi.

<b>tEXT.  SKYLINE CRUISE BOAT - DAY

tThe skyline of Chicago moves past us.  Slowly.  The NBC Tower,
tCityfront Center...

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>tt    Big weddings are so strange.

<b>ttttJULIANNE (O.S.)

tUp ahead, the Wrigley Building draws closer...

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>tt    Kim has all this stuff to do,
tt    I hardly see her.

<b>ttttJULIANNE (O.S.)
</b>tt    Well, you've got the rest of
tt    your lives.

tREVERSE ANGLE... they lean on the rail of a cruise boat, easing down
tthe Chicago River.  Wind-blown.  Close together.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Getting your bed made.  Every
tt    day.

tThey smile at each other.  Seem so comfortable together.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You miss her, huh?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    No.  I've got you.

tShe nods.  That you have.  Staring in her eyes...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Don't you throw up on boat?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    If you like.

tAnd she LURCHES over the railing, emitting a BARRAGE of incredibly
tdisgusting sounds, her feet FLAILING in mid-air.  He laughs, as he
tpulls her back down to the deck.  Of course, it was all a joke.  He
tbrushes back her hair.  Sighs.  Stares.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I've been thinking a lot the
tt    last couple days.  About us,
tt    actually.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>ttt    (casual)
tt    Have you.

tHe has.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Well.  There's a lot of memories
tt    to choose from...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    It's more than that.

tThat tightens her throat pretty good.  When she tries to speak, out
tcomes a dry CROAK that makes him laugh again.  Softer, this time.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I mean, it's embarrassing to
tt    say it this way, but...

tHe stops.  Her eyes WIDEN in a burlesque of anticipation.  So he
tsmiles.  She knows how to put him at ease.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    You've sort of been... y'know,
tt    the woman in my life.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>ttt    (straight back)
tt    You've been the man in mine.

tPassing under the Michigan Avenue Bridge.  No one knows quite what
tto say.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    And I was thinking this could be
tt    our last time.  Alone.  Together.
tt    You know?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Except for the hot affairs we'll
tt    have twice a year.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Except for that.

tShe's smiling so easily.  Who would guess her stomach is double-
tknotted.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I can hardly wait for your

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Me either.

tShe watches his surprise.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Boy, I never thought I'd hear you
tt    say that.  Can I come?

tShe holds herself together.  Real soft with...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I couldn't have it without you.

tHe's glad to hear that.  And then...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    It's normal to have... second
tt    thoughts, huh? To be scared.

tIs this a change of direction? Or is it the direction she's been
tpraying for.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I wouldn't know.  I never had
tt    that many first thoughts.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I mean, you commit to a wedding.
tt    And then it seems like... this...
tt    momentum, you know?  You forget
tt    you... chose it.

tShe nods.  Understands.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    You and I.  I mean, in all our
tt    relationships with other people...
tt    We didn't use the word "love"
tt    a lot, did we?

tWe didn't.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Kimmy says.  When you love someone.
tt    You say it, you say it out loud.
tt    Right now.  Or the moment...

tLong beat.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    ... passes you by, yeah.  She's a
tt    smart girl.

tOff in distance, the Centennial Fountain SHOOTS an eight-foot JET
tof water across the river.  For Michael and Julianne it goes
tunnoticed.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    We don't have a song.

tHmm?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Kimmy and I.  We don't have a song.
tt    Is that a bad sign?

tAll Julianne can do is shrug.  Then...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (sings, softly)
tt    Someday, when I'm awfully low...
tt      And the world is cold...

tShe doesn't want to cry.  So she puts all the strength she has into
tfighting it back.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (sings)
tt    I will feel a glow just Thinking of you...
tt      And the way you look.  Tonight.

tHe stops.  Smiles that sweet, boyish smile.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Dance card filled?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'll check.  I have it on
tt    powerbook, these days.

tHe holds up his arms.  And she moves into them.  He begins to dance
twith her, turning so slowly.  And, yes, people are watching.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    t    (sings in her ear)
tt    With each word, your tenderness grows,

tShe holds him closer.  Bites her lip.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (sings)
tt    And that laugh
tt      That wrinkles your nose,
tt    Touches my foolish heart.

tHe stops.  He looks at her.  She's still in his arms.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Where did we first hear th...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt  t    (straight back)
tt    The night we met.

tRight to his eyes...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    The night we fell in love.

tHe doesn't know what to do with that.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    So we heard it... like, right
tt    that... that first...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    We danced to it.  Just like this.

tJust like this.  A long beat.  And he has to say...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I won't lose you, will I?

tHer eyes close.  Then open.  Utterly lost in his.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    No.  Because I won't let you.

<b>tINT.  WALLACE ENTERPRISES - DAY
</b>
tJulianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress
tshirt.  Her coat slung over her shoulder, she wanders through
tthe Saturday-deserted office space.  Desks, cubicles, monitors,
tsilent.  A row of executive offices standing empty, waiting for
tthe custodian.  Turning a corner, we hear...

t... life, at the end of the hallway.  A grand conference room with a
tglass wall.  Walter, in shirtsleeves, running a strategy meeting
tfor five.  DEIDRE, his personal secretary, clicking every word into
ther laptop at warp speed.  Walter sees Julianne through the glass.
tA comic take of pleased surprise.  He comes out to greet her...

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    I thought Michael was picking
tt    me up.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I told him, get the important

tJulianne thinks back.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Friction.  No.

tHe smiles at her line reading.  But his mind is always probing.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>tt    I haven't caused... a problem,

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Nobody has.  So far.

tt    Could I use... your office?

<b>tINT.  WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tJulianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city.
tCloses the door, quietly, behind her.  So anxious, she is
tpractically hyperventilating.  She goes, slowly to the vacant
tcherrywood desk.  Its computer and monitor standing silent.  She
tis stalking it, like a deadly animal.  And then.  She is there.

tTalking to herself, her own desperate support network...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>ttt    (softly)
tt    You can do this.

tSacred, filled with doubt and conflict.  Her hands clutch at each
tother.  Then, one flicks out.  And the computer goes ON.  The
tscreen GLOWS.  Waits for her.  Her mouth is sand, her stomach
twater.  She pulls the paper from her pocket...

t... looks at it.  Looks to the monitor.  And begins.  To type...

</b>ttt    (mumbling to herself)

tDoesn't look easy.  Licks her lips.

tShe glances to her huge bag.  Rummages through, pulling out a manila

tnatural, disorderly way.  Takes a step back...

<b>tINT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

<b>tINT.  CHAPEL, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - DAY
</b>
tJulianne and Walter enter the rear of a striking Gothic CHAPEL,
tpastel light slanting in through stained glass windows.  We now
tsee the full effect of her outfit, a man's-style chalk stripe SUIT,
ttailored to fit her body, set off by a bold silk tie.  Solid
tdynamite.  She hangs back, while Walter proceeds down the vaulted
tnave toward...

t... Michael, Kimmy, Isabelle and Joe, who stand casually joking by
tthe altar.  Scattered around are assorted groomsmen, ushers, an
tobvious flowergirl.  Coming toward us, up the aisle...

t... the MINISTER, early 40s, lean and quite attractive.  Mandy is
tHANGING on his arm, pressing her body against him as they walk,
tmurmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear.  He's a really good
tsport, and really uncomfortable.  Sammy is walking backwards,
tright in front of them, DROPS her bag, and BENDS to retrieve it, as
tif oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display.

tJulianne is so lost in her own anxiety, she doesn't even notice,
tuntil...

<b>ttttMANDY

tt    Kimberly's somewhat butch
tt    maid of honor...

<b>ttttSAMMY
</b>tt    ... Mr. Julianne Potter,
tt    prominent New York drag queen.

tToday, the girls' voices are charmingly musically Southern, with
tnone of the extreme accents we heard at the shower.  The minister
textends his hand...

<b>ttttMINISTER
</b>tt    Billy Dyer, Julianne.  And I
tt    love the suit.

tShe shakes his hand, smiles graciously, but her eyes flick to
tMichael, now approaching up the aisle.  The girls lead the minister
taway.  Michael arrives.  Looks her up and down.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (softly)
tt    Takes me back.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Well.

tShe smiles.  One that glows a little.

tHe nods.

<b>ttttMICHAEL

tOh, yeah?  Yes, ma'am.  As she loses herself in his eyes...

<b>ttttMICHAEL

<b>tINT.  CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT

tconversation from a rowdy, friendly joint.  Julianne's right hand
tREACHES to the bowl, fingers trace the rim innocently, then...

t... SLIDE the bowl into Julianne's lap beneath the table.  Her right
thand MASSAGES all the butter into a gooey revolving mess.  We can
tpick out familiar voices now, family in distance, the twins closer.
tAs, hidden from view, Julianne brings...

t... her left hand from her pocket.  Yep.  The ring is still there.
tThe finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it
toff.  And as APPLAUSE surrounds us, Julianne...

tPLUNGES her ring finger into the morass of grease, frantically
tTEARING at the ring, butter SPLURGING on her pants, everywhere, as
twe PULL BACK to see...

t... the long table covered with butcher paper, the family at the far
tend, the twins down here with us, a mug of beer for each place, as
tteam of waiters with heaping platters of CRABS, which they...

t... FLING across the butcher paper, as APPLAUSE continues from
teveryone but Julianne, who still struggles secretly.  As the waiters
tset huge wooden MALLETS in front of each guest, Joe O'Neal rises,
tPOUNDS the table with his mallet for attention.

<b>ttttJOE

</b>tt    Okay, everyone stand up!

tAnd everyone does.  With one exception.  Trapped.  She JAMS her

ton the underside of the table, GRABS her mallet and JUMPS UP.

<b>ttttJOE
</b>tt    To the bride, uh, goes the
tt    honor... of cracking the first

tEveryone applauses by banging their mallets.  Joe RAISES his high.
tEverybody imitates.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    But first, a toast!

tAnd everybody SNATCHES up their beers with their left hands, as
tJulianne DROPS her mallet with a HORRIFIC CRASH, grabbing her beer,
tlooking up to...

tt    I'm right-handed.

tA hugely embarrassing half-second.  Bailed out by...

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    Who taught me to play "Blue

tWith a look at Julianne, Kim sets down her mallet gently, and
tperforms a nasal HUM of the tropical standard, strikingly her nostril
trepeatedly for vibrato.  It is charming, and everybody watches.

t... and overdecorated BALLROOM, in dim and dramatic lighting,
tdripping with the trappings of ANCIENT ROME.  The mingling guests
tare the neatly one hundred females of the wedding party, most of

tin Roman togas or gladiator costumes.  PAN TO...

twrapped around their bodies.

tOh.

</b>tt    Well, I'm worried about something.

tSomething.  Their expressions are deliciously, identically
texpectant.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Oh.  I left this really important

tSome...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    ... figures.  On territorial sales.
tt    To close my book deal.

tUh-huh...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    So Kim gave me the key.  And

<b>ttttSAMMY

tJulianne blinks.  Ring...?

<b>ttttMANDY
</b>tt    The one you better get the fuck
tt    off your third finger left hand.

tAh.  That ring.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Well.  See.  That was a...
tt    reflex to see if it would...

<b>ttttMANDY
</b>ttt    (helpful)
tt    ... look good on Kimberly.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Right.  And then it didn't want
tt    to come off.  Exactly.

<b>ttttSAMMY
</b>tt    Maybe it's happy there.

<b>ttttMANDY
</b>tt    Oh the way out of the crab house?
tt    We asked Michael if we could see
tt    the ring?

<b>ttttSAMMY
</b>tt    He said you told him.  It'd be
tt    safer with you.

<b>ttttMANDY

tt    Let's get to work.

tANGLES... and industrial-sized jar of peanut butter.  Julianne's hand
tPLUNGES in, halfway to the rolled-up sleeve at her elbow.  SMOOCHES
tit around, real good.  PULL BACK to reveal...

t... she is surrounded by the twins and six guys, all SHOUTING

tTugs for all she's worth...

<b>ttttEIGHT PEOPLE

tout...

t... a spray can of WD-40.  Instantly, her hand is BLACK.  The guy TUGS.
tNo movement.  He can't believe it.

tEverybody turns.  The little girl in the doorway.  Southern accent...

<b>ttttFLOWER GIRL

tEverything gets real quiet.  Mandy takes charge.  She rolls down
tJulianne's left sleeve, RIPS the hem out of the cuff, so that it
tflaps down over her hand, covering the ring.  Sammy wipes the black
tstuff from Julianne's fingers.

<b>ttttMANDY
</b>tt    Don't worry, baby.  You could

tTouches her hair.

<b>tINT.  LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON - NIGHT
</b>
tMichael and a disconsolate Julianne board the elevator.  He presses
t15, she pushes 11.  Michael carries a handful of messages slips and
tan envelope.  As the car starts up, she folds her arms across her
tchest, at the edge of tears.  He doesn't know what to do.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (gently)

tHe's really concerned, can't bear to see her so upset.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (softly)
tt    Jules?

tShe won't look at him.  She wants to die.  The bell RINGS, the doors
topen to her floor.  She just walks out.

tAnd he follows.  They stand now, she with her arms crossed, lip
ttrembling.  She can't believe how close she is to losing it.

tShe THROWS her arms around his, HUGGING him so hard, so close.  He
tlaughs, she is so weird.  She pulls back, beaming, glowing.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Come on, we'll call from your

tShe claps his hand.  As they head down the hall...

<b>ttttMICHAEL

tHe's trying to flip through the message slips in his free hand...

<b>ttttMICHAEL

tToward the phone.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Jules.  Could you give me a
tt    minute?

tHe looks more sick than angry.  As if the heart has just been cut
tout of him.  She doesn't know what to say or do, so she just stands,
tstaring dumbly.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Please?

tShe nods, stumbles out of her room, closing the door behind her.
tNow she's in the empty corridor, clutching her big jumbled bag,
tsinking down to sit on the carpet, her back against the door.

tShe doesn't look elated.  She seems frightened, distraught, and
tmost of all, confused.  Because she can't understand why.  She digs
tabsently through her bag.  Cigarettes.  Box of matches.

tShe lights up.  Draws deeply.  Somehow, she seems near tears, and
tlaughs bitterly at that.  Shakes her head at how fucked-up she finds
therself.  Squeaking wheels approach, but she is too lost to hear them.

<b>ttttBELLMAN
</b>tt    Miss, are you locked out,

tbut neatly-kept uniform.  On his cart, a ton of bags.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    No, I just stepped out, because...
tt    it's a non-smoking room.

tAnd inhales deeply.  Leans back against the door, to look up at him
tmore comfortably.

<b>ttttBELLMAN
</b>ttt    (politely)

tt    Why don't you have me arrested?

tThat wasn't sarcastic.  He doesn't know what to say.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I mean that.  Arrested, convicted,
tt    put in solitary.

tAnother puff.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    See, I'm a dangerous, criminal
tt    person.  I do bad things to

tt    smoking?  Tip of the iceberg.

tWaves her hand.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Make a citizen's arrest, I won't
tt    struggle.  It'll be like getting
tt    Al Capone on tax evasion.

tNow she seems angry.  But not at him.  Her eyes fill with tears.

<b>ttttBELLMAN
</b>tt    Can I... Can I help you, miss?

tShe squints at his nameplate.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Do you smoke, Richard?

<b>ttttBELLMAN
</b>tt    Yes, ma'am, I do, but it's...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    ... a non-smoking floor, yeah.
tt    Well, you know what?

tAnd she takes the cigarette from her lips.  Turns it around, holds
tit out to him.  Go ahead.  He doesn't move.  Please! And so...

t... he reaches down, takes the cigarette from her hand.  Staring in
ther eyes, he takes a deep drag.  Savors an expert nostril-inhale of
this exhaled smoke.  Hands the cigarette back to her...

<b>ttttBELLMAN
</b>tt    My grandmother always said,
tt    "This, too, shall pass."

tShe swallows.  Wipes at her eyes.  Finds a smile.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Thanks, Richard.  If you weren't
tt    on duty, I'd buy you a drink.

tHe just nods.  She waves.  He waves back, pushes his cart down the
thall.  As she watches him go, the door behind her suddenly OPENS,
tand she...

t... FALLS through it, flat on her back at Michael's feet.  Staring up
tat him, seeing that he looks as bad as she feels, she takes raw, deep
tdrag.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    What happened?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (softly)
tt    It's over.

tAnd crouches down.  Close beside her.  The cigarette drops from her
thand, unnoticed on the carpet.  So he lifts it, crushes it on the
theel of his shoe.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I want you to quit this shit,
tt    it'll kill you.

tShe just nods, obediently.  Okay, I will.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    She denied it.  Said I was crazy
tt    and paranoid.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    A bad combination.

tHe tries to smile.  It's really hard.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    There's this big brunch tomorrow
tt    morning?  At her place.

tHe lets the air out.  Slow.  So he won't cry.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    She said "How can I call everything
tt    off, what do I tell everybody?"

tShakes his head.  Can you imagine that?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Michael...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    No, it's for the best, it really
tt    is.  We were so wrong for each
tt    other.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    The job thing would have broken
tt    us up, eventually, anyway.  She
tt    couldn't have lived with it.  I
tt    know that now.

tJulianne nods.  Maybe that part is right.  Maybe it would have
tended anyway.  Maybe she can pretend she's not a monster.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt     And she's right, I'm crazy to
tt     fall for someone.  I hardly
tt     knew.

tLooks deep in her eyes.  He's so glad she's there.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Hey.  You still got that ring?

tShe holds up her left hand, the flapping sleeve falls away.  The
tring is on a finger that is swollen and raw.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I tried it on.  But it won't
tt    come off.

tHe smiles at that.  A sad smile of friendship.  Then takes her
tfinger gently...

t... into his mouth.  It is something like a kiss.  And when he
tremoves her moistened finger...

t... he pulls the ring OFF.  Nothing to it.  She blinks.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    It's mental, you know.

tHe doesn't understand that.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Should we take a walk?  Or
tt    maybe some food sent up, or
tt    something...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I just want to be alone.  Is
tt    that okay?

tShe nods, sure.  He kisses her cheek.  Stands up.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Maybe I'll go back to New York.
tt    Hang with you for awhile, huh?
tt    Ben'll understand.

tShe nods again.  Whatever you say.  He steps into the open doorway...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Or we'll go somewhere.  If you
tt    have the time.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    If San Antonio sweeps
tt    Sacramento...

tThey smiles at each other.  For real.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I've never been to Texas.

tImagine that.  The look holds.  Just above a whisper...

tAnd then he's gone.

<b>tINT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

tJulianne sprawled all over the bed, mouth open like a carp,
tsleeping mask against the daylight.  A sudden RAPPING at the
tdoor, and she...

t... sits BOLT UPRIGHT.  Utterly disoriented, until she pulls off
tthe mask.  Stumbles out of bed, walking toward the firm KNOCKING,
twhen...

t... it stops.  A message slip SLIDES beneath her door.  She lifts
tit, barely conscious.  This wakes her up.  In one.

<b>ttttJULIANNE

tt    You're going where?

<b>tEXT.  WALLACE ESTATE - DAY
</b>
tJulianne climbs from her taxi.  Only slightly in awe, she sets off
tpast the reflecting pool, which fronts a mansion of graceful stone
tand timber.  It's a hike today, because the circular drives is
tclogged deep with Bentleys, Mercedes, and waiting limos, vying for
tspace with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds, maintenance
ttrucks, catering and florist and food vans.

<b>tINT.  GREAT ROOM - DAY
</b>
tJulianne escorted into an enormous room, where brunch is in
tprogress for more than a hundred.  She looks from the vaulted
tceilings, to the frescoed walls, the inlaid floors, the massive
tpipe organ above the stone staircase, the oil portraits of Scottish
tancestors and their favorite dogs.

tIsabelle has risen from the main table, and comes to her.  All

tlaughing about?  Do they still think there's a wedding?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    She looks tense.

<b>ttttISABELLE
</b>ttt    (O.S., calmly)
tt    Nerves.  I would never have
tt    guessed.

<b>tEXT.  ROSE GARDEN - DAAY
</b>
tA steward leads Julianne to the edge of an expansive rose garden,
taltogether elegant and comfortable with its long white picnic
ttables, where nearly a hundred guests casually dine, served by
trolling carts.

tThere, at the head table, Michael staring at us.  He looks like a
tpoor attempt to cover a hard night.  She locks onto his eyes.  What
tthe hell is going on? He looks helpless, miserable.  She gestures
twith her head, follow me.  Stalks off.

<b>tEXT.  SCULPTURE GARDEN - DAY
</b>
tBronze abstract pieces, some quite large, face a huge set of
tchildren's swings, regulation playground size.  Julianne sits in
tone, moving slightly back and forth.  Trying to hold on to her
ttemper and her sanity.

tIn the distance, trucks are winding their way to and from the pond,
twhere crews are setting up tents, lights, heaters for tonight.  The
tcircus has come to town.  When she looks back...

tMichael approaches.  Before he can draw a breath...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I had the craziest dream last
tt    night?  Walter and Kimmy had
tt    asked your boss to...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Look, I came down here to face
tt    everybody.  I didn't want to
tt    slink away like some coward...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    But the Scotch salmon was so
tt    fucking good, you decided to
tt    stay for brunch!

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    She hasn't told anybody, what
tt    am I supposed to do?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Get married, apparently.

tShe comes OFF the swing, PUSHES him back two feet.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    What the hell are you thinking
tt    of, the goddamn wedding is SIX
<b>tt    O'CLOCK!!
</b>
tHe swallows hard.  Trapped.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    This is her family and her
tt    fault.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    And your point?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (ten years old)
tt    Well.  How come she didn't...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS
</b><b>tt    YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR
</b><b>tt    EACH OTHER.
</b>
tHe just blinks.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Hey.  This is a serious matter.

tThank you.  She POKES his chest, punctuating...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'll be right back.

<b>tINT.  KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
tA modern take on the Medieval castle kitchen, towering ceilings,
tdark wood, copper pots hanging, a series of walk-in coolers and
tfreezers.  The place is a madhouse of activity, as prep cooks
tslice, chop, sort, every kind of food imaginable, and delivery
tteams bring more.

tThe girls walk through.  Alone together in the eye of the
thurricane.  Kim choked with excess sentiment...

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    Look at all this beautiful food,
tt    so lovingly prepared...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    They'll eat it anyway, you ever
tt    been to a walk?

tKimmy's lip trembles.  This is not how she thought of her wedding.
tThe din is so horrific, Kimmy leads them into a walk-in meat
tlocker.  Even here, two BUTCHERS are dressing Eastern-fresh corn-
tfed carcasses.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You guys want to give us a
tt    minute?

tThe men blink at each other.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    We'd like to be alone with
tt    our pork.

tOn that basis.  They leave.  Kimmy sits on a stack of packaged
tfrozen fowl parts.  Stares up with big, sweet, wet eyes.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    How's he doing?

tJulianne cannot believe this.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Who?  The jerk who's running
tt    your life?

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    This must be... very, very,
tt    hard on him.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    What with the psychosis and
tt    all, yeah.

tLeans in.  Listen...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    When are you gonna come clean
tt    with your folks?

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    Don't you see...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    If you're waiting for "Do you
tt    take this man?", that's
tt    considered poor form.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    ... that this is all my fault?

tStops Julianne cold.  Your fault.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    Whatever delusions I drove him to,
tt    there is truth at the heart of it.
tt    I want him to work for my father.
tt    I want to stay in school.  I want
tt    a life of my own!

tHarder and harder for Julianne to push.  Her mouth is dry.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Yeah, well, lots of couples are
tt    imcompat...

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    I love him.

tFragile and strong at once.  A plea.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    Tell him it's my fault and
tt    that I love him.

tA long beat.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'll be right back.

<b>tEXT.  TENNIS COURT - DAY
</b>
tThe court has become a giant holding pen for tonight's BALLOONS.
tThere are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all
tdirections, under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread
tacross the top of the court's chain-link fence.

tMichael stands outside the court, clutching the chain link like a
tprisoner, as Julianne comes through the gate.  From somewhere, we
thear high, squeaky, alien voice-like SOUNDS.  Incongruous
tagainst...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    How is she?

tJulianne absorbs this.  As the bizarre SOUNDS continue, she WHIRLS
taround...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    KNOCK IT OFF!!!
</b>
tWe now see three STONER COLLEGE GUYS, who have been filling the
tendless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court.
tClearly, they've been inhaling their working materials.

<b>tttt  STONER KID
</b>ttt    (Minnie Mouse)
<b>tt    YES, SIR!
</b>
tA Nazi salute.  When she turns back...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I asked you...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    She admits it's her fault.

tHe absorbs that.  And then...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Do you think she still loves
tt    me?

tWe watch the struggle inside her.  Her voice drops...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Sure, she does.  She's crazy
tt    about you.

tNow tears stand in both their eyes.  The stoners are doing their
tAlvin and the Chipmuks impersonation festival in the B.G., singing
tin castrato harmony.  But our two don't notice.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I keep asking, how can I explain
tt    what happened? And I keep
tt    getting that same answer all
tt    night long.

tWhich is...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I can't.  And it doesn't matter.
tt    I drove her to it, because I
tt    want things my way.  And even
tt    if she did something tricky and
tt    unfair... she was blinded by
tt    love, okay?

tJulianne swallows.  For obvious reasons.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Does that make it right...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Love doesn't have to be right.
tt    It just has to be love.

tThe stoner are now helium-crooning "Bridge Over Troubled Waters."
tActually, they're getting better.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    She's giving up half her life
tt    for me, and I'm bitching because
tt    it hurts her.

<b>ttttSTONERS
</b>ttt    (singing)
tt    Sail on silver girl
tt       Sail on by...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    She's a saint!  And I'm a
tt    worthless ingrate!

<b>ttttSTONERS
</b>ttt    (singing)
tt    Your time has come to shine,
tt       All your dreams are on their way...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Tell her.  I'll marry her at six
tt    o'clock, if she'll still have me.

tThe stoners blend on the high note.  It's pretty moving.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'll be right back.

<b>tINT.  ORGAN LOFT - DAY
</b>
tPAN along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents.  Nearly
ttwelve feet high, the pile curves along the balcony, high above the
tdiners in the Great Room, extending al the way to...

t... an organ loft.  Alone, above the noise of the party, Julianne
tand Kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase.  Trapped
tbetween ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth
torgan.  Dwarfed by their surroundings, Kimmy draws the hardest
tbreath of her life...

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>ttt    (whispers)
tt    So.  What did he say?

tJulianne's eyes move over the young girl's face.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    He said.  Marry me.

tKimmy YELPS in her ecstasy, FLINGING herself against Julianne, and
tthey go DOWN full length across the organ's pedals, BLASTING the
troom with a MONSTER CHORD of china-rattling volume and horrifying
tdisharmony.

tAs grown men and women SCREAM in spontaneous terror below, Kimmy
tbegins to...

t... LAUGH.  And KISS and hug her new sister.  And holds her tight.

<b>tEXT.  WILLOW POND - DAY
</b>
tJulianne and Michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking
tPOND, ringed with WILLOWS that dig heavy branches to the water's
tsurface.  He is relieved, reflective.  Head down, he never notices
tthat she is...

t... dangerously freaked.  Too petrified even to hyperventilate,
twe're lucky she's breathing at all.  We watch her life unraveling
tbefore her glassy eyes.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (never looks up)
tt    Thank God you were here.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>ttt    (mumbles to herself)
tt    Oh, yeah.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I was so confused, so conflicted,
tt    so... unstable.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Well, it happens.

tThey pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking
tarea.  Family vehicles, delivery trucks, service vans.  Everything
tthat couldn't fit on the circular front driveway.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I might have thrown away...

tSearching for the right words.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    ... your one chance for true
tt    happiness?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    ... yeah, that.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You never want to do that, see,
tt    that's always a... costly
tt    turnover.  As they say in the
tt    sport biz.

tThere's a vague Stepford Wife quality to her voice.  He hears that
tnow, and looks at her.  Maybe he can't tell she's frightened.  But
the can tell she's something.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (softly)
tt    Are you okay?

tShe stops walking.  She can't look at him, so she looks around.
tAcross the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly-
tcolored tents, unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and
tchairs, raising the poles between which all those balloons will be
tstrung.  At the center of it all...

t.... a huge topiary White Sox batter, just completing a murderous
tswing.  He's maybe fifteen feet tall.  She points to it...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    The Big Hurt, huh?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the
tt    past.  And he likes the little
tt    guys.

tSo Julianne nods.  Because she does too.  Squints up at Michael.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Got a minute?

tHe nods, you bet.  Worried for her.  What is this? She looks in
tanother direction, and we now see that we have nearly reached...

t... a stage that's been set up for the band.  Chairs, music stands,
tsound equipment.  A gleaming dance floor, already in place over the
tlawn.  Next to it, a shimmering white GAZEBO.  Like the centerpiece
tof a wedding cake.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Why is the dance floor by the
tt    gazebo?

tShe takes his hand.  They walk toward it.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Kimmy's idea.  She thought it
tt    would be such a romantic place.
tt    For our wedding dance.

tLooking down at her.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    What's up?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Shhh.

tUp the white steps now.  Together.  The gazebo floor has been
tcovered with hardwood.  The perfect place.  For a wedding dance.
tAnd Julianne...

t... turns, suddenly.  He almost runs into her.  She is staring up
tat him, so strangely, their bodies only inches apart.  He is caught,
ttransfixed by the intensity in her eyes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I have to say this quick, okay,
tt    or I'll have this massive
tt    coronary and you'll never have
tt    to hear it.  Which you need to.
tt    Does that make any sense at all?

tThe coronary part does.  We can feel her heart beating from here.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Jules, what's wrong...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    This is the dumbest thing I will
tt    ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that
tt    I can't.  I don't think.

tAnd then, she does.  She puts her hands flat on his chest.  Looks
tin his eyes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Michael, I love you.

tA heartbeat passes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I've loved you for nine years,
tt    but I was too arrogant and
tt    scared to realize it.  Now I'm
tt    just scared.

tHe stares at her, dumbstruck.  She moves even closer.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I know this comes at an
tt    inopportune time, but I have to
tt    ask this one really gigantic
tt    favor, okay?

tHolds her breath.  And...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Choose me.  Marry me.  Let me
tt    make you happy.

tAnd in a half beat of excruciating silence...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I know.  It sounds like three
tt    favors.

tHis eyes are loving.  They care for her.  She swallows, lost in
tthem.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    But when you think about it...

tSlides her arms around his neck, and raises her mouth...

t... to his.  The most beautiful kiss she will ever offer.  All of
ther heart is in this, and as his hands touch her body...

t... a SCREAM rips the world to pieces.  They whirl to see...

t... KIMMY, halfway up the path.  Her hands across her mouth, as if
tto stem the horror that pours forth as she SHRIEKS from her soul,
tand...

t... runs.  Back Down the path.  Michael BOLTING after her, SHOUTING
ther name.  A frozen moment, and...

t... Julianne TAKES OFF after him.  All three running, SCREAMING
ttheir various emotions at the top of their lungs, as workmen stop
tto watch from neighboring countries.

tKimmy, staring from halfway there, has an insurmountable lead.
tLEAPS into her convertible and PEELS OUT, just TEARING up the
tgravel as she ROCKETS out of sight.  No way to catch her.  Still...

t... Michael is racing for the cars.  Julianne, sprinting her guts
tout, losing ground with every stride.  Michael JUMPS into a
tCherokee...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    MICHAEL, DON'T, YOU'LL NEVER
</b><b>tt    CATCH HER!!
</b>
tHe GRINDS the gears.  She keeps RUNNING.  His engine FIRES.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    SHE HAS TOO BIG A LEAD AND SHE
</b><b>tt    DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL!!!
</b>
tHe BLASTS OFF.  She keeps going.  Gasping for air, clutching her side,
tshe's dying here.  Slams into a florist's truck, looks inside, shit!
tNext, a butcher's van, looks inside, Jesus!

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>ttt    (to the world at large)
<b>tt    DOESN'T ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS
</b><b>tt    ANYMORE?  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO
</b><b>tt    TRUST??
</b>
tUp ahead, Michael has STALLED the Cherokee.  She still has a chance,
tDASHES to the next van.  BORNSTEIN EXTERMINATION, a handsome
trendering of a rat above the TOXIC MATERIALS warning FLINGS the
tdoor open.  Stumbles in.  Keys!

<b>ttttJULIANNE (O.S.)
</b><b>tt    THANK GOD, A SAMARITAN!!
</b>
tMichael SPEEDS away.  She KICKS the ratmobile in gear.

tLURCHES off.

<b>tINT.  RATMOBILE, DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - DAY
</b>
tJulianne tearing through traffic, desperately struggling to keep
tMichael's Cherokee in view, while she shrieks into her cellular...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    IT IS NOT GOING WELL!
</b>
tDown the block, Michael WHIPS around a corner.  We follow suit to see
this destination dead ahead.  Union Station.  The DISPATCHER RADIO
tintrudes...

<b>ttttDISPATCHER (O.S.)
</b>tt    Uh, Unit Four Baker Charlie,
tt    how we cookin' on that Skokiie
tt    infestation?

tNow she's steering the car, tearing at the radio controls, and

<b>ttttFIELD MAN (O.S.)
</b>tt    Uh, what happens if you got
tt    that methyl-ethyl shit on
tt    your hands?

tMichael RIPS into the train station's parking lot.  We SWERVE
taround a taxi, CUT OFF Harley, CAREEN into the lot...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    GETTING WHAT YOU DESERVE IS
</b><b>tt    NOT FAIR!
</b>
<b>ttttDISPATCHER (O.S.)
</b>tt    Uh, you got maybe thirty seconds
tt    before you're sterile.  For God's
tt    sake don't touch yourself, or
tt    anything.

tUp ahead, Michael is OUT of his jeep and running.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    AND I HATE TALKING TO YOUR
</b><b>tt    MACHINE!
</b>
tShe SLAMS on the brakes, THROWING herself against the wheel.

<b>ttttYOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)
</b>tt    Uh, this is One Monkey Zebra.
tt    It wasn't bees in the gal's
tt    wall, it was cats!

<b>ttttYOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)
</b>tt    She says gas 'em, anyway,
tt    she'll pay cash.  Uh... how
tt    do I pay this?

tWITH Julianne now, RACING through the lot, Michael vanishes INTO
tthe Station, she PLUNGES in after him, BOUNCING off bystanders,
tapologizing, lunging on, gasping for breath, past exhaustion,
tthreatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk,
tcatching a lucky glimpse as he heads...

t... DOWN a staircase to the TRACKS.  My God, what's he doing?  A
tsecond wind, fueled by panic, and she BOLTS after him, DANCING down
tthe steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the
tconcourse to see him, running for...

t... Track 29, a train already RUMBLING, ready to pull out, she
tSPRINTS after him.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    MICHAEL!!
</b>
tHe DISAPPEARS behind the train, she FALLS, skids, springs up,
tpushes through gaping onlookers, almost there, the train PULLS
<b>tAWAY...
</b>
<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    NNNOOOO!!!
</b>
tBut he's just standing there.  His back to us.  Watching it go.

tHer body nearly collapses with relief.  She pushes herself on, but
ther legs aren't working right in their maxed-out fatigue, and she
tlopes and staggers until she comes up behind him.  He's still lost
tin thought, staring after the train.

tShe tries to speak, but there's no breath.  So she puts her hands
ton her knees and just GASPS for air like a dog.  Wheezing, panting,
ttrying once more to speak, but she can't yet, and then he casually
tturns and...

t... JUMPS out of his skin!  A heart attack seeing her.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>ttt    (croaks)
tt    Don't speak!

tHe just blinks at this sweaty, ripped-up, maniacal figure.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b><b>tt    DON'T SPEAK!

tFLINGING both her hands across his mouth.  A frozen beat.  He nods,

thim smile, in spite of everything.  At least she's done that.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I have to make a confession.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I've done nothing but slimy,

tTears in her own eyes now.  Big ones.

<b>ttttJULIANNE

tt    Like you said.

tShaking her head...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    But that doesn't excuse any

tNo...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    So you have to marry Kim.
tt    Because she will actually make
tt    you happy.  I, in contrast, am
tt    a shallow, neurotic psychopath,
tt    with relatively little to offer.

tOkay?

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Kim.  Nod your head.  Do as
tt    you're told.

tHe nods his head, still smiling.  Her tears are running now.  Maybe
tshe doesn't notice.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Just promise you'll never tell
tt    me who you would have chosen.
tt    If I hadn't confessed.

tShe chokes back a sob.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Cos if you would have chosen me.
tt    Then I threw away a perfectly
tt    good life.  Just to be a decent
tt    person.  Which is a questionable
tt    trade-off.  Right?

tHe nods, slowly.  Because he's supposed to.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    And if you would have chosen
tt    some 20-year-old punk over me.
tt    I'd have to kill myself.

tAh.  His smile keeps getting smaller.  More loving.  More wonderful.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (whispers)
tt    I'll take it to my grave.

tGood.  She looks around.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'm so glad you didn't jump on
tt    that train, before...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I came here, looking for her.

tFor her.  The words leave a silence.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Why would she come here...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    This is where I proposed.

tStares deep in her eyes.  She needs to hear this.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I had to cover a game in
tt    Milwaukee.  She saw me off.
tt    And when the train started to
tt    leave... I jumped up on the
tt    step, I help the handle, and
tt    without...

tHe grins.  Has to admit...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    ... without a thought in my head.
tt    I shouted, "Marry me."

tI did.  Now her eyes tear up again.  And she doesn't know why.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    And she gasped, and covered her
tt    mouth, and the train was pulling
tt    out, and suddenly she screamed
tt    YES!  Just once.  And blew me a
tt    kiss.

tWhat a girl.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I never forgot that.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    It's two weeks.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Almost three.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    That is so romantic.

tWhich makes him reach and touch her hair.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I just wonder if you know why.

tDo you?

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    It's because romance isn't
tt    mystery, and tricks, and doubts,
tt    and halting, unspoken longings.
tt    That's not the real romance.

tTears in his eyes now.  First time.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    The real romance is saying yes.

tDoes she know that now?  He looks at his watch.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>ttt    (sighs)

tOh.  That.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>ttt    (urgently)
tt    You can't believe you've lost
tt    her!  Sooner or later, you'll
tt    find her, and you'll look in
tt    each other's eyes, and you'll
tt    see all that love...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Course, if it's later rather

tt    at six o'clock.
ttt     (beat)
tt    You've got a lot of explaining
tt    to...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    I'm just thinking of how she's

tt    her life is over.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    That's little egotistical.

tHe glares at her.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    But, undoubtedly accurate.

tShe claps her hands, galvanized by the emergency.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Okay, we'll split up.  You go
tt    to every romantic place you
tt    guys have, I'll go... someplace
tt    brilliant, and the first one
tt    who...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    If you find her...

tStrange tone.  A gentle warning.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    The kiss.  May be hard.  For
tt    you to explain.
ttt    (beat)
tt    Because the only fear she
tt    really has, is...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    ... me, yeah.  And she likes
tt    Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.

tLooks at her own watch.  Shit!

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    But if you do get to her first...

tShe looks up.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    There is something you are

twedding.  The box is empty except for one cardboard container of
tnachos, extra cheese, sitting alone before a pulled-back chair.

tWhat she sees, prompts a sad warning...

tThe world gets real quiet.  An entire bathroom is listening.
tJulianne cocks her head to one side.

<b>tEXT.  UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - TWILIGHT

tEverybody nods.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Out of our way.

<b>tEXT.  DRESSING ROOM - TWILIGHT
</b>
tWhite.  Pure blinding white.  Across FRAME floats more white, this
tgauzy and ethereal.  It settles, its roots planting deeply in the
tbride's hair.  TILTS UP to...

t... the face of the woman who placed it there.  Julianne's eyes,
tappraising this bride we cannot see.  And so softly...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    Don't worry, sugar.

tDon't worry.

<b>ttttJULIANNE

tt    before.

tPAN DOWN the white until we are...

tCLOSE on the bride's perfect slippers.  HOLD.  And...

<b>tINT.  CHAPEL - EVENING
</b>
tBegins to slowly PAN BACK UP the length of an exquisite gown.  We
tcan tell from the organ, the nearby thrum of expectant voices, that
twe are nearing the moment.  We reach...

t... Kimmy's hand.  Firmly clasping Walter's.  Keep PANNING, the
tbodice, the lace, her throat, and finally, we are CLOSE on...

t... the face of the bride.  Now we understand the word radiant.  We
talso understand scared senseless.  Our perfect, unflappable Kimmy
tis in a trance of emotional overload where bliss and panic
tseamlessly blend.

tThe organ's noddling stops.  Kimmy's eyes alerted, like a small
tanimal bearing a predator approach her thicket.  Suddenly, the
tCHORD.  The Wedding March from Wagner's Lohengrin.  Here.  Comes.
tThe bride.  And we SNAP TO...

tFULL ANGLE... Kim and Walter.  This is it.

<b>ttttWALTER
</b>ttt    (whispers)

tREVERSE ANGLE... Kim's POV, the chapel, every pew packed, every neck
tcraning this way, the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to
twhere...

tMichael waits.  Also in a zone of pseudo-consciousness.  From which
the attempts a smile.  Not comforting.  Kim's POV WHIP PAN the
tgroomsmen, the twins, LOCKING FOCUS on Julianne, standing strong
tand beautiful, a glow of her own in the daffodil dress.  She sends
ther little sister a WINK across the trackless miles of aisle.  You
tcan do this, kid.  So...

t... Kimmy does.  On her father's arm, she walks the gauntlet of the
tworld's intrusive admiration.  One step at a time.  The most beautiful
tshe will ever be.  She is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw
tup at the same time.

tAnd she's there.  At his side.  She glances back to her maid of
thonor, just to make sure she's not working without a net.  So
tJulianne...

t... CROSSES her eyes.  Which lets the kid smile and finally take a
tbreath.  Have a little fun, huh? Kim nods, got it, turns to...

tThe Minister.  Who stands before them with a calming presence.
tThank God someone has done this before.  The crowd has hushed.
tThe Minister's eyes are only for two.  His words are for all...

<b>ttttMINISTER
</b>tt    Michael and Kimmy wrote these
tt    words.  She asked me to confide,
tt    mostly Michael.

tA ripple of laughter.  Gentle and fine.  They are setting in.

<b>ttttMINISTER
</b>tt    So he gets to say them.

tA surprise.  A pleasant one.  The crowd adjust in its seats.  As
tMichael begins...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Why do people get married
tt    anymore?

tAnd on these words.  We SNAP to Julianne.  Share her interest in
tthe bluntness, the simplicity, the unorthodoxy of this beginning.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>tt    Why not live together amicably,
tt    with no sense of obligation
tt    beyond the moment?

tHer eyes.  She's listening.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>tt    As long as the sex is good.  As
tt    long as no one more interesting
tt    has wandered into view.  As long
tt    as the thousand conflicts of two

tt    comfortably compromised.

tPANNING now.  Other faces.  Isabelle.  Proud to the bone.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>tt    And when one feels the urge to
tt    move on, to explore the new.
tt    No guilt, no disgrace, no
tt    promise broken.

tWalter.  His eyes damp.  Against our expectation.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>tt    No agony of having dishonored
tt    a time.  When our hearts.  And
tt    the world were different.

tJoe nods, as he hears...

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>tt    Marriage is a lot to put up
tt    with.

tJulianne once more.  No breath.  Rapt.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>tt    The answer must be.  That there
tt    is some need basic to the human

tt    of commitment... fulfills.

tHer eyes have clouded.  As if Michael is talking to her.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>tt    Some need to belong to one another
tt    in a way which rages against the
tt    notion... that all is impermanent.
tt    Against the notion of mortality.

tAnd suddenly, ALL the feeling rises in her throat.

<b>ttttMICHAEL (O.S.)
</b>tt    Our love is bigger.  And longer.
tt    Than life itself.

tAnd the tears come.  They come freely, unhidden, unnoticed.  As if

tMichael now.  Looking at his bride.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    That's what we want.  And marriage.
tt    Is what we do about it.

tKimmy smiles at him.  With love bigger than life itself.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    We are fools in this.  Thank
tt    God Almighty.

tHe is done.  There is a silence.

<b>ttttMINISTER
</b>tt    Boy, that was good!

tPeople LAUGH.  The Minister holds up a sheet of paper.  For the
tcrowd to see.  Mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink.

<b>ttttMINISTER
</b>tt    Michael and Kim also edited what
tt    they want me to say...

tMore laughter.

<b>ttttMINISTER
</b>tt    The idea was, we're only marrying

tt    forever.  Let's keep to the good

ttt    (squints at the sheet)
tt    You may kiss the bride.

tBigger LAUGHTER.  The Minister waves this off, his little joke.
tTurns to the best man, pantomimes the ring.  As the hammered gold
tcircle is handed to Michael, Julianne absently scratches her still-
tswollen finger.  Mandy taps Julianne on the arm, and produces...

t... a matching ring.  Take it! Gives it to her.  So Julianne steps
tforward.  Places the second ring into Kimmy's waiting hand.  Their
teyes meet, and hold throughout...

<b>ttttMINISTER (O.S.)
</b>tt    If anyone here can show just cause

tJulianne CLEARS her throat.  Kimmy's heart flutters.  In the
tsilence... Julianne's wonderful smile.  Just kidding.

tMichael reaches for Kim's hand, turns her gently to him.  Places
this ring on her finger.  Holds her hands.

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Kimberly.  I promise to love.
tt    And respect and comfort you.

tShe swallows.  Smiles a fleeting, beautiful smile.  Fumbles
tslightly, putting the ring on his finger.

<b>ttttKIMMY
</b>tt    Michael.  I promise to love and
tt    respect and comfort you.  To
tt    hear your voice and your heart.
tt    Until we are parted by death.

tStaring in each other's eyes.  A moment so fragile, the Minister
twaits an extra beat.

<b>ttttMINISTER
</b>tt    For the record, you each agree
tt    to marry the other?

<b>ttttKIMMY

<b>tEXT.  WALLACE POND - NIGHT
</b>

tthe guests dancing on the hardwood floor, at the base of the gazebo.
tThe bride and groom among them, relaxed and happy.  Two who are one.
<b>tPAN TO...
</b>
t... the stage, the band playing.  Julianne conferring with the twins
tand the band leader, clear that she's giving the instructions.
tThen, she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone...

t... KLUNKS it, for silence.  The band stops.  The dancers follow.
tAll eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor.  She looks to
tthe couple.  Just below her.  Then, to the crowd...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'm a writer, too, not as
tt    good as Michael.  But I do

tShe raises her glass.  Everyone at the table does the same.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    This is to my best friend.  On

tShouts of support, a few whistles.  Silence.  She tells Michael...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    If I have truly come to know
tt    your bride as my new sister.
tt    This is in her heart...

tShe has to stop.  Swallows.  Because she will not let herself cry.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    "Understand.  I'll slip quietly
tt    away from the noisy crowd when

tDeep breath.  Looks in his eyes.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    "I'll pursue solitary pathways
tt    through the pale twilit meadows,
tt    with only this one dream: You
tt    come too."

tA hush.  SHARP applause.  From four hundred hands.  But not from
this.  He is too moved.  Too understanding of what he has heard.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I don't have a wedding gift.
tt    But this is on loan.  Until

tAnd with that the band begins.  The opening phrases of a song we
thave come to know.  Michael seems overwhelmed.  Julianne nods
ttoward the gazebo...

t... Michael takes his bride's hand, leads her up the stairs, into
this arms, as the twins step to the microphone, and guests begin to
tapplaud an unscheduled wedding dance...

tsinging to...

<b>ttttJULIANNE/MANDY/SAMMY
</b>ttt    (singing)
tt    You're lovely, please don't ever change,
tt       Keep that breathless charm,
tt    Darling, please arrange it, cos I love you...
tt       Just the way you look tonight.

tThe band keeps playing.  The dance goes on.  Two people lost in each
tother.  The way it's supposed to be.

<b>tINT.  GREAT ROOM - LATE NIGHT
</b>
tBedlam.  Julianne caught in the middle of the throng.  A young
tcouple, dressed for travel, appear at the top of the staircase.
tThe SHOUT are deafening.  The bride has her bouquet...

t... she spots Julianne far below.  THROWS it her way, Julianne
treflexively GOES FOR IT...

t... not a fucking chance.  The twins nearly TRAMPLE her in the
tstampede, Mandy WRESTING the prize from Sammy's grasp.  Everyone
tCHEERS, and then the couple is...

t... FLYING down the stairs, RACING through the crowd with a
tprotective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards, heading for the door,
tfor freedom...

t... Julianne, trapped in the crush, loses sight of the couple,
tstruggles against the flow, suddenly panicked by the certainty
tthat she will never see him before...

tAnd then, he's THERE.  He has Julianne in his arms.  Holding her
tso tight.  An embrace so wonderful, so terrible, she could go mad
tfrom the confusion alone.  Against the din, he murmurs in her
tear...

<b>ttttMICHAEL
</b>tt    Wherever I go.  However far...

tShe sobs.  Holds him.

tDeep, deep breath.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You win a few, you lose a few.
tt    Some get rained out.

tAnd to her surprise...

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>ttt     (V.O., very softly)
tt    You have a good time?

tTo her greater surprise.  There are a few tears left, after all.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I did what I came to do.

<b>ttttDIGGER
</b>ttt    (V.O., even softer)
tt    Good girl.

tShe just can't speak now.  So she doesn't.

<b>ttttDIGGER (V.O.)
</b>tt    I was thinking.  Maybe you might
tt    visit us for awhile.  We've got
tt    the room made up.

tThis fucking guy.  God, she loves him.

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    I'll think about it.  I'm okay.

<b>ttttDIGGER (V.O.)
</b>tt    Oh, you're more than okay.

tJust above a whisper...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    You, too.

tAnd with the last of her strength...

<b>ttttJULIANNE
</b>tt    If the sun comes up, I'll see
tt    you tomorrow, huh?

tA chuckle.  At the other end.

<b>ttttDIGGER (V.O.)
</b>tt     I'll play those odds.  You have
tt     sweet dreams.

tWe hear the CLICK.  She turns her back on the stars.  Shoulders
tstraight.  Chin up.

tShe walks from frame.
