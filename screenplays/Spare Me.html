</b>
The screen is black. Thunder rumbles.

<b>ttTHEO (VO)
</b>tWhen you hear thunder...

A black bowling ball pulls away from the lens. The ball is in
the hands of THEO SKINNER, an intense, handsome 28 year old
man with sideburns dressed in worn bowling attire.

<b>ttTHEO (VO)
</b>t...God is bowling.

He holds the ball in front of him, wristbrace on, his face a
study in concentration.

<b>2     EXT. BRIDGE - DAYtttt     2
</b>
An empty causeway spans a bay somewhere along the south shore
of Long Island. The sky is overcast. SHEILA, a woman in her
late twenties, wearing a full length heliotrope pleather coat
over a waitress outfit, kneels in the middle of the road. A
souped-up Vespa motor scooter stands nearby.

<b>KEN AND BARBIE
</b>
Sheila holds a Bridal Barbie and Ken doll set. She sets them
down on the road, pulls out a can of lighter fluid and soaks
the dolls. She pulls out a bowling pin-shaped lighter and
torches the nuptial tableau.

<b>3     INT. THEO'S CARtttt       3
</b>
Theo drives his ratty old American car along a highway. The
car has Ohio plates. He sucks coffee from a 7-Eleven "Big-
Swig" cup and examines a map. A yellow plastic "Bowler on
Board" sign is stuck to a side window. Theo's music PLAYS.
His eyes nod off, then snap awake.

<b>4     NIGHTMAREtttttt4
</b>
The screen is black, except for three circles in the middle
of the screen. The light shining through them is snuffed out
by three large pink objects. There is a loud POP, like a

thumb being pulled out of a tight hole.

<b>ttBOWLING BALL
</b>tA slow motion low tracking shot of a
tbowling ball hitting a polished lane.

<b>ttBOWLING PINS
</b>tClose-up of the milky white surface of
ttwo bowling pins on opposite sides of the
tlane - a seven-ten split. The RUMBLING
tball is heard in the distance like a
tfurious hulking steamroller of doom. The
tpins begin to tremble, and then transform
tinto a Bridal Ken and Barbie. The dolls
tburst into flame.

<b>ttBALL
</b>tThe ball blasts past the camera and
tmetamorphoses into Theo's car.

<b>tttt   RAPID DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>5     EXT. BRIDGEttttt 5
</b>
Theo's sedan blasts past the camera down the empty road.

<b>ttBURNING DOLLS
</b>tThe flaming couple stand in the middle of
tthe bridge. Theo's car hits the pair and
tthey fly into the air in slow-motion. A
tdistant SOUND of pins scattering is
theard. The two dolls smoke as they spin
tinto the sky, then hit the water with
tdual HISSES.

<b>tttt        DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>6     PIN RESET MACHINERYtttt   6
</b>
An American Machine and Foundry pin reset machine performs
its functions like a mechanical ballet as the camera follows
a bowling ball through its journey. The "Spare Me!" theme
MUSIC (similar to "Balboa Blue" by the Marketts) swells.
TITLE: SPARE ME! appears on the bowling ball. Pins tumble
across the back plate, are loaded into the pin conveyor,
lifted up to the crown feeder, distributed into the rotating
carousel, and then set down in perfect formation upon the
polished bowling alley.

BURN-IN PRINCIPAL PLAYER TITLES. Titles appear on the pins.
The ball trundles along the return trough straight into the
lens.

<b>7     INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAYtttt   7
</b>
A muzak cover of 'Broke, Busted, and Disgusted' PLAYS in the
background as Theo gingerly pulls a hot taco out of the
microwave oven. ALFIE, the rickety old man who runs the
store, shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping
it down. Theo pokes at the taco with a spork as steam rises.
He pulls a disgusted grimace. Alfie pours himself a cup of
coffee and then attempts to open a tiny container of half &
half. Because his hands are shaking so much, the cream goes
everywhere but into the coffee.

<b>ttALFIE
</b>tI'm an addict. I can't go through a day
twithout the stuff. Theo reaches over and
tpours for him with a steady hand.

<b>ttALFIE
</b>tYou're not from around here, are you?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm from Akron.

Alfie looks at Theo's bowling shoe attired feet.

<b>ttALFIE
</b>tYou a bowler?

Theo's hand starts shaking uncontrollably. He puts down the
cream.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm looking for a man.

<b>ttALFIE
</b>tWhat kind of man?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tA bowler.

Alfie presses a matchbook into Theo's hand and then trundles
off. Theo looks down at the matchbook; it reads "Bowl for
health, enjoy yourself. Babylon Lanes."

<b>8     EXT. BABYLON LANES - TWILIGHTttt   8
</b>
Theo pulls into the empty parking lot of Babylon Lanes beside
a cheap looking American sedan.

<b>9     INT. BABYLON LANEStttt    9
</b>
Theo walks into an empty run-down forty lane bowling alley
carrying his ball bag. It is dark. The fluorescent lights
switch on and the pin re-set machines whirr into action. SID
and BREEZE, two shady looking guys in a basement-sale suits
walk up lane dividers towards Theo.

<b>ttSID
</b>tLane's closed big fellah, league night.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm not here to bowl.

<b>ttSID
</b>tt(gesturing to Theo's bag)
tYou drag that coconut around for your
thealth, or do you know how to use it?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(bristling at the challenge)
tI'm looking for somebody.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tHey, ain't I seen you on the tour?

<b>ttSID
</b>tNo, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm looking for Buzz Fazeli.

Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tFazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.

<b>ttSID
</b>tWhat do you want with old man Faz?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tSome unfinished business.

<b>ttSID
</b>tIf you wanna do business in this town,
tthere's other people around here got more
tweight than old Faz.

A lady dwarf walks by.

<b>ttDWARF
</b>tEvening Sid, evening Breeze.

<b>ttSID
</b>tEvening Tina.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tGood luck tonight Tina.

Tina opens a door and goes down some stairs.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou guys got something going on
tdownstairs?

<b>ttSID
</b>tWe provide some extracurricular
tactivities for the senior citizens in the
tcommunity.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tBasement bingo?

Breeze sniggers into his hand

<b>ttSID
</b>tt(smirks)
tYeah, basement bingo.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tLemme see your ball.

Breeze grabs Theo's bag.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tLet go of my bag.

Sid sidles around behind Theo who tries to keep him in sight.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tAh, come on, lemme see your ball.

<b>ttSID
</b>tYou afraid we're gonna steal it?

Breeze unzips the bag and pulls the ball out. Theo's temper
is rising, he breathes deeply. He is obviously making a
Herculean effort to keep himself in check.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI said, let go of my bag.

With lightning speed Theo's hand shoots out and grabs the
middle fingers on Sid's right hand. Sid howls in agony.

<b>ttSID
</b>tAagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tTell your little pal to let go.

<b>ttSID
</b>tBreeze, give him his ball back!

Breeze, astonished, drops Theo's ball into the bag. Sid
cringes in front of Theo.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhere can I find Buzz Fazeli?

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tWhoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge,
tpast the Peter Pan, last house on the
tdead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid
tdrops to his knees and cradles his
tdamaged hand.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tHaven't seen a ball like that since '69.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tIt belonged to my dad.

Theo turns and walks out.

<b>10     EXT. WOODS - NIGHTtttt   10
</b>
JUNIOR, a dumpy man in his late thirties with a rat tail, bad
skin and wearing a white straitjacket and fluorescent orange
pants, runs desperately through dark woods. Bloodhounds BARK
in the distance.

<b>11     EXT. ROAD - NIGHTtttt    11
</b>
Theo drives over the draw-bridge and past the Peter Pan Diner
with its huge neon sign.

<b>12     EXT. DEAD END STREETtttt 12
</b>
Theo's car pulls up in front of a modest suburban house. A
rooftop weather vane in the shape of a bowler CREAKS
ominously in the wind.

<b>13     EXT. BUZZ'S HOUSEtttt    13
</b>
Theo rings the doorbell. The porch light comes on, and
MILLIE, a fifty-five year-old woman dressed for a night on
the town in Reno, but with fuzzy slippers and a hairnet,
opens the door. A miniscule neurotic poodle leaps at Theo's
bowling ball bag, YAPPING and snapping at it.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tIs Mr. Fazeli in please?

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tWho wants to know?
tt(to dog)
tZeus!

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm a bowler.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tI'm sick of you people. Why don't you
tleave him be?

<b>ttBUZZ (OS)
</b>tLet him in, Millie. And don't frisk him.

<b>14     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOMttt 14
</b>
Millie and Theo, with Zeus hot on his trail, enter the room.
BUZZ FAZELI, a sixty-five year-old man shaped a lot like a
compressed bowling pin, slouches in a recliner. The room is
decorated with trophies of Buzz's bygone pro-bowling halcyon
days.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tOh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I
tleave the door wide open. Let the parade
tbegin!

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tClam it!

Millie is silent. Buzz gets up and approaches Zeus.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tHey, rat. C'mere.

Zeus growls at Buzz as he comes nearer, then clamps onto his
sleeve and hangs from his arm, growling ferociously. In one
smooth motion, Buzz flings the rabid poodle through an open
window and into the night.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tJerk.

She heads outside.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tSit down.

Theo sits on the edge of the couch. Buzz puts out his hand.
Theo shakes it.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tBuzz Fazeli.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tTheo.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI know your face, you're an up-and-comer.
tYou bowl on the tour.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm not on the tour this year.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(nods understandingly)
tNeed some advice, huh.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWell, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress
tsays I'm a thorn in their side.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(dismissive wave)
tDon't worry about the Congress, they're
tjust a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.

<b>15     EXT. THEO'S CARtttt      15
</b>
Millie's furry slippers protrude from the driver's side door.
Zeus chews furiously on the yellow plastic 'Bowler On Board'
sign. She rifles through the contents of the overstuffed
glove compartment. She notices her dog.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tt(under her breath)
tGet that outta your mouth!

<b>16     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOMttt 16
</b>
<b>ttTHEO
</b>tThey suspended me.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tWhy'd they suspend you?

Theo's eyes glaze over, the lights in the room dim, and Buzz
seems to recede into the far distance.

<b>17     TV SCREEN - FLASHBACKtttt17
</b>
In ultra-slow scan we see an image of two bowlers, one is
smiling cockily to off-screen fans and waving, the other is
Theo, his face filled with hate, winding up to smash the
other man in the head with his bowling ball.

<b>ttTHEO (VO)
</b>tIt wasn't really my fault.

In the far background the hollow booming VOICE of a judge
delivers sentence.

<b>ttJUDGE (VO)
</b>tThe American Bowling Congress hereby
tsuspends Theo Maynard Skinner from all
tprofessional bowling activities within
tthe jurisdiction of the American Bowling
tCongress and its international co-
tsigners... The ball mashes into the
tsmirking mans head, causing it to snap
tforward. The judge's gavel BANGS and the
tcrowd ROARS.

<b>18     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOMttt 18
</b>
Theo snaps out of it, the room lights come up, and Buzz leans
in.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI got suspended when I was young, too. I
twas pretty cocky in my day.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tThey suspended me for 100 years.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>t100 years!
tt(knits his brow)

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI can appeal in five. I was hoping you
tcould help me Mr. Fazeli.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(uneasy)
tWhat do you think I can do?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(sweating slightly)
tI need a sponsor to get my sanction card
tback. Where I come from, you're the king.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tSure, around here, any fat old bald guy
tcould be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't
tdo any good for me to talk to the
tCongress.
tt(briskly changing subject)
tHey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI've never had orange whips, I'm from
tAkron.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>19     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, KITCHENtttt 19
</b>
Millie and Buzz are in the kitchen, talking in loud whispers.
Millie fills a blender while Buzz cuts oranges.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tHe's the guy Buzz.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tHe's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the
twhips.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tI looked in his car. He's got pictures of
tyou, clippings, maps.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tBowlers don't go around killing other
tbowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll
tgive him some tips and an autograph and
the's outta here.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tYou're in trouble, aren't you Buzz?
tYou're doing something dangerous in that
talley.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tMillie, I know what I'm doing.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tWe should leave this town. I can't take
tthis anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill
tyou in my house.

<b>20     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOMttt 20
</b>
Buzz rejoins Theo in the living room.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tRemember the finals in Akron in '59? You
thad a seven-ten split in the final frame.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tYeah, against that prick VanDeMark.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tTen thousand to one, but you pegged it.
tThe toughest shot on the last frame.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tThat game was before you was born.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tMy mom was there. She told me about it.
tThe 'Fazeli Split.'

<b>21     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, KITCHENtttt 21
</b>
The blender is wailing at high speed as Millie throws in a
whole box of laxative, a can of Drano and a jar of pills. Her
hands are trembling.

<b>22     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOMttt 22
</b>
Millie walks into the living room with a silver tray holding
two orange whips; one thick and deadly, the other thin and
safe. There is laughter coming from both men.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tAnd the irony is, thirty years later,
tthat prick is bowling in the seniors on
tTV all over the world, and look at me. Ah
twell. The docs made me stop, on account
tof my ticker.
tt(taps his chest)
tI don't really miss it, but then...
tt(chokes up)
t...I miss it.

He spies Millie approaching with the tray.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tOrange whip, nectar of the bowling gods.
tThanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so
tthat Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo
ttakes the other glass.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tThanks.

<b>ttZEUS
</b>tZeus is on the sofa, GROWLING and tugging
tat Theo's bowling bag. The bag rips apart
tand the ball hits the floor.

<b>ttORANGE WHIP
</b>tTheo brings the drink to his lips. The
tball rolls across the room.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tThe ball rolls into Buzz's feet.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tThis your lucky bullet?

Buzz picks it up and reads the writing on the ball. He snaps
a look into the kitchen, seeing the empty Drano and laxative
cartons. Buzz slams the drink away from Theo's lips. The
drink explodes across the room. Buzz is up on his feet.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(with intensity)
tWhere'd you get this ball?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(stunned - looks at the mess on
tt the floor, then at Buzz)
tIt's mine.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tWho gave it to you?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tGrace Skinner.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(astonished)
tGrace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to
tyou?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tShe's my mom.

Theo stands and takes the ball from Buzz's hands. Buzz is in
shock, staring at Theo.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(regaining his voice)
tWho are you? Who sent you here?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm your son. You're a hard father to
tfind.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tSon?

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(to Millie)
tMillie, please.
tt(to Theo)
tI don't have a son.
tI think you better leave now young man.
tBuzz gestures towards the front door.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(calmly)
tGrace Skinner Fazeli, you must remember
ther?

Buzz takes Theo by the elbow to eject him from the house.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI don't know no Grace Skinner.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(pulls his arm away)
tYou knew her. You married her in 1963.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tMarried?

Buzz grabs a large bowling trophy and waves it at Theo.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tYou're a bullshit artist, that's what you
tare. You got no right to be here! Theo
tyanks the trophy away from Buzz.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI got a right. You're my father.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI ain't nobody's father!

Theo hurls the trophy at Buzz. He ducks and the trophy sails
into a large glass trophy case. Broken glass and trophies fly
everywhere.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tt(noticing Zeus)
<b>tZEUS!
</b>
Zeus is laid out cold near the spilled orange whip on the
living room floor. Millie hunches over her comatose poodle.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tMy poor baby!

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(to Theo)
tYou see what you did?
tt(he picks up the ball)
tTake your ball and get out.

Theo takes the ball and exits the house.

<b>23     EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHTtttt  23
</b>
Theo, bathed in sweat, practices his release form with
obsessive determination. He is alone near the empty bridge.
Sheila spies on him from behind the bridge control booth.
Theo takes a long slug from a bottle of liquor. He hears a
motor scooter start and ROAR off into the night.

<b>24     INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAYtttt  24
</b>
Theo stands at the self-serve island sipping coffee. A muzak
cover of 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' PLAYS.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(resignedly)
t99 years, 241 days,
tt(looks at his watch)
t15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling.
tAlfie shuffles up to the self-serve
tisland and begins wiping it down.

<b>ttALFIE
</b>tFind your bowler?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't
tthe man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying
tto affix the lid on his cup, but his
thands are trembling, spilling some of the
tcoffee.

<b>ttALFIE
</b>tMy father used to say to me "Never..."
tno, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...
tt(puzzles)
tAh! Love and hate are blood relations.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tMaybe I should have left the ball in the
tcar.

<b>25     EXT. BUZZ'S HOUSE - DAYtttt    25
</b>
Millie kneels on the front lawn patting dirt down on a little
grave marked by a wooden cross. Theo walks up.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tHe's not here.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tt(points to grave)
tThis is a sign! Someone's coming to take
tBuzz away from me. I don't know if you're
tthe guy or what, but I'm not letting it
thappen. I'm leaving him first.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help.
tTheo helps Millie load suitcases into the
ttrunk of her car.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tBuzz Fazeli never helps anybody but
thimself.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tHe's my father, Millie.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tHe's no father to you.

Theo lifts a box full of new bowling pins into the trunk.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tCareful with that one. He won't tell me
tanything, but I know there's something
tstrange going on over at the lanes. If
tyou ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to
tdie.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhere can I find him?

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tt(looks at her watch)
tThe Peter Pan.

Millie gets into the car.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tYou tell Buzz I went to my sister's in
tRonkonkoma. Oh, I'm sorry about trying to
tkill you last night, Theo. It was nothing
tpersonal. Millie puts on a pair of
tsunglasses and patches out in a cloud of
tgravel and dust.

<b>26     INT. PETER PAN DINER - DAYtttt 26
</b>
A blender WHIRRS. Sheila, in her waitress uniform, carefully
chops something.
She watches an indoor motocross rally on the diner's color
TV. 12-PACK, a hefty construction worker, sits at the
counter.

<b>tt12-PACK
</b>tHey Sheila, how's that orange whip
tcomin'?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tt(mimicking him under her
tt breath)
tHow's that orange whip comin'?

THWAP! Sheila is dismembering a Ken doll with a big knife.
She scoops the parts into the blender and switches from purx8ee
to frappx8e.

<b>tt12-PACK
</b>tSo, I heard Junior busted out again?

Sheila puts the glass down in front of 12-Pack with a THUNK.

<b>tt12-PACK
</b>tHey Sheila, you can whip my oranges
tanytime. Sheila puts a Barbie head
tearring on her left ear. Buzz comes into
tthe diner and slides into a booth. Sheila
twalks over with a pot of coffee.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tCup of joe Mr. Fazeli?

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tYeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't
tsleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a
tcup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his
thands trembling.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tYou don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you
tneed a vacation. Sheila catches sight of
tTheo pulling into the parking lot. She
tputs a Ken head earring in her right ear.
tBuzz follows Sheila's gaze.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(groans)
tSome people will do anything for an

twalks over to Buzz.

<b>ttTHEO

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tYou know what a mixer ball is? It's like

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tOh, a professional man. What'll you have?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhat's your specialty?

<b>ttSHEILA

tThe eggs.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(discomfited at the blatant

tUh...over easy.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tComing right up.

Sheila smiles and walks away. Theo watches her slink behind
the counter.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tWatch out for that one. She's got a great
taverage, but she's looking for a prince.
tAnd, believe me, she's
tt(more)

<b>ttBUZZ

tListen, I been thinking about your

tsomething I could do for you.

tPutt-putt golf.

<b>ttTHEO

Buzz pulls a golf ball from his pocket, flashes it and slips
it back.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tIt's the next level, the next
tdimension...
tt(deep conviction)
t...the small ball.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(in Buzz's spell)
tThe small ball.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tIt's gonna be bigger than big. Think
tEurope. Think Asia. They don't have room
tfor real golf courses in Japan.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(snapping out of it)
tNot for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tIf the Japanese are pansies, then pansies
tare my kind of people. Sheila steps over
tto the booth with their food. The Buzz
tBurger has three holes cut in the middle
tto make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz
tsees the two sleazeballs park their car
tand walk towards the diner.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(pondering the thought)
tMaybe I could bowl in Japan.

Buzz stands up abruptly.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI gotta wash up.

Buzz heads for the rest rooms. The door opens with a JINGLE.

<b>ttSID
</b>tThree whips. To go.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tWhen you get a chance.

Sid and Breeze walk over to Theo's booth and slide in. Sid's
middle fingers are taped to an aluminum splint. The BLENDER
kicks into action. Buzz watches the group from the bathroom
hall and tries to catch the conversation.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tHey, you still here?

<b>ttSID
</b>tWe're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI don't know no Buzz Fazeli.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tLook Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's
tfavorite lunch. Sid reaches for the
tplate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and
tpulls his burger away from Sid.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tGet away from that burger.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tSorry Faz, we didn't know you was here.

<b>ttSID
</b>tBuzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tt(to Theo and Buzz)
tAre you guys bruddas?

The booth party is silent for a moment. Theo LAUGHS.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tNo, we ain't brothers.

<b>ttSID
</b>tYou know why we call him Breeze?

Sid puts a hand near Breezes left ear and blows into Breeze's
right ear. He makes fluttering motions with his hand as if
wind was hitting it. Breeze's face breaks into a smile as he
pushes Sid away.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tHey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm
tserious! You guys are related, right?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tHe's my dad.

Buzz flashes a warning glare to Theo. Sid grabs some of
Buzz's french fries.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(slapping his hand)
tGet your own.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tSee that, toldja Sid. I knew I seen a
tresemblance.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tWhy don't you clowns get your whips and
tget lost.

<b>ttSID
</b>tLook, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual
tcharismatic self today when he told us to
ttell you...
tt(gazing artfully upwards and
tt rubbing his chin)
tWhat was that he said...?

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tI remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't
tlike no sticky fingers in the till.

<b>ttSID
</b>tt(exasperated)
tPinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.

Sheila comes over and PLUNKS down the three whips-to-go.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tt(to Sheila)
tYour pop said to put these on his tab.
tSid gets up and jerks his thumb towards
tthe door.

<b>ttSID
</b>tSo Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is
twaiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and
tsteps between his father and the two
tsleazeballs.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm coming with you.

Sid shies away from Theo, protecting his hand.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tEasy. I got business to do, Theo. I'll
tcome back and haunt you later.
tt(drops a twenty on the table,
tt pats Theo's cheek)
tDon't say I never gave you nothing.

Buzz goes outside with a sleazeball on either side. Sheila
takes the twenty dollar bill. Theo grabs his jacket and makes
for the door.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(to Sheila)
tDo those two work for your dad or mine?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tMine, and they never tip.

The sleazeballs hustle Buzz into the front seat of their car
and patch out.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tDo you know where they're taking him?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tYeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there
tfor my dad. Everybody who has anything to
tdo with bowling in this town answers to
tmy dad. Theo splits.

<b>27     EXT. WOODS - DAYtttt     27

Junior is running at breakneck speed through the thick brush.
Bloodhounds BARK. Junior slows down and drops to his knees,
gasping for breath. He looks up to the sky. The camera pushes
up to his sweaty, tortured face.

MILES KASTLE lounges in a cheap chair behind Buzz's desk
toying with one of those motorized wire balancing sculptures
they have in airport souvenir concessions. He is a carefully
groomed middle-aged low-budget version of Hugh Hefner in an
acrylic sweatsuit with 'Miles 'O' Lanes' embroidered on the
front. Sid and Breeze push Buzz into the room. Buzz is poker
faced.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tBuzz.

Buzz nods.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tt(to Breeze)
tYou got my whip?

Breeze pulls the third whip out of a bag and gives it to him.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tt(motions to Sid and Breeze)
tLose yourselves.

Sid and Breeze leave the room. Buzz goes to a locker and
begins changing into a flashy MC outfit.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tWhat's on your mind, Miles?

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tWe've been partners a long time now,
thaven't we Buzz?

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tSeven years.

Kastle pokes a straw into the whip and takes a long drag.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tThis scam we got going here was your

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tbrainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it
twas a rotten idea, but I put up the
tscratch.
tt(pulls a smile)
tAnd now we got a beautiful thing.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tIt's a beautiful thing.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tA beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz?
tYou know what we got? Buzz raises an
teyebrow as he buttons his shirt.

<b>ttMILES
</b>tWe got balance.

Kastle flicks the little wire man. It bobs and sways.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tA partnership is a very delicate balance.
tBut let's say something tips the scales,
tmaybe one partner takes more than his
tshare, then... Kastle tips the wire man
toff his perch. The little motor squeals
tpathetically.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>t... oops. We got no more balance.

Buzz looks on with narrowed eyes as he adjusts his cravat.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tAnd look at that; both partners go down
ttogether. Kastle shoves the sculpture
tonto the floor, stands up, and crushes it
tunder his heel. He goes over and puts his
tarm around Buzz.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tSimple math, Buzz.
tt(he holds up his fingers)
tTwo plus two does not equal three.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tMiles, I've always been on the square

</b>tBreak a leg...

<b>29     INT. DWARF BOWLING ALLEYtttt   29
</b>
APPLAUSE erupts as Buzz appears in the spotlight. The dwarf
bowling alley is a pungently smoke-filled room peopled with
shady, washed-up bowlers sitting in chairs behind a bowling
lane. The old-timers are shouting and pounding shots.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(over the PA)
tGreetings, ladies, gentlemen.

tMy dentist told me this one the other

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tIt takes three bowlers to screw in a

Theo drives through the full parking lot of Babylon Lanes. He
pulls around the back and sees dark figures slip into a back
door. He parks his car, walks over to the now closed door.
It's locked. Theo finds another entrance and sneaks in. He
creeps his way through the darkened alley towards the sound
of raucous partying.

<b>ttBUZZ (OS)
</b>tWelcome to Buzz Fazeli's Dwarf Bowling,

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI would like to draw your attention to
tthe top of the lane.
tt(a Casio drum roll PLAYS)
tWeighing in at sixty-nine pounds and

tthe Terrible! The crowd CHEERS as the
tspotlight moves to Tina, a masked lady

tleather and cowhide western style S&M
toutfit. She CRACKS a whip and leers at
tthe bowlers. They HOWL with excitement.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tDon't be shy, folks!

Tina straps into her customized skateboard. A drunken
customer forks over a wad of bills, steps up and grabs hold
of the mini-human projectile.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tAnd - bowl 'er!

Tina is hurled head-first towards the pins. The crowd goes
wild.

tcrashes into the pins.

Theo sneaks into an empty bathroom. He hears voices and ducks
into a stall. Sid and Breeze shove Buzz into the room.

<b>ttSID
</b>tSeems to me like you ain't got much
tchoice Buzz.

Sid shoves Buzz over to Breeze, Breeze shoves him back.

<b>ttBREEZE

</b>tAaay, hands off the tux!

Sid checks under the stalls, sees Theo's feet and whips open
the door.

<b>ttSID
</b>tThe busyboy!

Sid yanks Theo out.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tGet your hands off me, you moron.

Theo tries to free himself from Sid's grip. He turns to Buzz.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhat the fuck is this?

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tWhat's it look like to you?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tIt looks like dwarf bowling.

tDwarf bowling's illegal.

tWhat are you gonna do, call the bowling

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI do what I gotta do to survive.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou have no right to call yourself a

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be.
tI deal with my own shit. I ain't asking
tanyone to bail me out.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm your blood.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tYou wish!

Theo pushes Buzz up against a stack of boxes full of new
bowling pins. Sid and Breeze hover behind them.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou knew she was pregnant.

Buzz reaches inside a box and pulls out a pin. He waves it
threateningly at Theo.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tWhat makes you so sure it was me? She
tcoulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes
tBuzz and grabs his arm. The two men
tstruggle for the pin.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tDon't say that about my mom!

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI had a career. She wanted a little
tbowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap
tinto the fray, prying the two men apart.
tThey wrestle Theo against a wall,
tpressing his face into the tiles.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tFuck you and fuck bowling.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tThat's a laugh. You're all strung out.
tYou're a bowling junkie.

Theo is dragged through the dwarf alley crowd. He has blood
on his face. Half dazed, he looks up at all the distorted
leering faces that peer down at him. The crowd cat-calls and
laughs at Theo.

<b>34     EXT. PETER PAN DINER - DAYtttt 34
</b>
Theo sits in his parked car outside the Peter Pan diner.
Squinting in the bright light, he examines the cuts on his
face in the sideview mirror. He is looking scruffier. He sees
Sheila come out of the diner, start her scooter, and pull out
into traffic. He follows her.

<b>35     EXT. BRIDGEttttt35

He follows the Vespa at a discreet distance as Sheila drives
over the bridge. The weather is windy and threatening.
Thunder RUMBLES.

<b>36     EXT. MILES 'O' LANEStttt 36
</b>
Theo pulls in next to Sheila's scooter under the big neon
sign for Miles 'O' Lanes Bowling Center. With a huge CLAP of
thunder and the SOUND of falling pins, the skies release a
pounding downpour.

<b>37     KEN AND BARBIE, MACRO C.U.tttt 37

Sheila's Vespa is parked in the handicapped space. The dolls
are wired to the headset of the scooter. Large droplets of
rain roll down their faces.

<b>38     INT. MILES 'O' LANEStttt 38
</b>
Theo walks into an ultramodern eighty-lane bowling center,
bowling bag in hand.
A huge banner reads 'Mothers and Daughters Bowl Free
Tonight!' The entire place is filled with pairs of moms and
their daughters - bowling away in matching bowling attire. A
three year-old girl stands staring at Theo.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tHello.

<b>ttLITTLE GIRL
</b>tWaaaaaaaaah!

A mom grabs the little girl and whisks her away. Theo surveys
the alley and catches sight of Sheila bowling at the far end
of the alley.

<b>39     LANE, SHEILA & LUNAtttt  39

Sheila bowls with LUNA, a 30-ish black guy dressed in a Miles
'O' Lanes jumpsuit and wearing extensions in his hair. Sheila
prods her friend when she sees Theo.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tLuna, that's the guy. I saw him do this
tspooky bowling rain dance on the bridge.

<b>ttLUNA
</b>tTypical.

Theo walks over. Sheila presents Theo with her ball.

<b>ttSHEILA

tand sees the two pins standing.

</b>tNah, he won't do it.

twith joy.

As running FOOTSTEPS are heard, the camera whizzes down a
darkened alley towards the pins.

</b>t...and I want someone watching out for
tSheila while he's, uh, loose.

</b>
<b>45     INT. MILES KASTLE'S OFFICEtttt 45
</b>
Theo snaps out of it, the room lights come up, and Kastle
points to her image on the TV screen. Sheila turns and looks
up at the video camera. Theo and Sheila's eyes seem to meet.
Theo freezes for a moment.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI could do that.

As the two men shake hands, Sheila "flips the bird" to the
camera.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tOne thing,

tt section)
tkeep the meat in the freezer.

Theo and Sheila blast along the dark roadway on her Vespa,
Theo sitting behind Sheila.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(shouting above the engine)
tThis is a vicious cycle.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI think that a motorbike is one of the
tlast really free things that people can
tdo.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tIsn't this technically a scooter?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWhen I'm on my bike I feel like a wild
tperson.
tt(she looks sideways at Theo)
tBetter than any sex I've ever had.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tKinda tough on the butt.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tEverything has it's drawbacks.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhere did your brother escape from?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tThe mental hospital.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhat does he do?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tHe follows me, he tries to have sex with
tme, and then they send him to the nut-hut
tfor a while and then he gets out and then

</b>tWhoa.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tIt's a vicious cycle.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>47     EXT. PARKING FIELDtttt   47
</b>
Sheila and Theo motor across an empty beach parking field
towards a lone station wagon. Swing-a-delic MUSIC drifts from
the parked vehicle.

<b>47     EXT. STATION WAGONtttt   47
</b>
Sheila pulls up beside the wagon. She leads Theo towards a
group of partying people at the tailgate of the car; three
white women, three white men and Luna. Luna pulls a rubber
hookah hose out of his mouth and offers it to Theo.

<b>ttLUNA
</b>tHookah?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tNo thanks, I don't hookah.

<b>ttLUNA
</b>tTheo, you ever do the 'Swing'?

Theo shakes his head.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tThese guys all work at the alley, too.
tThis is John, Susan, Jon, Suzanne,
tJonathan, and Sue. Everyone welcomes Theo
tand Sheila.

<b>ttLUNA
</b>tt(screams)
tDance Break!

Luna throws himself into a wild body-whip as the music THROBS
massively.

<b>EXT. DANCE
</b>
Luna and Sheila do a wild jitterbug-derived Swing-a-Delic
dance surrounded by weaving white folk.

<b>EXT. BARBECUE
</b>
One of the guys is on crutches, has a neck brace, a chest
cast, and one arm in a truss. He stands by the barbecue and
flips burgers with his one free hand. Theo walks over to him.

<b>ttGUY
</b>tHey man, howyadoin'?

He wiggles his hand out of the end of his cast. Theo shakes
his fingers.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tDon't tell me, John.

<b>ttJOHN
</b>tCool!

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tTheo. Howzitgoin.

<b>ttJOHN
</b>tHey man, welcome to our parking lot.
tLemme give you some advice, if she asks
tyou to dance, make sure her brother's not
taround. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot
tlight, if you get my meaning.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tHow's that?

<b>ttJOHN
</b>tI was doing the lambada with her and the
tguy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to
tkill me. I swear man, the guy thought I
twas a pix96ata. If nobody else hadn't a
tbeen there, he wouldn't have stopped. He
twoulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just
tsnapped. How do you like your burger?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(meets eyes with Sheila)
tUh...over easy.

<b>ttJOHN
</b>tt(throws a blackened burger on
tt Theo's styrofoam plate)
tI'll tell you one thing, you won't see me
taround that alley with that freak on the
tloose. Stay away from his ass - and don't
tplay any of his fuckin' knock-knock
tjokes.

Luna comes over to Theo and grabs him. They start to dance.

<b>ttLUNA
</b>tSheila wants me to show you a few steps
tbefore you two swing-a-delic.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(uneasily)
tSo, you're the pinman around here?

<b>ttLUNA
</b>t...And one, and two, and yes, I am. But
tno one gets them working like Junior used
tto...and two, and one.. - they call him
tThe 'Quasimodo of the lanes.' He's the
tbest pinman there is.. and one and
ttwo...People used to say he got the
tmachines working so well 'cause he
tlubricated them with blood...and two, and
tone...but people just love saying things
tabout Junior.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tMind if I cut in?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tNo, not at all.

<b>EXT. DANCE
</b>
Theo pulls out his resin bag, powders up his hands, and goes
for Sheila. Theo and Sheila get low and nasty on the tarmac.
Sheila turns and does the freak to Theo, rubbing her rear end
into his crotch. As Theo and Sheila dance over near John he
makes a throat slitting gesture across his neck. Theo's hands
leave white prints on Sheila's butt. The Swing-a-delic funks
so hard it causes spontaneous audience dance riots and
structural damage in theaters across the country.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tYou and your sideburns are the talk of
tthe party, Theo.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tThe ladies in Akron call them thigh-
tticklers.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tCan I ask you something personal?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'd rather you didn't.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tDo you have a girlfriend?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tNot while I'm in training.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tDo you have a boyfriend?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(surprised)
tNo. Do You?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tNo. Not at the present.

<b>EXT. PARKING FIELD - NIGHT
</b>
Sheila and Theo toast marshmallows over the barbecue as the
rest of the party dances in the background.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tSo this brother of yours is hazardous to
tthe health of your dates?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tNobody in this town really understands
tJunior. When I went to family sessions
tfor him I realized he was the sanest one
tin the family. Actually, he's the only
tone in this whole fucking town who knows
texactly who he is and what he wants.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tUnfortunately what he wants is you.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tSo, what about you?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tDo I want you?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWe'll get into that later.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>48     INT. MILES KASTLE'S OFFICEtttt 48
</b>
Alone, Kastle stares at the bank of video monitors and runs a
battery powered fuzzball remover around his collar. The
monitors are deserted. Miles absently pans a camera over and
then sits bolt upright. On the screen he can see Buzz Fazeli,
in a room at Babylon Lanes, surrounded by large piles of
cash, stuffing rolls of bills into hollow bowling pins.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tt(with rising anger)
tWhy that filthy, slimey, double-crossing,
tmisbegotten, two-faced, mangy, son-of-a-
tbitch bastard!

The motor in the fuzz ball remover SHRIEKS as Miles squeezes
it to death. It shatters in his hands.

<b>49     EXT. PARKING FIELD - NIGHTtttt 49
</b>
Theo and Sheila lie on the roof of the station wagon. "Devil
With The Blue Dress" by Shorty Long plays on the stereo. The
rest of the party throws marshmallows at each other in the
distance.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tTheo, what would you do if you couldn't
tbowl?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI don't know. It's all I ever wanted to
tdo.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI wanted to be a motocross champion. My
tfolks didn't really care what I did. Then
tJunior blew a fuse and I became their
tlast hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed
tdown their throats, I got bowling. I
tnever understood how anyone could take it
tso seriously. I hope I'm not insulting
tyou.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tNo, I'm fascinated.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWhy were you suspended?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI used to be kind of wild. They used to
tcall me the bad boy of bowling.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tSo you're hoping Buzz can get you re-
tinstated?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWell, that was plan A.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWhat's plan B?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tPlan B is your dad.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWhat do you think my dad's gonna do for
tyou?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tHe said he'd sponsor me.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tHa! And what do you have to do for him?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tNothing.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tOh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do
tanything unless there's something in it
tfor him.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tHe asked me to keep an eye on you for a
tcouple of days.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWhat? Be my body guard?
tt(she laughs)
tHere's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my
tdad's sake. For your career. Sheila
tstarts to unbutton her bowling shirt.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tSheila, please.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tCome on Theo, what about plan C?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(looking worried)
tWhat's plan C?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tPlan C...
tt(opens her shirt, showing off
tt her brassiere)
t...is me.

Sheila takes Theo's nervous hands and places them inside her
shirt.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(torn)
tLook, Sheila, I really like you but...
tSheila rolls on top of him, and plants a
thickey on his neck.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(stopping her)
tForget it, Sheila.

<b>50     INT. MILES 'O' LANEStttt 50
</b>
Kastle hurries through the darkened bowling alley. He stops
short as a warning alarm begins to sound from somewhere deep
within the building. Lane six lights up and comes to life.
Kastle walks slowly forward.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tJunior? Is that you, Junior? Don't be
tafraid. Where are you? I won't hurt you.

<b>INT. MACHINERY GALLEY
</b>
Kastle stealthily sneaks along beside row upon row of silent
pin reset machines shining a flashlight in front of him.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tCome on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for
tyou, son. The beam of light catches
tJunior's face. He is crouched inside the
tmachine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut
tand bleeding and his straitjacket torn
tand filthy.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tNeeds lubrication. Lubrication.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tWe're having a party for you, boy. Cake
tand shish-k-bob, just like you love.
tJunior cringes away from the light.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tYou made me hurt him!

Kastle reaches into his pocket and pulls a gaudy digital
wristwatch from his pocket.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tLook what I got for you.

He holds the watch up in front of Junior. Junior looks
curiously at the watch.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tHappy Birthday Junior!

The watch begins to play an electronic version of "Raindrops
Keep Falling On My Head." Junior's face lights up.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tOoooooohhh.

Kastle begins luring Junior out of machine number six with
the watch.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tI have someone for you to play with
tJunior.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tSomeone wants to play with me?

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tI have someone for you to play Blueface
twith Junior.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tBlueface! Blueface is my favorite.

<b>51     EXT. ROAD, SID & BREEZE'S CAR - DAYtt      51

Breeze and Sid speed down a road in their damaged hulk. The
TENOR of Enrico Caruso can be heard from inside.

<b>51     INT. SID & BREEZE'S CARtttt    51
</b>
Breeze drives. Sid gazes out the window. Enrico Caruso WAILS
from the car stereo.

<b>ttSID
</b>tBowling used to be so pure, so...All-

tand pretends to conduct.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tLa da da dalala...

<b>ttSID
</b>tt(looking heatedly disturbed)
tI hate fuckin' opera.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tHow could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has

t- to music!

<b>ttSID
</b>tHow do you know, you don't even speak
tLatin?

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tYou listen to the feelings, not the

<b>ttSID
</b>tYou got an 8-track tape player on

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tIt was a clearance.

Sid seems to calm down.

<b>ttSID
</b>tt(wistfully)
tYou know, Elvis bowled.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tNo kiddin'.

<b>ttSID
</b>tBowling was the most incorruptible sport.
tNo megalomillionaires, no

<b>ttSID
</b>tgambling. And it was a safe place for
tkids, a place where the whole community
tcould meet for some wholesome, clean fun.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tt(sympathetically)
tSure, Sid.

<b>ttSID
</b>tt(becoming rabid)
tBut not no more. Now people take

tbe. There's something evil spreading in
tthis sport - like a big, gigantic, puss-

</b>tt(getting excited)
t- canker sore.

<b>ttSID
</b>tt(apoplectic)
tRight, eating at the core, eating it's

Sid starts pressing buttons on the tape deck

<b>ttSID
</b>tHow do you turn this thing off?

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tWait! That's an aria!

Sid and Breeze struggle for the cassette. The music DISTORTS
into a warbling gurgle of an aria.

<b>ttSID
</b>tGimme that!

Sid yanks the cassette out, but the tape becomes tangled in
the player. He pulls at the endless yards of tape and throws
the whole mess out the window.

<b>52     EXT. PETER PAN DINER - DAYtttt 52
</b>
Theo, wearing sunglasses and dressed in a jogging suit
similar to Miles Kastle's, steps out of the diner with a bag
containing four orange whips. He goes over to his parked car.
Buzz walks up.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(in deadly serious)
tTheo, I want you to get out of this town.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm getting to like it here.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(bitterly)
tThat's right, Buzz, and you know when I

tneeded was one spare for the crown - and
tI get stuck with the seven-ten, the

<b>ttBUZZ

tin a threatening manner.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(repressed fury in his voice)
tI was beaten on a shot named after my own

<b>tI SHOULDA HAD MY TUBES TIED!

<b>53     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, GARAGEtttt  53

The Kastle home is a huge nouveau riche Brady Bunch style
house with a large deck jutting over the driveway. The doors
are open on the spacious two car garage.
Sheila has the headset of her Vespa disassembled. Theo walks
up the driveway, orange whips in hand.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI don't think your new outfit suits you,

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tYou're here.

<b>55     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DRIVEWAYtttt55

tHe's here! Come on down!

tSsssh! Now real quiet. On three.

The lid flies up and Kastle, Sheila, and Theo stand there,
with party hats and party horns in their mouths. They all
cheer and throw confetti.

<b>ttEVERYONE
</b>tSurprise!

Kastle takes a flash snapshot. Junior, lying on some folded
blankets in the trunk, looks at his family with a stunned
expression. He is in a straitjacket. Junior's new watch
begins to PLAY "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head". He
struggles to pull his arm out, but can't. Kastle reaches in
to untie the straitjacket.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tSteady boy, steady.

Untied, Junior presses the BEEPING watch against his ear. His
face breaks into a beatific smile.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:

<b>56     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, PICNIC TABLE - AFTERNOONtt    56
</b>
Kastle pulls shish kebab chunks off a skewer. He looks down
to see that one of the chunks is a melted Ken head. He throws
it away in disgust.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tI bet you didn't know that you and Junior
thave something in common, Theo: Junior
tcan't bowl anymore either. Isn't that
tright Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup
tbottle down on Junior's right hand. The
ttable settings jump from the shock.
tJunior sits impassively, his face a
tblank.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tSee! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened
tto your hand, Junior.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tAfter we eat, Dad.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tHe stuck it in the ball return machine
twhen he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve
tendings. Junior starts stroking the
tketchup bottle with his dead hand.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tIt's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels
tlike someone else. Sheila grabs the
tbottle from Junior, opens it and pours
tsome on her shish kebab. She leans over
tand whispers furiously to her father.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tDo you have to get your hooks into every

</b>tLook who's talking!

</b>tLeave him alone!

</b>tJust because your mother signed part

tSheila and Kastle sit up.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tJunior, how 'bout a riddle?

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tt(turns to Sheila)
tSheila. Knock-knock.

Sheila glances nervously at Theo.

tCome on Sheila, knock-knock.

A bowling pin-shaped cake with candles ablaze is presented to
a seated Junior. He is wearing a paper birthday hat. The four
orange whips are arrayed around the table.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tMake a wish, son.

Junior stares into Sheila's eyes for several seconds.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tSame wish as last year.

Sheila blows out the candles in a hurry.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tIt won't come true, Junior.

Kastle places a gift-wrapped box in front of Junior and lifts
the lid. He reaches in and pulls out a huge, intricate claw-
like arm-shaped device made of plastic and metal and covered
with cables.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tIt's a bowling claw. You can bowl now,
tJunior. With the whole family. Junior
tbeams at the group.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tt(puts one arm around Junior and
tt one on Theo)
tPretty soon everybody can bowl!

The two sleazeballs walk up onto the deck and over to the
table.

<b>ttSID
</b>tHello Mr. Kastle.
tt(nods to seated party)
tJunior, long time. I thought they locked
tyou up and threw away the warden!

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tIs it true they blacked out the whole

tlooks from one man to the other,

tDon't do it Breeze!

tYou ain't getting us into that.

Kastle gets up.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tHey, enough fun and games. We have work
tto do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for
this car. Junior gets up and follows. The
ttwo sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.

<b>ttSID
</b>tt(to Theo)
tIf Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy-

tdance on your spleen.

The two men turn, laughing, and follow Kastle.

Kastle huddles with Sid and Breeze, Jr. stands nearby
fiddling with his new bowling arm.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tBuzz has been moving the cash out in

tsideways glances at each other.

</b>tNo!

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tI want you two to pick up Buzz and bring

<b>60     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DECKtttt    60
</b>
Theo and Kastle stand on the deck watching the sleazeballs
put Junior into the trunk of their car. Kastle lights an
oversized cigar and hands one to Theo.

<b>ttMILES
</b>tChamp, as soon as you get back on the
ttour, we should do an instructional
tvideotape. 'RAMBOWL' Theo Skinner teaches
tPower Bowling. You on the cover with a

tand they puff away.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tTheo, how would you like to be my new
tpartner?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou already have a partner Mr. Kastle.
tSheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car
tpulls out of the driveway.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tI think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I
tthink he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls
tout a shiny gold credit card and holds it
tin front of Sheila.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tHere, Bunny. Why don't you two go and do
tsomething fun tonight, on me. Sheila is
tlured to the scent of the plastic like a
tjunkie to a fix.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tOne thing, stay away from the lanes. If
tJunior sees you two together, he'll
tswallow his tongue.
tShe reaches for the card and Kastle
tsnatches it away from her with a chortle.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tWhat did I say?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tDon't go near the bowling alley.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tt(enunciating clearly)
tBowling "Center"!

Kastle hands her the card and heads into the house.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tIt wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in
tdanger, would it?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tNope, I couldn't care less.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhy should I help that old fuck.

<b>ttSHEILA

tYeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tZip.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tAnd besides, it's probably too late,

<b>ttTHEO

tWay too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.

tToo late for what?

She turns away.

</b>tNothing.

</b>tAre you fucking with me Sheila? Is

tseems to be trying to tell Theo, but is
tunable.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tt(faltering)
tI can't tell you, Theo.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhy not?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI saw your eyes when you hit that guy

tTheo takes Sheila by the shoulders.

<b>ttTHEO

tTell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of?
tSheila shakes her head.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI'm afraid you'll hurt him.

Sid and Breeze's car sits in front of Buzz's house. 8-track
opera PLAYS on the car stereo. A man screams and glass
smashes.

<b>INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE
</b>
P.O.V. shot running desperately through the house, knocking
things over, smashing things. We HEAR Buzz screaming in
terror. The scream is cut off. With a THUD, the camera falls
over and hits the floor. The golf ball rolls slowly into
view, and stops. Footsteps recede, a door slams, and a car
drives away.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>62     EXT. MILES 'O' LANES - NIGHTttt   62
</b>
Theo and Sheila walk her Vespa up to the darkened alley. Theo
is wearing his own clothes again. The SOUND of a lone bowler
is heard. Theo straps on his wristbrace. Sheila pulls out
keys.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tThese open the back door. Don't let him
tcatch you behind the machines; if he
tdoes, you're trapped. I'll meet you at
tthe bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila
tgrabs his arm.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tYou don't have to do this. We could just
tcut out of here, go to Akron,  or
tanywhere else.

<b>ttTHEO

tI'll be at the bridge.

<b>63     INT. MILES 'O' LANEStttt 63
</b>
Theo snakes his way along the rows of pin machines, towards
the only light source - lane six. As he leans in to peer
through the machine, a ball EXPLODES into the pins. Junior,
wearing his elaborate bowling claw, is working himself into a
sweaty froth. Junior picks up his ball and sends it CRASHING
into the pins.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tKnock-knock.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tt(stops and looks around)
tWho's there?

Theo remains silent.

tKnock-knock.

<b>ttTHEO

Junior walks towards Theo.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tJunior.

Theo remains silent.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b><b>tJUNIOR!
</b>tt(boiling)
tYou're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm
tgoing to have to hurt you. Theo and
tJunior circle one another.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tYou shouldn't touch her.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tNo, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tNobody touches her. Except me. I touch
ther. Sheila told me you played bouncy-
tbouncy with her.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhat did your dad tell you to do to Buzz?
tTheo scrambles up the lane on hands and
tknees. Junior catches him, grabbing his
tankles.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tHe told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I
tlike games.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(struggling to get away)
tWhat did you do to Buzz?

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tYou played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so
tI'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.
tt(he grabs Theo's throat)

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(hoarsely)
tI don't want to play.

Theo stretches to get a nearby ball, but just can't reach it,
by millimeters.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tTo play, I press my fingers on a throat
tlike this...
tt(he presses tighter on Theo's
tt windpipe)
t...and then the mans face would go blue
tand I should keep pressing...
tt(Theo's face goes pale blue)
t...and I did and then he stopped moving
tand he didn't play anymore after that.
tTheo bends back a finger on Junior's
thand. Junior lets out a HOWL of pain and
treleases Theo's neck. Theo GASPS for air.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tYou didn't play fair.
tt(stands up)
tYou were almost blue.

Theo gets his fingers in a bowling ball and brings it up to
bash Junior in the head.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tGo ahead Theo, I saw you on TV. I'm your
tbiggest fan. Junior offers Theo his
tunprotected head.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tt(yelling)
tCome on Theo, GIVE ME YOUR AUTOGRAPH!

Theo bashes Junior in the head with the ball. It bounces off
Junior's head like a Nerf ball and rolls down the alley.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tThank you, Mr. Skinner! Thank you!

Theo desperately, but fruitlessly tries to get away. As he
crawls over the ball return trough, Junior puts his foot on
Theo's head.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tI can have her,you know.
tt(looks around and whispers)
tShe's not my real sister.
tt(he flashes a lecherous smile)
tt THEO'S POV A ball pops up at
tt the far end of the return and
tt TRUNDLES rapidly towards Theo.
tt The ball hits Theo's face with
tt a POW. BLACK OUT We HEAR
tt "Raindrops Keep Falling On My
tt Head." THEO'S BOWLING SHOE
tt ATTIRED FEET Being dragged
tt down the lane. Theo comes to
tt and looks down his body to see
tt the empty lane. He looks up to
tt see Junior pulling him towards
tt the pin reset machine. The cut
tt on Theo's forehead bleeds down
tt the side of his face.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tt(muttering)
tLubrication.

<b>MACHINE NUMBER 6
</b>
Junior pulls the dazed Theo into the pin-reset machine and
positions him under the pins. As Junior prepares the
machinery, a control cable on his claw becomes fouled. Junior
begins to thrash about as he tries to disentangle himself and
his malfunctioning arm. Theo rolls away as Junior's flailing
releases the machine. It comes slamming down on Junior just
as Theo slips out of harm's way. He gets up and staggers away
from the machine. Junior's HOWL echoes across the lanes. His
twitching feet protrude from the maw of the device. Lane six
goes dark. Theo limps up the lane.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>64     EXT. BRIDGEttttt64

Theo drives up to the erect draw-bridge. He stops and gets
out. The night is silent.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(loud whisper)
tSheila! Where are you?

Sheila pops out of the bushes and walks towards Theo.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(angry)
tYou told Junior that we did it.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tIt?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tIt. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to
tsqueeze my fucking head off. What did you
tsay to him?
tWhen they reach each other, they stop.
tSheila seems to weigh her answer.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI told him you were my boyfriend.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(very pissed off)
tWhat the hell did you go doing that for
tSheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWe would have sooner or later.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tOh great! He tried to kill me! You knew
the would go off if he thought I fooled
taround with you.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tDid you - kill him?

Theo paces up and down in front of the upright bridge.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tHow do you get this thing down?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tTell me what happened Theo.

Theo backs Sheila towards the bridge control booth.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(glares at Sheila)
tYou wanted me to kill him, didn't you?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tt(in shock)
tIf he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tHe's dead Sheila.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI feel sick.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou should.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tAre you sure he's dead?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI didn't stop to take his pulse.

Theo boosts Sheila up the ladder to the control booth. The
hydraulic machinery of the bridge heaves into motion and the
bridge begins to lower. Theo walks over to his car. Sheila
jumps down from the bridge control booth and follows him.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWhere are you going?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI think your brother may have already
tgotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tCan I come with you?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI did your dirty work for you Sheila, now
tfuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila
tstanding alone. She watches his car
trecede with a thoughtful expression, then
tturns on her heel.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>65     INT. THEO'S CAR - NIGHTtttt    65
</b>
Theo grips the steering wheel with white knuckles. He nods
off at the wheel, the roadway through his eyes wavering and
distorting. He hits himself in the face in an effort to keep
himself awake.

<b>66     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE - NIGHTMAREttt  66
</b>
The house is dark except for a light coming from the closed
bathroom door. Theo cautiously makes his way to the door.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(whispers)
tBuzz? You alright?

WATER is running inside. Theo twists the doorknob and opens
the door with a jolt. Junior lunges out of the dark, mangled
and bloody with bowling pins sticking out of his chest.

<b>ttJUNIOR
</b>tDon't you KNOCK?

Theo SLAMS the door shut.

<b>67     EXT. BUZZ'S HOUSE - DAWNtttt   67
</b>
Theo jerks awake. His car is parked by the Fazeli house. It
is a clear, blustery day.
A gust of wind pulls the screen door open, then SLAMS it
shut. He gets out of the car and walks unsteadily towards the
house.

<b>68     INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOMttt 68
</b>
Theo walks into the house. The place is completely trashed.
Theo picks up a golf ball from the floor. He makes his way to
the bathroom door and slowly turns the knob; then pulls back.
He picks up a nearby bowling ball and holds it over his head
as he reaches for the doorknob. This time, he thrusts the
door open. The bathroom is empty. Relieved, he cradles the
ball in his arms.

<b>ttBALL
</b>tThick crimson red fluid trickles down his
tforearm, dripping off his elbow.
tHorrified, he pulls his fingers out of
tthe ball. Blood streams out of the three
tfinger holes. He drops the ball to the
tfloor. He goes into the bathroom and
tturns on the sink faucets.

<b>INT. BUZZ'S HOUSE, BATHROOM
</b>
Water runs as Theo manically washes the blood from his hands
and arms. He rinses the blood from the holes of his ball and
looks up to the mirror. "NOK NOK" is smeared in blood across
his reflection.

<b>69     EXT. 7-ELEVEN PHONE BOOTH - DAYttt69

<b>ttTHEO

<b>ttGRACE
</b>tYou sure you're OK Teddy? You're not

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI gotta go. Love ya mom.

Theo hangs up the phone. Alfie shuffles over.

<b>ttALFIE
</b>tDid you hear about that bowler who got
tsmeared? I saw them pull a body bag out
tof the alley. I heard he was kacked but
tgood. They had to take apart the pin

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(stunned)
tThe pin machine?

<b>ttALFIE
</b>tJust like Junior did the last time; lane
tsix. All's I know is it's gonna be a

tshades, flips up his collar and skulks
taway.

<b>70     EXT. MILES 'O' LANEStttt 70
</b>
Theo pulls into the parking lot. The place is cordoned off
with day-glo yellow emergency tape printed with "Bowling
Police - Do Not Cross". A black bowling police van, its blue
light spinning, is parked in front. Bowling cops herd dwarfs
and customers into the van. Mothers and daughters mill around
behind the yellow tape. A group of little people brandish
"Right to Work" signs. Theo gets out of his car. The crowd
moves in as Kastle, hands cuffed behind him, emerges from the
door.

<b>ttLITTLE GIRL
</b>tThere he is!

Camera flashes POP all over the place. Two black-jacketed
bowling cops step out behind him. They are Sid and Breeze.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tBowling police, step back, give him room.

<b>ttSID
</b>tNothing going on here, everybody stand

tfront of them, holding her ball.

<b>ttLITTLE GIRL

tanything bad.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tThank-you, sweetheart.

tSee that you pinheads! Character witness.

tThey're all character witnesses!
tt(he sees Theo)
tThanks to Buzz Fazeli, bowling is dead in
tthis town! He KILLED it! The two officers
thustle Kastle towards the van. Theo steps
tout in front of him.

<b>ttKASTLE

tYou fool, we could have done great things
ttogether!

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhere's Junior?

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tHe killed your stoolie embezzler father,

tand yells over his shoulder.

<b>ttKASTLE
</b>tt(shouting)
tLock your daughters up, ladies! Junior's

ta cacophony of screams and scatter for
ttheir cars. The BP cops hoist Kastle into
tthe back of the van. Sid slams the doors
tshut. The van screeches off, sirens
twailing. Sid and Breeze walk up to Theo.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tSorry about your loss.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(shaking his head)
tI should've pegged you guys for bowling
tdicks from day one.

<b>ttSID

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tSo, Buzz was stooling for you guys.

<b>ttSID
</b>tYou call it stooling, we call it

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tDid you know you were parked in the
thandicap space?

<b>ttSID
</b>tKastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.

Theo gets into his car and starts the engine. Sid and Breeze
poke their heads in the windows.

<b>ttSID
</b>tShe told us you went after Junior to save
tyour old man's hide. You got some balls
tgoin' after that psycho.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tOnly problem is, you didn't put his

<b>ttSID
</b>tThink he bought it?

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tI'd buy it!

Sid chews his lip worriedly.

<b>71     INT. THEO'S CAR - AFTERNOONtttt71

Theo nods off for a second and then snaps back. His eyes seem
hypnotized by the lines on the road which seem to swim and
undulate unnaturally. He nods again. And snaps again.

<b>72     EXT. PARKING FIELD - TWILIGHTttt  72
</b>
Theo pulls up to the old party spot and gets out. He walks
over the dunes and towards the beached station wagon. A huge
flame rises down the beach. A woman is visible in its light,
tossing objects into the fire. Theo walks towards her.

<b>EXT. BEACH, BONFIRE
</b>
Sheila is stripping Barbie and Ken dolls and tossing them
onto the pyre. Each one goes up in an exaggerated  WHOOSH of
flames. She notices Theo when he steps into the light.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tOnce my father walked in on me while I
twas making Barbie and Ken do it. He
tfreaked. I was seven. He took all my
tdolls away from me and cut them in half.
tHe gave the top halves back to

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tme. Then he made me watch him burn the
tbottom halves in the fireplace. Theo
tkneels down nearby and throws a Barbie
tonto the bonfire. It goes up with a
<b>tWHOOSH.
</b>
<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI can see Junior's face in the fire.

Theo puts his hand on Sheila's hand. She looks at him.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWhy did you come back?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhen I'm with you Sheila, I don't even
tthink about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in
this arms and kisses her passionately. She
tstops him and looks around nervously.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tIf Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI killed him once, I'll just have to kill
thim again.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tYou don't get two chances with Junior.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tAt least I'll die smiling.

Sheila pushes him over. He falls backwards, her on top.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tAnd you only get two chances with me.

Sheila yanks her shirt over her head and tosses it away.

<b>ttFIRE
</b>tThe shirt CRACKLES and burns.

She pulls Theo's head up to her breasts.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWhat's it gonna be, Theo?

A Barbie's breasts blister from the heat.

<b>ttTHEO & SHEILA
</b>tTheo bends Sheila backwards, down on her

tyanks it over his head and off his body.
tSheila rubs her hands up Theo's back.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWhat's the plan, Theo?

A Ken back bubbles and melts. Theo lifts Sheila's back off
the sand and works her jeans down her legs.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tSay something, Theo. Give me something. A
tdoll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into
tSheila's eyes.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tPlan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C.
tBoth bodies throb and grind, their sandy
thands sliding over each others' sweaty
tskin.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tIt's gonna be you, Sheila.

They humpty-hump to the beat of "Scientist's"
'DEMATERIALIZE.' We hear Theo and Sheila's stereophonic
MOANING as a Barbie and a Ken doll collapse and vaporize from
the blazing heat.
We pan up through the flames, the MOANS increasing in volume
and intensity as they reach the you-know-what-we've-all-been-
waiting-for.

<b>73     EXT. CEMETERY - DAYtttt  73
</b>
A coffin moves slowly forward as a solemn DIRGE plays. The
top is in the shape of a bowling alley with a miniature black
bowling ball inscribed with "The Faz" at the head. The
pallbearers; Theo, Breeze, Sid, Tina, and two other bowlers
place the coffin on poles above the grave. A rotund priest
sprinkles holy water. Sheila stands next to Theo, crying.
(more)

Theo wears a glazed look. The priest clears his throat with a
loud AHEM.

<b>ttPRIEST
</b>tt(with pomp and vigor)
tBowling!
tt(pauses to reflect)
tBowling is a little like faith. Every now
tand then, we are blessed with the ability
tand strength to send a full roller down..
tt(makes bowling gesture)
t...and scatter those babies like nobody's
tbusiness. And every now and then we end
tup in the gutter.
tt(pauses and gets glum)
tBuzz Fazeli found himself in the gutter
tof life. Trapped in hook alley, throwing
tnothing balls. But before he left us for
tthat pie alley in the clouds, he pulled
thimself out of that gutter.
tBuzz Fazeli died cleaning up the sport of
tbowling. Now he lies at peace alongside
this lane brothers here in Bowlers' Field.
tt(makes sign of the cross)
tHe died so that we could bowl - with
tdignity. Millie, decked out in mourning
tblack, lets out a wail, steps up and
tthrows a bouquet of flowers onto the
tcoffin.

<b>ttMILLIE
</b>tt(sniffles)
tI forgive you Buzz.

Sid leans over to Theo.

<b>ttSID
</b>tt(in loud whisper)
tThe Faz sure took care a her.
tt(points to Millie, does the
tt cash rub with fingers)
tBreeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to
tsuppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep
ta straight face - elbows him. Sid and
tBreeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls
tan orange whip out of a paper bag and
tcarefully places it on the coffin lid.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tNectar of the bowling gods, Faz.

<b>ttSID
</b>tSee ya 'round Faz.

Tina steps up to the grave with a handful of papers.

<b>ttTINA
</b>tThese are all your perfect games.
tt(she drops scoresheets onto the
tt coffin)
tBowl with God, Buzz.

Mourners sniff and cry. The coffin starts descending into the
ground. A stiff breeze scatters the scoresheets. Sheila
nudges Theo who approaches and tosses a handful of soil into
the grave.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tMaybe you were right Buzz. Maybe I did
tjust come here to take it out on
tsomebody. But, I had to find my father...
tThe muffled BEEPING of "Raindrops Keep
tFalling On My Head" begins playing from
tinside the coffin. Theo's body jolts. He
truns after Sheila who is walking towards
ther scooter.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tBuzz is alive, Sheila.

The two sleazeballs gaze surreptitiously at him as they walk
towards their car. Theo grabs Sheila's jacket.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tTheo, Buzz is dead.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI didn't come this far to bury a guy
tthat's not my dad. He owes me.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tt(bitterly)
tBack to plan A. The vicious cycle all
tover again. Theo lets go of Sheila.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI've been trapped by Miles Kastle my
twhole life. She walks over to her
tscooter, and mounts it.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tNow he's the one who's locked up and I'm
tthe one who's free. If I gotta do this
talone, I might as well start now. She
trevs up and peals out.

As Sid and Breeze walk up to their car, Theo catches up with
them.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhy is Junior's watch in that coffin?
tSomething stinks around here.

<b>ttSID
</b>tYour time is up, busyboy.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWho identified the body?

<b>ttSID
</b>tThe body was identified along proper
tBowling Congress guidelines for
tprocessing a bowling related fatality.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm the next of kin. I should've seen
thim.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tAfter we ID, we bury the body. Case and
tcasket closed.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou tried to make it look like Junior
ttrashed his place. Junior's underground
tin that coffin you dicks put him in.

<b>ttBREEZE
</b>tIt's splitsville for you.

Sid and Breeze back away from Theo.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou faked my dad's murder. You used him!
tWhere is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze
taround their car. He catches Sid and
tgrabs the middle fingers on his right
thand. Sid howls.

<b>ttSID
</b>tOw! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back
ton the planks in a week! Show him Breeze!
tBreeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler"
tfrom his pocket. The headline reads "RUB
<b>tOUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM
</b>tKINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.

<b>ttSID
</b>tIt's official, you're an orphan.

Happy now, busyboy? Theo stares at the newspaper. He lets
Sid's fingers drop.

<b>75     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAYtttt   75
</b>
Sheila speeds along, her Vespa maxing out at 30 mph. From
behind her we see Theo's car approaching rapidly. He pulls up
beside her.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(shouting and pointing
tt tfrantically)
tWhat makes you think you know me so well
tthat you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tWho said anything about an ultimatum? You
twant to find your father? Get a shovel
tand start digging. Hurry up, he's
tprobably in Purgatory by now. Sheila
tmakes a pathetic attempt to speed away
tfrom Theo. He moves up beside her again.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou're really pissing me off.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I
tsaid I'd do. What the hell are you doing?
tWhat about your word?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tMy word is good, and it'll always be

<b>ttSHEILA

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tFuck plan C!

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tYour word is so good, you're never gonna

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou think I'm dumping you to get back
tinto bowling. Well who's dumping who?

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tI'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tSez you!

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tSuck my dick!

She speeds ahead.

<b>76     EXT. HIGHWAYtttt         76
</b>
Theo THUNDERS along in his car. He listens to his SONG over
the stereo. Theo digs into his pocket and pulls out the golf
ball from Buzz's house.

<b>77     GOLF BALLttttt  77
</b>
The logo on the ball reads "PARADISE."

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tParadise.

The white ball fills the frame.

<b>ttTHEO (OS)
</b>tt(whispers to himself)
tParadise. Hmmmm

The camera pulls back from the ball to reveal:

<b>78     INT. TROPICAL 7-ELEVEN - DAYttt   78
</b>
Theo standing in flowery long Bermuda shorts, matching
airbrush Luau shirt and 7-11 shades. The woman behind the
counter looks like Alfie's twin. (It's actually Alfie in
drag.) It's the same store as before, only with a tropical
motif. Instead of bowling magazines on the rack, there's Mini-
Golf Digest. ALFREDA examines the ball at arm's length,
through her bifocals.

<b>ttALFREDA
</b>tYou a mini-golfer?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tNope.

<b>ttALFREDA
</b>tParadise, huh? Might be one of the new
tputt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to
tleave.

<b>ttALFREDA
</b>tCan I get you something for the road?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou have orange whips?

<b>ttALFREDA
</b>tOrange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tNo. I'm from Akron.

<b>79     EXT. BILLBOARD - DAYtttt 79
</b>
The billboard fills the frame. It reads "Paradise Putt-Putt",
and underneath: "A heavenly experience." A motorized cheesy-
looking smiling dwarf-angel swings a golden club.

<b>EXT. MINI-GOLF COURSE
</b>
Miniature golf obstacles are bathed in the light of the
setting sun. The camera passes a huge cement centaur
surrounded by astro-carpeting.

<b>ttWOMAN (OS)
</b>tI just hold it loosely with both hands?

<b>ttMAN (OS)
</b>tThat's right, sugar, find the grip that's
tright for you. Then grasp firmly.
tThe camera weaves past a five foot pink
twhale with a gaping green mouth leading
tonto a mini-green.

<b>ttWOMAN (OS)
</b>tGrasp firmly. Then what?

<b>ttMAN (OS)
</b>tLine up where you want it.

<b>ttWOMAN (OS)
</b>tYeah.

<b>ttMAN (OS)
</b>tNow swing it out a little to the right...

<b>ttWOMAN (OS)
</b>tLike this?

<b>ttMAN (OS)
</b>tNo, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle
tstroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead,
tnow, honey - stroke. As the camera comes
taround the side of the whale, we see an
telderly man in a fire hydrant red sports
tcoat and white slacks hunched over a
tdiminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is
tto the camera and he is wearing a
tbaseball cap with a plastic halo attached
tto it.

<b>ttWOMAN
</b>tStrokin'. Here goes nothin'.

She swings a club, sending a golf ball puttering into a cup.

<b>ttMAN
</b>tHole in one! You're the queen of stroke!

<b>ttWOMAN
</b>tYippy!

Theo strides towards the couple. The man under the halo is
(more)

Buzz. He raises the club at the approaching Theo, keeping the
woman in front of him as a shield. The front of Buzz's cap
reads "I'm No Angel."

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tGet away from me!

<b>ttWOMAN
</b>tWho the hell are you?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tHi Dad.

<b>ttWOMAN
</b>tDad? You said you was single.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tWe ain't married no more.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tHe says that to all his wives.

As she tries to wiggle away from him, the club conks Buzz on
the noodle, squishing his halo.

<b>ttWOMAN
</b>tt(freeing herself - to Buzz)
tGeez Maynard, is he telling the truth?

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tDon't pay him any mind, sweetheart.

<b>ttWOMAN
</b>tYou're a nice guy, Maynard, but if you
tgot two wives - I ain't into no
tpolybigamy. Buzz is silent. He takes the
tclub out of her hand. She steps away -
tstartled - then turns and jogs away. Buzz
tthrows down his club in a fury.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tGoddam it! I was just about to make a
tlove connection. You sure got a way with
twomen. You show up, women get away.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(laughs)
tThe whole world thinks you're
tunderground.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI am underground.

Buzz removes his damaged cap.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tIt could just as easily have been me in
tthat box.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI told you to get lost. You forced
tyourself into this mess, so the mess
taccommodated you.
tBuzz straightens out and carefully
tremolds the bent out of shape halo.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tWhat about bowling?

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(takes a practice swing)
tBowling died for me years ago. Besides,
tI'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tYou're a scumbag.

Buzz pats his hair down and slips the cap back on his head.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI'm a live scumbag.

Theo digs into his pocket and retrieves the golf ball. He
tosses it to Buzz.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tNice knowing you, dad.

Theo turns and walks towards his car. Buzz pauses and walks
after him.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tSo, eh, you never saw me. Right?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI never saw you.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tThanks, kid.
tt(pause)
tWhere are you goin' now?

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI'm goin' straight. No more short cuts.
tTheo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the
topen window.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tListen, if straight doesn't work out, you
tcome work for me.
tt(hands Theo his card)
tJust make sure nobody's following you.
tBuzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of
tthe sunset, his halo bouncing in the
tbreeze.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tI didn't mean that stuff I said. I was
ttrying to keep you out of this muddle.
tI'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh,
tand by the way, I made a call for you
tbefore I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his
tcard and scrawl on the back with a gold
tpen.

<b>ttBUZZ
</b>tt(hands the card back)
tYou give Ed Klein of the American Bowling
tCongress a call.
tt(taps the card)
tTell him your Maynard's boy. He's
texpecting you, and he owes me. He'll
tgetcha back in like Flynn.
tt(pats Theo's cheek)
tDon't say I never gave you nothing.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tt(cracks a half smile)
tSee ya 'round Maynard.

Buzz backs away from the car as Theo peels out in reverse.
Buzz stands and watches as Theo pulls away.

<b>80     EXT. MILES 'O' LANES PARKING LOT - DAYtt   80
</b>
The sign has been changed to "SHEILA'S ALLEY." A sparkling
new badass super-chromed Vespa is parked in the handicap
zone. The Barbie and Ken dolls are wired to the headlamp.
They look incredibly worse for the wear. A parking ticket is
nestled between them. Theo's car pulls in nearby.

<b>81     INT. SHEILA'S ALLEYtttt  81
</b>
Theo walks through the doors and into the alley packed with
serious bowling types. As he walks towards the back of the
alley, several bowlers stop bowling and stare at him in awe.

<b>ttLUNA
</b>tTheo! Howya doin'?

Theo walks on. Others greet the conquering hero.

<b>ttBOWLER
</b>tTheo! Hey, Theo's back!

<b>ttTINA
</b>tHello there, stranger.

<b>ttLITTLE GIRL
</b>tt(still crying)
tWaaaaaaaaaaah!

At the far end, we see Sheila, dressed in a fitted jogging
suit, bowling alone on her lane. Bowlers stop and hold their
balls at their sides. Sheila notices the whole alley is
silent. Theo steps up to the lane, bowling ball bag in hand.
As he straps on his wristbrace he peers down the lane and
sees a seven-ten split; mule ears.

<b>ttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>82     BLACKNESSttttt  82
</b>
A loud ZIP and light spills in through three holes. Three
fingers approach the holes, blocking out the light once more.
With a POP, the fingers leave the holes and the ball hits the
lane with a KLUNK.

<b>LANE
</b>
The camera races towards the pins along the maple boards.

<b>PINS
</b>
Two pins loom in the foreground, one at each edge of the
screen. The ball slams into the right hand pin in super slow
motion with a ROAR. Theo's eyes slowly close. The pin lifts
and hurtles slowly across the frame towards its unsuspecting
fellow pin. Theo's eyes open. With a reverberating EXPLOSION,
the pin is taken out.

<b>83     INT. SHEILA'S ALLEY, THEO & SHEILAtt       83
</b>
Theo turns to Sheila and takes her in his arms.

<b>ttSHEILA

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI am a professional man.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tt(touches his lips)
tLips still for sale?

<b>ttTHEO

tYou bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw
tin the tongue.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tt(she pulls away, slightly)
tCan you change something this big?

She pulls out a hundred dollar bill.

<b>ttTHEO
</b>tI don't know.

Sheila stuffs the bill down Theo's pants.

<b>ttSHEILA
</b>tYou'll owe me.

They smooch big time. One by one, balls drop to the lanes
again and pins start CRASHING.

<b>tttt        DISSOLVE TO:

Alfie, hands trembling, lays a tiny wreath on Buzz Fazeli's
grave. The headstone reads, "Maynard 'Buzz' Fazeli 'I Never
Met A Bowler I Didn't Like.'" A muffled watch beeper CHIMES
"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head." The camera pulls up to
show ten headstones laid out in a bowling pin set-up with
Buzz's at the head.

<b>tttt        DISSOLVE TO:

Buzz's silhouette against an orange sunburst sky. He wears
his halo hat. He takes a beautiful PGA-perfect slow motion
fluid golf swing, connecting with a THWAP. As he follows
through, divots of turf dance at his feet. MUSIC swells. He
holds the afterswing pose and gazes after the ball, off into
the distance.
