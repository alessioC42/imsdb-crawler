</b><b>t"THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED"
</b>
<b>tttt    COLD OPENING
</b>
<b>tEXT. PARIS CIRCUS - NIGHT
</b>
tThe normal activity and excitement of showtime around the 
tcircus is in evidence where we see the half dark street and 
talley directly adjacent to the circus tent which (in Paris 
tis an enclosure)... the animals, the midgets, the people and 
tthe roustabouts moving with a fixed speed and getting faster 
tas we now know showtime is momentarily due.

tWe MOVE TOWARD the action, slowly but definitely picking up 
tSOUNDS and actions of the busy people as we go.

<b>tttttt    STRAIGHT CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. CIRCUS - FRONT OF CIRCUS - PEOPLE ENTERING - NIGHT
</b>
tWe see barkers, children, people, pushing... buying tickets, 
thats, candy... SOUNDS of children laughing, MUSIC playing 
tfrom o.s. within the tent area... and we...

<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. BACK OF CIRCUS - NIGHT
</b>
tA continuation of the animals, trainers, clowns INTERCUT 
twith the action of the circus customers jamming the 
tentranceway to get in... (complimented CUTS from backstage 
tto out front... building to the final crescendo... as we see 
tthe alley empty and clear out vs. the front area clearing 
tand also becoming empty.)

<b>ttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CIRCUS PROPER - NIGHT
</b>
tThe fully dressed orchestra playing the oncoming people to 
ttheir respective seats as we PAN ALONG the happy faces and 
texcited children... DOWN and BACK within the circus backstage 
tand SLOWLY COME TO A STOP OUTSIDE: "CLOWN ALLEY".

<b>tCLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
tThe heartbeat of any circus... The long row of unkempt, yet 
tbeautifully neat trunks where the clowns make up, with many 
tof the clowns just coming in and setting their clothes and 
tthings around their own little areas... midgets running and 
tplaying, like the little children they are about to 
tentertain... MUSIC is in the deep background... as we COME 
tTO A STOP at the large trunk with the letters clearly printed 
<b>t...'GUSTAV - EUROPE'S PREMIER CLOWN."
</b>
tWe PULL BACK and AWAY from the lettering on the trunk and 
tREVEAL the face of a gentle but drawn man, a man whose body 
tand movements indicate he has been at this for a long time.  
tAs he sits, the little midgets run close to see what they 
tcan do to help; one pulls the chair for him to sit on; another 
tbrings a hot cup of coffee; another takes his coat and hangs 
tin on the hattree, adjacent to his trunk... as we PUSH PAST 
tHIM to introduce the other clowns... some half made up, others 
tfinishing their make-up... and some just sitting and rapping 
ttogether, smoking, drinking coffee, waiting for showtime... 
tand in the very distant b.g., almost against the wall of 
tclown alley, we see the trunk and the body of a "CLOWN" in 
tsilhouette... we CRAWL TOWARDS the body and the trunk... and 
tCOME TO A STOP... HOLDING FULL FRAME.  The clown, already 
tmade-up and dressed in his tramp outfit, has his head in his 
thands, leaning down on the trunk table top, a depressed and 
tsad looking hulk of a man... an o.s. voice:

<b>tttt  MIDGET
</b>ttCoffee?  It's nice and hot.

tThe MIDGET slides the cup in front of the clown's face... as 
the picks up his head and smiles and nods yes... he sips the 
tcoffee and we see the clown is HELMUT DORQUE (pronounced 
tDoork).

tHe is a depressed and very unhappy clown... the frown on his 
tface shows years of knocking around... plus fear that those 
tyears are now over.  From o.s. we HEAR the SOUND of a small 
tair horn being blown and carried by one of the midgets.  He 
tis yelling through an old megaphone.

<b>tttt  MIDGET
</b>tt15 Minutes to circus... 15 minutes 
ttto circus.

tUpon hearing this, "Clown Alley" really gets busy... all the 
tclowns get up and put their last minute touches together... 
ttouching up their make-ups... getting their coats and props 
ttogether... and as they get themselves up and ready, they 
texit the clown alley area and start for the arena.  The last 
tone to go is Helmut, lingering behind intentionally as we:

<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CIRCUS ARENA - CLOSEUP RINGMASTER - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttt  RINGMASTER
</b>ttLadies and gentlemen, we proudly 
ttpresent... "The Clowns"!

<b>tINT. CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
tHelmut hangs back until the very last clown exits Clown Alley, 
tas we:

<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CIRCUS PROPER - NIGHT
</b>
tThe MUSIC is really going strong... and the clowns come on 
tlike all forty.  They explode in the ring... doing all their 
tbits and pieces which ultimately brings them back to the 
tentrance area they just came from and they make the "West 
tPoint" arch for the TIMPANI DRUM ROLL and the grand entrance 
tof "Gustav" the Great.

<b>tCLOSER SHOT
</b>
t"Gustav" makes his famous comedy walk into the tent with the 
tlongest pair of tails ever seen (at least 75 feet long) and 
tat the end holding them from dragging on the floor is Helmut, 
tthe "Tramp Clown".

<b>tWIDER SHOT
</b>
tWe see Gustav taking the applause, and it is tremendous.  He 
tstops center of the ring, but Helmut keeps walking and doesn't 
tsee the post in front of him as he walks around the post, 
tstill holding the tails and goes on his butt, pulling Gustav 
tdown as well.  The audience screams with laughter, believing 
tthis all part of the act, as we:

<b>ttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
tAll the clowns are sitting around their respective trunks 
tand there is a sense of gloom permeating the air, as Gustav 
tand MR. SCHMIDT pace back and forth behind Helmut, both going 
tat him unmercifully.

<b>tttt  MR SCHMIDT
</b>ttt(in the middle of his 
ttttirade)
ttNot to mention how unprofessional 
ttthat was...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttBut it was an accident...

<b>tttt  GUSTAV
</b>ttOh, sure it was... A very well planned 
ttand calculated accident!

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI swear to you... it was an accident!

tGustav stops and grabs Schmidt's arm, and with a threatening, 
tpointing finger...

<b>tttt  GUSTAV
</b>ttI don't want to hear any more...  
ttYou will get me another stooge. I 
ttdon't want this man!!

<b>tttt  SCHMIDT
</b>ttDon't get excited, Gustav, you shall 
tthave it.

<b>tttt  GUSTAV
</b>ttYou bet I will, or you shall have no 
ttshow.

tGustav walks away, sits at his trunk, starts taking his make-
tup off.

<b>tttt  SCHMIDT
</b>ttt(moving to Helmut's 
ttttrunk, leaning over 
tttinto Helmut's ear)
ttYou will run with the other clowns 
ttand that's all you will do... is 
ttthat clear?

tHelmut, shattered, nods his head yes.

<b>tttt  SCHMIDT
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttAnd if there is another one of your 
ttcute tricks... I promise you will do 
ttyour bits for the "Cats" while 
ttcleaning their cages!

tSchmidt walks away... leaving Helmut stunned and shocked.  
tHelmut lifts his trunk cover, which opens on a hinge and 
tstays upright, as we SLOWLY CRAB AROUND to REVEAL the "One 
tSheets" glued to the inside of the trunk lid... as Helmut 
treaches for a towel to clean his face, we read:

<b>tt   RINGLING BROS. & BARNUM AND BAILEY
</b>
<b>tttt PRESENTS
</b>
<b>tt  THE WORLD'S GREATEST CLOWN "HELMUT"
</b>
<b>tttt SCHMIDT
</b>
tttt    From Germany

tThe one sheets are battered and torn and certainly appear to 
tbe many years old.  As we PAN the "Lid" to see them all, 
tHelmut's face is reflected in the mirror as we see the tears 
trolling down his face.  As we FREEZE FRAME, MUSIC hits for:

<b>tMAIN TITLES:
</b>
<b>tTHE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED
</b>
<b>tFOLLOWING CREDITS:
</b>
<b>tEXT. DESERTED STREET AND BISTRO - NIGHT
</b>
tHelmut, dejected and as sad as any man could be, strolls 
tdown the deserted street, alone.

<b>tINT. BISTRO
</b>
tHe comes to a small bistro and walks in... stands at the 
tbar.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttClause... give me a double whiskey 
ttwith beer chaser.

<b>tttt  CLAUSE
</b>ttt(who knows him)
ttYou won't get "Funny" out of a bottle.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttAnd you won't make a dime sticking 
ttyour nose in other people's business.

tClause pours the whiskey, and places the beer next to it; as 
tHelmut gulps the drink down and chases it with the beer from 
tthe bottle... we:

<b>tttttt    STRAIGHT CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tStanding at the window looking out is a beautiful WOMAN, 
tsimply dressed, no make-up and clean; she has the look of a 
twoman who has just bathed and one could almost smell the 
tfragrance of bath oil on her body.  She is tense and 
tconcerned.

tShe sees something and moves toward the door and opens it.  
tThere is a beat and finally the o.s. SOUNDS of feet scuffling 
tget to the door.  It is Helmut, fairly crocked at this point.

<b>tttt  ADA
</b>ttHelmut, darling, are you all right?

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(nastily)
ttDo I look like I'm not all right?

<b>tttt  ADA
</b>ttI was so worried about you...  Your 
ttdinner is cold and I couldn't imagine 
ttwhat happened to you...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttWere you really worried about me or 
ttyour stupid dinner was getting cold?

tAda is hurt by this, but knows something is really chewing 
taway at him... and deals with it even more tenderly, which 
tonly digs in deeper on Helmut.

<b>tttt  ADA
</b>ttSweetheart, I care about you...  I 
ttlove you... I worry about you...  I 
ttcan't help those feelings...

tDuring the above Helmut is at the small bar in the living 
troom pouring another "blast" and gulps it down... he hears 
tthe words but tries to ignore them.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttIf there is anything I don't need 
ttright now... it's your super-
ttsentimentality...

tHe flops down in the armchair and stares straight ahead... 
tAgain, Ada is hurt by his blasting her, but she's wise enough 
tto know this isn't the man she loves... she has to get what's 
teating him out of there.

<b>tttt  ADA
</b>ttHelmut... what's tormenting your 
ttsoul?  Please let me help you... 
tttalk to me...  I don't care what it 
ttis... I love you...  I'm your 
ttfriend... you can trust me to 
ttunderstand...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI can't trust anybody... I don't 
ttknow how to trust anybody...

<b>tttt  ADA
</b>ttI'm not anybody!  I'm your wife!

tHelmut, hearing these words, looks up at her and sees the 
tbeauty in her eyes, and he is affected by this.  He stands 
tup and takes her in his arms... almost breaking her in two.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI'm sorry, my love... I'm so sorry...
ttYou're right!  You're not anybody.  
ttYou're my wife and I love you, too...
ttSo very much I just have no one to 
ttfight back at... I'm lost and alone,  
ttI can't handle the disgrace of 
ttfailure... the pain of being a has-
ttbeen is more than I can bear...

tAda knows now what's happened.

<b>tttt  ADA
</b>ttSchmidt again?  Gustav again?  When 
ttwill you learn they fear you and 
ttthey know how vulnerable you are 
ttnow...  if they can beat you down 
ttthen they needn't worry about you 
ttcoming back to haunt them.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttThey worry about me?  Don't be 
ttridiculous...  they just took the 
ttlast comic bit away from me... because 
ttof a silly accident...  I'm now down 
ttat the bottom, just a stooge assisting 
tta not-so-funny clown.

<b>tttt  ADA
</b>ttBut they can't take your talent 
ttaway...  That's your strongest force!

tWalking away from her, getting angry again...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttWhat the hell are you talking about?
ttWhat talent?  And if I had any it's 
ttbeing suffocated into nothing...  
ttAnd that's just what I am now...  
ttnothing... No one... just empty...  
tta prop to be used and mis-used...  
tthow does my great talent stand up to 
ttthose odds?

<b>tttt  ADA
</b>ttBy not quitting... You must fight!  
ttCreative survival is even more 
ttdifficult than human survival...  
ttYou must fight!!!

tHelmut gets quiet and listens, and it makes sense... Ada 
tknows she's got him now.

<b>tttt  ADA
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttGo to Schmidt... Force a 
ttconfrontation...  Don't let Gustav 
ttwin...  make Schmidt see what an 
ttinjustice they are imposing on you...  
ttPlease, my love, fight!  Make your 
ttworld better by fighting for it...  
ttYou can do it... I know you can...

tHelmut hears it all and it sounds so good and right.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI will go now and see Schmidt...
ttI will tell him I won't take any 
ttmore degradation... I will tell him 
ttI am a "clown" not a stooge...  A 
tt"clown"... A special person...  A 
ttspecial clown...

tAda happily gets his hat.

<b>tttt  ADA
</b>ttt(placing the hat on 
ttthis head)
ttGo, my love... Go and fight for what 
ttyou know is right... I will warm 
ttyour dinner and wait for you to come 
tthome.

tShe kisses him, opens the door for him and he goes.

<b>ttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. THE EMPTY CIRCUS - NIGHT
</b>
tThe low key light and the silence of the circus is almost 
tominous and a little frightening for Helmut as he walks across 
tthe empty arena... with a small light burning from up high.  
tAll the equipment is tied off.  Slight ANIMAL SOUNDS in the 
tdeep background... and the faintest SOUND of circus music is 
theard.  Helmut is now center of the main ring and stops and 
tlooks around.

<b>tHIS POV - THE EMPTY STANDS
</b>
<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tHis face tense, then eases as he looks around.

<b>tHIS POV
</b>
tThe stands are full, the lights come up, and the audience is 
tstanding, applauding thunderously!

<b>tMED. CLOSE - HELMUT
</b>
tIn his clown outfit bowing and acknowledging the ovation.

<b>tHIS POV - THE AUDIENCE
</b>
tas they stop applauding and sit down.

<b>tWIDE SHOT
</b>
tHelmut -- the chair and the trombone --

<b>tTHE TROMBONE PANTOMIME
</b>
tAs the completion of the "Trombone Pantomime" Helmut walks 
taway from the position he was in with the trombone and bows 
tand milks the crowd for reactions and as he bows the second 
ttime... WE SHIMMER:

<b>tttttttt  BACK TO:
</b>
<b>tCLOSE - HELMUT
</b>
tIn bowing position as he looks at the crowd.

<b>tHIS POV - THE EMPTY STANDS
</b>
<b>tCLOSE - HELMUT
</b>
tHis face shows signs of utter despair and dejection... the 
tdream is gone and the memory of what was really hurts deep 
tdown.  He looks around making sure he hasn't been noticed by 
tanyone and takes that deep sigh and strolls towards the back 
tof the circus tent area on his way to find Schmidt.

<b>tWIDE ANGLE
</b>
tTRUCK WITH HIM, HOLDING the many empty seats in the b.g. as 
the walks... trying to muster up the courage he's going to 
thave to call... something that has now become totally foreign 
tto him.

<b>tHIGH SHOT - THE EMPTY CIRCUS
</b>
tWe see Helmut as the tiny figure he feels like, walking out 
tof the tent area and into the backstage section.

<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tBACKSTAGE OFFICE AREA - NIGHT
</b>
tHelmut enters the section of the circus where Schmidt has 
this "Temp" office quarters.  It is a tent-like arrangement 
twith the canvas flap as his door and we see light streaming 
tfrom the half open canvas flap.

<b>tHIS POV - THE TENT OFFICE
</b>
tHelmut looks and sees a shadow of a body moving around in 
tthe tent office area and starts for it.

<b>tINT. TENT OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tSchmidt pacing up and down... thinking, as we PULL BACK to 
tsee Gustav seated in one of the fold-up chairs with a "I am 
twaiting" look on his face.

<b>tttt  SCHMIDT
</b>ttNaturally, I agree... Doork is a 
ttnuisance, but to just let him go 
ttseems a little unfair.

<b>tttt  GUSTAV
</b>ttSchmidt!  Don't make me put it on a 
tt"either him or me basis".

<b>tttt  SCHMIDT
</b>ttAll right... all right... I'll give 
tthim --

<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tOUTSIDE OFFICE TENT - HELMUT - NIGHT
</b>
tlistening.

<b>tttt  SCHMIDT (V.O.)
</b>tt-- his two weeks notice tomorrow. 
ttWill that satisfy you?

<b>tttt  GUSTAV (V.O.)
</b>ttPerfectly!!  Let's have a drink...

tHelmut drops his head, completely discouraged and saddened 
tby what he knows is a losing battle.  As he starts to walk 
taway we can HEAR the tinkling of glasses and the slight 
tlaughter of the two men as we watch Helmut slowly scuff his 
tway towards the backstage circus exit, as we:

tDISSOLVE (12-ft) HOLDING his walk over his limp body at bar.

<b>tINT. THE BAR - NIGHT
</b>
tHelmut has had more than a few and really looks beaten and 
tshoddy -- he waves for the bartender to bring another.

<b>tttt  CLAUSE
</b>ttt(pouring still another 
tttblast)
ttIt's your funeral.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(not too clearly)
ttA funeral is usually in order when 
ttsomeone dies.

tUp to now, we have no idea, whatever, as to the time (in 
thistory) we are indeed in Germany, but as Helmut downs another 
tblast we SLOWLY CREEP our CAMERA to include more of the bar 
tthan we have seen before and it includes pictures, framed, 
tof soldiers, arms interlocked (looking somewhat like summer 
tcamp stills), the German flag (1933 vintage / crisscrossed 
twith the Swastika), a large banner marked "Deutchland" Ober 
tAliss... and finally, the larger than life photograph of 
t"Hitler".  Helmut slowly CROSSES CAMERA as he takes another 
tdrink and starts spouting again.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttThe trouble with man today is that 
tthe takes everything for granted...  
tthe thinks things he's told to think...  
ttand accepts it! Just because we know 
ttmeanings of words we use them and we 
ttfool ourselves...  people should use 
ttthe dictionary more...  look up words 
ttlike good... bad... honest... loyal...
ttespecially loyal,  I know what loyal 
ttmeans, and I have always been that...  
ttbut does anyone care?  No!  Of course 
ttnot...  Only when it is expedient...  
ttWhen it isn't ---
ttt(he slashes his throat 
tttwith his finger)
tt--- ZIPPPP!  You're out!

tHelmut stops with his BACK TO CAMERA looking straight at 
t"Hitler" and screams:

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttAnd that goes for you too... Mine 
ttFuhrer...

tHe shoves his right arm up and out at the photograph of 
t"Hitler".

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>tt... you, too, are a fool.  You allow 
ttyourself to think you have "loyal" 
ttfollowers...  Ha!  Wait until they've 
tthad it with you...  You'll get 
ttyours... all the smiling, bowing, 
ttheel clicking idiots will shaft you 
tttoo.  And you will deserve it because 
ttif you allow people like Herr Schmidt 
ttto got about his business of lying, 
ttand cheating, and being disloyal, 
ttone day all the Schmidts in Germany 
ttwill turn on you and you will finish 
ttas the dumb little corporal you 
ttstarted as, and never know what hit 
ttyou...

tDuring the above dialogue, two S.S. men along with two Gestapo 
tmen walk into the bar and sit at a table unseen by Helmut, 
tand as they sit, Helmut continues:

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttHe really has to be stupid --
ttt(indicating Hitler)
ttI could help him by telling him about 
ttthe people he thinks are good 
ttGermans... Ha!

tThe two S.S. men and the two Gestapo men just happened to 
tstop in the pub, they can't really believe what they are 
thearing, and the two S.S. men make a move to get up and secure 
tHelmut.  The head Gestapo man nods to them to stay seated 
tand wait and listen.  Helmut continues his rave and gets 
tmore violent as he goes on.  Clause, the bartender, would 
tlove to tell him the Germans are there, but chooses to go 
tabout his business.

tHelmut is really getting the effects of the booze now and is 
tbordering on flipping his lid, completely.

t(He does the stagger routine trying to get to the table on 
tthe other side of the bar furthest away from where the S.S.  
tmen and Gestapo men are sitting)... We play this for visual 
thumor, but at the same time showing just how swacked he is!!!  
tHelmut finally reaches the table he has been trying 
tdesperately to get to and falls into it, exhausted and 
temotionally drained.  He looks around at the few people who 
thave been watching him, most of which are frightened at what 
the has said, trying vainly to stay out of it.  Helmut catches 
tthe eyes of the four men (S.S. and Gestapo) just looking at 
thim.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(angrily)
ttWhat are you staring at?  Didn't you 
ttever see a man drink before?

tThe four men just stare at him with no answer.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttWhat's the matter?  Haven't you guys 
ttgot a sense of humor?  You must have!  
ttLook how you're dressed!  Grown men 
ttin their little soldier suits... And 
ttthe black coats and gloves... Like 
ttin a movie...

tHelmut gets up and walks over to their table... mumbling, 
tand staggering as he goes...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttReal cloak and dagger stuff...  Didn't 
ttyou Gestapo guys ever know that 
tteverybody can spot you a mile away?
ttt(leaning over and 
tttwhispering)
ttListen, if you really wanted to be 
ttunnoticed...  You should dress like 
ttplain people, then nobody would  
ttknow you... You might even wear straw 
tthats and shorts...

tHe hears this and gets hysterical laughing.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttStraw hats and shorts!!  That's funny!  
ttNow that's really funny, isn't it?  
ttStraw hats and shorts!

tThey just stare!

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttWell, isn't that funny?   Think of 
ttit...  That's funny!   Why don't you 
ttlaugh?

<b>tHELMUT'S POV - THE S.S. AND GESTAPO MEN
</b>
tThey are really staring now, hard to believe their ears and 
teyes.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(gets an idea)
ttI know why you're not laughing...  
ttBecause things you hear, you have to 
ttthink about... I'll show you something 
ttthat you'll laugh at because all 
ttyou'll have to do is watch...

<b>tDIRECTOR'S MEMO!!!    (INSERT CHAPLIN FOOTAGE)
</b>
tHelmut goes over to the bar, where a little man is standing 
tdrinking his beer.  Alongside of the beer is a small plate 
twith crackers and brown jam.  Helmut takes a comb out of his 
tpocket, dips it in the man's glass of beer, combs his hair 
tdown over one eye, takes a finger full of the brown jam and 
tmakes a shicklegruber mustache from it... and turns on the 
tfour men yelling:

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttVe vill conquer the world...  Heil 
ttme!  Heil me!  Heil me!

tHe screams the last "Heil" and collapses on the floor.  The 
tfour men get up and proceed to pick him up and carry him out 
tof the bar.  As they get to the doorway and exit we STAY 
ton... Ada who has just arrived to see them pick him up and 
tcarry him away.  She is shocked.  We STAY on a CLOSEUP OF 
tHER FACE showing the strain, pain and sadness as we:

<b>ttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:

tWe OPEN on the shiny black boots swinging the door open in 
tfront of him and as we PULL BACK we see Helmut seated in a 
tslumped position on the hard wood bench as we introduce the 
twearer of the black boots -- LT. REICHER -- he enters his 
toffice as we go with him... (Feather Edge Set)... he walks 
tbriskly to the desk where there are briefs and papers stacked 
thigh on his desk... he bellows, after looking at the top 
tfolder.

<b>tttt  REICHER
</b>ttSTEINER !!!!  Get in here!

tA frightened and spineless like corporal springs into his 
toffice and clicks his heels and screams.

</b>ttDo I see what I think I see here?

tThe corporal leans over the desk, and in order to see puts 
this hand on the desk to brace himself... Reicher smacks his 
tarm, knocking his face flat on the desk... he stays there 
twith his ass in the air, waiting for instructions.  Reicher 
tleans down putting his nose right to the corporal's nose.

<b>tttt  REICHER
</b>ttNever put your hands on my desk...  
ttis that clear?

tStill in the same position, the Corporal extends his arm for 
ta heil Hitler, which is virtually impossible in the position 
the is in.

tThe Corporal rises and stands stiffer than ever...

ttNow tell me, is this brief correct?  
ttIs that prisoner, the drunk, the one 
ttthat impersonated the Fuehrer?

<b>tttt  CORPORAL
</b>ttYes sir!  It is!

tReicher paces behind his desk... the Corporal still stiff at 
tattention... waits and watches in mortal fear.

</b>ttt(to himself)
ttI get all the weirdos...  Alright, 
ttCorporal, send him in!

tThe corporal clicks his heels, thrilled that he can go.

<b>tttt  CORPORAL
</b>ttYes sir!!!!

tHe exits, and returns with Helmut and one more guard.  Helmut 
tstands in the doorway, frightened and unsure, Reicher still 
tpacing behind his desk feels Helmut's presence...

<b>tttt  REICHER
</b>ttAlright, come in, sit down!

tHelmut walks to the chair in front of Reicher's desk... The 
tspineless corporal moves towards the door... turns... and 
ttakes his position on the opposite side of the door that the 
tguard is standing at...

tReicher picks up the folder again, fingers through it.  As 
the looks through the folder, he looks at Helmut and looks 
tand fingers pages and the silence and the anxiety is getting 
tto Helmut as he sweats and waits.

tReicher is toying with him, and each time Reicher looks up 
tthe sick, little-boy smile crosses Helmut's face, hoping to 
tendear himself to this Prussian pig!

tReicher finally sits down beside his desk in a chair that 
tresembles a throne.  It is high and it looks down on Helmut.

t(Props:  This chair must be higher and taller than Helmut's 
tchair... for POV shots diminishing Helmut seated there.

tOn each attack of the word "why", Reicher creeps up closer

tAda walking as briskly as a woman can walk without running 
tand then her walk becomes a panic running, looking, sweating, 
tand the look on her face is evident that she is frightened 
tand close to shock... she gets to a train gate where she 
tsees the S.S. men pushing men through the gate to the train... 
tshe knows she is where she has to be... she approaches one 
tof the S.S. men...

tAda backs away from the gate, and stands to one side watching 
tthe prisoners being moved from the back of the huge truck 
tbacked up to the railway area... she is looking through the 
tiron bars (we SHOOT the bars holding depth of field snugly 
tso that the prisoners and the bars are in sharp focus)... we 
tmake QUICK CUTS between Ada and the prisoners exiting the 
thuge truck... as we see the change of expression on Ada's 
tface we know she sees what she's been looking for... Helmut... 
the is walking in a slow rhythm following a group of men who 
tlook equally as broken and sad as he looks... Ada yells 
tthrough the bars...

<b>tttt  ADA

tJust as she yells, the voice of an S.S. Man drowns out her 
tscream as he yells...

<b>tttt  S.S. MAN
</b>ttMove along... you swine... move...  
ttwe haven't got all day... move...  
ttmove... one-two-three-four --

tHis voice rings loudly in echo in the vast station it's as 
tthough he is timing his yells to each scream of hers... we 
tsee her mouth moving with the SOUND of the S.S. Man's voice 
tcoming from it... she is screaming Helmut... as the S.S. Man 
tscreams...

twith INTERCUTS of Ada, tears streaming down her face... with 
tCUTS of Helmut walking with his head down, embarrassed and 
tshattered...

tWe MOVE the CAMERA SLOWLY towards her, peering through the 
tbars of the huge gate... and as we MOVE, we HEAR the doors 
tof the train slamming... the whistle... and the slow start 
tof the locomotive moving the train out of the station... by 
tthe time we get to the (choker) of Ada... the train is almost 
tout of listening range... She drops her head, wipes her eyes 
twith her handkerchief, as we hear so.:

tDuring the above dialogue we see another S.S. Man closing

tthis "Pig", then down and up as though she were examining a

<b>tINT. THEIR APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tAda is sitting at the kitchen table, the table is empty, the 
tlight is low and we see the picture of a lonely heartbroken 
twoman, she has a small bowl of soup in front of her and the 
tspoon in her hand is doing nothing more than swirling the 
tsoup around in the bowl... she can't eat, which is evident 
tand as she swirls the spoon around, we MOVE IN SLOWLY and 
tinto the bowl of soup (choker)... and HOLD on the spoon in 
tthe bowl as we

<b>tttttt    STRAIGHT CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CAMP MESS HALL - INSERT - BOWL OF SLOP - DAY
</b>
tWe see wooden spoon doing exactly what Ada was doing, just 
tswirling the spoon around in what looks like dirty water 
twith a carrot in it, the bowl is chopped and cracked, the 
tspoon is old and almost white from use... the handle still 
tretains its wooden look... as we PULL BACK we see Helmut is 
tswirling the spoon in the slop... behind him is a Guard just 
twatching his actions... after a beat, the Guard taps Helmut 
ton the shoulder...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttTsk!  tsk!  tsk!  shame on you, 
ttDoork... shame...  don't you want to 
ttgrow big and strong like me?

tHelmut knows he's in trouble and just waits indifferently 
tfor the fireworks to start...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttWe must eat our food!  Do we want 
ttUncle to feed the little man?

tThe guard pulls the man next to Helmut out of his seat and 
tpractically throws him to the floor to make room for himself 
tto sit down next to Helmut which he does... he half turns 
this body towards Helmut and turns Helmut around in the same 
tfashion so they are almost facing one another.  The Guard 
ttakes the wooden spoon and fills it with the soup and proceeds 
tto feed Helmut... he stuffs the spoonful of soup into his 
tmouth... and Helmut takes and swallows... then the Guard 
ttakes another spoonful and makes believe he is blowing it 
t(like a mother blows the hot soup not to burn the baby's 
tmouth)... and forces the spoonful into Helmut's mouth.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(continuing to feed 
ttthim as he puts the 
tttspoon in his mouth)
ttAnd now one for Aunt Ada...

tAs the Guard uses the name Ada, Helmut bites down on the 
tspoon and won't let it go... but if looks could kill... he 
tstares at the Guard with hate...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(pulling the spoon)
ttLet go, Doork, let go... it's the 
ttsoup that makes us big and strong... 
ttnot the spoon... LET IT GO!

tHelmut still holds it clenched in his teeth, and the Guard 
tsmacks his face full force.  Helmut lets it go... and holds 
this face, embarrassed and humiliated as any many would be...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttNow let's try it again...

tHe fills the spoon and sticks it toward Helmut's mouth, but 
tHelmut clenches his teeth keeping his mouth shut.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttI said let's try it again...

tHe shoves the spoon into his lips, as the soup drips all 
tover the front of Helmut's shirt.  The Guard uses the spoon 
tto clean the front of his shirt and forces the liquid he 
ttook from the shirt front into Helmut's mouth... Some of the 
tmen at the table and surrounding tables feel for Helmut, 
tothers think it's funny... they laugh quietly.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttOh, I know why you're unhappy... 
ttsoup without bread is terrible...

tThe Guard takes the large loaf of brown bread and rips a 
thuge piece out of the center of the loaf and proceeds to 
tstuff Helmut's mouth with bread, until he looks like his 
tcheeks are eight times their normal size.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttIsn't that better?  Now take some 
ttsoup...

tHe pushes a spoonful of soup into his mouth which is so full, 
tnothing can get in... consequently the bread spills out, the 
tsoup spills out... and he is a mess... (We play this scene 
tfor plot value, but it will work comically as well.)

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI've had enough, thank you... No 
ttmore, please...

tThe Guard just stares at him...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttPlease!

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttI'm surprised at you, Doork, you've 
ttbeen here two years now, you should 
tthave learned we, of the Third Reich, 
ttnever acknowledge the weak, sniveling, 
ttbegging of you swine...  that's all 
ttyou're good for... begging... 
ttpleading... praying...  you're a 
ttdisgrace to the human race.  That's 
ttwhy we of the superior race must do 
ttaway with all of you...

tThe guard turns to the other men at the table, and goes into 
tone of his mentally unbalanced tirades...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttAnd we will!  We will!  Do away with 
ttall of you.  You're worthless pigs... 
ttwith no courage, no guts, why if 
ttanyone did to me what I just did to 
ttDoork I would kill him!
ttt(turning to Helmut)
ttWhy don't you kill me, Doork?  Go 
tton...  kill me... kill me... take 
ttthe knife from the table and kill 
ttme...

tHelmut looks at the knife on the table, picks it up, holds 
tit in stabbing style, thinks about it... and we know by his 
tlook, he would love to...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(with knife in hand)
ttI would kill you... but I am getting 
ttmy release any day now... and I won't 
ttdo anything that would spoil my 
ttchances...

tHelmut digs the knife into the table top and buries his head 
tin his hands... totally shook from the encounter...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttYour release?

tHe begins to laugh, but hysterically.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttRelease?  They told me you were 
ttfunny...  but I never realized just 
tthow funny you are...  RELEASE ????

tAnd the hysterical laughter really echoes throughout the 
tmess hall as the Guard makes his way towards the exit.  The 
tmen at the table slowly get up and exit the scene, as do the 
tothers at the surrounding tables... leaving Helmut just 
tsitting there... we PULL BACK to reveal the empty mess hall, 
tand the lonely sad body of Helmut, as he looks around 
trealizing he's alone, gets up and slowly creeps out of the 
thall like a puppy with his tail between his legs... as we

<b>tEXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY
</b>
tThere are two rows of prisoners quarters, wooden buildings, 
tweather beaten each row consists of about a dozen barracks 
teach... joined at the ends, farthest from the CAMERA by the 
tadministration building, a two story type making a "U" shape 
tof the compound... The entire yard is surrounded by two high 
twire fences about ten yards apart and fifteen feet high.   
tAt intervals of about twenty-five yards, in the area between 
tthe fences, are the guard towers, each about eighteen feet 
tabove the ground equipped with searchlights, sirens, machine 
tguns, with three Guards on duty.  Along outer fence, also 
tabout twenty-five yards apart, other powerful lighting 
tequipment mounted on high poles.

tIt is morning and although the sun shines brightly it doesn't 
tin any way alter the drabness of the compound... nor does it 
thelp change the look of the men...

tThere are about three hundred men milling about, some still 
tchewing what was their breakfast, some pulling brown bread 
tfrom their shirt fronts and exchanging bread for cigarettes 
tor just making deals, one with another... some sit along the 
tbarracks walls trying to get some sun... others walking in 
tcircles... some talking, laughing, even playing cards... 
tdoing whatever they can to kill time...

tPAN the entire camp.  At completion of the long PAN 
tintroducing the prison camp, we pick up the sixtyish JOHANN 
tKELTNER (formally ANDERLICH), a warm, sensitive looking 
tgreying man, thin but with a dignity and a serenity about 
thim... He walks briskly (and we know he'd love to walk slowly 
tand tiredly, but we can see he knows his attitude and conduct 
twill help those that can't help themselves...)

tHis face tells us he is good, kind and the reason men want 
tto live, he is special and he smiles at all those he passes, 
tgreets the men and is generally what man wishes he could be 
tunder the same circumstances...

tHe walks into the building, which we learn is the barracks...

<b>tINT. BARRACKS - DAY
</b>
tThe barracks are empty... Keltner enters the huge room and 
tlooks around and sees Helmut at the other end of the barracks 
tjust walking back and forth like a caged lion... angry, hurt, 
tsad, and generally out of sorts... he can't even hear Keltner 
tapproaching him... he finally stops at the back wall of the

</b>ttBefore breakfast this morning,  I 
ttspoke to one of the guards, a very

ttjust like mine.  And he said he would 
ttget me a form, a special form.  Just 
ttbeen printed up.  And I'm to fill it 
ttout.  Isn't that good?

tKeltner looking at him, like a child that believes in the 
tboogie man:

</b>ttHow many times since you've been 
tthere, have you filled out forms?  
ttTwenty?  Thirty times??

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(in fast)
ttBut this is different.  It's entirely

tHelmut takes out a set of papers from his back pocket to 
tshow Keltner.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttSee?  These are made up by the Gestapo 
ttitself... and the form will go 
ttdirectly to Berlin, to Gestapo 
ttheadquarters.  That's the important

</b>ttt(sympathetically)

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(in fast, excited; 
tttscanning the papers)
ttAnd I have to be very careful of 
tteverything I put down on the form.  
ttThe tiniest detail could make the 
ttdifference.  Don't you agree?

tHelmut looks up and notices Johann is looking up towards the 
tceiling of the barracks... watching something... Helmut looks 
tup, too.

<b>tTHEIR POV - THE BIRDS

tUp and under the eaves of the barrack just above their heads, 
ttwo small birds are perched (apparently they flew in from 
toutside and decided to nest there).

<b>tBACK TO HELMUT AND KELTNER - TWO SHOT
</b>
<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttIsn't it strange?  They are free to 
ttgo anywhere they want, and they come 
tthere to nest.

tHelmut doesn't react to Keltner's dialogue, but goes back to 
this creased and soiled papers that he's read a thousand times 
tbefore, and reads them again... as he reads... Keltner takes 
ta piece of brown bread from his shirt pocket and crumbles it 
tand throws the crumbs up to the little birds...

<b>tHIS POV - THE BIRDS
</b>
tThey scramble to chew the crumbs, and they do...

tHelmut goes back to studying his papers, Keltner ponders 
tHelmut's remark, looks backup at the birds... his face full 
tof compassion, as we:

<b>ttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. BARRACKS - NIGHT (DUSK)
</b>
tWe now see the Barracks completely (SHOOTING from flat on), 
tthe wooden bunks are housed in a low wooden building with 
teight two tier bunks on each side.  A group of men are 
tclustered around Keltner's bunk.  Here we meet:  ADOLF, a 
tlarge, once powerful man, in his mid thirties.  LUDWIG, once 
ta fairly prosperous businessman before his politics landed 
thim in prison, is older, and his bitterness is written all 
tover his face.  FRANZ, is the youngest.  He is a sensitive 
tlooing twenty five year old, more than likely the "rebel" 
ttype of the 1930s.

tHelmut is in his upper bunk over Keltner writing on an old 
tpiece of paper with a scruffy pencil, which he bites to make 
ta point of, and wets with his tongue like any fat butcher 
tselling liverwurst and marking the price on a brown paper 
tbag... (i.e. Brooklyn, circa 1928).

tWe TRUCK the CAMERA down the long barrack to include the 
tother men doing their things.  A couple of men are getting 
tready for a card game... several others are comparing 
tclothing, mending and helping one another, a couple play 
tchess.  A few are sleeping, but for the most part, most of 
tthe men lay in their bunks staring at the ceiling... The 
tfloors are spotless... suffice to say they better be... the 
twalls have nothing hanging but a few socks drying... a torn 
tcalendar, wrong year, etc.

<b>tCLOSE - KELTNER GROUP
</b>
tJohann sits with his back to CAMERA... at the edge of his 
tbunk, leaving room on his bunk for Adolph, Ludwig, Franz.

tHe is showing something to them that we cannot see.  Keltner's 
tbody covers whatever it is that the three men are gawking 
tat, facing CAMERA... and they are indeed gawking with delight 
tand admiration.

<b>tttt  LUDWIG
</b>ttt(seriously)
ttI think we should eat it!

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttNot on your life...
ttt(catching himself)
ttEr, that is... I wouldn't...

<b>tttt  FRANZ
</b>ttPut it somewhere so it can brighten 
ttup the place.

<b>tttt  LUDWIG
</b>ttt(sourly)
ttIt would take a hell of a lot more 
ttthan that to brighten up this place.

<b>tttt  ADOLF
</b>ttIt'll be better than looking at your 
ttlong face.

tChuckling, Keltner rises.  We BOOM UP with him, and as his 
thead comes up over the top of the bottom bunk... he holds 
tout the object for Helmut to see... It is a potato, a sorry 
tlooking spud... that Keltner has put in a small can of water 
tand is beginning to sprout two sick-looking shoots.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttt(to Helmut)
ttDo you see the way it's sprouting...  
ttI told you it wasn't completely 
ttrotten.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(his mind on his thing)
ttThat's nice, Johann.  Do you remember 
ttwhen I filled out those last forms?  
ttThe date might be important.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttt(almost annoyed)
ttAbout four weeks ago, I think.

<b>tLOOSER SHOT
</b>
tAs Keltner walks away from Helmut's bunk.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttI'll put it up here on the window 
ttsill, it'll get the morning sun.

tHe reaches the window and starts to reach up, to place the 
tpotato on the sill... a hand shoots out holding the hand of 
tKeltner...

<b>tttt  STOUT PRISONER
</b>ttThink you can trust your potato so 
ttclose to me, Reverend?

<b>tttt  LUDWIG
</b>ttThe potato he TRUSTS... it's you he 
ttdoesn't trust!

tAll the men laugh, including the "stout prisoner" who laughs 
tthe loudest... Keltner hands the stout prisoner the potato, 
twho in turn takes same and places it gently on the window 
tsill just adjacent to his bunk... after placing it on the 
tsill, he gestures ala the trapeze artist after making a super 
ttruck, looking for applause... Keltner pats his leg in a 
tgesture of "thank you".  He starts back towards his bunk 
twhen the front door of the barracks flings open and the Guard 
tenters.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b><b>ttATTENTION !
</b>
tThe men jump, but quickly, to their feet, and stand at 
tattention at the front of their bunks, ala inspection in the 
tarmy.  They are rigid and waiting to hear what's up.  The 
tGuard takes a few steps into the barracks... behind him we 
tsee several prisoners carrying bunks waiting to enter the 
tbarracks.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttAll the prisoners from the other 
ttside of the camp are being moved 
ttover to this side of the camp over 
ttto this side of the camp.  Barracks 
tt"H" will make room for three 
ttadditional bunks.

tHe takes a few steps down the aisle...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttI want all the bunks moved down toward 
ttthe far end.  Get them as close 
tttogether as possible. Now! GET MOVING!

<b>tLONG SHOT
</b>
tThe men scramble back to their own bunks and immediately 
tbegin pulling, shoving, and grumbling comments about being 
ttoo overcrowded as it is...

<b>tttt  THE MEN
</b>ttt(ad lib)
ttGotta have more room... We need more 
ttspace...  Hey, watch where you're 
ttgoing. This is stupid!

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttYOU!  You down there at the end...  
ttget those bunks right up against the 
ttwall.

<b>tCLOSE - HELMUT AND KELTNER
</b>
tAs bunks are moved towards the far end of the barracks, 
tKeltner and Helmut prepare to move their bunks, the last 
tones on their side.  Helmut and Adolf, who have already made 
ttheir move, come up to Keltner to help him with his bunk... 
tHelmut sees that Keltner has help so he decides to back off 
tand hide in his little corner with his pencil and scrap of 
tpaper... totally involved with his own pain and his undying 
tfantasy about his ultimate release...

<b>tWIDER SHOT - THE ENTIRE BARRACKS
</b>
tThe guard looks down the barracks as the men just about finish 
tthe moving job...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttHurry it up!  Come on, get moving!

tThe guard turns towards the door and motions for the SIX 
tPRISONERS to enter the barracks... they enter by pairs, each 
tpair carrying a double-tier bunk.

tTheir personal belongings are piled on the bunks and slung 
tover their shoulders in sacks (barracks bags)... the Guard 
tmotions for the two bunks to be placed next to Helmut's and 
tone on the opposite side... next to the Stout Prisoner... 
tNOTE:  This arrangement leaves space for one additional bunk 
tright by the door.

tThe guard motions for the Stout Prisoner and Herman to give 
tthe new arrivals a hand with the placement of their bunks.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttGet them close.
ttt(he looks around the 
tttbarracks)
ttYou're all going to be nice and cozy 
ttin here.

<b>tttt  STOUT PRISONER
</b>ttt(in a loud voice)
ttYeah, like triplets before they are 
ttborn to a mother weighing 98 pounds...

<b>tttt  HERMAN
</b>ttThat's what I call cozy!

tThe guard smiles, and all the men laugh...

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tThe guard starts for the door, satisfied with the 
tarrangements... as he gets the door open, Helmut runs over 
tto catch him before he makes his exit...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(anxiously)
ttExcuse me, sir, the papers...  Did 
ttthey arrive yet?

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(annoyed)
ttThey'll have to wait!

tHe exits, closing the door behind him.  Helmut, with a look 
tof despair on his face, goes back to his bunk.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT AND KELTNER
</b>
<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttYou'd think, since he was coming 
ttover here anyway, the least he could 
ttdo was bring the papers with him.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttThis moving men around has undoubtedly 
ttkept him very busy... don't worry, 
tthe'll bring them.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI'm sure if I asked him again he'd 
ttreally become annoyed with me.  Would 
ttyou remind him for me, please?

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttt(kindly)
ttOf course I will.

tHelmut climbs up to his bunk and goes back to his precious 
tpaper work.

<b>tWIDER ANGLE
</b>
tAs the new prisoners make up their bunks and arrange their 
tbelongings, the regulars of Barracks H, among them Adolf, 
tLudwig, Herman and Franz, begin moving towards them to meet 
tthem.  Keltner turns to the new white-haired prisoner whose 
tbunk is directly next to his.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttI've seen you around the yard, but 
ttthe others...

<b>tttt  WHITE-HAIRED MAN
</b>ttAbout thirty of them got here 
ttyesterday from the prison outside of 
ttFrankfurt.

<b>tttt  1ST NEW PRISONER
</b>ttt(who occupies the 
tttbunk above the white-
ttthaired prisoner)
ttFor the last three months we've been 
ttshuttled from one camp to another.

<b>tttt  2ND NEW PRISONER
</b>ttt(his bunk is the lower 
tttbunk on the direct 
tttopposite side)
ttNow they're shuffling us from one 
ttside to another.  I think they're 
tttrying to lose us.

<b>tttt  HERMAN
</b>ttDo you think they're bringing in war 
ttprisoners?

<b>tttt  LUDWIG
</b>ttI don't know why they're sending 
ttthem here...  we're overcrowded as 
ttit is.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttNo, no... it's got to be something 
ttelse...  Otherwise they would have 
ttleft the bunks.

<b>tttt  ADOLF
</b>ttIt could be possible that he is fixing 
ttup the barracks for some of his lady 
ttfriends.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttThat many women?

<b>tttt  HERMAN
</b>ttt(standing at attention)
ttReverend, we Germans are SUPERMEN!

tAll the men break out in laughter at Herman's comment and 
this actions... but the laughter is cut short as they HEAR 
tthe door open again, and they all look in that direction.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tSHOOTING OVER the men onto the door, entering is the same 
tguard that was just there... this time he enters with two 
tmore prisoners carrying their bunks.  One of them is JOSEF 
tGALT, a burly bully like man, who knows all the tricks of 
tsurvival, and ERNST UHLMANN, a think little man with a face 
tlike a weasel... they follow the Guard into the barracks 
tproper.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b><b>ttATTENTION !
</b>
tThe men quickly snap to attention.  The guard indicates for 
tGalt and Uhlmann to put the bunk in the space right by the 
tdoor.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttWe might as well be outside.

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttIf I get pneumonia, I'll hold the 
ttgovernment responsible!

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttWith a little luck, you'll both get 
ttpneumonia!

tThe guard turns and moves towards the door, stops, and turns 
tto see all is well, and exits the door, closing it behind 
thim.

tGalt sits on the lower bunk as Uhlmann sprints up to the 
tupper bunk and looks towards the original men, who are just 
tstanding around watching the two new "fish"... then men sense 
ttrouble and slowly and quietly return to their own bunks... 
tsome of the other men just stare at the two new prisoners...

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttt(sitting on his bunk)
ttIt's sure quiet in here...

<b>tWIDER ANGLE
</b>
tUhlmann in his surveying the barracks spots the potato plant 
ton the window sill... next to the Stout Prisoner's bunk... 
the jumps from his bunk and runs over towards the plant... he 
ttakes it from the window sill and yells over to Galt...

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttHey, Galt!  Come over and look at 
ttthis!

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttt(coming over to Uhlmann)
ttWhat is it?

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttAin't it cute?

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttIt's a God damn posie!

tHe and Uhlmann burst into laughter...

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttLooks kinda sick, doesn't it?

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttt(examining it)
ttIt's one of them potato things...  
ttand it sure as hell is sick!

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttMaybe we should put it out of its 
ttmisery.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttNo, we don't want to do that...  we 
ttmight break someone's heart.

tHe looks around at the other prisoners.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttWhose little plant is this?

tThe stout prisoner gets up from his bunk and starts to move 
tforward and challenge Galt... but Keltner jumps from his 
tbunk and gets to Galt first.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttt(with deep conviction)
ttThe plant is MINE!

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttIs it now?  Tell me precious... do 
ttyou knit, too?

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttIf necessary, I can... and I do !

tThis brings a ripple of laughter from the others... 
tparticularly the new prisoners who are delighted at seeing 
tsomeone stand up to Galt for a change... Galt with a sneer 
ton his face steps out into the aisle to face Keltner square 
ton!

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttt(to Uhlmann)
ttWhat do you think of that, Uhlmann... 
tthe knits!

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttNow, if he could just cook...

tGalt and Uhlmann laugh, but they are the only ones that do...

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttt(coming out of the 
tttlaugh)
ttCan you cook, sweetheart?

tKeltner knows damn well he can't fight the brute, yet he 
trealizes that if he steps down, life not only for him, but 
tfor the others in the barracks will be intolerable under 
tGalt's bully rule.  (During the following dialogue, Adolf, 
tFranz, Ludwig, Herman and the Stout Prisoner... easy up a 
tlittle closer to Keltner and Galt.)

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttIf necessary, I can cook, yes!  Now, 
ttif you don't mind, I'll take that 
ttplant!

tHe holds out his hand... Galt, wearing a deceptive smile, 
teyes the older man...

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttAlright, old man, you really want 
ttit?

tHe raises his arm over his head with the plant in that hand.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttGo get it!!

<b>tCLOSE - KELTNER
</b>
tHe looks past Galt at Helmut who is sitting up on his bunk...

<b>tCLOSER - KELTNER
</b>
tHe looks at Helmut.  His eyes try to encourage Helmut to do 
tsomething, say something, do anything to show that he is on 
tKeltner's side.

<b>tCLOSE - HELMUT
</b>
tHe sits up on his bunk, and wants nothing to do with the 
tbully and his pranks... so he goes back to studying his papers 
tand looks up again to catch Keltner's look of disappointment, 
tand as Keltner turns away from Helmut... Helmut realizes he 
tshould do something to show Keltner he, indeed, cares... he 
tjumps down from his bunk and grabs Galt by the arm and turns 
thim around... they are now face to face...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttWhy don't you pick on someone your 
ttown size...

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttt(shocked, but pleased 
tttthat he finally got 
ttta rise out of someone)
ttWhat?

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(firmly)
ttYou heard me!  Give him his plant 
ttback, and leave him alone...  He 
ttdidn't bother you ... and if you 
tthave to show your muscle, there's 
ttplenty of other guys to pick on!

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttYou're my size!

t... and with this, Galt smacks Helmut a shot across the mouth 
tthat sends him spilling into the corner, half knocked 
tunconcious... he lays there with blood flowing from his 
tmouth...

tKeltner leaves Galt and runs to the corner to see if Helmut 
tis okay.  Galt follows him... Keltner is leaning down checking 
tHelmut... as Galt bends down next to the two of them... still 
tholding the plant.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttHe's alright... that'll teach him to 
ttkeep his nose out of my business... 
tthere's your plant!

tGalt makes like he's handing the plant to Keltner, who reaches 
tfor it, and as he does Galt slowly stands up making Keltner 
treach and reach and reach... and as Keltner gets closer and 
tcloser, Galt stands to his fullest height... making it 
tliterally impossible for Keltner to get it... Franz, Ludwig, 
tAdolf, Herman and the Stout Prisoner (more than likely 
tprovoked by Helmut's stand, now circle Galt)...

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttt(still holding the 
tttplant up high)
ttGo on, little man, reach for it!

tKeltner, torn between seeing that Helmut is alright, and 
tgetting his plant back, tries to get it, and still looks to 
tsee that Helmut isn't hurt too bad...

<b>tttt  HERMAN
</b>ttt(in a low menacing 
tttvoice)
ttGive it to him!

tGalt looks at him with a menacing stare...

<b>tttt  ADOLF
</b>ttYou heard him... give it to him!

<b>tttt  FRANZ
</b>ttYou've had your fun... give it to 
tthim... NOW!

<b>tttt  STOUT PRISONER
</b>ttt(closing in on Galt)
<b>ttRIGHT NOW!!
</b>
tGalt realizes this is no time for a showdown... and with a 
tchildlike smile... grits his teeth...

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttSure, here's your stupid flower or 
ttwhatever you call it...

tKeltner takes it from him.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttThank you...

tKeltner leans down and picks Helmut up and walks him to his 
tbunk, helps him onto it, and puts the plant on his own bunk...

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tThe four men:  Ludwig, Adolf, Franz and Herman stay with 
tGalt, as does the Stout Prisoner... They are clustered around 
tGalt.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttWhat's the matter with you guys?  
ttCan't you take a joke?

<b>tttt  ADOLF
</b>ttWhat joke?

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttHell, all I was doing was trying to 
tthave a little fun.

<b>tttt  LUDWIG
</b>ttHave it with someone else!

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttWhat's so special about him?

<b>tttt  ADOLF
</b>ttThat's the Reverend.  Even when they 
ttcame and dragged him from his 
ttchurch...  he kept right on preaching 
ttagainst them until they knocked him 
ttunconscious.

tGalt is silent for a beat.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttWell, how the hell was I supposed to 
ttknow?

<b>tttt  HERMAN
</b>ttNOW you know!

tGalt shoves his way through the five men and walks beaten, 
tfor the moment, to his own bunk... as the men disperse and 
twalk back to their respective bunks...

<b>tCLOSE - GALT AND UHLMANN
</b>
tGalt walks over and sits at the edge of his bunk, while 
tUhlmann swings his legs back and forth from his perched 
tposition on the top of his bunk... Galt gives him a stare...

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttYou and your posies...

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttThat was close...

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttWhere were you when I need you?

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttI make love, not war!
ttt(goes giggly over 
tttwhat he just said)
ttHey, that's pretty good... I made 
ttthat up... Make love, not war!  I 
ttbet that would make a good slogan 
ttsomeday...

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttAw, shut up!

tAnd he smacks his legs up and onto the bunk.

<b>tTWO SHOT - KELTNER AND HELMUT
</b>
tKeltner with a wet towel in his hand cleaning the blood-
tdripping mouth of Helmut...

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttThat was really very nice of you, 
ttHelmut...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttYeah, nice and STUPID!

tHelmut grabs the towel and throws it to the floor and turns 
ton his side away from Keltner.  Keltner bends down, gets the 
ttowel, sits on the edge of his bunk... looks up, wonders and 
tponders Helmut as we

<b>ttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. BARRACKS H - NIGHT
</b>
tThe door to Barracks H slowly opens and Helmut peeks through 
tthe opening to see that all is clear... he slips out and 
twalks along the dark, dreary alleyway towards the Guard's 
tshack... he moves like a prisoner trying to miss the 
tspotlights in a jail break...

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tHelmut gets to the Guards hut... he looks into the window, 
tand sees the Guard he wants... sitting at his desk eating 
toff a tray that has a meal fit for a king on it... including 
tthe "doilies"... wine, and a steak that would satisfy six 
tmen in Barracks H... Helmut looks around to be sure no one 
tnotices him and slowly slips up to the front door of the 
tshack and knocks on the door...

<b>tINT. GUARD'S SHACK - NIGHT
</b>
<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(annoyed at being 
tttbothered)
ttCome in!

tThe meek and frightened Helmut enters the shack and walks 
tover to the Guard's desk, and his eyes go immediately to the 
ttray of food.  While the Guard just stares at him... somewhat 
tshocked at his presence in the shack.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(breaking the silence)
ttWhat the hell are you doing here?  
ttWho gave you permission to leave 
ttyour quarters?

tHelmut tries to talk as the guard gets louder and louder.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttAre you some kind of privileged 
ttcharacter?

tHelmut nods no...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttThen what are you doing out of the 
ttbarracks?

tThe frustration of not being able to answer, and the 
tfrustrations of being hungry... and the child-like treatment 
tHelmut is getting from this Pig becomes emotionally too 
tmuch... as he screams...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(turning red)
ttIf you'll shut your stupid mouth 
ttmaybe I can answer one of your 
ttquestions!

tThe Guard looks at Helmut in disbelief... but at the same 
ttime a little delighted at this chance to show his German 
tsuperiority... as he slowly gets up from behind the desk and 
tcrosses to Helmut, with a sneer that would frighten Rommel...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(nose to nose with 
tttHelmut)
ttI have a STUPID MOUTH?

tHelmut backs away towards the door, and the Guard moves closer 
tand closer to him... backing him up against the door.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(meekly)
ttI'm sorry, I didn't mean to raise my 
ttvoice...

tHe bows his head in fear, as well as concern for what he 
tmight have done to his chances of release.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttThe volume of your voice isn't the 
ttissue...  it's what comes out of 
ttyour mouth that disturbs me...  maybe 
ttyou need a little lesson in respect 
ttand courtesy...

tAnd he smacks Helmut across the face with his black glove...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>tt... and maybe I've been a little too 
ttsoft with you...

tHe smacks him again, harder... the glove now feels like a 
tsword to Helmut... and his hands hang limp down by his sides.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttYou see, Doork, I knew why you came 
ttin here...  I knew why you left your 
ttbarracks without permission... It's 
ttjust that I hadn't heard you mention 
ttyour release papers for so long I 
tthad hoped I could hear you begging 
ttonce more...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(in a whisper)
ttI'm sorry...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(mimicking him)
ttI'm sorry, I'm sorry... You're a 
ttsorry specimen of a human being... 
ttthat's what you are...

tAnd he smacks him this time with all the force he can 
tmuster...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttNow, I will help you to your quarters, 
ttHerr Doork, here you will stay, and 
ttpray for release papers that may, or 
ttmay not, ever come...

tThis wakes Helmut's soul and he becomes erect and stonefaced 
tat the words the guards just said... this look infuriates 
tthe guard even more... he grabs Helmut by the scruff of the 
tneck... like grabbing a wet cat to be thrown out of the 
thouse... and he opens the door and pulls Helmut by the back 
tof the office... out the door, down the three steps and onto 
tthe ground... and pulls him like a sack of potatoes to the 
tbarracks doorway...

<b>tEXT. BARRACKS H - DOORWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tHelmut is just about beaten at this point as the guard opens 
tthe door of the barracks and pulls Helmut into the doorway, 
tand his body stops on the threshold.

</b>
tSHOOTING OVER the men onto the doorway... in the deep b.g. 
tthe sad body and figure of the man lays in the doorway, as 
tthe Guard kicks him in the ribs, unmercifully...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttNow, get inside where you belong and 
ttdon't ever let me catch you doing 
ttanything without permission again.

tHelmut slowly gets up... in pain and practically crawls to 
this bunk... having to pass all the men, almost as though he 
twere ashamed .. he gets to his bunk, and tries vainly to get 
tup to the top where he lives... Keltner helps him... and as 
the settles in his place...

</b>
tKeltner leaning over the side of Helmut's bunk whispering... 
tas the other men go back to their respective chores and 
twhatever they were doing when the guard stormed in...

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttHelmut, Helmut, how could you think 
ttof doing such a thing? I begged you 
ttnot to irritate him...  and that I

</b>ttt(gritting his teeth)
ttLeave me alone!  ... and mind your

tKeltner knows this is nothing more than Helmut's dismay and 
tpain in his heart talking... The kindly man drops down to 
this own bunk... just shaking his head... as if to say, how 
tcan I help him?  as we:

</b>
tThe same Guard is motioning for the men to hurry and get 
toutside... he is standing at the doorway to the barracks and 
tthe men are moving out into the ice cold morning as briskly 
tas they can... the Guard moves inside after the last man has 
tmade his exit...

<b>tINT. BARRACKS - DAY
</b>
tSHOOTING OVER the Guard as he looks around, we see Keltner 
tcoming out of the toilet area, rushing because he's late... 
the throws his towel on his bunk, and as he does... he sees 
twhat stops him in his tracks...

<b>tKELTNER'S POV
</b>
tIt is Helmut still sound asleep in his bunk...

</b>
tKeltner moves towards Helmut to wake him...

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(in a sotto voice)
ttReverend, let him sleep... you move 
ttout, I'll take care of this...

tKeltner reluctantly starts to move out towards the front 
tdoor, as the Guard passes him on his way to Helmut's bunk... 
tKeltner goes out the door... the Guard sneaks over towards 
tthe bunk where Helmut is asleep and very sneakily slips the 
tcover off Helmut's body... then proceeds to open the window 
tabove his head and the window alongside... and across the 
tway and opens the back door... which is adjacent to the toilet 
tarea... and walks out of the barracks leaving the front door 
twide open...

<b>tEXT. BARRACKS H - DAY
</b>
tAll the men are lined up for inspection, they are all looking 
tstraight ahead as the Guard walks down the line.

tAll except Keltner who can't help but look in the direction 
tof the barracks where he knows Helmut is still sleeping.  He 
tthrows a glance at the guard as if to say... why?  Why are 
tyou doing this?  Why did he leave Helmut sleeping, usually 
tthe one thing that would send the guard up a wall... why is 
the allowing this to happen?

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttt(as he finishes his 
tttwalk)
ttYou are a sick looking group of 
ttthings...  I can't even call you 
tthuman...  because you're not... you're

tThe men break up and go about their business, they move in 
tall directions, but Keltner starts for the doorway to the 
tbarracks and is detoured by the guard who knew he would, as 
the stands in the way of Keltner who has to turn away and go 
tabout his business... the Guard peeks into the barracks.

<b>tINT. BARRACKS - GUARD'S POV - DAY
</b>
tHelmut still sleeping...

<b>tEXT. BARRACKS - CLOSE - GUARD - DAY
</b>
tHe is delighted... he grabs the door and slams it shut with 
ta bang that would wake the dead... then opens it again and 
twalks off...

<b>tINT. BARRACKS - CLOSE - HELMUT - DAY
</b>
tHe jumps from out of his hard sleep... foggy and unsure about 
twhere he is, what time it is and he looks around and sees 
tthe barracks are empty... and he panics... but he is also 
tshivering... the barracks feel like the inside of a meat 
ttruck refrigerated somewhat below zero...

tHelmut grabs his pants from the front of his bunk, pulls the 
tcover over him and tries to get the pants on under the 
tcover... It is cold!  (Photographically, we can show "cold"... 
tProps:  vapor/smoke.)

tHe gets his pants on and jumps down onto the cold floor and 
tdances from the ice-like floor, he bends down looking for 
this socks and shoes... he wears just a tee-shirt...

tHaving trouble finding both shoes, he grabs the blanket again 
tand covers himself with it, while searching for the other 
tshoe...

tHe finds the other shoe and proceeds to put them on... takes 
ta beat and sees he has no socks on... reaches under the bank 
tand pulls out the pair of socks... which stand straight up 
t(from the cold ... he holds them in the air, and drops one 
tat a time and they sound like "pans" hitting the floor... he 
ttakes one and blows warm air from his mouth into the socks, 
tone at a time, which warms them... (Props:  the socks need 
tdiscussion!)

tHe then proceeds to put his shoes on and puts one on, and 
tthen the other... now wearing both shoes he starts to tie 
tthe laces... he pulls them straight away to tie and they 
tstand straight up!  (Props:  this is done with leather laces, 
tpure leather... it works without any unnecessary rigging!)

<b>tINSERT - THE STANDING STRAIGHT LACES
</b>
<b>tBACK TO SCENE
</b>
tHe finally gets them tied and starts, still sleepily, into 
tthe toilet area... (We can go for a great sound joke here.)  
tHe steps into the latrine, closes the door and we HEAR the 
tSOUND of crushed ice being poured into the bowl... he flushes 
tand we HEAR what might sound like an ice crusher... he steps 
tout of the latrine and walks over to the basin and turns the 
twater on.

<b>tINSERT
</b>
tThe water spigots... they both read "COLD".

<b>tBACK TO SCENE
</b>
tAnd as he takes some water on his hands to his face... it is 
t"cold" and his face just freezes from the pain of the cold... 
the looks around and sees the little metal ashtray, that looks 
tlike a small bowl or a tin from a used shaving cream lather 
tsoap... he fills it with water.. and to show his ingenuity, 
the takes a lighter from his pocket, places the tin on the 
tedge of the sink and lights the fire under the tin (which 
tcouldn't possibly hold more than a handful of water) and 
tproceeds to heat same...

tOnce he is satisfied that it is at least warmer than the 
tspigot supplied, he grabs for the tin which is so hot from 
tthe burning, he screams in another type pain... the pain of 
t"HOT" hurting... he decides to flick his fingers in the tin 
tbowl and splash some of the water on his face (which is by 
tnow, just drips of water)... brushes his teeth with his finger 
tand soap... straightens his hair and exits the toilet to his 
tbunk to get his shirt... another "ICE COLD" item... he feels 
thow cold it is, and doesn't have the courage for another 
tclimate blast... he rolls up his shirt and places it under 
this armpit to warm it... as it hits under his arm... the 
tcold just about wipes him out... he decides to sit on it... 
tand he does.

<b>tCLOSE - THE GUARD - AT THE DOOR
</b>
tHe's been peeking all the while... He figures he's had his 
tlaugh, and it's the first time we see he can laugh... he 
tsteps into the barracks area, and yells:

</b>ttDoork!  Move it out, and on the

tHelmut jumps with fright, unravels his shirt, runs towards

tMost of the men are clustered around their bunks, and in the 
tdull light we see some of them in the aisles, talking, playing 
tcards... while most of the others are whistling, clapping, 
tand laughing as Uhlmann does his silly little clog dance... 
tit is apparent the ugly episode between Galt and Uhlmann has 
tbeen forgotten for the moment.

tThe lights are hung from cords down off the ceiling and for 
ta complex this size it could use ten... there are but two.

tUhlmann is having the time of his ignorant life... the more 
tthe men applaud, the more he "clog dances".

ttIt looks like Helmut found some new

</b>
tThe four new men are surrounding Helmut on the top of his 
tbunk listening to his bragging.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttSo I told Mr. Ringling if he wanted 
tt"Helmut" he'd have to bring his circus 
ttto Germany... I am a German, I told 
tthim, and my responsibility is to my

<b>tttt  1ST PRISONER (NEW ONE)
</b>ttDid you really say that?

</b>ttt(proudly)
ttOf course I did... they offered me 
ttanything...  anything I wanted to go 
ttwith them.

<b>tttt  2ND NEW PRISONER
</b>ttHey! I saw the circus in Berlin about 
ttfour years ago...  Didn't  you make

ttwith a pair of tails on the jacket 
ttabout fifty feet long?  Sure!  And a 
ttfunny Little clown at the very end 
ttcarrying the tails like a woman's 
tttrain?

tHelmut studies the prisoners glare and decides he couldn't 
teven remember the clown he saw was Gustav the Great, why 
tnot?  No one would ever know... and he nods with a kind of 
tstudied humility... yes.

<b>tttt  2ND NEW PRISONER
</b>ttYou were great!

tHelmut eats it up.

<b>tttt  2ND NEW PRISONER
</b>ttYou should have seen him... You'd 
ttnever know it was him... with the

</b>ttHow do "clowns" ever come up with

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttIt doesn't happen overnight... it

ttone that's just right for you.

<b>tttt  4TH NEW PRISONER
</b>ttMy kids will never believe this, I 
ttcan't wait to... tell...

tHis voice trails off as he realizes the hopelessness of what 
the was about to say.  This puts a damper on the discussion 
tand the men start to break up and get down off the bunk.  
tHelmut, seeing his captive audience leaving... panics.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(emotionally)
ttWait, let me tell you some other

ttPlease... let me just have a few 
ttmore...

<b>tttt  1ST NEW PRISONER
</b>ttt(ignoring Helmut 
tttcompletely)
ttWhat's going on with those guys?

tHe's looking off down the aisle where Uhlmann has his 
taudience... The four prisoners move out into the aisle to 
tget a better look, leaving Helmut perched on his bunk with a 
tpleading and broken look of despair...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(a last attempt)
ttDid you know "clowns" literally 
ttbequeath their faces to their sons, 
ttor sometimes to...

tHe realizes it's futile as the four new prisoners move towards 
tUhlmann and the others down the aisle...

<b>tttt  3RD PRISONER
</b>ttCome on, let's see what's such fun...

tHe moves and the others move along with him.  Helmut thinks 
tabout joining them, and starts to move off his bunk but his 
tbody won't respond... he just hangs there limply... his head 
tlowered, a sad man.

tas we see the four new prisoners walk over to watch the

<b>tMED. CLOSE - UHLMANN, GALT, KELTNER, AND OTHERS
</b>
tUhlmann is just finishing his dance with a spin, when he 
tfinally gets dizzy and topples over on one of the bunks.  
tAll the men applaud wildly.  Uhlmann laying half down and 
thalf up on the lower bunk he landed on, breathing heavily... 
tyells over to Galt...

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttHey, Galt, it's your turn, how about 
ttdoin' one of your belly dances for 
ttus?

tAll the men agree and start yelling for Galt to do it... 
tGalt moves out into the center of the aisle in the clearing 
tmade by the men, and holds up his hands for silence... they 
tquiet down and Galt looks around until he spots Keltner.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttReverend?

tThe men become very still, they look from Galt to Keltner 
tand back to Galt, their eyes reflecting suspicion of him, 
twondering what he's up to now.  Galt is fully aware of this.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttWell, Reverend, what do you think?  
ttWould a little belly-dancing be too 
ttmuch for the boys?

tKeltner studies Galt for a beat, then accepts his offer of a 
ttruce.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttt(moving over towards 
tttGalt)
ttA little fun is what we need... so...  
ttif you'll all hold the noise down, 
ttI'll join in.

tA hushed cheer goes up from the men as Keltner stands besides 
tGalt.  Galt holds his hands over his head and nods for Keltner 
tto do the same thing.  The Reverend does, and now Galt begins 
tundulating his hips.  Keltner studies the move for a beat 
tand then does the same thing but with comical awkwardness.  
tFranz starts playing a slow sensuous rhythm on his harmonica.  
tThe men clap and whistle softly.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tHe is sitting upright on top of his bunk, watching what Galt 
thas Keltner doing, a look of disgust passes his face as he 
tturns away from what he'd been watching and gets busy with 
this papers and figuring again.

<b>tMED. SHOT - GALT, KELTNER
</b>
tThey are just finishing their dance.  The men applaud wildly 
tbut softly... Keltner, puffing, moves over to the side and 
tsits on one of the bunks to catch his breath.  Galt takes a 
tfew bows, and the men react with applause and whistling that's 
tbeginning to take on "noise" proportions... Keltner motions 
tfor the men to hold it down... and they do.

<b>tttt  4TH NEW PRISONER
</b>ttSay, why don't we get the clown to 
ttdo something?

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttA clown?  Who's a clown??

</b>ttYou've heard of "Helmut Doork".  
ttThat's him down there!

<b>tWIDER SHOT
</b>
tas he starts walking towards Helmut's bunk...

<b>tttt  1ST NEW PRISONER
</b>ttOh, I'm sure he will!

tThe others follow right behind.  There is a look on Keltner's 
tface like he would like to stop them, but between his puffing 
tand his certainty that Helmut will be alright, he stays where 
the is.

</b>
tas he walks with the others.

</b>ttYou're wasting your time.  He doesn't

</b>ttHe's right, we've been asking him 
ttfor three years...  I have a feeling 
tthe only does his little routines for 
ttthe crowned heads of Europe.

</b>ttAnd, of course, the BIG heads of

tThere is general laughter... as the group arrives at Helmut's 
tbunk.

</b>
tHe sees something's going to happen, he puts his papers away 
tand sits upright... waiting... his eyes catch Galt's eyes 
tpeering at him.

tGalt tells it all with his eyes... This one isn't "sacred" 
tto the men... he might just be the pigeon Galt's been hoping 
tfor... the one every bully looks for, for his own brand of 
tfun.

ttNow, me and these... gentlemen...  
ttwe don't expect you to do your "act",

ttAw, forget it... and that's probably

tHelmut looks at him puzzled... he can't think or remember

ttI don't remember you using anything

ttHey... are you trying to fool us?

tWith this Keltner moves in and up to Galt.

</b>ttStay out of this, Reverend. We're

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttt(to the men)
ttRight!  If a Reverend can give us a 
ttlaugh, why not a clown?

tAll the men ad lib their agreement with what Uhlmann just 
tsaid; it appears that they are all on Galt's side, and Keltner 
tknows it.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttt(to Helmut, softly)
ttIt doesn't have to be anything

</b>ttCan't you get it through your heads,

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttt(firmly)
ttWE need you to give us a laugh.

tGalt grabs Helmut's jacket and pulls him off the bunk, nose 
tto nose to him...

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttSo... TRY!

tGalt has Helmut by the neck portion of the jacket, practically 
tchoking him to death... his vice-like hands are closing in 
ton his throat and Helmut's trying vainly just to breathe...

tOne of the prisoners starts pounding his feet and making a 
tmarch-like noise yelling from the other end... "So try!"... 
t"So try!"... "So try!"... "So try!"... the other prisoners 
tin the barracks pick up the chant and the stomping... Keltner 
tdoesn't even hear the racket they've started because of his 
tconcern for Helmut being choked to death... He tries to loosen 
tGalt's hands from Helmut's throat.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttThat's enough, leave him alone!

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttStay out of it, Reverend!

tGalt spins Helmut around so that his back is facing the aisle 
tand he walks him into the center area... the other men feeling 
tthis violence happening, and watching.  Helmut being choked, 
ttriggers all of their venom and their hate and they really 
tcome on strong... stomping, yelling...

<b>tttt  THE MEN
</b>ttt(ad lib)
ttChoke him harder...  see if that's

ttto me!  Hey, Galt, pull his string 
ttand make the dummy funny!

tAnd they stomp and they stomp and they stomp... "So try!"... 
t"So try!"... They get louder and louder... Helmut is kicking 
this legs, which are off the ground, and Galt won't let go.

<b>tCLOSE - HELMUT
</b>
tHis face is turning color... he hasn't a lot of air left in 
this lungs... and Keltner is practically hanging onto Galt 
ttrying to get his hands loose... and Galt could carry another 
tthree men without batting an eye.  Galt puts him down slowly, 
tin the middle of the aisle, so that just his feet touch the 
tground, but he keeps his hands around his throat.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttYour public is calling, clown...

<b>tWIDER SHOT
</b>
tSHOOTING OVER Galt, Keltner and Helmut, we see the door of 
tthe barracks slam open and bang against the wall making more 
tnoise than anything all the men made together, and they all 
tfreeze...

<b>tMED. CLOSE - THE GUARD
</b>
tHe stands in the doorway, legs spread apart, hands on his 
twaist... and he is wearing a raincoat, the barracks has become 
ttotally silent... all that is heard is the rain pecking away 
ton the roof.  Galt has let go of Helmut who just lays on the 
tfloor with Galt and Keltner on both sides of him...

ttOn your feet!

tHelmut gets up, dizzily, just about getting oxygen back into

ttHe was showing us some of his funny

tThe Guard surveys the faces of the others as they stare back.

ttBack to your bunks, all of you...  
ttTurn out the lights, and keep it 
<b>ttQUIET !
</b>
tAs the guard turns to the door to go, Helmut takes a step 
tforward about to stop the guard, Keltner grabs his arm and 
tturns him the other way... the Guard exits closing the door, 
tquietly behind him... The men start to disperse... Galt gives 
tHelmut a "I'll get you for this" look and returns to his own 
tbunk with Uhlmann almost up his ass following... Keltner 
tleads Helmut back to their bunk.

<b>tttt  HELMUT

ttI was just going to ask him about

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttt(shaking his head)
ttThat was not the time, believe me!

tKeltner sits Helmut down next to him on his lower bunk, as 
tHelmut rubs his throat, and tries swallowing a few times...

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttHurt much?

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(beaten)
ttNo, I'm alright... thank you.

tThey both sit in silence... Helmut breaks the silence...

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttJohann, why do they pick on me?  
ttI've never done anything to them.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttYou've never done anything for them!

tHelmut dislikes Keltner's remark and gets up from the lower 
tbunk and starts up to his.  He gets to the top bunk and starts 
tto get onto it, stops and whispers to Keltner.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttYou think I should have performed?

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttThe men would have appreciated it.

tHelmut rolls into his bunk, the lights go out and he lies on 
this back staring at the ceiling.  Keltner sits on the side 
tof his bunk and takes his shoes off... periodically the rays 
tfrom the searchlights revolving outside cross the windows to 
tmomentarily flood the barracks with light.  After a few 
tseconds, Helmut leans over to whisper to Keltner.

tHe stalks off.  Helmut starts to say something more but thinks 
tbetter of it.  Crushed, he starts back towards his barracks,

tand stops, his expression changing to one of uneasiness.

tthe looks on many faces bode no good for Helmut.

tThe men converge and form a half circle around him.

tAs the men close in on him, he moves back until we cna see 
tthe barbed wire fence behind him.  Helmut senses their 
tdisposition and remains warily silent.  Keltner and Franz 
tstand slightly behind the pack.

tand begin scurrying back to their own barracks.

ttall we're asking for.  Come on, 
ttHelmut, do something.

tHelmut, hoping to stall the inevitable, still hoping to 
tpreserve for a while longer his beautiful myth of being a

<b>tttt  LUDWIG

tAs the mention of the word "guard" the mood of the men turns

</b>ttt(his face pressed 
tttclose to Helmut's)
ttYou make us scream... scream with

tGalt presses Helmut right up to the barbed wire fence so he 
tcan feel the barbs in his back.

<b>tFULL SHOT - HELMUT, MEN
</b>
tGalt takes his hand away from Helmut's mouth.  Helmut doesn't 
tutter a sound.  He knows that Galt and the men mean business 
tand he now must do something.  He nods his head.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttAll right... all right.

tThe men move back to give him room.  Frantically, he tries 
tto think of something to do... he knows it must be great... 
tor else his myth will explode.  He walks around in a little 
tcircle, trying, trying to think of something.  Finally he 
tfaces them.  He bows his legs and pretends he's a bow-legged 
tman trying to walk a high wire, but he's so frightened the 
tresult is pathetic, not funny.

<b>tPAN SHOT - PRISONERS
</b>
tThe camera works across their faces, which are expressionless.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tSeeing that he is getting no reaction from his "audience", 
tHelmut tries something else.

tHe pulls his shirt over his head and walks around like a 
theadless man.  He pretends to trip over some unseen object, 
tpeers through the front of his shirt at it, and stamps on 
tthe object.  Again he tries to walk over it, and again he 
tslips.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, MEN
</b>
tas Helmut starts to repeat the same routine, many of the men 
tare openly contemptuous.  Galt wears a smirk.  Keltner, unable 
tto watch Helmut's degradation, moves away.  Others express 
ttheir disappointment, their disdain.

<b>tttt  MEN
</b>ttIf he's Germany's greatest clown,

tThey move away from him.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttGive me a chance.  I just got started.

tBut the men continue to walk away.  Helmut tries to do a

tignominously on all fours.  When he looks up, only Adolf, 
tGalt and Uhlmann remain.

ttYou stink.  You really stink.

tSeeing the disbelief on their faces, Helmut becomes almost 
thysterical.  He is still on his knees.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI am a clown.   I am.  I am.

tHe pounds on the ground in frustration.  Galt spits 
tcontemptuously, and the three start to leave.  Galt turns 
tback, looks down at Helmut.  Very deliberately, he comes 
tforward to stand at a mud puddle.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttDoork the Great.

tWith that he kicks a shower of mud directly into Helmut's 
tface.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tThe mud splatters over his face.  He cries out.  His hands 
tgo to his eyes instinctively.  he kneels there, rocking back 
tand forth in misery.  Then from o.s., we HEAR a tiny, 
ttentative laugh -- the tiniest laugh ever heard.  Helmut 
tlooks up quickly.  He isn't sure that he heard it.

tThen it comes again, a little stronger.  He looks around 
tquickly to see who has come back to taunt him, to ridicule 
thim.

tThe yard is empty except for a few prisoners from other

tHe is puzzled.  Then again he hears the laugh o.s.  He turns 
tslowly to look behind him.

<b>tMED. SHOT - BOY - HELMUT'S POV
</b>
tOn the other side of the fence stands a wide-eyed boy of 
tabout eight, who is watching Helmut timidly.  The ragged 
tyoungster laughs again, hesitantly, as if unsure what Helmut 
tis doing is supposed to be funny, but finding it so 
tnevertheless.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tHe looks uncertainly at the youngster.  Is the child 
tridiculing him, too?  He leans over the mud puddle and looks 
tat his reflection.  He likes what he sees.  The mud on his 
tface looks almost like a primitive clown mask.  Very 
tdeliberately Helmut scoops up more mud and puts a blob of it 
ton the end of his nose.  He waits for the child's reaction.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - BOY
</b>
tHis eyes are laughing, but his little lips are pressed tight 
ttogether.  He has been taught not to make sounds... not even 
tsounds of laughter.  But finally what he is looking at becomes 
ttoo much for him and the laughter spills out between his 
tlips as they form a smile.  He laughs delightedly now, 
tsatisfied that Helmut is being purposely amusing.

<b>tTWO SHOT - HELMUT, BOY
</b>
tHelmut gets to his feet, bows slightly and stiffly to the 
tchild, and then attempts another hand stand.  This time he 
tholds himself up for a moment and then deliberately allows 
thimself to fall on his back in the mud.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tAs he lands, he quickly glances off towards his barracks, 
tbut from the look of disappointment on his face, we know 
tthat none of his barracks mates are watching.  When he hears 
tmore laughter from o.s., he quickly rolls on his side to 
tlook.

<b>tMED. SHOT - CHILDREN - HELMUT'S POV

tTwo more youngsters have joined the first, and all are 
tlaughing excitedly.  The first child jumps up and down, 
tclapping his hands.

<b>tWIDER ANGLE - FROM THE FENCE - FAVORING HELMUT

tthe children's vindication for his claim that he is a clown.  
tHe turns toward the direction of his barracks.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(screaming at top of

ttCome back, damn you, come back.  The 
ttchildren... they're laughing.  They're 
ttlaughing.  I am a clown.  I am a

tHe turns back to the children and again bows.  He quickly 
tleans down, looks at his reflection in the puddle, and scoops 
tup a handful of mud which he plasters on his nose to make a 
tbulbous, artificial proboscis.  He turns back to the children 
tand in pantomime, pretends to see a fly buzzing about and 
ttries to swat it.  The imaginary fly buzzes closer.  The 
tCAMERA MOVES UP to --

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tAs the "fly" lands on his nose.  He looks cross-eyed at the 
tmud blob, then swats at it.  The blob falls off.

<b>tMED. SHOT - CHILDREN
</b>
tThere are now nine or ten youngsters at the fence, all 
tsquealing with delight.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tHe bows again, and as his head comes up he looks o.s. toward 
this barracks, still hoping that someone will be watching his 
t"great" success.  When he turns back to the children, we see 
tthat he continues to smile -- while tears course down his 
tcheeks through the mud still caked on them.

<b>ttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:

</b>
tThe last barracks on the open end of the camp on the political 
tprisoners' side.  Outside the building is a low counter 
tarrangement with two prisoners behind it serving mush and 
tblack bread to a long line of men, all of whom carry bowls 
tand spoons.

tThis time in mid-July, three weeks after the incident at the 
tfence.  The day is bright and hot.  Our ANGLE FAVORS Helmut 
tas he nears the prisoner who is serving up the mush.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tAs he moves up to be served and holds out his bowl.  The 
tprisoner - messman spoons a blob of mush into it.  Then he 
tlooks around quickly and, before Helmut can pull back his 
tbowl, slops another half spoonful into it with a wink at 
tHelmut, who gives him a grateful smile in return.  Helmut 
tmoves on to the bread server, who gives him a big grin as he 
tslips two pieces of bread into the bowl on top of the mush.  
tHelmut hurries away, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him.

tHe walks strangely, as if having trouble controlling his own 
tfeet.  Helmut ducks around the corner of the barracks nearest 
tthe mess hall, then peers cautiously back into the main yard.  
tSatisfied that he hasn't been noticed, he quickly puts one 
tpiece of bread into his pocket and takes out his spoon.  
tHolding the second piece of bread beneath the bowl, he wolfs 
tdown a few mouthfuls of the mush.  Then he smooths out the 
tremainder with the spoon to make the mush appear untouched. 
t He places the one slice of bread back on top of it, and 
tstudies the end result.  Nodding approval, he licks his spoon 
tclean and puts it back in his pocket.  He goes back around 
tthe corner of the barracks into the main yard and heads for 
tthe next building.

ttHere comes your second helping.

tAs Helmut's feet walk into FRAME and stop next to the Big

tas Helmut joins them and holds out his bowl of bread and 
tmush to the Big Prisoner.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttHere.

tStill grinning, the Big Prisoner puts his empty bowl on the 
tground beside him and takes Helmut's bowl.  Holding the bread 
taside, he digs into the mush.  Helmut watches him eat, his 
town hunger written all over his face.  After a few bites, 
tthis makes the Big Prisoner a little self-concious.

<b>tttt  BIG PRISONER
</b>ttHow're the shoes?

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttPerfect.

tThe Big Prisoner nods and goes back to eating, satisfied 
tthat he has made a fair bargain and shouldn't be embarrassed 
tabout taking Helmut's food.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttDon't forget the bowl.

tThe Big Prisoner, his mouth full of mush, only nods.  Helmut, 
ttearing his eyes from the food, moves off.  The Big Prisoner 
twatches him go.  Suddenly, he looks down at the departing 
tHelmut's feet, and his face darkens.

<b>tttt  BIG PRISONER
</b>ttt(irked)
ttHey, Doork!

tHelmut stops and turns as the Big Prisoner shoves himself 
taway from the hut and goes to him, staring down at the shoes.

<b>tttt  BIG PRISONER
</b>ttMy shoes!

tThe Big Prisoner reaches out with the large toe of one bare 
tfoot and lifts up the flapping toe of one of Helmut's shoes.  
tHe lets it drop again.

<b>tttt  BIG PRISONER
</b>ttI said you could use 'em, not ruin 
tt'em.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI had to fix them this way...  for 
ttthe act, you know.  Wait till you

</b>ttYeah.  But will I feel like laughing

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttWhen I return them, they'll be like

tThe Old Prisoner has finished his mush and puts his bowl 
tdown on the ground and moves forward to join Helmut and the

<b>tttt  BIG PRISONER
</b>ttFor what you've done to my shoes I

</b>ttHe's got to have something to eat.

tThe Big Prisoner looks at him questioningly.

</b>ttt(continuing)
ttIf he gives you his other meal...  
tthe'll starve to death.  Then you

</b>ttDoork!

<b>tMED. SHOT - BIG PRISONER - HELMUT'S POV
</b>
tThe Big Prisoner looks at Helmut, then at the piece of bread 
tHelmut had given him.  His manner is self-conscious.  He 
ttosses the piece of bread to Helmut.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, BIG PRISONER, OLD PRISONER
</b>
tHelmut catches the bread, his smile expressing his thanks.  
tThe Old Prisoner puts his arm around the Big Prisoner's 
tshoulder, while the Big Prisoner tries not to show that he 
tis pleased with himself for his "generous" act.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tTaking bites of the bread, Helmut, rather jauntily, lopes 
toff toward his own barracks.  As he moves among the other 
tprisoners, the CAMERA MOVING with him, we see many of them 
tpoint or nod toward Helmut and smile good-naturedly.  Helmut 
tis completely unaware of them, so lost is he in his own 
tthoughts.

<b>tEXT. BARRACKS H - MED. SHOT - KELTNER, FRANZ, HERMAN - DAY

tThey sit in the shade beside their barracks.  Herman is using 
this empty bowl as a fan.  Keltner is just finishing his food.  
tFranz is examining his jacket, his empty bowl beside him on 
tthe ground.

<b>tttt  FRANZ (IRRITATED)
</b>ttI mean it this time.

</b>ttDon't tell us.  Tell him.

tFranz holds up the tattered jacket to show that a button is

</b>ttWhat am I supposed to do? Use pins?

<b>tttt  HERMAN
</b>ttWho has a pin?

tKeltner chuckles.

<b>tttt  FRANZ
</b>ttYou can laugh.  He isn't always after

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttNo?

tHe fishes in a pocket and pulls out a large piece of chalk,

</b>ttChalk.

</b>ttFrom a guard.

tAstonished, Herman and Franz look at him questioningly.

</b>ttt(lowers his voice)
ttA very bad Nazi.  Still has a heart.

tHerman and Franz smile.  Then Franz holds up his tattered

tgiven to him by the Big Prisoner.  Keltner holds out the

tHelmut takes it and examines it in a very professional manner.

ttLook at it!  Yesterday a button off.

</b>ttGive in, Franz.  You know he's going 
ttto talk you out of it again.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI'll be careful.  I swear. Besides,

ttRight, kid?

</b>ttThat's got nothing to do with it.

ttI say he's one of them.

ttIf he were, he'd be over there

tThrough this Helmut remains silent -- his eyes focused on 
tthe coat.

<b>tttt  GALT
</b>ttThat's where he belongs.

tFranz and Keltner get to their feet.  Herman remains seated.

<b>tttt  FRANZ
</b>ttWhat're you so hot about?  It's no

ttWe've got a good reason for not liking

tThis surprises the men.  Herman gets to his feet.

</b>ttWhat'd you mean?

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttA bunch of them got picked up with 
ttpapers we'd sold them.   And what'd

tDeliberately, Franz hands his coat to Helmut.

</b>ttTake it, Doork -- anytime you want

tHelmut accepts the coat... nodding his head in the gracious 
tmanner of a ruler accepting homage from a faithful subject.  
tHe turns smartly and slowly struts away with as much dignity 
tas he can muster in his big shoes which flap with every step 
the takes.  The others stand and stare at Galt and Uhlmann.

<b>tttt  UHLMANN
</b>ttWhat's so terrible about what we

ttAnd what's more, we never charged

</b>
tAs Keltner catches up with Helmut.  The CAMERA MOVES BACK as 
tthey walk along the side of the barracks toward the door.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttI've been meaning to ask you.  Heard 
ttanymore about the request for a review 
ttof your case?

tHelmut doesn't hear him as he's deep in his own thoughts.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttDid you hear the laughs I got 
ttyesterday?

tKeltner nods.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttNot just from the children... but 
ttthe adults, too.

tYou know where a lot of clowns make a big mistake?  They 
tplay just for the children.

tThey forget... it's the parents, the adults that buy the 
ttickets.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttNever thought of that.

tHelmut stops, faces Keltner, a sly smile on his face.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttThey said I couldn't come up with 
ttanything new.

tKeltner looks puzzled.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttAt the circus.  Schmidt and the rest.  
ttWait'll they see my act now.  It's 
ttfunny.  Really funny.
ttt(a beat)
ttIsn't it?

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttThe children certainly enjoy it.

tHelmut begins to move along again with Keltner following.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttWhat I needed was time.  Time to 
ttconcentrate on new material.  A man's 
ttgot to have time alone.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttt(glancing around)
ttYou call this being alone?

tHelmut takes a few more steps then stops short.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttDo you think... maybe... they'd let 
ttme go to other camps and entertain?

tKeltner is about to say something... but shrugs his shoulders.  
tHe knows there's not much point in trying to make Helmut 
tlook at things the way they really are.  Helmut starts to 
twalk again.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI'd have to get to the Commandant.  
ttWould need his permission.

tThey arrive at the steps to the barracks.  Helmut swings 
tFranz's coat over his shoulder as he starts up the steps.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttIf you have time later, I'd like you 
ttto see something I've been working 
tton.  I hunch down and do a tiny 
ttsoldier parading.  Think they'll 
ttlike it?

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttt(pointedly)
ttWho?  The adults?

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(matter of fact)
ttThe children, of course.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttI thought the smart clown only played 
ttto the adults.

tHelmut, caught in a contradiction of his own "theory" of 
tclowning, gives Keltner an annoyed look, then goes into the 
tbarracks letting the door slam behind him.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - KELTNER
</b>
tAs he stands at the bottom of the steps -- he shakes his 
thead and smiles as he marvels at the change taking place in 
tthe pompous Helmut as the little gentle clown within him 
tstruggles to emerge.

<b>ttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. PRISON YARD - PAN SHOT - CHILDREN - DAY
</b>
tThe CAMERA is PANNING across the faces of about forty children 
tbehind the fence as they watch Helmut o.s.  Some of them are 
tlaughing; some clapping; some squealing with glee, and a few 
tjust watching quietly, but with laughter in their eyes.  
tBehind them, near the barracks on the non-Aryan side, a number 
tof adults also are looking on, but they hang back, fearful 
tthat getting too close to the fence might provoke the always 
tanticipated wrath of the guards.

<b>tEXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY
</b>
tWe see now that Helmut on his side of the fence is performing 
tfor the children on the other side of the menacing barbed 
twire fence.  Behind him, also at a safe distance because 
tthey still aren't certain of the official reaction to all of 
tthis, a number of his fellow political prisoners are watching 
this antics.  But, in spite of his talk about the importance 
tof playing to the adults -- it is the children that Helmut 
tplays to -- and it is for their laughter that he listens.  
tThe CAMERA MOVES IN to --

<b>tMED. FULL SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tAnd we see that he has used the chalk to whiten his face.  
tWith charcoal he has blackened his eyebrows, formed a wide 
tblack mouth and drawn lines down over his eyelids to his 
tcheekbones, giving him the appearance of a clown at once sad 
tand happy.  At the moment he is coatless, but Franz's coast 
tlies nearby on the ground.  For the stunt he is doing now 
tHelmut carries the remains of an old broom and a piece of 
tcardboard.  He is trying to sweep a small heap of dirt he 
thas gathered onto the cardboard, but each time he tries, the 
tdirt goes over the cardboard and he must sweep it into a 
tpile again.  After a few attempts he feigns exasperation and 
tponders the problem.  Inspiration comes.  He sweeps the dirt 
tinto a pile again, bends over and very carefully sweeps it 
tinto the front of one of his shoes, holding up the split top 
tto let it in.  This accomplished, he is very proud of himself, 
tbut when he tries to take a step, some of the dirt comes 
tout.  Frustrated, he ponders again, and again has an 
tinspiration.  He removes the shoe and puts it under his arm.  
tBut as he walks away with it, all the dirt slides out through 
tthe open toe.  The children roar with delight.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL
</b>
tShe is a flaxen-haired youngster of about five who holds a 
tweathered rag doll as she jumps up and down for sheer joy at 
tHelmut's performance.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY
</b>
tHe is a completely delighted boy of perhaps seven.  Each 
ttime Helmut does something he particularly enjoys he hugs 
thimself and spins around.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - BROTHER AND SISTER
</b>
tThe girl is no more than four; the boy about eight.  He clings 
tto her hand as they watch Helmut, unsmiling, perhaps not 
tunderstanding.  The boy looks at his sister, and a tiny smile 
ttugs at her mouth.  The boy smiles back.  The girl giggles.  
tThe boy laughs outright.  They have re-discovered happiness.

tThey look back at Helmut, both laughing.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - SISTERS
</b>
tThe older girl is ten or eleven; her sister five or six, 
ttugs at her arm, and the older girl bends down to her.  The 
tyounger girl whispers to her, pointing to Helmut, and the 
tolder girl picks her up.  The little one puts her arms tightly 
taround her sister's neck.  Both laugh merrily.

<b>tMED. FULL SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tHe is putting on Franz's too-small jacket.  He tries to button 
tit, but it won't go around him.  He sucks in his belly, but 
tthen his pants begin to slip, and he grabs at them with an 
tembarrassed look at the laughing children.

tDeciding that the only way to button the coat is to hunch 
this shoulders, he tries that, but now his shoulders must 
tremain hunched.  He manages to pick up the broom and puts it 
tover his shoulder, playing soldier.  But when he tries to 
tsnap to attention, the coat pops open again, bringing another 
troar of laughter from Helmut's audience.

tNow he marches a few steps toward the CAMERA, stops, snappily 
tputs the rifle down at rest position and salutes -- knocking 
thimself flat.  Another roar of laughter.  As it swells, we --

<b>tPAN SHOT - JEWISH PRISONERS
</b>
tThe laughter o.s. continues to swell as the CAMERA PANS across 
tthe faces of the adult Jewish prisoners huddled near their 
thuts.  They smile, fearfully at first, then break into 
ttimorous laughter.

<b>tARYAN PRISONERS - PAN SHOT
</b>
tAs the laughter swells even more, the CAMERA MOVES over the 
tfaces of the political prisoners on Helmut's side of the 
tcamp.  They, too, are laughing -- some tolerantly; some at 
tHelmut rather than with him, but they are laughing.

tAs the laughter continues to SWELL, the CAMERA PANS over to 
tyard-guard.  He is trying very hard not to laugh.  The result 
tis a self-conscious giggle.

tAs the laughter grows even louder, the CAMERA PANS as though 
twafted on the waves of laughter, up to a guardtower, and we 
tsee two rifle-armed soldiers in the tower watching the 
tperformance below them.  They gesture in Helmut's direction 
tand laugh.

tThe CAMERA continues to PAN over to the administration 
tbuilding and UP to an open window on the second floor.

<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:

tLT. SCHARFF, handsome, mid-30's, stands with his back to

toffice.  The window through which he is looking opens onto 
tthe prison yard.  An AIDE pokes his head in the doorway.

<b>tttt  AIDE

tAs Scharff comes through the door from the adjoining room.

tScharff closes the door and moves over to stand near the

<b>tttt  BESTLER
</b>ttI don't have to tell you why your

tthere. This prison is a disgrace.  
ttDisgrace! The latitude allowed by

ttUnderstand?

tScharff nods his head.  Bestler gets up from the desk and 
twalks around it.

</b>ttThat includes the staff.  I'm going 
ttto turn this place into a model

ttUnderstand?

tScharff again nods his head.

<b>tttt  BESTLER
</b>ttSpeak up.

<b>tttt  SCHARFF
</b>ttYes, Colonel.

tBestler returns to his desk, sits, and opens a folder.  He 
tglances up to study Scharff.

<b>tttt  BESTLER
</b>ttThis isn't the first prison the SS

tto read from the papers in the folder.

</b>ttWork camps.

tAgain the SOUND of laughter from o.s. and Bestler looks 
tquickly at the window, irritated.  Scharff, uncertain of his 
tsuperior's reaction, tries to cover up.

<b>tttt  SCHARFF
</b>ttt(speaking a little

ttBut we have about 40 children, some

tShooting past the children in f.g. to Helmut through the

twe can see a number of soldier-guards coming through the 
tcordon of watching prisoners, and waving them to disperse.  
tThey do so reluctantly, as the guard from Helmut's barrack 
tmoves forward to Helmut, who is just about to start another 
troutine.

ttThat's all.  Show's over.  Everybody

</b>ttt(to Helmut)
ttGet back to the barrack.
ttt(to children)
ttYou heard me.  Show's over.

tThe children don't move, but stand staring at Helmut as if 
twaiting for him to tell them what to do.  This frustrates 
tthe guard, who isn't accustomed to being questioned.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttGo on.  Get away.

tStill the children refuse to budge.  Angry, the guard goes 
tclose to the fence, waving his arms at them.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttMove, damn it, before I come over 
ttthere and...

tThe youngsters scuttle back a few feet fearfully, but there 
tthey stop, their eyes still on Helmut.  The guard turns to 
tHelmut.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttGet them moving before somebody gets

tHelmut goes up to the fence and speaks to the children softly.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttThat's all the show for today.  Go 
ttback inside.

tThe children back away with long faces.  Finally convinced 
tthat Helmut is through, they turn and wander back toward 
ttheir barracks, but with many a backward look at him.  Helmut 
tcontinues to encourage them, as the guard looks on.

</b>ttThat's right now, go along.  I'll

</b>
tIt is a warm, sunny afternoon and most of the prisoners on 
tboth sides of the fence, are out warming their weary bones.  
tOn the Aryan side, a number of prisoners, including Ludwig 
tand Herman, are having a makeshift soccer game using a bound 
tbundle of rags for a ball.  They play with fierce rigor for 
tsuch emaciated men, yelling at each other and kicking up 
tclouds of dust as they try to work off their frustrations.  
tOn the non-Aryan side of the fence, the children, now about 
t50 in number, are grouped near the wire barricades staring 
tacross it, their faces dour.  It appears they are watching 
tthe game.

tThe CAMERA MOVES BACKWARD down the aisle between the bunks 
tas Helmut walks dejectedly down the aisle, nervously fingering 
this white ascot.  The barrack is empty except for Keltner, 
twho is arranging the sprouts of his potato plant over a little 
ttrellis of sticks.  Helmut turns and walks back up the aisle 
tto stand in front of Keltner.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI can't go out there.  I can't take

</b>ttThey'll get over it.  Disappointment

</b>ttI'm sure they have.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttt(holding up the plant)
ttIt's amazing how a thing like this 
ttcan feed off itself.  Think how lucky 
ttwe would be if we could do that.

tHelmut glances disinterestedly at the plant as he reaches up 
tto his bunk and brings down the coat belonging to Franz.  He 
tholds coat up for Keltner to see.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI sewed a button on.  Look all right?

ttFine.

tHelmut gently pats the coat, then folds it and puts it back

tKeltner nods.

tThe sentence trails off as Helmut realizes how useless his

</b>ttHow can I!  They were my own very

</b>ttI'm going to ask you a question,

tHelmut nods.

</b>ttReason?  When war is waged against

ttAnd it will, believe me, it will.

tKeltner puts his arm around Helmut's shoulder.  Helmut grins, 
ta broad grin of thanks.

</b>ttSo, come on, Doork the Great, let's

tThey both walk quickly to the door.

tAs Keltner and Helmut come out.  In the b.g. we can see the

tat each other.  Keltner surveys the scene for a moment.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttWait here.

tHe moves down the line of barracks toward the mess hall.

<b>tEXT. PRISON YARD - FULL SHOT - DAY
</b>
tAs Keltner moves among the men lounging around the barracks, 
ttalking and watching the soccer game.  Trying to appear as 
tnonchalant as possible, we whispers something to a group of 
tprisoners.  They glance back at Helmut and then nod.  Keltner 
tmoves on to another group, taking care to avoid the two yard 
tguards, one of which is the guard in charge of Barrack "H".  
tAgain Keltner murmurs something to the other prisoners, and 
tagain they look at Helmut and nod assent.  Keltner goes on 
tto another group.  As he does, the men in the first group 
tcasually disperse and start across the yard toward the fence, 
tmoving around the soccer players.  One of them goes up to 
tLudwig, who is playing in the match, and whispers something 
tto him.  Ludwig nods, and the other prisoners move away.  
tLudwig runs off chasing the "ball".

tas he storms into a clutch of players, including Galt, all 
tkicking at the "ball".

</b>
tAs Keltner's plot takes shape, we see a dozen or so prisoners 
twander, apparently aimlessly, across the yard and form a 
tspectator's section for the soccer game with their backs to 
tthe fence, thus providing a shield between the children and 
tthe guards.  The game picks up tempo, but the play somehow 
tstays in the center of the yard, strengthening the shield.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tAs he watches the plan in action.  Keltner rejoins him.

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttYou know what to do?

tHelmut nods.

</b>ttStay behind the men and keep an eye

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttRight.

</b>ttMake it quick.  You won't have much 
tttime.

tHelmut nods again and starts away, but Keltner stops him

<b>tttt  KELTNER
</b>ttAnd Helmut, keep the children quiet.  
ttWe don't want trouble.

tHelmut nods and moves off across the yard.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS 
thim as he circles around the soccer players, trying to look 
tas if he is just wandering over to join the other spectators.  
tAs he nears the other side, the children spot him and react, 
tpressing closer to the fence and pointing to him.

<b>tMED. LONG SHOT - HELMUT

tShooting past the children in f.g. toward Helmut as he nears 
tthe line of prisoners, who continue to ad lib shouts of 
tderision and encouragement to the soccer players.  The

tputs his fingers to his lips to silence them and takes his 
tplace in the line with his back to them.

tas he stands pretending to watch the soccer game with the 
tothers.

<b>tttt  HELMUT

ttKick it, Ludwig.  Kick it!

tThe prisoner next to him gives him a sidelong glance and 
tnods almost imperceptibly.  Quickly, Helmut ducks behind the 
tline.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tBehind the line as he scurries, bending over, to the fence.  
tThe children flock to him.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS him to the 
tfence.

<b>tttt  CHILDREN
</b>ttDoork, Doork, Doork is back.  It's 
ttDoork.  It's Doork.

tHelmut tries to silence their squeals of delight.  Holding a 
tfinger to his lips:

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttShhh.  Shhhh.  The guards...

tThe children quiet down and press closer to the fence.  Helmut 
tdrops to his knees, looking around.

<b>tttt  CHILDREN
</b>ttDo a trick, Doork.  Please, Doork, 
ttplease, please.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttNo, no.  I can't.  The guards won't

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - LITTLE GIRL
</b>
tThis is the same flaxen-haired little five-year-old with a 
tdoll we saw before.  She regards Helmut solemnly.

<b>tttt  LITTLE GIRL
</b>ttThey're bad.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN
</b>
tSmiling wryly at the simplicity of this appraisal, Helmut 
treaches through the fence and pats the head of the girl's 
tdoll.

tEager to touch Helmut, another child take his hand, others 
tgrab at his arm.  Still other youngsters, following this 
tlead, try to reach through the fence to touch him.  Obviously 
tenjoying this adulation, Helmut takes as many of the little 
thands as he can, squeezing them affectionately.  Only one 
tgroup of eight children hangs back.  They do not seem to 
tunderstand what this is all about.  Their little faces are 
tfearful, yet they are fascinated by Helmut.  Suddenly one 
tlittle boy gives a yelp of pain and backs away from the wire, 
tclutching his forearm.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttWhat is it?  What happened?

<b>tttt  LITTLE GIRL
</b>ttHe hurt himself.

tWide-eyed with fright, the little boy takes his hand away 
tfrom his arm to reveal a nasty looking scratch from one of 
tthe barbs on the fence.  Seeing his own injury, the youngster 
tbursts into tears.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttShhh.  Shhh.  Don't cry.  It's going 
ttto be all right.
ttt(to the other children)
ttBe careful when you're near this 
ttfence.

tHe consoles the little boy, who continues to cry and holds 
tup his wounded arm for Helmut to see.  Helmut looks around 
tfrantically, as if hoping to find help somewhere.  Then he 
tquickly removes his ascot -- his precious trademark, the 
tsymbol of his self-accorded status -- and hands it through 
tthe fence.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttHere, wrap this around it.  I'll 
ttmake it all better.

tThe little boy goes on crying, but some of the other children 
ttake the cravat and fashion it into a crude bandage around 
tthe youngster's arm.  It fails to silence the boy's crying, 
thowever.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(worried)
ttHush now.  Stop crying.  Please.  
ttLook... Look at this.

tHe begins shuffling around on his knees, imitating a duck in 
tan effort to appease the crying child.  As he goes, Helmut 
tquacks softly.  The boy stops crying, but his face remains 
tunhappy.  The other children laugh in spite of Helmut's 
tefforts to keep them quiet, all but the group of eight 
tyoungsters who only stare at Helmut in awe.  Seeing that he 
tis making progress with the crying child, Helmut next pulls 
this coat up over his head and, still on his knees, moves 
taround like a headless man, groping ahead with his hands.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY
</b>
tHis frown gradually dissolves and, in spite of his sniffling, 
the smiles, timorously at first, then broadly.  Finally, he 
tlaughs.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN
</b>
tHelmut shrugs his jacket back into place and smiles at the 
tboy.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttThere, that's better.  No more crying 
ttnow.

tFor the first time he notices the other group of frowning 
tchildren.  Among the other smiling and laughing youngsters, 
tthey seem to stand out.  When Helmut fastens a quizzical 
tlook on them, they back away a little, fearfully.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttWhat's the matter with them?

<b>tttt  LITTLE GIRL
</b>ttThey're new.  We can't understand 
ttthem.  All they do is cry.

<b>tttt  OLDER BOY
</b>ttThey're all the way from 
ttCzechoslovakia.

tThe eight just start at him wordlessly, their fear naked in 
ttheir eyes.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(to the silent ones)
ttThere's nothing to be afraid of.  
ttEverything is all right.

tWhen there is no reaction from the children, who obviously 
tdon't understand him, Helmut looks over his shoulder, 
twondering if he has time.

<b>tMED. LONG SHOT - PRISONERS - HELMUT'S POV

tThe prisoners are still rooting for the soccer players, but 
tas Helmut looks, Adolf, in the middle of the cheering section, 
tturns and sees him.

<b>tttt  ADOLF
</b>ttt(a hushed call)
ttHurry up.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN
</b>
tHelmut nods to Adolf and then turns back to the youngsters, 
tafraid but still unable to tear himself away.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttHere.  Look.  I'll show you... No 
ttnoise now.

tIn pantomime, he pretends to pull a hair from his head and 
tthreads it through an imaginary needle.  Finally accomplishing 
tthis, he pretends to be sewing a button on his jacket, holding 
tthe thumb of his left hand under the button while he sews 
twith his right.  When he has finished, he pantomimes that he 
thas sews his thumb to the jacket.  He pretends to be 
tembarrassed and tries to hide his hand in his trouser pocket, 
tbut in order to put his hand in his pocket the jacket goes 
ttoo.  The children giggle, then roar with laughter at his 
tfrantic efforts to detach his thumb from his jacket.

tThe silent children press closer to watch Helmut's antics.  
tSome look at each other and smile, then grin.  Suddenly the 
tentire group is laughing.  Helmut holds up his hands for 
tsilence, but the grin on his face says he loves it.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttNo, no, be quiet.  Be quiet.  Shhh.  
ttShhhh.

tThe children go on laughing as if this is just part of the 
tgame.

<b>tMED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS
</b>
tThe SOUND of the children's laughter floats up to two guards 
tin a tower on the non-Aryan side of camp.  One of them, who 
thas been watching the soccer game below, nudges his partner 
tand points down to Helmut.

<b>tLONG SHOT - PRISON YARD - GUARDS' POV

tBetween the children at the fence and the line of soccer 
tspectators we can see only the top of Helmut's head bobbing 
tup and down.  But that is enough.

<b>tMED. LONG SHOT - TOWER GUARDS
</b>
tAfter a long look, one of the guards picks up a telephone 
tand starts to make a call.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN
</b>
tHelmut seems to have thrown caution away under the stimulus 
tof the children's laughter.  He is on his feet trying a hand 
tspring.  He lands flat on his back, but rolls over on his 
tside and grins broadly at his audience, which laughs 
tappreciatively.  This is the old Doork.  Their Doork.  Again 
tHelmut tries the hand spring and again he flops.

<b>tFULL SHOT - PRISON YARD
</b>
tA HIGH ANGLE with Helmut and the children in f.g. and beyond 
tthem the Aryan side of the yard.  The soccer game is still 
tin progress, with the spectators on both sides of the action 
twhooping it up.  Then in b.g. we see two soldiers, two SS 
tofficers, and the guard in charge of barracks "H", come 
tbursting through the spectators near the huts and into the 
tgame itself.  The players slowly subside as they realize 
twhat is happening.  They watch the guard cross the yard.  
tThe cheering trails off, and the yard becomes strangely quiet, 
tthe prisoners' warning to Helmut.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN
</b>
tOblivious to all this in his joy at performing for the 
tchildren again, Helmut is just pretending to slip on something 
tunderfoot.  His arms flay the air as he tries to regain his 
tbalance, but he falls.  Through this, however, the children 
tseem to be watching something behind Helmut, and when he 
tlands on the ground, they do not laugh.

tAgain their faces are frightened as they look o.s.  Helmut 
tlooks at them, puzzled.  Then, realizing that something is 
twrong, he turns and looks up from the ground.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
tSHOOTING PAST Helmut in f.g. toward the guard, SS men, and 
tsoldiers, who have come through the line of spectators and 
tstand glowering at him.  The prisoners have moved back, warily 
twatching for the next move.

<b>tttt  GUARD
</b>ttYou wouldn't listen, would you?

tAlmost wearily, he goes to the fence.  This isn't something 
the likes, but his authority is at stake here, and he has no 
tchoice.  As the CAMERA PANS him to the fence we see that 
tsome non-Aryan adults have drifted over to see what the 
tdisturbance is.

tThe adults begin to gather up the children.

</b>ttThey had nothing to do with it.  It

tThe guard turns and comes up to face Helmut.  He studies him 
tfor a moment, then hits him a vicious backhand slap across 
tthe face.  Taken by surprise, Helmut staggers backward and 
tfalls.  A murmur runs through the prisoners.  The children 
tstill near the fence, cry out with alarm.  Seeing their 
tterror, Helmut is determined to make it look like just another 
tact.  With a painful effort he gets to his feet, smiles at 
tthe children, turns and salutes the guard, knocking himself 
tdown again.  A couple of children giggle.  The FIRST SS 
tOFFICER quickly steps forward to stand behind the guard.

tHe holds a swagger stick in his right hand, which he 
trepeatedly whacks into the palm of his left hand.  He looks 
tdown at Helmut.

tHelmut struggles to his feet.  He glances over at the 
tchildren.  They are all watching him.  He takes a deep breath, 
twinks at the little ones, then salaams before the SS Officer 
tand the guard.  Some of the children giggle.  This infuriates 
tthe SS officer.  He raises the swagger stick and brings it 
tdown hard on Helmut's head knocking him to his knees.  The 
tchildren scream with terror.  The SS Officer raises the stick 
tto hit Helmut again, but Keltner, in an almost instinctive 
treaction, catches hold of his arm.

tto take Helmut away.  The First SS Officer, still panting 
twith exhaustion, shows his approval of the action taken by 
tthe guard.  The two guards seize Helmut by the arms and begin 
tdragging him off toward the administration building.  The 
tprisoners move away before the guards holding Helmut, forming 
ta sort of line of march for them.  As they drag Helmut along, 
the waves back at the children, makes a funny face and moves

tHelmut moves over to the half open door of the boxcar, the

tputs a wide grin on his face.  But when he does peer into 
tthe car, his eyes cease to smile.

<b>tINT. BOXCAR - HELMUT'S POV - DAY

tIn one end of the car the children are huddled together in 
tone frightened, wailing mass.  They do not even notice Helmut 
tat first, so great is their sorrow.  The little ones cling 
tto the larger youngsters, who, in turn, cling together.  The 
tsmall ones weep hysterically , as children do when they have 
tbeen crying for a very long time.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK so 
tthat Helmut is in f.g.   He slides the boxcar door open fully, 
tthrowing more light on the children.  This brings renewed 
twalls of anguish from the youngsters, who cluster together 
tmore fiercely.  But one little boy sneaks a look at the door, 
texpecting to see more guards.  When he sees Helmut, his tear-
tfilled eyes widen.  He can scarcely believe what he sees, 
tmuch less verbalize it.  He tugs frantically at an OLDER 
tGIRL he has been clutching.  She looks first at him, then at 
tHelmut.  She, too, can hardly believe it.

tcan only stare at Helmut, speechless with wonder.

tyoungsters surge toward him.  The little boy who first saw 
thim reaches him first.  He drops to his knees and puts his 
tarms around Helmut's neck, hugging him furiously.  Helmut 
treturns the embrace.

tHe backs up a few steps, the CAMERA PULLING BACK with him.  
tThen he runs toward the car and, with strength he really 
tdoesn't have, jumps up so that he gets his arms on the floor 
tof the boxcar.  He heaves himself forward partially into it, 
tand the children grab his clothes to help him inside.  A

tfinally pull him in.

tthe Czech youngsters, until all are waggling their heads at

tyoungest of the children close in on Helmut and hug him around 
this legs.  Slowly he stops waggling his head and stretches 
tout his arms to embrace as many of them as he can -- almost 
tas if trying to protect them.  Suddenly the gaiety dissolves, 
tand the children go solemnly silent.  Helmut reacts.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttWell... who's hungry.

tAlmost in unison, the children shout "I am", again forgetting 
ttheir unhappiness.

</b>ttOh, you're too fast.  Three!

tThis brings a burst of giggles, and the remaining children, 
tsit down... the Czechs following the example of the others.  
tHelmut opens the burlap sack and begins handing out pieces 
tof black bread.  The children grab at the chunks and gnaw it 
tvoraciously.  When all of the youngsters have been given the 
tbread, Helmut takes a piece and bites into it with great 
trelish.  After a few chews on the bread:

</b>ttHer?

</b>ttFrederika.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(mock dismay)
ttFrederika?

tHe studies the top of doll's tiny head.  Then he holds up 
this hand and measures off a distance of about three inches 
tin the air with thumb and forefinger.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttFrederika!

tNext he puts the doll's head between his thumb and forefinger, 
tillustrating that the head is too small for the name.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttCouldn't we just make it Freda?

<b>tttt  LITTLE GIRL
</b>ttt(solemnly)
ttOh, no!  Frederika.

tHelmut shrugs, closes one eye and begins writing in tiny 
tletters on the doll's head.  The children laugh delightedly.

<b>tMED. SHOT - SERGEANT HOFFMAN

tFrom within the boxcar we can HEAR Helmut SINGING softly to 
tthe children.  Sergeant Hoffman is listening.  Finally he 
ttakes something from his pocket, goes to the door of the 
tboxcar and sticks his head inside.

tThe children are scattered about, either sleeping or near

tHe leans back and looks at the harmonica, then he has a sudden 
tthought as Hoffman's head disappears.  He leans back toward 
tthe door.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttGuard... guard.

tHoffman reappears at door.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttIt's going to be dark soon.  The

ttI would if I could.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI know.  I know you would.

tAgain Hoffman's face disappears.  Helmut leans back and begins 
texperimenting with the harmonica.  Actually he can play it 
tonly slightly, but he manages to get some sort of soft tune 
tout of it.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to include the 
tchildren, most of who are resting peacefully, secure in 
tHelmut's presence.  But suddenly a little dark haired, dark-
teyed girl of about six, sits upright and cries out, frightened 
tby a bad dream.  Helmut reacts.  The child looks around the 
tboxcar as if she can't remember how she got there and begins 
tcrying inconsolably.  Some of the other children stir.  Helmut 
tquickly but carefully disengages himself from the tots around 
thim and picks his way over to the girl.  He kneels beside 
ther, and the CAMERA MOVES UP to --

ttWhat's the matter?
ttt(she only stares at

ttIt's all right -- just a bad dream.

tHe tries to put a comforting arm around her, but she shrinks 
taway continuing to sob softly.  Realizing that words won't 
thelp, he turns to the harmonica for communication, serenading 
ther with a soft but sprightly tune of his own improvisation.  
tIt is hardly a masterpiece, but it has the desired effect.  
tThe girl stops sobbing, and when Helmut finishes the tune he 
tmakes a real funny face and she timorously puts a hand up to 
ttouch his make-up, but pulls it back quickly.  With an 
taffectionate smile, Helmut takes her hand and runs it over 
this face, pretending that her touch tickles him.  As he 
tlaughs, the child begins to smile faintly.  He shows her the 
ttraces of chalk make-up on her fingers, and she giggles.  
tHis conquest is all but complete.  He picks the youngster 
tup, and holding her like a dancing partner, pretends to dance 
twith her to a little tune he hums.  She loves this and laughs 
toutright.  When Helmut finally puts her down, he kisses her 
ton the cheek and turns his cheek in an unspoken request for 
ta return kiss.  The girl shyly and quickly gives Helmut's 
tcheek a peck.  Grinning, Helmut pats the spot where she kissed 
thim to show his appreciation for her wonderful gift.

twith the dejection of a lad who has just lost everything.  
tThe other little Czechs and the older girl who first

tto console him.  Between cooing and patting the boy's

tgets up and goes to the children.

</b>ttWhat's this now?  Crying?  After all

tthis.

</b>ttWhat date is this?

<b>tttt  GIRL
</b>ttt(after thinking it

ttWhy, it's his birthday!

tThis is too much for Helmut to fathom.  He turns his head 
taway, trying to think.

</b>ttDon't you believe him?

tHelmut turns back to them, looking first at the girl, then 
tat the boy, his little upturned tear-stained face full of 
twonder.  Helmut softens, recalling perhaps his own birthday 
tdisappointment.

ttTell him I wish him a happy birthday.

tThe boy looks solemnly at Helmut and the harmonica.  He 
tdoesn't quite seem to understand what this is all about, but 
tthe harmonica is enticing.  He looks up at his countrymen 
tfor encouragement.  They smile at him, and he takes the 
tharmonica, examines it, then blows into it experimentally.  
tWhen he hears the SOUND that comes out, he brightens.  Then 
tthe little girl with the rag doll comes forward and offers 
tit to the boy.  He looks at her strangely, one of the older 
tGerman boys scoffs.

tHe takes the doll and puts one of it's hands in the boy's 
thand, the other in the little girl's.  They stand looking at

tdoor apprehensively, but there seems to be no action outside -- 
tand there are the eyes of the children on him.

</b>ttEverybody line up behind me now, and 
ttI'll show you how a train goes.

tHelmut looks around for the new owner of the harmonica.  He 
tgoes over to him.

tFinally the boy hands over the harmonica and manages a smile 
tbecause he sees all the other children smiling at him.

</b>ttGood.  Now everybody...  line up

tThe children scramble into line behind him.  Helmut looks

tThe children, laughing and giggling, grab hold of one another.

</b>ttt(calling out)
ttAll aboard.  All aboard.

tHe puts the harmonica to his lips and begins huffing and 
tpuffing on it, imitating a train.  He begins to shuffle his 
tfeet and move slowly down the side of the car... the children 
tholding on for dear life and following him... their eyes 
tshining with expectation as Helmut begins to quicken his 
tpace.

</b>
tBut the train NOISES drown his voice.  Then the boxcar 
tsuddenly lurches and starts to move forward.  Helmut's 
tpounding weakens and stops.  He turns from the door, his 
tface reflecting his fright.  The children, not quite 
tunderstanding what has happened, gather around him, and pull 
ton him.  He manages to control his fear, and looking at the 
tchildren, he manages a big smile.

</b>ttGuess I'm going with you after all.

tHe switches on the lantern and holds it high so its rays 
tcover all the children.

<b>tttt  SERGEANT
</b>ttWhat'd you expect?

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI thought the children were going to 
tta better place.

tThe Sergeant, with an incredulous look on his face, stares 
tat Helmut.

<b>tINT. CELL - DAY
</b>
tThe cell is a small, bare cubicle containing only a cot and 
tan open toilet.  In the wall, fronting on the prison yard, 
tthere is a small barred window.  Helmut stops pacing and 
tmoves over to it, and looks out.  The CAMERA SWINGS so that 
tit is SHOOTING PAST Helmut's head through the window.  At 
tthe far end of the yard we can see the windowless stone 
tbuildings.  As Helmut stares out at them, we HEAR approaching 
tfootsteps. Helmut stiffens, turns toward the door as the 
tSOUND of the footsteps grows louder and louder.

tThe CAMERA SWINGS toward the door as it opens to reveal 
tCAPTAIN CURT RUNKEL, a slender, impeccably groomed and 
tthoroughly Nazified officer of the elite S.S.  He is the 
tembodiment of all Hitlerian ideals.  Runkel strides into the 
tcell.

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttt(over shoulder to 
tttguard at door)
ttClose the door, and wait out there.

tGuard closes the door.  Runkel studies Helmut coldly.  Without 
ttaking his eyes off Helmut, he pulls out a cigarette case, 
ttakes out cigarette, lights it and slowly inhales.

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttYou're a remarkable man.  Very 
ttremarkable.

tHelmut stirs uneasily.

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttHave you any idea where you are?

tHelmut shakes his head.

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttAuschwitz.  This is Auschwitz.
ttt(a beat)
ttMean anything to you?
ttt(before Helmut can 
tttanswer)
ttYou may have observed we're enlarging 
ttour facilities.

tHe moves over to the window and looks out, puffing slowly on 
this cigarette.

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttStill a great deal of work to be 
ttdone.
ttt(proudly)
ttIt's going to be our most efficient, 
ttmost modern prison.
ttt(he turns and smiles)
ttAnd, I might add, most unique.
ttt(walks back towards 
tttHelmut, studying him 
tttcarefully)

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttYes, you are a remarkable man.  I 
ttalways wonder about remarkable men.
ttt(then evenly)
ttWhy did you come here?

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI explained.  I got locked in the 
ttboxcar and...

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttt(cuts in - still bland)
ttAh, yes.  An accident.  Unavoidable 
ttI suppose.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI was taking care -- I mean, the 
ttCommandant requested me to take care 
ttof the children.

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttt(a slight note of 
tttmockery)
ttThe Commandant!

tRunkel tosses his cigarette on the floor and very deliberately 
tgrinds it out with his boot.

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttI've spoken to YOUR Commandant.  He 
tths you listed as an escaped prisoner.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttEscaped!  But...

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttt(finishing it for him)
tt... it was an accident.
ttt(his face close to 
tttHelmut's)
ttAre you one of them, clown?

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(terrorized at the 
tttthought of death)
ttNo... no!  I'm not one of them.  I'm 
ttnot !

tRunkel smiles, moves away from Helmut.

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttYou misunderstand completely.  The 
ttJudas goat is never killed.  He isn't 
ttworth killing.
ttt(moves to cell door)
ttI'm just asking you to lead them.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING HELMUT
</b>
tHis eyes plead, "No.  I can't do it.  No."

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttNot... even to save your own life?

tFor a brief moment, Helmut struggles to find the courage to 
tstand up to Runkel -- but he has no courage and he sinks 
tslowly to his knees, his head bowed.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - RUNKEL
</b>
<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttt(victorious)
ttI'm glad to see you're not a self-
ttappointed martyr.

<b>tTWO SHOT - HELMUT, RUNKEL
</b>
tRunkel towers above Helmut who sits back on his haunches, 
tleaning against the wall.

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttJust think!  Now you're really one 
ttof us.

tThe truth of Runkel's remark hits Helmut like a devastating 
tblow.   He turns his face to the wall in shame.  Runkel walks 
tto the door, raps on it, the guard outside swings it open.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(attempting to get to 
ttthis feet)
ttSir... Sir... could I... could I 
tthave a little time with them before 
tt... before...

tHis voice trails off.  Runkel looks at Helmut while he thinks 
tit over.  He moves back to the middle of the cell.

<b>tttt  RUNKEL
</b>ttYes.  Yes, of course.
ttt(he looks at his watch)
ttI can give you about half an hour.
ttt(a little smile lights 
ttthis face)
ttYou see, we're not heartless men 
tthere.

<b>ttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:

<b>tEXT. CHILDRENS' HUT - DAY
</b>
tANGLE to the door as Helmut and the Sergeant approach from 
to.s.  Helmut has freshened his make-up.

<b>tttt  SERGEANT
</b>ttRemember what I told you.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttThere won't be any trouble.

tHelmut goes to the door and starts to open it.  The CAMERA 
tMOVES UP to --

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tWith a great effort, he composes himself and throws open the 
tdoor.

<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CHILDRENS' HUT - DAY
</b>
tANGLE to the door, where Helmut stands wearing an enormous 
tgrin.  The children are about the barren room in little 
tgroups.  When they see Helmut, they leap up and run to him, 
tclinging to him as he closes the door behind him and moves 
tinto the room.

<b>tttt  CHILDREN
</b>ttDoork, Doork, you came back.  You 
ttcame back.  We thought you'd left 
ttus.  Don't leave us, Doork.

tThe children continue to ad lib expressions of mingled fear 
tand delight at his return.  Helmut goes among them, patting 
ttheir heads comfortingly.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttThere.  There.  It's all right. It's 
ttall right.   Everything is going to 
ttbe all right.

tWhen the youngsters are calmed, Helmut holds up his hands 
tfor silence.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttNow I want everyone to put on a big 
ttsmile and sit down, because we're 
ttgoing to have more fun than we've 
ttever had.

tSlowly, still unconvinced that they have nothing to fear, 
tthe children sit on the floor.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttGood.  We'll start by seeing that we 
ttall have our names on our heads.

tThe children begin to lower their heads so Helmut can check 
tto see if their names are still there.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(as he moves among 
tttthem)
ttYes, yes.  There's Fritz, Maria, 
ttSadie, Inga, Josef, Nathan, Helga, 
ttWillie...

tThe little girl with the rag doll holds up the doll for Helmut 
tto see.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttAh, yes, Frederika!  Good.  I see 
ttall of your names.

tThis is almost too much for Helmut, but he manages to control 
thimself by turning away for a beat.  Then he turns back to 
tthe children, his big smile back in place.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttNow... on with the show.  Just watch 
ttthis.

<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:

</b>
tTheir little faces are troubled, worried.

<b>ttttttt   DISSOLVE TO:

</b>
tIt is a half hour later, and now the children are laughing 
tat something Helmut is doing o.s.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to --

<b>tMED. SHOT - THE GROUP
</b>
tHelmut is walking an imaginary tightrope.  Every few steps 
the almost loses his balance, but with comical gyrations he 
tmanages to complete the walk.  He bows deeply to the children -- 
tand falls flat on his face.  The youngsters laugh, applaud 
tand squeal delightedly.

<b>tTWO SHOT - HELMUT, WILLIE
</b>
tHelmut is lying on the floor near the boy.  He looks up at 
tthe tot and grins.

<b>tttt  WILLIE
</b>ttDoork!  Doork... you're great !

tHelmut grabs Willie and holds him close while he fights back 
this tears.   Willie plants a big kiss on his cheek.  Helmut 
tscrambles to his feet, the CAMERA PULLING BACK to --

<b>tWIDER ANGLE
</b>
tSHOOTING PAST Helmut to the door as it opens, revealing the 
tSergeant, his face expressionless.  Helmut reacts.

<b>tttt  SERGEANT
</b>ttt(to Helmut)
ttIt's time.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttJust a few more minutes?

tThe sergeant shakes his head.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttI'll bring them.

tThe children are watching him, puzzled.

<b>tttt  CHILDREN
</b>ttWhat's the matter, Doork?  Where are 
ttwe going?  You come with us this 
tttime.  Where're they taking us.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(trying to think what 
tttto say)
ttThey... they want us to move to 
ttanother building... where we'll have 
ttmore room... to play.
ttt(a beat)
ttTell you what.  Let's make it a big 
ttcircus parade.  Everybody get in a 
ttline behind...

tHe picks up Willie and stands him near the door.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttt(continuing)
tt... behind Willie here.

tThe children scramble up and begin forming a line behind the 
tvery proud Willie.  Helmut looks around for the boy with the 
tharmonica.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttNow, where's our band?  The harmonica?

tHe sees the boy and goes to him.  Helmut pantomimes playing 
tthe harmonica and points to himself.  The boy smiles widely, 
tfishes the harmonica out of his pocket and holds it up.

<b>tttt  HELMUT
</b>ttThere we are?  Everybody ready?  
ttHere we go.

tHelmut takes his place at the head of the line, like the 
tPied Piper, leads the youngsters out the door, playing a 
tcrude sort of circus parade music.  The little children giggle 
texcitedly as they troupe out.  The older ones seem less 
tcertain, but as long as Helmut is with them, they feel secure.

<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
</b>
tAs the procession of youngsters emerges from the barracks 
twith Helmut dancing along at its head.  The Sergeant and the 
tother two Guards stand watching in disbelief as the line 
tturns and moves along toward the first of the windowless 
tbuildings.

<b>tMED. SHOT - SERGEANT, GUARDS
</b>
tThey look at each other incredulously.  What they are seeing 
tsurpasses their imagination.

<b>tFULL SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN
</b>
tSHOOTING from a HIGH ANGLE as the procession moves toward 
tthe CAMERA.  Helmut looks back at his charges from time to 
ttime, smiling and waving and always puffing away on the 
tharmonica.  The children smile back, some timidly and some a 
tbit fearfully, but all smile.

<b>tPAN SHOT - PARADE
</b>
tCAMERA PANS in on the children as they march behind Helmut.  
tWe see some of them strutting, their little arms swinging 
tfreely.  Some of the little ones have to skip to keep up 
twith the others.  They are all smiling.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tWith each step, Helmut looks about, his eyes searching heaven, 
tpraying for the miracle that will save the children... the 
tsudden blast of thunder, the striking down of the guards.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - SERGEANT, GUARDS
</b>
tAs they follow the parade warily, almost as if expecting a 
ttrick.  They wear scowls worn into their faces by long use.

<b>tMED. SHOT - BUILDING - HELMUT'S POV
</b>
tIts steel door gapes open.  Through the open doorway we can 
tsee a bare room in which what appears to be shower heads 
tjutting from the wall.  A single ceiling light gives the 
troom a stark appearance.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK and UP as 
tthe procession comes up toward the building.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tDespair fills his eyes as he realizes that there is to be no 
tmiracle.  He looks ahead into the room, his courage fails 
thim and he stops so abruptly that the children behind him 
trun into his legs.  He turns and looks at them, then back to 
tthe door.

<b>tWIDER ANGLE
</b>
tAlmost reluctantly, Helmut stands aside.  He tries to smile, 
tbut the result is almost grotesque.  He tries to speak, but 
tno words come.  The Sergeant and the guard drift up toward 
thim, scowling.  Gently, Helmut tousles the hair of little 
tWillie and steers him through the door into the room.  The 
tother children follow him hesitantly.  Helmut puts the 
tharmonica to his lips and begins playing again.

<b>tANOTHER ANGLE - TAKING IN SERGEANT AND GUARDS
</b>
<b>tttt  FIRST GUARD
</b>ttTheir clothes!  They've got to 
ttundress.

tThe sergeant starts to move toward the line of children, the 
tSergeant grabs his arm and stops him.

<b>tttt  SERGEANT
</b>ttLeave them alone.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, CHILDREN
</b>
tSHOOTING over Helmut's shoulder down at the children as they 
tfile past him.  Each one hesitates a beat before him and 
tlooks up at him.

tTheir faces are wondering, but trusting.  They smile 
ttentatively.  Only the little girl with the doll hangs back, 
twaiting for something rather than fearful of entering.  When 
tall of the other children have gone in, she goes up to Helmut 
tand wordlessly holds out her hand in a silent request to 
tenter with him.  In her eyes is the absolute certainty that 
the will.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT - LITTLE GIRL'S POV
</b>
tHe looks down at her hand for a long beat.

<b>tMED. SHOT - HELMUT, LITTLE GIRL
</b>
tThe little girl waits for Helmut, but he doesn't take her 
thand.  Shyly, she begins to withdraw it.  Suddenly, Helmut 
treaches out and grabs her hand, clutching it desperately as 
the needs her innocence to control the panic that is tearing 
tat him.  Holding on to her to steady himself, they walk 
ttogether into the room, the CAMERA PANNING with them.

<b>tttttttt   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
tANGLE to the door as Helmut and little girl enter.  Suddenly, 
tthe door slams shut behind them.  Helmut whirls to it 
tinstinctively, as if to shove it open or cry out for help, 
tbut he does neither.

<b>tCLOSE SHOT - HELMUT
</b>
tHis face is pressed against the steel door.  He fights the 
tpanic within him.  Then, he quickly wipes his eyes and turns 
tback towards the children.  Slowly he takes three chunks of 
tstale bread from his coat pocket and begins juggling them, 
tat the same time waggling his head from side to side, slowly 
tat first, then more gaily.  From deep inside him comes a 
ttiny, tiny laugh.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to reveal 
tthe children in the f.g.  Suddenly, Helmut tosses the pieces 
tof bread high, high into the air and stretches out his arms 
tto encompass all the children.  As they gather around him, 
tthey take up his soft laugh, timidly at first, then more 
tassuredly until the chamber resounds with gentle laughter.
