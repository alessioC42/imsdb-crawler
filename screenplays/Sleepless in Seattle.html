tNext to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9.  Sam's hand is on

tThe same stunning architecture in the b.g.  They go up

tA large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high-

trise.  Lake Michigan out the window.  A large space with 

tseveral architects consulting, drafting, etc.  Sam is at 

this desk, working.  An older colleague, ROB, comes over 

tto him.  Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind 

tbut a little stuffy.



<b>tttt ROB
</b>
tt    Young man, it's none of my

tt    I used to be up tight.



tOn Sam's face.  It's hard to imagine Rob being any more 

tuptight than he is.  Sam takes some business cards out

tHe stops, realizing that everyone in the room is staring 

tat him.  Quickly they pretend they weren't paying 

tattention.  Someone whispers something to a client.



<b>tttt SAM

ttt   (beat)

tt    What I really think is we need

tt    It's silly, really.  I mean, 

tt    I'd seen him at the office, 

tt    obviously I'd seen him, he's 

tt    the associate publisher, and 

tt    then one day we both ordered 

tt    sandwiches from the same place, 

tt    and he got my lettuce and 

tt    tomato sandwich on whole wheat, 

tt    which of course he was allergic

tt    through my head.  But after a

tAnnie nods.



tSam holds out his hand.

tHe looks at her.



<b>tttt ANNIE

tt    It's nice to meet you.



tOn Annie.



tOn Sam.



tOn Jonah.  He makes a triumphant little double-fist 

tgesture to himself as the elevator doors close.
