</b>The Battle of Algiers


<b>1tVILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. NIGHT. 
</b>
tInside a three-story villa, just built, with whitewashed walls. 
tAn elevator shaft is empty, the large cables dangle. 

tOn every landing two apartments. The front doors are wide open.
tWhitewash on the floor of the halls, swirls of whitewash on the 
twindowpanes, naked light bulbs hung from electric wires. The rooms 
tcontain hardly any furnishings. 

tThe kitchens are still without sinks and stoves.
<b>  
</b>tAn agitated bustle, a rhythm of efficiency. Paratroopers go up and 
tdown the stairs, pass along the halls, enter and leave the rooms.

tThe sounds in the background are indecipherable.

<b>tSHOUTED ORDERS, CRIES, HOWLS. 
</b>
<b>tSHOUTS, HALF-SPOKEN REMARKS, LAUGHS.
</b>
<b>tSOMEWHERE A GRAMOPHONE IS PLAYING AT FULL BLAST. 
</b>
tThe scene is tense. No pauses.
<b> 
</b>tWhen the paras are tired, they move to another room. 

tThey sit down, stretch out on the floor, drink coffee or beer, and 
tsmoke cigarettes while awaiting the next shift. Suddenly, the rhythm 
tof this routine, the timing of these images is upset. A para rushes 
tdown the stairs, and asks cheerfully while running:

<b>ttttMARC
</b>ttThe colonel. Where's the colonel? 

<b>ttttPARAS
</b>ttWhy? What's happening?

<b>ttttMARC 
</b>ttWe know where Ali la Pointe is. One of 
ttthem "spoke" ...

tHis voice echoes through the corridors, on the landings, from one 
tfloor to another. The excitement is contagious. Many crowd around 
tthe door of the kitchen.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian who has "spoken" is there. He is young with a thin face 
tand feverish eyes. The paras are all around him: they help him stand 
tup, dry him, clean his face with a rag, give him some coffee in a 
tthermos cover. They are full of attention, sincerely concerned. One 
tof them tries to push away the others.

<b>ttttPARA 
</b>ttC'mon, let him breathe!

tMeanwhile others who are arriving ask if it is true. 

<b>ttttOTHER PARAS
</b>ttSo he spoke? Does he really know where 
ttAli is?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMARC 
</b>ttIt seems so. We'll go see. Give him a 
ttlittle coffee. 

tMarc is tall and husky, his eyes young and cheerful. One of the others 
tasks him with a shade of admiration:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttPARA 
</b>ttHey Marc, you made him talk?
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMARC 
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttSure.
<b> 
</b>tHe then begins to smoke again, and moves aside to rest a bit. The 
tAlgerian is trying to drink, but his hands are trembling. Someone 
thelps him and holds still the cover of the thermos, drawing it to his 
tmouth:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttLAGLOY 
</b>ttC'mon Sadek ... Drink, you'll feel better. 

tThe Algerian drinks, but his stomach can't take it, causing him to 
tdouble over and vomit again. 

tColonel Mathieu enters, elegant and graceful.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttAt ease. Is it true? 

<b>ttttMARC 
</b>ttI think so. Rue des Abderames three ...
<b> 
</b>tThe colonel turns to the para, who had gone to call him, and who is 
tholding a pair of camouflage fatigues in his hands. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttDress him.

tThen he goes near the Algerian, lifts his chin, inspects him for a 
tmoment with curiosity.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttChin up, it's all over. Nothing can happen 
ttto you now, you'll see. Can you stand up?
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian nods yes. The colonel turns to the paras who are holding 
thim up. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttLet him go.

tHe takes the camouflage fatigues and hands them to the Algerian.

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttHere, put them on.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian mechanically takes the fatigues, but he doesn't 
tunderstand. The colonel explains to him:

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttWe're trying to help you. We're going to 
ttthe Casbah. Dressed like this, they won't 
ttbe able to recognize you. Understand? 
ttWe're going to see the place, then you'll 
ttbe free ... and under our protection ...

tThe Algerian shivers from the cold. He is completely naked. He 
tlaboriously puts on the fatigues which are too big for him. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttGo on, give him the cap.

tThey give him a wide belt and buckle it. The other paras, one on either 
tside of him, pull up his sleeves to the elbows. A third places the cap 
ton his head and cocks it. 

<b>ttttLAGLOY 
</b>ttNationalized!
<b>      
</b>tThe colonel turn to him angrily: 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttDon't be an idiot, Lagloy!
<b>     
</b>tThe Algerian is ready. The paras look at him repressing their laughter. 
tThe Algerian continues to tremble. His breath is short, his eyes 
tglossy. He is crying.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttLet's go.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian looks around. He breathes deeply. Then, suddenly, 
tunexpectedly, he lets out a hoarse cry:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttSADEK 
</b>ttNo!
<b> 
</b> tand tries to jerk forward toward the window.

tMarc seizes him immediately, and with his right hand grabs him by the 
tchest, almost lifting him. With his left hand he gives him two quick 
tslaps, not very hard.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMARC 
</b>ttt(persuadingly)
ttWhat do you think you're doing, you fool? 
ttDo you want us to start all over again? 
ttC'mon, be good. Don't make me look like 
ttan idiot in front of the others.
<b> 
</b>tHe makes a reassuring sign to the colonel. Then, he takes the Algerian
 tby the arms, and they move off.
<b> 
</b>
<b>2tSTREETS OF ALGIERS. OUTSIDE. DAWN. OCTOBER 7, 1957. 
</b>
tThe city is gray and white, by the sea which looks like milk. The dawn
toutlines her features sharply.
<b> 
</b>tThe streets and wide avenues of the European quarters are empty.
tSilence, until gradually is heard ...
<b> 
</b><b>tA HUMMING OF MOTORS.
</b><b> 
</b>tOne truck after another. Their headlights on, with an opaque glow, by 
tnow useless.
<b> 
</b>tA line of trucks follow one another along the sea-front, all at the 
tsame speed.
<b> 
</b>tThey turn right and go up toward Place du Gouvernement. 

tHere, without stopping, the columns divide in two. The two lines enter 
teach of the two roads that lead up to surround the Casbah.

tIn the brighter light, the Casbah appears completely white, limestone. 
tEnclosed by the European city, it stands at a greater height and 
toverlooks it.
<b> 
</b>tMosaic of terraces. White pavement, pavement interspersed by the black 
toutlays of narrow alleys. Only a jump from one terrace to another ...

tAgile and silent, the paras jump one by one from the trucks in a hurry.
<b> 
</b><b>tSOUND OF TRUCKS.
</b><b> 
</b>tThey arrange themselves geometrically, their movements synchronized. 
tThey disperse and disappear in the alleys. 

tThey reappear together, then once again scatter. 

tThey meet without looking at one another; each one takes his own 
tcourse.
<b> 
</b>tIn like manner without a sound, they are above, even on the terraces, 
tin perfect geometry. Even up here, the paras tighten their grip ...
<b> 
</b>
<b>3tRUE DES ABDERAMES. COURTYARD OF HOUSE. INSIDE/OUTSIDE. DAWN.
</b><b> 
</b>tEvery three yards, there is a para, even at all four corners of an 
tintersection.

tThey are also in the side streets as well as the main streets. 

tAnd also above, against the sky, many other paras appear. 

tNumber three. The doorway is the height of a man. A squadron stands 
tready in a semicircle with machine guns in firing position.

tMarc continues to hold up the Algerian by his arm. 

tThe captain glances at his watch, then looks up at the terrace and 
tgives a signal.
<b> 
</b>tIn a lowered voice, without turning around, he speaks to the para who 
tis at his back:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttFire ...
<b> 
</b>tThe para nears the front door, his legs wide open, his machine gun, 
tclenched at his side, and aims at the lock.
<b> 
</b><b> tMACHINE GUN FIRE.
</b><b> 
</b>tHe moves the gun barrel in a circular direction. 

tImmediately the others hurl themselves against the door. 

tAt the same time, the door of the terrace is broken down, and the paras 
tburst into the house below.

tThe inner courtyard is square. In the center there is a well; above, a 
tpatch of sky; on four sides, the arcades, columns, and majolica arches. 
tBeneath the porches, there is a door for every dwelling. And above, a 
tbalcony with railings and other doors. The doors are wide open. The 
tparas quickly carry out their orders.

<b>tORDERS, CURT AND BRIEF.
</b>
tThe people are used to all this and know how to obey. The scene takes 
tplace exactly as if it were an arranged maneuver, a practice drill.
<b> 
</b>tThe rooms are emptied in a few seconds. The people are crowded together 
tin the courtyard. 

tEyes wide with fright.
<b> 
</b>tMen, women, and children with blankets and sheets thrown around their 
tshoulders. By now, it is almost day. A soft light is diffused from 
tabove.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian walks with his head lowered, Marc on one side, the captain
 ton, the other.
<b> 
</b>tThey climb to the first floor and go along the balcony. 

tThe Algerian stops in front of a door. 

tThe captain murmurs softly:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttHere?
<b> 
</b> tThe Algerian nods yes. They enter.
<b> 
</b>
<b>4tALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN. 
</b>
tThe room is badly lit. There is a mattress on the floor, and another on 
tthe table, a cupboard against the wall, some chairs. Nothing else. At 
tthe back of the room to the left, there is a dividing curtain hung by a 
tcord at medium height. The curtain is drawn and a large bed with brass 
theadboards is visible. The Algerian points in that direction; the 
tcaptain signals for him to go there.

tThey go forward silently, and push aside the curtain. There is a small 
tlight bulb hung on the wall beneath a small shelf covered with 
tpostcards and photos.
<b> 
</b>tThe baseboard all around is more than three feet tall and is covered by 
tmajolica tiles.

tThe Algerian points to a spot in the brick structure, on the back 
twall, between the headboard of the bed and a corner of the room.

tMarc and the captain have their machine guns ready. The captain goes 
tnear the wall, his breath drawn, and begins to examine it.
<b> 
</b>tHe runs the fingernail of his thumb along the wall horizontally, 
tbetween one row of tiles and another.

tHe taps the tiles at different places until he hears the plaster in the 
tinterstices crumble. He looks at the bit of plaster that is left in his 
tnail.
<b> 
</b>tHe squeezes it in his fingertips; it is soft, newly laid.

tThen he bends over, places his ear to the wall, and listens. 

tSuddenly he smiles.
<b> 
</b>
<b>5tALI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE.
</b><b> 
</b> tThere isn't enough air in the hiding place. The four are forced to 
tbreathe deeply. And in that small space their laborious breaths 
tresound like splashes.
<b> 
</b>tAli la Pointe has his eyes fixed upon the square patch of wall that 
tseals the hiding place. His eyes are large, black, slanted, his eyelids 
theavy, somewhat lowered, so that the black of the irises appears even 
tblacker in the shadows, deeper and more sullen.

tPetit Omar is with him, a boy of twelve, and Mahmoud who is eighteen. 
tThere is also Hassiba, a Kabyle girl, blond, blue-eyed, and fair 
tskinned.

tThe hiding place is only five feet high, and hardly holds them. They 
tare sitting or stretched out on the ground, close to one another.

tThe entrance to the hiding place is blocked by the small patch of wall 
twhich matches exactly the rest. It is held firm by a bar through an 
tiron ring attached at the center. On the other side of the cell, above 
tthem, there is a hole for air. 

tThey are tense and do not move. Their lips are dry, half-open, and 
ttheir breasts rise and fall in a difficult attempt to breathe.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttt(off)
ttAli la Pointe ... the house is surrounded. 
ttYou haven't got a chance. Surrender. Let 
ttthe child and the girl come out, then you 
ttand the other one. Leave your weapons 
ttinside. It's useless to try anything. Our 
ttmachine guns are ready to fire -- you 
ttwouldn't have time. Do you understand?
<b> 
</b>tAli's face is motionless and hasn't changed its expression.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttt(off)
ttAli, do you hear me? Listen! You are the 
ttlast one. The organization is finished. 
ttAll your friends are dead or in prison. 
ttCome out. You'll have a fair trial. Come 
ttout, surrender.
<b> 
</b><b>tSOUND OF FOOTSTEPS, OTHER VOICES, CHEERFUL, INCOHERENT: 
</b>
<b>ttttVOICES PARAS
</b>ttWhy are they breathing so heavily? 
ttFear ...
ttAir ... 
ttThey haven't got enough air inside ...

tAnd again the voice of the captain, clear and somewhat distant:

<b>ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttt(off)
ttMake up your mind, Ali? Do you want us to 
ttwall you in, or do you prefer that we 
ttblow you to pieces? ... Alright. So much 
ttthe worse for you.

tAli's expression is still firm; his stare is dark and sullen.

</b>
<b>6tVIEWS OF THE CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY. NOVEMBER 1, 1954. 
</b>
tThe Casbah: compressed humanity, swarming in the alleyways, on the 
tsteps, in the cafes, in the Arab baths, in the mosques, and in the 
tmarkets; a tangle of voices, gestures, faces, veiled women, eyes. 
tSomeone is putting up a handbill, another distributes them.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSPEAKER
</b>tt"National Liberation Front! Algerian 
ttbrothers! The time has come to break 
ttloose at long last from the bonds of 
ttmisery in which one hundred and thirty 
ttyears of colonial oppression has kept us 
ttchained. The moment of struggle is near; 
ttour goal -- national independence ..."
<b> 
</b>
<b>7tVIEWS OF THE EUROPEAN CITY. OUTSIDE. DAY. 
</b>
tThe European city: reinforced concrete, asphalt, steel, lights, shop 
twindows, buildings, automobiles. A steady rhythm of efficiency, music, 
tcordiality, an apxe9ritif.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSPEAKER
</b>tt"In order to avoid a fatal and bloody 
ttconflict, we propose an honorable program 
ttof discussion to the French authorities, 
tton condition that they recognize the right 
ttof our people to self-government ..."

tAnd the Algerians who work in the European city, the dockers, waiters, 
tlaborers, street-cleaners, farm-hands, and gardeners.

<b>ttttSPEAKER
</b>tt"Algerians unite! Be ready for action! 
ttThe National Liberation Front calls you to 
ttstruggle." 

tUnemployed, peddlers, beggars, shoeshine boys ...
<b> 
</b>
<b>8tSTREET CARD GAME. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b> tTwo hands are moving; one over the other, they criss-cross with 
tincredible speed; at the same time, they are shifting three small 
tpieces of wood which appear to be identical. The hand movements are 
tmarked by a kind of Algerian CHANT.

tFrom time to time, the pieces of wood are overturned for a split second 
tso that the other sides are visible. Robust hands, thick, unusually 
tagile for their size. The hands of Ali la Pointe, younger then, twenty-
tfour years old.
<b> 
</b>tA European quarter of Algiers. Coming and going of people, automobile 
ttraffic. On the sidewalk a small group of European and two Algerian 
tboys.
<b> 
</b>tOther passersby stop to watch. The group crowds around the stand where 
tAli la Pointe is playing his game.

tThe entranced eyes of all present are staring at the pieces of wood.

tAli's hands seem to move by themselves.
<b> 
</b>tHis glance, always a bit sullen, apparently distracted, indifferent, 
tpasses from one face to another, and then to the street, from one side 
tto another.
<b> 
</b>tAt fifty yards, a policeman. Two Europeans, a man and a woman, are 
tspeaking to him in an excited manner, and nudging him along pointing to 
tAli.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWOMAN
</b>ttLook! Yes, that's him!
<b>  
</b> tAli is no longer singing. His hands have stopped moving. 

<b>tA POLICE SIREN IS HEARD.
</b>
tAli pushes his way through the crowd. 

tHe breaks into a run.
<b> 
</b>tThe policeman also begins to run.
<b> 
</b>
<b>9tSTREET. ALI'S FLIGHT. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe street is sloping. Ali flees, pursued by the policeman. He dodges 
tpassersby with agility. He gains ground. But nearby are heard ... 

<b>tSIRENS 
</b>
tand also in front of him.

tAnother two policemen; they too are running. 

tThere is an intersection. At the corner, a cafe. 

<b>tGAY MUSIC.
</b>
tYoung Europeans leaning against a shop window stop chattering and look.

tAli reaches the corner, crosses the street, passes by the bar. 

tThere is a blond youth, about eighteen, who seems to be a student who 
tstretches out his foot, and pushes a chair in front of him.

tAli stumbles and falls.
<b> 
</b>tThe youth attempts a laugh, and at the same time moves backward.

tAli is lying face downward, but suddenly turns his head toward the 
tyouth and stares at him. Then lifting himself by his arms, he turns to 
tlook back. 

tThe police are now twenty yards away.

tAli gets to his feet. For a split second, he hesitates. He hurls 
thimself against the youth, headfirst.

tUsing his head, Ali rams into the youth's face, striking him in the 
tnose and splurting blood everywhere.
<b> 
</b>tThe youth is unable to shout. He opens his mouth in the attempt, but 
tthe only result is a gurgling sound and blood. His friends intervene. 
tAli is surrounded. The police arrive. A mass of people jump on Ali, 
tkicking him and striking him with their fists as long as they please. 
tFinally the police aid Ali and disperse the crowd.

tAli is now in handcuffs and being led away.

tMore people have arrived. They are yelling, shouting insults, and 
tspitting on Ali.
<b> 
</b>tAli passes in their midst protected by the police. He pays no heed to 
tthe fist blows, the shouts, the spits, but seems neither to see nor 
thear, as if he were already resigned to having lost the battle this 
ttime, and were preparing to wait patiently for a better chance.

tHe is walking with an unfaltering step. His face is emotionless, oval, 
tswarthy. His hair black and wavy, his forehead low and wide; his eyes 
tlarge and slanted with eyelids somewhat lowered, his mouth firm and 
tproud.

<b>ttttSPEAKER
</b>ttOmar Ali, known as "Ali la Pointe" born 
ttin Miliana, March 1, 1930. Education: 
ttIlliterate. Occupation: Manual laborer,

<b> 
</b>
<b>10tPARIS 1955. OUTSIDE. DAY. 
</b>
tThe air is clear and springlike. A 4CV Citroen delivery van is parked 
tin front of the Minister of the Interior warehouses. The rear door is 
topen, the motor is running, a policeman is at the wheel. Two workers in 
toveralls exit from the warehouses.

tEach one is carrying a box, and places it inside the van. The boxes are 
tmade of seasoned wood, both of them rectangular. They are each about 
teight inches long; one and two yards high respectively. The two workers 
tsit down inside the van, toward the rear. They are facing toward the 
texterior. Their feet are dangling and almost touch the ground.

tThe jolting movement of the van in motion causes them to laugh.

tSTREETS OF PARIS. Spring. Girls with lightweight clinging dresses. The 
ttwo workers call them, whistle, gesture, and then move off in the 
tdistance.
<b> 
</b>tORLY AIRPORT. The van stops in front of a warehouse. The two workers 
tjump to the ground, place the boxes on their shoulders, and enter the 
twarehouse.
<b> 
</b>tThe boxes are moving on a mobile ramp. There is a large label on each 
tone which says: REPUBLIC OF FRANCE. MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR. 
<b>tDESTINATION: BARBEROUSSE PRISON. ALGIERS.
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>11tALGIERS. BARBEROUSSE PRISON. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
</b><b> 
</b>tBarberousse prison is situated on the outskirts of the Upper Casbah. It 
tis an ancient fortress with thick, high surrounding walls, which appear 
tto vanish in contrast with the central building which dominates them. 
tThe whole structure is covered with limestone like the other houses of 
tthe Casbah. Only the bars on the windows and the big gate are black. 

tThe gate opens. A covered jeep enters the prison courtyard. In the 
tstronghold of the jeep are the two boxes sent from Paris. 

tEarly morning. The sky is pale blue. In the prison courtyard, the 
tworkers open the two chests and assemble the guillotine. It is possible 
tto see it from the cell windows that face the courtyard. Faces of 
tprisoners appear between the bars of some windows.
<b> 
</b>tThe workers have disappeared. Only the delicate, makeshift structure of 
tthe guillotine is visible, its slender outline lengthened.
<b> 
</b>
<b>12tPRISON CELL. INSIDE. MORNING.
</b><b> 
</b>tIn one of the cells there are about twenty prisoners. The cell is huge; 
tthere are two very high windows that almost reach the ceiling.
<b> 
</b>tA prisoner is standing on the urine bucket, and looks outside through 
tthe barred window. On the ground there are some mats which serve as 
tbeds. Nothing else.
<b> 
</b>tAbout ten prisoners are in a group, seated on the ground, and they are 
tspeaking in whispers. 

<b>tAD LIB DIALOGUE IN LOWERED VOICES.
</b><b> 
</b>tTwo of them are playing with some stones on a chessboard drawn in the 
tdirt; others are speaking among themselves. One is reading a Mickey 
tMouse comic book and laughing to himself. But all of them, in 
tappearance and behavior, are distinguished from those who make up the 
tmore numerous group. These solitary men are different in some way, they 
tare not ordinary delinquents.

tAli la Pointe is alone, withdrawn from the others, seated on the 
tground, his shoulders propped against the wall, his knees raised. He is 
tbarefoot. On his left ankle, directly above his foot, are tattooed two 
twords in print: TAIS-TOI. His shirt is unbuttoned and on his chest are 
tother tattoos in a strange design.

tAli looks at the group and seems to listen to their murmured words 
tabsent-mindedly. His expression is taciturn, reserved, and indifferent.

tAli turns to the prisoner at the window.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPRISONER AT WINDOW
</b>ttLook at them!

tAli jumps to his feet. Everyone moves toward the two windows.
<b> 
</b> tAli moves away two yards at a quick pace, then runs toward the window, 
tand grabbing hold of the bars, heaves himself up to it.

tThe condemned man turns and looks up toward the windows. He seems to 
tsmile although his face is motionless. In a soft voice, he speaks to 
tthose faces which appear behind the bars: 

<b>ttttCONDEMNED MAN
</b>ttTahia el Djez-air! [Long live Algeria!]

tThe political prisoners take up the phrase and recite it gutturally, 
tkeeping time to the steps of the condemned man. 

<b>ttttPOLITICAL PRISONERS
</b>ttTahia el Djez-air!
<b> 
</b>
<b>13 tPRISON COURTYARD. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe condemned man walks toward the guillotine accompanied by guards and 
ta priest reading the Koran. There is also the executioner wearing a 
tblack hood. The executioner tries to appear indifferent. The priest 
trecites his prayers. The entire ceremony seems improvised and hasty. 
tThe epilogue is reached quickly. 

<b>tPRAYERS.
</b>
tThe condemned man bends. The executioner places his neck in the right 
tposition, adjusts it, turns his head a bit, then pushes his body 
tforward. He releases the mechanism.
<b> 
</b>tThe blade falls, the head rolls. There is no longer a chorus. No one is 
tchanting.
<b> 
</b>tAli's eyes have remained motionless.
<b> 
</b>tThen from above, as the dismembered body is being carried away in a 
tbasket, as the priest, the guards, and the officer are leaving, as the 
tworkers dismantle the guillotine, from above, from the balconies of the 
tCasbah, suddenly the "ju-jus" of the women are heard, dense like the 
tcries of birds, shrill, metallic, angry.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttWOMEN
</b>ttJu-ju ... 
<b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>14tSMALL SQUARE. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY. JANUARY 1956. 
</b>
tIt is raining. The water runs along the gulleys of the narrow alleys. 
tThe white houses have turned spongy gray. The children of the Casbah 
tare playing and spattering mud. Skinny and half-naked children with 
tbloated bellies and hair cropped because of sores.

tTheir mothers call them in vain. They continue to run, play, and wallow 
tin the mud with a despairing gaiety. 

<b>tCALLS. VOICES. SHOUTS.
</b><b> 
</b>tPetit Omar was then ten years old. He is slender, dressed in long pants 
tand a jacket which is too large for him and torn so that he seems 
talmost clownish. Calm and absorbed, he passes in the midst of the other 
tchildren, but doesn't notice them or their games.
<b> 
</b>tA small square on a sloping ascent.

tIn the center, a fountain. On the elevated side of the square, on a 
tcorner, there is a mosque. 

<b>tSOUNDS OF CHURCH MUSIC.
</b>
tStanding still at the foot of the steps is an Algerian in white cloak, 
tand hood down to his eyes. Other people pass by. The Algerian is turned 
tto one side so as not to be seen. Petit Omar walks toward him and nears 
this back. The Algerian turns; it is Ali la Pointe. He tells the boy 
twith a tone of boredom and curtness:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttGo away!
<b> 
</b><b> ttttPETIT OMAR 
</b>ttMen have two faces: one that laughs and 
ttone that cries ...
<b> 
</b>tAli looks at him incredulously and asks:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttAnd they sent you!
<b> 
</b>tThe child slips a hand under his sweater to his chest.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPETIT OMAR 
</b>ttSure, something wrong with that?
<b> 
</b>tOmar takes out a piece of paper folded in four, and hands it to Ali.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPETIT OMAR

</b>ttSure ...

tAli hands back the paper.

<b> 
</b>tAli turns and looks around him. He squats on his heels in order to 
treach Omar's height.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttALI 
</b>ttHere.
<b> 
</b> tIt is still drizzling. Omar unfolds the paper and begins to read it.

<b>15 tRUE RANDOM. CAFE MEDJEBRI. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe following day at 5 p.m., rue Random. The street is fairly wide for 
ta street in the Arab quarter and at this hour it is crowded with 
tpeople. There are Algerians in traditional costumes and others in 
tEuropean clothes. Noisy and tumultuous background ...
<b> 
</b><b>tVOICES, SOUNDS, WORDS -- ALL MIXED TOGETHER. 
</b>
tVeiled women with intent glances. Silent women who seem to float 
tthrough the crowds, untouchable.

tAn Arab cafe filled with customers at the tables and bar. Through the 
tlarge shop window, a smoky, steamy interior is visible. The cafe is 
tlocated in rue Random, number 40.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttOMAR 
</b>ttt(off)
ttThere is an Arab cafe at rue Random 40. 
ttThe owner's name is Medjebri. He is a 
ttpolice informer ...
<b> 
</b> tMedjebri is standing behind the cash register, smiling, very busy. He 
tis wearing a traditional costume. He is very clearly visible through 
tthe shop window above the heads of the customers.
<b> 
</b>tIn a doorway near the cafe there is a clock hanging from a signboard in 
tfront of a store. It is five o'clock. A French policeman enters the 
tcafe.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttOMAR 
</b>ttt(off) 
ttEvery day at 5 p.m., a French policeman 
ttgoes to see him. He stops for a few 
ttminutes to get information with the 
ttexcuse of drinking a cup of tea. You have 
ttto kill the policeman ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttt(off) 
ttNot Medjebri?
<b> 
</b> tMedjebri moves away from the register, still standing behind the bar, 
tto where the policeman is seated. He greets him, and hands him a cup of 
ttea.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttOMAR 
</b>ttt(off)
ttNo. It says the policeman.
<b> 
</b> tThe policeman is leaning on the bar. He is tall and husky, and is 
twearing a scruffy uniform with a kepi pushed back somewhat. Now his 
tthick lips are sipping the scalding mint tea.

<b>ttttALI
</b>ttt(off)
ttOkay ...
<b> 
</b>tThe large clock and store signboard. Standing in front, there is a 
tslender girl, veiled, her eyes darting in contrast with the rigid form 
tof her motionless body. Her arms are raised to form an arch, her hands 
tsupporting the edges of a large basket balanced on her head.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttOMAR 
</b>ttt(off) 
ttAt the corner, right in front of the 
ttlarge clock, there will be a girl 
ttcarrying a basket. When the policeman 
ttcomes out, you will follow him together. 
ttAt the right moment she will give you a 
ttpistol. You have only to shoot ... 
ttquickly and in the back. 

tNow the policeman has finished drinking his tea. He makes a sign to 
tpay. Smiling, Medjebri refuses the money, and says good-bye.

tAli approaches the girl. They exchange glances. The girl puts down her 
tbasket which is filled with corn, and rests it by her side.

tShe moves slowly toward the cafe. Ali walks beside her.
<b> 
</b>tThe policeman is coming out of the cafe. He rudely bumps into those who 
tare entering.
<b> 
</b>tHe makes his way along the sidewalk, and moves further away, balancing 
this heavy body at every step.
<b> 
</b>tAli and the girl are about a yard away from him. They follow him, 
tpushed along with the many others who are crowded on the sidewalk.

tThen the girl plunges her hand into the corn. In a second, she places 
tthe revolver in Ali's right hand.

tHe holds it under his cloak. The policeman's back is a hand's-bredth 
taway. But Ali does not shoot. 

tHe moves forward to pass by the policeman.
<b> 
</b>tAlarmed, the girl looks at him, and tries to hold him back. She shakes 
ther head as if to speak. 

tAli smiles at her. His eyes have a hard glint.

tHe moves a few steps past the policeman. Suddenly Ali turns, lifts his 
tarm as if to push his way through, and then stretches out his hand with 
tthe revolver aimed.
<b> 
</b>tThe policeman stops; his eyes are wide with fear. Instinctively he 
tlifts his arms and opens his palms. 

tTerror paralyzes him.
<b> 
</b>tAli glances about him. Many people are moving away hastily, but others 
tstand still in a circle and watch fascinated. Ali speaks to all of 
tthem, in a loud voice. His eyes are alight.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttALI 
</b>ttDon't move! Look at him. You're not 
ttgiving any orders now! Your hands are up, 
tteh! Do you see him, brothers? Our masters 
ttaren't very special, are they?
<b> 
</b>tA sharp, metallic click. Ali tries a second time, presses the trigger 
tagain.
<b> 
</b><b>tSEVERAL CLICKS. REVOLVER EMPTY. 
</b>
tAli rolls the gun barrel; it is empty.

tThe policeman slowly lowers his hands. His right hand rushes to his 
tholster.
<b> 
</b>tAli is ready to jump, throws away the gun, and starts to move forward.

tHe knocks down the policeman, who is overwhelmed, and falls backward.
<b> 
</b>tThe crowd moves away quickly. Ali starts to throw himself on the 
tFrenchman lying on the ground, but stops halfway. 

tA thought restrains him. He turns and sees the girl who has picked up 
tthe revolver and hidden it again in her basket. 

tThen she moves away hurriedly.
<b> 
</b>tAli curses angrily, then, kicks the policeman's head twice, and runs 
tafter the girl.

tHe reaches her, grabs her shoulder so roughly that she shouts.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttt(in a whisper) 
ttBastard! ... Bitch!
<b> 
</b>tThe girl struggles free from his grip. At the same time, they hear 
tbehind them ...
<b> 
</b><b> tPOLICE WHISTLES.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe girl quickens her step.
<b> 
</b>
<b>16 tSIDE ALLEY WITH FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. SUNSET. 
</b>
tThe girl arrives at a side street, enters it, and breaks into a run.

tAli is again beside her, but unexpectedly the girl enters a front door.

tShe bends, places the basket on the ground, removes the revolver, and 
thides it in her breast beneath her shawl. She gets up again, and leaves 
tthe basket. Ali blocks her way.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttTell me what this joke is all about.
<b>      
</b>tThe girl attempts to push past him toward the door.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDJAMILA 
</b>ttLet's move now or they'll catch us.
<b> 
</b>tAli grabs her by the arm, shakes her, and shouts uncontrollably:

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttI want to know who sent me that letter. 
ttWhat's his name? 

<b>ttttDJAMILA 
</b>ttHe's waiting for you! 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttWhere?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDJAMILA 
</b>ttWe're going there ... if you don't get us 
ttarrested first.

tThe girl nods toward the street where two policemen are passing by 
thastily.
<b> 
</b>tAli moves backward into the shadow of the doorway. He regains control 
tof his nerves, loosens his cloak, and lets it fall on the basket. He is 
tdressed in European clothes, trousers and pullover.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttt(pushing her ahead)
ttMove ... go ahead. I'll follow you.
<b> 
</b>tThe girl takes a look outside, then goes out. Ali follows her a few 
tsteps behind. By now it is dusk.

</b>
<b>17tTERRACE. KADER'S HOUSE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
</b><b> 
</b>tIt is a starry night and there are few lights visible in the windows of 
tthe Casbah. In the background, there is the triumphant neon of the 
tEuropean city, the sea, the ships at anchor, the shining beams of a 
tlighthouse. Kader turns around gracefully, and goes to sit on the wall 
tof the terrace. 

<b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttYou could have been a spy. We had to put 
ttyou to the test.
<b> 
</b>tAli looks at him sullenly. 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttWith an unloaded pistol?
<b> 
</b><b> ttttKADER 
</b>ttI'll explain.
<b> 
</b>tKader is a few years older than Ali, but not so tall. He is slender 
twith a slight yet sturdy bone structure. The shape of his face is 
ttriangular, aristocratic, his lips thin, his eyes burning with hatred, 
tbut at the same time, cunning. He continues to speak in a calm tone 
twhich has an ironic touch to it.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttLet's suppose you were a spy. In prison, 
ttwhen the NLF contacts you, you pretend to 
ttsupport the revolution, and then the 
ttFrench help you to escape ...

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttSure. By shooting at me.

<b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttEven that could be a trick. You escape, 
ttthen show up at the address which the 
ttbrothers in prison gave to you, and so 
ttyou are able to contact me ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI
</b>ttI don't even know your name yet ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttMy name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... 
ttIn other words, in order to join the 
ttorganization, you had to undergo a test. 
ttI could have told you to murder the 
ttbarman, but he's an Algerian ... and the 
ttpolice would let you kill him, even 
ttthough he is one of theirs. By obeying 
ttsuch an order, you still could have 
ttbeen a double agent. And that's why I 
tttold you to kill the French policeman: 
ttbecause the French wouldn't have let 
ttyou do it. If you were with the police 
ttyou wouldn't have done it.
<b> 
</b>tAli has followed Kader's logic a bit laboriously, and he is fascinated 
tby it. But not everything is clear yet. 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttBut I haven't shot him.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttKADER 
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttYou weren't able to. But what's important 
ttis that you tried.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttWhat's important for me is that you let me 
ttrisk my life for nothing.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttKADER 
</b>ttC'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders 
ttwere to shoot him in the back.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttI don't do that kind of thing. 

<b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttThen don't complain.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttYou still haven't told me why you didn't 
ttlet me kill him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttBecause we aren't ready yet for the 
ttFrench. Before attacking, we must have 
ttsafe places from which to depart and find 
ttrefuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. 
ttBut even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There 
ttare too many drunks, pushers, whores, 
ttaddicts, spies ... people who talk too 
ttmuch ... people who are ready to sell 
ttthemselves, undecided people. We must 
tteither convince them or eliminate them. 
ttWe must think of ourselves first. We must 
ttclean out the Casbah first. Only then 
ttwill we be able to deal with the French. 
ttDo you understand, Ali? 

tAli doesn't answer.
<b> 
</b>tKader has come down from the wall and looks toward the Casbah. Ali too 
tlooks toward the Casbah, immersed in the night.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttAnd how many are we? 

<b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttNot enough.

<b>18 tAREAS OF CASBAH UNDERWORLD. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. MARCH 1956.

tCasbah, from the Upper to Lower Casbah, the street of the Algerian 
tunderworld descends to the brothel quarter.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSPEAKER
</b>tt"National Liberation Front, bulletin

ttonly for our people's great misery, but

ttdignity ..."
<b> 
</b>tShady bars for gamblers and opium smokers, shops filled with tourist 
ttrinkets, merchants, fences, pimps, children with adult faces, ghastly 
told women, and young girls, whores standing in the doorways of their 
thouses.  The girls having their faces uncovered have put scarves on 
ttheir heads, knotted at the nape.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttSPEAKER
</b>tt"Corruption and brutality have always

</b>
<b>19tBAR. EUROPEAN CITY FACING CASBAH. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. SUNSET.
</b><b> 
</b>tIt is dusk. In the European city, the first lights are visible. People 
tbegin to crowd the bars for an apxe9ritif.

tAn Algerian shoeshine man leaves his workbox at the entrance of the 
tbar. He goes to the counter. He is tall and thin as a reed. He takes 
tfrom his pocket a handful of change; his hands tremble slightly as he 
tcounts it.
<b> 
</b>tThe barman recognizes him, fills a glass of wine, and places it in 
tfront of him. The Algerian pays and takes the glass. It's probably not 
this first; the trembling of his hands increases. The Algerian drinks 
tthe wine in one gulp, then goes to the door. He waits patiently while 
tsome Europeans enter. He goes out, picks up his workbox, and moves 
taway.
<b> 
</b>
<b>20 tRUE MARENGO AND STEPS. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe Algerian is standing at the top of some steep, almost vertical 
tsteps that lead from the European quarters to the Casbah.

tNow he is in rue Marengo. There is still some daylight. The street is 
tcrowded. The Algerian is unsteady on his legs. He stops and mutters 
tsomething to himself. It is obvious that he is trying to hide his 
tdrunkenness.
<b> 
</b>tHe begins to walk, his hand against the wall for support. He stumbles.
<b> 
</b>tThe workbox falls, scattering brushes and cans of shoe polish on the 
tground. The Algerian bends down, and begins to pick up his tools. He is 
tswearing.
<b> 
</b>tOthers have seen him. A peddler points him out to a child of about ten. 
tIt is Petit Omar, who nods yes, then whistles. 

tAnother whistle answers him, then another and another. 

tThere are other children, at every corner of the street. 

tThey arrive in a run and gather together.

tOmar points to the drunk who is now moving away, and gives the order to 
tattack. It is evident that this is not a game for them, but a duty.

tThere is a chorus of brief shouting, of insults, and whistles. 

tThe drunk sees them approaching. He is terrified. 

tHe tries to quicken his step.
<b> 
</b>tThey reach him quickly and surround him. They attack him and then flee, 
tsmall yet elusive. They do not laugh even once; their faces are hard 
tand cruel.
<b> 
</b>tThe drunk swings around holding his workbox by its strap. 

tSome children are hit; some fall.
<b> 
</b>tThe drunk avails himself of this chance to escape, and retraces his 
tsteps to the staircase.
<b> 
</b>tHe begins to descend toward the European quarters. But the children are 
tagain upon him.
<b> 
</b>tThey are shouting more loudly now, and pushing him. He quickens his 
tstep, and staggering jumps the steps two by two. 

tThe children trip him and he falls.
<b> 
</b>tHe is crying. He shields himself with his hands. 

tThe workbox has fallen and is rolling down the steps. The children are 
tnow on top of him, like small beasts on a carrion. They smother him, 
tpush him and pull him. They are no longer shouting.

tAll of them are intent upon their efforts. Only the drunk is shouting 
tdespairingly.
<b> 
</b>tThey succeed in moving him, and hurl him down the steps. He rolls 
tdownward, trying in vain to grab something with his hands.
<b> 
</b>
<b>21tBAR CASBAH. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tOutside the sun's light is blinding. Inside the small bar there is 
tfresh air and shade.
<b> 
</b>tA young Algerian, with lifeless eyes and an idle expression, is rolling 
tan opium cigarette. He lights it. Two slaps cause the cigarette to fall 
tfrom his lips.

tAli la Pointe is wearing a djellabah, a type of cloak without buttoning 
twhich slips on over the head. There is an opening of about eight inches
 tat the waist.
<b> 
</b>tAli has stretched his arm through the opening to slap the opium addict, 
twho recognizes Ali, smiles, and makes a dazed grimace.

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttWake up! Have you seen Hacene le Bonois?

</b><b>ttttOPIUM-ADDICT

ttNot today ...
<b> 
</b>tThen he gets up laboriously, bends down, and looks for the cigarette 
tthat had fallen from his hand.

tHe doesn't reach it. Ali quickly crushes the cigarette with his foot. 
tHe is wearing a pair of sneakers. He moves away and leaves the bar.
<b> 
</b>

<b>23 tBROTHEL QUARTERS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b><b> tOFF LIMITS 
</b>tEntrance to the brothel quarters. The street widens, the alleys branch 
toff and seem to broaden. There are one or two Europeans, not only 
ttourists in search of adventure, but also elements of the international 
tcriminal underworld who mingle here with the Algerians.

tAlmost all the buildings house a brothel or other place of ill-repute. 
tOn some doorways signs are hanging which read: 

<b>tttTHIS IS AN HONEST HOUSE.
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>24tBROTHEL. INSIDE. DAY. 
</b>
tAli has entered a brothel. It is morning and there are few clients. The 
twhores are Algerian and European. Some of them are pretty.

tThe madam is an Algerian, dressed in European clothes. She is about 
tforty, heavily made up. When she spots Ali, she interrupts her usual 
tprofessional chant. She seems curious, yet glad.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMADAM 
</b>ttt(shouting) 
ttAli la Pointe!
<b> 
</b> tShe stops herself, already sorry for having spoken so quickly and 
timprudently. Ali doesn't answer her, but approaches with a steady and 
tserious glance.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMADAM 
</b>ttt(changing tone)
ttHaven't seen you around for some time. I

</b>tAli leans against the counter, never once taking his eyes off her.

</b>ttt(in sharp voice)
ttDon't move! 

tThen he glances at the others. 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttHands still.
<b> 
</b>tThe others are three young Algerians, Hacene's bodyguards. Hacene le 
tBonois is tall with short legs out of proportion with his enormous 
tchest. He is somewhat corpulent. He has a wide face, a cheerful and 
tself-confident expression. His clothing is a strange combination of 
tAlgerian and European which does not, however, appear ridiculous, but 
timposing. At Ali's remark, his expression changes, becomes amazed and 
tbaffled. But at the same time, his eyes give away the brain's attempt 
tto find an explanation and a solution.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttHACENE 
</b>ttt(astonished)
ttYou know I never carry weapons ...

tAli keeps his arms and hands hidden under his djellabah.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI

tthick and rough.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttHACENE 
</b>ttYou afraid of these ...?

</b>ttDon't move, Hacene.

<b>ttttHACENE 
</b>ttWhy are you afraid? We've always been

</b>ttIt's true.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttHACENE 
</b>ttWhat's happened to you? 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttThe NLF has condemned you to death.

tHacene is stunned. He speaks aloud his thoughts in a soft voice.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHACENE 
</b>ttAh, so its come to this ...
<b> 
</b>tThen he bursts into loud laughter, and seems to turn to the three 
tguards at his back.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHACENE 
</b>ttI'm dying of laughter! Ha ... ha ...

<b> 
</b> tAli doesn't speak. He continues to stare at Hacene. Hacene suddenly 
tstops laughing. His tone of voice changes, becomes brusque and hurried.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHACENE 
</b>ttHow much are they paying you?

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttThey're not paying me anything. They've 
ttalready warned you twice; this is the

<b>ttttHACENE 
</b>ttWhat ... What must I decide?

</b>ttYou've got to change occupations, Hacene.

tHacene makes a gesture as if to emphasize what he is going to say.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHACENE 
</b>ttt(with irony) 
ttOkay, you convince me.
<b> 
</b> tThen suddenly, unexpectedly, he lets out a SHRILL SCREAM, like fencers 
twho before plunging their swords, try to frighten their adversaries.
<b> 
</b>tSimultaneously, he hurls himself forward, head lowered and arms 
toutstretched.

tAli steps aside, and releases a BLAST OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

tHacene falls flat on his face. There is movement. Some passersby 
tapproach. The three boys try to escape.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttt(shouting)
ttStop!
<b> 
</b>tThe barrel of the machine gun is visible through the opening in his

</b>ttLook at him well! Now nobody can do 
ttwhatever he wants in the Casbah. Not even

<b>26tWEDDING. OUTSIDE. DAY.

<b> 
</b>
<b>27tWEDDING HOUSE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b> tIn the inner courtyard, there are benches and chairs arranged in rows. 
tIn front of all of them, there are two chairs separated from the rest, 
tone next to the other. In front of them, there is a small table with a 
tpen and inkstand on top. The people remain standing, about twenty 
tAlgerians, of all ages. They are speaking among themselves in thick 
twhispers. There is an expectant and ceremonious atmosphere. 

<b>tBUZZING.
</b>
tMahmoud was seventeen then. He has soft down on his cheeks, his first 
tbeard. He is thin, his neck long and tense, his glance nervous. He 
tappears to be the protagonist of what is about to take place. His hair 
tis combed with care and covered with much hair cream. He is wearing a 
tclean and newly bought white costume.

tMany of the others come to speak with him; the younger ones are joking 
tand trying to provoke him. 

<b>tAD LIB REMARKS.
</b><b> 
</b>tMahmoud reacts comically with a grim frown with which he tries in vain 
tto hide his shyness. At the same time, he glances secretly, anxiously, 
tup to the empty balcony on the first floor. Much gay and lively 
tchattering can be heard from an open door above.
<b> 
</b>
<b>28tWEDDING ROOM. INSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b> tIn the room, a group of girls are busy preparing trays with cups of 
tcoffee. They are little more than children, twelve or thirteen years 
told, with soft complexions, white teeth, and shining eyes. They seem
tchildren who are playing, but beneath that veneer of gaiety, some 
tanxiety is noticeable, emotions in suspense. The faltering voice of an 
told woman calls from the adjoining room.

tA girl leaves the group, lifts the dividing curtain, and nearing the 
tbed where the old woman is lying, she kneels beside her. The old woman 
tlifts her hand and places it on the girl's hair, caressing her 
ttenderly. She speaks in a wavering voice, and her small yet kind eyes 
tfill with tears. 

<b>tOLD WOMAN'S SPEECH IN ARABIC.
</b>
tThe girl nods yes, then she gets up and goes to rejoin her companions. 
tPassing before a mirror, she stops a minute to tidy her hair.
<b> 
</b>
<b>29tWEDDING HOUSE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tThey appear on the balcony, then descend to the courtyard. The nervous 
tglance of Mahmoud scans their faces, then rests upon that girl who, 
twith lowered eyelids, also glances quickly at him. Meanwhile the trays 
tare being passed among the guests.

tNow the people turn to face the front door. A young man has entered 
tcarrying a briefcase under his arm. Behind him are two boys who seem to 
tbe his bodyguards, and are the only ones dressed in European clothes. 
tBoth of them have their right hands under their jackets, which are old 
tand torn. They seem to be armed. They close the door, and remain 
tstanding on either side of it.

tThe man with the briefcase walks toward the table. All present look at 
thim respectfully. He smiles, responds to their greetings, shakes hands 
twith all. But he refuses coffee and seems to be in a hurry.

tHe sits down, places his briefcase on the table, opens it, and takes 
tout a large notebook. From the open briefcase, the metallic butt of a 
tsub-machine gun appears.

tOn the cover of the notebook is written: NLF -- ALGERIAN  AUTONOMOUS 
<b>tZONE. CIVIL RECORDS.
</b><b> 
</b>tHe turns the pages of the notebook until he reaches the last written 
tpage. Then he glances up toward the people who, in the meantime, have 
ttaken their seats. He smiles, says a few words, then calls two names.
<b> 
</b>tMahmoud walks forward stiffly, erect, his eyes staring straight ahead 
tof him.
<b> 
</b>tThe girl also walks forward, with a perplexed expression. They sit down 
tnext to each other, but without looking at each other. The ceremony 
tconsists of a few words. Finally the two youths look at each other. 
tMahmoud tries to smile, but he cannot.
<b> 
</b>tThe girl's expression softens somewhat. Her glance is tender; she 
tlowers her face quickly. Meanwhile the others recite the verses of the 
tKoran in low voices. 

<b>tCHORUS.
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>30tRUE D'ISLY. OUTSIDE. DAY. JUNE 20, 1956. 8:05 A.M.
</b><b> 
</b>tThere is a French guard, no more than thirty years old. He has a blond 
tmustache, his beard recently shaved. There are few people in the 
tstreet. The guard walks slowly, glancing in the shop windows from time 
tto time to admire his reflection. He stops, adjusts his cap, and 
tsmiles.
<b> 
</b>tAn Algerian appears beside him; he is also young. The guard pretends to 
tbe interested in the photographic equipment which is on display, then
tmoves on.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian's arm springs forward and returns quickly to its place. He 
tplunges the knife into the guard's neck.
<b> 
</b>tThe guard opens his mouth wide to shout, but he cannot. The blood 
tgurgles in his gashed throat. None of the few passersby has seen what 
thappened. The guard falls flat on his face. Someone sees him and 
tscreams.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian hurls himself on top of the soldier, opens his holster, 
ttakes his pistol, then gets up pulling the gun with him. The gun is 
tfastened by a leather cord. The cord gets tangled in the gashed neck of 
tthe guard.

tThe Algerian pulls in vain. He panics. He looks about him with 
tterrified eyes.
<b> 
</b>tPeople approach hurriedly. They are shouting. The Algerian pulls the 
tcord a second time, desperately.

tHe regains his control, picks up the knife which is lying on the 
tground, and cuts the leather cord, thus freeing the pistol. The others 
thave almost reached him and he is surrounded, but he manages to dodge 
tthem, and escapes.
<b> 
</b>
<b>31tBOULEVARD BRU. OUTSIDE. DAY. 8:40 A.M.
</b><b> 
</b>tA group of zouaves on patrol, three soldiers and an officer. The street 
tis sloping; on the right there is a high fence covered with advertising 
tsigns and cinematographic posters, all of them torn and full of holes; 
tthe emptiness on the other side is visible through the holes.

tThe soldiers are chatting among themselves and looking at the posters.

tA soldier stops because he sees something moving on the other side of 
tthe fence.
<b> 
</b>tHe points to it and shouts, but not in time. 

<b>tMACHINE-GUN FIRE INTERRUPTED BY SINGLE SHOTS. 
</b>
tThe soldier falls, the others remain motionless, unbelieving. They 
tbegin to run and scatter and look for cover. 

tAn Algerian appears on top of the fence. He moves like a cat, and jumps 
tfrom the other side.
<b> 
</b>tHis invisible companions continue to shoot. He is unarmed, and runs to 
tthe dead soldier. He grabs the machine gun and retraces his steps. The 
taction takes place in a second. 

tBy now the soldiers too are shooting, but it is too late.
<b> 
</b>
<b>32tPOLICE STATION. CHEMIN AIN-ZEBOUDJA. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. 9:10 A.M.
</b><b> 
</b>tA police station in the Casbah, a small prefabricated one-story
tbuilding.
<b> 
</b>tAt the main door there is a police guard. A group of five Algerians is 
tapproaching. They are talking among themselves, and gesticulating.

<b>tBUZZING.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe policeman enjoys watching them, then asks what it's about. All five 
tof them answer him at once, trying to outdo one another.

tThe policeman has to shout to make them keep quiet. Then, assuming a 
tvery humble behavior, they enter silently. The oldest among them speaks 
tin a mournful voice. He seems to be crying and asks the sergeant 
tsomething.
<b> 
</b>tThe policeman calls a colleague, and tells him to accompany the 
tAlgerians. Four of them go with the policeman, while another remains in
 tthe waiting room, saying that it is better because he is afraid of 
tlosing his control.
<b> 
</b>tThen he begins to explain the reasons for the quarrel: it concerns a 
twill. The old man is his grandfather, but he has recently remarried. 
tThen from inside is heard ...
<b> 
</b><b>tMACHINE-GUN FIRE.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe policeman reacts quickly and tries to draw his gun. But the 
tAlgerian is faster and fires point-blank.

tThe four reappear. One of them is wounded. All of them are armed with 
trevolvers, and carry at their sides a machine gun and two sub-machine 
tguns that they have taken from the armory. Other cries and shots are 
theard behind them. 

tAll five of them run out in haste.
<b> 
</b>
<b>33tRUE MARENGO. OUTSIDE. DAY. 9:45 A.M.
</b><b> 
</b>tAnother police station. Two policemen are chatting in front of the 
tentrance.
<b> 
</b>tA black Renault is passing by at a walking speed, then slows down 
talmost to the point of halting completely.
<b> 
</b>tThe right door opens and there is a burst of machine-gun fire. One of 
tthe policemen has been, hit, and grabs the other so as not to fall.

tAnother burst of ...
<b> 
</b><b>tMACHINE-GUN FIRE.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe two policemen fall down together. The car motor is accelerated, the 
ttires screech and the Renault shoots forward.
<b> 
</b>tA military jeep arrives from the opposite direction, crashes into the 
tcar and blocks its escape.
<b> 
</b>tAn Algerian flees and is pursued. Another descends from the auto with 
this hands raised. 

tThe soldiers shoot and kill him.


<b>34tAVENUE DU 8 NOVEMBRE. OUTSIDE. DAY. 1:10 P.M.
</b><b> 
</b>tA large garage with workshop and filling station. In front are some 
tautomobiles and a military truck.

tA scooter with two Algerian boys passes by, rumbling noisily along the 
troad. Then at full speed, it makes a sharp turn, retraces its steps and 
tturns again. The boys seem to be showing off for fun.

tMeanwhile, the employees of the garage are leaving their work since it 
tis lunchtime. The attendant at the gasoline pumps is left alone.

tThe scooter stops in front of the high-test gasoline pump. The attendant 
tis a European, an elderly man, who approaches them holding in one hand 
tsome bread he has just unwrapped. He detaches the pump handle of high-
ttest, and asks how many gallons.

tOne of the Algerians points a revolver at the attendant, and tells him 
tto pour out the gasoline on the ground all around. The other, 
tmeanwhile, goes to the other two gasoline pumps, detaches the handles, 
tand fastens them in an open position in order to empty them of
tgasoline. He uses two pieces of iron that he has brought with him to 
tclamp the handles open. He stretches the pump hoses as far as they can 
tgo toward the garage and the parked cars.
<b> 
</b>tThe gasoline flows all over the large square. The two youths are again 
ton the scooter; they tell the European to move away. They have soaked a 
trag in gasoline and they light it. 

tThe gasoline continues to flow from the two open pumps. The European is 
tby now far away, the scooter is already moving away, and at the same 
ttime, the boys hurl the lit rag into the square. It immediately bursts 
tinto flames.

tThe night of the same day, in an office of the police commissioner's 
theadquarters. On the desk, photos of the day's terroristic attempts are 
tpiled in a heap. An employee is in front of his typewriter.

tThe Assistant Commissioner is about forty years old, very robust. His 
tface is somewhat wide, ordinary, and with heavy features. He leafs 
tthrough the photos while speaking on the telephone. It is a very warm 
tnight, and the window of the office is open. From outside is heard 
tthe SOUND OF TRAFFIC.

tevidently to keep it a bit cool. He takes it, fills his glass and

tThen he speaks in a lowered voice, while looking outside, without even 
tgiving any directions to the employee who waits with his hands poised

</b>
<b>38tCASBAH ROAD BLOCKS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe Casbah is being closed off. Every point of entrance, every alley, 
tevery street that joins the Casbah and the European quarters has been 
tblocked off with wooden horses and with barbed wire nine feet high.

tThere are also workers, policemen, and soldiers who are working at the 
tbarricades.
<b> 
</b>tBeyond them, on the other side of the barbed wire, the Algerians seem 
tto be encaged.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttSPEAKER
</b>tt"The Prefecture of Algiers states: In 
ttthe course of these last few days, dozens 
ttof assaults have been committed in this 
ttcity. We have reason to believe that the 
ttassailants originate in the Casbah, and 
ttthat they have always found a speedy and 
tteasy refuge in the alleys of the Arab 
ttquarters. As a result, and in order to
ttalleviate without delay the insecurity 
ttthat now reigns in the city, the 
ttPrefecture of Algiers has decided that 
ttentrance to the Casbah can only he 
ttpermitted at those points in the blockade
ttunder military control, where citizens in 
tttransit must exhibit their documents at 
ttrequest, and submit to eventual searches."
<b> 
</b>tThe Casbah is imprisoned, like a huge concentration camp. Only five 
tstreets have been left open, the widest streets. There are five exits 
twhere the wooden horses serve to restrict passage, and where some 
twooden posts for the guards are being built.

tEvery exit is marked by a sign with large lettering.
<b> 
</b>
<b>39 tBLOCKADE MARENGO. OUTSIDE. DAY. AUGUST 10, 1956.
</b><b> 
</b>tAt each blockade, there are two ramps, an entrance and an exit to the 
tCasbah. The Algerians and some Europeans crowd around in both 
tdirections. The soldiers are wearing fatigues with helmets and machine 
tguns. The Europeans are not requested to show identity papers.

tThe Algerians are often frisked, and accept this fact silently, 
tpatiently, without any sign of intolerance. But if the soldiers attempt 
tto search a woman, then, it is different.
<b> 
</b>tA woman begins to shout, while waving her arms wildly, and pushes away 
tthe soldier who had tried to search her. A stream of incoherent words.
<b> 
</b>tOther Algerians intervene; they push forward threateningly. The soldier 
tis young; he is timid and frightened. He looks over his back for help.

 tA police officer approaches. He has a different tone, and a very self-
tassured manner. He shouts at the Algerians to calm down.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttOFFICER
</b>ttAre you mad, touching one of their women? 
ttGo on, go on, alright ... Go ahead, keep 
ttmoving!
<b> 
</b> tThe woman passes the blockade, but still continues her protest with a 
tshrill and unbearable voice.
<b> 
</b>
<b>40tRUE PHILIPPE. OUTSIDE. DAY. 8:35 A.M.
</b><b> 
</b> tAn Algerian woman walks along the sidewalk. She is elderly, fat, and is 
twearing a traditional costume with her face veiled. She walks slowly 
ttoward a bar, which has its tables outside, and already some customers.

tNear the bar, leaning against a wall, there is an Algerian who now 
tbegins to move and goes to meet the old woman. They greet one another 
twith much warmth, like a mother and son who haven't seen each other for 
ta long time.
<b> 
</b>tThey embrace, and the man searches at her breast among the folds of her 
tveil. He finds a revolver which is hung by a cord, and grabs it. They 
tare at ten or twelve feet distance from the bar. At a table, there is a 
tFrench soldier having coffee with cream, croissant, and an open 
tnewspaper.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian continues to embrace the old woman, and aims from above 
ther shoulders. Only one shot; the newspaper rips, the soldier tries to 
tget up again, his face full of blood. Then he collapses on the table.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian has hidden the revolver in the woman's veil. The two 
tseparate from their embrace. They seem terrified and surprised, and 
tmove away from each other in different directions while the people are 
trushing about and SHOUTING.
<b> 
</b>
<b>41tDE LA LYRE MARKET. OUTSIDE. DAY. 9:10 A.M.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe cries of the peddlers are loud and incoherent. An Algerian is 
tsquatting on his heels in front of his wares scattered on the ground:
tclusters of aromatic herbs, jars of spices. A youth is in front of him, 
tand from time to time, he looks around him. He seems to be waiting.

tNow he bends down and begins to rummage through the herbs. He selects a 
tbunch of mint, weighs it in his hand, and argues the price with the 
tpeddler.
<b> 
</b>tA policeman in the market passes nearby and watches. The youth waits a 
tsecond, then turns toward the back of the policeman, and stretches out 
this arm.
<b> 
</b>tHe has in his hand the bunch of mint; a revolver is hidden among the 
tgreens. He shoots twice.
<b> 
</b>tThe French policeman falls down. The youth drops the mint with the 
trevolver among the other herbs, and moves away in the midst of the
tcrowd.
<b> 
</b>
<b>42 tRUE DE BAR-EL-QUED. OUTSIDE. DAY. 10:15 A.M.
</b><b> 
</b>tIn front of the police station there are sandbags and a police guard at 
tduty with helmet and machine gun. The policeman jumps to attention and 
tsalutes. An officer has come out of the station and returns his salute. 
tHe moves away and walks along the sidewalk.
<b> 
</b>tThere are few people. An Algerian seems to appear from nowhere, and 
twalks behind him. He is very young, is wearing a short-sleeved shirt 
tand blue jeans.
<b> 
</b>tThe officer turns at the first corner. Further on, there is a row of 
tcars and a metallic sign which warns that the parking space is reserved 
tfor police vehicles only.
<b> 
</b>tThe officer hears the steps of the boy behind him, and summons him in a 
tbrusque manner.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttOFFICER
</b>ttWhat are you doing here? Where are you

<b> 
</b>tThe boy shrugs his thin, shoulders and lowers his head.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBOY

ttI'm going for a swim; my friends are 
ttwaiting for me.
<b> 
</b>tThe officer curses under his breath and proceeds. He stops in front of 
ta Dyna-Panhard, parked not too far away. 

tThe boy moves on a few yards past the automobile until he reaches a 
tmetallic wastebasket which is fastened to the pole of a street lamp. He 
tstops there, then glances around. 

tThe officer is not far behind him; he has taken his car keys from his 
tpocket, and is about to open the car door. The boy plunges his hand 
tinto the basket, rummages among the torn papers, then suddenly turns, 
tpoints a revolver at the officer's back, and shoots.
<b> 
</b>tThe man tries to clutch something, but slips and falls down. The boy 
tshoots again at the man on the ground, then plunges his hand again into 
tthe wastebasket, drops the revolver, and glances around him. He breaks 
tinto a run.
<b> 
</b>tThe policemen come out of the police station hurriedly. 

<b>tWHISTLES, ORDERS, EXCITED CRIES.
</b><b> 
</b>tThey turn the corner. Some rush to the man lying on the ground. Others 
tjump into a jeep. Four of them jump on motorcycles that are lined up in
 tthe rack. They move off in two directions.

tAt the same time, wails of police sirens moving nearer are heard in the 
tdistance. The street is deserted. There is no trace of the boy. 

tPeople are seen at their windows. The officer is lifted by his arms.
<b> 
</b>tAn ambulance arrives and stops, its siren at full blast, its doors wide 
topen. The officer is placed inside.
<b> 
</b>tThe motorcycles are racing through the sidestreets. The jeep converges 
ton them, then reverses its direction, moving while balanced on two 
twheels.
<b> 
</b>tPassersby stop to watch, all of them Europeans. The siren's wail is at 
ta high pitch.

</b>
<b>43tADJACENT STREETS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b> tA deserted street, recently covered with wet asphalt. 

tA Moslem road worker is sitting on the ground next to a steamroller. 
tHe is eating his lunch. The combined sounds of the siren's wail and the 
trumbling of the motorcycles are heard approaching.
<b> 
</b>tTwo motorcyclists appear in the street, passing by the road worker.

tOne of them stops and turns around.
<b> 
</b>tThe road worker moves backward to the street corner. He breaks into a 
trun. His eyes are burning with fear, his face is anxious, undecided.

tFrom the windows, the people point to him, and shout after him.

tA jeep appears in the street in front of him. 

tThe motorcyclist approaches from the opposite direction. 

tThe Algerian stops running; he doesn't know what to do. 

tFrom the windows, continuous SHOUTING.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian leans against the wall, watches the scene, and begins to 
tcry. The policemen jump down from the jeep and leap at him. The 
tAlgerian isn't able to speak, but only shakes his head.
<b> 
</b>
<b>44tPOLICE STATION. INSIDE. DAY.

tA room inside the police station. The Algerian's face is beaten from 
tright and left by a series of slaps.

theard SHOUTS.

</b><b>ttttVARIED VOICES
</b>ttDo you know he's dead, you bastard? Do you

tThey try to reach him, pushing against one another in order to get 
tcloser and hit him. The Algerian is crying and speaks in broken-off 
tphrases, half Arabic and half French. His continual efforts to repeat 
tcertain words are heard: 

<b>ttttALGERIAN
</b>ttNo, no, no, no, ... me no ... Viva

tAn officer arrives making his way.

<b>ttttOFFICER
</b>ttGet out, go on, outside ... Get out of

tThe employee leaves and closes the door. The Assistant Commissioner

tfollows it with his glance in that tangle of streets.

<b>ttttASSISTANT COMMISSIONER

tTwo children, five or six years old, blond, charming, but not affected. 
tThey seem to be twins, and are wearing identical pajamas.

tAt the same time, a servant is preparing their beds for the night. She 
tis about fifty years old, her apron clean and ironed; she has gray 
thair, her face that of a good woman. She is Algerian.  When the 
tchildren falter in their prayers, she helps them. When they have 
tfinished she says with an Algerian accent:

<b>ttttSERVANT
</b>ttNow, let's go to say good night.
<b> 
</b> tIn the dining room, there is a large open window. The beach, the sea, 
tand the sound of the surf are outside, not too distant. It is a starry 
tnight. At a table, there are four men and four women, all of them well 
tdressed and tanned. It is the home of Henry and Bernadette Arnaud. The 
tAssistant Commissioner is in plain clothes. He and his wife seem ill at 
tease, somewhat out of place.
<b> 
</b>tThe maid and children have entered the room.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBERNADETTE
</b>ttCome here, children. Say hello ...

<b>ttttCHILDREN 
</b>ttGood evening ...

tThe others smile. The servant accompanies the children to their 
tparents.

<b>ttttCHILDREN
</b>ttGood night, daddy. Good night, mommy. 

<b>ttttBERNADETTE 
</b>ttGood night, dear.
<b> 
</b>tThey kiss. At the same time the women make the usual delighted 
texclamations. One of the men attracts the Assistant Commissioner's 
tattention, points to his watch, and makes a sign.

tThe Assistant Commissioner nods his head affirmatively.
<b> 
</b>
<b>47tALGERIAN STREETS. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.

</b> tA DS Citroen is crossing the city at high speed.

tThe four men are inside. Arnaud is at the wheel. The Assistant

</b>
<b>48 tCASBAH ENTRANCE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe automobile arrives at Place du Gouvernement, takes a turn around 
tthe square, then turns toward the blockade, and slows down.

tOne of the soldiers moves to the center of the ramp, and raises the 
tphosphorescent flag. The car lowers its headlights and stops.

tThe soldier goes to the driver's window. In his right hand, he is 
tholding a machine gun which hangs from his shoulders. He greets them.
<b> 
</b>tHe bends to window level:

<b>ttttSOLDIER 
</b>ttGood evening ...

tArnaud responds in an innocent, cheerful tone: 

<b>ttttARNAUD
</b>ttGood evening ... Can we pass?

<b>ttttSOLDIER 
</b>ttIt's too late. No one is allowed to enter 
ttthe Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.

<b>ttttARNAUD
</b>ttBut it's not even midnight yet!

<b>ttttSOLDIER 
</b>ttIt's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew 
ttbegins at midnight.

<b>ttttARNAUD
</b>ttPlease, we just want to take a short ride. 
ttA friend of mine has never seen the 
ttCasbah.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSOLDIER 
</b>ttI'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of 
ttthe question.
<b> 
</b>tThe Assistant Commissioner intervenes with the self-assured and 
tsomewhat arrogant tone common to all policemen. He stretches his arm 
ttoward the window and hands the soldier a card.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
</b>ttIt's alright, they're with me. 

tThe soldier examines the card by the glare of the headlights, hands it 
tback, and bringing his hand to his visor, he salutes. 

<b>ttttSOLDIER 
</b>ttOkay, sir. Go ahead.
<b>      
</b>tThe Assistant Commissioner salutes with his hand.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
</b>ttLet's go, Henry. 

<b>ttttARNAUD 
</b>ttt(he changes gears)
ttThank you. Good evening. 

tThe soldier steps aside, and salutes again.

tThe automobile begins to move, steadily increasing its speed.


<b>49tCASBAH STREET. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. 
</b>
tThe streets of the Casbah are deserted, almost completely blackened. 
tSome cats are frightened by the headlights and run close to the walls.
<b> 
</b>tInside the car the four men are silent. They keep their eyes fixed 
tstraight ahead of them, their faces concentrating, taut.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNAUD 
</b>ttThis way?

<b>ttttASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
</b>ttYes, it's the first intersection ... or 
ttthe second.
<b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>50tRUE DE THxc8BES. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe automobile slows down at the first intersection. Arnaud leans out 
tthe window and looks. There is an enamel nameplate -- RUE DE THxc8BES.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNAUD 
</b>ttRight or left?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
</b>ttTry going to the right. 

tThe car turns right, moving slowly.
<b> 
</b>tOn one side of the street, the even numbers are getting higher: 26 ... 
<b>t28 ... 30 ...
</b><b> 
</b><b>ttttARNAUD 
</b>ttWhat number is it?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
</b>ttEight.
<b>      
</b>tThe man next to the Assistant Commissioner says:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttFRIEND
</b>ttLet's park here. It doesn't matter.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
</b>ttt(in sharp tone) 
ttIt does matter. Go back, Henry. Let's go 
ttto number eight.
<b> 
</b>tArnaud puts the gears in reverse; the car moves back quickly and passes
 tthe intersection: 16 ... 14 ... 12 ... 10 ... 8... it stops.

tArnaud puts it in neutral. With the motor still running, he presses the 
tcigarette lighter on the dashboard.

tThe Assistant Commissioner takes a large package that he is holding 
tunder his legs on the car floor. It is wrapped in pieces of newspaper. 
tHe lifts it forward. The man who is next to Arnaud takes it, leans it 
tagainst the back of his seat, touches it until he finds the right spot, 
tunwraps it from that part, and straightens a small plastic tube which 
tappears at the opening. It is a fuse.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttARNAUD 
</b>ttHow long do you want the timing device? 

<b>ttttFRIEND
</b>ttFive minutes. Give me a match ...
<b> 
</b>tArnaud takes the cigarette lighter from the dashboard.
<b> 
</b>tThe other man has opened the car door. He takes the lighter and touches 
tit to the fuse which ignites immediately. The door of number eight is 
tvery near, almost directly opposite the car door. 
<b> 
</b>tThe man places the package in a shady area and returns to the car in a 
trun. Arnaud has already changed gears, releases the clutch, and the 
tautomobile shoots forward.
<b> 
</b>
<b>51tRUE DE THxc8BES. EXPLOSION. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. AUGUST 11, 1956. 12:20 A.M.
</b>
tThe explosion is very violent. The fronts of buildings number eight, 
tten, and twelve explode and collapse. 

<b>tEXPLOSION.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe echo of the explosion has ended. There is a long pause, only some 
tisolated noises resound. They are stressed, recognizable: a burning 
tbeam, the thud of falling debris, broken glass ...

tThen suddenly and almost simultaneously with the other sounds, after 
tthe shock, the human voices, the shouts and weeping are heard.

<b>tVOICES, SHOUTS, WEEPING.
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>52tRUE DE THxc8BES. OUTSIDE. DAWN.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe dawn's light is clear and white. It dispels every shadow and 
tdesigns precisely every outline. Here and there, in the middle of the 
tsky, there are numerous clouds of dust, strangely motionless. In the 
tlight, the human figures seem black. Seen from a distance, they seem to 
tbe ants upon heaps of debris. There are women, motionless, weeping 
tsoftly, their voices similar to prayer. From time to time, there is a 
tsudden scream, a despairing sob, someone running.

tAnother corpse is pulled out from the rubble, bodies mutilated or still 
tintact -- they are all dead.

tThe people continue to rummage through the debris and to wait around 
tpitifully.
<b> 
</b>
<b>53tCASBAH STREETS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b>
tBut there is no pity in the other streets and alleys of the Casbah, or 
tat the top of the steps. There is anger and hatred. The people are 
trunning and shouting.

tThey are shouting from their windows and balconies:
<b> 
</b><b>tJU-JU.
</b><b> 
</b>tThey smother every other sound. The excitement increases. They run 
twhere there is more shouting, more people. They don't know what to do 
tyet, but want to be together. Until there is a voice stronger and 
tclearer than the others which gives them a goal and direction.

tAli la Pointe points below beyond the slopes of the alleys and 
tstairways. There below are the European quarters which widen near the 
tsea.
<b> 
</b>tThe crowd is shouting, pushing, rushing forward with him, like a raging 
tstream, tumultuous and unrestrainable. Ali is together with his men, 
tfive boys, one of them older than twenty. All of them are armed. The 
tcrowd forces them to quicken their step to a run.

tPetit Omar is furthest in the rear. He is wearing a pair of short 
tpants, his chest bare; he is barefoot. He calls Ali with all his might, 
tbut in vain.

tHe tries to join Ali, to make his way through the legs of the others; 
the runs, clinging to the others, pushes, passes near the walls; then, 
tturning into a side-street, he rushes into an alleyway, and finally 
tarrives in front. He runs to Ali, almost out of breath.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPETIT OMAR 
</b>ttt(shouting)
ttKader says to stop them! He says we've 
ttgot to stop them!
<b> 
</b>tAli slows down as much as he can with the crowd pushing him from 
tbehind.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttWhere's Kader?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPETIT OMAR 
</b>ttWith the others. They are trying to stop 
ttthe people.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttGo away.

tTheir voices can hardly be heard or understood amid the loud noises.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPETIT OMAR 
</b>ttBut he says that if we go on like this, 
ttwe're playing their game, and they'll 
ttmurder everyone ... Stop, Ali!
<b> 
</b>tAli continues to run. His face is sullen, frowning, as always when he 
tmust choose between instinct and reason. Omar calls him again. His 
tvoice is hysterical, repeating again to stop. He is hanging on one of 
tAli's arms. Ali jerks himself free violently; he strikes the child. 
tOmar sways and falls against the wall.

tWith this movement, Ali seems to release his anger at not being able to 
tcarry out his actions.

tHe slows down, speaks to his men, a few words in Arabic, his voice cold 
tand bitter.
<b> 
</b>tAli extends his arm and the others imitate him. Each man grabs another 
tby the arm, forming a chain. They check the flow behind them and hold 
tback the crowd that is pressing forward.
<b> 
</b>
<b>54 tKADER'S HOUSE. INSIDE. DAY. SEPTEMBER 30, 1956.
</b><b> 
</b>tDjamila, the girl who in January, in rue Random, gave the revolver to 
tAli la Pointe, is now standing in front of a large mirror. She removes 
tthe veil from her face. Her glance is hard and intense; her face is 
texpressionless. The mirror reflects a large part of the room: it is a 
tbedroom. There are three other girls.
<b> 
</b>tThere is Zohra, who is about the same age as Djamila. She undresses, 
tremoving her traditional costume, and is wearing a slip ...

tThere is Hassiba who is pouring a bottle of peroxide into a basin. She 
tdips her long black hair into the water to dye it blond.

tEvery action is performed precisely and carefully. They are like three 
tactresses preparing for the stage. But there is no gaiety; no one is 
tspeaking. Only silence emphasizes the detailed rhythm of their 
ttransformation ...

tDjamila's lightweight European dress of printed silk ...

tZohra's blouse and short skirt to her knees ... make-up, lipstick, 
thigh-heeled shoes, silk stockings ...

tHassiba has wrapped her hair in a towel to dry it ... a pair of blue 
tjeans, a striped clinging tee-shirt ...

tHer blond hair is now dry. She ties it behind in a ponytail. Hassiba 
thas a young, slim figure. She seems to be a young European girl who is 
tpreparing to go to the beach. 

tContinual silence. Djamila and Zohra have finished their preparations 
tand sit down to wait. Hassiba is still barefoot. She is putting on her 
tsandals, when someone knocks at the door.
<b> 
</b>tDjamila gets up and goes to open it. 

tIt is Kader.

tA quick attentive glance; Djamila ... Zohra ... Hassiba ...

tHassiba responds to his look with a gay and somewhat coquettish 
texpression; she says, stressing her French:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHASSIBA
</b>ttxc7a va, monsieur?
<b> 
</b> tKader smiles for a second, without any gaiety, but to please her. Then
the speaks briefly and harshly in Arabic. And turning one at a time to
 teach of the three, he gives them three addresses.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttt(to Djamila)
ttNumber three rue de Chxeane.
ttt(to Zohra)
ttNumber fourteen rue Monseigneur Leynaud. 
ttt(to Hassiba)
ttNumber twenty-one rue de l'Hydre.
<b> 
</b>tEach one of the girls repeats, in turn, the address which he has given 
ther. Each one of the three responds emotionally. The atmosphere is 
ttense. Kader bids them farewell according to the Algerian custom, first 
tbringing his right hand over his heart. Then he embraces them.

tThey look at him for a moment; they are embarrassed. Kader tries to 
tease their discomfort, smiles, and answers Hassiba's previous remark.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttxc7a va ... Et bonnes chances!
<b> 
</b>
<b>55tRUE DE L'HYDRE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. 5:45 P.M.
</b><b> 
</b>tAt number twenty-one rue de l'Hydre, there is a bread store. Hassiba 
thas again covered her face with a veil, and is also wearing a white 
tcloak which covers her whole body. 

tShe enters the store. There are other women who are buying bread. 
tHassiba waits for them to leave, then says in Arabic to the shopkeeper:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHASSIBA
</b>ttI've come to take the package ...
<b> 
</b>tThe shopkeeper empties half a basket of bread; at the bottom, there is 
ta beach bag with a shoulder-strap, and he gives it to Hassiba.

tHassiba hides it under her cloak, bends her head in a sign of farewell, 
tand leaves.
<b> 
</b>
<b>56tRUE MONS. LEYNAUD. INSIDE. DAY. 5:45 P.M. 
</b>
tAt number fourteen rue Monseigneur Leynaud, there is a tailor shop and 
tclothing store. Zohra is also wearing the veil and white cloak. She 
tenters.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttZOHRA
</b>ttI've come to take the package ...
<b> 
</b>tThe tailor accompanies her to the back of the shop, where there is a 
tworkroom and young girls who are sewing. He rummages in a closet, takes 
tout an Air France utility bag and gives it to Zohra who hides it under 
ther cloak, greets him, and leaves.
<b> 
</b>
<b>57tRUE DU CHxcaNE. INSIDE. DAY. 
</b>
tInside number three rue du Chxeane, an Algerian craftsman is working in 
tfiligree. Djamila takes a small leather cosmetic case.

tDjamila hides it, greets the man, and leaves.
<b> 
</b>
<b>58tALLEY AND BLOCKADE. RUE MARENGO. INSIDE/OUTSIDE. DAY. 6:05 P.M. 
</b>
tAt an intersection of rue Marengo, an alley, Hassiba enters a large 
tdoor, and shuts it. In a second, she has removed her veil and cloak. 
tHer face is made up; she is wearing pants and a jersey top. She places 
tthe strap of her bag on her shoulder.
<b> 
</b>tInside the bag, a towel and bathing suit are visible. 

tHassiba goes out the door, proceeds down the alley until she reaches 
true Marengo. She approaches the blockade. 

tIt is Saturday evening; there is a hurried bustle of Algerians and 
tEuropeans. Soldiers and policemen, are very busy with their usual 
trequests for documents.

tHassiba's arrival is quickly noticed for she is very pretty and 
tattracts much attention. Some soldiers whistle.

tAn elderly Algerian woman looks at her with dislike. Hassiba is 
tindifferent and waits her turn. A French soldier approaches her.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSOLDIER
</b>ttI'd like to search you, Miss ...

tFor an instant, Hassiba is dismayed; then, she glances down at her 
tclinging shirt and pants.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHASSIBA 
</b>ttt(innocently)
ttWhere?
<b>      
</b>tThe boy is young, handsome, and cheeky. 

<b>ttttSOLDIER
</b>ttNot here. There's too many people.

<b>ttttHASSIBA 
</b>ttBut you don't understand. I was saying 
ttthat there's nothing to search.

<b>ttttSOLDIER
</b>ttThat's what you think!
<b> 
</b>tSome Europeans laugh, the Algerians seem not to see or hear, but it is 
tevident that they are scornful.

<b>ttttSECOND SOLDIER
</b>ttAre you going for a swim, Miss ... all by 
ttyourself?

<b>ttttHASSIBA 
</b>ttNo, with some friends.
<b>     
</b>tAt the same time, she passes the blockade. 

<b>ttttSECOND SOLDIER
</b>ttLucky them. Next Sunday I'm free .... Shall
ttwe go together?
<b>     
</b>tHassiba shrugs her shoulders, smiles again, and moves away.
<b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>59tBLOCKADE RUE DU DIVAN. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tAt the rue du Divan blockade, Zohra too is dressed like a European, and 
tseems to be calm.
<b> 
</b>tThere are not too many people. A soldier makes a sign for her to pass 
tin a hurried manner, and the girl passes.
<b> 
</b>
<b>60tBLOCKADE RUE DE LA LYRE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tDjamila is tense, pale, her features are strained. Her eyes seem even 
tlarger with make-up. Now, at the blockade at rue de la Lyre, the Casbah 
texit is blocked. An Algerian has been discovered without documents. He 
targues, shouts, and says that he wants to go back. 

<b>tINCOHERENT VOICES.
</b>
tThe soldiers try to catch him, he struggles to get free. 

tMeanwhile the people push forward in protest. Two soldiers catch the 
tAlgerian, and drag him bodily into the guard posts. The flow of people 
tcontinues.

tDjamila steps forward, holding the cosmetic-case with both of her 
thands. She doesn't know how to carry it, and from time to time she 
tchanges her position. She realizes that she looks awkward.

tIt's now her turn. The soldiers' tone is arrogant. The previous scene 
thas made them nervous. An officer signals her to pass, then points to 
tthe cosmetic-case.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttOFFICER 
</b>ttWhat's inside?
<b> 
</b> tInstinctively, Djamila lifts the case and looks at it; she feels 
therself failing, but makes an effort to answer.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDJAMILA 
</b>ttHere?

<b> ttttOFFICER 
</b>ttThere ...
<b> 
</b>tDjamila uses all her strength to smile and she succeeds. Her eyes light 
tup defiantly.

</b><b> ttttDJAMILA 
</b>ttt(provocatively)
ttNothing. 

tThe officer signals her to pass.
<b> 
</b>
<b>61tFISH-MARKET. INSIDE. DAY. 6:15 P.M.
</b><b> 
</b>tA large warehouse in the fish-market. There are enormous iceboxes with 
tcartons of frozen fish and tubs with running water and live fish. The 
tthree girls are next to one another. 

tThe three bags are on top of the counter, a few steps away. With them 
tis a thin Algerian about twenty-five years old. He has thick black 
thair, straight and combed neatly. He is wearing glasses. With his rough 
tand nervous hands, he pulls out the towel and bathing suit from 
tHassiba's bag, then delicately and carefully, a square wooden box. He
topens it, and turning to the girl, signals her to move away a bit. The 
tgirl steps back. In the box, there is a huge iron tube, sealed at both 
tends by two clock dials. Inside the tube, two batteries with wires are 
tattached to the dials. The youth glances at his wristwatch, then 
tadjusts the hands of the dials to six forty-five. He puts the bomb back 
tinto the box, closes it, and places it in the bag. He replaces the 
ttowel and bathing suit, then hands the bag to Hassiba. He is smiling 
tslightly. 

tHassiba takes the bag and goes away.

tThe box fits perfectly into Djamila's cosmetic-case. The youth opens it 
twithout removing it from the case, adjusts the two dials to six fifty, 
tputs everything back in its place, and hands the case to Djamila. He 
tsmiles at her and she moves away. In the Air France bag, there are 
tnewspapers and magazines on top, and the same box. The youth adjusts 
tthe bomb to six fifty-five, arranges it again inside the bag, closes 
tthe zipper, and hands the bag to Zohra. He smiles at her. His smile is 
tmore genuine, less mechanical. There is less tension than before.

tThe youth smiles at the girl and says in Arabic:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttALGERIAN
</b>ttMay Allah protect you.
<b> 
</b>tZohra thanks him in a whisper, bends her head, and moves away. The 
tyouth takes a cigarette from his shirt pocket, places it between his 
tlips, and lights it. His hand is trembling a little.
<b> 
</b>
<b>62tCAFETERIA RUE MICHELET. INSIDE. DAY. 6:30 P.M.
</b><b> 
</b>tCafeteria, rue Michelet 1. The club is very crowded. There are two 
trooms; one at the entrance with an American-style bar, and one at the 
tback with tables. It is Saturday, and at this hour many European
tfamilies go out to have an ice cream. There is not too much confusion 
tor uproar. The people are calm, they take their places at the bar and 
tsmall tables, and eat their ice cream while chatting quietly.

tHassiba enters, glances at the large clock above the cash register. It 
tis half past six. She goes to the register and waits her turn. The 
tdifferent orders mingle; she orders a Coca-Cola. They give her the 
tcheck. She pays.

tShe goes to the bar; all the seats are taken. She gives her order and 
tthe ticket to the waiter.
<b> 
</b>tA man moves aside, looks at her, then steps down from his stool and 
toffers it to her.
<b> 
</b>tHassiba tells him that it doesn't matter, but the man insists. Hassiba 
tthanks him and sits down. The man is about fifty, well groomed. He 
tsmiles again, and turns to chat with some friends.

tHassiba settles herself more comfortably on the seat, then removes the 
tbag from her shoulder. Holding it by the strap, she places it on the 
tfloor below the counter behind the brass railing used to lean one's 
tfeet.
<b> 
</b>tThe waiter has brought her the drink. Hassiba drinks slowly, from time 
tto time glancing at the clock. She finishes drinking. The bag is in a 
tvertical position.
<b> 
</b>tMoving her feet slowly and carefully, Hassiba lets the bag slip on its 
tside.
<b> 
</b>tShe gets down from the seat, and points it out to the man who is 
tstanding next to her. 

<b>ttttHASSIBA
</b>ttI'm giving your seat back. 

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttAre you already leaving, Miss? 

tHassiba smiles, nods yes.

tplaying full blast. It is a bar for young people. There is much bustle 
tand confusion, much laughter. The girls are making plans for Sunday.

tDjamila enters and moves to the jukebox which is in the corner near the 
tdoor. There are playbills for various theater performances hanging on
 tthe wall. Djamila stops to look at them and reads the bottom lines. She 
tplaces the cosmetic-case on the floor. Rising again she looks around 
ther, and pushes the case behind the jukebox with her foot ...

</b>
<b>64 tAIR FRANCE. IMMEUBLE MAURETANIA. INSIDE. DAY.

</b>tMaison Blanche, Immeuble Mauretania. The entire ground floor is filled 
twith ticket counters and a waiting room for the airlines. There are 
tsome employees, stewardesses and some travelers.
<b> 
</b>tZohra passes through the large glass door at the entrance, goes to the 
tAir France counter, takes a time schedule, then goes to sit down on a 
tsofa which runs along the opposite wall. She sits down and places the 
tairline bag on the ground in front of her, and begins to leaf through 
tthe timetable, from time to time glancing around. Using her heels, she 
tpushes the bag under the sofa.

tShe looks at the large electric clock which is hanging in the center of 
tthe room; it is forty minutes past six.

</b><b> 
</b><b>65tCAFETERIA RUE MICHELET. INSIDE. DAY.

</b>tIt is six forty-four by the cafeteria clock. The second hand is moving.
 tThere are more or less the same people. The old man is still seated on
 tthe barstool, and continues to chat.

tHassiba's bag is still at his feet; the second hand is racing. A five-
tyear-old child hands a coin to the waiter:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCHILD
</b>ttIce cream ...

tThe father and mother are watching him, delighted. The waiter smiles at 
tthe child and points to the cash register. He speaks to the child in 
tthe usual tone of a grownup when speaking to children:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttWAITER
</b>ttYou have to go there first ... and then 
ttcome back to me.

tThe second hand reaches twenty-five, then thirty. The child goes to the 
tcashier and pays. The cashier smiles at him and gives him the check.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCASHIER
</b>ttWhat a good boy ...

tThe child returns to the counter. The waiter has already prepared the 
tice cream for him, and hands it to him. The child is standing on

tand move away. The jukebox is again loud: "Brigitte Bardot, Bardot ..." 

tThe people re-enter the bar, chattering, to have their apxe9ritifs. It is 
tsix fifty: the explosion.
<b> 
</b>
<b>68 tMILK BAR. EXPLOSION. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe jukebox is flung into the middle of the street. There is blood,
 tstrips of flesh, material, the same scene as at the Cafeteria; the 
twhite smoke and shouts, weeping, hysterical girls' screams. One of them 
tno longer has an arm and runs around, howling despairingly; it is 
timpossible to control her. The sound of sirens is heard again. The 
tcrowd of people, the firemen, police, ambulances all rush to the scene 
tfrom Place Bugeand.

tThe ambulances arrive at rue Michelet.

tThey are already loaded with dead and wounded. The relatives of the 
twounded are forced to get out. The father of the child who was buying 
tice cream seems to be in a daze: he doesn't understand.

tThey pull him down by force. The child remains there, his blond head a 
tclot of blood.
<b> 
</b>tThe policemen try to bring order to the chaos, are forced to shout, 
tpush, threaten. The wounded swarm around the ambulances. A Commissioner 
tsends off the first one.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttCOMMISSIONER
</b>ttWhat time is it?
<b> 
</b><b> ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttA quarter to seven.
<b> 
</b> tThe Commissioner goes to the second ambulance, pulls down a man who is 
ttrying to enter by force, slams the door, and shouts to the driver. His 
tface is pale and drawn; the veins of his neck are swollen.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCOMMISSIONER 
</b>ttGo away, for God's sake!
<b> 
</b>tThe auto leaves and now, the third explosion resounds in the distance. 
tIt is heard clearly and violently from the Mauretania section.

tThe Commissioner stops midway in his last gesture, and likewise, all 
tthe others, who are paralyzed with fright, incapable of taking action
tagain, of accepting such reality for a third time.

tIn Place Bugeand, there also, the people are motionless. All of them 
tare looking in the same direction. Their faces are alike in their 
tterror, alike in their sense of impotence, alike in their deep sadness.


<b>69tSTREET. EUROPEAN CITY. OUTSIDE. DAY. 
</b>
tThe sun appears, then hides behind black clouds. There is a cool wind.
 tIt is ten in the morning, and the European city has its usual rapid and 
tefficient rhythm of every day at this hour, only there is terror 
twritten on the face of every person. That same terror has remained, and 
tsuspicion, and despairing impotence.

tPatrols of soldiers and policemen move around the city, search 
tAlgerians and some Europeans, stop automobiles, trucks, buses, and 
ttrams that they block at both doors. 

tAt the entrance to every shop, the owner searches every customer before 
tletting him enter.
<b> 
</b>tHe does so politely with a drawn smile, and methodically rummages 
tthrough every handbag, every package. 

tSo too in the bars, in the offices, in workshops ... And now that it is 
talready late afternoon, also outside the brothels, the cinemas, the 
ttheaters.
<b> 
</b>
<b>70tLEMONS STREET. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
</b><b> 
</b>tA young Algerian boy thirteen or fourteen years old, wearing sandals
twithout socks, trousers that reach to his ankles, walks quickly 
tcarrying a cardboard box tied with a cord. It is dusk.
<b> 
</b>tA European woman sees him pass in front of her, looks at him, and 
tfollows him with her glance.
<b> 
</b>tOn the sidewalk there are some youths. The woman points to the Algerian 
tboy, says something. The traffic is heavy. Her words are unclear. One 
tyouth calls to the boy who is by now thirty feet away:

<b>ttttYOUTH
</b>ttHey, little rat ...
<b> 
</b>tThe boy turns around for a second, his face frightened, and quickens 
this step. The youths follow behind him and the boy begins to run. The 
tyouths too begin to run and others join them, people who are passing. 
tThey form a small mob and are shouting. The boy shoots into a
tsidestreet, drops his box, and races ahead.

tWhile some chase the boy, others stop around the box, make way, look 
tfor a policeman, a soldier, an officer. A circle continues to form 
taround the box. A patrol arrives. One of the soldiers has a Geiger 
tcounter. He moves near the box, carefully placing the counter above it, 
tthen ceasing to be prudent, he takes his bayonette, cuts the cord, and 
ttears open the box: lemons.
<b> 
</b>
<b>71tSTREET CORNER. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe boy has been cornered, surrounded, pinned down, kicked, hit with 
tumbrellas, until he is exhausted and can no longer defend himself. He 
tis no longer moving. He is lying on the ground, dead. The air is gray 
tnow, and slowly all the colors unite to form gray. Lights are lit in
tthe city and contrast with the whiteness of the Casbah high above. The 
tsky is still clear, the black profiles of the mountains, the straight 
tcoasts on the sea, the sea itself that seems to be land until it 
treaches the horizon where the moon rises between the clouds.

<b>72tSEA-FRONT. OUTSIDE. DAY. JANUARY 10, 1957.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe European crowd applauds, their eyes aglow, their mouths wide open, 
tshouting and yelling, their teeth flashing in the sun. Clapping of 
tapplause on the sea-front of Algiers. Children, are held up to see, 
twaving small flags. The paratroopers of the Tenth Division march past.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSPEAKER
</b>tt"Mr. Raymond Lefevre, Inspector General 
ttof the Administration, has presided over 
tta meeting in which important decisions 
tthave been taken with the aim of securing 
ttpublic order and the protection of

ttit has been decided to recall the 'Tenth'

ttfor the maintenance of order in Algiers, 
ttand will have at his disposal in order to 
ttachieve this goal, all civil and military 
ttmeans provided for the defense of the 
ttzone."
<b> 
</b>tMassu and the authorities are standing on the balconies of the 
tPrefecture building.
<b> 
</b>tThe paras are marching, their sleeves rolled up, their faces sunburned. 
tMachine guns, bazookas, crew-cuts, the eyes of singing boys, silent 
tsteps, one battalion after another. 

tThe dragon "black berets" pass by ...

tThe "red berets" of the 2nd Regiment of colonial paratroopers ...

t"Les casquettes" of the 3rd Regiment parade by; "les hommes-peints,"
tMathieu's paras.
<b> 
</b>tColonel Mathieu is at the head of the regiment. He is tall, slender, 
tover fifty. He has thinning gray hair, a lean face, blue eyes, and a 
twide forehead. His face is lined with many wrinkles. Were it not for 
tthe uniform, the weapons, his tanned skin, his manner of walking, and 
this energetic voice when giving orders, he wouldn't seem a soldier, but 
tan intellectual.
<b> 
</b> tThe 3rd Regiment colonial paratroopers are now before the Commissioner.

<b> 
</b>
<b>73tVILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tIn a villa in the military headquarters, a reception room is visible 
tthrough a large window on the first floor. There are about twenty 
tofficers seated in rows of chairs as if for a lecture. Mathieu is in 
tfront of them and he is speaking while standing next to a desk. At his 
tback there is a blackboard, and near it, a large map with pyramid 
tgraphs, cells, arrows, crossmarks, and, above them, the title: 
<b>tSTRUCTURE NLF AUTONOMOUS ZONE OF ALGIERS.
</b>
tMathieu's voice has nothing of the military and traditional. His tone 
tis neither harsh nor cold, but rather kind and pleasing; from it
 temanates a superior authority imposed by reason and not by position.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttThe result is that in the last two 
ttmonths, they have reached an average of 
tt4.2 assaults per day, including 
ttaggression against individuals, and the 
ttexplosions. Of course, the conditions of 
ttthe problem are as usual: first, the 
ttadversary; second, the method to destroy 
tthim ... There are 80,000 Arabs in the 
ttCasbah. Are they all against us? We know 
ttthey are not. In reality, it is only a 
ttsmall minority that dominates with 
ttterror and violence. This minority is 
ttour adversary and we must isolate and 
ttdestroy it ...
<b> 
</b>tWhile speaking, he goes to the window, and pulls down the shade. He 
tinterrupts his speech, points to the rest of the window:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttDraw it down there too ...
<b> 
</b>tTwo or three officers stand up to perform the task. At the back of the 
troom there is a movie projector. 

tNext to it there is a para who is preparing to operate it. 

tThe other shades are drawn, and gradually the room is darkened.

tMathieu, meanwhile, has resumed speaking:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttHe is an adversary who shifts his 
ttposition above and below the surface with 
tthighly commendable revolutionary methods
 ttand original tactics. ... He is an 
ttanonymous and unrecognizable enemy who 
ttmingles with thousands of others who 
ttresemble him. We find him everywhere: in 
ttthe alleys of the Casbah; in the streets 
ttof the European city, and in working 
ttplaces.

tMathieu interrupts himself again and makes a signal to the back of the 
troom which is completely darkened.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU
</b>ttGo ahead, Martin.

tMartin turns on the projector. On the white wall next to the map and 
tgraph appear pictures of the Casbah. There are the blockades, the 
tbarbed wire, the metal screens, the Algerians who exit and enter, the 
tpolicemen and soldiers who examine documents and frisk someone. From 
ttime to time, close-ups of the pictures are shown, enlarged to the 
tminutest details, close-ups of faces, motionless images that last only 
tfor a few seconds.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttHere is some film taken by the police. 
ttThe cameras were hidden at the Casbah 
ttexits. They thought these films might be 
ttuseful, and in fact they are useful in 
ttdemonstrating the usefulness of certain 
ttmethods. Or, at least, their inadequacy.

tHassiba is now seen and the soldiers who are wooing her, while she 
tlaughs, jokes, flirts in a provocative manner, and passes the blockade.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttI chose these films because they were 
ttshot in the hours preceding some recent 
ttterroristic assaults. And so, among all 
ttthese Arabs, men and women, there are the 
ttones responsible. But which ones are they? 
ttHow can we recognize them? Controlling 
ttdocuments is ridiculous: one who has 
tteverything in order is most likely to be 
ttthe terrorist.

tAn Algerian is being dragged away while protesting, kicking, and trying 
tto free himself. And then the scene changes. There is another Casbah 
texit, and an Algerian who is being searched.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttNote the intuition of the cameraman. He 
ttrealized that in that box, there had to 
ttbe something of interest, and he paused 
ttto focus it.
<b> 
</b>tThe picture is enlarged. The small box which the Algerian is carrying 
ton his shoulder is seen in detail. It is opened. The box is swarming 
twith snakes; the soldier who had wanted to examine it jumps backward.

tThe officers in the room burst into laughter.

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttt(laughing)
ttMaybe the bomb was hidden right there, in 
tta double bottom. Who knows? We'll never 
ttknow.
<b> 
</b>tUsing the barrel of his machine gun, a soldier has closed the box. A 
tsnake has managed to jump out, and fallen to the ground. The people are 
tterrified and move away. Others laugh, among them, Petit Omar, who 
tseems to be an ordinary child enjoying himself. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttThat's enough, Martin ...

tThe lights are again switched on in the room. Mathieu is again next to 
tthe desk, and waits a second until the buzz of comments subsides.

<b>ttttMATHIEU
</b>ttWe must start again from scratch. The only 
ttinformation that we have concerns the 
ttstructure of the organization. And we 
ttshall begin from that ...

tHe takes a wooden pointer from the desk in order to illustrate the 
tgraph, while he speaks with the tone and precision of a university 
tprofessor.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttIt is a pyramid-like organization divided 
ttinto a series of sectors. At the top of 
ttthe pyramid is their General Staff. 

tHe has moved near the blackboard, and taken some chalk, and slowly as 
the speaks, he illustrates his speech. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttThe military commander responsible for 
ttthe executive body finds the right man 
ttand nominates him to responsibility for 
tta sector: number one. Number one in his 
ttturn, chooses another two: number two and 
ttnumber three ... And so they form the 
ttfirst triangle.

tHe has written high on the board a number one and below it, with some 
tspace between them, the numbers two and three. He unites the three 
tnumbers with lines and forms a triangle. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttNow number two and number three choose, 
ttin their turn, two men each ... number 
ttfour and five, and so on ...
<b> 
</b>tMathieu writes the new numbers, spacing them on the next line. Then he 
tunites two to four and five, and three to six and seven, forming two 
tnew triangles.
<b> 
</b>tMathieu has written other numbers and unites them to those of the 
tpreceding line and thus forms other triangles. Now the blackboard is 
tcovered by a series of triangles that form a large pyramid.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttThe reason for this geometry is so that 
ttevery militant will know only three 
ttmembers in the entire organization: his 
ttcommander who has chosen him, and the two 
ttmembers that he himself has chosen ... 
ttContacts take place only by written 
ttinstructions ... That is why we do not 
ttknow our adversaries: because, in 
ttpractice, they do not even know each 
ttother.

tMathieu leaves the blackboard and moves near the officers. The tone of 
this voice changes. The explanation is now finished. He gives 
tdirections ... 
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttTo know them means to eliminate them. 
ttConsequently, the military aspect is 
ttsecondary to the police method. I know we
 ttare not fond of this word, but it is the 
ttonly word that indicates exactly the type 
ttof work that we must perform. We must 
ttmake the necessary investigations in 
ttorder to proceed from one vertex to 
ttanother in the entire pyramid. The 
ttreason for this work is information. The 
ttmethod is interrogation. And 
ttinterrogation becomes a method when 
ttconducted in a manner so as to always 
ttobtain a result, or rather, an answer. 
ttIn practice, demonstrating a false 
tthumanitarianism only leads to the 
ttridiculous and to impotence. I am 
ttcertain that all the units will 
ttunderstand and react accordingly. 
ttHowever, success does not depend solely 
tton us. We need to have the Casbah at our 
ttdisposal. We must sift through it ... and 
ttinterrogate everyone. And here is where 
ttwe find ourselves hindered by a 
ttconspiracy of laws and regulations that 
ttcontinue to be operative, as if Algiers 
ttwere a holiday resort and not a 
ttbattleground. We have requested a carte 
ttblanche. But it is very difficult to 
ttobtain. Therefore, it is necessary to 
ttfind an excuse to legitimize our 
ttintervention, and make it possible. It 
ttis necessary to create it ourselves --
ttthis excuse. Unless our adversaries will 
ttthink of it themselves, which seems to be 
ttwhat they are doing.
<b> 
</b>
<b>74tALLEY UPPER CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b> tIt is not a song, but a type of spoken chorus, an assembly of young 
tvoices, words whispered from the throat, both high and low, and sudden 
tsilent pauses. It is monotonous; but it is just such a repetition, 
talways with the same pattern of tones -- high, low, then, silent -- 
tthat manages to transform itself into a motif, reach an excited pitch, 
tand acquire breadth and solemnity. The sound fills the alleys, rises 
ttoward the long rectangle of sky, and moves farther away as if it were 
tmeant to be heard by all.

tThe alley is narrow and sloping, with crumbling walls, tufts of grass,
 tand refuse. It is located at the outer periphery of the Casbah -- the 
tcountryside is in the background. An Algerian is walking with large 
tsteps; a five-year-old child is behind him, moving quickly, stumbling 
tfrom time to time on the pavement; although he does not cry, 
toccasionally he calls to his father, who proceeds forward, and does not 
tturn around. The chorus arises from behind them. It is incoherent. They 
tstop in front of a door; they have arrived. The door gives way and they 
tenter.
<b> 
</b>
<b>75tKORAN SCHOOL. INSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tA large room, like a shop or stable. Here too, on the ground and 
tpavement, there are tufts of grass. It is cold. The walls are 
tunplastered, the windows boarded. The roof is in sight, but not the 
tbeams. The roof is made of tiles and covered with a coat of whitewash.
<b> 
</b>tThere are about twenty children, five to eight years old, seated on the 
tfloor. The teacher is in front of them; he too is seated. He is 
tprompting the verses in a low voice, almost in a whisper, and the 
tchorus repeats it.
<b> 
</b>tThe Koran School: a bare, wobbling place.

tThe Algerian who has entered takes the child by his hand, and 
taccompanies him to the teacher who is now standing; the chorus 
tcontinues; the other children, do not look at the two who have just 
tentered.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian and the teacher greet each other, bringing their hands to 
ttheir hearts, and then to their mouths. At the same time, the teacher 
ttakes an envelope from under his tunic, and hands it over to the other.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSPEAKER 
</b>tt"To all militants! After two years of 
tthard struggle in the mountains and city, 
ttthe Algerian people have obtained a great 
ttvictory. The UN Assembly has placed the 
ttAlgerian question in its forthcoming 
ttagenda. The discussion will begin on 
ttMonday, January 28. Starting Monday, for 
tta duration of eight days, the NLF is 
ttcalling a general strike.  For the 
ttduration of this period, all forms of 
ttarmed action or attempts at such are 
ttsuspended. We are requesting that all 
ttmilitants mobilize for the strike's 
ttorganization and success."
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian has hidden the envelope inside his tunic, then presents 
tthe child to the teacher, who makes him sit down with the other 
tchildren The teacher also returns to his place and sits down, and 
tsuggests a new phrase; the chorus continues. The Algerian leaves the 
tschool.
<b> 
</b>
<b>76tALLEY UPPER CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY.

ttime descending, with hurried steps. The chorus continues, again heard 
tfrom without, but its echo is now different.

</b>tt"Algerian brothers! A great hope has 
ttarisen for us. The world is watching us. 
ttThe next few days may be decisive for our

</b>
<b>79tSEA-FRONT. OUTSIDE. DAY.

</b> tAt the sea-front, there is a newspaper boy, about twelve years old, 
tbarefoot. His voice is shrill yet cheerful. He is smiling.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttNEWSBOY 
</b>ttLe Monde! Le Monde! General strike! ... 
ttStrike! 

tSome Europeans buy the newspaper, half-heartedly, grumbling
tdisagreeably. The boy remains cheerful, places the change inside the 
tbag strapped to his shoulder, thanks them.
<b> 
</b>tNow he passes in front of a beggar, an elderly Algerian who is leaning 
tagainst a railing.

tThe boy winks at him, while he continues to shout:

<b>ttttSPEAKER
</b>tt"During the eight days of the strike, do 
ttnot frequent the European city, or leave

<b> 
</b>
<b>80tCASBAH STREETS AND SHOPS. INSIDE/OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tThere is a strange atmosphere in the Casbah. People are greeting each 
tother in the streets; a thick buzz of voices, a festive mood, a sense 
tof brotherhood, and the children, who are taking advantage of the 
tsituation and play and run everywhere.

tThe shops are unusually crowded. The people enter and exit, loaded with 
tsupplies. In the shops too, there is the same festive mood, almost as 
tif the supplies were for a trip to the country. The shopkeepers are 
talso cheerful.
<b> 
</b>tAnd the poor customers, instead of paying, hand over a ticket stamped 
<b>tNLF.

</b><b>81tCASBAH BLOCKADE. OUTSIDE. DAY. SUNSET. SUNDAY. JANUARY 27, 1957.
</b><b> 
</b>tLate afternoon, at the blockades of rue de la Lyre, rue du Divan, and 
true Marengo. The Casbah exit ramps are deserted, while the entrance 
tramps are overflowing with people. Here too, there is an intangible air 
tof gaiety, witty remarks, laughter, ironic glances toward the soldiers 
tand policemen with cold faces, immobile -- helmets and machine guns --
twho stand at the entrances without intervening.
<b> 
</b>tThe image is shortened and focused through the lenses of binoculars.
<b> 
</b>
<b>82tGOVERNMENT PALACE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. SUNSET.

tA paratrooper officer looks at the blockades of rue du Divan from a 
tGovernment Palace balcony. Mathieu is beside him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttNo one is leaving, eh?

tThe officer hands him the binoculars. 

<b>ttttOFFICER
</b>ttNo. They continue to enter, the rats.
<b> 
</b>tMathieu looks through the binoculars, and comments in a low voice, 
tsmiling:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttRats in a trap, we hope ...

<b>ttttOFFICER
</b>ttBut do you believe that the strike will 
ttbe widespread? 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttWithout a doubt.
<b> 
</b> tBehind the two officers, through a large open window, a room is 
tvisible. There is a large table, and around it, other high officers of 
tthe various armed forces, and some important officials in plainclothes.

tA general, who has his back to the balcony, turns and calls Mathieu:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGENERAL
</b>ttMathieu! Mathieu, a name ...

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttA name?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGENERAL
</b>ttYes, a name for the operation.
<b> 
</b>tMathieu moves the binoculars from the blockades and turns slowly around 
tthe Government square, until he reaches an advertising sign for a brand 
tof champagne which now, in the dusk, lights up with a sporadic rhythm: 
<b>tCORDON ... ROUGE.
</b><b> 
</b>tMathieu pauses then turns toward the room, and enters smiling:

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttChampagne ... All right? 

tThe general repeats absent-mindedly:

ttt(then, in a convinced voice) 
ttOperation Champagne, yes, alright.
<b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>83 tRUE DU DIVAN BLOCKADE. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
</b><b> 
</b>tAt the rue du Divan blockade, there is an incoherent, monotonous, and 
tirritating chant. There is a blind beggar. He is light-complexioned, 
ttall and thin, his beard long, his arms stretched out, a cane in his 
thand. He arrives at last at the entrance ramp, tries to find the way, 
tbut cannot. He tries again and again with his cane, continually 
trepeating his sorrowful chant, until a policeman takes him by his free 
thand, placing the hand roughly on the metal screen.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttPOLICEMAN
</b>ttGo on! Go on!
<b> 
</b>tThe beggar protests and waves his cane in a way that the policeman has 
tto duck to prevent himself from being hit. The policeman curses, 
tspitefully, coarsely.

tA soldier starts to laugh. The old man takes up his chant again, and 
tmoves forward leaning on the metal screen. On the other side of the 
tblockade, behind the square, there is a group of veiled girls who have 
tseen the old man, and seem to be waiting for him.

tTwo of them go to meet him, and each one takes one of his arms. At the 
ttouch of their hands, the old man is again infuriated. Even the girls 
tlaugh. Then, one of them speaks to him slowly in a loud voice.

tIt seems that the old man has understood. He is convinced. He mumbles 
tsomething kindly and lets them accompany him.
<b> 
</b>
<b>84tCASBAH ALLEY. FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
</b><b> 
</b>tA poorly lit alley. A group of unemployed men and beggars are standing 
tin front of a door.

<b> 
</b>tCourtyard and balcony.

tOn the terrace also, someone is looking toward the courtyard. Kader is 
ton the terrace together with a man about forty years old, dressed in 
tEuropean clothes, he has narrow shoulders and a sunken chest. His face 
tis sensitive, his forehead high, and his hair and eyes black. His eyes 
tare kind and thoughtful and twinkle with irony.

tHe is Ben M'Hidi, one of the four members of the CCE, the Central 
tExecutive Committee.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttt(to him)
ttThey are beggars and unemployed, homeless. 
ttWe have organized things in such a way 
ttthat during the strike they will be 
ttguests of other families who have homes 
ttand will provide shelter in the event of 
ttpossible reprisals ... But I didn't know 
ttthat they would be brought to this house 
tttoo. It is a mistake.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttBEN M'HIDI 
</b>ttWhy?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttBecause you are here too. It would be 
ttbetter for you to move to another house.
<b> 
</b>tBen M'Hidi moves away from the parapet. 

<b>ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttAll right ... You're the one who must 
ttdecide. 

tKader follows him along the terrace.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttNo, if I were the one to decide, you 
ttwouldn't be in Algiers now.
<b> 
</b>tBen M'Hidi looks at him, smiling.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEN M'HIDI 
</b>ttWhy? Isn't it wise?
<b> 
</b>tKader smiles too, and repeats:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttKADER 
</b>ttIt isn't wise.
<b> 
</b>tAt the end of the terrace, there is a construction raised to a level 
twith the stairs that lead to the floor below. There is a large room; 
tthrough the open door, the lighted interior is visible. The walls have 
thigh brick baseboards, and at the bottom of one of the four walls there 
tis a square opening that leads into a hiding place. The closure of the 
thiding place, a square of very thick wall, is placed to one side. Ali 
tla Pointe is covering it with bricks.
<b> 
</b>tOn the other side of the room next to the door, there are some cement 
twash-basins, and a shed for rain water. Kader appears at the door.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttAli, you must accompany Ben M'Hidi to the 
ttMaison des Arbres.
<b> 
</b>tAli doesn't answer immediately. He finishes placing the last brick then 
tturns to Kader.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttALI 
</b>ttWhy? Isn't he sleeping here?
<b> 
</b><b> ttttKADER 
</b>ttNo, it's better if he doesn't. The house 
ttis filled with new people.
<b> 
</b>tAli gets up, wipes his hands on his trousers, at the same time 
tinspecting the work that he has just completed. 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttHere's another one ready. What a hideout! 
ttIt really looks like a wall. I'll dirty 
ttit a bit, and it's perfect. Want to give 
tta look inside?
<b> 
</b>tKader has taken a machine gun from one of the basins, and he tosses it 
tto Ali, who catches it. 

<b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttNo, go now. It's already late.

tThey go out on the terrace. Ali releases the catch of his machine gun 
tso that the bullet slips into the barrel. 

<b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttt(to Ben M'Hidi)
ttThey are a family of militants from way 
ttback. Everything will work out well, 
ttyou'll see ... C'mon, Ali, hurry up.

<b>ttttBEN M'HIDI 
</b>ttAlright. See you tomorrow.

tThey say good-bye, embracing one another. Ali has already climbed over 
tthe terrace wall, and has jumped to the next one.

tBen M'Hidi follows him; he is less agile and moves with a bit of 
ttrouble.

tFrom the parapet, Kader says to him:

<b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttPassing along the terraces only takes 
ttfive minutes ... and with Ali la Pointe, 
ttyou'll be safe ...

tWhile jumping, Ben M'Hidi loses his balance, and has to grab on to Ali 
tto prevent himself from falling. 

<b>ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttBut it's he who won't be safe with me ...

tThe two figures move away from terrace to terrace, and disappear in the 
tdark.
<b> 
</b>
<b>86tCASBAH VIEWS AND TERRACES. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
</b><b> 
</b>tIn the dark in front of them, a metallic reflection is visible and the 
tsharp and aggressive sound of an Algerian voice is heard.

tAli responds to the password.
<b> 
</b>tA youth steps out from the shadows. He too is carrying a machine gun, 
trecognizes Ali, and greets him. Ali and Ben M'Hidi continue ...
<b> 
</b>
<b>87tMAISON DES ARBRES, TERRACE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. 
</b>
tUntil they arrive at a terrace which is separated from the next one by 
tan alley about ten feet wide. 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttHere it is ... we've arrived ... 

tBen M'Hidi glances at the emptiness beneath them, looks at Ali, and 
ttakes a deep breath.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEN M'HIDI 
</b>ttNot yet ...

tAli has climbed onto the parapet, looks around him concentrating 
tattentively for a moment, and then jumps into the void, reaching the 
topposite side. He bends, searches for something in the dark, and lifts 
ta type of gangplank.
<b> 
</b>tHe hands it over to Ben M'Hidi, and together they place it between the 
ttwo terraces.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttBe careful now. Unless you know how it 
ttworks, it's better if you sit on the plank 
ttand move forward like this ...

<b>ttttBEN M'HIDI 
</b>ttLet's try ...

tHe tries to stand up on the gangplank, but he lacks the necessary 
tsteadiness. He can't hold his balance. He does as Ali has advised him; 
the sits astride on the plank, and using the force of his arms, he 
tpushes himself forward. He stops halfway to rest for a minute. 

<b>ttttBEN M'HIDI 
</b>ttIt's good nobody is following us ...

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttIt's a question of habit ...

tAnd when Ben M'Hidi is closer, Ali helps him to get down to the terrace.

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttIt's better if I go first, to make sure 
tteverything's okay ...

tWithout waiting for an answer, he moves toward the stairway that leads 
tto the floor below; his movements are silent and graceful.

tBen M'Hidi leans out from the terrace, and looks toward the European 
tcity and the sea. At the port, two searchlights are lit, and their long 
tbright rays move slowly toward the Casbah ...

 tWhen Ali la Pointe returns, Ben M'Hidi is still leaning on the railing. 
tHe seems not to hear the sound of Ali's footsteps, or his voice.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttEverything's okay ... They're waiting for 
ttyou ...

tAli moves near him, and Ben M'Hidi turns and looks at him. 

<b>ttttBEN M'HIDI 
</b>ttWhat do you think of the strike, Ali? 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttI think it'll be a success ...

<b>ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttYes, I think so too ... It's been 
ttorganized well ... But what will the 
ttFrench do?
<b>      
</b>tBoth the question, and the answer seem obvious to Ali. 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttt(shrugging)
ttIt's clear. They'll do everything 
ttpossible to make it fail.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttNo, they'll do even more. We've given 
ttthem the opportunity to do a lot more ... 
ttDo you understand what I mean? Starting 
tttomorrow, they won't be groping in the 
ttdark any more; every shop and every 
ttworker who strikes will be a known enemy, 
tta self-confessed criminal ... And they 
ttwill be able to pass to the offensive. 
ttHave you thought of this?
<b> 
</b>tAli has listened attentively. The effort with which he is trying to ask 
thimself the meaning of these words is visible on his face.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttt(shaking his head)
ttNo ...
<b> 
</b><b> ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttBut Kader told me that you weren't in 
ttfavor of the strike.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttALI 
</b>ttNo, and neither were my men. 

<b> ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttWhy?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttBecause they told us that we mustn't use 
ttweapons, now, when the time is right.

<b> ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttThat's true ... Wars aren't won with 
ttterrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. 
ttTerrorism is a beginning but afterward, 
ttall the people must act ... This is the 
ttreason for the strike, and its necessity: 
ttto mobilize all Algerians, count them and 
ttmeasure their strength ...

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttTo show them to the UN, right?
<b> 
</b><b> ttttBEN M'HIDI 
</b>ttt(smiling slightly)
ttYes ... yes. The problem also involves the 
ttUN. I don't know what it's worth, but this 
ttway, we'll give the UN the possibility of 
ttevaluating our strength. 

tAli breathes deeply, instinctively, unrestrainedly, Ben M'Hidi watches 
thim, smiles, and says:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttDo you know something Ali? Starting a 
ttrevolution is hard, and it's even harder 
ttto continue it. Winning is hardest of all. 
ttBut only afterward, when we have won, 
ttwill the real hardships begin.
<b> 
</b>tHe pats Ali's back fondly with his hand and continues, smiling:

<b>ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttAnyway, there's still a lot to be done 
tt... you aren't already tired, Ali, are 
ttyou?
<b> 
</b>tAli looks at him, and without reacting to his irony: 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttt(with conviction)
ttNo!

<b>88 tVARIOUS HOUSES. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAWN. JANUARY 28, 1957. 
</b>
tIt is gray and smoky dawn, a slow reabsorption of the night, an opaque 
tlight which is diffused, sprayed, frozen, to transparency, and 
trediscovers its outlines and perspectives; and finally, the sun, golden 
tlight, awakens all Algiers. To the north, the sea. To the south, the 
tmountains and the Casbah, situated halfway along the coast. The Casbah, 
tstill, inert, expectant, on this first day of the strike ...

tThe paratroopers are already at their places, one after another, at 
tequal distances like links of a very long chain, strung through every 
talley, spreading to every sidestreet, twisting through the squares, 
tclimbing up the stairways, dividing, joining, and lengthening again. 
tThe silence is perfect; the camouflaged immobile forms seem to be part 
tof the landscape.

tThen a brief and sharp hiss, a hundred whistles together. 

tA signal releases the still forms: the attack begins. 

tDoors are beaten down, shots, screams, rifle fire, machine gun fire; 
tthe doors opened or broken down; the courtyards, the houses, the rooms, 
tinvaded; the men who are trying to escape and who protest and try to 
tsave themselves.
<b>

</b>ttOf course ... I was just going to work ...
<b> 
</b>
<b>89tBEN M'HIDI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAWN.
</b>
tBen M'Hidi is inside the hiding place. From outside, an old man helps 
thim to place the square piece of wall over the entrance, and then, in 
tthe spaces between the bricks, he adds a paste of plaster mixed with 
tcoal dust. When the paras arrive, everything is in order.

tStill men are being seized, beaten, dragged; a cache of weapons; men 
tpushed down the stairs:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSOLDIERS 
</b>ttGo on, go on, you little rats! Get to 
ttwork!


<b>90tCASBAH. STREETS. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
</b><b> 
</b>tWomen are clinging together after the beatings. 

tSomeone is fleeing toward the terraces. We hear the deafening whirl of 
tthe helicopters flying against the wind, their cabin doors open, paras 
tsitting on both sides with their legs dangling out, their machine guns 
ton their knees, a loudspeaker for every helicopter, microphones turned 
ton in such a way that the din of the motors is multiplied a hundred 
ttimes.
<b> 
</b>tThe helicopters fly low again, they skirt the terraces. 

tThe Algerians are fleeing in terror, the uproar begins to fade away, is 
tless intense; microphones are turned on, and off. The terraces are 
temptied, men seized, beaten, dragged; all the men are forced outside in 
tthe alleys, the streets, the squares, every man is forced to face the 
twall, his hands up.
<b> 
</b>
<b>91tSHOPS. DOORS UNHINGED. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
</b><b> 
</b> tA truck in reverse, a rope fastened to the hub of the wheels, its other 
tend to a door-latch. The motor is accelerated, clouds of exhaust 
tfumes ...

tDoor latches pried open like lids of sardine cans, shop windows smashed 
twith machine-gun butts, the counters, the shelves, flung into the air, 
tthe merchandise thrown into the streets; a game, a frenzied 
texcitement ...

tThe Algerians watch, but can not intervene. Some shopkeepers rush to 
tthe scene, crying despairingly, while others are dragged away forcibly, 
ttossed about, slapped, pushed, forced to open their shops.
<b> 
</b>
<b>92tCANDY SHOP. INSIDE. MORNING.
</b><b> 
</b> tA shopkeeper is pushed behind the counter; he gets up, trembling with 
tfear.
<b> 
</b>tA para asks him for a bag of candy, pays politely, smiles, pats his 
tbald head, and asks him sweetly:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPARA 
</b>ttAnd the strike, my friend?
<b> 
</b>tThen he distributes the candy among the children who are outside.
<b> 
</b>
<b>93tCANDY SHOP. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe children take the candy silently, without thanking him, then eat 
tthe candies slowly, their faces unfriendly and cold ...
<b> 
</b>
<b>94tPLACE DU GOUVERNEMENT. OUTSIDE. MORNING.

</b>tt"Attention, people of the Casbah! The NLF

ttPeople of the Casbah, show your love for

tAnd then Algerian music, a cheerful and rhythmical melody; the 
tAlgerians are forced out of the Casbah in columns, and are pushed 
ttoward the military trucks which clutter the southern side of the 
tsquare, and continue to arrive and depart.
<b> 
</b>
<b>95tCASBAH. EXIT. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
</b>
tMeanwhile the paras of the psychological divisions make their first 
tselection, randomly, or else deliberately, basing them on the slightest 
tsuspicions. They evaluate each man by his appearance or behavior. They 
tblock the Algerians from the exit ramp, and assault them with a battery 
tof questions: 

<b>ttttPARA'S VOICES
</b>ttWho are you? What's your name? Occupation? 
ttWhere do you work? Why did you strike?

ttyou belong to the NLF? C'mon, answer me! 
ttAre you afraid to say it? Never mind, it

</b>tThe Algerian does not answer, but stares into the para's eyes. The para 
tturns to his companions and shouts:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPARA 
</b>ttJacques! ... Jacques! ... Another one to

tThe Algerian is seized, and pushed toward the truck.

<b>ttttLOUDSPEAKER
</b>tt"Attention, Algerians! The NLF wants to

<b>96tTHE PORT. OUTSIDE. DAY. 
</b>
tThe port is deserted, the cranes still. A loaded ship sways lazily at 
ther moorings, the fork-lifts are filled with supplies ...

tThe limestone is dried out, the bridges empty, dangling cables swing 
tslowly from the pulleys. There is silence in the docks ...

 tThen, the sound of motors approaching, clouds of dust, Arabs pushed out 
tof the trucks, into the shipyard.
<b> 
</b>
<b>97tSTREETS OF ALGIERS. OUTSIDE. DAY. 
</b>
tIn the streets of the European city, there is an atmosphere of fear and 
tdoubt. The shop windows have their shutters lowered halfway, the 
tshopkeepers are standing in the doorways, ready to close.

tThe front doors of houses are shut. There are a few hurried passersby 
tbut no automobiles; the trams are not running; on the sidewalks the 
tgarbage is piled high, nearby the long brooms of the Algerian street 
tcleaners. 

<b>ttttPARAS
</b>ttt(yelling)
ttSweep, mes enfants, sweep.

tAn Algerian with a very refined expression, a gentle appearance, says, 
twhile excusing himself: 

<b>ttttALGERIAN 
</b>ttI don't know how, sir, I'm sorry ...

tThey shove the broom into his hands, and shout to him:

<b>ttttLOUDSPEAKER
</b>tt"French citizens! Europeans of Algiers! 
ttThe strike called by the NLF is a failure. 
ttDo not be afraid. Return to your jobs.

ttThe Army will protect you!"
<b> 
</b>
<b>98tSTREETS OF ALGIERS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tA jeep with loudspeaker precedes a row of military trucks loaded with 
tAlgerians.

tIn every truck there are two paras carrying machine guns by their 
tsides. The Algerians are standing crowded together one against the 
tother. Some of them are holding banners and signs:
<b> 
</b><b>ttI AM GOING TO WORK BECAUSE I AM FREE. 
</b>
<b>ttWE ARE FREE.
</b>
<b>ttARMY-POPULATION-PEACE. 
</b>
<b>ttTHE ARMY PROTECTS OUR RIGHTS.

 tThe trucks turn a corner, a youth jumps from the last truck, falls, 
tgets up again, and breaks into a run.

tThe paras shout to him to stop, their voices mix with that of the 
tloudspeaker.
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian continues to run.

tA burst of machine-gun fire, then another.

tThe Algerian jerks forward, his back curved, his arms raised.

</b>tThrough the open door, Mathieu can be seen passing, accompanied by

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttAnd you believe the NLF?

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttThe UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier

</b>ttIt is an armed insurrection ...

tThey have arrived at the second-floor landing, hurry along, and stop in 
tfront of a large door, where there is a written sign: PREFECT. Mathieu, 
tat the same time, has continued speaking.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttIt is an inevitable stage in revolutionary

tMathieu leans his hand on the door handle and smiles at the

<b>tttt1ST JOURNALIST 
</b>ttWhat's the problem then?

tMathieu gestures and makes an expression as if to say: "see what I 
tmean?" At the same time, he opens the door. But before entering, he 
tturns again to the journalists. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttWill you kindly explain to me why all the 
ttSartres are always born on the other side?

<b>tttt5TH JOURNALIST

<b>100tPLACE DU GOUVERNEMENT AND RUE DU DIVAN BLOCKADE. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
</b><b> 
</b>tPlace du Gouvernement, dusk, the other side of the blockade is silent, 
tonly the uncovered eyes of the Algerian women who await their men.
<b> 
</b>tThe trucks continue to arrive: the men are forced to descend and 
tallowed to enter the Casbah. There is an atmosphere of sadness, for not 
tall the men have returned. The women look at them, scrutinize their 
tfaces, from the first to the last in one glance, then slowly ... one 
tface at a time. Some women recognize their husbands, or their brothers 
tor their sons, and run to meet them ... 

tBut others continue to ask for news in lowered, sorrowful voices.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttAD-LIB VOICES 
</b>ttHave you seen Mohamed? Where? When? Why
tthasn't he returned?
<b> 
</b>tA steady hum of voices in Arabic; then the monotonous voice of a 
tpoliceman who speaks in the microphone of the loudspeaker.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttLOUDSPEAKER 
</b>tt"The NLF wants to stop you from working. 
ttThe NLF forces you to close your shops,

<b> 
</b>tThe loudspeaker is attached to one of the blockade posts, and from it a 
tlong wire for the microphone is hanging. The policeman has a raspy and 
tbored voice; he stops speaking and leans the microphone on the table in 
tfront of him. He gets up, lights a cigarette, and moves away a few 
tsteps.
<b> 
</b>tTwo children are among the women and behind the wooden horses 
tbarricades. They were waiting for this moment.
<b> 
</b>tThey bend, seem to be playing, but one of them lifts the barbed wire
 tas high as he can, from the ground. Petit Omar passes a wire 
tunderneath, its farthest end bent in the form of a hook. He moves it 
ttoward the microphone cord which is lying coiled on the ground. He 
tsucceeds in clasping it and pulls it toward him slowly. The cord  
tunwinds, lengthens, stretches, until the microphone on the table begins 
tto move, until it reaches the edge of the table, and falls ...

tThe noise re-echoes in the loudspeaker, but no one pays any attention 
tto it.
<b> 
</b>tPetit Omar waits a second, then begins to pull again. 

tThe microphone is dragged along the ground -- a humming sound -- it 
tmoves nearer, inch by inch, forward, under the barbed wire, until the 
tchildren are able to take it, and disappear with it behind the women.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttLOUDSPEAKER 
</b>tt"Algerians! Brothers! Do not be afraid! 
ttAlgeria will be free. Be courageous, 
ttbrothers! Resist! Do not listen to what 
ttthey are telling you ... Algeria will be

<b> 
</b>tThe voice is not violent, but gentle, somewhat breathless and hurried. 
tIt extends to the whole square, so that all can hear it well: the 
tpeople stop what they are doing to listen. They are emotional, proud, 
tor angry, and look toward the sky where the voice seems to be diffused, 
tas if those words should be written up above.

tThe officer is slow to realize what has happened, looks at the 
tloudspeaker, the cord, and now grabs it, cursing. He pulls and tugs it; 
tthe wire yields, and he wrenches it from the microphone.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttLOUDSPEAKER 
</b>tt"Brothers--" 

tThe voice is no longer heard, nothing more, silence. 

tSilence, only that something is changed in the women's eyes. The veils 
tthat cover the lower half of their faces suddenly begin to tremble, 
tsway as if shaken by a breath, a light wind. There is no longer an 
tatmosphere of sadness, or silence.
<b> 
</b><b>tJU-JU.

<b> 
</b>tThe other Algerians, about a hundred of them, are sitting on the 
tground, in the clearing in front of the house, and the paras of the 
tfirst regiment continue to guard them with pointed machine guns ...

tSuddenly from the villa, the music of a French song comes forth at full

tA para rushes through a corridor carrying a tape recorder, enters a 
troom where there are some sergeants and an Algerian.

tThe adjoining room with white tiled walls and a sink is visible through 
tan open door. Two paras are sitting on the floor, smoking and chatting 
tbetween themselves in whispers. 

tThe para places the tape recorder on the table. The Algerian is naked 
tto the waist. Signs of torture are visible. His face is swollen and 
twet. The sergeant places the chair near him, and helps him to sit down, 
tthen starts the tape recorder. He says to the Algerian who is 
ttrembling:

</b> tIn a room on the ground floor, a captain is bent over a large map with

tthe bottom of the pyramid ...
<b> 
</b>tAt the same time, paras are seen through the large window, bringing 
tother Algerians to the villa, and immediately afterward, the music and

</b>
<b>106tCASBAH STREET. OUTSIDE. DAY. RAIN. 
</b>
tA cloudy day, a light drizzle, a sloping street, Algerian music. A 
tcompany of zouaves walk two by two in the Casbah, through the alleys, 
tstop, play their music, and move on again, alternating Algerian music 
tand a French song.

tBehind them, a line of donkeys with baskets full of packages and bags, 
tand cheerful paras who are joking, as they distribute the supplies to 
tthe starving women and children, who stand ashamed in front of their
thouses, their eyes lowered, their gestures too brusque, and hesitant.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSPEAKER
</b>tt"At the General Assembly of the United 
ttNations, none of the motions presented in 
ttthe course of the debate has obtained the 
ttnecessary majority. At last an agreement 
tthas been reached on a resolution that 
ttexcludes any form of direct intervention 
ttby the UN in the Algerian question. The

ttitself to expressing the hope that in a 
ttspirit of cooperation, a peaceful, 
ttdemocratic, and just solution will be 
ttfound, that conforms to the principles of 
ttthe United Nations Charter ..."
<b> 
</b>tThe monotony of the last words is drowned out and lost. It is raining 
tmore heavily now. The water has begun to run along the sloping alleys. 
tThe walls are gray, wet; the doors of the cafes and shops are barred 
twith signs nailed upon them. 

<b>ttTHIS SHOP HAS SUPPORTED THE NLF STRIKE. 
</b><b>ttTHE PREFECT HAS ORDERED ITS CLOSING UNTIL 
</b><b>ttFURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. 
</b>
tThe band of zouaves has stopped again, and now they are playing "La vie 
ten rose."
<b> 
</b>
<b>107tVILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAWN.
</b><b> 
</b> tIn some parts of the villa a gramophone is playing "La vie en rose."
<b> 
</b>tIn the room on the first floor, through the large window, the whiteness 
tof the dawn is visible. The desk is cluttered with beer cans and 
tthermos. Mathieu and other officers have their eyes fixed on the graph, 
twhere the captain is marking other small crosses at the bottom of the 
tpyramid. The scene is motionless; their expressions are dull. Everyone 
tseems to be incapable of movement, overcome by the dull apathy that
talways follows a sleepless night.

tUntil Mathieu breaks the stillness of the scene. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU
</b>ttGood ... Good work ... Now we can all go 
ttto sleep. 

tAnd moving together with the others, he continues.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttThe end of the strike doesn't change 
ttanything. The directives remain the same. 
ttGive your men the usual shifts. We must 
ttremain in the Casbah: twenty-four hours a 
ttday! 

tHe turns and points to the graph. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttWe must cling to it, and work fast!

tThen he turns to the officers and smiling, says in another tone of 
tvoice:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttHave any of you ever had a tapeworm?
<b> 
</b>tThe officers say "no" and laugh.

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttThe tapeworm is a worm that can grow to 
ttinfinity. There are thousands of segments. 
ttYou can destroy all of them; but as long 
ttas the head remains, it reproduces itself 
ttimmediately. It is the same thing with the 
ttNLF. The head is the General Staff, four 
ttpersons. Until we are able to eliminate 
ttthem, we must always start again from the 
ttbeginning.

tWhile he is speaking, Mathieu takes his wallet from his back pocket, 
topens it, takes out four photos.

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttI found these in the police archives. 
ttThey are old shots, but I made some 
ttclose-ups. Ramel ... Si Mourad ... 
ttKader ... Ali la Pointe. We must print a 
ttthousand copies and distribute them to 
ttthe men.
<b> 
</b>tMeanwhile, the photos are passed around.

tThere are photos taken from identification cards, or blown up from some 
tgroup shots, figures somewhat blurred, faded, smiling, peaceful ...
<b> 
</b>
<b>108tNLF LEADERS' HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tIn the dim light, the four faces are barely illuminated. The shadows 
ttone down their expressions: Kader, Ali la Pointe, Ramel, Si Mourad. 
tThey are crowded into the hiding place, sitting on the floor, 
tmotionless, their eyes staring straight ahead, their breathing heavy. 
tFrom outside, noises, voices that are fading in the distance. Silence. 

tThen, a discreet knock, a remark in Arabic.
<b> 
</b>tThe four breathe deeply, look at each other, then smile a little.

tAli unslips the beam which, placed through an iron ring, is holding 
tshut the door of the hiding place. Using the soles of his feet, he 
tpushes against the square of wall: the light enters violently. It is 
tnot electric light, but daylight.
<b> 
</b>tKader blinks his eyes to accustom them to the light, then goes out on 
tall fours; after him, Ramel, and then the others. They leave the hiding 
tplace that Ali built in the wash-house on the terrace.
<b> 
</b>
<b>109tCOMPLEX OF KADER'S HOUSE. OUTSIDE. DAY. 
</b>
tAll of them have machine guns. Ramel is very tall and robust, about 
tthirty years old.
<b> 
</b>tSi Mourad is slightly older than Ramel. His movements are slow and 
tprecise; his glance expresses patience and authority. Djamila is 
twaiting for them.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDJAMILA 
</b>ttYou can come out. Thank God. There were so 
ttmany this time, about ten.

tAli recloses the hiding place.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttKADER 
</b>ttParatroopers? 

<b>ttttDJAMILA 
</b>ttYes.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttKADER 
</b>ttWhat do you think? Did they come here on 
ttpurpose or by accident?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDJAMILA 
</b>ttNo. By accident. They asked some questions, 
ttbut they didn't touch anyone.
<b> 
</b>tAli has come out of the wash-house. The sun is high, and helicopters 
tare seen passing one another in the sky. On some faraway terraces, 
tbivouacs of paras are visible. They are guarding the Casbah from above.
<b>t
</b>tThe rumble of motors and the voice of the loudspeaker are heard more 
tclearly as they near the house.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttLOUDSPEAKER

<b> 
</b> tThe voice fades away and is no longer heard. At the same time, a woman 
thas come up from the floor below, carrying a tray of cups and a teapot.

tAli looks at her quickly, but then watching her more closely, he sees 
tthat she is crying. When she passes near him, he stops her, places his 
thand kindly on her shoulder, and asks her in Arabic why she is crying.

tThe woman shakes her head, tries to smile, but says nothing. Then she 
tenters the wash-house silently and begins to serve the tea.

</b>ttIt's better to split up, to increase our

<b>110tMUNICIPAL STADIUM. OUTSIDE. DAY. FEBRUARY 10, 1957.
</b>
tThe municipal stadium is crowded with people. There is a football game 
tbetween two European teams. It is almost the end of the first half. 
tFrom above to the right of the guest box, there is a very loud 
texplosion.
<b> 
</b>tStrips of flesh are hurled into the air. Thick, white smoke ... There 
tare screams of terror. The people try to move away in haste. They are 
tshoving, pushing, bumping into one another ... Then, calm returns. The

<b> 
</b>
<b>111tPREFECT'S OFFICE. PRESS HALL. INSIDE. DAY. FEBRUARY 25.
</b><b> 
</b> tBen M'Hidi is standing in front of the journalists with handcuffs on 
this wrists and ankles. He is without a tie. He is smiling a little, his 
tglance ironical. There are two paras behind him with machine guns 
tready. The picture is still for an instant; Ben M'Hidi's smile is 
tsteady, so too his eyes, his entire face. Flashes, clicking of cameras.
<b> 
</b><b>tttt1ST JOURNALIST
</b>ttMr. Ben M'Hidi ... Don't you think it is 
tta bit cowardly to use your women's baskets 
ttand handbags to carry explosive devices 
ttthat kill so many innocent people?
<b> 
</b>tBen M'Hidi shrugs his shoulders in his usual manner and smiles a 
tlittle.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEN M'HIDI 
</b>ttAnd doesn't it seem to you even more 
ttcowardly to drop napalm bombs on unarmed 
ttvillages, so that there are a thousand 
tttimes more innocent victims? Of course, 
ttif we had your airplanes it would be a lot 
tteasier for us. Give us your bombers, and 
ttyou can have our baskets.

<b>tttt2ND JOURNALIST
</b>ttMr. Ben M'Hidi ... in your opinion, has 
ttthe NLF any chance to beat the French 
ttarmy?

<b>ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttIn my opinion, the NLF has more chances 
ttof beating the French army than the 
ttFrench have to stop history. 

tThe press hall in the prefect's office is crowded with journalists of 
tevery nationality. At the side and central aisles there are 
tphotographers and cameramen.
<b> 
</b>tBen M'Hidi is opposite them, standing on a low wooden platform. Mathieu 
tis next to him, seated behind a small desk. Mathieu now gets up, and 
tsignals to two paratroopers. Another journalist simultaneously has 
tasked another question:
<b> 
</b><b> tttt3RD JOURNALIST
</b>ttMr. Ben M'Hidi, Colonel Mathieu has said 
ttthat you have been arrested by accident, 
ttpractically by mistake. In fact, it seems 
ttthat the paratroopers were looking for 
ttsomeone much less important than yourself. 
ttCan you tell us why you were in that 
ttapartment at rue Debussy last night?
<b> 
</b>tThe two paras have moved forward and they take Ben M'Hidi by the arms. 
tAt the same time, he answers.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttI can only tell you that it would have 
ttbeen better if I had never been there ...
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttt(intervening)
ttThat's enough, gentlemen. It's late, and 
ttwe all have a lot of work ...
<b> 
</b>tBen M'Hidi glances at him ironically. 

<b>ttttBEN M'HIDI
</b>ttIs the show already over?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttYes, it's over ... before it becomes 
ttself-defeating.

tThe paras lead Ben M'Hidi away. He moves away with short steps, as much 
tas he can with the irons that are tightened around his ankles. Mathieu 
thas turned to the journalists and smiles again.
<b> 
</b>
<b>112tPREFECT'S OFFICE. PRESS HALL. INSIDE. DAY. MARCH 4. 
</b>
tColonel Mathieu is standing. On his face is a brief smile, motionless, 
this eyes attentive, but half-closed somewhat, due to the camera 
tflashes.
<b> 
</b><b> tttt1ST JOURNALIST
</b>ttColonel Mathieu ... the spokesman for the 
ttresiding minister, Mr. Gorlin, has stated 
ttthat "Larbi Ben M'Hidi committed suicide 
ttin his own cell, hanging himself with 
ttpieces of his shirt, that he had used to 
ttmake a rope, and then attached to the 
ttbars of his cell window." In a preceding 
ttstatement, the same spokesman had 
ttspecified that: "... due to the intention 
ttalready expressed by the prisoner Ben 
ttM'Hidi to escape at the first opportunity, 
ttit has been necessary to keep his hands 
ttand feet bound continually." In your 
ttopinion, colonel, in such conditions, is 
tta man capable of tearing his shirt, 
ttmaking a rope from it, and attaching it 
ttto a bar of the window to hang himself?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttYou should address that question to the 
ttminister's spokesman. I'm not the one who 
ttmade those statements ... On my part, I 
ttwill say that I had the opportunity to 
ttadmire the moral strength, intelligence, 
ttand unwavering idealism demonstrated by 
ttBen M'Hidi. For these reasons, although 
ttremembering the danger he represented, I 
ttdo not hesitate to pay homage to his 
ttmemory.
<b> 
</b><b>tt tt2ND JOURNALIST
</b>ttColonel Mathieu ... Much has been said 
ttlately not only of the successes 
ttobtained by the paratroopers, but also of 
ttthe methods that they have employed ... 
ttCan you tell us something about this? 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttThe successes obtained are the results 
ttof those methods. One presupposes the 
ttother and vice versa.
<b> 
</b><b>tttt3RD JOURNALIST 
</b>ttExcuse me, colonel. I have the impression 
ttthat perhaps due to excessive prudence ... 
ttmy colleagues continue to ask the same 
ttallusive questions, to which you can only 
ttrespond in an allusive manner. I think it 
ttwould be better to call things by their 
ttright names; if one means torture, then 
ttone should call it torture.

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttI understand. What's your question?

<b>tttt3RD JOURNALIST
</b>ttThe questions have already been asked. I 
ttwould only like some precise answers, 
ttthat's all ...
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttLet's try to be precise then. The word 
tt"torture" does not appear in our orders. 
ttWe have always spoken of interrogation as 
ttthe only valid method in a police 
ttoperation directed against unknown 
ttenemies. As for the NLF, they request 
ttthat their members, in the event of 
ttcapture, should maintain silence for 
tttwenty-four hours, and then, they may 
tttalk. Thus, the organization has already
 tthad the time necessary to render useless 
ttany information furnished ... What type 
ttof interrogation should we choose? ... 
ttthe one the courts use for a crime of 
tthomicide which drags on for months?
<b> 
</b><b> tttt3RD JOURNALIST
</b>ttThe law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttAnd those who explode bombs in public 
ttplaces, do they perhaps respect the law? 
ttWhen you asked that question to Ben 
ttM'Hidi, remember what he said? No, 
ttgentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious 
ttcircle. And we could discuss the problem 
ttfor hours without reaching any 
ttconclusions. Because the problem does 
ttnot lie here. The problem is: the NLF 
ttwants us to leave Algeria and we want to 
ttremain. Now, it seems to me that, despite 
ttvarying shades of opinion, you all agree 
ttthat we must remain. When the rebellion 
ttfirst began, there were not even shades 
ttof opinion. All the newspapers, even the 
ttleft-wing ones wanted the rebellion 
ttsuppressed. And we were sent here for 
ttthis very reason. And we are neither 
ttmadmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who 
ttcall us fascists today, forget the 
ttcontribution that many of us made to the 
ttResistance. Those who call us Nazis, do 
ttnot know that among us there are 
ttsurvivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We 
ttare soldiers and our only duty is to 
ttwin. Therefore, to be precise, I would 
ttnow like to ask you a question: Should 
ttFrance remain in Algeria? If you answer 
tt"yes," then you must accept all the 
ttnecessary consequences.

</b>tAll the inhabitants of a house. The men are in a row on the balcony of 
tthe first floor, their hands crossed behind their heads, their backs to 
tthe wall, while paras guard them with pointed machine guns.

tTwo paratroopers lead an Algerian girl forward: she seems to be 
texhausted, and can barely walk, her eyes half-closed. 

tThey stop in front of the first man and ask her:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttPARAS 
</b>ttIs this one?

<b>ttttSPEAKER
</b>tt"Our hearts are breaking before such 
ttoutrages, our houses invaded, our 
ttfamilies massacred. Brothers, rebel! 
ttBring terror to the European city!"
<b> 
</b>
<b>123tALGERIAN STREETS. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe European city, evening, houses are being lit. People have finished 
tworking. They are going to the bars, cinemas, or for walks, or crowding 
tthe bus stops ...
<b> 
</b>tThe wail of a siren at full blast, an ambulance, driven at frightening 
tspeed.
<b> 
</b>tThe people move aside, jump to the sidewalks. The cars squeeze to the 
tright, stop.
<b> 
</b>tThe ambulance door is opened, a corpse is thrown out, falls, rolls into 
tthe street.
<b> 
</b>tThe people rush to it. It is a hospital attendant's in white uniform 
twith a knife stuck in his throat.
<b> 
</b>tThe sound of the siren decreases in intensity; the ambulance is by now 
tfar away.
<b> 
</b>
<b>124 tAMBULANCE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. EVENING. 
</b>
tIn the driver's cab, there are two Algerian boys. Their hair is curly, 
ttheir shirts old and torn. They are sweating; their eyes wide open, 
tstaring.
<b> 
</b>tThe one who is driving barely reaches the height of the steering wheel. 
tHe clutches it desperately. The other has a machine gun. He makes a 
tremark in Arabic shouting to be heard above the siren.

tThe driver takes a hand off the steering wheel, places it on the 
tdashboard, and tries all the switches until he finds the one for the 
theadlights. The high beams.
<b> 
</b>tThe other, meanwhile, is now on his knees on the seat. He is leaning 
tout the open window to his waist, and he begins to shoot.


<b>125tROUTE OF AMBULANCE. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe pictures succeed one another in a dizzy rhythm; surprise, terror, 
tsomeone falls. 

<b>tSHOTS. SIREN.
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>126tAMBULANCE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. EVENING.
</b><b> 
</b>tThere is no more ammunition. The machine gun is thrown in the back of 
tthe ambulance. The siren is still at full blast. The auto races ahead 
tat terrifying speed. The two boys don't know any more what to do, where 
tto go, and the one who is driving has his eyes almost closed, as if he 
twere dizzy. 

tThey reach a square. 

<b>tSIREN.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe other points ahead to the left.
<b> 
</b>
<b>127tBUS SHELTER. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe people are crowded in a bus shelter. The one who is driving doesn't 
tunderstand or doesn't want to.

tThe other shouts to him again and again, the same phrase, then flings 
thimself on the steering wheel, and turns it in that direction.
<b> 
</b>tThe bus shelter is nearer and nearer.
<b> 
</b>tThe people are paralyzed. They have no time to move. They are run down, 
trammed into. The ambulance crashes into a pillar.

tOn the ground, all about, the bodies of dead and wounded. The boys' 
tbodies remain motionless, their foreheads resting on the smashed 
twindshield.
<b> 
</b>tBut the sound of the siren does not stop, and is heard, mournful and 
tfull of anguish.
<b> 
</b>
<b>128tRAMEL'S HOUSE. IMPASSE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL. 
</b><b>tOUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. AUGUST 26.
</b><b> 
</b>tImpasse St. Vincent-de-Paul, noon. There are helicopters in the sky, 
tand paras fill the alley.
<b> 
</b>tTheir faces are pale and tense, their eyes wide open, their hands 
tclutch their machine guns. There is a strange silence. Then a movement 
tat the back of the alley, a voice, a brief greeting. Mathieu has 
tarrived and he is saying to an officer:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttNow is not the time for heroes. Give me 
ttthe megaphone. 

tMathieu takes the megaphone in his hands and approaches an open door. 
tThrough the doorway the inner courtyard of the house is visible where 
tthe corpses of four paras are strewn about.
<b> 
</b>tRamel and Si Mourad are on the first-floor balcony, lying in wait 
tbehind the railings, so they are able to watch the door, courtyard, and 
tthe stairway that leads from the balcony to the terrace.

tOn the terrace there are other paras who are facing the balcony. From 
ttime to time they release a burst of machine gun fire.

tThe voice of Mathieu is heard over the loudspeaker.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttRamel ... Si Mourad ... use your heads. 
ttIf you go on like this, I wouldn't want to 
ttbe in your place when you are captured ... 
ttBecause you will be captured in the end, 
ttand you know it too. Surrender! If you do 
ttit immediately, I promise that you will 
ttnot be harmed and you will have a fair 
tttrial. Can you hear me?
<b> 
</b>tRamel and Si Mourad look at each other.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMOURAD
</b>ttWho is speaking?

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttMathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMOURAD
</b>ttWe don't trust you, colonel. Come 
ttforward, show yourself.
<b> 
</b>tA moment of silence.

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttI don't trust you either. First stand up 
ttso I can see you, and keep your hands 
ttstill and well in sight.

tMourad hesitates an instant, glances at Ramel, then: 

<b> ttttMOURAD
</b>ttOkay. But we want your promise for a fair 
tttrial in writing. Give us a written 
ttstatement, Mathieu, and then we'll 
ttsurrender. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttHow can I give you this statement? 

<b>ttttMOURAD
</b>ttWe'll lower a basket from the window ...

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttOkay, I'll make the statement in 
ttwriting ...

tMourad shows his companion the two large time-bombs that are on the 
tfloor in front of him. He takes one, begins to prepare it, and 
tregulates the mechanism.

tAt the same time, he tells Ramel in Arabic to go find the basket.
<b> 
</b>tRamel crawls past the doors which are all closed, and asks for a basket.

tA door opens and an old woman appears. She hands him a basket with its 
tcord rolled up.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMOURAD
</b>ttt(without turning around)
ttA newspaper too, or a piece of paper ...
<b> 
</b>tRamel brings him the basket and newspaper. Mourad has loaded the time-
tbomb mechanism, and the tic-toc sound is sharp and clear.

tNow he has to move the second hand. Mourad's hands do not tremble, his 
tglance is attentive, concentrating. Ramel watches him without saying a 
tword; his fear is obvious. 

tWithout moving, his eyes glued to the bomb dial:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMOURAD
</b>ttt(loudly)
ttAre you ready, colonel?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttYes ... But let me first see you.

tMourad moves one of the clock hands to precede the other one by a 
tminute. Immediately afterward he places the flat and rectangular bomb 
tin the bottom of the basket.
<b> 
</b>tThe basket seems to be empty. The piece of newspaper protects its 
tbottom. Mourad tells Ramel to get up, and he too gets up. Their machine 
tguns are lying on the ground. Meanwhile, Mourad has begun to count to 
thimself silently, his lips moving: one, two, three, four ... 

tFrom the terrace, the paras can see Ramel and Mourad standing up not 
tvery far away, their empty hands resting near the basket on the 
trailing. 

tA para shouts:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttPARA 
</b>ttWe see them. You can come.
<b> 
</b>tMourad begins to lower the basket very slowly.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMOURAD 
</b>ttt(counting)
<b>tt60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53 ...
</b>
tMathieu enters the courtyard together with an officer and other paras. 
tHe looks up toward the balcony, smiles, and shows them a folded piece 
tof paper.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttHere it is ... you know that when I give 
ttmy word, I keep it ...
<b> 
</b>tMourad does not answer, but looks at Mathieu as if to calculate the 
tdistance and time, and slows down even more the basket's descent.

tMathieu moves forward a few steps, as if to go for the basket that is 
thanging on the other side of the courtyard, but suddenly he seems 
tperplexed for a second, and then changes his mind. He turns to the 
tnearest para, and gives him the note.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU
</b>ttYou go ...

tMourad's face has remained motionless. In his expression there is a 
tshade of disappointment. He sees Mathieu retrace his steps toward the 
tdoor, and is now surrounded by a group of paratroopers ...

<b>ttttMOURAD 
</b>ttt(counting) 
<b>tt25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19 ...
</b>
tThe basket has stopped moving two yards from the ground. In order to 
treach it, the para has to step over the corpses of his dead companions, 
this face hardens, he reaches the basket, and extending his arm, he 
tthrows in the note. The basket does not move; the para looks up.

<b>ttttPARA 
</b>ttt(muttering)
ttHurry up, black bastard!
<b> 
</b>tMourad smiles at him, and mumbles something in Arabic, a phrase that he 
tdoesn't manage to finish, for now is heard -- the explosion.
<b> 
</b>
<b>129tRUE CATON 4. FATHIA'S HOUSE. INSIDE. NIGHT. SEPTEMBER 2.
</b>
tRue Caton number four. It is 11 p.m. A large, badly lit room is filled 
twith paratroopers and one of them is now being carried away on a 
tstretcher. Another three or four wounded are seated on the opposite 
tside of the room and are waiting their turn to be carried away.

tTwo paras are by the door. They look out from time to time, and are 
tattentive, ready, with machine guns clutched by their sides.
<b> 
</b>tOn the other side of the room opposite the door, the Algerians who live 
tin the house are standing against the wall. Mathieu is in front of 
tthem, and he is asking a group of women:

<b>ttttMATHIEU
</b>ttWhich one of you is Fathia?

tA woman about forty years old raises her eyes toward him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU
</b>ttIs it you?

tThe woman nods yes.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttGo up the stairs, and tell Kader that if 
ttthey don't surrender, we'll blow up 
tteverything ... Do you understand? 

tThe woman again nods yes, and without waiting for more words, she moves 
ttoward the door, taciturn, silent. Mathieu follows her, he pushes past 
ther.

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttTry to convince him, if you care about 
ttyour house ... Wait a minute ... Do you 
ttwant to get killed? 

tHe leans out the door and says loudly:
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttKader, look. Fathia is coming ... I 
ttwouldn't shoot ...
<b> 
</b>tThen he steps aside and lets the woman pass.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttGo on ...
<b> 
</b>tOutside the door, there is a small landing, then a steep stairway, and 
tat the top, a corridor. Fathia climbs the stairs that are cluttered 
twith empty magazines, with cartridge boxes. The walls are chipped from 
tthe shooting. The ceiling is parallel to the stairway at the same 
tinclination, for part of its distance. But for the last few yards, it 
tstraightens out and lowers to become horizontal.

tThe floor of the hiding place is open. Inside are Zohra and Kader.

tFathia repeats to them in Arabic what Mathieu has said to her.

tKader listens to her then answers, he too in Arabic. Then he smiles.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttOkay ... You can tell the colonel to blow 
ttup whatever he likes. Go on, now.
<b> 
</b>tFathia goes down the stairs, and reenters the room.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttFATHIA 
</b>ttt(to Mathieu)
ttHe said that you can blow up whatever 
ttyou like ...

tShe, then, rejoins the other women.

tMathieu seems to be tired, he has lost weight, he is nervous. He turns 
tto his men, and slowly as he gives the orders, the paras begin to move.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttReturn to where the others are. Prepare 
ttthe plastic. It should be placed on the 
ttceiling of the stairway under the hiding 
ttplace ... a long fuse rolled up ... Take 
ttcover ... keep shooting while you are 
ttworking. Quickly! Clear the house ... 
ttBring them outside, then check the rooms 
ttagain ... Hurry up!
<b> 
</b>tKader gives Zohra a box of matches. She goes to the back of the hiding 
tplace where there is a bundle of papers. She lights them, then returns 
tnear to Kader who is inspecting the magazine of his machine gun.

tThere are only two shots left. The other empty magazines are scattered 
taround. Kader turns to Zohra, and starts to speak, but suddenly his 
twords are blurred by the sound of shots. 

tKader and Zohra have to step back a little, because the shells are 
tflashing at the edge of the opening.
<b> 
</b>tThe shooting stops. From the stairway, one end of a long fuse is 
tthrown into the corridor. The other end is inserted into a plastic 
tcharge fastened to the ceiling of the stairway, under the hiding place.
<b> 
</b>tKader and Zohra can see two or three yards in front of them, below, 
tinto the corridor, where the end of the fuse is glowing and burning.

tKader too has lost weight, his beard is long. He looks at the fuse, 
tthen at Zohra. A second passes in silence. Now Zohra too looks at him, 
tand Kader says calmly in his usual voice:

<b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttIt doesn't do any good to die like this ... 
ttit doesn't help anybody ...

tHe leans out from the hiding place.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttt(shouting)
ttMathieu! If you give your word that you 
ttwon't touch any of the other people in 
ttthe house, we'll come out.
<b> 
</b>
<b>130tMILITARY CAR. INSIDE. NIGHT. 
</b>
tInside a military automobile.

tIn the back seat, Mathieu is sitting next to Kader who is handcuffed.
<b> 
</b>tZohra is in the front seat, between the driver and a para who has in 
this hand a large regulation pistol. The interior is lighted by the 
theadlights of a jeep which is following directly behind the auto a few 
tyards. Silence. Mathieu looks hastily at Kader, who is staring straight 
tin front of him, and appears to be sullen and downcast.

tThen Mathieu speaks in a pleasant tone, as if in friendly conversation.

<b>ttttMATHIEU
</b>ttIf you had let me blow you up, you would 
tthave disappointed me ...

tKader turns to him, and replies, trying to maintain his own voice at 
tthe same level of indifference:
<b>t 
</b><b>ttttKADER
</b>ttWhy?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttFor many months, I've had your photo on 
ttmy desk together with a dozen or so 
ttreports on you ... And naturally, I am 
ttunder the illusion that I know you 
ttsomewhat. You never seemed the type, 
ttKader, inclined to performing useless 
ttactions. 

tKader doesn't answer right away, then speaks slowly as if expressing 
tthe results of his doubts, a new point of view ...
<b> 
</b><b> ttttKADER 
</b>ttYou seem to be very satisfied to have 
tttaken me alive ...
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttOf course I am.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttThat proves that I was wrong. Evidently I 
ttcredited you with an advantage greater 
ttthan I should have.

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttNo. Let's just say that you've given me 
ttthe satisfaction to have guessed 
ttcorrectly. But from the technical point 
ttof view, it isn't possible to speak of 
ttadvantages. By now the game is over. The 
ttNLF has been defeated.

tZohra has turned around suddenly. She is crying and speaks hastily in 
tArabic, violently, harshly.

tMathieu doesn't understand, and turns to Kader to ask him politely, 
talthough with a bit of irony:

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttWhat is she saying?

<b>ttttKADER 
</b>ttShe says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
<b> 
</b>
<b>131tCROWDED BEACH. OUTSIDE. DAY. 
</b>
tAli la Pointe's glance is sullen, heavy, motionless. He moves his head 
tslowly in such a way so that his glance also moves in a semicircle.

tWhite beach, fine sand, transparent sea, bodies stretched out in the 
tsun, golden skin of girls; girls in bikinis, sensual, smiling, young 
tmen with narrow hips, with muscles well cared for, cheerful youth, 
tnaturally happy, enviable. The children are building sand castles near 
tthe water's edge; the beach is shaped like a half-moon with rocky reefs 
tat both ends ...
<b> 
</b>tA September Sunday, warm and calm. Ali is leaning on the wall. He is 
twearing a white wool cloak. Only his eyes are visible ... the eyes of a
 thungry tiger perched above a path, on the lookout for innocent prey. 
tEyes that now gleam, cruel eyes, tension dilating the pupils ... Then
tagain the calm, a gloomy calm, a gratifying tension. The place is 
tright, and the victims couldn't be better ones.

tAli moves, leaves the wall, crosses the street to a large city 
tsanitation truck, one of those metallic trucks with no visible 
topenings.

tA young Algerian is at the steering wheel, a street cleaner. He is 
tleaning his thin face on the wheel. His hands are dirty, by now 
tunwashable from years of work.

tAli has climbed into the cab. The truck is in motion and leaves.
<b> 
</b>
<b>132tSANITATION TRUCK. INSIDE. DAY.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe name of the street cleaner is Sadek. He seems frightened. He looks 
taround, hesitates before speaking.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttSADEK
</b>ttThen the beach is okay, Ali.

tSilence. Sadek looks at him again, waiting, but Ali does not respond.

 tAli looks straight ahead at the street bathed in sunlight, the tar that 
tseems to be liquid, the villas that surround Algiers, the lemon trees, 
tthe oleanders ... Then he speaks, but without turning to Sadek. He 
tspeaks in a whisper, his eyes continually staring straight ahead. 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttWe need two more, the biggest ones.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttSADEK
</b>ttAnd the others?

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttThe others ... let's wait and see. 

tSadek remains silent for a while.

<b> ttttSADEK
</b>ttI've looked, Ali, even where I work. 
ttNothing. The ones who have not been 
ttarrested have left Algiers and gone into 
ttthe mountains ... And the others don't 
ttwant to hear any more about it ... 
ttthey're afraid ...
<b>    
</b>tAli doesn't answer him. Silence.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttCan't you go any faster?
<b> 
</b><b> ttttSADEK
</b>ttYes, sure ... here.

tSadek puts the truck in third gear, accelerates the motor, then shifts 
tback again into fourth gear. The truck increases its speed. The road is 
tstraight, the outskirts of Algiers are visible.

<b> ttttSADEK
</b>ttIf we don't find any others ... should we 
ttcall it off? 

tAli turns suddenly to look at him but says nothing. Sadek can feel 
tthose eyes on him, and tries to justify himself.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttSADEK
</b>ttWe can't plant all of them by 
ttourselves ... 

tAli speaks to him in a dry and indifferent voice. 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttYou don't have to plant anything. You 
ttonly have to carry them, that's all.
<b> 
</b>
<b>133tRUE DES ABDERAMES. ALI'S HOUSE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. NIGHT.
</b><b> 
</b>tNight. At number three rue des Abderames, on the first-floor balcony, 
tthe stove fires are glowing. The women are cooking outside on their 
tstoves built from tin containers. They are cooking in front of the 
tdoors of their homes. The doorways are lit up.

tAli passes along the balcony, passes by Mahmoud and his wife who are 
tspeaking in whispers by themselves and leaning on the railing. It is a 
twarm and starry night. Mahmoud says some more words to his wife, still 
tspeaking in whispers, tenderly. Then he follows Ali who has stopped in 
tfront of the door.
<b> 
</b>
<b>134tALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. NIGHT.
</b><b> 
</b>tIn the room, there is Petit Omar who is cutting out some pictures from 
ta comic book.
<b> 
</b>tAs soon as he sees Ali at the door, he stops, closes his book, puts the 
tscissors in his pocket. He seems to be embarrassed at being caught in 
this childish game.
<b> 
</b>tIn the center of the room, there is a dividing curtain, pulled halfway 
tto the side. On the other side, Hassiba is typing. Behind Hassiba, next 
tto the bed, the hiding place is open. Ali enters. He seems tired, 
tsweating. He removes his cloak, tosses it on the chair, and puts his 
tmachine gun on the table.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttt(turning to Petit Omar)
ttC'mon, hurry. Go to sleep. Tomorrow we 
ttfour have a lot of work to do: Mahmoud, 
ttHassiba, you and I.
<b> 
</b>tMahmoud has remained motionless at the door. Hassiba has stopped typing 
tand approaches them. Omar says nothing, but there is a satisfied look 
tin his eyes. He can't help stretching out his hand to touch the machine 
tgun.
<b> 
</b>tAli sits down, at the table, moves the machine gun away from Omar, and 
tcontinues to speak, still talking to Omar.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttALI 
</b>ttBecause we can't find anyone else, Sadek 
ttwill bring us there in the truck. You get 
ttout first and plant the bomb where I tell 
ttyou ... then return here quickly. But be 
ttcareful that no one is following you. Then 
ttHassiba will get out, and after her, 
ttMahmoud. Then I will plant the ones that 
ttare left. They'll know that we're still
ttstrong ... you can be sure of that.
<b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>135tALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN. OCTOBER 7, 1957.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe room is badly lit by a small lamp which is on the other side of the 
tcurtain. There is a mattress on the table and Petit Omar is lying on 
ttop, asleep.
<b> 
</b>tAli is lying on a mattress on the ground, fully dressed, with his 
tmachine gun by his side. His eyes are open, and he is listening to the 
tfar-away sound of a motor. He looks at his watch, gets up, and goes to 
topen the door. Outside there is the first gray light of dawn. The sound 
tis heard more clearly and seems to be moving nearer.
<b> 
</b>tAli returns to Petit Omar, stays a minute looking at him, then shakes 
thim roughly. The child gets up immediately. He is trembling, as if he 
thad slept with taut nerves, and jumps down quickly from the table. His 
teyes are open, but he is still sleepy.

tAli smiles for a moment, and runs his fingers through Omar's hair.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttALI 
</b>ttOmar, Omar. C'mon, wake up. Hurry, little 
ttone. Today you're going to see fireworks.

tThe child also smiles and his face relaxes, then brightens up. At the 
tsame time, he extends his hand and pats Ali's side. Mahmoud enters the 
troom from the balcony. He is carrying a tray with four cups of coffee. 

<b>ttttMAHMOUD
</b>ttIt's almost time, isn't it? 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttYes.
<b> 
</b> tThen Ali turns to the curtain and calls:
<b> 
</b><b> ttttALI 
</b>ttHassiba ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttHASSIBA
</b>ttI'm ready.
<b> 
</b>tAli sits down and puts on a pair of sneakers. Petit Omar has finished 
tdressing.
<b>      
</b>tThe curtain is drawn, Hassiba appears, already dressed. 

<b>ttttMAHMOUD
</b>ttI heard the sound of a truck before ...
<b> 
</b><b> ttttALI 
</b>ttMe too. But I don't think it was Sadek. 
ttOtherwise he'd be here by now.

tHassiba is dressed in European clothes, a skirt and blouse. She nears 
tthe table and takes a cup of coffee. 

<b>ttttHASSIBA 
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttHow is your wife now?
<b>      
</b>tMahmoud's face is expressionless. He shakes his head.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMAHMOUD
</b>ttSo-so ... 

tAli has finished putting on his shoes. He takes a cup of coffee. In the 
tsame moment, outside the door is heard: 

<b>tMACHINE-GUN FIRE. 
</b>
tThe four are startled. 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttt(shouting)
ttInside! Inside!
<b> 
</b>tSimultaneously, all of them move toward the hiding place. 

tMahmoud's wife appears at the door. Her face is despairing, but she 
tmoves carefully, quickly, precisely. She closes the door. She puts the 
tcoffee cups back on the tray, and hides everything in the sink.
<b> 
</b>tShe goes to the other side of the curtain. Ali is entering the hiding 
tplace. The other three are already inside. Ali pushes the movable piece 
tof wall toward him, and the woman helps him.

tThen, she takes a can from the night table; it is full of plaster mixed 
twith coal dust. The woman spreads the paste in the joints between the 
tbricks of the wall and the closure of the hiding place. At the same 
ttime, shouting, shots, and the footsteps of paras are heard.

tAs soon as she has finished, the woman slips into bed under the sheets.

tThe paratroopers break into the room shouting, and make the woman get 
tup. They drag her outside on the balcony.
<b> 
</b>
<b>136 tABDERAMES COURTYARD. OUTSIDE. DAWN.
</b><b> 
</b>tThey drag Mahmoud's wife down from the balcony to the center of the 
tcourtyard, where now all the inhabitants of the building are standing 
t-- men, women, children -- all of them with their hands to the wall, in 
tfull sight of the paras who are guarding them.

tSadek's head is lowered. He passes along the balcony between Marc and 
tthe captain. He stops in front of the door.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttt(mumbling softly)
ttHere?
<b> 
</b>tThe Algerian nods yes. They enter.
<b> 
</b>
<b>137tALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN.

</b> tSadek points toward the curtain. The captain signals him to go there. 
tThe Algerian points to a spot in the brick baseboard.

tThe captain examines it and with his thumb, he tests the fresh plaster. 
tHe bends down and leans his ear to the wall. He smiles as he listens to 
tthe ...

<b>tHEAVY BREATHING.
</b><b> 
</b>tIt is the same breathing that soon after Mathieu hears, bent in the 
tsame position as the captain. The colonel gets up and looks around him.
<b> 
</b>tFour paras are ready with their machine guns aimed at the hiding place. 
tOthers are arranging plastic charges along the wall, all of them 
tconnected to a single fuse.
<b> 
</b>tIn a corner, Sadek, wearing his cap and army camouflage fatigues, is 
tsitting on a chair.

tHe is watching the scene with his eyes wide open. He is trembling. His 
tbody is slouched forward. He seems to be lifeless, without nerves. If 
tit weren't for his face, he would seem to be a heap of rags.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttt(to the captain)
ttEverything ready?
<b> 
</b><b> ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttYes, sir.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttHe hasn't answered?
<b> 
</b><b> ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttNo, sir. Total silence. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttI thought so. It was obvious.
<b> 
</b>tMathieu bends down again and leans his ear against the bricks. He gets 
tup again. He remains a minute in this position, lost in thought.

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttt(loudly and markedly)
ttAli ... Ali la Pointe ... You're going to 
ttbe blown up. Let the others come out, at 
ttleast the child. We'll let him off with 
ttreformatory school ... Why do you want to 
ttmake him die?

tMathieu stops, and shakes his head. He turns to the captain: 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttLet's go ...

tA paratrooper is unrolling a large bundle of fuse. 

<b>ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttBring it down there, till it reaches 
ttoutside ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPARA 
</b>ttYes, sir ...

tMathieu has stopped in front of Sadek. He looks at him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttIs this one still here? ... Take him away. 

tTwo paratroopers grab the street cleaner by the armpits and almost 
tlifting him completely, they lead him away. Mathieu is about to go out, 
tthen turns and takes the megaphone from the captain's hands, and places 
tit to his mouth. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttAli! Ali la Pointe! I am giving you 
ttanother thirty seconds. What do you hope 
ttto gain? You've lost anyway. Thirty 
ttseconds, Ali, starting now.
<b> 
</b>
<b>138tALI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAWN.
</b><b> 
</b> tAli la Pointe's eyes are staring at the square piece of wall that seals 
tthe hiding place. His glance is taciturn, gloomy. The others are 
twatching Ali. Their lips are half-open, their breasts rise and fall in
 tlaborious breathing.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttALI 
</b>ttt(in deep, resigned voice) 
ttWho wants to leave?
<b> 
</b>tPetit Omar presses against Ali's arm; he looks like a son with his 
tfather.
<b> 
</b>tMahmoud takes his head in his hands and squeezes it.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttHASSIBA
</b>ttWhat are you going to do? 

<b>ttttALI 
</b>ttI don't deal with them.
<b> 
</b>
<b>139tALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN.
</b><b> 
</b> tMathieu checks his watch; thirty seconds have passed. He moves to go 
tout. The four paras with machine guns are still in the room.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttt(to another paratrooper)
ttYou stay here by the door to signal the 
ttothers. When I call you, all of you come 
ttdown ...
<b> 
</b>
<b>140tRUE DES ABDERAMES. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
</b><b> 
</b> tThe sun has risen to the height of the terraces. 

tThe terraces are swarming with people.
<b> 
</b>tThe alley is empty and only the fuse is visible; it reaches to a small
tclearing full of paratroopers. Two more colonels and a general have 
tarrived.
<b> 
</b>tThere is a paratrooper with an "Arriflex" ready to film the explosion.
<b> 
</b>tThe atmosphere is that of a show. Two paratroopers are connecting the 
tends of the fuse to the electric contact.
<b> 
</b>tOn the terraces, there are Algerian women, children, and old people.

tTheir eyes are motionless; someone is praying. There is an atmosphere 
tof suspense.
<b> 
</b>tThere is also the wife of Mahmoud; her eyes seem blank. 

tFive paras come out of the house quickly, and pass along the alley 
ttoward the clearing.

tThe captain signals, and the para begins to lower the contact switch 
tslowly.
<b> 
</b>tThe eyes of all are motionless. The camera is ready. But the explosion 
tdoes not occur.
<b>      
</b>tThe paratrooper swears; he examines the wires.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttCAPTAIN 
</b>ttStand back! Ready, Pierre?
<b> 
</b> tPierre responds by mumbling something, and at the same time his hands 
tare moving frenziedly around the wires.
<b> 
</b>
<b>141tALI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. MORNING.
</b><b> 
</b> tAli la Pointe bends over Petit Omar as if to cover him. Hassiba has 
tstopped breathing, her eyes wide open; Mahmoud is crying ...

tA single image, a second and now: 

<b>tTHE EXPLOSION.
</b><b> 
</b>
<b>142 tRUE DES ABDERAMES. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
</b><b> 
</b>tThe house collapses in a white cloud, as if its foundations had 
tsuddenly been removed.
<b> 
</b>tMathieu and the other officers move away. Behind them the echo of the 
texplosion continues to resound, then shouts, orders, and isolated 
tju-ju.
<b> 
</b>tMathieu's face is weary but his expression is relieved. He is smiling.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGENERAL
</b>ttAnd so the tapeworm no longer has a head. 
ttAre you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers 
tteverything should be over.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttYes, I believe there won't be any more 
tttalk of the NLF for some time.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGENERAL
</b>ttLet's hope forever. 

tAnother colonel intervenes:
<b> 
</b><b> tttt1ST COLONEL
</b>ttAt heart they are good people. We've had 
ttgood relations with them for a hundred and 
ttthirty years ... I don't see why we 
ttshouldn't continue that way.

<b>tttt2ND COLONEL
</b>ttYes, but Algiers is not the only city in 
ttAlgeria. 

<b>ttttMATHIEU 
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttBah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the 
ttonly country in the world ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttGENERAL 
</b>ttt(smiling)
ttWhy, yes, of course ... But for the 
ttmoment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! 
ttIn the mountains our work is always 
tteasier.
<b> 
</b>tGradually the officers move away down the slanting street toward their 
tjeeps, and their remarks fade away and are lost.

<b>143tCASBAH STREETS. DEMONSTRATIONS. OUTSIDE. DAY. DECEMBER 1960.
</b><b> 
</b>tLike the cries of birds, of thousands of wild birds, the ju-jus invade 
tand shake the black sky. 

<b>tJU-JU-JU ...
</b>
tAnd below, in the Casbah the white cloaks of the Algerians are like 
tstreams, floods; through the alleys, down the stairways, through the 
tstreets and the squares, they flow toward the European city.
<b> 
</b>
<b>144tPRESS HALL. PREFECT'S OFFICE. INSIDE. DAY.

</b> tIn the press hall, the journalists are taking the telephones by force, 
tshouting at the top of their voices. An English journalist:

</b>ttNo one knows what could have been the

ttunleashed without warning ... I telephoned

</b> tThe paratroopers jump down from the trucks, and rush forward.

tThe policemen rush forward, soldiers, zouaves, the CRS ...

tDeployed in cordons, in a wedge, in turtle-like formations, in order to 
tdivide, to scatter, to hold back ...

tBut the demonstrators will not move back, or divide. They continue to 
tpress forward, pushing against the troops, face to face.

<b> 
</b>tThe Europeans are closing their doors, lowering shutters. They too, the 
tyounger ones, the more decisive, are grouping together, trying to 
tconfront the Algerians. They are less numerous, but armed ...

tThe first revolver shots resound in the streets, from the windows. Some 
tAlgerians fall, but the others continue to advance. They are running 
tnow, scattering.
