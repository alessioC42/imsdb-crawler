tDARKNESS.  As the MAIN TITLES BEGIN, the theater thrums with
ta subsonic HISS which mounts in all the rattling power of
tTHX, and we...

<b>tBURN IN, BRIGHT LIVING COLOR:
</b>
<b>tEXT. STRATOSPHERE - DAY
</b>
tThe glory of stratospheric dawn.  The engines of a silver
tLockheed U-2F rasp upon the trace oxygen here at 72,500 feet. 
tScattered cloud formations hang over the blue brilliance of
tsea far, far below.  In the haze, the looming edge of land.

<b>tSUPER: FLIGHT G-3101. OCTOBER 14TH, 1962. OVER CUBA.
</b>
tThe spy plane's CAMERA DOORS whine open.  The glassy eye of
tthe 36-inch camera focuses.  And then with a
tBANGBANGBANGBANG, its high-speed motor kicks in, shutter
tflying.

<b>tttttttMATCH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
tA simple CAMERA, snapping away furiously in the hands of a
tgiggling MARK O'DONNELL, 4.  He's straddling and in the face
tof his dad, KENNY O'DONNELL, 30's, tough, Boston-Irish, with
ta prodigious case of morning hair.  Kenny awakens, red-eyed.

<b>ttttHELEN (O.S.)
</b>ttMark, get off your father!

tKenny sits up to the morning bedlam of the O'Donnell house.

tKIDS screech, doors bang all over.  Kenny pushes Mark over,
trolls out of bed, snatches up the corners of the blanket and
thoists Mark over his shoulder in a screaming, kicking bundle.

<b>tINT. O'DONNELL HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tKenny, with Mark in the bundle on his shoulder, meets his
twife HELEN going the other way in the hall with LITTLE HELEN,
t1, in her arms.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttHi, hon.

tThey kiss in passing.  Daughter KATHY, 12, races by in angry
tpursuit of her twin, KEVIN, 12.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttDon't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk
ttto you this afternoon about Kevin.  You
ttneed to do something about this.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttKids are supposed to get detention.

tKenny dumps the bundle with Mark in a big pile of dirty
tlaundry.

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MCCOY AIR FORCE BASE - FLORIDA - DAY
</b>
tA pair of massive FILM CANISTERS unlock and drop from the
tbelly of the U-2.  TECHNICIANS secure them in orange carrying
tcases, lock them under key, fast and proficient.  They whisk
tthem out from under the spy plane.

tThe Technicians run for an idling Jeep.  They sling the cases
tinto the rear of the vehicle which in turn accelerates away
thard, curving across the runway for another waiting plane.

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
tA kitchen out of the late 1950's.  Kenny drinks coffee, ties
ta tie, rifles through a briefcase at the kitchen table.  The
thorde of kids, ages 2-14, breakfast on an array of period
tfood.  Kenny grills the kids while he goes over papers.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttSecretary of Defense...

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttDean Rusk!

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWrong, and you get to wax my car.

tKENNY JR. smirk at Kevin.

<b>ttttKENNY JR.
</b>ttRusk is State, moron.  Robert McNamara.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttGot time for pancakes?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttNope.  Attorney General?

tA PHONE RINGS as the kids cry out en masse.

<b>ttttKIDS
</b>ttt(chorus)
ttToo easy!  Bobby, Bobby Kennedy!

tKenny glances up at the wall.  There are two phones, side by
tside.  One RED, one BLACK.  It's the black one ringing. 
tHelen answers.  Kenny goes back to his papers.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttAll right, wise guys, Assistant
ttSecretary of State for Latin America...

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. STEUART BUILDING - DAY
</b>
tA U.S. Navy truck lurches to a stop in front of the run-down,
tbrick-faced seven-story Steuart Building on 5th and K.  Rear
tdoors BANG open, and out hop two MARINE GUARDS, side arms
tdrawn, film canisters in a carrying case between them.

<b>tSUPER:  NATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION CENTER
</b><b>t(NPIC), WASHINGTON D.C.
</b>
tAs the Marines approach the building, front doors SLAM open.

<b>tINT. OPERATIONS OFFICE, NPIC - DAY
</b>
tA bespectacled OPERATIONS MANAGER hands a clipboard to one of
tthe big Marine Guards who in turn hands him a set of keys. 
tThe Manager unlocks the film cases.  PHOTO INTERPRETERS swoop
tin, whisk away the contents: SPOOLS OF FILM.

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. O'DONNELL RESIDENCE - DAY
</b>
tA black Lincoln pulls away from the modest white house on a
ttidy Washington D.C. residential street.

<b>tEXT. WASHINGTON D.C., AERIAL - DAY
</b>
tThe car threads its way through the Washington traffic, past
tthe big administrative buildings, down tree-lined avenues,
ttakes a turn into a gate.  As the car stops at the gate, the
tCAMERA flies past, revealing it's the gate to the WHITE
<b>tHOUSE.
</b>
<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. NPIC - DAY
</b>
tCLOSE ON the five-thousand rolls of film spewing through
tprocessing equipment, its streaking passage leading us
tstraight through the development machinery to:

<b>tA SERIES OF VARIOUS SHOTS:
</b>
tPhoto Interpreters power up light tables, stereoscopic
tviewers, zip across the floor in wheeled chairs.

tFlying switches, flickering lights, humming motors.  It's an
teerie dance of technological black magic.

tAnother pair of Interpreters loom out of the darkness, side
tby side, ghostly looking, their glasses reflecting the glare
tof the light table, like magicians staring into a crystal
tball.

<b>tIMAGES FILL THE SCREEN
</b>
tAerial shots, flashing by.  Cuban countryside from 72,500
tfeet.  A MAGNIFYING GLASS swings down on its arm in front of
tus, magnifying the carpet of trees... and a row of six canvas
tcovered OBJECTS among them.

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - DAY
</b>
tKenny, in business suit and tie, trots up the steps, and a
tMARINE GUARD snaps the door open for him.

<b>tINT. WEST WING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tKenny, briefcase in hand, weaves his way through the empty,
tornate hallways of the West Wing.  Past magnificent doorways,
tearly American furniture, paintings.  He finally reaches a
tdoorway, goes through into:

<b>tINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tA long, narrow affair, window at the back looking out into
tthe Rose Garden.  Kenny dumps his briefcase on the desk,
tshucks off his coat, removes a folder from his briefcase,
tturns and heads back out...

<b>tINT. WEST WING HALLS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tAnd into the warren of offices and halls that is the working
tWhite House.  He takes a right, passes the doors to the Oval
tOffice right next to his office, goes down a long, straight
thall, into...

<b>tINT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tThe formal main building, the executive mansion.  He passes
tthe busts of Presidents past, turns left into an elevator. 
tThe doors close.

<b>tINT. 3RD FLOOR - FAMILY QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
tThe doors open.  Kenny strides out onto a DIFFERENT FLOOR,
tthe third.  He heads down the long, posh hall of the family
tquarters.  Fine furnishings, art.  The living White House.

tHe approaches the double doors at the end of the hall guarded
tby a cluster of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  An agent opens one of
tthe doors.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttMorning, Floyd.

<b>ttttSECRET SERVICE AGENT
</b>ttGood morning, Mr. O'Donnell.

<b>tINT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tKenny enters the elegant bedroom.  The figure alone at a side
ttable by the window, drinks coffee, breakfast still spread
tout before him, Washington Post obscuring his face.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttTop o' the morning, Mr. President.

tThe figure lowers the paper.

tIt is PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY.  He's wearing boxers and a
ttank top.  Unshaven.  Bed-head.

tKenny O'Donnell, former ward-pol and long-time Kennedy man,
tis his Chief of Staff...

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttMorning, Kenny.  You see this goddamn
ttCapehart stuff?

tThe President rattles the paper.  Kenny collapses in the
tchair opposite the President, sprawls, comfortable.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttBayh's going to lose, but it's good
ttgroundwork for us for '64.

tKenny steals a piece of buttered toast off the President's
tplate.  The President spares him a glance.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttI was eating that.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttNo you weren't.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttt(scanning the paper)
ttI was, you bastard.

tKenny takes a defiant bite.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttSo what've we got today?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttToday, for your information, is Pulaski
ttDay.  We're going to Buffalo...

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
</b>
<b>tSUPERIMPOSE: BUFFALO, NEW YORK
</b>
tA luxury hotel crowded with LOCAL POLS: the Democratic
tmachine of Buffalo.  Beyond the open floor-to-ceiling
twindows, a CROWD.  The Pulaski Day Parade, a glimpse of '69s
tAmericana.  High School bands blare Sousa.  The scene is
tdeafening, boisterous.  Pols trail Kenny as he crosses the
troom: fast, tough, on-the-go.

<b>ttttPOL #1
</b>ttWe're putting up Potowski next time. 
ttWill you guys come out for him?  

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWho else you got?

<b>ttttPOL #2
</b>ttThere's Richardson.  Good kid.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttGot the touch?

<b>ttttPOL #2
</b>ttYeah.  Still moldable, too.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttEveryone likes a good kid...

tAnd like that, a congressional candidate is made...  Kenny
taccelerates, leaving the Pols behind.  Suddenly, outside the
twindows, the crowd swells forward with a collective ROAR.

<b>ttttCROWD
</b><b>ttMR. PRESIDENT!  PRESIDENT KENNEDY!
</b>
<b>tEXT. HOTEL - DAY
</b>
tKenny heads down the steps with New York Times Washington
tBureau Chief, SCOTTY RESTON. Anonymous, they weave their way
tthrough the crowd for a police car on a side street.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttHow's my favorite President?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttBusy.  But you've got his heart.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttI want an hour with him.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttI said his heart, not his attention.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttThree weeks before midterm elections? 
ttYou need me.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWell.  There is a new civil rights
ttinitiative he wants to talk about.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttI'm doing a piece on Skybolt.  I hear
ttMacmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.

tKenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car. 
tA Secret Service Agent opens the door for him, another is
tbehind the wheel.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWe're giving the Brits Polaris instead. 
ttBut a story'll just aggravate things.

tScotty stares at Kenny, determined.  Kenny looks away.  And
this eye catches a tall, willowy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.  She is
ttalking, excited, embarrassed, to two more SECRET SERVICE
tAGENTS.  What they're saying is lost in the noise.

tScotty follows Kenny's gaze.  Then the two men share a look,
ta silent understanding.  Kenny glances at the Secret Service
tguy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>ttNot today.  He's got tight schedule.

tThe Agent nods, heads for the other Agents and the Beautiful
tWoman.  Scotty acts like nothing has happened.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttPretending there isn't a problem won't
ttfix it.  He can clear the air on Anglo
ttAmerican relations.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttForget it, Scotty.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttLet him talk to me, he makes Macmillan
ttlook good, I print it, the British
ttpublic likes it, Macmillan owes you.

tThe formula's exactly what Kenny wants to hear.  He pretends
tto consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttAll right, you're in.  Half hour.

tReston's won.  But so has Kenny, and he's made Scotty feel
ttough in the bargain.  People like Kenny.

<b>tINT. POLICE CAR - DAY
</b>
tIn the back seat, Kenny stares out the window at the parade
tgoers.  The Secret Service Agents leave the Woman. 
tDisappointed, the Woman turns and vanishes into the crowd. 
tIt's an eerie moment.  Something troubles Kenny, and he
tglances up at the sky.  A premonition.  But it's a clear,
tclear blue.  A day like this, all is right with the world...

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. NPIC - NIGHT
</b>
tSix Interpreters huddle around IMAGES on a light table.  One
tof them shoulders his way into the group and THUMPS a black
tBINDER on the table.  There are grim nods of agreement.

tThe book is open to a PICTURE of an SS-4 BALLISTIC MISSILE. 
tA photo from Moscow Mayday parade.  An icon of the nuclear
tage escorted like some devil-god to a holocaust...

<b>tEND MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE
</b>
<b>tEXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
tThe White House casts long shadows this gorgeous October
tmorning.  Blue sky; the first flash of color in the trees.

<b>tSUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16TH, 1962.  DAY 1.
</b>
<b>tINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tBriefcase and coat in hand, Kenny enters his office - and
tfinds THREE MEN.  Standing there.  Thin-haired, bespectacled,
tacademic-looking MCGEORGE BUNDY, 43, the National Security
tAdvisor.  The two men in the background: PHOTO INTERPRETERS.

tKenny hangs up his coat, sees the Interpreters' large black
tdisplay cases.  And suddenly the world is slightly off
tkilter.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttHey, Mac.  You're up bright and early.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttNo, Ken.  I need to see him now...

<b>tINT. WHITE HOUSE - RESIDENTIAL FLOOR - DAY
</b>
tKenny emerges from the elevator with Bundy.  They head down
tthe long, posh 3rd floor hall, the Presidential Detail
tguarding the doors at the end.  But the familiar route feels
tstrange, and lasting an eternity.  Kenny eyes the package
tunder Bundy's arm, its TOP SECRET stamp visible.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttMorning, Floyd.

<b>ttttSECRET SERVICE AGENT
</b>ttGood morning, Mr. O'Donnell.  Mr. Bundy.

tThe Agent opens the door.  Bundy pauses, Kenny with him.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWhat's it about?

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttCuba.

tBundy is tense.  But Kenny relaxes.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttJust Cuba?  Okay, I got work to do, see
ttyou guys downstairs.

<b>tINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tKenny's office is a raging beehive of activity.  Kenny works
tthe phone as ASSISTANTS come and go with files.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttt(to phone, scary calm)
ttListen to me, you worthless piece of
ttdisloyal shit.  You will pull Daly's man
tton the circuit.  You owe your goddamn
ttjob to this administration.
ttt(beat, listening)
ttThere is a word you need to learn.  It
ttis the only word in politics.  Loyalty. 
ttLOYALTY you motherfucking piece of shit!

tAs Kenny THROWS the phone down at the receiver, and the
tPRIVATE DOOR to the Oval Office suddenly opens.  Kenny
tglances up.  President Kennedy stands there in the doorway. 
tKenny thinks he's reacting to the tirade.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhat're you looking at?  This isn't the
ttblessed order of St. Mary the Meek.

tKenny stops.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>ttExcuse us.

tThe Assistants leave, shutting the door after them.  Kenny
trises.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttI think you should come in here.

tKenny starts for the door.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttStill think Cuba isn't important?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttNot as far as the election goes.

tThe President lets Kenny by into...

<b>tINT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tWE ENTER from a different angle than we usually enter in
tmovies: through the side door.  The President's ornate desk
tsits on the right, windows looking out on the Rose Garden
tbehind it.  Kenny's gaze swivels to:

tTHE OTHER END OF THE ROOM where the Interpreters, their
tcrewcut chief, ARTHUR LUNDAHL, 50's, and Bundy stare at him. 
tThey're surrounded by PRESENTATION BOARDS propped up around
tthe fireplace.  The President's rocking chair and sofas.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttYou used to look down a bomb sight for a
ttliving, Ken.  What do you see?

tIn eerie silence, as all eyes follow him, Kenny makes his way
tamong the presentation boards with the U-2 imagery, stops in
tfront of the picture of the six canvas-covered objects.  It
tunleashes a wave of memories.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWe hit a Nazi buzz bomb field in '45. 
ttt(beat, incredulous)
ttIt looks like a rocket base...

tHe puts his hand out to touch the image, then turns and looks
tto the President, knowing what they must be.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttOn Sunday morning, one of our U-2s took
ttthese pictures.  The Soviets are putting
ttmedium range ballistic missiles into
ttCuba.

tShock.  Silence.  Kenny glances to the other men.

<b>ttttLUNDAHL
</b>ttThey appear to be the SS-4: range of a
ttthousand miles, three-megaton nuclear
ttwarhead.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttJesus Christ in Heaven...

<b>tINT. WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR'S CENTER - DAY
</b>
tA bank of WHITE HOUSE OPERATORS work the switchboard, fingers
tflying, voices overlapping in a babble of:

<b>ttttVARIOUS OPERATORS
</b>ttPlease hold for the White House...Mr.
ttO'Donnell for Secretary McNamara...
ttWhite House Operator... please hold...

<b>tINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tKenny carries the phone with him as he paces hard from his
tdesk to his window.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThe principals are assembling in an
tthour.  See you then.

tKenny hangs up.  The President enters.  A beat.  And in that
tbeat, there's a void.  The two men are off their emotional
tstride, trying to grope their way out of shock.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttWhere's Bobby?

tKenny nods, acknowledging the feeling

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttShould be here any minute.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttGood.

tAnd we glimpse the chemistry of these guys by Bobby's
tabsence.  It's like they're missing their third wheel.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttGood.

<b>ttttBOBBY (O.S.)
</b>ttWhere the hell are you?

tThe President and Kenny hear him out in the hall.  And the
ttension goes out of them instantly.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttIn here!

tThey turn to the door as BOBBY KENNEDY, 37, the President's
tyounger brother/Attorney General, enters.  Bobby shuts the
tdoor behind him, falls into Kenny's chair, and clearly
tgrappling with his own disbelief, is hushed.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttJesus Christ, guys.  What the hell's
ttKhruschev thinking?

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttDid you have any indication of this from
ttGeorgi?  Any possible warning or sense
ttof motivation?

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttt(shaking his head)
ttComplete snowjob.  And then we went out
ttand told the country they weren't
ttputting missiles into Cuba.
ttt(beat)
ttBy the way, you realize we just lost the
ttmidterms.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWho gives a shit about the midterms now? 
ttThe Soviets are putting nuclear weapons
ttninety miles away from us.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttYou mean there's something more
ttimportant than votes?  Didn't think I'd
ttlive to see the day, Ken.

tThe President paces away, grim.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttJesus.  I feel like we've caught the Jap
ttcarriers steaming for Pearl Harbor.

<b>tINT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tThe President strides down the plush hallway, Bobby and Kenny
tflanking him.  Unconsciously, all three men assume the same
tgait: confident, powerful, no longer disoriented.

tAnd before our eyes, the three men's game faces appear, and
tthey become the hard-ass leaders of the United States. 
tSecret Service Agents throw open the massive double doors to
tthe Cabinet Room.

<b>tINT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tAnd they enter.  The group of men at the long, ornate
tRoosevelt-era table, rise as one.

<b>ttttGROUP
</b>ttGood morning, Mr. President.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttGood morning, gentlemen.

tAnd the doors close on the eighteen men of EXCOM: The
tExecutive Committee of the National Security Council.  They
tare the legendary "Best and Brightest."

tThe President makes his way down the line: shakes hands with
tSecretary of State DEAN RUSK, 53, distinguished, with a soft,
tGeorgian accent, a distant reserve.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttDean, good morning.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttMr. President.

tThe President leans past him, grasps the hand of the
tSecretary of Defense ROBERT MCNAMARA, 46, a gifted managerial
tgenius... the price of which is a cold, hard personality.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttBob.  Bet you had a late night.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttSleep is for the weak, Mr. President.

tOFF TO THE SIDE, Kenny greets Vice President LYNDON JOHNSON,
t54, and ADLAI STEVENSON, 62, Representative to the U.N.,
tintellectual, well-spoken.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttLyndon.  Adlai.

tThe silver-haired war hero and politically savvy Chairman of
tThe Joint Chiefs of Staff, GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR, 50s,
tshakes the President's hand.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttMax.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttMcCone's been notified and is coming
ttback from the West coast.  Carter's
tthere, though.

tHe gestures to GENERAL MARSHALL CARTER, Deputy Chief of
tOperations for the CIA.  Carter nods to the President.

<b>tTHE CAMERA PANS OVER THE OTHERS.
</b>
tDOUGLAS DILLON, ex-banker, Secretary of the Treasury.

tROSWELL GILPATRIC, studious Deputy Secretary of Defense.

tPAUL NITZE, 55, the detail-driven facts man, Assistant
tSecretary of Defense.

tGEORGE BALL, 50s, Undersecretary of State.  Eloquent, a man
tof conscience.

tU. ALEXIS JOHNSON, Deputy Under Secretary of State.

tEDWARD MARTIN, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin
tAmerica.

tLLEWELLYN THOMPSON, laid back, rumpled Soviet Affairs
tAdvisor.

tDON WILSON, Deputy Director of the USIA.

tThe President sits down at the center of the table, Rusk and
tMcNamara to either side, and the others resume their seats. 
tBobby takes one of the over-stuffed chairs at the table.

tKenny finds one along the wall behind the President, under
tthe windows to the Rose Garden to TED SORENSEN, 30s, the
tPresident's legal counsel and speech writer.  They greet each
tother coolly.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttTed.

<b>ttttSORENSEN
</b>ttKenny.

tThe room falls silent.  The President looks across the table
tto GENERAL CARTER.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttOkay.  Let's have it.

<b>ttttGENERAL CARTER
</b>ttArthur Lundahl heads our photographic
ttinterpretation division at CIA.  I'll
ttlet him and his boys take you through
ttwhat we've got.  Arthur?

tLundahl, standing at the end of the room with briefing
tboards, steps forward with a pointer.

<b>ttttLUNDAHL
</b>ttGentlemen, as most of you now know a U-2
ttover Cuba on Sunday morning took a
ttseries of disturbing photographs.

<b>tSWINGING THE POINTER AT A BOARD SMASH CUTS US TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MISSILE SITE - LOS PALACIOS, CUBA - DAY
</b>
tThe sweltering Cuban countryside.  Shouting SOVIET ROCKET
tTROOPS, stripped to the waist, glistening with sweat, machete
ta clearing under scattered, limp palm trees.

<b>ttttLUNDAHL (V.O.)
</b>ttOur analysis at NPIC indicates the
ttSoviet Union has followed its
ttconventional weapons build-up in Cuba
ttwith the introduction of surface-to
ttsurface medium-range ballistic missiles,
ttor MRBMs.  Our official estimate at this
tttime is that this missile system is the
ttSS-4 Sandal.  We do not believe these
ttmissiles are as yet operational.

tA bulldozer TEARS through the undergrowth.  FILLING THE
tSCREEN.  A 70-foot long MISSILE TRANSPORTER creeps along in
tthe bulldozer's wake like a vast hearse with its shrouded
tcargo.

<b>tINT. CABINET ROOM - DAY
</b>
tLundahl raps his second board: a map of the United States,
tCuba visible in the lower corner.  An ARC is drawn clearly
tacross the U.S., encompassing the entire Southeast.

<b>ttttLUNDAHL
</b>ttIRONBARK reports the SS-4 can deliver a
tt3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles.  So

ttserved by around 3400 men, undoubtedly
ttall Soviet personnel.  Our cities and
ttmilitary installations in the Southeast,
ttas far north as Washington, are in range
ttof these weapons, and in the event of a
ttlaunch, would only have five minutes of
ttwarning.

<b>ttttGENERAL CARTER
</b>ttFive minutes, gentlemen.  Five minutes.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttIn those five minutes they could kill 80
ttmillion Americans and destroy a
ttsignificant number of our bomber bases,
ttdegrading our retaliatory options.  The
ttJoint Chiefs' consensus is that this is
tta massively destabilizing move,
ttupsetting the nuclear balance.

tThe President stares at Lundahl, and beating out each word.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttArthur.  Are. You. Sure?

tLundahl looks around the room.  Everyone is hanging.

<b>ttttLUNDAHL
</b>ttYes, Mr. President.  These are nuclear
ttmissiles.

tThe men come to grips with their own fears, own anger.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttHow long until they're operational?

<b>ttttLUNDAHL
</b>ttGeneral Taylor can answer that question
ttbetter than I can.

tGeneral Taylor drops a memo on the table WHICH BECOMES:

<b>tEXT. FIELD TABLE - MISSILE SITE, CUBA - DAY
</b>
tSCHEMATICS slapped down on a camp table.  A group of Soviet
tsite ENGINEERS point and gesture as they study their ground
tfrom a shaded hillock.  CLEARING CREWS and SURVEYORS work and
tsweat in the distance.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR (V.O.)
</b>ttGMAIC estimates ten to fourteen days. 
ttHowever, a crash program to ready the
ttmissiles could cut that time.



<b>tINT. CABINET ROOM - DAY
</b>
tTaylor sees the grim looks all around.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttI have to stress that there may be more
ttmissiles that we don't know about.  We
ttneed more U-2 coverage.

tKenny lets out his breath.  He catches Bobby's eye.  This is
tunbelievable.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttIs there any indication - anything at
ttall - that suggests they intend to use
ttthese missiles in some sort of first
ttstrike?

<b>ttttGENERAL CARTER
</b>ttNot at present, sir.  But I think the
ttprudent answer is we don't know.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttDo we have any sort of intelligence from
ttCIA on what Khruschev is thinking?

<b>ttttGENERAL CARTER
</b>ttNo, Mr. President.  We don't.  We just
ttdon't know what's happening inside the
ttKremlin at that level.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttThey lied to us.  Two weeks ago Dobrynin
tttold me to my face Khurschev had no
ttintention of putting missiles into Cuba. 
ttThey said themselves, this is our
ttbackyard.

tThere's angry agreement.  The President cuts it off.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttGentlemen, I want first reactions. 
ttAssuming for a moment Khruschev has not
ttgone off the deep end and intends to
ttstart World War Three, what are we
ttlooking at?

tRusk glances to his team at the end of the table.  Ball,
tJohnson, Martin, Thompson and Stevenson.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttMr. President, I believe my team is in
ttagreement.  If we permit the
ttintroduction of nuclear missiles to a
ttSoviet satellite nation in our
tthemisphere, the diplomatic consequences
ttwill be too terrible to contemplate. 
ttThe Russians are trying to show the
ttworld they can do whatever they want,
ttwherever they want, and we're powerless
ttto stop them.  If they succeed...

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttIt will be Munich all over again.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttAppeasement only makes the aggressor
ttmore aggressive.  Confidence in our
ttsecurity commitments around the world
ttwill falter, allies will become unsure
ttin the face of Soviet pressure, and the
ttSoviets will be emboldened to push us
tteven harder.  We must remove the
ttmissiles one way or another.  It seems
ttto me the options are either to build up
ttthe crisis 'til they give in, or we hit
ttthem.  An air strike.

tThere's silence at the table.  Some nods.  Understanding.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttBob?

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttWe've worked up several military
ttscenarios.  Before I ask General Taylor
ttto lead us through the various options,
ttI'd like for us to adopt a rule. 
ttIf we are going to strike, we must agree
ttnow that we will do it before the
ttmissiles become operational.  Because
ttonce they are, I don't think we can
ttguarantee getting them all before at
ttleast some are launched.

tAnd there it is.  The clock is running.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttSir.  We need to consider... if we
ttdecide to act, there's a good chance
ttwe'll end up in a general war.

tThe room falls silent.  The President leans back in his
tchair, studying the circle of men around the table, weighing
tthem.

tKenny and the others watch him in silence.  A long, dramatic
tpause.  A course that will change history is about to be
tchosen.  The President leans forward, folds his hands on the
ttable.  Fated.  Grave.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttIt's clear we cannot permit Soviet
ttnuclear missiles in Cuba.  We must get
ttthose missiles out.

<b>tEXT. THE ROSE GARDEN - DAY
</b>
tKenny and Bobby follow the President down a path through the
tRose Garden.  The shock of the morning has worn off.  The
tPresident stops, looks at them.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttI don't think it's going to matter what
ttKhruschev's intentions are.  I tell you,
ttright now... I don't see any way around
tthitting them.

tA long moment of silence as they move along again.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttIf we hit 'em, kill a lot of Russians,
ttthey'll move against Berlin.  They
ttattack Berlin, that's NATO... and we're
ttat war.

tThe guys stop again.  The autumn day is bright, warm, alive. 
tThe air, the distant city sounds derail the relentless train
tof logic for a beat.  And in their faces we see that all
tthree men, for the first time, feel the enormity of war, its
tshadow over everything.  It's only a couple of steps away. 
tSteps that they're seriously contemplating.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttDamned if we do, but if we don't, we're
ttin a war for sure somewhere else in six
ttmonths.

tPained, the President turns away.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttNo choice.  This is going to cost lives
ttany way we go.  Do nothing, and it could
ttbe 80 million  of ours.  We have to get
ttrid of those missiles.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThere've got to be alternatives to just
ttgoing out and bombing them.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttHe's right, Jack.  Taylor is saying we
ttmay have some time.  We've got to use
ttit.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttSo if there are alternatives that make
ttsense - and I'm not saying there are -
ttwe need 'em.  Need 'em fast.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWhat about the allies?  Congress?  I
ttthink we may need to start letting key
ttpeople know.  And they're all scattered
ttacross the country for the campaign. 
ttWe're going to need to get the U.N.
ttstaff in and warmed up.  Jesus... I
ttdon't even know if we've got secure
ttcommunications with half our embassies
ttsince that the Soviets got that
ttcryptographer of ours.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttWe can't worry about everything right
ttnow.  We've got to figure out what we're
ttgoing to do before we worry about how we
ttdo it.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThe other thing is...

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>tt... I know.  CIA and the military fucked
ttus on the Bay of Pigs.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThey're going to be pressing for a
ttmilitary solution soon.  We can't afford
ttto let them ram their agenda down our
ttthroats.  We need to come with options
ttother than air strikes so we have some
ttsort of choice here.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWe got a bunch of smart guys.  We lock
tt'em up together in there, kick 'em in
ttthe ass til they come up with options.

tKenny and the President look at him.  Bobby nods.

<b>ttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttI'll do it.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttt(to the President)
ttIt's too politicized with you in there,
ttanyway.  They need to be able to stick
tttheir necks out.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttIt'll be the principals, a couple of the
ttkey guys from each department: the
ttExecutive Committee of the National
ttSecurity Council.  We'll call it EXCOM.

tKenny snorts a laugh.  Bobby shoots him a cross look.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttEXCOM.  Has a ring to it.  Like F-Troop.

tThe President stops.  Bobby and Kenny stop, too.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttOkay.  Kenny and I only show for the
ttmeetings you call us into.  Impress us. 
ttAnd do it fast.
ttt(to Kenny)
ttYou're in charge of keeping this quiet. 
ttIf word gets out before we know what
ttwe're going to do, there'll be panic. 
ttAnd it'll ruin any chance of surprise if
ttwe decide to hit them.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThen we need to do a few things right
ttaway.  No Pierre.  He knows, the press
ttknows. 
ttYou're going to have to keep up your
ttschedule - your movements are followed
tttoo closely.  And we need to get these
ttguys out of the White House.  George
ttBall's got a conference room at State.
ttt(to Bobby)
ttReconvene over there this afternoon,
ttcome back here tonight.

tBobby nods.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttI think we should bring in Dean Acheson. 
ttHe was fighting Soviets while we were
ttstill working the wards in Boston.

tThe President nods his approval.  Looks at Kenny.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttFind him, Kenny.  We're going to need
ttall the help we can get.

<b>tINT. WEST WING - HALL OUTSIDE PRESS OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tKenny moves hard and fast through the twisting warren of
thallways and tiny offices which is the West Wing.  Suddenly,
tScotty Reston pops out of a doorway behind Kenny.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttHey, Kenny!  Who died?

tKenny glances over his shoulder at Scotty who points to a
twindow.  A beat, then Kenny returns to look out the window. 
tOutside, the West Wing Drive is FILLED WITH LIMOUSINES.

tA flash of dismay, but Kenny covers fast.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWay it's going, the Democratic Party. 
ttDNC strategy session.  If you can call
ttit that.

tScotty chuckles.  Kenny moves off, leading him away.  Kenny's
tassistant runs up behind him, holding out a slip of paper.

<b>ttttASSISTANT
</b>ttSir?

tKenny tries to look him away.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttIt's Tuesday.  You said to call.  When
ttdo I get my 45 minutes?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttTell you what.  We're in Connecticut
tttomorrow for Ribicoff.  I'll get you up
ttfront with him during the flight.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttDeal.

<b>ttttASSISTANT
</b>ttSir.

tKenny turns, harsh

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWhat is it?

tThe Assistant eyes Scotty, holds his tongue.  Kenny takes the
tslips.

<b>ttttASSISTANT
</b>ttThe number you asked for.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttI ask for a lot of 'em.  Whose is it?

<b>ttttASSISTANT
</b>ttDean Acheson's, sir.

tThat shuts Kenny up.  Reston eyes the slip, then looks to
tKenny's face.  And he knows something isn't right here.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttGotta go, Scotty.  See you tomorrow.

<b>tINT. TREASURY BUILDING GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
tA car jolts to a stop.  The CAMERA PANS up over the sagging
tsuspension, the government plates, the hood ornament
trevealing half of EXCOM inside.  Kenny stands nearby waiting
tfor them.

tThe doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns:
tBobby, McNamara, Rusk, Ball, Martin, Dioptric, Sorensen,
tStevenson, and Nitze.  They're sitting in each others' laps,
tbanging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttScrew secrecy.  You try having that fat
ttass sit on your lap all the way from
ttFoggy Bottom.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttYou were excited.  I say no more.

tThe gang falls in behind Kenny, trails him out of the garage.

<b>tINT. TUNNEL TO WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tA steel door unlocks, swings open, and Kenny marches at the
thead of the wedge of men into a long tunnel.  It's the
tinfamous old passage from the Treasury to the White House. 
tKenny and Bobby get a little ahead of the others.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttEverybody agrees the diplomatic route is
ttout.  It's too slow, and they'll have
ttthe missiles finished.

tKenny looks at him.  Then there's only one alternative.  The
tCAMERA wipes through the ceiling to:

<b>tEXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tGROUND LEVEL.  Where the brilliantly-lit flag flutters over
tthe spotlit White House: their destination.

<b>tINT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tGENERAL WALTER 'CAM' SWEENEY, head of Tactical Air Command,
tstands at the head of the table with a presentation board. 
tThe men of EXCOM gather around Sweeney in their rumpled
tshirts, nursing coffee and cigarettes.

<b>ttttGENERAL SWEENEY
</b>ttWe have 850 planes assembling at
ttHomestead, Eglin, Opa Locka, MacDill,
ttPatrick, Pensacola and Key West.

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. HOMESTEAD AFB - FLORIDA - NIGHT
</b>
tAn F-100 Super Sabre stands under lights on a taxiway.  The
tCAMERA DESCENDS FROM ITS OVERHEAD SHOT, discovering the
taircraft's sleek cockpit, menacing tiger-jaw paint job, the
tfour 20mm cannons on its nose.

<b>ttttGENERAL SWEENEY (V.O.)
</b>ttDue to the tropical foliage, the OPLAN
ttcalls for high-explosive and napalm
ttloadouts for our ground attack sorties.

<b>tPULL BACK TO REVEAL:
</b>
tThe FLIGHT LINE where a full strike wing stands beyond this
tplane, pylons laden with weapons, GROUND CREW servicing them.

<b>tINT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tOther EXCOM members draw near the board, its order of battle,
tstrike maps.  They're grim, but fascinated.  Empowering. 
tIntoxicating.  Sexy.  Kenny sees it in the faces, even the
tPresident's.  Adlai does too, is upset.

<b>ttttADLAI
</b>ttI still think there are diplomatic
ttapproaches we haven't considered yet.

tKenny looks at Adlai.  The others around the room,
tembarrassed, don't respond.  The group has moved on and
tStevenson hasn't.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttWe have high confidence in the expanded
ttair strike option.
ttt(beat)
ttThe problem, Mr. President, is that it's
tta short-term solution.  Khruschev can
ttsend more missiles next month.  The
ttChiefs and I believe we should follow up
ttthe air strikes with the full version of
<b>ttOPLAN 316.
</b>
<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttAn invasion...

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttYes, sir.  We can be sure we get all the
ttmissiles, and we remove Castro so this
ttcan never happen again.

tKenny looks around the room at the men, the murmurs of
tgeneral agreement, senses the consensus building and is
tagitated.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttIs this the Chiefs' recommendation?

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttYes, sir.  Our best option is to
ttcommence the strikes before the missiles
ttare operational.  The invasion happens
tteight days later.

tThe President leans back in his chair, turns to the man at
tthe far end of the table: DEAN ACHESON, 60s, former Secretary
tof State.  He sits silent, like some revered oracle, the
tarchitect of the American Cold War strategy of containment.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttDean.  What do you think?

tAcheson arches an eyebrow, and when he speaks, his voice
tresonates throughout the room, powerful, smooth, hypnotic.

<b>ttttACHESON
</b>ttMr. President, you have rightly
ttdismissed the diplomatic option.  The
ttSoviet will only tie you down in
ttnegotiation, and leave us short of our
ttgoal, the removal of the missiles. 
ttNegotiating will do nothing more than
ttgive them time to make the missiles
ttoperational, complicating the necessary
ttmilitary task we have at hand.

tEveryone in the room listens to him with rapt attention, his
tpresence overshadowing the room, oracular:

<b>ttttACHESON (CONT'D)
</b>ttFor the last fifteen years, I have
ttfought here at this table along side
ttyour predecessors in the struggle
ttagainst the Soviet.  Gentlemen, I do not
ttwish to seem melodramatic, but I do wish
ttto impress upon you one observation with
ttall conceivable sincerity.  A lesson I
tthave learned with bitter tears and great
ttsacrifice.
ttt(beat)
ttThe Soviet understands only one
ttlanguage: action.  It respects only one
ttword: force.

tKenny stares at the old man.  Acheson's gaze finds his
tthrough the cigarette smoke.  Acheson's eyes travel to the
tPresident.

<b>ttttACHESON (CONT'D)
</b>ttI concur with General Taylor.  I
ttrecommend, sir, air strikes followed by
ttinvasion, perhaps preceded by an
ttultimatum to dismantle the missiles if
ttmilitary necessity permits.

tTaylor nods, vindicated.  The others murmur their approval. 
tBobby, at the table in front of Kenny and to his left, trades
ta dire look with Kenny.  This is happening too fast.  Bobby
tholds his head, looks about at the others, deeply distressed.

tThe President sinks back in his chair, staring at Acheson.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttThen it appears we have three options. 
ttNumber one.  A surgical air strike
ttagainst the missiles themselves.  Two, a
ttlarger air strike against their air
ttdefenses along with the missiles.

tKenny eyes Bobby.  Bobby is writing something.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttAnd three, invasion.

tBobby looks over his shoulder at Kenny, and REACHES BACK to
thim with a folded NOTE.  Kenny takes it, opens it.

tIt reads NOW I KNOW WHO TOJO FELT PLANNING PEARL HARBOR.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe're certainly going to do number one;
ttwe're going to take out these missiles,
ttso it seems to me we don't have to wait
ttvery long.  We ought to at least be
ttmaking those preparations.

tKenny gives Bobby a curt nod.  Bobby tilts his head at the
tPresident: pass the note on to him.  Kenny rises, slips the
tnote in front of the President.

tThe President unfolds the note, and we HOLD ON IT and his
treaction as in the b.g., out of focus, Taylor speaks:

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttYes, sir, we're preparing to implement
ttall three options, though I must stress
ttagain, sir, there are risks to the
ttstrikes without the follow-on invasion.

tBundy clears his throat.  Speaks from somewhere down the
ttable.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttYou want to be clear, Mr. President,
ttthat we have definitely decided against
tta political track.

tThe President folds the note away, glances at Bobby.  A beat,
tthe President looks from Bobby to Acheson.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttDean, how does this play out?

<b>ttttACHESON
</b>ttYour first step, sir, will be to demand
ttthat the Soviet withdraw the missiles
ttwithin 12 to 24 hours.  They will
ttrefuse.  When they do, you will order
ttthe strikes, followed by the invasion. 
ttThey will resist, but will be overrun. 
ttThey will retaliate against a target
ttsomewhere else in the world, most likely
ttBerlin.  We will honor our treaty
ttcommitments and resist them there,
ttdefeating them per our plans.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttThose plans call for the use of nuclear
ttweapons.
ttt(beat)
ttAnd what is the next step?

tAcheson sits back in his chair, smooths his moustache.  A
tdramatic beat, and then his ominous pronouncement rings out:

<b>ttttACHESON
</b>ttHopefully cooler heads will prevail
ttbefore we reach the next step.

tA chill runs down Kenny's spine.  He looks in shock to the
tPresident.  The President remains calm.  But in place of the
tfated look the President has had, there's a hesitation.

<b>tINT. WEST WING HALLS - NIGHT
</b>
tAcheson strides down the hall, Taylor, Sweeney, Carter and
tBundy swept along behind him.  Bundy is on the defensive, the
tothers grim.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttIf McNamara'd get off the fence...

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttWe have time.

<b>ttttGENERAL CARTER
</b>ttGoddamn it, it's obvious.  It's the only
ttoption.  That asshole, Stevenson.  We
ttcan't let this drag out or we lose our
ttshot.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttBombing them...

<b>ttttACHESON
</b>ttRemember that the Kennedys' father was
ttone of the architects of Munich.  The
ttGeneral is right.  There is only one
ttresponsible choice here.

tBundy just nods.  Taylor grabs a door ahead for Acheson.

<b>ttttACHESON (CONT'D)
</b>ttLet's pray appeasement doesn't run in
ttfamilies.  I fear weakness does.

tAnd the men head into a stairwell going down.

<b>tINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tGrimacing in pain.  He opens a pill bottle, takes two pills
tout.  He takes a whiskey in a shot glass from Kenny.

<b>tRESUME
</b>
tKenny finishes pouring him and Bobby a couple of more shots,
tdiscreetly turning a blind eye to the President's pain.

tThe President returns from his desk, shirt untucked,
tdisheveled, back stiff.  He eases into his rocking chair. 
tBobby lies sprawled on the couch.  Kenny sits down.  They all
tlook at each other.  A beat, something like shock.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttJesus Christ Almighty...

tThey burst out laughing.  An absurd, tension draining moment. 
tThey shoot their drinks, Kenny refills.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>ttCall me Irish, but I don't believe in
ttcooler heads prevailing.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttAcheson's scenario is unacceptable.  And
tthe has more experience than anyone.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThere is no expert on this subject, no
ttwise old man.

tThe President stares Kenny in the face, understanding.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttThe thing is, Acheson's right.  Talk
ttalone won't accomplish anything.

tKenny considers the President, his face straight as he says:

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThen let's bomb the shit out of them.
ttEveryone wants to, even you, even me.
ttt(there's a point)
ttIt sure would feel good.

tThe President sees what Kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional
tresponse, not necessarily the intelligent one.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttJack, I'm as conniving as they come, but
tta sneak attack is just wrong.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttHe's right.  And things are happening
tttoo fast.  It smells like the Bay of
ttPigs all over again.

tBobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee
ttable.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttAs if dealing with the Russians wasn't
tthard enough, we gotta worry about our
ttown house.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttTonight, listening to Taylor and
ttAcheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles
tttelling me all I had to do was sign on
ttthe dotted line.  The invasion would
ttsucceed.  Castro would be gone.  Just
ttlike that.  Easy.

tThe President is rendered mute by a wave of pain.  Kenny and
tBobby aver their eyes.  When it passes, the President is
thushed, grave.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttThere's something...immoral about
ttabandoning your own judgement.

tKenny nods, moved.  The President reaches out for the
treconnaissance photos Bobby's flipping through.  Bobby hands
tthem to him.  The President looks them over.  And when he
tspeaks, there's humility.  And resolve.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe can't let things get ahead of

tA LONG SHOT of an ENORMOUS CROWD thronging a bunting-trimmed

tcatches Kenny's look.

</b>ttYeah?  Who was he talking to?  Acheson? 
ttCome on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering
ttwhat's going on.  What's Acheson doing
ttin town?  And don't give me some
ttbullshit about DNC think tanks. 
ttAcheson's Mr. Cold War.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWhy don't you ask him yourself?  You can
tthave him on the way home.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttI'm giving you a chance here: talk to
ttme.  You can influence how this thing
ttunfolds.

tBut Kenny stands there, mute.  Reston just shakes his head,
tknowing for sure something's up.  He turns and heads back for
tthe press corps.

<b>ttEXT. STAIRS TO AIR FORCE ONE - DAY
</b>
tKenny and the President climb the stairs to the Presidential
tplane, the crowd cheering him.  He gives a final wave.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttLet's get out of here.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttCheer up, you've neutralized the entire
ttWhite House Press Corps for a day.

<b>tINT. GEORGE BALL'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
tEXCOM meets in George Ball's small conference room at the
tState Department.  Bobby, in shirtsleeves, paces at the head
tof the table, very, very alone.  All eyes are on him.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttNo.  No.  No.  There is more than one
ttoption here.  If one isn't occurring to
ttus, it's because we haven't thought hard
ttenough.

tMcNamara squirms.  The others react in frustration.  CIA
tchief JOHN MCCONE, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttSometimes there is only one right
ttchoice, and you thank God when it's
ttclear.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttYou're talking about a sneak attack! 
ttHow'll that make us look?  Big country
ttblasting a little one into the stone
ttage.  We'll be real favorites around the
ttworld.

<b>ttttACHESON
</b>ttBobby, that's naive.  This is the real
ttworld, you know that better than
ttanybody.  Your argument is ridiculous.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttYou weren't so ethically particular when
ttwe were talking about options for
ttremoving Castro over at CIA.

tAnd there's nothing Bobby can say to that.  He props himself
tup on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its
tshiny surface somewhere.  There is only the reflection of his
town face.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttI can't let my brother go down in
ttHistory like a villain, like a Tojo,
ttordering another Pearl Harbor.

tMcCone, Acheson, and Taylor share a look.  The last
tresistance to airstrikes is crumbling.  Finally, Bobby looks
tup at McNamara.

<b>ttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttBob.  If we go ahead with these air
ttstrikes...
ttt(beat)
ttThere's got to be something else.  Give
ttit to me.  I don't care how crazy,
ttinadequate or stupid it sounds.  
ttt(beat, pleading)
ttGive it to me.

tMcNamara suffers under the gaze of everyone at the table,
tweighing the situation out.  And finally he ventures.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttSix months ago we gamed out a scenario. 
ttIt's slow.  It doesn't get rid of the
ttmissiles.  There are a lot of drawbacks.
ttt(beat)
ttThe scenario was for a blockade of Cuba.

<b>tSUPER: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18TH.  DAY 3
</b>
<b>tINT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tKenny enters the office from his side door in the middle of a
tdebate.  Military uniforms dominate the room: General Taylor,
tGeneral Sweeney, and a host of briefing officers.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttThe situation is worse than we thought. 
ttWe count 40 missiles now, longer range
ttIRBMs.  They can hit every city in the
ttcontinental U.S.

tThe President stares out the window at the Rose Garden, his
tback to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY, 60. 
tBeetle-browed, arrogant, the archetypal Cold War general. 
tYet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps,
tthat suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in.

tThe only other civilians in the room are Bobby, Bundy and
tMcNamara.  The pressure from the military is almost physical.

<b>ttttLEMAY
</b>ttMr. President, as of this moment my
ttplanes are ready to carry out the air
ttstrikes.  All you have to do is give me
ttthe word, sir, and my boys will get
ttthose Red bastards.

tThe President continues staring out the window.  Kenny eases
tover to the desk, leans on it, arms folded, interposing
thimself between the President and the soldiers.  Bobby joins
thim, side-by-side.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttHow long until the army is ready?

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttWe've just begun the mobilization under
ttcover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. 
ttWe're looking at another week and a
tthalf, Mr. President.

<b>ttttLEMAY
</b>ttBut you can begin the strikes, now.  The
ttplans call for an eight-day air
ttcampaign.  It'd light a fire under the
ttarmy's ass to get in place.

tThat makes the President turn around, stare at LeMay.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttGeneral LeMay, do you truly believe
ttthat's our best course of action?

<b>ttttLEMAY
</b>ttMr. President, I believe it is the only
ttcourse of action.  American is in
ttdanger.  Those missiles are a threat to
ttour bomber bases and the safety of our
ttnuclear deterrent.  Without our
ttdeterrent, there's nothing to keep the
ttenemy from choosing general nuclear war. 
ttIt's our duty, our responsibility to the
ttAmerican people to take out those
ttmissiles and return stability to the
ttstrategic situation.  The Big Red Dog is
ttdigging in our back yard, and we're
ttjustified in shooting him.

tTaylor steps in softly, smoothly: good cop to LeMay's bad.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttSir, we have a rapidly closing window of
ttopportunity where we can prevent those
ttmissiles from ever becoming operational. 
ttThe other options...

tHe spares a look at McNamara, who watches the fireworks, arms
tfolded, serious.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR (CONT'D)
</b>tt...do not guarantee the end result we
ttcan guarantee.  However, the more time
ttthat goes by, the less reliable the
ttchoice we can offer you becomes.

tThe President, partially defused, looks from Taylor to
tMcNamara.  LeMay steps forward, softer now, sincere.

<b>ttttLEMAY
</b>ttMr. President, the motto I chose for SAC
ttis 'Peace is our Profession.'  God
ttforbid we find ourselves in a nuclear
ttexchange.  But if launched, those
ttmissiles in Cuba would kill a lot of
ttAmericans.  That's why I'm being such a
ttpain in the ass about destroying them. 
ttDestroying them immediately.  Hell, even
ttMac agrees.

tBundy is uncomfortable.  Everyone turns to him.  He nods. 
tKenny realizes he's been co-opted by the military.  McNamara
tdoes too, lets out a deep breath.  The President eyes Bundy,
tthen paces out from behind his desk, walks up to LeMay.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttGeneral, what will the Soviets do when
ttwe attack?

<b>ttttLEMAY
</b>ttNothing.

tKenny, Bobby and the President look at each other, unable to
tbelieve what they just heard.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttNothing?

<b>ttttLEMAY
</b>ttNothing.  Because the only alternative
ttopen to them is one they can't choose.

tHis pronouncement hangs there in the air: ominous, dangerous.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttThose aren't just missiles we'll be
ttdestroying.  We kill Soviet soldiers,
ttand they will respond.  How would we
ttrespond if they killed ours?  No, they
ttwill do something, General, I promise
ttyou that.  And I believe it'll be
ttBerlin.

<b>tINT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tLeMay walk out of the Oval Office with Taylor, Carter and
ttheir staffers.

<b>ttttLEMAY
</b>ttThose goddamn Kennedys are going to
ttdestroy this country if we don't do
ttsomething about this.

tThere are dark looks on the faces of the other officers. 
tThey agree.

<b>tINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tAs the meeting next door disperses, the President rummages
tthrough Kenny's jacket which hangs on Kenny's chair.  Kenny,
tbemused, holds out the package of cigarettes the President is
tlooking for.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttI was hoping LeMay pushed you.  I
ttwouldn't mind going a few rounds with
tthim.

tThe President glances up, takes the proffered smokes.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttWe knew it was coming.  I tell you,
ttKenny, these brass hats have one big
ttadvantage.  We do what they want us to,
ttnone of us will be alive to tell 'em

tBobby, Rusk and Sorensen enter from the hall.

<b>ttttSORENSEN
</b>ttMr. President, Gromyko should be on his
ttway by now.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttWe need to go over what you're going to
ttsay.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttThere's still no sign they know that we
ttknow about the missiles.  Been a lot of

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttWe keep 'em in the dark as long as we
ttcan.  But I sure as hell am going to
tttest him.

<b>tINT. WEST WING HALL - DAY
</b>
tKenny comes out of the bathroom, and is buttonholed by the
tcrewcut, bullet-headed Press Secretary, PIERRE SALINGER, in
tthe crowded, busy hallway.

<b>ttttSALINGER
</b>ttKenny, I'm getting funny questions from
ttthe guys in the press office.  As Press
ttSecretary, I need to know.  What's going
tton?

tKenny wheels back into his office.  It's filled with people. 
tBut he bends confidentially to Pierre's ear.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThey're planning to shave you bald next
tttime you fall asleep on the bus.
ttt(off Pierre's get-serious look)
ttSorry, Pierre, Gromyko just arrived.

<b>tINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
tThe Press Corps throngs Kenny's tiny office, pushing and
tshoving for a vantage at the side door to the Oval Office,
twaiting for the Gromyko photo-op.  Kenny stands shoulder-to
tshoulder with Reston and Sorensen near the door.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttAre they going to discuss the military
ttexercises going on in Florida?

tKenny doesn't even blink, but Sorensen does a poorer job at
thiding his reaction.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttCome on, Scotty.  This meeting's been on
ttthe books for months.  It's just a
ttfriendly talk on U.S.-Soviet relations.

tFortunately, the conversation is cut short as a dozen
tFLASHBULBS suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the
treporters crush in on the Oval Office, and Reston is swept
tforward.

<b>tKENNY'S POV:
</b>
tover the reporters.  The President, unsmiling, enters the
troom beside Soviet Foreign Minister, ANDREI GROMYKO.  Gromyko
tpauses for the photos: grim, dark haired, saturnine.

<b>tRESUME
</b>
tKenny reacts.  At last, the face of the enemy.

<b>tINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tThe CAMERA picks up the darkened windows: the meeting has
tgone long.  The CAMERA MOVES PAST Kenny and Sorensen standing
tin the doorway to Kenny's office, FINDS the President in his
tchair across from Gromyko on the sofa.  Rusk, Ambassador
tANATOLY DOBRINYN, and two INTERPRETERS around them.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttSo that there should be no
ttmisunderstanding, the position of the
ttUnited States, which has been made clear
ttby the Attorney General to Ambassador
ttDobrynin here, I shall read a sentence
ttfrom my own statement to the press dated
ttSeptember 13th.
ttt(beat, reading)
ttShould missiles or offensive weapons be
ttplaced in Cuba, it would present the
ttgravest threat to U.S. national
ttsecurity.

tThe President stares at Gromyko as the translator finishes
ttranslating.  Gromyko sits there, enigmatic, cold,
tunreadable.  The translator finishes, and Gromyko stops him
twith a gesture so he can answer in his own accented English.

<b>ttttGROMYKO
</b>ttMr. President, this will never be done. 
ttYou need not be concerned.

tThe President hides his fury masterfully, and gazing over his
tglasses, asks:

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttSo I do not misunderstand you: there are
ttno offensive weapons in Cuba.

tA beat.  And Gromyko's response is flat, sure, steady:

<b>ttttGROMYKO
</b>ttNo, Mr. President.  We have sent
ttdefensive weapons only to Cuba.

tKenny's blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of
tGromyko's head.  His gaze swings to the PRESIDENT'S DESK.

tBENEATH THE DESK sit the BRIEFING BOARDS with the evidence.

<b>tINT. WEST WING HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tKenny emerges from his office.  The Soviet delegation
tdisappears down the hallway with Rusk.  Kenny turns as Bobby,
thaggard, comes up from the other direction.

tBobby gestures to the vanishing delegation, now being
tHARANGUED OC by the press.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWhat happened?

tThe President comes out of the next door down the hall, the
tOval Office.  He turns and sees Kenny and Bobby.  He's livid.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttLying bastard.  Lied to my face.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWe're split down the middle.  If I held
tta vote I think airstrike would beat
ttblockade by a vote or two.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttI want a consensus, Bobby.  Consensus. 
ttEither air strike or blockade. 
ttSomething everyone'll stand by even if
ttthey don't like it.  I need it by
ttSaturday.  Make it happen.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWhat if I can't?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWe go into this split, the Russians will
ttknow it.  And they'll use it against us.

tThe prospect disturbs the three men.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttHave you cancelled Chicago and the rest
ttof the weekend yet?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttYou don't show for Chicago, everyone'll
ttknow there's something going on.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttI don't care.  Cancel it.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttNo way.

tThe President spins on him, unsure he heard correctly.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>ttI'm not calling and cancelling on Daly. 
ttYou call and cancel on Daly.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttYou're scared to cancel on Daly.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttDamn right I'm scared.

tThe President pauses, looks at Bobby.  Bobby shakes his head:
tdon't look at me.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttWell, I'm not.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttThen you'll call, right?

<b>tINT. HALLWAY - SHERATON-BLACKSTONE HOTEL - NIGHT

</b>
<b>tTHEN SUPER: CHICAGO
</b>
tKenny threads his way through the host of SECRET SERVICE
tAGENTS and ADVANCE MAN cramming the hallway on the floor of
tthe hotel they've taken over.  From one of the rooms emerges
tSalinger.

<b>ttttSALINGER
</b>ttKenny, all right.  What's going on here? 
ttThere's rumors going around an exercise
ttin the southeast is related to Cuba. 
ttI'm the Press Secretary.  I can't do my

ttwhat's going on?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWhat are you telling them?

<b>ttttSALINGER
</b>ttThe truth: I don't know.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttt(deadly serious)
ttTell 'em you've looked into it, and all
ttit is is an exercise.  And Pierre --
ttt(beat, loaded)
ttThe President may have a cold tomorrow.

tKenny stares at him, and the light dawns on Pierre. 
tSomething big is going on and he's been cut out of it.  He
tstalks off.

<b>ttttSALINGER
</b>ttDamn it, Kenny.  Goddamn it!

<b>tINT. RECEPTION HALL - SHERATON-BLACKSTONE - NIGHT
</b>
tA big 100-dollar-a-plate dinner is in full swing to a dinner
tband's tunes.  The President and Chicago MAYOR RICHARD DALY
tmake the rounds among the fund raising CROWD.  Kenny follows
tthem at a respectful distance, greeting old cronies.

tSuddenly a MESSENGER hustles over to Kenny, hands him a note. 
tKenny makes eye contact with the President, nods and leaves.

<b>tINT. HOTEL ELEVATORS - NIGHT
</b>
tKenny waits at the elevator.  Scotty saunters up behind him. 
tHe sizes Kenny up, clears his throat.  Kenny turns around.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttThere are major rail disruptions in the
ttSouth, two airborne divisions are on
ttalert.  That exercise is an invasion.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWell, you know how Bobby has it in for

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttThis is about Cuba.

tKenny freezes, then explodes.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttCuba?  You're fucking crazy.  We are not
ttinvading Cuba.  Nobody gives a rat's ass
ttabout Cuba.  Not now, not ever. 
ttIf you print something like that, all
ttyou're going to do is inflame the
ttsituation.  Nobody talks to assholes who
ttinflame situations.  Assholes like that
ttcan find themselves cut out of the loop.

tReston is taken aback.  Stung silence for a beat.  Kenny's
tresponse is far louder than any "yes."  Now Kenny realizes
tit.

<b>ttttRESTON
</b>ttYou've never threatened me before.

tAnd Kenny looks away, upset, but when he turns back to
tReston, all that's there is his poker face.  The elevator
tarrives.

<b>ttttRESTON (CONT'D)
</b>ttAll right.  I'm not going to print
ttanything until I have another source. 
ttBut I promise you, I'll get one.

tKenny boards the elevator.  The doors shut on Scotty.

tThe President emerges from the hotel, a HAT on his head.  The
tPress and a CROWD surge forward, crying out for the
tPresident's attention.  Kenny slides into the limo first as
tthe President waves to the crowd.

tSalinger waits on the sidewalk, and after the limo pulls
taway, the Press pushes in on him.  Pierre's face is pale -
the's just been told everything.

</b>ttThe President has a cold.  He is

ttand is returning to Washington on the

<b>tINT. WHITE HOUSE MANSION - OVAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe White House Oval ROOM: opulent, filled with priceless art
tand furniture, but cramped.  EXCOM members crowd around the
tcenter coffee table and the President.  Kenny stands behind
thim with Bobby.  Rusk rises from his seat, formal.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttMr. President, our deliberations have
ttled us to the conclusion that, for the
ttmoment, a blockade of offensive weapons
ttto Cuba is our best option.  But we'll
ttstill need a strong showing of support
ttfrom the Organization of American States
ttto give us an umbrella of legitimacy.

tAt long last... Kenny looks at Bobby, relieved.  They've
tbought time to find a settlement.  Bobby smiles a small
tsmile: what were you so worried about?

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttA blockade is technically an act of war,
tttherefore we recommend calling the

<b>tINT. WHITE HOUSE MANSION - OVAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tThe President.  He listens, looks over the briefing papers as
tMcNamara continues.  Everyone watches the President.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttA quarantine prevents more missiles from
ttreaching Cuba, but it doesn't remove the
ttones already there.  It gives the
ttSoviets a chance to pull back without
ttwar.  If they refuse to remove the
ttmissiles before they're operational, we
ttretain the option to strike or invade.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWe believe that a surprise attack would
ttbe counter to what the United States
ttstands for.  We believe that an attack
ttleaves us no room for maneuver, and the
ttinevitable Soviet response will force us
ttinto a war we do not want.  A war that,
ttthis time, will really end all war.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttMr. President, there are still those of
ttus who believe we should proceed with
ttthe strikes.  With the blockade, we lose
ttstrategic surprise and we run the risk
ttof a first strike if the Soviets decide
ttthey have to use the missiles or lose
ttthem.

tThe President gazes from one expectant face to another.  But
the himself remains unreadable.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttQuarantine or air strike.

tAdlai clears his throat.  Everyone looks over at him.  He
tstares down at his clasped hands for a beat.  He's anguished
tabout what he's going to say.

<b>ttttADLAI
</b>ttThere is a third option.  With either
ttcourse we undertake the risk of nuclear
ttwar.  It seems to me maybe one of us in
tthere should be a coward.

tHe smiles weakly, but gets no response from anyone.

<b>ttttADLAI (CONT'D)
</b>ttSo I guess I'll be.  Our third choice is
ttto cut a deal.  We trade Guantanamo and
ttour missiles in Turkey, get them to pull
tttheir missiles out.  We employ a back
ttchannel, attribute the idea to U Thant. 
ttU Thant then raises it at the U.N.

tAdlai looks for support around the room, but meets only stony
tgazes.  From McCone and General Taylor, contempt.  Dead
tsilence for a long, long beat.

tKenny's heart goes out to Stevenson as he watches the man
tcommit political suicide.  Even Sorensen, standing behind
thim, unconsciously moves away.  At last the President speaks.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttI don't think that's possible, Adlai.

ttI will be asking the networks for air

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttSomebody had to say it.  I respect Adlai

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWe have to pull him.  He's not going to

ttof the U.N.  Zorin will eat him alive.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttWe've got bigger problems right now.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWe have to try the blockades.  It
ttprobably won't work.  It may just be

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttI don't know.  I don't know.

tThe President sits nearby, head bowed.  But Kenny knows he's
tnot thinking about the mass.  And when the President at last
tlifts his head, Kenny sees the calm poise.

tThe President has made up his mind...

tKenny, Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Bundy and half of EXCOM stand
tto the side of the room.  General Sweeney and LeMay stand in
tfront of the President's desk.

tThe President, bowed in the window, is care-worn, a thousand
tyears old.  The shadow, the composition of the SHOT tells us
tall.  It's down to what's in the heart of one man.  Kenny is
tdeeply moved at his friend's Gethsemane.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttCam, can you guarantee me you'll get all

tSweeney glances at LeMay.  LeMay's stern, frozen look wills
thim to say, very simply, "yes."

tBut then the President turns around, looks Sweeney in the

t-- carrying us over the aircraft's wing.  The CAMERA pivots
tand the vast war machine crawls away underneath joining --

</b>
tThe CAMERA races toward a spotlighted concrete emplacement,
tover the immense BLAST DOOR which is sliding open, and DOWN --

t-- into the depths of a missile silo.  The CAMERA speeds down
tthe side of the Titan missile, through CLOUDS of steaming
tliquid hydrogen, past FUELING HOSES which clamp one by one to

thurtles all the way to the bottom, SMASHING THROUGH THE FLOOR

tThe carrier's SIREN begins a lonely, eerie WOOP WOOP WOOP
tWOOP like some immense creature which has lost its mind.  The

tThe doors to the Cabinet room.  A beat.  Then they SWING
tWIDE.  The President emerges, livid fury on his face, leaving

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (V.O.)
</b>tt...unmistakable evidence has now
ttestablished the fact that a series of

t-- AND DROWNING OUT the President's speech as the plane
tlurches forward, down the runway into the night.

</b>ttTherefore, in the defense of our own

</b>tt-- on all offensive military equipment
ttunder shipment to Cuba is being
ttinitiated.  All ships of any kind bound
ttfor Cuba, if found to contain cargoes of

ttSecond: I have directed the continued

tA beat.  And the President looks up from his notes.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttAnd third: it shall be the policy of
ttthis nation to regard any nuclear
ttmissile launched from Cuba against any
ttnation in the Western Hemisphere as an
ttattack by the Soviet Union on the United
ttStates, requiring a full retaliatory
ttresponse upon the Soviet Union...

tThe chilling words hang there in the air.  BLEEDING IN: the
trising and falling WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP which becomes --

<b>tEXT. CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT
</b>
t-- the voice of the Essex battlegroup: sparkling, alive, a
tconstellation of lights scattered across the sea.  One by one
tthe escort ships answer the carrier's SIREN with their own
twailing cries, an alien chorus among the ships, disappearing
tand reappearing in the swells.  The communication crescendos
tto its fever pitch --

t-- and then the battlegroup goes to blackout.  Like a dying
tuniverse, the answering sirens cut off, the life-lights wink
tout, and an appalling darkness falls across the sea...

</b>ttWhich is exactly what they appear to be

ttby this time tomorrow.

tEcker doesn't want to be avenged with atomic weapons.  No

<b>ttttKENNY (V.O.)
</b>ttI've known the man for fifteen years. 
ttThe problem is, he will protect you.  So
ttI'm asking: don't make him protect you. 
ttDon't get shot at.

tEcker down, deeply affected.  Suddenly, A BELL RINGS.  A

<b>ttttECKER
</b>ttOkay, Mr. O'Donnell.  We'll do what we
ttcan.

</b>
tAs Ecker hangs up, the Duty Officer rips off the ORDERS,
thands them to Ecker, who takes one look, then gazes out the
twindow at the runway --

<b>tEXT. RUNWAY - KEY WEST NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY
</b>
tA CART speeds down the flight line past the waiting F8U-1P
tCorsairs.  One by one, the four pilots accompanying Ecker and
tWilhemy jump off to mount their planes.  The cart still
tmoving.

<b>ttttECKER
</b>ttGet that fuel assayed?

<b>ttttWILHEMY
</b>ttYeah.  It sucks.  Ain't for high
ttperformance babies like ours.  Shoulda
ttbrought some from home, but what can you
ttdo?  Last-second deployments...

tWilhemy jumps off, then they're at Ecker's plane, and he
tjumps off.  Too late to worry about bad fuel now.  He hoists
thimself up and into the cockpit of the sleek navy jet.

<b>ttINT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - DAY
</b>
tAs the canopy closes, Ecker powers up the engines, talks to
this flight over the Guard channel.

<b>ttttECKER
</b>ttOkay, time to play Spin the Bottle with
ttour bearded buddy.  Nobody gets out
ttahead.  Remember, just sitting here
ttwe're only ten minutes from target.

<b>tEXT. RUNWAY - DAY
</b>
tThe Crusaders swing around in pairs at one end of the runway,
tand then the first two throttle-up, flaps down, and drop
ttheir brakes.  The machines LUNGE forward like duelling drag
tracers.  The FILL THE SCREEN, blow past.

<b>tEXT. AERIAL - OVER KEY WEST - DAY
</b>
tThe six Crusaders, in pairs, streak over the buildings and
tstreets of Key West.  And in a heartbeat, cross the beach and
tare out to sea.

tAnd already on the horizon, the low clouds and dark line of
tland.  Cuba.  Ninety miles away.

<b>tINT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - DAY
</b>
tThe ocean shrieks past so close you can see the white foam. 
tEcker checks the altimeter: 150 FEET.

tA small fishing boat looms ahead, its net booms reaching up
tlike tree limbs.  The Crusader rockets over it.

tEcker checks his instruments.  OUT THE WINDOW, the other
tCrusaders thunder over the water, past sailboats, cabin
tcruisers, the small-craft traffic outside Key West.  The
tspeed sucks the breath away.

<b>ttttECKER
</b>ttGo to military throttle on my mark. 
ttThree...two...one... mark.

tHis airspeed indicator spins up to 400 knots.  And then his

tplanes streak over the ocean.  There are no more small craft
tthis far out in the strait.

<b>tINT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - DAY
</b>
tCuba, green and hazy, looms in the window.  Ecker throws a
tseries of switches.

<b>ttttECKER
</b>ttStart your camera checks.

tA mechanical WHINE accompanies the switch-throwing.  Ecker
tpulls the trigger on his joystick and a THUMP THUMP THUMP
thammers away.  There are green lights across his boards.

tOne of the other pilots cuts in on the radio:

<b>ttttPILOT #3 (O.S.)
</b>ttFailure.  All cameras.  Sonofabitch. 
ttFilm must not have fed.

ttStill with me, Bruce?

<b>ttttWILHEMY (O.S.)
</b>ttThat's affirm.

tThe two Crusaders who've failed their camera checks break
toff.  And now Cuba's hills, the Havana sky line are right in
tfront of them.

<b>tEXT. CUBAN BEACH - CONTINUOUS

tThe planes dip and rise with the green tropical contours,
ttaking us on a sickening roller-coaster ride over Cuban

tAnd then, ahead, a large clearing.

tCuban ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNNERS shout as they traverse their 40mm

taircraft guns open up.

<b>ttttWILHEMY
</b>ttHoly shit!

</b>
tTracers and flack pepper the air in front of Ecker's
tCrusader.  METAL PINGS, TINKS, RATTLES off the fuselage. 
tAnti-aircraft and small arms fire comes up from all over,
thitting the planes multiple times.  He surveys the shapes in
tthe target zone dead ahead.

<b>ttttECKER
</b>ttLights.

tAnd sees the long, canvas-covered objects on the ground.  The
tmissiles.  They draw closer.

tbegin banging away like cannons.

<b>tEXT. AERIAL - CRUSADERS - DAY
</b>
tTRACERS lace the air between the two planes as they blast
tover the missile site.  Over trailers.  Over tents.  Over
ttrucks.  Over trenches.  Over bulldozers.

tAnd then they're out over forest again.  It's all over in
tseconds.  The triple-A stops.  In unison, the two planes bank
tright, heading for the distant blue, blue sea.

<b>tINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

tKenny paces by the phone.  It rings.  He picks up, listens,
treacts.  Relief.  And we know the planes have made it back.

<b>tEXT. RUNWAY - CECIL FIELD, FLA. - DAY

tEcker jumps down from the cockpit ladder and turns an eye to
this battered, pock-marked plane.  Wilhemy and the GROUND CREW

<b>ttttGROUND CREW CHIEF
</b>ttLookit what daddy done brung home.

<b>ttttWILHEMY
</b>ttYou shoulda seen it, Chief, they --

ttHow many did you hit, Bruce?

tWilhemy stands there, looking at Ecker, not sure what to make
tof him.  The Crew Chief just starts laughing as more
timpressed GROUND CREW come up.

<b>ttttWILHEMY
</b>ttA few.  I guess.

<b>ttttGROUND CREW CHIEF
</b>ttWas them 20 or 40 million sparrows?

tEcker, sweat-plastered and foul, steps into the Chief's face.

<b>ttttECKER
</b>ttThose are bird strikes.  Sparrows to be
ttprecise.  Got a problem with that?

tThe Chief stands there, glances at the plane one more time,
tand shakes his head, 'No.'  Ecker takes the Chief's
tmaintenance clipboard from him, writes in big bold marker:
tBIRD STRIKES.  He thrusts it back into the Chief's hands and
twalks off; the astonished Wilhemy remains behind.

<b>tINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

tAnd then he breaks into a huge grin.  Everyone cheers him.

tthrough a doorway.  A sign over it reads JCS.

</b>ttAll right.  Then I guess it's time.

<b>tINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

tFLASHBULBS go off all around the room as the President walks

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttIn accordance with this afternoon's vote

<b>tINT. WEST WING HALLS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tKenny makes his way through the dim, deserted halls. 
tSomewhere in the distance a phone rings.  He reaches a door.

<b>tEXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
tKenny, bundled in an overcoat, steps outside the North

tPennsylvania Avenue beyond it, seeming to isolate this world
tfrom the living city beyond.  He starts for the main gate.

<b>tEXT. MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tA WHITE HOUSE POLICE OFFICER jumps up as Kenny approaches.

<b>ttttPOLICE OFFICER

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttHow long will it take to get someone up?

</b>ttFifteen minutes, maybe.  To your house,

tbut...

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttNo.  No, I'll let her sleep.  Let 'em

tKenny says it with a certain finality.  The Police Officer
tnods, and Kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering
tthe weight of the world.

<b>tEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
tKenny makes his way down a sidewalk not far from the White
tHouse.  A 24-hour drug store's doors are open.  He pauses.

tInside, a knot of PEOPLE - late-night deliverymen, a cop, the
tstore employees - talk in undertones at the counter.  Behind
tit, a T.V. is signing off with the national anthem.  Sober
tvoices, sober looks.  Kenny moves on.

<b>tEXT. NEWS STAND - NIGHT
</b>
tA cluster of COLLEGE STUDENTS talk at a news stand.  They're
twaiting for the NEWSIE to cut the bands of the next day's
tWashington Post, the bundles just being thrown to the
tsidewalk from the delivery truck.  Kenny approaches.

tIn their thing beards, counter-culture clothes, the kids seem
tso young, Kenny so old.  Kenny buys a newspaper, its dire
theadlines, every story about the crisis.

<b>tEXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NIGHT
</b>
tKenny, newspaper under his arm, continues down the street. 
tUp ahead, the lights are on in a Catholic Church.  Lines of
tCHURCHGOERS are at the door.  Kenny stops, surprised at the
tsight this late.  And then he sees the hand-painted banner:
<b>tCONFESSIONS 24 HOURS.  PRAY FOR PEACE.
</b>
tKenny is moved.  He glances over his shoulder, and then...
tjoins the line himself.

<b>tINT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

</b>
tKenny, standing just inside the open doors to the White House
tSituation Room, a state-of-the-art conference room.  A long,
tcentral table surrounded by leather chairs with phones and
tscreens built in.  T.V. monitors hang from the ceilings in
tthe corners.  There are no windows, just oppressive bunker
tlike walls.  It's far underground.

tAcross the room the President paces, phone in hand.  Half of
tEXCOM is in their seats.  The other half, along with a steady
tstream of DUTY OFFICERS, are coming and going.  Kenny steps
taside for a Duty Officer, listens to the President.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT

tA large, elaborate war room, like Mission Control.  Big

tat the center of the room projects a map of the Caribbean and
tAtlantic.  Arcing across it is a RED LINE: the blockade.

tThe map is covered with cryptic military notations; WATCH
tOFFICERS on a platform which swings out over it update the

</b>ttThen it looks like our first customers

tHe nods to Admiral Anderson, who calls an order down to a

<b>ttttMCNAMARA (O.S.)
</b>ttI'm afraid not, Mr. President.  The sub

tAll around the room frustration.  Bobby shakes his head. 
tKenny sinks back in his chair.  The President hesitates.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttPut me through to the Pierce.

<b>tINT. FLAG PLOT - DAY

tAdmiral Anderson nods to a COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER.  The man
tmakes the connection on a switchboard.

tMcNamara casts an eye to the map.  The two red MARKERS

ttBob, where's that coming from!

<b>ttttMCNAMARA (O.S.)
</b>ttJust a second, Mr. President.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttWill somebody find out what's going on?!

tMcCone jumps up, leaves the room.  The President looks at
tKenny, tense.  Everyone holds their breath.

<b>ttttRUSK

tcircling the Soviet ships, marking them DEAD IN THE WATER.

thand.  Rusk and Bundy slap each other on the back.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttWe were eyeball to eyeball and I think
ttthe other fellow just blinked.

tThe ruckus goes on for a minute.  McCone comes back in.

</b>ttMr. President.

tHis voice is lost in the celebration.  McCone calls out:

</b>ttMr. President!

tThe hubub dies away.

<b>ttttMCCONE (CONT'D)
</b>ttSir, we have the tally from NSA.  We
tthave twenty ships stopping and or
ttturning around.  Six, however, appear to
ttbe continuing for the line.  Including
ttthe Gagarin and Kimovsk.

tThe elation goes out of the room.  Kenny looks at the
tPresident.  The President picks up the phone again.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttCaptain, have the ships you're observing
ttchanged course?

<b>ttttCAPTAIN (O.S.)
</b>ttNo, Mr. President.  They've just crossed
ttthe quarantine line.

tBobby grips the edge of the table, immediately believing.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttIt's an accident.  They must not have
ttgotten their orders yet.  Let 'em go.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttUnlikely, Mr. President.  We've been
ttmonitoring transmissions from both the
ttGagarin and Kimovsk.  Their radios are
ttworking fine.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttOne ship, an accident maybe.  Six: this
ttis intentional.

tThe President looks to Bobby.  He has no answer.  Kenny's
tmind races over the variables, and he leans forward, intense,
tsuddenly understanding in a flash of insight:

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThey're right.  This is intentional.

tHe glances around the room.  All of EXCOM is looking at him. 
tBobby stares at Kenny, too shocked to feel betrayed.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>ttKhruschev's stopped the 20 ships which
ttare carrying contraband, and he's
ttletting the ones which aren't go
ttthrough, hoping for an incident.  I
ttthink we should let them go.

tBobby relaxes.  Around the table there are nods.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttIf we do, it erodes the credibility of
ttthe quarantine.  He'll just send more
ttthrough tomorrow.

tThe President looks at Kenny.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThen we deal with it tomorrow.  But
tttoday he's stopped most of them.  He's
ttdone something smart here.  We gave him
ttan ultimatum, and he's agreed to most of
ttit, preserving just enough room to save

tBobby's nodding, following the argument.  Kenny looks around
tthe room for support.

<b>ttINT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

tMcNamara, pacing on the phone, jumps in.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttMr. President, I agree.  Let them go. 
ttFour of the six continuing ships are
ttstill a day away from the line.  They've
ttstopped all the ones we suspect have
ttweapons aboard. 
ttIt would look bad shooting up a
ttfreighter full of baby food.

<b>tINT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tThe President holds Kenny's gaze, then lifts the phone.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttCaptain, I want you to maintain contact
ttwith those ships.  Do nothing until I
ttorder otherwise.  Is that clear?

<b>ttttCAPTAIN (O.S.)
</b>ttYes, Mr. President.  Contact only.

tHe hangs up, turns to Kenny.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttI hope you're right.

<b>tEXT. SOUTH LAWN - DAY
</b>
tKenny, Bobby and the President make their way across the
tlawn, out of earshot of the building.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWhat happened to speak when spoken to?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttGive it a rest.  You were thinking the
ttsame thing, just didn't have the guts to
tttake the heat.

tBobby likes getting under Kenny's skin.  Bobby aims a punch
tat his head which Kenny knocks away.  The President changes
tgear, serious.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttWe can horsetrade with Khruschev on
ttships.  But it doesn't get us any closer
ttto removing those missiles.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttHave to hope it's a signal that he'll
ttback down on the real issue too.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWe're going to have to stop a ship
tteventually, show the quarantine's got
ttteeth, or we'll prove McCone right.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttMcNamara's on his way back here now.  We
ttneed to pick the right ship.  No subs. 
ttNo armed boarding parties either.  We
ttneed a little more time to figure this
ttone out.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThen let's move the quarantine line.

tIt's a simple suggestion.  The President considers him a
tbeat, and then McNamara emerges from the White House, heads
tfor them.  The three friends assume their more reserved,
tpolitical faces as he comes up.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttMr. President.  Bobby.  Kenny.  The
ttEssex battle group has the Gagarin,
ttKimovsk and the sub escort under their
ttthumb.  We've got a few hours now before
ttwe need to worry about any more
ttflashpoints on the line.
ttt(beat)
ttWe could use a few more hours.  I think
ttwe should consider moving the quarantine
ttline back to 500 miles.

tBobby and the President look at Kenny like he's some kind of
tSvengali.  Kenny just stands there, poker faced.

<b>tINT. WEST WING - DAY
</b>
tKenny and McNamara enter the White House from the South Lawn. 
tThey stride down the hall, side by side.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttMoving the line.  Stroke of genius.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttt(snappish)
ttOf course it is.  But the President
ttneeds to realize we're going to have to
ttstop a ship eventually.

tThey turn a corner, silence for a beat.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThe Chiefs are looking for a provocation
ttout there.  The President's going to
ttcome under enormous pressure.  You have
ttto keep 'em on a short leash, Bob.

tMcNamara spares Kenny a short, nasty look.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttYou must think I'm blind and stupid. 
ttI've already gotten the birds and bees
ttfrom Bobby.  The President doesn't have
ttto double-barrel me.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttListen to me, goddamn it.  We're talking
ttabout a possible nuclear war.  You
ttdropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>tt-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't
ttdrop --

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttYou were in the room.  It was your
ttpurview.  It was your job to make sure
ttBissel wasn't fucking us over and you
ttdidn't do it.  You've got the most
ttimportant job in the world right now. 
ttYou're the smartest guy the President
tthas.
ttt(beat)
ttBesides me.

tThat gets an amused snort from McNamara, breaking the
ttension.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttAnybody ever tell you you're an
ttegomaniac and a prick, O'Donnell?

tKenny stares him in the eye, serious, hushed.  A friend.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttYou need to be the best you've ever
ttbeen.

tMcNamara enters the elevator.  He turns, stands there facing
tKenny for a dramatic beat.  Then the doors close.

ttto 500 miles.

<b>tPULL BACK, REVEALING:
</b>
tKenny watching the T.V., is yelling at the phone.

</b>ttFind out how close our exercises are

tthave an answer for me or I will come

ttt(beat)
ttThen you can press charges, and I'll get
tta Presidential pardon.

tHe hangs up, hears SHOUTING from the Oval Office.  He goes to
tthe door, enters --

<b>tINT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
t-- and sees the President leaning over his desk, jabbing his
tfinger at General Taylor.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT

ttI'm going to have Power's head on a
ttplatter next to LeMay's!
ttt(noticing Kenny)
ttHey, Kenny, did you hear me give the

ttgiving the order to go to DEFCON 3, but
ttI must be suffering from amnesia because
ttI've just been informed our nuclear
ttforces are DEFCON 2!

tKenny realizes he's not joking as he spots Bobby sitting on
tthe couch behind Taylor, pale as a ghost.  Taylor, embattled,
twants to die, but stands there like a man.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttTechnically, General LeMay is correct
ttthat SAC has the statutory authority --

tThe President punches his desk.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>tt-- I have the authority.  I am the
ttcommander-in-chief of the United States,
ttand I say when we go to war!

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttWe are not at war, sir, not until we're
ttat DEFCON 1.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttGeneral, the Joint Chiefs have just
ttsignalled our intent to escalate to the

ttescalation which I had no wish to
ttsignal, and which I did not approve.  

tBut Taylor knows this very well.  And the way he's suffering,
tit's clear he's taking the heat for his underlings.  From
tover on the couch Bobby chimes in:

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttLeMay... he's history.

tThe President glances at Kenny who stands there, speechless.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttGet out of here, Max.

tThe General leaves.  Kenny closes the door, wanders deeper
tinto the office.  He looks from the President to Bobby. 
tThere's a long, long beat of shocked silence.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttJesus...

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttRescind the order.  Can all the Chiefs. 
ttPut Nitze, Gilpatric and the
ttUndersecretaries in charge.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWe can't do that, Bobby.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttHe's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. 
ttThe Soviets will think we've gotten
ttsweet on them.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttAnd we can't purge the Chiefs.  Our

ttOr even that there's been an attempted

</b>ttMcNamara won't be able to handle them. 
ttIt's too much for one man...
ttt(knowing look to Kenny)
tt...with all due respect to our heroic

tThe President collapses in his rocking chair.  Kenny leans
tover the back of the sofa next to Bobby.

</b>ttWe've got Khruschev's attention with the

tBobby looks at the President, meaningful.  The President
tturns to Kenny.

this, looks away from Kenny a beat.

</b>ttWhat did you think of Lippman's column
ttthis morning?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttI think it's a bad idea.

tBundy turns back to him.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttThank God.  Look, everyone is furious
ttabout it.  We trade away our missiles in

tKenny grinds his jaw, but doesn't say anything.  He agrees. 
tBundy steps up to him, confiding.

<b>ttttBUNDY (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou gotta stop 'em.  We know it's Jack

</b>ttOh, just a bunch of crap about

ton his own papers.

<b>ttttZORIN
</b>ttThe United States has no facts in hand. 
ttFalsity is what America has in its hands
tt- false evidence.

tZorin leans back in his chair.  Adlai finally looks up.  He
tmeets Zorin's icy bravura.  He notes the cameras around the
troom.  This is the grandest stage of all.

</b>ttThe chair recognizes the representative

tAnd in that moment, Adlai becomes the spokesman for America.

</b>ttWell, let me say something to you, Mr.

tthrough the various delegations.

ttheard you correctly, you now say they do
ttnot exist.

tZorin, headphones on, listens to his own translation, but
tdoesn't respond, acts bored.  It gets Adlai's goat, and he
tbegins to lose his cool.  A rumble from the U.N.  The CAMERA
tFINDS Adlai's hand SHAKING, gripping his pen.

</b>ttAll right, sir.  Let me ask you one

ttor no - don't wait for the translation -

tThere's laughter at Zorin's refusal to be bullied: but it's
tnervous laughter, not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete-a

tAdlai presses on.

</b>ttAnd I'm prepared to present the evidence

tAnd Zorin cracks.  He looks uneasily to his delegation.  They
tbend forward to consult.  Adlai sits back in his chair,
tdraping his arms over its wings with the confidence of
tsomeone who knows he's kicked ass.

tAdlai looks around the room while he's waiting for his
tanswer, managing not to smile.  The diplomatic world is
tscandalized.  At last Zorin regroups, lifts his head from his
thuddle.

tlooks like the biggest fool in the world.

</b>
tA G-d-like view of the flag plot, covered with HUNDREDS OF

</b>
tMcNamara stares out at the bewildering tangle of symbols,
tliving men behind each one.  Each tangle of red and blue
tsymbols a powderkeg.  A G-dlike view indeed.  And it is far
tmore than any one mere man could keep control of. And he
tbegins to realize it.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttWe're kidding ourselves...

tAnd not only that, in his bleary, sleep-deprived fog, he
tbegins to understand something happening down there.

tThe CAMERA MOVES over the enormous map, over the scrolling
tcryptic numerology.  THE BUZZ of radio communications bleeds
tin from the background.  The overhead platform swivels on its
tmotor, like the vast arm of some fate-writing god as the
tWatch Officer on it updates the movements of the ships.

tMcNamara stares, at the verge of grasping something.  Through
tthe door-crack of genius, he has the glimpse of some grander
tthing, some grander design.

<b>ttttADMIRAL ANDERSON
</b>ttVery well.  Load your guns.

tThat starts McNamara from his fatigued reverie.  He goes to
tthe railing, looks down on Anderson.

tAnderson turns, gazes up from his tier below, distracted.

<b>ttttADMIRAL ANDERSON
</b>ttWe've been hailing the Groznyy for the

ttIf you don't mind, we're very busy right

</b>ttWe're going to follow the Rules of

tThe Destroyer's forward 5-inch twin guns swivel, train on the

tBAMBAM, ripping the air in front of the muzzles, the Groznyy
tso close a miss isn't possible.

tThe Destroyer's guns hammer away at the Groznyy, at point
tblank range... but the Groznyy IS UNHARMED.  

tSuddenly, in the air above it appear BRILLIANT FLARES.  They
tlight up the ship, brighter than the sun.  The destroyer
tisn't firing deadly rounds... it's firing harmless
tstarshells.

</b>ttThat ship was firing starshells. 
ttStarshells.  Flares, Mr. Secretary.

tEveryone's eyes are on the two men.  Only the chatter of

tlooks down at the plot on the floor.  Anderson's voice drops
tto a deadly sotto.

</b>ttGet out of our way, Mr. Secretary.  The

tMcNamara turns back.  And all trepidation, embarrassment,

ttthat there would be no firing on ships
ttwithout his express permission.  

<b>ttttADMIRAL ANDERSON
</b>ttWith all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we

ttwere not attacking the ship.  We were
ttfiring over it.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA

tHe passes his hand over the enormous plot below.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA (CONT'D)
</b>ttThis isn't a blockade.

tMcNamara, trembling with anger, awe, whirls to Anderson.  And
this burgeoning insight is born - clear, hard and cold.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA (CONT'D)
</b>ttThis, all this, is language, a new
ttvocabulary the likes of which the world
tthas never seen. 
ttThis is President Kennedy communicating
ttwith Secretary Khruschev.

tMcNamara JABS HIS FINGER OUT AT the plot, and --

</b>ttDangle a settlement, tie us down in

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttMr. President, we're receiving a letter
ttfrom Khruschev over at State.

<b>tINT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - STATE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tFrom a cluster of folding metal chairs, Kenny, Bobby, Rusk
tand Sorensen watch a TELETYPE hammer out the message as it
tcomes off the wire.  It's painfully slow, like watching a bad
ttypist type a manuscript.  Ten pages of this is an eternity. 
tTo top it off, it's in Russian.  A TRANSLATOR reads it off,
tword by word to a TRANSCRIBER.

<b>ttttTRANSLATOR
</b>tt...two...of...us...pull...on...the...
ttknot...of...war...

<b>tINT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tKenny slams a page of Khruschev's letter on the table.  He
tjabs his finger at it.  EXCOM listens, intent.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttIt's ten pages of sentimental fluff, but
tthe's saying right here.  He'll remove
ttthe missiles in return for a no-invasion
ttpledge.  It looks like Fomin's overture
ttwas genuine.

tThe President turns to McCone.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttOur early analysis says this was
ttprobably written by Khruschev himself. 
ttIt's a first draft, and shows no signs
ttof being polished by the foreign
ttministry.  In fact, it probably hasn't
ttbeen approved by the Politburo.  They
ttwouldn't have let the emotionalism go
ttby.  The analysts say it was written by
ttsomeone under considerable stress.

tEXCOM chuckles.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttGlad to hear we're not alone.

tThe President eyes the EXCOM members one by one, an incipient
tsmile on his face.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttWell, gentlemen, I wasn't planning on
ttinvading Cuba anyway.  I think we can
ttlive with the terms of this deal.

tThere are mostly nods of assent, big smiles around the table. 
tExcept from  McCone and Taylor.  The President takes his copy
tof the letter, flips through it.  He shakes his head, almost
tunable to believe that Khruschev has given in.  A long beat.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttTed, I want you to draft our acceptance.

<b>tEXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tA long, black car stops at the end of Kenny's driveway.  The
tdoor opens, and Kenny steps out.  He says an inaudible
tgoodnight to the driver, and the car pulls off.  He turns,
tfacing the white two-story house with the neat front yard,
tthe lights out.  And he smiles.  Home at last.

<b>tEXT. O'DONNELL PATIO - NIGHT
</b>
tA screen door squeaks open.  Kenny steps out into the
tdarkness of the back yard.  And there, in her robe, sitting
tstartled on a lawn chair, lit only by the dim glow of the
tkitchen window, is Helen.  Kenny stands there tired, his coat
tslung over his shoulder.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttHi.

tHelen rises, her own care-worn face turned to his.  For a
tsilent moment they gaze at each other, searching in the lines
tof each others' face for the changes of a long separation. 
tThey see them.  But they've been married a long time, and the
tawkwardness passes.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttHi, O'Donnell.  You look old.

tKenny drops his coat on a table as Helen comes up and folds
therself into his arms.

<b>ttttHELEN (CONT'D)
</b>ttThis job's going to kill you.  If I
ttdon't first.

tThey kiss, comfortable.  But not too long, and he lets her
tgo.  She looks at him again, sees he's suppressing a smile.

<b>ttttHELEN (CONT'D)
</b>ttIf you're home it means either Jack and

ttcon man you are and fired you, or --

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>tt-- we got a back channel communication
ttfrom Khruschev this evening feeling us

tKenny, in his overcoat, steps aside as a pair of Duty
tOfficers race past him, almost bowling him over. 
tHe slows as he nears the doors to his office and the Oval
tOffice, DISCOVERING:

tTOTAL CHAOS.  EXCOM guys, Assistants, dart to and from the
toffices and halls.  On all their faces grim expressions. 
tKenny stands there a beat in confusion.  And then Bobby
tswings out of Kenny's office.  There's a desperate edge to
tBobby's voice.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWhere've you been?  We've been trying to

tKenny and Bobby walk fast for the cabinet room, Kenny still
tin his coat.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWe're getting everyone together as fast
ttas we can.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWhat does the letter say?

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttThey want us to take our missiles out of
ttTurkey along with the no invasion

ttafter all, and they were just stalling
ttfor time.

tKenny is stunned.

<b>ttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt gets worse.

tKenny gives Bobby a sharp look as they enter --

<b>tINT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tThe President, in shirtsleeves, no tie, glances up at Kenny
tas he and Bobby enter.  Kenny can only bear his look for a
tsecond: he blew the call on Fomin.  But the President is
tclearly relieved to see him, gives him a faint smile. 
tHalf of EXCOM, including McNamara, McCone, Rusk, and Taylor
tbarely notice them as they're already there arguing.

tKenny sits down hurriedly, shucks off his coat as he joins
tthe conversation in mid-stream.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttMy specialists are in agreement: this
ttmorning's letter is not Khruschev.  Last
ttnight's letter was.

ttThe evidence supports only one
ttconclusion: there has been a coup, and
ttKhruschev was replaced overnight.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttJesus Christ...

tBobby gives him a look: told you things got worse.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttDean?

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttIt doesn't necessarily mean there's been
tta coup.  Khruschev's name is signed to
ttthe letter.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttAw, come on, Dean!

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttBut at the very least... It does suggest
tthe's been co-opted by hard line
ttelements.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttWhich at the end of the day is the same
ttthing as a coup.  A puppet Khruschev,
ttand a hard-line Soviet government
ttpulling the strings.  No deal.  And the
ttmissiles are almost operational.

tBitter silence.  They all look to the President.  Imminent
tvictory has turned to ashes.  The President studies his own
tfolded hands.  Ball and Thompson enter, take seats.  One by
tone, throughout the scene, other EXCOM members join the
tgroup.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttYou know, the problem we have is that
ttthis is latest offer of theirs will seem
ttreasonable to everyone.  We remove our
ttmissiles, they remove theirs. 
ttOur Jupiters were scheduled for removal
ttanyway.  They're obsolete, after all.

tKenny shakes his head in mute anger.  McNamara and Rusk seem
tto sense the President's feelings, too.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttMr. President, agreeing to such a trade
ttwould be tantamount to paying ransom. 
ttThey'll put a gun to our head again, and
ttexpect us to pay again.

tKenny looks the President in the eye.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWe can't sell out one of our friends for
ttour own safety.  NATO wouldn't trust us
ttanymore, and they'd be right not to.

tThe President sighs in the face of the stern advice.  He
tnods, expecting as much.  Bobby still can't look at anyone.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttSo which one of you geniuses can tell me
tthow to explain ourselves to the world? 
ttHow do we work with them if there's been
tta hard-line coup?

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttMr. President, there is another
ttpossibility we haven't considered.  This
ttmay not be a coup at all.

tEveryone of Kenny's instincts jumps.  His head snaps up to
tlisten to Taylor.  Taylor pauses.

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR (CONT'D)
</b>ttIt's possible that the back-channel
ttoverture, last night's letter, and this
ttletter today, along with everything the
ttSoviets have said all along, is nothing
ttmore than a lie -- disinformation.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttDesigned to keep us from taking action.

tKenny hears the fatalism in McNamara's voice.  A long beat. 
tEveryone stares at McNamara.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA (CONT'D)
</b>ttI hate to say it, but if I had to bet,
ttI'd bet Max is right.  What if they have
ttno intention of honoring this deal,

ttisn't working and they're continuing to
ttwork on the missile sites.

ttI think we have to consider issuing

tThey were so close last night... and suddenly Lundahl and
tLeMay enter the room with the day's briefing boards.

<b>ttttLUNDAHL
</b>ttMr. President...

tLundahl stands there at the end of the table, gray.  He
talmost can't say it, can't look the President in the face.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttThen we're out of time.  We have to go
ttin.

<b>ttttLUNDAHL
</b>ttThat may not be as easy as we thought
tteither.  We've gotten confirmation that
ttthe Soviets have also deployed
ttbattlefield nuclear weapons to Cuba. 

tA pall falls over the room as LeMay explains.

<b>ttttLEMAY
</b>ttFROGS, we call 'em.  Short range

ttOur capability to get all the missiles

ttthe moment we know where the FROGS are,
ttand we can target them, too.  But the
ttlonger we wait, the hard it's going to
ttget.

tThey all look to the President.  Kenny stares, in a private
thell, blacker and more complete than anyone should ever know.

tIn that shocked silence each man grapples with failure.  The
tBest and the Brightest could not prevent what must come next.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttThen we have no choice.
ttt(to  Taylor)
ttGeneral, issue the warning orders to our

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttUnderstood, sir.  We need to step up the

tThe President gives Kenny a meaningful look.

tTaylor exits.  Kenny rises, gives the President an almost

tA cart speeds down the tarmac, an NCO behind the wheel. 
tBeside him sits Major Anderson, his helmet on, visor up.  He

tUp ahead, among a host of service vehicles, sits the U-2.

tA silver glint appears in the center of the horizon.  It
tgrows larger.  Then larger still.  It is the U-2.  We barely
thave time to register the rising hiss of its engines, when it
tFILLS THE SCREEN and BOOMS PAST, leaving us standing still.

tThe CAMERA PANS to follow it, but it's already dwindled to a

tthen hits the CAMERA ACTIVATE button on his joystick. 
tBAMABMABMABMA... The camera begins its photography.

tAnderson watches the number on the film-remaining counter
tspool down.  He stares out the window.  The towering clouds
tbelow rise up magnificent, glorious... a glimpse of heaven.

tRapt,  Anderson stares.  And then suddenly a BLARING ALARM
tGOES OFF IN THE COCKPIT.  It shocks Anderson around to the
tcontrols.  It's his MISSILE WARNING LIGHT.

tAnderson' hands flash out to the joystick, turning off the
tcameras, disabling autopilot.  He banks the U-2 hard.

<b>tEXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

tAs the U-2 turns, far, far below, emerging from the clouds,

tThen ANOTHER.  The anti-aircraft missiles creating them are
ttoo small to be seen with the naked eye.

<b>tINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

tThe cockpit is a cacophony of alarms and lights, the horizon
toutside tilted.  Anderson's breath comes fast, rasping as he
tdoes his strains going into the high-g turn.

tHe looks out the cockpit window, finds the first SA-2 missile
tin pursuit only several thousand feet below him now.  He
twaits. Waits.  Waits, still in the turn.  The black head of
tthe missile now visible.

tHe puts the plane over, rolling out into an opposite bank.

<b>tEXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

tThe spy plane's long flimsy wings weren't made for

tbut can't and vanishes into the distance at a 90-degree
tangle.

<b>tINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

tAnderson's breath comes faster and faster as the second

tas it goes, trying to outrun death.  Every second is a tenth
tof a mile, and every mile shortens the missile's life span.

tThe rising missile drafts aft, closing on the U-2 from
tbehind.

tThe second missile's contrail rises up behind the plane,

tThe third missile rises up in the far distance behind the

tThe second missile races up on the U-2, closer, right behind
tit, can't miss.  Then at a hundred yards, the contrail
tsuddenly peters out, and the missile, out of fuel, drops
taway.

tBut the third missile closes.

<b>tINT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

tstands up from behind his desk, grave.  And Kenny knows.

<b>tINT. CABINET ROOM - DAY
</b>
tAll of EXCOM is there except for Bundy.  Kenny sits behind
tthe President, deeply distraught over Major Anderson.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttDoes this attack on our plane represent
tta definitive, intentional escalation on
ttthe part of the Soviets?

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttThe Soviets are in control of the SAMs. 
ttIt's hard to believe with their

ttcould be an accidental launch.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttMr. President, taken with the events of

ttconfirms our worst fears.  We're now
ttdealing with a hard-line Soviet

tIn the silence, Kenny reads the faces around the room. 
tThey're convinced by McCone's pronouncement.  Kenny's not.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttIt could be a mistake.

tMcCone gives him a get-serious look.  But Kenny presses on.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe need to be positive before we react.

tBundy enters the room.  Everyone looks up.  He stands there
tin the doorway, his face tight.

tKenny sags in his chair.  Bundy, of course, has more bad
tnews, and they all know it.  A hopeless beat.  The President
tjust stares at Bundy, unable to ask.  Bundy nods, affirming
twhat everyone is thinking.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttA U-2 on a routine air-sampling mission
ttover Siberia got lost and penetrated
ttSoviet airspace.  The Soviets scrambled

</b>ttMr. President, our pilots are in danger. 
ttWe must order punitive airstrikes
ttagainst the SAM site that shot down

tAnd finally the moment Kenny has dreaded all this time has
tcome to pass.  He looks at Bobby, then at the President.  The

ttrying to read the Fates' design in it.  A long beat, and
teveryone holds their breath.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT

tdrops behind him -- his step is faster, more urgent.

<b>tEXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
tKenny walks down the sidewalk, drawn toward the Ellipse.  The
tsixth grade FOOTBALL PLAYERS sweep forward with a running
tplay.  Kenny scans them, searching, his breath coming hard.

<b>tEXT. ELLIPSE - DAY
</b>
tHe reaches the edge of the open field.  And then he spots the
tname on the jersey: O'Donnell.  It's Kevin. The players
trelinquish the ball and the offense comes off the field. 
tKevin sees his dad.

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttHey!  Dad!

tKenny manages a smile as Kevin trots over.  Kevin pulls his
thelmet off.  They stand there a long beat, Kenny desperate to
ttake him up, abandon his post... but he doesn't.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttHey, sport.  You winning?

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttYeah.

tBut Kevin sees the turmoil in his father's face.

<b>ttttKEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>ttIs everything going to be okay, Dad?

tKenny's forced smile is answer enough.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttYeah, Kev.  Everything's gonna be fine.

tBut Kevin knows.  Together they know.  The end of the world
tis at hand.

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttI guess you won't be coming home
tttonight.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttI, uh...

tSuddenly a car HONKS.  Kenny turns around.  Bobby is leaning
tout the rear passenger window of his limo.  And he sees what
tKenny is doing.  He doesn't want to cut in, but has to.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttKenny!  We need to talk.

tKenny looks back at his son.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttGet back out there, kid.  Remember to
tthit 'em hard.

<b>ttttKEVIN
</b>ttWhat about you?  Where are you going?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttBack to work.

tKevin puts his helmet back on his head.  Kenny watches as
tKevin jogs off to rejoin his team.  Kenny turns his back on
this son, and strides for Bobby's limo, dying inside.

<b>tEXT. SANS SOUCI PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
tKenny and Bobby stand by their car off to one side of the
trestaurant's parking lot.  Bobby's Secret Service Agents
tmaintain a discreet distance.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttIf we're going to make a deal, we're
ttgoing to have to do it fast.  This is
ttonly getting out of control.  The only
ttreason we're not at war this very minute
ttis he's been able to stretch, bend and
ttbreak his own rules.  He won't be able
ttto keep it up forever.

tBobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth.  A beat. 
tKenny looks him in the eye.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttAnd?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttAnd Jack wants to trade the missiles in
ttTurkey.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttThe Jupiters are obsolete.  They were
ttsupposed to have been dismantled last
ttsummer anyway --

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>tt-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  I told you
tthow stupid it was to float the Lippman
ttarticle!  But you wouldn't listen to me. 
ttWhat if there hasn't been a coup at all? 
ttWhat if it's you two who invited that
ttsecond letter by raising the possibility
ttof a trade?

tBobby is speechless with rage.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>ttAnd if the two of you are thinking this
tttrade is your ace in the hole, you're so
ttwrong.  It's a deuce.

tBobby's beyond furious.  They catch their rising voices.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>ttAnd it's not just me who thinks that. 
ttEveryone on this so-called EXCOM is
tttelling you exactly the same thing: make
ttthe trade, and they're going to force us
ttinto trade after trade until finally
ttthey demand something we won't trade
ttlike Berlin, and we do end up in a war.
ttt(beat)
ttNot to mention, that long before that
tthappens, this government will be
ttpolitically dead.

tBobby simmers for a long beat, thinking.  And boy, does this
tguy hate admitting he's wrong.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttAll right, so maybe we overestimated how
ttreasonable this trade would look.  Okay? 
ttYou happy?  So now what?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttSo now you've got to talk him out of it. 
ttAnd then we've got to figure out an
ttacceptable political solution.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttAnd if there has been a coup and there
ttis no acceptable political solution?

tKenny stares off at the city, agonized.

<b>tINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tKenny enters from his office, finding Bobby, Rusk and
tSorensen talking with the President.  The President gives him
ta brief, meaningful look.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttWhatever response we send, it will take
ttseveral hours for the wire to be
ttreceived by our embassy and delivered to
ttthe Kremlin.  So we're looking at early
tttomorrow morning at the earliest before
ttKhruschev could respond.

tAs Rusk talks, Kenny passes close by Bobby.  Bobby whispers:

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttHe gets it, but he's pissed.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttThat's all well and good, but what do we
ttsay to 'em?

<b>ttttSORENSEN
</b>ttIt depends on if we really believe
ttthere's been a coup.

tThat strikes a cord with Kenny.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttI agree.  If there has been a coup, and
ttthere's a hard-line government in power
ttnow, then it doesn't matter what we say. 
ttThe end of the day we'll either agree to
tttheir terms, they'll agree to ours, or
ttwe'll go to war.  But what if there
tthasn't been a coup?  What if... what if
ttwhat is happening is a series of
ttaccidents?

<b>ttttSORENSEN
</b>ttThe second letter is an accident?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttNo.  The letter is an intentional, but
ttit's having an effect far greater than
ttits authors intended.
ttt(beat)
ttWhat if our Jupiter missiles are just a
ttlast minute haggle to salvage something? 
ttMaybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to
ttthe hard line, not really caring if we
ttreject it or not?
ttt(beat)
ttAnd then these accidents have happened.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttMaking the second letter and the overall
ttpicture look worse than it really is.

<b>ttttSORENSEN
</b>ttThe Guns of August.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttExactly.
ttt(beat)
ttIf they're sane and human like we are,
ttthen maybe we just refuse, and they'll
ttlet it slide, like we've been letting
ttthings slide.

<b>ttttSORENSEN
</b>ttSo we reject the second letter.

tAnd Kenny looks at Bobby.  The world stops.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttNo.  We don't reject it...

tIt hits Bobby like a lightning bolt.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>tt... We accept the first letter and
ttpretend the second doesn't exist.

tThe President, Rusk and Sorensen stare at him, mute.

<b>ttINT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tHOLD ON the exact same mute reaction from the entire
tassembled EXCOM.  Finally McCone breaks the spell.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttIt won't work --

tBobby, Kenny and Sorensen start to object, but McCone raises
this voice over theirs.

<b>ttttMCCONE (CONT'D)
</b>tt-- because it's wishful thinking!  It's
ttthe same wishful thinking that blinded
ttus all these months while the Soviets
ttwere sneaking those missiles in under
ttour noses!

tMcNamara shakes his head, intrigued but skeptical.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttIgnore the second letter, agree to the
ttconditions of the first...

<b>ttttGENERAL TAYLOR
</b>ttThere's no reason to believe the Soviets
ttwill let it go.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttMax is right.  Why will they accept it?

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttIt can work.  If, IF they believe we'll
tthit them.

tKenny, Bobby and Sorensen look at McNamara, grateful.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe've only got time for one more round
ttof diplomacy.  The first airstrikes
ttstart in less than 36 hours.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttBut we have to make them agree to it. 
ttSo how do we do that?

tThe President leans forward.  Sensing he's about to speak,
tall eyes turn to him.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttWe give them something.  We tell them
ttwe'll remove the missiles from Turkey
ttsay, six months from now so that there
ttappears to be no linkage.  We also tell
ttthem if they go public about it, we deny
ttit and the deal is off.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttAnd we do it under the table so we can
ttdisavow any knowledge of it.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttIt's transparent.  The press'll be all
ttover it.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttSix months from now, I'm not going to
ttcare.  Are you?  We'll deal with it.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttAt least it will expose whether
ttKhruschev has been overthrown.  We'll
ttknow what we're dealing with.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttAnd if this is a move to appease the
tthard line, then it may just be the bone
tthe needs to regain control of his own
tthouse.

tMost EXCOM is nodding, agreeing.  McCone shakes his head in
tdisgust.  Taylor sits in silence.

<b>ttttRUSK
</b>ttWhoever carries the message has to hit
ttthe nail on the head.  Come across as
tttoo soft, they'll push us.  Too hard,
ttthey'll be cornered and even more
ttdangerous.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttThey could pre-empt.

tIt's a terrible responsibility to bear.  The room is silent. 
tAt last Bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother. 
tThe President stares back.  There is nobody else who can do
tthis.  Only Bobby. His brother.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttBobby.  You know Dobrynin best.

tBobby nods, taking up the gauntlet.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttTed, you get working on the draft.

tSorensen and Bobby rise as one, head for the doors.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttAnd make sure he knows we have to have
ttan answer tomorrow.
ttt(beat, final)
ttBecause on Monday we begin military
ttaction against Cuba.

tBobby and Kenny exchange a look.

<b>tEXT. WEST WING DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tA LONG SHOT: Bobby emerges from the West Wing in his
tovercoat, briefcase in hand.  He pauses, tiny, alone.  The
tWest Wing - and all its imposing spotlit power behind him -
treduced to this insignificant man on his eleventh-hour
tmission.

tAnd then, out of the shadows, in the f.g., steps Kenny in his
town coat, his breath frosting in the late-night air.  Bobby
tsees him, and knows he is not so alone anymore.

<b>tON THE DRIVEWAY
</b>
tThey meet in front of the limo.  Bobby stops, shuffles his
tthings, awkward.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttWhat do you want?  A good-bye kiss?

tKenny opens the driver's side door.  The Secret Service LIMO
tDRIVER peers out.

<b>ttttLIMO DRIVER
</b>ttHey, Kenny.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttHey, Joe.  Listen, I'll take care of
tthim.  Go ahead in, grab some coffee. 
ttWe'll be back pretty quick.

<b>ttttLIMO DRIVER
</b>ttYou sure?

tKenny's nod and look -- there's no arguing.  The Limo Driver
thops out, and Kenny gets in.  Bobby stands there outside for
ta beat.  He tries to hide how touched he is, but can't
tcompletely.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttWhat's the matter with you?  Forget how
ttto open a car door?

<b>tINT. BOBBY'S LIMO - NIGHT
</b>
tBobby recovers, opens his own door, gets in the front seat
tnext to Kenny.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttJesus, you rich people.

tKenny starts up the engine.  Bobby smiles a twisted smile. 
tAs the car pulls away, the two men sit in silence, neither
twilling to admit how glad the other is there.

<b>tEXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVE. - NIGHT
</b>
tThe limo wheels out into the street, carrying the two friends
tinto the darkness.

<b>tINT. BOBBY'S LIMO - NIGHT
</b>
tBobby stares out the window at the passing city, the lights
tthe lives behind those windows.  As the car drives on and on,
tthe tension returns.  Bobby feels the weight of all those
tlives.  On him.  A long beat.  He gazes at Kenny, the only
tman he could ever admit this to:

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttI don't know if I can do this.

tKenny glances over at him.  Bobby stares back.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThere's nobody else I'd rather have
ttgoing in there.

tBobby looks at him.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>ttNobody else I'd trust Helen and the
ttkids' lives to.

tKenny means it.  He looks away.  Bobby shifts, awkward.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttTake a left.

tKenny looks him.  This isn't the way to the Justice
tDepartment.  But he complies.

<b>ttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe gave so much to get here.  I don't
ttknow.  Sometimes I think what the hell
ttdid we do it for?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttBecause we knew we could do a better job
ttthan everyone else.

tAnd Bobby, in the silence and closeness of the car, turns on
tKenny - anguished, knowing his life is at its climax.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttYou know... I hate being called the
ttbrilliant one.  The ruthless one.  They
ttguy who does the dirty work.  The one
tteverybody's afraid of.  

tKenny looks to him, moved, not knowing what to say.

<b>ttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttI hate it.  I'm not smart, you know. 
ttAnd I'm not so ruthless.

tHe looks to Kenny, searching his face, then away,
tembarrassed.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttYou're right about the smart part, but
ttruthless, well...

tThat breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene:

<b>tTHROUGH THE WINDOW
</b>
tAppears the grim, square lines of the SOVIET EMBASSY.  Police
tcars line the streets outside it.  All the windows are dark. 
tA cordon of KGB GUARDS in plainclothes stand by the gated
tentrance.  On the opposite side of the street lounge two
tdozen WASHINGTON D.C. POLICE.

<b>tRESUME
</b>
tKenny gives Bobby a look.  Bobby rolls down his window.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttSlow down.  Smell that?

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttSmoke.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttJust wanted to see for myself.
ttt(beat)
ttThey're burning their documents.

tThe final duty of an embassy before war...

<b>ttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttThey think we're going to war.  G-d help
ttus, Ken.

<b>tEXT. SOVIET EMBASSY - NIGHT
</b>
tTHE CAMERA lifts away from the limo, turning toward the
tEmbassy, past the Guards, past the brass plate which reads
tEMBASSY OF THE UNITED SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, up and up
tto the roof where black, reeking SMOKE billows from all of
tthe Embassy's several chimneys.

tThe CAMERA races into it.  It engulfs us all.

<b>tEXT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tKenny squeals the limo up to the curb in front of the Justice
tDepartment.  The doors fly open, and Kenny and Bobby jump
tout, head up the steps to the building.

<b>tINT. HALL OUTSIDE BOBBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tBobby's STAFFERS greet them as they stride down the hall,
tStaffer #1 taking Bobby's coat.

<b>ttttSTAFFER #1
</b>ttSir, Ambassador Dobrynin is already
tthere.  We have him waiting in your
ttoffice.

tThey reach the double oak doors to Bobby's suite and stop. 
tBobby faces Kenny.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttI'll whistle up some luck for you.

tAnd before Kenny's eyes, all of Bobby's doubt vanishes.  In
tits place, a severe confidence.  A grandeur Kenny has never
tseen.

tIt makes Kenny pause.  He beholds his best friend become a
tman of the ages.  And then Bobby SMOOTHLY opens the door.

<b>tINT. BOBBY'S WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
tAnd a DOOR SHUTS OC like a threshold of history.  HOLD ON
tBobby's waiting room.  Silent.  Cavernous.  Dim.  Plush
tcarpet.  Heavy drapes framing dark windows.  And abandoned
tsecretary's desk.  A row of sofas and chairs on either side
tof the room.  Two doorways, one at either end of the room.

tA WOMAN sits in one of the chairs for visitors.  Dressed in
tgray.  Prim.  But beautiful.  A secretary of some sort.

tOne of the double doors to the hall swings silently open. 
tKenny glides in.  He sees the other door shut at the far end
tof the room.  Kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait.

tHOLD ON THE SCENE, motionless, silent.

tKenny WHISTLES two notes.  Stops.  And then he begins to
tWHISTLE the Irish tune, O'Donnell Aboo.  He gets a bar into
tit -- and there's a polite, soft COUGH.

tKenny stops.  Then notices the Woman in gray across the room. 
tHe didn't see her.  It's dim over there.  She looks at him,
texpressionless.

tThe CAMERA FINDS: a pin on her lapel.  A RED HAMMER AND
<b>tSICKLE.
</b>
tKenny reacts.  Dobrynin's assistant?  His opposite number?  A
tfriend?  Or more than a friend?

tHere is the face of the enemy.  Not a smile between them. 
tKenny resumes his ease.  And begins to WHISTLE again.

tThe haunting Irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling,
tfilling the dim room.  Strange, sad, beautiful.  The woman
tlistens.  And her face begins to soften.  

tKenny stares at the dark, lonely windows, his SONG striving
tto fill the empty room.

tKenny sinks deeper in the chair, his tune all-consuming...
tand the Woman's voice breaks in.  Kenny stops, looks over. 
tHer voice is tremulous and beautiful.  Just a snatch of some
tsong in Russian.  She stops, awkward.

tKenny stares.  The Woman stares back.  No smiles.  But in
ttheir eyes, they each see the other's fear, the other's
tbeauty, the other's humanity.

tSo this is the enemy.

<b>ttttTHE WOMAN
</b>ttWho are you?

tKenny glances to the door.  He considers for a long moment.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThe friend.

tKenny breaks the gaze.  He begins to whistle again.  The
tCAMERA drifts away, finding the far DOOR to the inner office,
tKenny's tune stronger, carrying with it hope...

<b>tINT. BOBBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
t... to the other side of that DOOR.  Dobrynin sits in a chair
topposite Bobby behind his desk.  The room is equally dim. 
tAnd far more tense.

tSilence.  And then the FAINTEST STRAIN of O'Donnell Aboo. 
tDobrynin glances briefly over his shoulder at the door.

tBut Bobby, unseen by Dobrynin, can't help the flicker of a
tprivate smile.  It's Kenny's presence, and Bobby is the
tstronger for it.  And then the tune is gone.

tBobby leans forward, cool, controlled, masterful.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttAmbassador Dobrynin, we are aware that
ttat this moment your missiles in Cuba are
ttat the brink of operational readiness...

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tEXT. MISSILE SITE - CUBA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tFloodlights illuminate MISSILES, vertical on their erectors,
tsupport VEHICLES, clustered across the man-made clearing.

tMask-wearing Technicians wave a FUEL TRUCK back to the
tnearest missile.  Clouds of toxic VAPOR rise from the others. 
tThey've already been fueled.

<b>ttttBOBBY (V.O.)
</b>ttThey are a vital threat to my country. 
ttIf launched, they would kill 80 million
ttAmericans.

<b>tttttttSMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. BOBBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tDobrynin listens impassively, as is his professional duty.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttMy brother, my friends, my countrymen
ttand I cannot and will not permit those
ttmissiles to become operational.
ttt(beat)
ttI promise you that.

tDobrynin looks out the window.  And then, pained, looks back
tat Bobby.

<b>ttttDOBRYNIN
</b>ttThen I fear our two nations will go to
ttwar.  And I fear where war will lead us.

tBobby acknowledges him with a nod.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttIf the missiles do not become
ttoperational, if you remove the missiles,
ttthen there will be no war.
ttt(beat)
ttAt this moment, the President is
ttaccepting the terms of Secretary
ttKhruschev's letter of Friday night.  If
ttthe Soviet Union halts construction
ttimmediately, removes the missiles, and
ttsubmits to U.N. inspection, the United
ttStates will pledge to never invade Cuba
ttor aid others in that enterprise.

tDobrynin stares at Bobby.  Stares hard.

<b>ttttDOBRYNIN
</b>ttIf your Jupiter missiles in Turkey were
ttremoved also, such an accommodation
ttcould be reached.

tThe two men move their argument forward with the deliberation
tand formality of chess masters.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttt(tired sounding)
ttThe United States cannot agree to such
ttterms under threat.  Any belief to the
ttcontrary --
ttt(beat)
tt-- was in error.

tDobrynin reels internally.  The only sign on his face is a
tslight tremor.  Bobby looks up, registers the calculated
teffect.  And to Dobrynin's horror, the Russian believes:

<b>ttttDOBRYNIN
</b>ttYou want war...

tBut not so fast.  Bobby folds his hands.  And he smoothly
tgoes from hard-ass brinksman to sensitive deal-maker.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttHowever, while there can be no quid pro
ttquo on this issue, the United States can
ttoffer a private assurance.

tDobrynin holds his breath.

<b>ttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttOur Jupiter missiles in Turkey are
ttobsolete, and have been scheduled for
ttwithdrawal for some time.  This
ttwithdrawal should be completed within,
ttsay, six months.

tDobrynin lets out his breath.

<b>ttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttOf course, any public disclosure of this
ttassurance would negate the deal and
ttproduce the most stringent denials from
ttour government.

tDobrynin grasps the move immediately, understanding the
tramifications.  Still he hesitates a moment.

<b>ttttDOBRYNIN
</b>ttThis private assurance represents the
ttword of the Highest Authority?

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttYes.

<b>ttttDOBRYNIN
</b>ttAnd it can be relayed beyond Comrade
ttKhruschev's ears to the top circles of
ttmy government

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttOf course.  Our pledge can be relayed to
ttany government official Secretary
ttKhruschev sees fit to satisfy.

tMeaning this is the bone he can show the hard line.  Dobrynin
tstruggles internally, knowing what Bobby has done, wanting to
thug him.  It comes across as agitation.

<b>ttttBOBBY (CONT'D)
</b>ttWith the caveat that it is not made
ttpublic in any way, shape or form.

ttAnd we must have an answer tomorrow at

ttenough.

<b>ttttDOBRYNIN
</b>ttTomorrow...

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttTomorrow...

tDobrynin rises from his chair.  Bobby rises with him.

<b>ttttDOBRYNIN
</b>ttThen you must excuse me and permit me to
ttrelay the substance of our discussion to
ttmy superiors.

tDobrynin heads for the door.  Half way there he turns back to
tBobby, deeply moved.  Deeply grateful.

<b>ttttDOBRYNIN (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe have heard stories that some among

<b>tINT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
tKenny enters the Oval Office through his side door.  The
toffice is dark, only the desk lamp on.  Kenny's gaze moves
tover the trappings of power: the carpet with the Presidential
tSeal, the rocking chair by the fireplace, the desk.

tAnd on the desk, tucked almost out of sight, sits a small,
thumble wooden plaque.  It's turned to face the occupant of
tthe chair behind the desk.  Kenny reaches out, turns it
taround.  It is the Breton's Fisherman's Prayer.

tIt reads: OH LORD, THY SEA IS GREAT, MY BOAT SO SMALL.

<b>ttttBOBBY (O.S.)
</b>ttWe're out here.

tKenny holds on the plaque a beat, and looks up at the open
tFrench door to the Rose Garden.  The curtains swirl around

tThe President gestures out across the South Lawn to the
tgleaming Washington Monument.

ttdidn't have a leg to stand on.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttAll he had was his character.

tThe President and Bobby nod at the justice of that remark.

<b>ttttBOBBY
</b>ttHow does a guy get a rep like that?

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttDoesn't matter to me.  If I went down in
tthistory like Adams, I'd die happy.  All
ttthey say about him today is --

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>tt-- he kept the peace.

tKenny looks at the President.  The President feels it, and
tgazes back to him.

tThe three of them stare out at the glittering city.  The
tgrandness of the world lies before them, and they are
tdeciding its fate, and are humbled by the awfulness of it. 
tThe silence is beyond power.

tAnd for a long moment, they know not to disturb it.  There is
tnothing left to say.  The President, at last, finishes his
tdrink.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttYou know, we never did control it.  Not
ttreally.  Not like we think.

tHe looks at Kenny.  Kenny nods.  He knows that now too.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttBut we did our best.  Now it's up to
ttthem.

<b>tEXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
tKenny's limo pulls away, leaving Kenny, coat in hand, at the
tbottom of his driveway.  He watches it go, silently urging it
tto return for him with some call from the President telling
thim he's desperately needed.  But it doesn't.

tHe turns to his house.  The lights are all out.

tHe notices he's CLUTCHING the handle of his briefcase.  His
tknuckles are white.  With conscious effort, he unfolds his
thand, letting the briefcase drop on the driveway.

tHe stands alone, stripped of his friends, his family, his
tjob... and in that moment, mute, impotent in the shadow of
tArmageddon, Kenny is our Everyman of the Nuclear Age.

<b>tINT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tHelen stands in the kitchen, a ghostly white figure in her
trobe, the windows open and curtain flapping as she breathes
tthe air.  Kenny enters.  He stands in the doorway.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttI saw you out there.  You want him to
ttcall you back, need you.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttNo.  I'm glad I'm home.

tAnd she knows the worst.

<b>ttttHELEN
</b>ttHow long do we have?

tKenny's voice breaks. 

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttIf the sun rises in the morning, it is
ttonly because of men of goodwill.
ttt(beat)
ttAnd that's all there is between us and
ttthe Devil.

tThey take each other in their arms, the wisdom of the atomic
tage so simple, so tenuous, every human life hanging by such a
tthread... yet a thread so powerful.  The CAMERA RISES FROM
tTHEM, finding the OPEN WINDOW and the DARKNESS.

<b>tINT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAWN
</b>
tThe RED DOME OF NUCLEAR FIRE rising over Washington.  It
troils the air in its expanding, blood-red glory.

tIt is the sun.  The dawn in the East.

<b>tPULL BACK THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW.
</b>
<b>tSUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 28TH.  DAY 13
</b>
tinto Kenny and Helen's bedroom.  And silence.  Kenny and
tHelen lie together on the bed.  The light burns into Kenny's
thalf-shut eye.  Kenny is only dimly conscious of the light's
tmeaning.  Until the PHONE SHRILLS downstairs.

tKenny is instantly up, launched out of the room.

<b>tINT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tKenny snatches the RED PHONE from its hook.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttBOBBY (O.S.)
</b>ttKenny.  It's over.

<b>tEXT. ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH - DAY
</b>
tTHE CHURCH BELLS TOLL in raucous celebration.  Kenny, Helen
tand the five O'DONNELL KIDS join the throng packing through
tthe doors to the church.  They're all smiling except Kenny
twho searches fro faces in the CROWD.

tAnd then he spots Bobby with his FAMILY.  Bobby grins at him. 
tThat makes Kenny grin back.

<b>ttttRADIO MOSCOW (O.S.)
</b>ttThis is Radio Moscow.  Moscow calling.

tBut Kenny keeps looking.

<b>ttttRADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>ttThe following statement is the text of a
ttletter from General Secretary Khruschev
ttto President Kennedy.

tKenny spots him emerging from the Presidential limo,
tsurrounded by Secret Service Agents - John Kennedy.  His
tFAMILY also is with him. 

<b>ttttRADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>tt...I regard with respect and trust the
ttstatement you made in your message of 27
ttOctober 1962 that there would be no
ttattack, no invasion of Cuba, and not
ttonly the part of the United States, but
ttalso on the part of the Western
ttHemisphere, as you said in your same
ttmessage.  Then the motives which induced
ttus to render assistance of such a kind
ttto Cuba disappear...

tKennedy, greeting well-wishers, a brilliant smile on his
tface, is carried through the crowd toward Kenny and the doors
tof the church.

<b>ttttRADIO MOSCOW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>tt...it is for this reason that we have
ttinstructed our officers - these
ttmissiles, as I already informed you are
ttin the hands of Soviet officers to take
ttappropriate measures to discontinue
ttconstruction, dismantle them, and return
ttthem to the Soviet Union.

<b>tEXT. MISSILE SITE - CUBA - DAY
</b>
tthe base has been half-dismantled over night.  Fuel trucks
tpull away, lumping down the makeshift dirt road.  Across the
tsite missiles are lowered, their nose cones being removed.

tA MISSILE on its transporter, Technicians crawling all over
tit, COVERING IT with a tarp.

tA massive Soviet Helicopter's rotors thunder as it lifts off,
tcargo crates swaying under it, a CLOUD OF DUST FROM ITS WASH
<b>tFILLING THE SCREEN, WIPING US TO:
</b>
<b>tINT. CABINET ROOM - DAY
</b>
tEXCOM laughing, celebrating, half-drunk already this Sunday
tmorning.  The President shushes the group.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttHey!  Hey.  Okay, that's enough.

tThe group quiets down.  The Presidents stares at them, calm,
tfirm.  They sober up quickly.  Kenny listens, expectant.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>ttI don't want any gloating.  This is not
tta victory over the Soviets.  It's a
ttvictory with the Soviets.
ttt(beat)
ttI want everyone to remember that.

<b>tINT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
tKenny rounds a corner.  McNamara, Bundy and McCone are
ttalking, excited, hushed, standing to one side, down the
thall.  Kenny eyes them as he draws closer, and then they
tnotice he's approaching.  Bundy nods him over, confidential.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttWe've been talking.  We can play this
ttbig in '64.  It's the foreign policy
tttrophy we've been waiting.

tKenny sickens.  He tries to listen, but it all begins to
tblur.

<b>ttttBUNDY (CONT'D)
</b>ttI think we can ride it all the way home
ttnext election.  Bet you're way ahead of
ttus, eh?

tBundy slaps Kenny on the back.  Kenny is pale.  Is what
tthey're saying possible?  But Bundy and McCone are too
twrapped up in their schemes to notice Kenny's distress.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttWe've ordered crash reassessment of our
ttmajor geopolitical hotspots.  We've got
tta lot of new clout, and we can run the
tttable on the Soviets.  Middle East,
ttSoutheast Asia...

tAnd Kenny, sad, moved beyond all pity and loathing, realizes
tit is possible.  They haven't gotten it.  He is speechless,
thelplessly shaking his head.  Bundy finally sees something
tisn't right with him.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttWhat's wrong, O'Donnell?

tKenny can't speak.  Can't find the words.  But tongue-tied
tfinally manages:

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttDon't you understand?

tMcNamara and Bundy look at him funny.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttUnderstand what?

tKenny just looks at them, eyes filled with sorrow.  They
tbegin to feel uncomfortable.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttThe sun came up today.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttIt shouldn't have.  But it did.

<b>ttttMCCONE
</b>ttWe were lucky we were able to keep it
ttunder control.

tKenny looks away, unable to bear it.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttEvery day the sun comes up... says
ttsomething about us.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttSays what, Kenny?

tKenny looks back at them.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttSomething... amazing.

tThey just stare at him.  And with secret smiles, superior
tsmiles, they nod.

<b>ttttMCNAMARA
</b>ttSure, Ken.  I understand.  Feels good to
ttwin, doesn't it?

tBut they don't understand, and together turn away.

<b>ttttBUNDY
</b>ttSee you later, Kenny.

tKenny watches them, heads bowed in discussion, disappear into
tthe labyrinth of the West Wing.  Kenny turns his back on
tthem.

<b>ttINT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
tThe President stands at his mirror, tying a bow tie to a tux
tfor some Sunday special event.  Kenny gathers up his folder
tfrom nearby breakfast table.

tKenny meets the President's gaze in the mirror, and the two
tmen know they have been to the same mountaintop.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT
</b>ttKenny...

tA beat.  Kenny stands straight, ready for action, ready for
tsome necessary thing.  Ready to go back into the game.

<b>ttttTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>tt...never mind.  See you around, Kenny.

tKenny starts to leave, but at the door, turns back.

<b>ttttKENNY
</b>ttYou know...

tThe President looks at him in the mirror.

<b>ttttKENNY (CONT'D)
</b>tt...this was what we're here for.

tThe President smiles an ever-so-faint smile.  Kenny turns and
tleaves the room, vanishing, and as we HOLD on the empty
tdoorway, the simple, whistled melody of O'DONNELL ABOO drifts
tfrom the hallway beyond, becoming our END MUSIC.

<b>tFADE OUT
</b>
<b>tSUPER:
</b>
tShortly after the crisis President Kennedy ordered a
treassessment of U.S.-Soviet relations, ushering a brief thaw
tin the Cold War.  During this time, the Washington-Moscow
thotline was installed to ensure that in a future crisis,
tmiscommunication would not lead to nuclear war.

tThe President was assassinated on November 22nd, a year after
tthe crisis ended.

<b>tTHE SUPER:
</b>
tBobby Kennedy ran for president in 1968.  After winning the
tCalifornia primary, he called Kenny from the Ambassador Hotel
tin Los Angeles and told him, "I finally feel like I'm out
tfrom under my brother's shadow."

tBobby was assassinated minutes later.

<b>tTHEN SUPER:
</b>
tThe members of EXCOM continued  to serve with distinction in
tgovernment in various capacities over the next three decades.
tAs Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara
turged containment of the Soviet threat in every theatre of
tconflict around the world.  He ultimately advised President
tJohnson to increase the U.S. military commitment to one of
tthese minor backwater conflicts: Vietnam.

<b>tAND FINALLY SUPER:
</b>
tKenny O'Donnell witnessed the President's assassination from
tthe car behind.  He went on to head the Peace Platform at the
t1968 Democratic National  Convention, fighting to end the
tVietnam War.  He died in 1977.
