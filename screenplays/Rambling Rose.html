<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
On a taxi arriving at the Delta terminal of Kennedy Airport.
A man in a well-tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi.

CUT TO a CLOSER SHOT of the man as he pays the cabbie. He is
WILLCOX HILLYER, the middle-aged "Buddy" of this story and
the observer through whose eyes it is seen. He has a dry,
ironic, rather agreeable manner and he should seem like
everyone's idea of a successful author, a slightly graying,
trim, still-youthful-looking fifty. The CAMERA follows him as
he walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag.

<b>INT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer at a counter getting his
ticket processed. A little smile is on his face as he talks
to a pretty airline girl. This character likes girls; his
aloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to
them. The airline girl smiles back, she finds him attractive.
We don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track --
it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, but
now a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if
slightly annoyed by something.

CUT TO a POV shot of a tall, gaunt, almost totally bald man
at the next ticket counter. The man is about sixty-five and
looks like a half senile Great Dane. He is DAVE WILKIE,
erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. Age has not
been at all kind to Dave; his face is lined with bitterness,
he is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a very
unpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline
representative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily.
He wears an expensive, ill-fitting suit and a Texas-type hat.
We don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the
track.

CUT BACK to a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he stares with
a frown at the man. It's as if he knows the man but can't
place him. The airline ticket girl speaks to him and he turns
back to her, his face softening as he answers her, obviously
saying he'll carry his bag. He nods goodbye to the girl,
turns and the CAMERA follows him as he walks some distance
away and stops, looks back with another pensive frown at the
tall, gaunt man at the next counter.

CUT TO ANOTHER POV shot of Dave Wilkie, a longer shot than
the first. The man is now arguing angrily with two airline
representatives, still waving his ticket and shaking his
head. We don't hear him. Lip-readers might pick up what he is
saying: "I'm supposed to be in first class, not tourist.
What's the matter with this friggin' airline?"

CUT BACK TO Willcox Hillyer, a CLOSE SHOT of his face as he
rubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember the
man. The CAMERA holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry
Dave, racking his brain. He shakes his head, he cannot place
the man and yet he knows him. The CAMERA moves in closer on
Willcox Hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at
this ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a
distance, FAINT MUSIC on the track -- it is "Dixie," played
with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great Louis Armstrong
in his prime. At first we can barely hear it, then the MUSIC
becomes LOUDER as Hillyer's frown deepens and he seems almost
to know the man.

<b>MAIN TITLE (SUPERIMPOSED): "RAMBLING ROSE"
</b>
The MUSIC remains a bit in the distance, but it can be heard.

OTHER TITLES (SUPERIMPOSED): over the following action.

VARIOUS SHOTS, on Willcox Hillyer. He gives up his effort to
recognize the strangely familiar Dave with a little shrug,
turns and walks away with his travel bag.

<b>INT. DELTA TERMINAL - LOUNGE - DAY
</b>
We see him entering the departure lounge and boarding the
plane.

<b>INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY
</b>
A shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive
young stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane. He
is not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face
when he sees a pretty girl -- he seems to have a real
affection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry
and ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. We see him sit
in a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley
sheets. He stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys,
then sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make
corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle.

Something or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight
frown and CUT TO a POV shot of Dave Wilkie, all wonder and
enthusiasm. This OVER the TITLES and we do not hear the
dialogue they speak, what we heard is LOUIS ARMSTRONG, but I
will put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. We do
not want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will
be obvious from the acting.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(not on track)
tBuddd-dee! My God, if it ain't
tBuddy! Well, if this ain't the
tdarnest thing!

ANOTHER ANGLE, on them both as Dave blocks the aisle, an
idiot false-toothed grin on his face. Hillyer has a pained
embarrassed smile.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(not on track)
tExcuse me... your voice is familiar
tand I'm sure I know you from
tsomewhere...

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(not on track, with
tt delighted injury)
tAwww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know
tme!

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(not on track)
tWell, I... I... ah-h, let's see...

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(not on track)
tIt's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie,
tdon't you remember me?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(not on track)
tOh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how
tare you?

The men shake hands, Dave enthusiastically, Hillyer less so.
We see Dave stow his suitcase and take the seat next to
Hillyer.

<b>EXT. KENNEDY - DAY
</b>
CUT TO a shot of a big Delta jet making its final taxiing
turn and ROARING into a take-off.

<b>INT. KENNEDY - DAY
</b>
CUT TO a dramatic underbelly shot of the jet going up.

<b>END OF TITLES.
</b>
<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY
</b>
A shot of the attractive, young stewardess, harried as she
fixes drinks.

<b>INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY
</b>
CUT TO Dave and Willcox Hillyer as the young stewardess gives
them drinks. Dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees
the single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an
aggressively self-satisfied conversation and says nothing to
her. He speaks to Hillyer, who is making a real effort to be
polite but is less than happy about the encounter.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tWell, I am in the construction
tbusiness, Buddy, and without
tbraggin' I have done real good at
tit. 
tt(with a meaningful
tt bitterness)
tThere are those who wouldn't have
texpected that out of me. 
tt(pauses as if waiting for
tt a reaction, but Hillyer
tt is very silent)
tRight now I'm buildin' a giant
tmotel unit near Alexandria, outside
tWashington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm
ton the construction side.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(making polite talk)
tWell, that's interesting, Dave. I
talways liked Washington, it's a
tpretty town.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tOh, it's all right, beats Jew York.
tBut the niggers have took it over,
tjust like every other city we got,
tonly worse.

Hillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but
Dave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self
satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
</b>tBut I have done real good in the
tconstruction field. What I don't
tknow about buildin' ain't worth
tknowin'. I knocked off twenty-eight
tthousand smackeroos last year,
thow's that for an old country boy?

Dave pauses, realizes this might not impress; glances down
with curiosity at the galley sheets, then an unpleasant
smile.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
</b>tHa ha, course you make a lot more. 
tt(points at the galleys)
tWhat's that you got there, Buddy?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(reluctantly)
tGalley proof.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tGalley what?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tPage proof of a book I'm working
ton.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tHow about that. Well, you always
twere a screwball.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(lifts an eyebrow in mild
tt irony)
tOh, yeah?

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(unfazed)
tI don't mean that the way it
tsounds. 
tt(stares at galleys as if
tt rattlesnake)
tImagine it, a book. And I used to
tknow you personal way back when.
tt(pauses, then earnestly)
tTell me something, Buddy, how do
tyou dream up all that stuff?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(absolutely straight)
tWell, actually, we have a little
tblack boy named Her---t who lives
tin the garage. He does it for me.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(for a moment half
tt believes it, then a slow,
tt stupid grin)
tHeh heh heh heh, same old Buddy,
talways jokin' around. Almost as
tmuch of a joker as your Daddy. 
tt(drains his drink,
tt grimaces; a heavy
tt drinker, Dave)
tI saw your Daddy a coupla years
tago, I was up in Glenville lookin'
tat a motel site. I guess that's
twhere you're headed, huh, to see
thim?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(stares out of plane
tt window)
tThat's right, Dave, I'm headed for
tGlenville on a whisperin' jet.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(suddenly calls out)
tHey, girl! Hey, you, give us
tanother drink! 
tt(to Hillyer, sullenly)
tDumb little bitch, supposed to give
tus two in the first place.

Willcox Hillyer listens with a pained half smile, a hand at
his temple.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
</b>tThis friggin' airline's out of its
tmind. 
tt(a martyr)
tThe sons of bitches tried to put me
tin tourist.
tt(portentuously
tt philosophical)
tBut our whole civilization is
tscrewed up, Buddy. The heebies and
tthe coconuts have took it over and
truined it.

Willcox Hillyer half closes his eyes in weariness, but says
nothing. Gently, he rubs his temple. It is plain Dave Wilkie
gives him a headache.

<b>INT. DELTA AIRPLANE
</b>
ANOTHER ANGLE, on the pretty young stewardess as she brings
two more drinks. Dave stares sourly at her, wholly unmoved by
her charm.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tTook your time gettin' here.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tShe has other things to do, Dave.

Willcox smiles apologetically at girl.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tSupposed to get two drinks in the
tfirst place. This friggin' airline
tcan't do nothin' right.

The stewardess purses her lips at Dave, who is bowed over his
drink busy opening it. Hillyer lifts an eyebrow at the girl
as if to say, "Don't blame me because of this damned idiot,"
and she half smiles at him.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(obviously getting him off
tt subject)
tTell me about that job in
tAlexandria, Dave, the big motel
tyou're building.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(with pedantic exactitude,
tt the man is a complete
tt pain in the ass)
tNear Alexandria. It isn't in
tAlexandria, it is outside it.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER
</b>tI see. Outside it.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE
</b>tThat's correct -- outside it, not
tin it. As for the job, well, the
tJewboy suppliers give me a lot of
tgrief and we use a pile of niggers
tto haul and tote and they ain't
tworth a sorry-ass damn. 
tt(takes big swallow of
tt drink)
tBut I can build anything, Buddy.
tGive me the plans and I can build a
tgoddamn staircase to the moon. It's
ta fact, I can build anything... 
tt(pauses, then bitterly)
t... but she never believed that.
tOh, hell, no, she never believed in
tme.

This is another pointed bitter reference to the unknown
"she." Once again, Willcox Hillyer is deliberately
unresponsive.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER
</b>tUm-m, well...

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(broodingly)
tDoubted my ability all along, the
tlittle bitch. I never remarried,
tBuddy, you know that, don't you?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tWell, no, I didn't actually.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tShe's te reason -- cured me of
twomen once and for all. Oh, I got
trid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste
tno time kickin' that bitch out.
tHell, she was screwin' everybody in
tSavannah. I caught her in a motel
twith this long tall son of a bitch
tand boy did I beat the everlastin'
tpiss out of him!

Dave Wilkie's eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it
and one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the
man. It is frightening even now; he is a clown, but he is a
dangerous clown. As his long, bitter, impassioned tirade
continues, Willcox Hillyer becomes increasingly tense and
pale -- it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and
he is struggling to control himself.

Dave's tone and voice are laconically Southern, but the
hatred and misery in his eyes are raw.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
</b>tShe didn't marry him, though, later
tshe married another guy and went to
tWinston-Salem. It didn't last
tThat girl couldn't have no lastin'
tmarriage, she left him and married
tanother dumb sucker and went out
twest. Little bitch left him, too,
tand you know what she's married to
tright now?
tt(puts a big finger on
tt Hillyer's chest)
tA kike. That's right, some kind of
tkike horse doctor named Schapiro
tout in Seattle, who's got the nerve
tto have the same first name I got.
tWouldn't you know it, Rose would
twind up married to a goddamn kike?
tShe was always out of her friggin'
thead and I'll tell you why.
tt(his eyes narrow and again
tt he puts a finger on
tt Hillyer's chest)
tBuddy, she was sick in her mind and
tbetween her legs, too. She was
ta nymphomaniac.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER
</b>tt(he has had enough; with a
tt pale trembling anger and
tt in even tone)
tDave, you are as full of shit as a
tChristmas turkey and you know it.
tNow if you want to start a fight on
tthis plane and get yourself in
tjail, go right ahead. But I am
ttelling you, you are full of shit
tright up to your eyeballs.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(with surprising mildness;
tt a little smile almost as
tt if he is pleased)
tI don't want to start no fight with
tyou, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full
tof shit?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tDave Schapiro is no horse doctor
tand Rose has been a good wife to
thim for a long time. To call her a
tnymphomaniac is the most stupid
tthing I ever heard in my life.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(again surprisingly mild)
tYou loved her, didn't you. Well, so
tdid I. 
tt(a little shrug)
tYou'll have to admit she had four
thusbands.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tYeah, it took her a while to grow
tup and find Mr. Right, but she did
tit. She found him.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(another little smile)
tShe used to call me Mr. Right.
tRemember that, Buddy?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(he is pale with anger)
tYeah, I remember it.

Willcox picks up galley sheets, half turns away.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tWell, I tell you, I don't know what
tthe world's come to these days.
tThings used to be better. We didn't
thave any money, but things were
tbetter. 
tt(grimaces in anger)
tGoddamn niggers and kikes burning
tthe flag, rioting, raising hell --
tthey ought to shoot their asses
toff. I tell you, Buddy, where this
tcountry made its mistake was
tallowing people without property to
tvote.

During this speech, Willcox Hillyer grits his teeth but says
nothing. He keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. As Dave
shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation ..

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. ATLANTA TERMINAL - HERTZ COUNTER - DAY
</b>
A shot of Willcox Hillyer at a Hertz Counter in the Atlanta
airport. A tense, wrought up Dave Wilkie is in the b.g. of
the shot. During the following brief exchange, Hillyer is
politely cool, Wilkie under a great strain.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(holds out hand)
tWell, got to get a plane to
tSavannah. Great running into you,
tBuddy. Give my best to your Daddy.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tYeah, I'll do that, Dave.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(sweating, tense, under
tt some kind of awful
tt emotional strain)
tAh-h, if you happen to run into
tRose sometime... do me a favor,
tgive her a message for me, will
tyou?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(a trifle wearily)
tDave, I haven't seen Rose for
tyears.

Hillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young HERTZ
GIRL, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag.
In desperation, Dave takes his arm.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tBuddy, I'm a sick man. I had a
theart attack last year, I wasn't
texpected to live.

Hillyer turns to Dave, puzzled and interested; Dave earnestly
explains.

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
</b>tYou might see her. She writes your
tDaddy, and she and that doctor came
tto see him, didn't they? I wish
tyou'd tell her something... I never
tcould write letters.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(in a different tone,
tt interested, curious)
tWhat do you want me to tell her,
tDave?

<b>tttDAVE WILKIE 
</b>tt(a painful inward
tt struggle; the man is
tt tormented, miserable)
tOh, to hell with it, never mind.
tDon't tell her anything. Don't even
ttell her you saw me. 
tt(half turns his back, his
tt face twisted with strong
tt emotion)
tGot to run, Buddy, I'll miss my
tplane.

Willcox Hillyer and the pretty young Hertz Girl stare after
Dave Wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. Hillyer
seems affected, less hostile toward Dave now. He speaks half
to himself, half to the Hertz Girl.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tHe still loves her. The poor damn
tfool still loves her.

<b>tttHERTZ GIRL 
</b>tWho was she?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tA girl named Rose.
tt(pulls himself back into
tt the world of reality)
tStill take R75 to Glenville?

<b>tttHERTZ GIRL 
</b>tYes, sir.

Willcox nods thanks and walks away carrying his travel bag.

<b>EXT. ATLANTA AIRPORT - ROAD - DAY

A shot of the red Ford on Interstate 75, Atlanta skyline in

<b>EXT. GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY
</b>
On the red Ford as it speeds along a Georgia Interstate
through red clay hills in green springtime.

<b>INT./EXT. CAR - GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY
</b>
CUT TO a shot on Willcox Hillyer CLOSE ON his face in the
car. He is lost in reflection. A look of bitter sweet emotion
is on his face, an expression of sadness mixed with
amusement. As the CAMERA holds on his face, we hear again on
the track Louis Armstrong's great version of "DIXIE," or
music of comparable power, beauty and nostalgic evocation.
Now the music is stronger, much stronger than behind the
titles, we are beginning to hear it full force.

</b>
<b>BLURRED SCREEN FLASHBACK:
</b>
<b>EXT. HILLYER HOME - DAY
</b>
A shot of a thirteen-year-old boy on the front porch of a
house in the sleepy Depression South of many years ago. He is
BUDDY, Willcox Hillyer as a boy. The MUSIC continues as he
shades his eyes to look at something far away.

<b>EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY
</b>
CUT TO a LONG POV shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl
walking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. A ZOOMAR LENSE
takes us TOWARD her. She is carrying a cardboard suitcase
tied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are
dusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired and
seems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but her
primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and
sweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with
the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she
stares ahead uncertainly at the "nice" Southern home which to
her seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frightened
and apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhausted
from the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. She
blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces
herself to walk on.

<b>EXT. HILLYER HOME - PORCH
</b>
CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the porch. Expressionless,
unreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an
even gaze directly into the CAMERA. He has his hands on his
hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a
mannerism of his father's.
Buddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always
with complete success. Unreadable as a Sphinx, he stands
there, waiting.

<b>EXT. HILLYER HOME PORCH - DAY
</b>
CUT TO a POV shot of Rose at the foot of the porch steps. A
tentative little smile is on her face. It is very plain she
is nervous and frightened.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tHello. I'm Rose, and I've come to
tlive with you and your family.

Silence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen,
Rose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another
little smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the
steps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot.
He still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his
expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.

<b>tttROSE (CONT'D)
</b>tWhat's your name? What do they call
tyou?

Finally, the boy speaks -- and he is not so bad. He's a child
after all.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tLots of things. Buddy, mostly.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tt(greatly reassured, a real
tt smile now)
tBuddy. Well, now, that's a nice
tname, I like it. I am real pleased
tto meet you. 
tt(solemnly holds out her
tt hand, they shake)
tHey, look, do you think you got a
tcold drink of ice water somewhere?

<b>tttBUDDY
</b>tSure. Let me take your suitcase.

A warm and beautiful smile comes on Rose's face and a little
twinkle comes into her eyes. The innocence and sweetness are
not lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes
boys and men.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tYou're sweet.

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME BEDROOM STUDY - DAY
</b>
CUT TO a shot of Buddy's mother, Mrs. Hillyer, in a Morris
chair in her bedroom study.

MOTHER is a sensitive, kind and rather appealing if slightly
eccentric lady of about 37 or 38. She wears glasses, has a
Victorian hairdo and a 1930ish style dress. At the moment
Mother is absorbed in her studies -- notebooks and history
books are littered and piled everywhere around her chair. She
is drinking a Coca-Cola and smoking a cigarette held by a
bobbie pin. Calmly, she glances up as Buddy enters the room.
The CAMERA pulls back to include him.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tThe new girl is here.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tWonderful. What's she like,
tBrother? What is your impression of
ther?

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tShe talks a great deal and smiles a
tlot. She's very pretty, she has a
treal good figure. She's very
tgirlish or womanish, if you know
twhat I mean. She wouldn't hurt
tanybody, this girl. She couldn't.

Mother accepts her son's precocious pronouncement as
perfectly normal; talks to him as if he's an adult.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tYour impression is very reassuring,
tBrother. Of course she's had
ttroubles, poor thing, but I sensed
tthat was that the girl was like and
tI'm glad to have it reconfirmed.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tYou mean confirmed, Mother. I
tdidn't confirm it before. I would
thave had to confirm it previously,
tin order for it to be reconfirmed.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tAll right, all right. Doll and
tWaski are upstairs taking their
tnap, you go get them and bring them
tdown to the living room. Where is
tthe girl?

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tIn the kitchen drinking all the ice
twater in Glenville. She walked out
there, she didn't go by the hotel.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tWalked, in all that heat? It's a
twonder she hasn't got sunstroke.
tI'll phone Daddy and you go get
tDoll Baby and Waski.

<b>tttttttDISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM
</b>
A shot of Mother, Rose, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the living
room of the Hillyer household. DOLL is a pretty little girl
of about 11, WASKI a boy of 5. Mother's tone is very gentle,
very sweet, very kind. Her unabashed admiration for her own
children has an ingenuousness that is more amusing than
offensive.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tRose, this is Waski. His real name
tis Warren but we call him Waski. He
tdoesn't like it much and I suppose
tsomeday we'll have to stop calling
thim that.

<b>tttWASKI
</b>tYou can stop it right now.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tWhen he was baby we called him "Wa
tWa," a baby name, you know. You
twill find him a very good boy. His
tbrother can be bad and so can his
tsister, but Waski is a very good
tboy. And as you can see he's
tbeautiful.

<b>tttWASKI 
</b>tOh, Mother, cut it out.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(serenely)
tThere are plenty of girls who would
tgive thousands of dollars to have
tyour auburn hair. Beauty is beauty
tand that's all there is to it.
tBeauty is there and we have to
trecognize it. Now Rose, the little
tgirl sitting across from you with
tthe blue eyes is Doll Baby. She
tlooks like an angel and she is an
tangel, but she can be a naughty
tangel sometimes, although her
tfather won't believe it. Her real
tname is Frances, but we call her
tDolly or Doll.

<b>tttDOLL 
</b>tI don't like that, either, it's
tworse than Waski. I want to be
tcalled Fran.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tDaddy wouldn't hear that. Now the
tredhaired boy you see sitting
tthere, of course you have met him,
the is my oldest son and my most
tbrilliant child. All children have
tgreat creative powers, but I don't
twant to rattle on about my
tchildren, they say I brag too much
tabout them, especially about
tBrother. Am I boring you, Rose?

Rose has not as yet caught on to Mother's style and is
staring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly popped.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tt(feebly)
tOh, no, ma'am.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tWell, it's rather interesting about
tBrother, actually. I realized the
tremarkable thing he had when he was
tsix weeks old. He looked at me and
tunderstood me, he knew exactly who
tI was. I know it sounds crazy but
tit's true. He's very remarkable, he
twas born for the ministry and could
tmove millions, but he doesn't know
tthat yet. I have to warn you about
thim, he can be very dangerous,
tthere is an evil streak in him, a
tstreak of pure sheer meanness. But
tat heart Brother is saintly and
tthat is why he was born for the
tministry even if he doesn't know
tit.

Thus, Mother. Slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with
reality, but no fool. A very intelligent woman really, and
very, very gentle and kind.
Her style, however, takes a little getting used to and her
long speech throws Rose completely. She stares at Mother in
speechless open-mouthed awe, unable to say a word.

The CAMERA moves in CLOSER on Rose as she moistens her lips,
swallows, tries to talk and can't. She is very, very nervous.
Now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine
VOICE OVER the shot. It is the voice of DADDY, Mr. Hillyer,
Buddy's father.

<b>tttDADDY'S VOICE 
</b>tHoney, you'll scare the gizzard out
tof the girl going into the fourth
tdimension like that.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy in the doorway of the living room. He
is a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner
all his own. As extravagant as his remarks often are and
funny though he is at times, the man has a courtly Southern
dignity that is never lost. He is no clown, he is not even a
comedian, he is a man and a formidable man at that: all the
characters in this story love and fear him. We see now where
Buddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on
the hips thing. Daddy is unreadable. A straw hat is on the
back of his head, a rolled-up Glenville Tribune is in his
hand, his hands are on his hips. He is staring with what
seems to be stern fierceness at them all, but his attitude
really is inscrutable.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tIt isn't the fourth dimension. To
tyou it's the fourth dimension,
tmaybe, to me it's simply the truth.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tt(staring fiercely at Rose)
tWell, well, well. So Miss Rosebud
thas arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all
tassembled here. Yes, indeed. Un
thmmm.

Daddy walks in as Rose stares wide-eyed at him. It is obvious
he scares the absolute bejesus out of her, she looks actually
as if she might faint, her hands trembling on her lap and her
knees quivering beneath her cheap and tacky dress. But she
has a surprise coming. She is soon to lose all her fear of
him, every bit of it. Daddy walks over and sits in a chair
beside her, stares fiercely at her for a moment, then begins
a long speech. Again, extravagant as this speech is, he is no
clown, he is not "being funny," he means every word he says.

<b>tttDADDY (CONT'D)
</b>tWell, Rosebud, now you are here,
tdarling, and I swear to God
tgraceful as the capital letter S.
tYou will adorn our house, Rosebud,
tyou will give a glow and a shine to
tthese old walls. If there's one
tthing I like to have around, it's a
tfrizzy-haired blonde. Now I assume
tMrs. Hillyer and the children have
tintroduced themselves and made your
tacquaintance, and so forth and so
ton?

Rose can barely answer, eyes fixed in rapt fascination on
him, a half whisper.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tYes, sir.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tAll right. Now as head of this
thousehold I have a couple of
tremarks to make. It is my dear
twife's belief, which I accept
talthough I do not totally grasp it,
tthat to hire a person to do
thousehold work is a criminal
tpractice. Therefore, you are here
tnot as a servant, you are here as a
tfriend, as a guest and hopefully as
ta member of this family. You will
teat your meals with us, you will
tshare life itself with us -- in
tlove and harmony, dear Rosebud, in
tlove and harmony. Do you understand
tme?

<b>tttROSE
</b>tt(a half whisper)
tYes, sir.

Daddy pauses, then in a different tone, his hidden gentleness
and kindness are much more plain; as he talks Rose's eyes
begin to well with tears.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tNow, I know you've had some
ttroubles in your life, those...
tscoundrels in Birmingham and so
tforth trying to... lead you astray.
tI hope you find a safe haven here,
thoney, I know you've had a hard
ttime. Life can be cruel to a young
tgirl all alone. We welcome you to
tour home, Rosebud, we all welcome
tyou from the heart and hope you are
thappy here.

Rose bites her lip, her eyes are filled with tears; an
inaudible whisper.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tYes, sir.

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME
</b>
VARIOUS SHOTS of Rose doing household chores: sweeping the
floor, vacuuming, cooking. She is cheerful in her work,
smiling, good-humored and she works hard. It is obvious she
is happy. We see the children in most of these shots. It is
apparent Rose is a very good worker and very happy in her new
home.

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Rose is washing the dishes while the children finish
breakfast. Buddy looks up from this cornflakes with a
slightly sly expression.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tRose, who were those scoundrels in
tBirmingham?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tNobody.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tBut who were they?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tThey were just bad men, that's all.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tIn what sense were they bad?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tBad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no
tsense to it.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tDid they try to induce you to
tbecome a prostitute?

Rose turns around, lifts her eyebrows, tosses down the
dishcloth.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tI don't answer talk like that,
tBuddy. I just don't hear it, I turn
tmy back and look away.

Rose turns her back on him.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tWas that what they tried to do? Was
tthat why Daddy gave you the job, to
tsave you from those scoundrels?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tYour Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll
tsay that. He's the best and most
tkind-hearted man in the world.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tHey, Rose, did you hear about that
tterrible thing down in Cave
tSprings?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tWhat terrible thing in Cave
tSprings?

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tThere was this old man that ate his
tniece.

Rose stares emptily for a moment, then bites her lips
together.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tI didn't hear you. I didn't hear
tthat.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tHe really did, he ate his little
tniece. He made pork chops out of
ther.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tI don't hear you. I just turn my
tback on that kind of talk and look
taway.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tWell, it's only the truth. There
tare horrible things in the world,
tRose.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tBuddy, you are in one of your evil
tmoods, I don't want to talk to you.
tI'm going out and sweep the patio.

Rose exits and the CAMERA stays on Buddy, Doll and Waski.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tRose is almost as sentimental as
tMother. If there's one thing I
tcan't stand it's sentimentality. In
tChattanooga this man committed an
talmost perfect murder. He killed
this wife with a black widow spider.

</b>tOh, shut up, Buddy.

</b>tYeah, shut up.

CUT TO a shot of Rose on the stone patio of the Hillyer
house, an attractive area with outdoor furniture and
crabapple tree limbs overhead. Rose is busy sweeping. The
CAMERA PANS to follow her and we pick up Mrs. Hillyer,
Mother. It is a nice day and she is studying out on the
patio, books and notebooks piled around. Rose glances down
curiously at her.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tWhat are you studying now, Mrs.
tHillyer?

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tMore history, Rose.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tAre you going to get your degree

<b>tttROSE

tIt's the least I can do after all

</b>tt(gently)
tWell, you run on now.

Exit Rose. Mother adjusts her notebook and turns the page of
a history book as she resumes her studies. We hear the sound
of an approaching CAR and she glances up.

rolls up the driveway of the Hillyer home, Daddy at the
wheel.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Daddy as he gets out of the Model-A. He has
his usual straw hat on the back of his head. The CAMERA
FOLLOWS him as he walks onto the patio.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tGood morning, sweetheart. Beautiful

</b>tYes, it's so nice I thought I'd
twork outside.

</b>tSlow, hon. But at least I can
tconcentrate now that Rose is here.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tWhat do you think of her, honey?

Mother doesn't answer, she writes on, head bowed over her
notebook. We see in this shot the hearing aid she wears and
hear from it a faint BUZZ.

<b>tttDADDY (CONT'D)
</b>tTurn up your hearing aid.

CUT TO a shot of Buddy in the window of the kitchen. He is
propped on his elbows and listening with keen interest to the
talk on the patio. We hear the VOICES of his parents OVER the
shot.

<b>tttMOTHER'S VOICE 
</b>tIf you mean... boys and men, I
tdon't think so. Rose seems very
tcalm about all of that.

We see Doll and Waski playing a game on the kitchen table.

</b>tHope for the best? I don't

</b>tHotcha character. If I had to live

humming as she works. We hear on the track the SOUND of the
Model-A starting, and Rose freezes. Then, quickly, Rose
hurries down the hall toward the front door.

ON Buddy as he watches her through a crack in the door. He
has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his face is
expressionless.

ANOTHER ANGLE, POV of Buddy but CLOSER on Rose at the end of
the hall. She is staring soulfully through the glass of the
front door as we hear the Model-A go down the driveway. Rose
lifts a hand between her breasts, sighs. A lovesick
expression is on her face.

Buddy, Doll and Waski are all seated in neat, nice clothes,
hands washed and hair combed. Rose is serving, but a place is
set for her. She wears an attractive little apron and is
smiling, blushing, happy as Daddy teases and jokes at her.

Doll. Buddy slews his eyes toward his sister, who meets his
gaze for a moment then looks down at her plate. The CAMERA
MOVES on to Mother, who is utterly oblivious of anything
going on between Rose and Daddy.

seated at the table now. She is picking lifelessly at her
food and glancing from time to time with a lovesick
expression at Daddy, who is busy eating and seems wholly
unaware of it. Mother also is wholly unaware, but all the
children know what is happening. Rose takes a gravy for a
biscuit and spills a little, her hand is trembling.

</b>tt(half to himself)
tEhh, Lord, should have bought that

</b>tOh, oh! Oh, Mr. Hillyer, I love

For a long time Daddy stares groggily at her with a half
frown as if he can't believe it. In order to stare at her, he
must tilt his head back and, handsome man though he is, he
looks a bit like a startled rooster. Her breasts are pressed
against him, and her eager -pink lips are waiting for a kiss.

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy and Rose, as he struggles to rise
from the chair. They are half falling to the floor and now
they fall, Rose still on his lap. One of her breasts has come
out of her dress, which is very loose and low-cut. She has no
bra, the breast is bare. Daddy is staring groggily at the
breast as if slightly dazed.

DOWN LOW, we can see under the dining room table now. Daddy

away.

<b>tttDADDY
</b>tAll right, that is enough of this

<b>tttBUDDY

by the dining room table, half-crying as she adjusts her

at her.

</b>tGoddamn you, girl! You've made me

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tYou shouldn't watch such things,

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Daddy. Now Rose is sitting penitent
and crying in one of Daddy's handkerchiefs. Daddy's anger is
gone, he has gotten control of himself and speaks to her now
in a different tone.

He sits beside her, an arm around her shoulders in a fatherly
way.

</b>tRose, Rose, Rose, you poor

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - TOP OF STAIRS - NIGHT
</b>
ON Buddy and Doll at the top of the stairs. They pause to
talk and now they don't have to whisper. Doll is happy,
pleased.

<b>tttDOLL 
</b>tWasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted
tto kiss her some more and play with
ther, but he didn't, because he
tloves Mother and all of us, and he
tloves Rose, too. Isn't he

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tt(dryly, aloof; he doesn't

tWonderful? He kissed her and played
twith her titty, and I don't see
tanything so great about that. He
twas probably afraid Mother would
tcome back early and catch him.

<b>tttDOLL 
</b>tYou know, Buddy, sometimes you make
tme sick.

Doll gives him a venomous glance and walks away. The CAMERA
STAYS on Buddy as he stares after her with a thin little
smile. Be seems wryly amused that he has made her angry.
After a moment, he turns and stares in the direction of
downstairs and his face changes. His smile fades, then slowly
returns as he thinks of what has happened.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tt(quietly, to himself)
tThermopylae. The Persians shall not

It is obvious that secretly Buddy admires very much his
father's behavior.

</b>
<b>INT. HILLYER HOME BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A shot of Buddy at night in his small bedroom.

He wears a rather skimpy old-fashioned nightshirt that comes
midway between his hips and knees. At the moment he is
finishing brushing his teeth at the bureau, using an old
fashioned water pitcher and bowl. The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he
walks across the room in the light of the lamp by his bed. He
looks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of his
bed. He pushes it far back and we see springs. He takes out a
small "book" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it.

CLOSE-UP: The front cover of the pamphlet. We see the overall
title: LITTLE DIRTY COMIC BOOKS. And beneath it: BLONDIE AND
DAGWOOD. And beneath that, in smaller letters: "Mr. Dithers
Comes to Dinner -- and How!" We see Buddy's hands in the
shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a
glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a drawing
maybe of "Blondie" stark naked with a finger in her mouth
going, "Tee-Hee!"

ON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the
Little Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps to
the bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to the
bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on the
flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a
faint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back the
covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and
throws the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies on
pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of his
room OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on a weepy Rose in a very thin nightgown. The
shot is FROM BELOW as Buddy might see her as she stands over
his bed. She looks very lonely and unhappy and is half
crying.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tBuddy... are you asleep?

ANOTHER ANGLE, on both of them. Buddy stares at her in
surprise. It is dim in the room, but we can see them in the
moonlight.

<b>tttBUDDY
</b>tNo, I'm awake. What's the matter?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tBuddy, I am wandering in a
twilderness, lost. 
tt(sits glumly on edge of
tt bed)
tI just feel awful. Do you mind if I
tget in bed with you for a little
twhile?

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tWell, all right.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed in the moonlight.
It is all innocent enough, Buddy is a child and Rose
obviously has no lewd intent in getting into his bed. She
lies back on a pillow staring up at the ceiling and smoking a
cigarette.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tI thought I'd go crazy back there
tin that room all by myself with
tnobody to talk to. As a child, I
tnever had no room all to myself, we
twere awful poor. Buddy... I have
tgot a confession to make.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tWhat is it, Rose?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tIt's so terrible I can't tell you.
tOh, Buddy, you don't know how it
thurts to have a broken heart, what
ta terrible feeling it is, and I've
thad a broken heart so many times.
tMen, I don't understand them, I
tcan't figure them out and they
tbreak my heart, that's all. I can't
tfind Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find
thim no matter how hard I look, all
tI find is a whole pile of Mr.
tWrongs. But this is the worst ever
tbecause it wasn't his fault. It was
tmy fault, oh yes, my fault, I was
tbad -- oh God, I was bad, you
twouldn't believe how bad I was.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tt(a little smile)
tWhat'd you do, Rose?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tBuddy, I was horrible. I can't tell
tyou who it was, but do you know
twhat I did? I sat on his lap and
tgot ahold of him and wiggled and
twiggled my ass on him and was
tworse'n you could know, a child
tlike you. Why, I let one of my tits
tfall out deliberate on purpose and
tpractically smack him in the face
twith it and I let my dern skirt
tcome up so he could see my
tdrawers... 
tt(pauses, realizes this
tt isn't too dignified)
tBut to get back serious to what I
twas sayin', it is not only, Buddy,
tthe loss of him but my own bad
tbehavior what bothers me so...

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tYou were pretty bad, huh?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tWhy, it has just made me ill,
tBuddy. I'm sick. I don't want to
teat nothin', I don't, and me I got
ta good appetite, that ain't nat'ral
tfor me. I'm ill.

<b>tttBUDDY
</b>tt(slyly, pretends he
tt doesn't know)
tBut, Rose, what is the cause of it
tall?

<b>tttROSE
</b>tPromise not to tell Doll? -- or
tnobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm
tso much in love with him I am out
tof my mind!

<b>tttBUDDY
</b>tBut, Rose, how could such a thing
tas that happen?

<b>tttROSE
</b>tI fell madly in love with him when
the called me Rosebud. You know that
tfirst day when I come and he said I
tlooked graceful like a capital
tletter S and called me Rosebud? I
tfell madly in love with that man
tright then.
tt(sighs tragically)
tBut it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a
tgood man and won't have nothin' to
tdo with me.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed. Buddy has
propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the
moonlight -- we see the soft notch between her breasts in the
open V of her thin nightgown. She is completely unself
conscious with him.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tt(casually)
tCan I touch you here?

Before she can answer, he touches her breast with his finger
through her nightgown.

<b>tttBUDDY (CONT'D)
</b>tHmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tt(casually, doesn't object)
tWhat did you expect?

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tWell, I thought they were more like
ta cantaloupe.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tHa ha ha, that's some idea, a
tcantaloupe.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tt(touches her breast more
tt boldly, his hand outside
tt the nightgown)
tThere's some kind of gristle in it,
tthough.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tBuddy, quit that, you're just a

tinterested in such things.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tActually, I am, though.

tt cigarette and stares up
tt at the ceiling)
tYou know, that Daddy of yours is

tto come out of his mouth next.

<b>tttBUDDY
</b>tCan I put my hand inside your

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tNo, you can't. And I'll tell you
tthis -- he scares me. As kind as he
tis, he scares me. You can't fool
taround with him, not with that man.
tAnd, boy, I sure better not try
tnothin' like that with him again,
the'll fire me.

</b>tRose, can't I see what the nipple

<b>tttROSE
</b>tt(frowns)
tBuddy, what's come over you? A

<b>tttBUDDY
</b>tBut I'm curious, Rose.

Puts his hand in her nightgown.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tBuddy, get your hand offa me! Quit

Takes his wrist.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tJust for a second. Please, Rose,

</b>tt(gently)
tBuddy, you don't realize it but

</b>tAw, come on, Rose, I want to see

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. We
see Daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly
out into space. Mother lies asleep in a big four poster in
the background of the shot. Daddy sighs wearily to himself in
the grip of "insomnia in reverse."

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
CUT BACK to Buddy and Rose in bed. He has evidently sweet
talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in
her nightgown. There is no indication of lewd interest on
Rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face.
Buddy seems quite fascinated, however.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tWell, are you satisfied now? Can we
tjust lie and talk, huh?

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tHmmph. It has a nipple, all right.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>t'Course it does.

<b>tttBUDDY

tYou know, Buddy, sometimes I can't

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A shot close on Rose and Buddy in bed. Evidently Rose has
weakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her, but we can
only surmise this, the shot is on their heads and shoulders
and a cloud has crossed the moon, the light is more dim. A
different look is on her face, a solemn expression as if she
is listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely
haunting. She moistens her lips, speaks in a slightly feeble
voice.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tYou better quit that.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tBut Rose...

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tI must be outta my mind. Buddy,
tquit it.

tOh, God, I must be outta my mind.

The hand falls limply from Rose's eyes and she turns her head
to the side and closes her eyes. Helplessly, she lies there
as the boy fiddles with her.

tI must be crazy, a child like you.
tOh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful,
tthis is terrible, I gotta get outta

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy as Rose in a panic gets out
of the bed, pulls down her thin nightgown and tiptoes toward
the door. She stops and looks back as a chilling thought
occurs to her.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tBuddy, you wouldn't tell nobody,

<b>INT. HILLYER SOME - UPSTAIRS HALL AND DOWNSTAIRS HALL
</b>
CUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in
his bathrobe. The shot is down the staircase and Rose in the
upstairs hall tiptoes into the picture. A floorboard creaks
and he looks up and sees her.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tRose, what are you doing up?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tNothin', just goin' to the

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tIs anything wrong?

</b>tNo, sir.

</b>tWell, good night.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose in the upstairs hall. Fortunately for
her the light is dim. Her knees are shaking beneath the
nightgown, she looks as if she might faint.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tGood night.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS her as she goes on shaky legs down the
hall.

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
CUT TO a shot of Rose as she enters her small bedroom.
Feebly, as if totally exhausted, she shuts the door behind
her then leans against a bureau and states into its mirror.
The horror of her own criminality has overwhelmed her. With
trembling hands, she takes a cigarette from her half empty
pack and finds a wooden kitchen match on the bureau.
Her hands tremble visibly as she strikes the match. She has
not turned on the light in her room and her considerable
charms are very apparent in the orange glow of the match.
Burning match in her fingers, she stares at her own
reflection in the bureau mirror, transfixed by a horrible
realization.

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - DREAM - CELLAR
</b>
QUICK DISSOLVE TO BLURRED SCREEN: the border of the screen is
blurred, we are obviously seeing a nightmare fantasy. The
shot is of an eager, excited, diabolically mischievous Buddy
and an astonished, awed DOLL. They are in some far dark
recess of the cellar of the house and the scene is furtive,
murky, cobwebby.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tWait till you hear what happened!
tNow you wont believe this, Doll,
tbut Rose came in my room and got in
tmy bed last night...

ANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy from below with candlelight giving his
child's face a sinister look. Now he has "Dracula" teeth and
evil arched eyebrows.

<b>tttBUDDY (CONT'D)
</b>t... and she sweated and snorted
tlike a horse and had a horrible

The match is still burning in her fingers.

A shot of Mother in her study, a worried Doll stands before
her. The border of the screen is blurred, it is another flash
of fantasy.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tYes, dear, what is it?

<b>tttDOLL 
</b>tMother, Buddy says Rose got in his

</b>
A shot of Daddy and Rose on the front porch of the house. The
scene is murky, dark, gloomy night and the weather is bad.
Daddy has his arm rigidly thrust outward as he points down
the driveway. A weeping, slumped Rose sadly walks down the
steps carrying her cardboard suitcase. Fantasy.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tOut! Out, you viper in the grass!
tOut! Never darken our doorstep, you
timmoral, terrible girl!

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

<b>tttROSE
</b>tOhh-hh, ohhh-hh... 
tt(match burns her fingers,
tt she shakes it out)
tOuch! Oh-hh... ohh...

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose as she turns from the bureau and stares
off into space, a very badly frightened girl. Half-crying,
she speaks to herself.

<b>tttROSE (CONT'D)
</b>tHe'll tell 'em for sure, he will.
tOh, Lord, what can I do?

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
CUT TO a shot of Buddy half asleep in bed. The light of the
lamp by his bed goes on and he sleepily opens his eyes. The
CAMERA COMES BACK and we see Rose in her nightgown standing
by his bedside. She is very pale and tears are on her cheeks.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tI hate to turn on this light, you
tDaddy's awake downstairs, but I
thave to take the chance.

tBuddy, I have to ask you, as bad as

tyour head and that's the truth. I
tlove you. But they'd think I did,
tthey'd think I was awful, they'd
tdespise me and hate me...

Rose bows her head and begins crying into her hands.

CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Buddy. We hear the soft sound of Rose
weeping over the shot. Buddy is affected, his flinty child's
heart has been touched, but he is not quite ready to admit it
yet. He is struggling with himself, trying to remain "cool"
and not show his emotion. He frowns, moistens his lips,
swallows. With seeming coolness, very much as in the scene
with Doll in which he deprecated Daddy's stand at
Thermopylae, he shrugs.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tWell, I don't know what you're
tworried about. It was my idea, I
twas the one who thought of it, not
tyou.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Rose. She is staring at the
boy with hopeless despair.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tYou don't understand. They'd blame
tme, not you. And they'd think I was
tawful, a disgustin' girl, which I

tt tears run down)
tBuddy, I know I'm no good, I'm a
tbad girl but I can't help it,
tplease have pity on me and don't
ttell! Please don't, please...

Too much for Buddy, he loses his "cool." He swallows and
blinks as if he might cry, then sits erect in the bed and
squares his shoulders and assumes a stern expression Daddy
style.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tt(very solemnly)
tRose, they could stick splinters
tunder my fingernails, and I will
tnever say a word! I will never tell
tthem, because... I love you!

tt himself)
tEhh-hh, Lord... great life if you

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
A shot of a coolly angry Mother in the kitchen. It is late
morning. As she talks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show a
sheepish Buddy standing "on the carpet before her. The other
children, Doll and Waski, are seated at the kitchen table
having hamburgers for lunch. They are happily smiling with
schadenfreude amusement at their brother's discomfiture.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tBrother, when I have to wake you up
tat eleven o'clock in the morning
tyou're either sick or you were up
tvery late last night. 
tt(points a finger at him)
tAnd you weren't reading Huckleberry
tFinn. I looked and its not in your
troom. Now what were you doing?

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tt(sheepish)
tMother, I have to tell the truth. I
twasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I
twas reading one of those Little
tDirty Comic Books.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(sadly)
tOh, Brother, I am so disappointed
tin you. You mustn't look at those
thorrible things, they degrade the
thuman image.

<b>tttBROTHER 
</b>tt(hangs head)
tThey're filthy, Mother.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tSex isn't ugly, sex is one of the
tmost beautiful things in life, the
tcreative power of the universe is
tbehind it.

<b>tttBROTHER 
</b>tI know, Mother.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tBut we must respect that power, we
tmust be in awe of it.

<b>tttBROTHER 
</b>tI am in awe of it, Mother.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tI don't think you are sufficiently
tin awe of it. Get the castor oil.

<b>tttBROTHER 
</b>tt(winces, as Doll and Waski
tt happily smile)
tOh, Mother, not the castor oil.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tThis isn't punishment, I don't
tbelieve in punishment. It's for
tyour health. Obviously you're sick
tif you can act like that.

As she talks, Buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil
and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. A smiling
Doll comes forward and hands Buddy half of an orange. He
makes a face at her. Mother takes the bottle and pours out a
tablespoon of castor oil.

<b>tttBUDDY
</b>tt(wanly)
tMother, cant you make it calomel
tinstead of castor oil?

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tThis is for your own good. When you
tlook at negative, destructive
tthings like those little filthy
tcomic books, you are sick. Here,
ttake this.

<b>tttBUDDY
</b>tt(he is resigned, there's
tt no way out; he makes a

tt oil)
tGeccch, yehh, guhhhh!

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tStop gagging like that and putting

</b>tUhhh, gahdam stuff!

</b>tWhat did you say, Brother? 

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tI said ahhh-dam stuff. 

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tNo, you didn't say that, Brother.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tYes, I did, mother. Your hearing

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tChildren, children! Be quiet, all

tt(the children at once

tThe vibrations in this house are

<b>tttBUDDY
</b>tShe's getting herself up to go out.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(frowns, adjusts hearing

tWhat'd you say, Brother?

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tShe's getting herself up to go out.
tI think she's coming down the hall
tnow.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tOh, yes, it's Thursday. 
tt(glances around at sound
tt of an opening door)
tHello, Rose, dear... 
tt(her eyes open wide as she
tt stares at Rose,
tt disconcerted; now weakly)
t... my, you're... looking pretty...

CUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She is
quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink
rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in
some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most
remarkable thing of all.

The skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin
material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could
be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the
least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white
sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white
material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her
breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material.
It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear
of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing
suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black
patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent
leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is
on her face.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tHow do you like my outfit? I made
tmost of it myself.

Rose walks in, "modeling" the outfit and the CAMERA PICKS UP
Mother.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(smiling, slightly aghast)
tWell, it's... very gay.

We hear the SOUND of the Model A on the driveway.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tHere comes Daddy.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tt(staring down admiringly
tt at the outfit)
tI have a knack for designing
tclothes. But I had to buy the shoes
tand the pocketbook.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(makes up her mind to
tt defend Rose)
tWell, I think it's charming, Rose. 
tt(tactfully)
tBut don't you think... ah, the
tskirt is a little tight?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tOh, no, that's the style. It's
tmeant to be clinging.

We hear the PORCH DOOR SLAM. Smiling, happy, Rose glances
around. We hear the SOUND of the kitchen door opening.

CUT TO a POV SHOT of Daddy in the kitchen doorway. As usual,
he has a rolled-up Glenville Tribune in his hand and a Straw
hat on the back of his head.His hands are on his hips and he
is hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tYe gods and little fishes. What
thave you done to yourself, Rose?

ON THEM ALL. Rose is smiling, happy to be the center of
attention.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tNothin'. I got myself up, that's
tall.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tGot yourself up?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tYeah. I'm goin' out.

Daddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head. Sits at
table.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tUm-hmm. Well, that is the damndest
toutfit I ever saw in my life. You
twalk down the street like that and
tthey'll put you in jail, Rose.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tWhy, they won't either. She looks
tpretty. And I wish you wouldn't
tpick on the poor girl all the time.
tDon't listen to him, Rose, you look
tpretty, even beautiful.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tt(smiles affectionately at
tt Mother)
tYou're so sweet.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tIf you've got time before you go
t"out," get me a half-a-cup of
tcoffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a
thalf-a-cup.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tWhy, sure, always got time to get
tyou a half-a-cup, and one of these
tdays I'm gonna get you a whole cup
tand see what happens.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tt(a growl, doesn't like
tt jokes about his foibles)
tUm-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole

tDaddy, Buddy was up late last night
treading little dirty comic books.
tMother gave him a dose of castor
toil and he cursed it, he took the
tLords name in vain, then claimed he
thadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tYou mustn't be a tattletale, dear.
tYou mustn't be Delilah-ish and
tJezebel-ish toward your brother,
tdear.

<b>tttDOLL 
</b>tI'm only trying to help him,
tMother.

<b>tttBUDDY 
</b>tHeh, what a hypocrite.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(to Daddy)
tI do wish you'd speak to Brother.
tIt's true he's been looking at
tthose horrible little books again.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tt(stares sternly at Buddy)
tLay off of that stuff, son. It
tupsets your mother.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(genuinely worried)
tI'm serious. We forget he's just a
tchild. I wish you'd speak to him.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tI'll take him with me downtown. 
tt(glances at Rose as she
tt comes with coffee)
tAnd you, too, Rose, if you want a
tride.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tSure, love one. Here's your half-a
tcup of coffee.

Daddy is staring with a very dubious frown at Rose's skirt.
He slowly shakes his head.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tThat's a pretty stylish skirt,
tRose. The only thing I don't
tunderstand is how did you ever get
tit on.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tt(happy, pleased by his
tt interest)
tWell, it has buttons.

Points to little buttons on right side of the skirt.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tHow can the buttons stand the
tpressure?

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tThere are more on the other side.

Points to buttons on left side.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tTurn around, darlin'.

Happy to oblige, Rose turns around. Her plump, round,
feminine behind is only too plainly revealed through the thin
material. Daddy slowly shakes his head.

<b>tttDADDY (CONT'D)
</b>tThey'll put her in jail. The damn
tlittle fool might as well be naked.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(a wee mite worried)
tWell, it is a little tight. But it
tisn't as bad as all that. No one
twill notice unless they have such
tthoughts in the first place.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tWho doesn't have such thoughts? 
tt(glances at wristwatch)
tWe'd better get going.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tYou're not having lunch?

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tJust half-a-cup of coffee. I never
teat, darlin', you know that. Not
teating and reverse insomnia are my

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tShe was raised on a poor dirt farm.

tor hardly even a doctor.

<b>tttDR. WINTON 
</b>tWell, she has one mouth in ten

tis an impacted wisdom tooth, but
tthere isn't a cavity in her head,
tnot a single one. She has perfect

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tBut the wisdom tooth will have to
tbe pulled?

<b>tttDR. WINTON 
</b>tYes, and it's very bad. It probably
tshould be done at the hospital

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tThat would scare her to death.
tShe's terrified of hospitals. To

approaching.

<b>tttDADDY

him. The CAMERA STAYS on Buddy.

</b>
CUT TO a shot of Buddy going down the hotel stairs. He holds
onto the banister, sliding with his hands far ahead in order
to take four and even five steps at a time -- it is a
childish trick, the point of the game is to touch as few
stairs as possible.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Buddy as he jumps down the last remaining
five steps and walks into the lobby. Daddy comes from behind
the desk, grim.

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in the Model-A. Daddy stares
grimly ahead. Buddy steals a worried glance at him.

<b>INT. LOCAL JAIL - DAY
</b>
CUT TO a shot in the local jail. The shot is on Daddy as he
stands before jail bars staring sternly into a cell. His
hands are on his hips, his straw hat is on the back of his
head and a bit to one side. Buddy stands beside him, a little
bit behind, a worried look on his face. The CHIEF OF POLICE,
a fat man, is on the other side of Daddy.

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose in the cell. Her hair is mussed,
her dress is torn. A little innocent, frightened smile is on
her face. The CAMERA PANS to include Daddy and the Chief of
Police.

<b>tttCHIEF OF POLICE 
</b>tThat was a awful brawl down at the

</b>tYes, I know the son of a bitch.

</b>tSon of a bitch is right, he dern

tAs for that policeman, I didn't

In dour silence, Daddy and the Chief of Police stare at Rose.
She gives them a little smile, as if to say, "See how
innocent I am?" The Chief turns to Daddy and asks with dry
irony:

<b>tttCHIEF OF POLICE 
</b>tWell, she's your girl, Mr. Hillyer.

badly frightened and still coughing. Finally she ventures a
little smile and speaks to Daddy.

A SHOT of Buddy and Doll in the living room of the Hillyer
home at night. Doll is half-heartedly practicing scales on
the piano and Buddy is pacing the floor, hands clasped behind
him in something like the style of his father. As the CAMERA
FOLLOWS Buddy in his pacing we see Waski playing with marbles
on the floor.

CUT TO a shot of Buddy coming with great furtiveness from the

tiptoes across the hall and bows down and listens at the door
of his mother's bedroom-study. He crouches down, peeps
through the keyhole.

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM/STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
CUT TO a "keyhole shot" of Daddy and Mother in the bedroom.
Mother sits in her study chair, a handkerchief to her eyes.
Daddy sits in a chair nearby. He looks depressed.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tI'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as
tmuch as you do.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tt(wanly)
tWell, she does seem to cause a lot
tof trouble, I admit. But she
tdoesn't mean any harm and it'll
tbreak the children's hearts, they

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tIt's because of the children she's
tgot to go. I don't want to be
tholier-than-thou, but the girl
tdoesn't have the same outlook we
tdo. Morals don't mean a thing to
ther, not a thing, and we can't have
ta girl like that in this house.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tWho is to say our morals are better
tthan hers?
tt(frowns, sighs)
tBut maybe you're right. She
tcould... influence Dolly...

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tThat is exactly what I'm afraid of. 
tt(pauses, and firmly)
tThe girl has got to go, darlin'.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tBut morals come from the heart, not
tfrom rigid rules and empty laws.
tAnd in her heart Rose has never
thurt anyone and she never would.
tTherefore, she's not immoral. Not
treally.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tNow look, darlin', this is no time
tto go off into the fourth
tdimension.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tBut what I said is the simple
ttruth. And now I see something

Mother has a slightly "other-worldly" look on her face. Daddy
glances at the door of the bedroom, he suspects something.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tJust a moment, darlin'.

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

alacrity, he jumps up and hurries across the hall and shuts
the living room door just as Daddy whisks open the bedroom
door. Daddy grimaces.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tCould of sworn that boy was out
there.

Daddy shuts the door and at once almost like the movement of
a ballet Buddy opens the living room door and tiptoes back to
the keyhole.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tHow could Rose really be a bad

<b>tttDADDY

</b>tIf you mean sex, you couldn't be

Rose lies in a hospital bed. The nurse, mother, Daddy, Buddy,
Doll and Waski enter, all of them looking very grave.

leave, all looking depressed.

<b>INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

man with a spade beard. He has a superior, patronizing way of
talking and very little Southern accent if any. The scene is
his office and he is in a swivel chair behind his desk.

the Hillyer children.

</b>tShe looks terrible, just awful.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tOf course she does and I must say
tI'm puzzled by your delay in

tA tenant farm? Are you trying to

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tWell, her people were very poor.
tShe says she was often hungry as a
tchild, and I'm sure the food she
tate was pretty awful, not a

tthe girl's illness at the moment,
tshe is very strong, a very healthy
tspecimen of a young human female --

CUT TO A POV SHOT of Dr. Martinson with his black bag in hand
and shoulders hunched coming down the stairs. The man is

on a new and modest little dress that Mother evidently has

Rose casually pulls the dress over her head and stands there
in panties and bra, oblivious of Buddy and the children. She
has about as much modesty as a small child herself.

tBesides, there ain't no Mr. Right

It is Hawkshaw the Detective and his Unwilling Assistant.
Daddy solemnly points to dim marks in the flower bed.

there.

tcould prove it was his shoes if you

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy back in the garage. They are
scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the
garage. All Daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead
ringer for Sherlock Holmes. He is in dead earnest about this,
it is no Joke and he does not dream of being funny.

tSee, son? The paint is flaked off
there, freshly. Look at it, Brother,

tIn the shock of this brilliant

Rose lifts her dress and Daddy leans forward eagerly to
confirm his belief. Rose stands there with her skirt lifted.
She has on a pair of skimpy white panties. An unmistakable,
definite protrusion can be seen in the area below her navel
just above the line of her panties. A stupefied look is on
Daddy's face.

CUT TO a shot of Dr. Martinson's private office in his home,
quite a bit more luxurious than his office at the hospital. A
sober-looking Mother and Daddy sit talking to him. He almost
seems to relish the situation.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tI'm not surprised you thought she
twas pregnant. An ovarian cyst can
tlook very much like pregnancy. But
tit was pure wishful thinking on her
tpart. The girl can never have
tchildren, she had gonorrhea at
tfifteen and it was untreated.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(shocked, rather feebly)
tGonorrhea?

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tDon't worry, Madam, she can't
tinfect your dear little kiddies.
tShe long ago fully recovered, but
tthe disease did irreparable damage.
tThe girl is permanently barren.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tWell, that's pathetic. Poor Rose,
twhat a life she has had.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tWe make our own lives, Madam. As
tfor malignancy, I don't think so,
tit's very unlikely. I probably
tshouldn't have even mentioned that
tpossibility to her.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(rather coldly, seems
tt disenchanted with him)
tNo, you shouldn't have, it was
tneedlessly cruel. She thinks she
thas cancer and is going to die.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON
</b>tShe's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was
tmerely giving her the facts.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tWell, it's a disaster. I don't know
twhat to say, Doctor, I am floored.
tHow dangerous is the operation?

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tAny major operation is dangerous.
tHowever, as we know from her
tprevious illness, she's a very
tstrong girl.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tWell, if it isn't malignant and she
tcan get through the operation all
tright, it might be better than her
treally being pregnant. She doesn't
teven know who the father might have
tbeen.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tOh, it's definitely better, beyond

considered a polecat.

Mother and Daddy.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tI'm sorry the truth nauseates you,
tMrs. Hillyer, because before you
tleave there's a bit more of it I'd
tlike to put to you. This operation
tprovides a therapeutic opportunity
tthat I feel is quite important in
tregard to this particular girl, who
tsuffers not only from an ovarian
tcyst but from a certain
tpsychoneurotic condition as well.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tWhat do you mean, what kind of
tgobbledygook talk is that?

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tGo ahead, Doctor, I think I am
tfollowing you.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tt(gives Mother an aloof
tt glance, then to Daddy)
tFirst, about the girl's history.
tEvidently she's been very
tpromiscuous since early childhood,
tshe has no control over her sexual
timpulses. Furthermore, she is
tpermanently barren, she can't have
tchildren.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tGo on, Doctor.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tt(quietly)
tYes, go on.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tI am thinking particularly of the
tother ovary. As a rule I don't
tbelieve in removing it. The woman's
thormonal system is profoundly
tdisturbed, she is subject to
tpossibly serious depression, she
tloses many of her secondary sexual
tcharacteristics for example, her
tbreasts might shrink and become
tflabby, facial hair might appear
talong with a coarsening of the
tfeatures, and of course her sexual
tdrive is greatly diminished,
tespecially in a girl or young
twoman. For these reasons I am
topposed to removing the other
tovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tI am ahead of you.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tThen... may I speak quite frankly
twith you, Mr. Hillyer?

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tPlease do.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tI have of course observed the girl
tin treating her.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tOf course.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tI think we both know her.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tYes, we know her.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tWhat are you talking about? I don't
tunderstand all this mumbo jumbo and
tthe funny looks on your faces.

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tMrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in
tmore ways than one. She is an
textreme psychoneurotic with
tuncontrollable sexual impulses. It
twould be a mercy to spare her the
tsuffering she causes herself and
tothers. Therefore I recommend as a
ttherapeutic measure the removal of
ther second ovary. It is ethically
tand medically the only proper
tdecision in this case and I suspect
tyour husband agrees with me.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tReluctantly, I do. It would be a
tblessing to her and everyone else.
tThe girl is oversexed and I say --
tspay her!

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(slowly rises to her feet
tt and in a trembling voice)
tOver... my... dead... body!

A long, frozen pause as both Daddy and Dr. Martinson stare at
Mother in surprise. She stares at the Doctor with fire in her
eyes. He seems already to shrink a little. Finally she speaks
with a calm fury.

<b>tttMOTHER (CONT'D)
</b>tAre you human beings or are you
tsome kind of male monsters? Is
tthere no limit to which you won't
tgo to keep your illusions about
tyourselves?

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tt(shrinking a little)
tIllusions, Madam?

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tYou'd go so far as to mutilate a
thelpless girl who has no means to
tdefend herself, you'd go that far?
tDon't you think I know what you've
tjust said and don't you think I
tunderstand the dreadful and
trevolting crime you've just
tconspired to commit?

Dr. Martinson stares at her in fear and shock, intimidated by
the calm fury and ice-cold moral indignation.

He opens his mouth as if to speak, but no sound comes out.
Mother turns to Daddy.

<b>tttMOTHER (CONT'D)
</b>tI thought I knew you. I thought I
tknew you better, I thought in your
theart you were a good and kind man.
tWell, I can't believe what I've
tjust heard in this room. A
tdefenseless girl depending on you
tfor protection, and you propose to
tmutilate and destroy her. How could
tyou listen even for a moment to
tthat sadistic man?

<b>tttDADDY
</b>tt(slightly shattered)
tWell, now, darlin'... give me a
tchance to defend myself.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tI can't believe you really meant
tit, if I did I'd want to die. You
taren't a male monster, that man is
tbut you aren't. Look me in the eye
tand tell me, do you really want to
ttake Rose's womanhood away from her
twhen it's all she has got?

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tWell, I... I hadn't thought about
tit that much. I was thinking...
twell, it's an idea, the girl is
toversexed, and...

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tRose isn't oversexed, that's
tridiculous. If you're going to talk
tnonsense, I don't want to talk to
tyou at all. Rose is exactly the
tsame as the rest of us, except more
tso.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tWell, I know, more so. That's why I
twas thinking... maybe she'd be
tbetter off.

<b>tttMOTHER
</b>tt(with a quiet fury)
tBetter off? How could she ever find
tlove and happiness, if you did what
tyou're talking about? Are you
tinsane?

<b>tttDR. MARTINSON 
</b>tt(rather feebly)
tNow, may I say, I am against that
tparticular procedure, as a general
trule. But in a case of near
tnymphomania, it doesn't seem
tmonstrous to me at all, but
tmedically advisable.

Both Mother and Daddy totally ignore him. Mother's eyes are
fixed on Daddy and he is struggling with himself, staring
down at the floor.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tWell, now, I admit... in Rose's
tcase, it would be cruel. If Rose
twasn't attractive and pretty...
twell, it would probably be bad for
talmost any young woman. I don't
tknow exactly what I was thinking
tabout, the doctor said it and it
tsounded reasonable.

Daddy finally looks up at Mother and admits his error like a
man.

<b>tttDADDY (CONT'D)
</b>tBut you're right, darlin', you're
tabsolutely dead right, it would be
tan awful and horrible thing to do.
tI'm sorry, honey, forgive me, I
tdidn't mean it.

Mother turns from Daddy and walks up to the desk and stares
down at Dr. Martinson as if he is a loathesome bug upon which
she intends to step.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tI will not cry like a woman. If I'm
tupset it's because of what my
thusband said, not because of you.
tYou can't make me cry like a woman,
ta woman has got just as much
tintelligence and self-control as a

tIf you hurt that girl, I'll hire

tActually of course I won't operate,

at night as it drives up and stops before the front steps.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Rose and Dave Wilkie in the car. Here
DAVE is much YOUNGER, of course, and a rather handsome man in
a stolid way. Even though he is younger than when we saw him
on the plane, he is quite a bit older than Rose. Rose's eyes
are opened wide, she is a bit breathless, obviously something
important has happened. Dave stares at her as if fascinated,
almost as if awed.

tI want to thank you for a wonderful

is stiff and solemn in his best suit. Daddy gravely gives
Rose away. We hear no dialogue here, MUSIC on track. We see
Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the front row, all in Sunday
best and very solemn. We see a CLOSE SHOT of Rose's knees
trembling beneath her white wedding dress as a country
minister marries them. VARIOUS SHOTS of a rather idyllic

church, and...

A shot of Rose, Dave, Buddy, Doll and Waski at a picnic

The scene should be beautiful in summertime. We see a
barbecue pit, homemade ice cream in the metal can, other
picnic things. A happy Rose is kissing first Buddy, then
Doll, then Waski. Dave smiles fondly, but rather stiffly at
her.

<b>tttROSE 
</b>tAnd now Waski, are you and Buddy

</b>tWell, thank God we are rid of her

</b>tWell, yes, she's happy. Of course
tDave doesn't have her life force,

twhereas Rose has furniture coming
tout of the windows.

</b>tHoney, he is Mr. Right.

<b>tttMOTHER 
</b>tt(slowly nods)
tYes, I think so. He adores her,

</b>tWhat do you think, Brother?

Mother frowns in surprise.

CUT TO a POV shot of Buddy on the back seat of the car. Now
it is clear why we couldn't see him in the other shot. Be is
lying down on the seat of the car with his Sunday coat pulled
over his head.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother and Buddy, Doll, Waski. Buddy lies on
the seat, motionless with his coat over his head.

</b>tt(seems awed, staring down

tI don't know. I think he's cryin'!

CUT TO ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother, from the front as she slowly
turns back and stares thoughtfully ahead. The shot is also on
Daddy. They both stare ahead in pensive silence. Finally
Mother speaks.

<b>INT./EXT. HERTZ CAR ON INTERSTATE - DAY
</b>
ON Willcox Hillyer behind the wheel of the Hertz car. He is
staring pensively ahead, a faint trace of tears in his eyes.
It is a very faint trace, a look of mild irony and amusement
is on his face.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tt(dryly, to himself)

Willcox slowly shakes his head.

<b>EXT. HERTZ CAR - BUSTLING CITY - DAY
</b>
CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it drives into a rather
bustling little Southern city that does not look at all like
the "Glenville" we have seen. A lot of traffic, new roads,
filling stations, prosperity. It could be Rome, Georgia as it
is today.

<b>EXT. CAR PAST HOLIDAY INN - DAY
</b>
ANOTHER SHOT of the red Ford going past a modern Holiday Inn
in the city.

<b>EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY
</b>
ON the red Ford as it turns into a familiar driveway, that of
the old Hillyer home.

But insofar as possible it looks different now, like a relic
from the past.
Maybe the house needs painting, the garden is in weeds -- the
place is not exactly dilapidated, but it is marked by time.

A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he gets out of the red Ford and
walks up the familiar steps of the front porch, travel bag in
hand.

</b>
CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer as he glances into the
living room. The room looks the same but different -it is
musty, dim.

Willcox Hillyer stares at it as if haunted a bit, turns and
the CAMERA follows him as he crosses the hall and looks into
Mother's old bedroom-study. This room is quite different. The
four poster is gone. The room is dusty, musty, dark.
Magazines are on the floor in a ring around Mother's old
study chair. We see "male" things. It is apparent Daddy lives
alone in this room.

A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he walks down the familiar hall
back to the kitchen.

<b>INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
He looks around. No one is there. He glances at a modern
refrigerator that is in pretty poor shape, glances with a
frown at dishes in the sink unwashed. He goes on out to the
patio.

<b>EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY
</b>
CUT TO a shot of Daddy putting out seed for birds on a table
on the patio. Daddy now is a very old man, but his
personality and style are the same as ever. He looks up with
a stern frown as Willcox Hillyer comes out on the patio.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tWell, you rascal, where'd you come
tfrom?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tHello, Daddy. How are you?

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tHow could that be, son?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tDave Wilkie of all people was
tsitting by me on the plane -- her
tfirst husband. It's funny you would
tmention Rose. Did you hear from

Willcox pours out whisky.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tt(casually)
tWell, yes, in a manner of speaking.
tYou'll have the back bedroom, son,

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tOh, I heard from her, I got a

tRose is fine. Let's sit down, son.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tIs her husband sick or something?

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tNo, it's another thing. I was going
tto write you about it, but since
tyou were coming down anyway I
tthought I'd wait till you got here.
tWhat did Dave Wilkie have to say?

ANOTHER ANGLE on Willcox Hillyer and the aged Daddy as they
sit on the patio sipping whisky. Willcox Hillyer is not
disturbed or worried about Rose, Daddy has been very casual
and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news
really is.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tThe pitiful son of a bitch said
tRose was a nymphomaniac.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tUm-hmm, and I suppose that incensed
tyou?

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tYou're damn right it incensed me,

<b>tttDADDY
</b>tt(nods somberly)
tYeah, I know, he was up here. It's

tRose.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER 
</b>tHe didn't lose her, he threw her
taway.

tOr maybe it isn't so funny.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tt(as if in previous

tI'm older than hell, boy. But this

tsay that.

<b>tttWILLCOX HILLYER
</b>tAll right, Daddy. We have our

tBut... but how? She was young! Rose

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tShe was fifty-six, son. Of course

<b>SHOT OF THE PATIO

ON Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as the former walks up with his
refreshed drink and sits down. He is in control now, his face
is expressionless and he is seemingly calm.

<b>tttDADDY 
</b>tIt's true, son. The girl with the

Daddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on
himself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerful
feeling is behind his words.

<b>tttDADDY (CONT'D)
</b>tShe got cancer of the breast, was

ttwenty-five years held her hand.
tThat is what happened, son, and God

to control himself, tears are in his eyes. He clenches his
teeth, takes a big swallow of his drink.
