<b>t1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN
</b>
tIt is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through 
tthe jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the 
ttrees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.

tOur VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to 
tthe tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
tthen another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to 
temerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set 
tof beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, 
tin a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." 
tThe head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier 
tbeneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no 
tshirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
tpainted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the 
tright; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
tslowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.

tOur VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though 
tunrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
tWe PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
tswamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
tin the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
tAs we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow 
tand houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
tin a paisley design.

tNow the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
tthe glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
tambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
tACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
tpajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
tTheir feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
tno sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
teyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.

tThe VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
tAND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
tabout ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
tand bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
tcasually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
tlaconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
tUS. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out 
twith AUTOMATIC FIRE.

tOut VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
tscreaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
tappear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
twe fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
tSome wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
tfeathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
tsavage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
tthey wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
tThey wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
tbodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
tThey appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
tas they move.

tThe soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
tmud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.

tWe begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
trunning for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
tonly to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
tpainted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
tFALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
tand EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
taround us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
tare piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
tfrightened.

tAn AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
ton it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
tTOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
tdead.

tOUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
tVietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
tstopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
twith primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
tand green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
tand the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
tbright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
telectric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :


tt<u>MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW</u>


<b>t2  TITLE SEQUENCE
</b>
tThe CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, 
tgrowing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
ttransforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
tlook at, like the sun itself.

tThen it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
tagain. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
tis as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
tcooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
tdistant. The TITLES CONTINUE.

tWe are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
tstars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
tMUSIC  now.

tWe MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
tas though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.

tWe are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
tclose enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
tCLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
tLos Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like
tshapes of :


<b>t3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY
</b>
tThe VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
tcruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

tIt is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
tbathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
tcocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
thead of a large American Corporation, and this is his
tparty. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
tcatch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
tsmeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
tpaint. Charlie is going on and on :

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>tt... It's crazy -- sugar is up to
tt200 dollars a ton -- sugar !

<b>ttttLAWYER
</b>ttWhat about oil ?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttFood, oil --look, let me show you
ttsomething. This is the economy of
ttthe United States in two years --

tHe takes a newspaper, draws a circle.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThis is West Germany.
ttt(he draws another,
ttt bigger circle)
ttThis is Japan.
ttt(another , bigger)
ttThis is Italy.
ttt(a dot)
ttThis is Iran.
ttt(a very big circle)
ttAnd this is Saudi Arabia... In
tttwo years ?
ttt(a gigantic circle)
ttDo you understand ?

<b>ttttACCOUNTANT
</b>ttWhat's to prevent it ?

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttMaybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
ttI didn't build a two-billion-dollar
ttcompany in the last twenty years
ttby doing nothing. We can protect
ttour interests.
ttt(pause, for a drink)
ttWe are still the most powerful
ttnation in the world. Militarily.

tHe leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttYou know bodyguard; he was a
ttcaptain in Viet Nam. You talk to
tthim, except he won't talk. This
ttkind of man can kill you with his
ttpinky. A nice quiet fella, though.

tThe VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.

<b>ttttCHARLIE
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttCarries a attache case at all
tttimes. You know what's in it ?
ttt(another sip)
ttAn Ingram Machine pistol.

tGradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a
tNEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

<b>ttCHARLIEtttttWILLARD (V.O.)
</b>tI don't tahe chances, andtttBullshit. You can kill
tneither should this country.tttwith the ridge of your

tThe VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :
tPictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the
tgood life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.

<b>ttttWILLARD (V.O.)
</b>ttThe attache case has been empty
ttfor three years, but it makes him
ttsafe to think there's a machine
ttpistol in it.

ttI don't like automatic weapons.
ttThey jam.

ttI saw a friend of mine get
ttripped open because he flicked his
ttM-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
ttHow much money did the contractors
ttmake on the M-16 ?

tOur VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some
treading, flirting, drinking.

<b>ttttWILLARD (V.O.)
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttHe likes to hear stories about Nam.
ttI tell him I can't; they're not
ttcleared. The truth is he wouldn't
ttunderstand.

tWe can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the
topposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We 
<b>tMOVE CLOSER.
</b>
<b>ttttWILLARD (V.O.)
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThere's no way I can tell them...
ttwhat really happened over there.

ttI wouldn't've believed it if
ttsomeone'd told me.

tWe are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips
tfrom a beer, but we cannot see his face.

<b>ttttWILLARD (V.O.)
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttThere was only one part that
ttmattered -- for me, anyway. I
ttdon't even know if I remember
ttall of it. I can't remember
tthow it ended, exactly -- because
ttwhen it ended I was insane.

<b>t4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY
</b>
tA Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and
tshops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.
tOur VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.
tWILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed
tby four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his
tshoes and sell him things.

<b>ttttWILLARD (V.O.)
</b>ttBut I know how it started
ttfor me -- I was on R. and R.

tWillard ducks into a bar.


<b>t7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY
</b>
tNot much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few
ttables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly
tcrowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly
tpast the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching
tsight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

tAn INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of
tdrinks and approaches Willard's table.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttHow about a drink ?

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttSure, thanks.

tHe sits down at the table with the drinks.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttWinning the war by yourself.

<b>ttttWILLARD

ttPart.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttWhich part is that ?

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttMy part.

</b>ttNo.

</b>ttNorth ?

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttYeah. Way north.

</b>ttWhat unit were you with ?

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttNone.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttRangers, eh?

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttSort of.

tThe JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over
this shoulder.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttWere you Longe Range Recon --

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttNo -- I worked too far north for
<b>ttLRRP.
</b>
tHe reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the
tCaptain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard
tnotices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,
tthen enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttThat's quite an array of ribbons...

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttLet's talk about you.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttI was an FO for the 25th.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttTracks ?

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttFat. That's real fat.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttSometimes.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttAt least you always have enough
ttwater. How many gallons does
tteach one of those damn things
ttcarry ?

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttThirty -- sometimes fifty.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttYou know, I can remember once,
ttgetting back below the DMZ -- and
ttthe first Americans we ran into
ttwere a track squadron. I just
ttcouldn't believe how much water
ttthey had. We'd been chewing
ttbamboo shoots for almost a week,
ttand before that, for two weeks,
ttwe'd been drinking anything --
ttrain water, river shit, stuff
ttright out of the paddies. And
ttthere were these guys standing
ttby their trucks spilling water
ttall over. I could've killed them.
ttt(solemnly)
ttI swear to God I would have, too,
ttif ...

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttI didn't know we had units up
ttthere in North Vietnam.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttWe do.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttHow long were you up there ?

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttA long time.

<b>ttttCAPTAIN
</b>ttA year ? Waiter another beer.

</b>ttI go up on missions. Listen

ttyou want, but you better tell
ttthat asshole over there you're
ttnot going to find out anymore
ttabout me.

tWillard glances over his shoulder and indicates the
tCivilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.
tHe rises and comes over to the bar.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttWhat do you want ?

<b>ttttCIVILIAN
</b>ttt(indicating the Army jeep)
ttIf you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttWho are you ?

<b>ttttCIVILIAN
</b>ttThe agency.

tWillard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks
troght out toward the jeep without saying another word.
tThe Civilian follows.


<b>t8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK
</b>
tA darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle
tbefore emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed
twire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
tfortified, concealed compound.

<b>ttttWILLARD (V.O.)
</b>ttThey took me to some place outside
ttNha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
ttfor all operations in South East Asia.
ttI'd worked for Intelligence before --

tArmed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A
tlarge camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground
tcorridor -- they enter.


<b>t9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM
</b>
tA door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to
tattention, blocking the view of the room. A strange
treddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic
tmaps and filled with smoke.

tThe whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
tand there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly
treclaiming it.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttCaptain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
ttreporting as ordered, sir.

<b>ttttCOLONEL (O.S.)
</b>ttOkay, Willard, sit down.

tWillard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
tbare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks
tand tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL
tputs his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind
thim sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.

<b>ttttCOLONEL
</b>ttHave you ever seen this officer
ttbefore, Captain Willard ?

tHe points to the Major.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttNo, sir.

<b>ttttCOLONEL
</b>ttThis gentleman or myself ?

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttNo, sir.

<b>ttttCOLONEL
</b>ttI believe on your last job you
ttexecuted a tax collector in Kontum,
ttis that right ?

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttI am not presently disposed to
ttdiscuss that, sir.

<b>ttttMAJOR
</b>ttVery good.

tHe turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The
tColonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.

<b>ttttCOLONEL
</b>ttYou know much about about Special Forces;
ttGreen Berets, Captain ?

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttI've worked with them on occasions
ttand I saw the movie , sir.

tThe officer smiles at this.

<b>ttttCOLONEL
</b>ttThen you can appreciate Command's
ttconcern over their -- shall we say
tt'erratic' methods of operation.
ttt(pause)
ttI have never favored elite units,
ttCaptain, including your paratroopers
ttor whatever. Just because a man
ttjumps out of an airplane or wears
tta silly hat doesn't give him any
ttpriviliges in my book -- not in
ttthis man's army.

<b>ttttMAJOR
</b>ttWe didn't need 'em in Korea --
ttno sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
ttand an M-1 Garand, none of this
ttfancy crap -- no sir.

</b>ttt(stopping him)
ttMajor.

<b>ttttCOLONEL
</b>ttWe have Special Forces A
ttdetachments all along the
ttCambodian border. Two here and
ttanother one here -- twelve or
ttfourteen Americans -- pretty
ttmuch on their own; they train
ttand motivate Montagnard natives;
ttpick their own operations. If
ttthey need something, they call 
ttfor it, and get it within
ttreason. What we're concerned
ttwith is here.

</b>ttThe A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
ttIt was originally a larger base,

tThe Major looks at some papers in front of him.

<b>ttttMAJOR
</b>ttCommunications naturally dwindled
ttwith the lack of V.C. activity,
ttthis is routine, expected ... but
ttsix months ago communication
ttvirtually stopped.

<b>ttttCOLONEL
</b>ttAbout the same time -- large numbers
ttof Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
ttbegan leaving the area -- this in
ttitself is not unusual since these
ttpeople have fought with the Rhade
ttTribe that lived in the area for
ttcenturies. But what is unusual is
ttthat we began to find Rhade refugees
tttoo -- in the same sampans as the
ttM'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
ttof V.C. They've put up with war
ttfor twenty years -- but something
ttis driving them out.

<b>ttttMAJOR
</b>ttWe communicate with the base
ttinfrequently. What they call for
ttare air strikes, immediate --
ttalways at night. And we don't
ttknow what or who the air strikes
ttare called on.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttWho ?

<b>ttttMAJOR
</b>ttYou see, no one has really gone
ttinto this area and come back alive.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttWhy me ?

<b>ttttMAJOR
</b>ttWalter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,

tHe puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.

tThe Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,
tflicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the

ttI thought he was a lame.

<b>ttttCOLONEL
</b>ttA lame ?

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttThis is years ago, before he

ttWe had an argument.

</b>ttMaybe.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttMaybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
ttbelieve he's capable of that.
ttI just don't believe it.

<b>ttttCOLONEL
</b>ttIt's got to be Kurtz.

<b>ttttCIVILIAN
</b>ttThe point is that Kurtz or
ttsomebody attacked a South

<b>ttttCIVILIAN
</b>ttExactly -- you'll go up the

tsee and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far
tsurpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,

tthe moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing
tthis are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the

tstep out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this
tabates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He
tis the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed
timpeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal

tforward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,
twhich is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he
thas seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke
tgrenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,
tthen the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black

ta lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters
tpull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump
tfrom the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,
tstrong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and
tneatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE
t-- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.

tHe crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It
tis no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He

tLance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another

tdrowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the
tdeafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the
ttree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are
tmaking a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-
tling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance
tgoes further downriver through the black smoke and there
tmerging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.

tthe probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand
tgestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move
tstealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the
thunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,
tand remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket
tnoise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges
tout along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to
tpoint the finger of that hand and he will hit what he
twants. He makes another command and they rush the

tsticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the

tthrough the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere --
tscurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge
tor tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light
tautomatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R.

</b>ttWake up the Roach.

tThe Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is

tupon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
tvertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
tthe mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
tdizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
tup around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
tonce under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
tgateway to paradise.

tThe river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
tseductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
torange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
tThe water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
twere no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
tand laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
tpeaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
tit and has never known such a sense of peace and well-

tEach man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
tcries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into

tHere is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.
tThe boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of

tthe small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-

tA thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the
tfort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near
tthe dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-
tmerged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some
tof them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the

<b>t228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW
</b>
tAs they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear
twhere a moment before there was only jungle.

tThey are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
tthan any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
tand bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
tin strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
tAK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
temerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
tequally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
tare a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
tof Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
tif anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
tthe entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
twhere thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
tthe sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
tprimitive and more savage than any since the time
tof Captain Cook.

tThey encounter, in the center of the group, what once
tappears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
twears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
tloincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
tstrange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
tlong, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47
tdecorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches
tthis beast, who seems shy and retiring.

</b>ttWho are you?

<b>ttttMOONBY
</b>ttt(breaking in)
ttHis name is...

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttI'm not ever goin' to tell you
ttto shut up again.

tMoonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing
tcomes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they
tare to see him.

<b>ttttMAN

</b>ttNVA regulars. They're coming

tWillard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what
tto say to this man, but he understands the forces that
tpounded him. He takes his arm.

tSix months later, and he and Colby would be identical.

</b>ttOh, no, donxb4t say that.

</b>ttTake us back. Take us back !
ttBut, the operation -- the team.
ttColonel Kurtz has such plans for
tt-- the team.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttTake me to him, Major.

tColby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on
tpoles, he turns, agitated, to Willard:

<b>ttttCOLBY
</b>ttI had nothing to do with these
ttoperations -- I did not do the
ttplanning -- none of us did.
ttIt was all Colonel Kurtz -- he
ttwas the genius. You'll see --
ttthe genius of our Colonel. He
ttshould be made a General, don't
ttyou think? A General? It's...

tSuddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard
tknows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

tKurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is
ta powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly
tattempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,
tthough it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with
tprimitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
twell as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,
twith long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes
talmost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what
tseems to be a serious wound.


<b>t232  VIEW ON WILLARD
</b>
tThis is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then,
tautomatically, he comes to an attention.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttColonel Kurtz, I guess.

</b>
tThere is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair.
tBut behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on
tthe ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well.
tThen Kurtz does.

tMoonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to
tKurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from
tman to man, ritualistically.

<b>ttttKURTZ
</b>ttt(slowly)
ttWhy did you come to ... my province.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttWe were attacked -- down river.

</b>ttt(finding it more and

ttNo -- no, sir.

<b>ttttKURTZ
</b>ttYou came up my river -- in that

ttalways thought the final justice
ttwould come from the sky, like

</b>ttYou know you're right.

tThere is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.

<b>ttttKURTZ
</b>ttThen the Agency approached you.
ttMaybe in a bar in Quinon or
ttPleiku. Simple. A year's pay
ttfor one life. Perhaps a village

ttNobody's orders but your own.
ttExciting work.

</b>ttYou've spent tome at the Royal
ttTracking School of Malaysia.
ttI can tell from the way the
ttlaces on your boots are tied.
ttI understand you, Captain. We
ttunderstand each other.

tThere is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other.
tThen Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws
tit, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act
tassuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttDo you know me?

<b>ttttKURTZ
</b>ttYes.

tKurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another
tword or gesture, shoots and kills a man.

<b>ttttKURTZ
</b>tttt(continuing)
ttDo you know <u>me</u> ?

tHe throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks
tback into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
theads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful
tdistance behind. Even Willard is stunned.

tWillard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged
tand dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar
templacement.

tWild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow
tto Willard as he passes.

</b>ttThis is good -- triple overlapping

tA woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then
truns off to her bunker.

tWE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups
tof people, huddled by their fires... men, women and
tchildren. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from
tevery hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried
tscalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on
ta big piece of almost raw meat.

<b>ttttWILLARD
</b>ttt(continuing)
ttI've done things, when I was
ttalone in the jungle -- that I
ttnever told anyone about.

tThey continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
thalf a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and
tfortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck
tlays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted
tthere sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is
tbuilt on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
tfire into the jungle beyond.

tSome Americans, barely recognizible because of their
tbeards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several
tMontagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
tbayonets.

tsteps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.

tAn austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-
tquarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the
tancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other
tmilitary charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,
tbut have now fallen into decayed disuse.

tThere are other indications of the modern headquarters
tthis had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-
ttant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.
tThere is a large wooden planning table next to him, with
tmaps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically
tgarbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil
tspirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging
tfromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche
t"Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."

tMoonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to
tWillard.

<b>ttttMOONBY
</b>ttHe's asleep -- don't bother him.

tA SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted

tBURST  around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly
tloud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid
tstream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as
t7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of
tthe lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-

tSuddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce

tThey stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one

tgun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his
tholster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz
tbeats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He
tmoves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding
tit at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls
tand FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and
trush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly
tencircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The
tmachine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty
tand the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.
