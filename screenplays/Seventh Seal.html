

<pre>The Seventh Seal
<b> 
</b>The night had brought little relief from the heat, and at dawn a hot gust of
wind blows across the colorless sea. The KNIGHT, Antonius Block, lies
prostrate on some spruce branches spread over the fine sand. His eyes are 
wide-open and bloodshot from lack of sleep. 

Nearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly. He has fallen asleep where he 
collapsed, at the edge of the forest among the wind-gnarled fir trees. His 
open mouth gapes towards the dawn, and unearthly sounds come from his throat.
At the sudden gust of wind, the horses stir, stretching their parched muzzles 
towards the sea. They are as thin and worn as their masters.

The KNIGHT has risen and waded into the shallow water, where he rinses his 
sunburned face and blistered lips. JONS rolls over to face the forest and the 
darkness. He moans in his sleep and vigorously scratches the stubbled hair on 
his head. A scar stretches diagonally across his scalp, as white as lightning 
against the grime. 

The KNIGHT returns to the beach and falls on his knees. With his eyes closed 
and brow furrowed, he says his morning prayers. His hands are clenched 
together and his lips form the words silently. His face is sad and bitter. He 
opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from 
the misty sea like some bloated, dying fish. The sky is gray and immobile, a 
dome of lead. A cloud hangs mute and dark over the western horizon. High up, 
barely visible, a seagull floats on motionless wings. Its cry is weird and 
restless. The KNIGHT'S large gray horse lifts its head and whinnies. Antonius 
Block turns around.

Behind him stands a man in black. His face is very pale and he keeps his 
hands hidden in the wide folds of his cloak. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWho are you? 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttI am Death.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttHave you come for me?

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttI have been walking by your side for a long 
tttime. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThat I know. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttAre you prepared?

<b>ttttKNIGHT
</b>ttMy body is frightened, but I am not. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttWell, there is no shame in that.

The KNIGHT has risen to his feet. He shivers. DEATH opens his cloak to place 
it around the KNIGHT'S shoulders. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWait a moment.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttThat's what they all say. I grant no reprieves. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYou play chess, don't you?

A gleam of interest kindles in DEATH'S eyes. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttHow did you know that?

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI have seen it in paintings and heard it sung 
ttin ballads.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttYes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttBut you can't be better than I am.

The KNIGHT rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes 
out a small chessboard. He places it carefully on the ground and begins 
setting up the pieces.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttWhy do you want to play chess with me? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI have my reasons. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttThat is your privilege.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThe condition is that I may live as long as I 
tthold out against you. If I win, you will 
ttrelease me. Is it agreed? 

The KNIGHT holds out his two fists to DEATH, who smiles at him suddenly. 
DEATH points to one of the KNIGHT'S hands; it contains a black pawn. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYou drew black!

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttVery appropriate. Don't you think so?

The KNIGHT and DEATH bend over the chessboard. After a moment of hesitation, 
Antonius Block opens with his king's pawn. DEATH moves, also using his king's 
pawn.
<b> 
</b>

The morning breeze has died down. The restless movement of the sea has 
ceased, the water is silent. The sun rises from the haze and its glow 
whitens. The sea gull floats under the dark cloud, frozen in space. The day 
is already scorchingly hot.

The squire JONS is awakened by a kick in the rear. Opening his eyes, he 
grunts like a pig and yawns broadly. He scrambles to his feet, saddles his 
horse and picks up the heavy pack.

The KNIGHT slowly rides away from the sea, into the forest near the beach and 
up towards the road. He pretends not to hear the morning prayers of his 
squire. JONS soon overtakes him.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttt(sings)
t tBetween a strumpet's legs to lie 
ttIs the life for which I sigh.

He stops and looks at his master, but the KNIGHT hasn't heard JON'S song, or 
he pretends that he hasn't. To give further vent to his irritation, JONS 
sings even louder. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttt(sings)
ttUp above is God Almighty 
ttSo very far away, 
ttBut your brother the Devil 
ttYou will meet on every level.

JONS finally gets the KNIGHT'S attention. He stops singing. The KNIGHT, his 
horse, JONS'S own horse and JONS himself know all the songs by heart. The 
long, dusty journey from the Holy Land hasn't made them any cleaner. They 
ride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon. Beyond it, the 
sea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttIn Fx89rjestad everyone was talking about evil 
ttomens and other horrible things. Two horses had 
tteaten each other in the night, and, in the 
ttchurchyard, graves had been opened and the 
ttremains of corpses scattered all over the 
ttplace. Yesterday afternoon there were as many 
ttas four suns in the heavens.
<b> 
</b>The KNIGHT doesn't answer. Close by, a scrawny dog is whining, crawling 
towards its master, who is sleeping in a sitting position in the blazing hot 
sun. A black cloud of flies clusters around his head and shoulders. The 
miserable-looking dog whines incessantly as it lies flat on its stomach, 
wagging its tail.

JONS dismounts and approaches the sleeping man. JONS addresses him politely. 
When he doesn't receive an answer, he walks up to the man in order to shake 
him awake. He bends over the sleeping man's shoulder, but quickly pulls back 
his hand. The man falls backward on the heath, his face turned towards JONS. 
It is a corpse, staring at JONS with empty eye sockets and white teeth. 

JONS remounts and overtakes his master. He takes a drink from his waterskin 
and hands the bag to the knight. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWell, did he show you the way? 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttNot exactly.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWhat did he say? 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttNothing.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWas he a mute?

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttNo, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of 
ttfact, he was quite eloquent. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttOh?

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttHe was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that 
ttwhat he had to say was most depressing.
ttt(sings)
ttOne moment you're bright and lively, 
ttThe next you're crawling with worms. 
ttFate is a terrible villain 
ttAnd you, my friend, its poor victim. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttMust you sing? 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttNo.

The KNIGHT hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a 
while. The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle 
down their faces. There is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves. They 
ride past an inlet and along verdant groves. In the shade of some large trees 
stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. A horse whinnies nearby 
and is answered by the KNIGHT'S horse. The two travelers do not stop to rest 
under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the 
bend of the road.
<b> 
</b>

In his sleep, JOF the juggler hears the neighing of his horse and the answer 
from a distance. He tries to go on sleeping, but it is stifling inside the 
wagon. The rays of the sun filtering through the canvas cast streaks of light 
across the face of JOF'S wife, MIA, and their one-year-old son, MIKAEL, who 
are sleeping deeply and peacefully. Near them, JONAS SKAT, an older man, 
snores loudly. 

JOF crawls out of the wagon. There is still a spot of shade under the big 
trees. He takes a drink of water, gargles, stretches and talks to his scrawny 
old horse. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttGood morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't 
tteat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how? 
ttWe're a little hard up. People aren't very 
ttinterested in juggling in this part of the 
ttcountry.

He has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. Then he 
stands on his head and cackles like a hen. Suddenly he stops and sits down 
with a look of utter astonishment on his face. The wind causes the trees to 
sway slightly. The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. The flowers and 
the grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long 
warble.

JOF'S face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. With a dazed 
expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and 
bees and butterflies hum around his head. The unseen bird continues to sing.

Suddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, JOF'S smile fades, 
the flowers and grass wilt in the heat. The old horse is still walking around 
grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies. 

JOF comes to life. He rushes into the wagon and shakes MIA awake.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttMia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen 
ttsomething. I've got to tell you about it!

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttt(sits up, terrified)
ttWhat is it? What's happened? 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttListen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a 
ttvision. It was real, absolutely real.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttOh, so you've had a vision again!

MIA's voice is filled with gentle irony. JOF shakes his head and grabs her by 
the shoulders. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttBut I did see her! 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttWhom did you see? 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttThe Virgin Mary.

MIA can't help being impressed by her husband's fervor. She lowers her voice.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttDid you really see her?

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttShe was so close to me that I could have 
tttouched her. She had a golden crown on her head 
ttand wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She 
ttwas barefoot and had small brown hands with 
ttwhich she was holding the Child and teaching 
ttHim to walk. And then she saw me watching her 
ttand she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears 
ttand when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. 
ttAnd everything became so still in the sky and 
tton the earth. Can you understand ... 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttWhat an imagination you have.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttYou don't believe me! But it was real, I tell 
ttyou, not the kind of reality you see every day, 
ttbut a different kind. 

<b>ttttMIA
</b>ttPerhaps it was the kind of reality you told us 
ttabout when you saw the Devil painting our wagon 
ttwheels red, using his tail as a brush.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttt(embarrassed)
ttWhy must you keep bringing that up? 

<b>ttttMIA
</b>ttAnd then you discovered that you had red paint 
ttunder your nails.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttWell, perhaps that time I made it up. 
ttt(eagerly)  
ttI did it just so that you would believe in my 
ttother visions. The real ones. The ones that I 
ttdidn't make up. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttt(severely)
ttYou have to keep your visions under control.
ttOtherwise people will think that you're a 
tthalf-wit, which you're not. At least not yet -- 
ttas far as I know. But, come to think of it, I'm 
ttnot so sure about that.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttt(angry)
ttI didn't ask to have visions. I can't help it 
ttif voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin 
ttappears before me and angels and devils like my 
ttcompany.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttt(sits up)
ttHaven't I told you once and for all that I need 
ttmy morning's sleep! I have asked you politely, 
ttpleaded with you, but nothing works. So now I'm 
tttelling you to shut up!

His eyes are popping with rage. He turns over and continues snoring where he 
left off. MIA and JOF decide that it would be wisest to leave the wagon. They 
sit down on a crate. MIA has MIKAEL on her knees. He is naked and squirms 
vigorously. JOF sits close to his wife. Slumped over, he still looks dazed 
and astonished. A dry, hot wind blows from the sea.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttIf we would only get some rain. Everything is 
ttburned to cinders. We won't have anything to 
tteat this winter. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttt(yawning)
ttWe'll get by.

He says this smilingly, with a casual air. He stretches and laughs 
contentedly.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttI want Mikael to have a better life than ours. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttMikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or 
tta juggler who can do the one impossible trick. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttTo make one of the balls stand absolutely still
ttin the air. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttBut that's impossible.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttImpossible for us -- but not for him. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttYou're dreaming again.

She yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass.
JOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI've composed a song. I made it up during the 
ttnight when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to 
tthear it? 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttSing it. I'm very curious.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI have to sit up first.

He sits with his legs crossed, makes a dramatic gesture with his arms and 
sings in a loud voice. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttt(sings)
ttOn a lily branch a dove is perched 
ttAgainst the summer sky, 
ttShe sings a wondrous song of Christ 
ttAnd there's great joy on high.

He interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttMia! Are you asleep? 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttIt's a lovely song. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI haven't finished yet.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttI heard it, but I think I'll sleep a little 
ttlonger. You can sing the rest to me afterwards. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttAll you do is sleep.

JOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also 
sleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He 
yawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely 
made death mask.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttIs this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If 
ttthe priests didn't pay us so well, I'd say no 
ttthank you. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttAre you going to play Death?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttJust think, scaring decent folk out of their 
ttwits with this kind of nonsense.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttWhen are we supposed to do this play?

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttAt the saints' feast in Elsinore. We're going 
ttto perform right on the church steps, believe 
ttit or not.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttWouldn't it be better to play something bawdy? 
ttPeople like it better, and, besides, it's more 
ttfun.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttIdiot. There's a rumor going around that 
ttthere's a terrible pestilence in the land, and 
ttnow the priests are prophesying sudden death 
ttand all sorts of spiritual agonies. 

MIA is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of 
grass and looking smilingly at her husband.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttAnd what part am I to play?

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttYou're such a damn fool, so you're going to be 
ttthe Soul of Man.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttThat's a bad part, of course.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttWho makes the decisions around here? Who is the
ttdirector of this company anyhow?

SKAT, grinning, holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttBear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs by 
tta thread. Your time is short. 
ttt(in his usual voice) 
ttAre the women going to like me in this getup? 
ttWill I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead 
ttalready.

He stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously. JOF sits, leaning forward. 
MIA lies beside him on the grass. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttJof!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttWhat is it?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttSit still. Don't move. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttWhat do you mean? 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttDon't say anything. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI'm as silent as a grave. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttShh! I love you.
<b> 
</b>

Waves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist. The 
KNIGHT dismounts and enters. After tying up the horses, JONS slowly follows 
him in. When he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise. To the 
right of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite 
finished. Perched on a crude scaffolding is a PAINTER wearing a red cap and 
paint-stained clothes. He has one brush in his mouth, while with another in 
his hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other 
faces.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWhat is this supposed to represent? 

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttThe Dance of Death. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttAnd that one is Death?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttYes, he dances off with all of them.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWhy do you paint such nonsense?

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttI thought it would serve to remind people that 
ttthey must die.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWell, it's not going to make them feel any 
tthappier. 

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttWhy should one always make people happy? It 
ttmight not be a bad idea to scare them a little 
ttonce in a while.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttThen they'll close their eyes and refuse to 
ttlook at your painting.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttOh, they'll look. A skull is almost more 
ttinteresting than a naked woman.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttIf you do scare them ... 

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttThey'll think. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttAnd if they think ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttThey'll become still more scared.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttAnd then they'll run right into the arms of the 
ttpriests. 

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttThat's not my business.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYou're only painting your Dance of Death. 

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttI'm only painting things as they are. Everyone 
ttelse can do as he likes.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttJust think how some people will curse you. 

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttMaybe. But then I'll paint something amusing 
ttfor them to look at. I have to make a living 
tt-- at least until the plague takes me.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttThe plague. That sounds horrible.

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttYou should see the boils on a diseased man's 
ttthroat. You should see how his body shrivels up 
ttso that his legs look like knotted strings -- 
ttlike the man I've painted over there.

The PAINTER points with his brush. JONS sees a small human form writhing in 
the grass, its eyes turned upwards in a frenzied look of horror and pain. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttThat looks terrible.

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttIt certainly does. He tries to rip out the 
ttboil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open 
ttwith his fingernails and his screams can be 
ttheard everywhere. Does that scare you?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttScare? Me? You don't know me. What are the 
tthorrors you've painted over there?

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttThe remarkable thing is that the poor creatures
ttthink the pestilence is the Lord's punishment. 
ttMobs of people who call themselves Slaves of 
ttSin are swarming over the country, flagellating 
ttthemselves and others, all for the glory of God.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttDo they really whip themselves?

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttYes, it's a terrible sight. I crawl into a 
ttditch and hide when they pass by.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttDo you have any brandy? I've been drinking 
ttwater all day and it's made me as thirsty as a 
ttcamel in the desert. 

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttI think I frightened you after all.

JONS sits down with the PAINTER, who produces a jug of brandy.



The KNIGHT is kneeling before a small altar. It is dark and quiet around him.
The air is cool and musty. Pictures of saints look down on him with stony 
eyes. Christ's face is turned upwards, His mouth open as if in a cry of 
anguish. On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil 
spying on a miserable human being. The KNIGHT hears a sound from the 
confession booth and approaches it. The face of DEATH appears behind the 
grille for an instant, but the KNIGHT doesn't see him. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI want to talk to you as openly as I can, but 
ttmy heart is empty.

DEATH doesn't answer.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThe emptiness is a mirror turned towards my 
ttown face. I see myself in it, and I am filled 
ttwith fear and disgust. 

DEATH doesn't answer.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThrough my indifference to my fellow men, I 
tthave isolated myself from their company. Now I 
ttlive in a world of phantoms. I am imprisoned in 
ttmy dreams and fantasies. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttAnd yet you don't want to die. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYes, I do.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttWhat are you waiting for? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI want knowledge. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttYou want guarantees?

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttCall it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly 
ttinconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why 
ttshould He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken 
ttpromises and unseen miracles? 

DEATH doesn't answer.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttHow can we have faith in those who believe when 
ttwe can't have faith in ourselves? What is going 
ttto happen to those of us who want to believe 
ttbut aren't able to? And what is to become of 
ttthose who neither want to nor are capable of 
ttbelieving?

The KNIGHT stops and waits for a reply, but no one speaks or answers him. 
There is complete silence. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWhy can't I kill God within me? Why does He 
ttlive on in this painful and humiliating way 
tteven though I curse Him and want to tear Him 
ttout of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, 
ttis He a baffling reality that I can't shake 
ttoff? Do you hear me? 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttYes, I hear you.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI want knowledge, not faith, not suppositions, 
ttbut knowledge. I want God to stretch out His 
tthand towards me, reveal Himself and speak to 
ttme. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttBut He remains silent.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT
</b>ttI call out to Him in the dark but no one seems 
ttto be there.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttPerhaps no one is there.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThen life is an outrageous horror. No one can 
ttlive in the face of death, knowing that all is 
ttnothingness. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttMost people never reflect about either death or 
ttthe futility of life.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttBut one day they will have to stand at that 
ttlast moment of life and look towards the 
ttdarkness. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttWhen that day comes ...
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttIn our fear, we make an image, and that image 
ttwe call God.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttYou are worrying ...

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttDeath visited me this morning. We are playing 
ttchess together. This reprieve gives me the 
ttchance to arrange an urgent matter.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttWhat matter is that?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttMy life has been a futile pursuit, a wandering, 
tta great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no 
ttbitterness or self-reproach because the lives 
ttof most people are very much like this. But I 
ttwill use my reprieve for one meaningful deed. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttIs that why you are playing chess with Death? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttHe is a clever opponent, but up to now I 
tthaven't lost a single man.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttHow will you outwit Death in your game? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI use a combination of the bishop and the 
ttknight which he hasn't yet discovered. In the 
ttnext move I'll shatter one of his flanks.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttI'll remember that.

DEATH shows his face at the grill of the confession booth for a moment but 
disappears instantly.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYou've tricked and cheated me! But we'll meet 
ttagain, and I'll find a way.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttt(invisible)
ttWe'll meet at the inn, and there we'll continue 
ttplaying.

The KNIGHT raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes 
through the tiny window. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThis is my hand. I can move it, feel the blood 
ttpulsing through it. The sun is still high in 
ttthe sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing 
ttchess with Death. 

He makes a fist of his hand and lifts it to his temple.



Meanwhile, JONS and the PAINTER have got drunk and are talking animatedly 
together.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttMe and my master have been abroad and have just 
ttcome home. Do you understand, you little 
ttpictor? 

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttThe Crusade.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttt(drunk)
ttPrecisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy 
ttLand and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, 
ttwild animals eat us, heathens butcher us, the 
ttwine poison us, the women give us lice, the 
ttlice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the 
ttGlory of God. Our crusade was such madness that 
ttonly a real idealist could have thought it up. 
ttBut what you said about the plague was 
tthorrible. 

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttIt's worse than that.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttAh, me. No matter which way you turn, you have 
ttyour rump behind you. That's the truth.

<b>ttttPAINTER 
</b>ttThe rump behind you, the rump behind you 
ttthere's a profound truth.

JONS paints a small figure which is supposed to represent himself.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttThis is squire Jx88ns. He grins at Death, mocks 
ttthe Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the 
ttgirls. His world is a Jx88nsworld, believable 
ttonly to himself, ridiculous to all including 
tthimself, meaningless to Heaven and of no 
ttinterest to Hell. 

The KNIGHT walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright 
sunshine. JONS manages to set himself down from the scaffolding.

Outside the church, four soldiers and a monk are in the process of putting a 
woman in the stocks. Her face is pale and child-like, her head has been 
shaved, and her knuckles are bloody and broken. Her eyes are wide open, yet 
she doesn't appear to be fully conscious. 

JONS and the KNIGHT stop and watch in silence. The soldiers are working 
quickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected. The monk 
mumbles from a small book. One of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and 
with his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and 
around the woman. JONS holds his nose.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttThat soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What 
ttis it good for?

<b>ttttSOLDIER 
</b>ttShe has had carnal intercourse with the Evil 
ttOne. 

He whispers this with a horrified face and continues to splash the sticky 
mess on the wall. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttAnd now she's in the stocks.

<b>ttttSOLDIER 
</b>ttShe will be burned tomorrow morning at the 
ttparish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil 
ttaway from the rest of us.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttt(holding his nose)
ttAnd you do that with this stinking mess?

<b>ttttSOLDIER 
</b>ttIt's the best remedy: blood mixed with the bile 
ttof a big black dog. The Devil can't stand the 
ttsmell. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttNeither can I.
<b> 
</b>JONS walks over towards the horses. The KNIGHT stands for a few, moments 
looking at the young girl. She is almost a child. Slowly she turns her eyes 
towards him. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttHave you seen the Devil?

The MONK stops reading and raises his head. 

<b>ttttMONK 
</b>ttYou must not talk to her. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttCan that be so dangerous?

<b>ttttMONK 
</b>ttI don't know, but she is believed to have 
ttcaused the pestilence with which we are 
ttaffected. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI understand.

He nods resignedly and walks away. The young woman starts to moan as though 
she were having a horrible nightmare. The sound of her cries follows the two 
riders for a considerable distance down the road.
<b> 
</b>

The sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire. The waterskin is 
empty and JONS looks for a well where he can fill it.

They approach a group of peasant cottages at the edge of the forest. JONS 
ties up the horses, slings the skin over his shoulder and walks along the 
path towards the nearest cottage. As always, his movements are light and 
almost soundless. The door to the cottage is open. He stops outside, but when 
no one appears he enters. It is very dark inside and his foot touches a soft 
object. He looks down. Beside the whitewashed fireplace, a woman is lying 
with her face to the ground.

At the sound of approaching steps, JONS quickly hides behind the door. A man 
comes down a ladder from the loft. He is broad and thick-set. His eyes are 
black and his face is pale and puffy. His clothes are well cut but dirty and 
in rags. He carries a cloth sack. Looking around, he goes into the inner 
room, bends over the bed, tucks something into the bag, slinks along the 
walls, looking on the shelves, finds something else which he tucks in his 
bag.

Slowly he re-enters the outer room, bends over the dead woman and carefully 
slips a ring from her finger. At that moment a young woman comes through the 
door. She stops and stares at the stranger.

<b>ttttRAVEL 
</b>ttWhy do you look so surprised? I steal from the 
ttdead. These days it's quite a lucrative 
ttenterprise. 

The GIRL makes a movement as if to run away. 

<b>ttttRAVEL 
</b>ttYou're thinking of running to the village and 
tttelling. That wouldn't serve any purpose. Each 
ttof us has to save his own skin. It's as simple 
ttas that. 

<b>ttttGIRL 
</b>ttDon't touch me.

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttDon't try to scream. There's no one around to 
tthear you, neither God nor man.

Slowly he closes the door behind the GIRL. The stuffy room is now in almost 
total darkness. But JONS becomes clearly visible.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttI recognize you, although it's a long time 
ttsince we met. Your name is Raval, from the 
tttheological college at Roskilde. You are Dr. 
ttMirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis. 

RAVAL smiles uneasily and looks around. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttAm I not right?

The GIRL stands immobile.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYou were the one who, ten years ago, convinced 
ttmy master of the necessity to join a better-
ttclass crusade to the Holy Land.

RAVAL looks around.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYou look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-
ttache? 

RAVAL smiles anxiously.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWhen I see you, I suddenly understand the 
ttmeaning of these ten years, which previously 
ttseemed to me such a waste. Our life was too 
ttgood and we were too satisfied with ourselves. 
ttThe Lord wanted to punish us for our 
ttcomplacency. That is why He sent you to spew 
ttout your holy venom and poison the knight.

<b>ttttRAVEL 
</b>ttI acted in good faith.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttBut now you know better, don't you? Because 
ttnow you have turned into a thief. A more 
ttfitting and rewarding occupation for 
ttscoundrels. Isn't that so?

With a quick movement he knocks the knife out of RAVAL'S hand, gives him a 
kick so that he falls on the floor and is about to finish him off. Suddenly 
the GIRL screams. JONS stops and makes a gesture of generosity with his hand.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttBy all means. I'm not bloodthirsty. 

He bends over RAVAL. 

<b>ttttRAVEL 
</b>ttDon't beat me.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttI don't have the heart to touch you, Doctor. 
ttBut remember this: the next time we meet, I'll 
ttbrand your face the way one does with thieves. 
ttt(he rises)
ttWhat I really came for is to get my waterskin 
ttfilled.

<b>ttttGIRL 
</b>ttWe have a deep well with cool, fresh water. 
ttCome, I'll show you.

They walk out of the house. RAVAL lies still for a few moments, then he rises 
slowly and looks around. When no one is in sight, he takes his bag and steals 
away. JONS quenches his thirst and fills his bag with water. The GIRL helps 
him.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttJx88ns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative 
ttyoung man who has never had anything but kind 
ttthoughts and has only done beautiful and noble 
ttdeeds. I'm kindest of all to young women. With 
ttthem, there is no limit to my kindness. 

He embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back. Almost 
immediately he loses interest, hoists the waterbag on his shoulder and pats 
the GIRL on the cheek.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttGoodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped 
ttyou, but between you and me, I'm tired of that 
ttkind of love. It runs a little dry in the end.

He laughs kindly and walks away from her. When he has walked a short distance 
he turns; the GIRL is still there.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttNow that I think of it, I will need a 
tthousekeeper. Can you prepare good food? 
ttt(the GIRL nods)
ttAs far as I know, I'm still a married man, but
ttI have high hopes that my wife is dead by now.
ttThat's why I need a housekeeper. 
ttt(the GIRL doesn't 
tttanswer but gets up)
ttThe devil with it! Come along and don't stand 
ttthere staring. I've saved your life, so you owe 
ttme a great deal.

She begins walking towards him, her head bent. He doesn't wait for her but 
walks towards the KNIGHT, who patiently awaits his squire.
<b> 
</b>

The Embarrassment Inn lies in the eastern section of the province. The plague 
has not yet reached this area on its way along the coast.

The actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn. 
Dressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce.

The spectators watch the performance, commenting on it noisily. There are
merchants with fat, beer-sweaty faces, apprentices and journeymen, farmhands 
and milkmaids. A whole flock of children perch in the trees around the wagon.
<b> 
</b>The KNIGHT and his squire have sat down in the shadow of a wall. They drink 
beer and doze in the midday heat. The GIRL from the deserted village sleeps 
at JONS'S side. SKAT beats the drums, JOF blows the flute, MIA performs a gay 
and lively dance. They perspire under the hot white sun. When they have 
finished SKAT comes forward and bows.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttNoble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for 
ttyour interest. Please remain standing for a
ttlittle longer, or sit on the ground, because 
ttwe are now going to perform a tragedia about 
ttan unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and 
ttthe handsome lover -- that's me.

MIA and JOF have quickly changed costumes and again step out on the stage. 
They bow, to the public. 

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttHere is the husband. Here is the wife. If 
ttyou'll shut up over there, you'll see something 
ttsplendid. As I said, I play the lover and I 
tthaven't entered yet. That's why I'm going to 
tthide behind the curtain for the time being. 
ttt(he wipes the sweat 
tttfrom his forehead)
ttIt's damned hot. I think we'll have a 
ttthunderstorm.

He places his leg in front of JOF as if to trip him, raises MIA's skirt, 
makes a face as if he could see all the wonders of the world underneath it, 
and disappears behind the gaudily patched curtains.

SKAT is very handsome, now that he can see himself in the reflection of a tin 
washbowl. His hair is tightly curled, his eyebrows are beautifully bushy, 
glittering earrings vie for equal attention with his teeth, and his cheeks 
are flushed rose red.
<b> 
</b>He sits out in back on the tailboard of the wagon, dangling his legs and 
whistling to himself.
<b> 
</b>In the meantime JOF and MIA play their tragedy; it is not, however, received 
with great acclaim. SKAT suddenly discovers that someone is watching him as 
he gazes contentedly into the tin bowl. A woman stands there, stately in both 
height and volume.
<b> 
</b>SKAT frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but 
fiery glance at the beautiful visitor. She suddenly discovers that one of her 
shoes doesn't quite fit. She leans down to fix it and in doing so allows her 
generous bosom to burst out of its prison -- no more than honor and chastity 
allow, but still enough so that the actor with his experienced eye 
immediately sees that there are ample rewards to be had here.

Now she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing 
several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine. JONAS SKAT manages 
not to fall off the wagon in his excitement. Standing on the steps of the 
wagon, he supports himself against a nearby tree, crosses his legs and bows.
<b> 
</b>The woman quietly bites into a chicken leg dripping with fat. At this moment 
the actor is stricken by a radiant glance full of lustful appetites.

When he sees this look, SKAT makes an instantaneous decision, jumps down from 
the wagon and kneels in front of the blushing damsel.

She becomes weak and faint from his nearness, looks at him with a glassy 
glance and breathes heavily. SKAT doesn't neglect to press kisses on her 
small, chubby hands. The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in 
the bushes.

Now she is forced to sit back; her legs seem unwilling to support her any 
longer. Bewildered, she singles out another chicken leg from the large sack 
of food and holds it up in front of SKAT with an appealing and triumphant 
expression, as if it were her maidenhood being offered as a prize.

SKAT hesitates momentarily, but he is still the strategist. He lets the 
chicken leg fall to the grass, and murmurs in the woman's rosy ear.

His words seem to please her. She puts her arms around the actor's neck and 
pulls him to her with such fierceness that both of them lose their balance 
and tumble down on the soft grass. The small birds take to their wings with 
frightened shrieks.



JOF stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand. MIA pretends 
to be asleep on a bench which has been pulled forward on the stage. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttNight and moonlight now prevail 
ttHere sleeps my wife so frail ... 

<b>ttttVOICE FROM THE PUBLIC
</b>ttDoes she snore?

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttMay I point out that this is a tragedy, and in 
tttragedies one doesn't snore.

<b>ttttVOICE FROM THE PUBLIC
</b>ttI think she should snore anyhow. 

This opinion causes mirth in the audience. JOF becomes slightly confused and 
goes out of character, but MIA keeps her head and begins snoring. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttNight and moonlight now prevail.
ttThere snores -- I mean sleeps -- my wife so frail. 
ttJealous I am, as never before, 
ttI hide myself behind this door. 
ttFaithful is she 
ttTo her lover -- not me. 
ttHe soon comes a-stealing 
ttTo awaken her lusty feeling. 
ttI shall now kill him dead 
ttFor cuckolding me in my bed. 
ttThere he comes in the moonlight, 
ttHis white legs shining bright. 
ttQuiet as a mouse, here I'll lie, 
ttTell him not that he's about to die.

JOF hides himself. MIA immediately ends her snoring and sits up, looking to 
the left. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttLook, there he comes in the night 
ttMy lover, my heart's delight.

She becomes silent and looks wide-eyed in front of her. The mood in the yard 
in front of the inn has, up to now, been rather lighthearted despite the 
heat.
<b> 
</b>Now a rapid change occurs. People who had been laughing and chattering fall 
silent. Their faces seem to pale under their sunbrowned skins, the children 
stop their games and stand with gaping mouths and frightened eyes.
<b> 
</b>JOF steps out in front of the curtain. His painted face bears an expression 
of horror. MIA has risen with MIKAEL in her arms. Some of the women in the 
yard have fallen on their knees, others hide their faces, many begin to 
mutter half-forgotten prayers.

All have turned their faces towards the white road. Now a shrill song is 
heard. It is frenzied, almost a scream. A crucified Christ sways above the 
hilltop.

The cross-bearers soon come into sight. They are Dominican monks, their hoods 
pulled down over their faces. More and more of them follow, carrying litters 
with heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out 
spasmodically. The dust wells up around their black hoods; the censers sway 
and emit a thick, ashen smoke which smells of rancid herbs.

After the line of monks comes another procession. It is a column of men, 
boys, old men, women, girls, children. All of them have steel-edged scourges 
in their hands with which they whip themselves and each other, howling 
ecstatically. They twist in pain; their eyes bulge wildly; their lips are 
gnawed to shreds and dripping with foam. They have been seized by madness. 
They bite their own hands and arms, whip each other in violent, almost 
rhythmic outbursts. Throughout it all the shrill song howls from their 
bursting throats. Many sway and fall, lift themselves up again, support each
other and help each other to intensify the scourging.

Now the procession pauses at the crossroads in front of the inn. The monks 
fall on their knees, hiding their faces with clenched hands, arms pressed 
tightly together. Their song never stops. The Christ figure on its timbered 
cross is raised above the heads of the crowd. It is not Christ triumphant, 
but the suffering Jesus with the sores, the blood, the hammered nails and the 
face in convulsive pain. The Son of God, nailed on the wood of the cross, 
suffering scorn and shame.
<b> 
</b>The penitents have now sunk down in the dirt of the road. They collapse where 
they stood like slaughtered cattle. Their screams rise with the song of the 
monks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun.
<b> 
</b>A large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red-
brown from the sun. His eyes glitter; his voice is thick with impotent scorn.

<b>ttttMONK
</b>ttGod has sentenced us to punishment. We shall 
ttall perish in the black death. You, standing 
ttthere like gaping cattle, you who sit there in 
ttyour glutted complacency, do you know that this 
ttmay be your last hour? Death stands right 
ttbehind you. I can see how his crown gleams in 
ttthe sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it 
ttabove your heads. Which one of you shall he 
ttstrike first? You there, who stand staring like 
tta goat, will your mouth be twisted into the 
ttlast unfinished gasp before nightfall? And you, 
ttwoman, who bloom with life and self-
ttsatisfaction, will you pale and become 
ttextinguished before the morning dawns? You back
ttthere, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, 
ttdo you have another year left to dirty the 
ttearth with your refuse? Do you know, you 
ttinsensible fools, that you shall die today or 
tttomorrow, or the next day, because all of you 
tthave been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do 
ttyou hear the word? You have been sentenced, 
ttsentenced! 

The MONK falls silent, looking around with a bitter face and a cold, scornful
glance. Now, he clenches his hands, straddles the ground and turns his face
upwards. 

<b>ttttMONK
</b>ttLord have mercy on us in our humiliation! Don't 
ttturn your face from us in loathing and 
ttcontempt, but be merciful to us for the sake of 
ttyour son, Jesus Christ. 

He makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a
strong voice. The monks rise and join in the song. As if driven by some 
superhuman force, the penitents begin to whip themselves again, still wailing 
and moaning.

The procession continues. New members have joined the rear of the column; 
others who were unable to go on lie weeping in the dust of the road. JONS the 
squire drinks his beer.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttThis damned ranting about doom. Is that food 
ttfor the minds of modern people? Do they really 
ttexpect us to take them seriously?

The KNIGHT grins tiredly.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me 
ttto point out that I've either read, heard or 
ttexperienced most of the tales which we people 
tttell each other. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttt(yawns) 
ttYes, yes.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttEven the ghost stories about God the Father, 
ttthe angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost --
ttall these I've accepted without too much 
ttemotion.

He leans down over the GIRL as she crouches at his feet and pats her on the 
head. The KNIGHT drinks his beer silently.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttt(contentedly)
ttMy little stomach is my world, my head is my 
tteternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My 
ttlegs are time's damned pendulums, and my dirty 
ttfeet are two splendid starting points for my 
ttphilosophy. Everything is worth precisely as 
ttmuch as a belch, the only difference being that 
tta belch is more satisfying.

The beer mug is empty. Sighing, JONS gets to his feet. The GIRL follows him 
like a shadow.

In the yard he meets a large man with a sooty face and a dark expression. He 
stops JONS with a roar. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWhat are you screaming about?

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttI am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire 
ttJx88ns. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttThat's possible.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttHave you seen my wife?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttNo, I haven't. But if I had seen her and she 
ttlooked like you, I'd quickly forget that I'd 
ttseen her. 

<b>ttttPLOG
</b>ttWell, in that case you haven't seen her. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttMaybe she's run off. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttDo you know anything?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttI know quite a lot, but not about your wife. Go 
ttto the inn. Maybe they can help you.

The smith sighs sadly and goes inside.

The inn is very small and full of people eating and drinking to forget their 
newly aroused fears of eternity. In the open fireplace a roasting pig turns
on an iron spit. The sun shines outside the casement window, its sharp rays
piercing the darkness of the room, which is thick with fumes and
perspiration.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMERCHANT
</b>ttYes, it's true! The plague is spreading along 
ttthe west coast. People are dying like flies. 
ttUsually business would be good at this time of 
ttyear, but, damn it, I've still got my whole 
ttstock unsold.

<b>ttttWOMAN 
</b>ttThey speak of the judgment day. And all these 
ttomens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands 
ttand other monstrosities began pouring out of 
ttan old woman, and down in the village another 
ttwoman gave birth to a calf's head. 

<b>ttttOLD MAN 
</b>ttThe day of judgment. Imagine.

<b>ttttFARMER
</b>ttIt hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely 
ttlose our crops.

<b>ttttMERCHANT
</b>ttAnd people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee 
ttthe country and carry the plague with them 
ttwherever they go. 

<b>ttttOLD MAN 
</b>ttThe day of judgment. Just think, just think! 

<b>ttttFARMER 
</b>ttIf it's as they say, I suppose a person should 
ttlook after his house and try to enjoy life as 
ttlong as he can. 

<b>ttttWOMAN 
</b>ttBut there have been other things too, such 
ttthings that can't even be spoken of. 
ttt(whispers)
ttThings that mustn't be named -- but the priests 
ttsay that the woman carries it between her legs 
ttand that's why she must cleanse herself. 

<b>ttttOLD MAN 
</b>ttJudgment day. And the Riders of the Apocalypse 
ttstand at the bend in the village road. I 
ttimagine they'll come on judgment night, at 
ttsundown.

<b>ttttWOMAN 
</b>ttThere are many who have purged themselves with
t tfire and died from it, but the priests say that 
ttit's better to die pure than to live for hell.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMERCHANT 
</b>ttThis is the end, yes, it is. No one says it out
ttloud, but all of us know that it's the end. And 
ttpeople are going mad from fear.

<b>ttttFARMER
</b>ttSo you're afraid too. 

<b>ttttMERCHANT
</b>ttOf course I'm afraid.

<b>ttttOLD MAN 
</b>ttThe judgment day becomes night, and the angels 
ttdescend and the graves open. It will be 
ttterrible to see. 

They whisper in low tones and sit close to each other.



PLOG, the smith, shoves his way into a place next to JOF, who is still 
dressed in his costume. Opposite him sits RAVAL, leaning slightly forward, 
his face perspiring heavily. RAVAL rolls an armlet out on the table. 

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttDo you want this armlet? You can have it 
ttcheap. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI can't afford it. 

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttIt's real silver.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttIt's nice. But it's surely too expensive for 
ttme. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttExcuse me, but has anyone here seen my wife? 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttHas she disappeared? 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttThey say she's run away. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttHas she deserted you? 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttWith an actor.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttAn actor! If she's got such bad taste, then I 
ttthink you should let her go.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttYou're right. My first thought, of course, was 
ttto kill her.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttOh. But to murder her, that's a terrible thing 
ttto do. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttI'm also going to kill the actor. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttThe actor?

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttOf course, the one she eloped with. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttWhat has he done to deserve that? 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttAre you stupid?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttThe actor! Now I understand. There are too many 
ttof them, so even if he hasn't done anything in 
ttparticular you ought to kill him merely because 
tthe's an actor. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttYou see, my wife has always been interested in 
ttthe tricks of the theatre.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttAnd that turned out to be her misfortune. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttHer misfortune, but not mine, because a person 
ttwho's born unfortunate can hardly suffer from 
ttany further misfortune. Isn't that true?

Now RAVAL enters the discussion. He is slightly drunk and his voice is shrill 
and evil.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttListen, you! You sit there and lie to the 
ttsmith. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI! A liar!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttYou're an actor too and it's probably your 
ttpartner who's run off with Plog's old lady. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttAre you an actor too?

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttAn actor! Me! I wouldn't quite call myself that! 

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttWe ought to kill you; it's only logical. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttt(laughs)
ttYou're really funny.

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttHow strange -- you've turned pale. Have you 
ttanything on your conscience?

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttYou're funny. Don't you think he's funny? 
ttt(to Plog)
ttOh, you don't.

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttMaybe we should mark you up a little with a 
ttknife, like they do petty scoundrels of your 
ttkind.

PLOG bangs his hands down on the table so that the dishes jump. He gets up.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttt(shouting)
ttWhat have you done with my wife? 

The room becomes silent. JOF looks around, but there is no exit, no way to 
escape. He puts his hands on the table. Suddenly a knife flashes through the 
air and sinks into the table top between his fingers.

JOF snatches away his hands and raises his head. He looks half surprised, as 
if the truth had just become apparent to him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttDo you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked 
ttsomeone, or got in the way? I'll leave right 
ttnow and never come back.

JOF looks from one face to another, but no one seems ready to help him or 
come to his defense.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttGet up so everyone can hear you. Talk louder. 

Trembling, JOF rises. He opens his mouth as if to say something, but not a 
word comes out.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttStand on your head so that we can see how good 
ttan actor you are.

JOF gets up on the table and stands on his head. A hand pushes him forward so
that he collapses on the floor. PLOG rises, pulls him to his feet with one 
hand. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttt(shouts) 
ttWhat have you done with my wife? 

PLOG beats him so furiously that JOF flies across the table. RAVAL leans over
him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttDon't lie there moaning. Get up and dance. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI don't want to. I can't.

<b>ttttRAVEL 
</b>ttShow us how you imitate a bear. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI can't play a bear.

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttLet's see if you can't after all.

RAVAL prods JOF lightly with the knife point. JOF gets up with cold sweat on 
his cheeks and forehead, frightened half to death. He begins to jump and hop 
on top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces.
Some laugh, but most of the people sit silently. JOF gasps as if his lungs 
were about to burst. He sinks to his knees, and someone pours beer over him. 

<b>ttttRAVEL 
</b>ttUp again! Be a good bear.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI haven't done any harm. I haven't got the 
ttstrength to play a bear any more.

At that moment the door opens and JONS enters. JOF sees his chance and steals
out. RAVAL intends to follow him, but suddenly stops. JONS and RAVAL look at 
each other. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttDo you remember what I was going to do to you 
ttif we met again?

RAVAL steps back without speaking. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttI'm a man who keeps his word.

JONS raises his knife and cuts RAVAL from forehead to cheek. RAVAL staggers 
towards the wall.
<b> 
</b>

The hot day has become night. Singing and howling can be heard from the inn. 
In a hollow near the forest, the light still lingers. Hidden in the grass and
the shrubbery, nightingales sing and their voices echo through the stillness.
<b> 
</b>The players' wagon stands in a small ravine, and not far away the horse 
grazes on the dry grass. MIA has sat down in front of the wagon with her son 
in her arms. They play together and laugh happily.

Now, a soft gleam of light strokes the hilltops, a last reflection from the 
red clouds over the sea.

Not far from the wagon, the KNIGHT sits crouched over his chess game. He 
lifts his head.

The evening light moves across the heavy wagon wheels, across the woman and 
the child. The KNIGHT gets up.

MIA sees him and smiles. She holds up her struggling son, as if to amuse the 
<b>KNIGHT. 
</b>
<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWhat's his name? 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttMikael.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttHow old is he? 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttOh, he'll soon be two. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttHe's big for his age.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttDo you think so? Yes, I guess he's rather big. 

She puts the child down on the ground and half rises to shake out her red 
skirt. When she sits down again, the KNIGHT steps closer.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYou played some kind of show this afternoon. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttDid you think it was bad?

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYou are more beautiful now without your face 
ttpainted, and this gown is more becoming.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttYou see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, 
ttso we're in real trouble now.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttIs that your husband?

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttt(laughs)
ttJonas! The other man is my husband. His name is 
ttJof.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttOh, that one.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttAnd now there's only him and me. We'll have to 
ttstart doing tricks again and that's more 
tttrouble than it's worth. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttDo you do tricks also?

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttWe certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful 
ttjuggler.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttIs Mikael going to be an acrobat? 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttJof wants him to be. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttBut you don't.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttI don't know.
ttt(smiling)
ttPerhaps he'll become a knight. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttLet me assure you, that's no pleasure either. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttNo, you don't look so happy. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttAre you tired? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYes. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttWhy?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI have dull company. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttDo you mean your squire? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttNo, not him.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttWho do you mean, then? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttMyself. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttI understand. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttDo you, really?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttYes, I understand rather well. I have often 
ttwondered why people torture themselves as often 
ttas they can. Isn't that so?

She nods energetically and the KNIGHT smiles seriously. Now the shrieks and 
the noise from the inn become louder. Black figures flicker across the grass 
mound. Someone collapses, gets up and runs. It is JOF. MIA stretches out her 
arms and receives him. He holds his hands in front of his face, moaning like 
a child, and his body sways. He kneels. MIA holds him close to her and 
sprinkles him with small, anxious questions: What have you done? How are you?
What is it? Does it hurt? What can I do? Have they been cruel to you? She 
runs for a rag, which she dips in water, and carefully bathes her husband's
dirty, bloody face.
<b> 
</b>Eventually a rather sorrowful visage emerges. Blood runs from a bruise on his 
forehead and his nose, and a tooth has been loosened, but otherwise JOF seems 
unhurt. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttOuch, it hurts.

<b>ttttMIA
</b>ttWhy did you have to go there? And of course you 
ttdrank.

MIA's anxiety has been replaced by a mild anger. She pats him a little harder 
than necessary. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttOuch! I didn't drink anything.

<b>ttttMIA
</b>ttThen I suppose you were boasting about the 
ttangels and devils you consort with. People 
ttdon't like someone who has too many ideas and 
ttfantasies.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI swear to you that I didn't say a word about 
ttangels. 

<b>ttttMIA
</b>ttYou were, of course, busy singing and dancing. 
ttYou can never stop being an actor. People also 
ttbecome angry at that, and you know it.

JOF doesn't answer but searches for the armlet. He holds it up in front of 
MIA with an injured expression. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttLook what I bought for you. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttYou couldn't afford it. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttt(angry)
ttBut I got it anyhow.

The armlet glitters faintly in the twilight. MIA now pulls it across her 
wrist. They look at it in silence, and their faces soften. They look at each 
other, touch each other's hands. JOF puts his head against MIA'S shoulder and 
sighs.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttOh, how they beat me.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttWhy didn't you beat them back?

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI only become frightened and angry. I never get 
tta chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know 
ttthat. I roared like a lion.

<b>ttttMIA
</b>ttWere they frightened? 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttNo, they just laughed.

Their son MIKAEL crawls over to them. JOF lies down on the ground and pulls 
his son on top of him. MIA gets down on her hands and knees and playfully 
sniffs at MIKAEL.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttDo you notice how good he smells?

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttAnd he is so compact to hold. You're a sturdy 
ttone. A real acrobat's body.

He lifts MIKAEL up and holds him by the legs. MIA looks up suddenly, 
remembering the knight's presence. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttYes, this is my husband, Jof. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttGood evening. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttGood evening.
<b> 
</b>JOF becomes a little embarrassed and rises. All three of them look at one 
another silently.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI have just told your wife that you have a 
ttsplendid son. He'll bring great joy to you. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttYes, he's fine.
<b>     
</b>They become silent again.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttHave we nothing to offer the knight, Mia? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThank you, I don't want anything.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttt(housewifely)
ttI picked a basket of wild strawberries this 
ttafternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh 
ttfrom a cow ... 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>tt... that we were allowed to milk. So, if you 
ttwould like to partake of this humble fare, it 
ttwould be a great honor. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttPlease be seated and I'll bring the food. 

They sit down. MIA disappears with MIKAEL. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWhere are you going next? 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttUp to the saints' feast at Elsinore. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI wouldn't advise you to go there. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttWhy not, if I may ask?

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThe plague has spread in that direction, 
ttfollowing the coast line south. It's said that 
ttpeople are dying by the tens of thousands.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttReally! Well, sometimes life is a little hard. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttMay I suggest ... 
ttt(JOF looks at him, surprised)
 tt... that you follow me through the forest 
tttonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go 
ttalong the east coast. You'll probably be safer 
ttthere.

MIA has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it 
between them and gives each of them a spoon.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI wish you good appetite. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI humbly thank you.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttThese are wild strawberries from the forest. I 
tthave never seen such large ones. They grow up 
ttthere on the hillside. Notice how they smell!

She points with a spoon and smiles. The KNIGHT nods, as if he were pondering 
some profound thought. JOF eats heartily.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttYour suggestion is good, but I must think it 
ttover. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttIt might be wise to have company going through 
ttthe forest. It's said to be full of trolls and 
ttghosts and bandits. That's what I've heard.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttt(staunchly)
ttYes, I'd say that it's not a bad idea, but I 
tthave to think about it. Now that Skat has left, 
ttI am responsible for the troupe. After all, I 
tthave become director of the whole company.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttt(mimics) 
ttAfter all, I have become director of the whole 
ttcompany.

JONS comes walking slowly down the hill, closely followed by the GIRL. MIA 
points with her spoon. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttDo you want some strawberries?

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttThis man saved my life. Sit down, my friend, 
ttand let us be together.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttt(stretches herself) 
ttOh, how nice this is. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttFor a short while.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttNearly always. One day is like another. There 
ttis nothing strange about that. The summer, of 
ttcourse, is better than the winter, because in 
ttsummer you don't have to be cold. But spring is 
ttbest of all.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps 
ttyou'd like to hear it. I'll run and get my lyre. 

He sprints towards the wagon.
<b> 
</b><b> ttttMIA 
</b>ttNot now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by 
ttyour songs.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttt(politely) 
ttBy all means. I write little songs myself. For 
ttexample, I know a very funny song about a 
ttwanton fish which I doubt that you've heard yet. 

The KNIGHT looks at him.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYou'll not get to hear it either. There are 
ttpersons here who don't appreciate my art and I 
ttdon't want to upset anyone. I'm a sensitive 
ttsoul.

JOF has come out with his lyre, sits on a small, gaudy box and plucks at the 
instrument, humming quietly, searching for his melody. JONS yawns and lies 
down. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttPeople are troubled by so much.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttIt's always better when one is two. Have you no 
ttone of your own?

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYes, I think I had someone. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttAnd what is she doing now? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttYou look so solemn. Was she your beloved? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWe were newly married and we played together. 
ttWe laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her 
tteyes, to her nose, to her beautiful little 
ttears. We went hunting together and at night we 
ttdanced. The house was full of life ... 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttDo you want some more strawberries?

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttt(shakes his head)
ttFaith is a torment, did you know that? It is 
ttlike loving someone who is out there in the 
ttdarkness but never appears, no matter how 
ttloudly you call. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttI don't understand what you mean.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttEverything I've said seems meaningless and 
ttunreal while I sit here with you and your 
tthusband. How unimportant it all becomes 
ttsuddenly.

He takes the bowl of milk in his hand and drinks deeply from it several 
times. Then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttNow you don't look so solemn.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI shall remember this moment. The silence, the 
tttwilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk,
ttyour faces in the evening light. Mikael 
ttsleeping, Jof with his lyre. I'll try to 
ttremember what we have talked about. I'll carry 
ttthis memory between my hands as carefully as 
ttif it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh 
ttmilk. 

He turns his face away and looks out towards the sea and the colorless gray 
sky. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttAnd it will be an adequate sign -- it will be 
ttenough for me.

He rises, nods to the others and walks down towards the forest. JOF continues 
to play on his lyre. MIA stretches out on the grass.

The KNIGHT picks up his chess game and carries it towards the beach. It is 
quiet and deserted; the sea is still. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttI have been waiting for you.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttPardon me. I was detained for a few moments. 
ttBecause I revealed my tactics to you, I'm in 
ttretreat. It's your move.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttWhy do you look so satisfied? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThat's my secret.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttOf course. Now I take your knight. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYou did the right thing. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttHave you tricked me?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttOf course. You fell right in the trap. Check! 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttWhat are you laughing at?

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttDon't worry about my laughter; save your king 
ttinstead.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttYou're rather arrogant. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttOur game amuses me.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttIt's your move. Hurry up. I'm a little pressed 
ttfor time.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI understand that you've a lot to do, but you 
ttcan't get out of our game. It takes time.

DEATH is about to answer him but stops and leans over the board. The KNIGHT 
smiles.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttAre you going to escort the juggler and his 
ttwife through the forest? Those whose names are 
ttJof and Mia and who have a small son? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWhy do you ask? 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttOh, no reason at all.
<b> 
</b>The KNIGHT suddenly stops smiling. DEATH looks at him scornfully.
<b> 
</b>

Immediately after sundown, the little company gathers in the yard of the inn.
There is the KNIGHT, JONS and the GIRL, JOF and MIA in their wagon. Their 
son, MIKAEL, is already asleep. JONAS SKAT is still missing. 

JONS goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a 
last mug of beer. The inn is now empty and quiet except for a few farmhands 
and maidens who are eating their evening meal in a corner. At one of the 
small windows sits a lonely, hunched-over fellow, with a jug of brandy in his 
hands. His expression is very sad. Once in a while he is shaken by a gigantic 
sob. It is PLOG, the smith, who sits there and whimpers. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttGod in heaven, isn't this Plog, the smith? 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttGood evening.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttAre you sitting here sniveling in loneliness? 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttYes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a 
ttrabbit. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttIf I were in your boots, I'd be happy to get 
ttrid of a wife in such an easy way.

JONS pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down 
by his side. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttAre you married?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttI! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count 
ttof all my wives any longer. But it's often that 
ttway when you're a traveling man.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttI can assure you that one wife is worse than a 
tthundred, or else I've had worse luck than any 
ttpoor wretch in this miserable world, which 
ttisn't impossible.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYes, it's hell with women and hell without 
ttthem. So, however you look at it, it's still 
ttbest to kill them off while it's most amusing.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttWomen's nagging, the shrieking of children and 
ttwet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows 
ttand pokes, and the devil's aunt for a 
ttmother-in-law. And then, when one wants to 
ttsleep after a long day, there's a new song -- 
tttears, whining and moans loud enough to wake 
ttthe dead. 

JONS nods delightedly. He has drunk deeply and talks with an old woman's 
voice. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWhy don't you kiss me good night?

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttt(in the same way)
ttWhy don't you sing a song for me? 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWhy don't you love me the way you did when we 
ttfirst met?

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttWhy don't you look at my new slip? 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYou only turn your back and snore. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttOh hell!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttOh hell. And now she's gone. Rejoice!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttt(furious) 
ttI'll snip their noses with pliers, I'll bash in 
tttheir chests with a small hammer, I'll tap 
tttheir heads ever so lightly with a sledge.

PLOG begins to cry loudly and his whole body sways in an enormous attack of 
sorrow. JONS looks at him with interest.

<b>ttttJONS
</b>ttLook how he howls again. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttMaybe I love her.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttSo, maybe you love her! Then, you poor 
ttmisguided ham shank, I'll tell you that love is 
ttanother word for lust, plus lust, plus lust 
ttand a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and 
ttall kinds of other fooling around. 

<b>ttttPLOG
</b>ttYes, but it hurts anyway.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttOf course. Love is the blackest of all plagues, 
ttand if one could die of it, there would be 
ttsome pleasure in love. But you almost always 
ttget over it. 

<b>ttttPLOG
</b>ttNo, no, not me.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYes, you too. There are only a couple of poor 
ttwretches who die of love once in a while. Love 
ttis as contagious as a cold in the nose. It eats 
ttaway at your strength, your independence, your 
ttmorale, if you have any. If everything is 
ttimperfect in this imperfect world, love is most 
ttperfect in its perfect imperfection.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttYou're happy, you with your oily words, and, 
ttbesides, you believe your own drivel.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttBelieve! Who said that I believed it? But I 
ttlove to give good advice. If you ask me for 
ttadvice you'll get two pieces for the price of 
ttone, because after all I really am an educated 
ttman.

JONS gets up from the table and strokes his face with his hands. PLOG becomes 
very unhappy and grabs his belt. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttListen, Jx88ns. May I go with you through the 
ttforest? I'm so lonely and don't want to go home 
ttbecause everyone will laugh at me.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttOnly if you don't whimper all the time, because 
ttin that case we'll all have to avoid you.

PLOG gets up and embraces JONS. Slightly drunk, the two new friends walk 
towards the door.
<b> 
</b>When they come out in the yard, JOF immediately catches sight of them, 
becomes angry and yells a warning to JONS.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttJx88ns! Watch out. That one wants to fight all 
ttthe time. He's not quite sane.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYes, but now he's just sniveling.

PLOG steps up to JOF, who blanches with fear. PLOG offers his hand.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttI'm really sorry if I hurt you. But I have 
ttsuch a hell of a temper, you know. Shake hands.

JOF gingerly proffers a frightened hand and gets it thoroughly shaken and 
squeezed. While JOF tries to straighten out his fingers, PLOG is seized by 
great good will and opens his arms.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttCome in my arms, little brother.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttThank you, thank you, perhaps later. But now 
ttwe're really in a hurry.

JOF climbs up on the wagon seat quickly and clucks at the horse.
<b> 
</b>

The small company is on its way towards the forest and the night.

It is dark in the forest.
<b> 
</b>First comes the KNIGHT on his large horse. Then JOF and MIA follow, sitting 
close to each other in the juggler's wagon. MIA holds her son in her arms. 
JONS follows them with his heavily laden horse. He has the smith in tow. The 
GIRL sits on top of the load on the horse's back, hunched over as if asleep.

The footsteps, the horses' heavy tramp on the soft path, the human breathing 
-- yet it is quiet.
<b> 
</b>Then the moon sails out of the clouds. The forest suddenly becomes alive with 
the night's unreality. The dazzling light pours through the thick foliage of 
the beech trees, a moving, quivering world of light and shadow.

The wanderers stop. Their eyes are dark with anxiety and foreboding. Their 
faces are pale and unreal in the floating light. It is very quiet.

<b>ttttPLOG
</b>ttNow the moon has come out of the clouds. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttThat's good. Now we can see the road better. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttI don't like the moon tonight. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttThe trees stand so still.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttThat's because there's no wind. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttI guess he means that they stand very still. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttIt's completely quiet.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttIf one could hear a fox at least. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttOr an owl.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttOr a human voice besides one's own.

<b>ttttGIRL
</b>ttThey say it's dangerous to remain standing in 
ttmoonlight.

Suddenly, out of the silence and the dim light falling across the forest 
road, a ghostlike cart emerges. It is the WITCH being taken to the place 
where she will be burned. Next to her eight soldiers shuffle along tiredly, 
carrying their lances on their backs. The girl sits in the cart, bound with 
iron chains around her throat and arms. She stares fixedly into the 
moonlight.
<b> 
</b>A black figure sits next to her, a monk with his hood pulled down over his 
head. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWhere are you going? 

<b>ttttSOLDIER
</b>ttTo the place of execution.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYes, now I can see. It's the girl who has done 
ttit with the Black One. The witch?

The SOLDIER nods sourly. Hesitantly, the travelers follow. The KNIGHT guides 
his horse over to the side of the cart. The WITCH seems to be half-conscious, 
but her eyes are wide open.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI see that they have hurt your hands.

The WITCH'S pale, childish face turns towards the KNIGHT and she shakes her 
head. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI have a potion that will stop your pain.

She shakes her head again.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWhy do you burn her at this time of night? 
ttPeople have so few diversions these days.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSOLDIER 
</b>ttSaints preserve us, be quiet! It's said that 
ttshe brings the Devil with her wherever she 
ttgoes. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYou are eight brave men, then.

<b>ttttSOLDIER 
</b>ttWell, we've been paid. And this is a volunteer 
ttjob. 

The SOLDIER speaks in whispers while glancing anxiously at the WITCH.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttt(to the WITCH)
ttWhat's your name? 

<b>ttttTYAN
</b>ttMy name is Tyan, my lord. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttHow old are you? 

<b>ttttTYAN
</b>ttFourteen, my lord.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttAnd is it true that you have been in league 
ttwith the Devil?

TYAN nods quietly and looks away. Now they arrive at the parish border. At 
the foot of the nearby hills lies a crossroads. The pyre has already been 
stacked in the center of the forest clearing. The travelers remain there, 
hesitant and curious.
<b> 
</b>The soldiers have tied up the cart horse and bring out two long wooden beams.
They nail rungs across the beams so that it looks like a ladder. TYAN will be 
bound to this like an eelskin stretched out to dry.

The sound of the hammering echoes through the forest. The KNIGHT has 
dismounted and walks closer to the cart. Again he tries to catch TYAN'S eyes, 
touches her very lightly as if to waken her. Slowly she turns her face 
towards him.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThey say that you have been in league with the 
ttDevil.

<b>ttttTYAN
</b>ttWhy do you ask?

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttNot out of curiosity, but for very personal 
ttreasons. I too want to meet him. 

<b>ttttTYAN 
</b>ttWhy?

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI want to ask him about God. He, if anyone, 
ttmust know.

<b>ttttTYAN 
</b>ttYou can see him anytime. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttHow?

<b>ttttTYAN 
</b>ttYou must do as I tell you.

The KNIGHT grips the wooden rail of the cart so tightly that his knuckles 
whiten. TYAN leans forward and joins her gaze with his. 

<b>ttttTYAN 
</b>ttLook into my eyes.

The KNIGHT meets her gaze. They stare at each other for a long time.

<b>ttttTYAN 
</b>ttWhat do you see? Do you see him?

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI see fear in your eyes, an empty, numb fear. 
ttBut nothing else.

He falls silent. The soldiers work at the stakes; their hammering echoes in 
the forest. 

<b>ttttTYAN 
</b>ttNo one, nothing, no one? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttt(shakes his head)
ttNo.

<b>ttttTYAN
</b>ttCan't you see him behind your back? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttt(looks around) 
ttNo, there is no one there. 

<b>ttttTYAN 
</b>ttBut he is with me everywhere. I only have to 
ttstretch out my hand and I can feel his hand. He 
ttis with me now too. The fire won't hurt me. He 
ttwill protect me from everything evil.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttHas he told you this? 

<b>ttttTYAN 
</b>ttI know it.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttHas he said it?

<b>ttttTYAN 
</b>ttI know it, I know it. You must see him 
ttsomewhere, you must. The priests had no 
ttdifficulty seeing him, nor did the soldiers. 
ttThey are so afraid of him that they don't even 
ttdare touch me.

The sounds of the hammers stops. The soldiers stand like black shadows rooted 
in the moss. They fumble with the chains and pull at the neck iron. TYAN 
moans weakly, as if she were far away.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWhy have you crushed her hands? 

<b>ttttSOLDIER
</b>ttt(surly) 
ttWe didn't do it. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWho did? 

<b>ttttSOLDIER
</b>ttAsk the monk.

The soldiers pull the iron and the chains. TYAN'S shaven head sways, gleaming 
in the moonlight. Her blackened mouth opens as if to scream, but no sound 
emerges. They take her down from the cart and lead her towards the ladder and 
the stake. The KNIGHT turns to the MONK, who remains seated in the cart. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWhat have you done with the child? 

DEATH turns around and looks at him. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttDon't you ever stop asking questions? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttNo, I'll never stop.

The soldiers chain TYAN to the rungs of the ladder. She submits resignedly, 
moans weakly like an animal and tries to ease her body into position.
<b> 
</b>When they have fastened her, they walk over to light the pyre. The KNIGHT 
steps up and leans over her. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttFor a moment I thought of killing the soldiers, 
ttbut it would do no good. She's nearly dead 
ttalready. 

One of the soldiers approaches. Thick smoke wells down from the pyre and 
sweeps over the quiet shadows near the crossroads and the hill.

<b>ttttSOLDIER
</b>ttI've told you to be careful. Don't go too close 
ttto her.

The KNIGHT doesn't heed this warning. He cups his hand, fills it with water 
from the skin and gives it to TYAN. Then he gives her a potion.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttTake this and it will stop the pain.

Smoke billows down over them and they begin to cough. The soldiers step 
forward and raise the ladder against a nearby fir tree. TYAN hangs there 
motionlessly, her eyes wide open.

The KNIGHT straightens up and stands immobile. JONS is behind him, his voice 
nearly choked with rage. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWhat does she see? Can you tell me? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttt(shakes his head) 
ttShe feels no more pain. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttYou don't answer my question. Who watches over 
ttthat child? Is it the angels, or God, or the 
ttDevil, or only the emptiness? Emptiness, my 
ttlord!

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThis cannot be.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttLook at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has 
ttjust made a discovery. Emptiness under the 
ttmoon. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWe stand powerless, our arms hanging at our 
ttsides, because we see what she sees, and our 
ttterror and hers are the same. 
ttt(an outburst) 
ttThat poor little child. I can't stand it, I 
ttcan't stand it ...

His voice sticks in his throat and he suddenly walks away. The KNIGHT mounts
his horse. The travelers depart from the crossroads. TYAN finally closes her 
eyes.
<b> 
</b>

The forest is now very dark. The road winds between the trees. The wagon 
squeaks and rattles over stones and roots. A bird suddenly shrieks.
<b> 
</b>JOF lifts his head and wakes up. He has been asleep with his arms around 
MIA's shoulders. The KNIGHT is sharply silhouetted against the tree trunks.

His silence makes him seem almost unreal. JONS and PLOG are slightly drunk 
and support each other. Suddenly PLOG has to sit down. He puts his hands over 
his face and howls piteously. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttOh, now it came over me again! 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttDon't scream. What came over you?

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttMy wife, damn it. She is so beautiful. She is 
ttso beautiful that she can't be described 
ttwithout the accompaniment of a lyre.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttNow it starts again.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttHer smile is like brandy. Her eyes like 
ttblackberries ...

PLOG searches for beautiful words. He gestures gropingly with his large 
hands.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttt(sighs) 
ttGet up, you tear-drenched pig. We'll lose the 
ttothers.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttYes, of course, of course. Her nose is like a 
ttlittle pink potato; her behind is like a juicy 
ttpear -- yes, the whole woman is like a 
ttstrawberry patch. I can see her in front of me, 
ttwith arms like wonderful cucumbers.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttSaints almighty, stop! You're a very bad poet, 
ttdespite the fact that you're drunk. And your 
ttvegetable garden bores me.

They walk across an open meadow. Here it is a little brighter and the moon 
shimmers behind a thin sky. Suddenly PLOG points a large finger towards the 
edge of the forest. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttLook there.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttDo you see something? 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttThere, over there! 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttI don't see anything.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttHang on to something, my friends. The hour is 
ttnear! Who is that at the edge of the forest if 
ttnot my own dearly beloved, with actor attached?

The two lovers discover PLOG and it's too late. They cannot retreat. SKAT 
immediately takes to his heels. PLOG chases him, swinging his sledge and 
bellowing like a wild boar.

For a few confusing moments the two rivals stumble among the stones and 
bushes in the gray gloom of the forest. The duel begins to look senseless, 
because both of them are equally frightened.

The travelers silently observe this confused performance. LISA screams once 
in a while, more out of duty than out of impulse.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttt(panting) 
ttYou miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven 
ttscurvy bitches, if I were in your lousy rags I 
ttwould be stricken with such eternal shame about 
ttmy breath, my voice, my arms and legs -- in 
ttshort, about my whole body -- that I would 
ttimmediately rid nature of my own embarrassing 
ttself. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttt(angry) 
ttWatch out, you perfumed slob, that I don't fart 
tton you and immediately blow you down to the 
ttactor's own red-hot hell, where you can sit and 
ttrecite monologues to each other until the dust 
ttcomes out of the Devil's ears. 

Then LISA throws herself around her husband's neck. 

<b>ttttLISA 
</b>ttForgive me, dear little husband, I'll never do 
ttit again. I am so sorry and you can't imagine 
tthow terribly that man over there betrayed me. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttI'll kill him anyway.

<b>ttttLISA 
</b>ttYes, do that, just kill him. He isn't even a 
tthuman being.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttHell, he's an actor.

<b>ttttLISA 
</b>ttHe is only a false beard, false teeth, false 
ttsmiles, rehearsed lines, and he's as empty as a 
ttjug. Just kill him. 

LISA sobs with excitement and sorrow. PLOG looks around, a little confused. 
SKAT uses this opportunity. He pulls out a dagger and places the point 
against his breast.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttShe's right. Just kill me. If you thought that 
ttI was going to apologize for being what I am, 
ttyou are mistaken. 

<b>ttttLISA 
</b>ttLook how sickening he is. How he makes a fool 
ttof himself, how he puts on an act. Dear Plog, 
ttkill him. 

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttMy friends, you have only to push, and my 
ttunreality will soon be transformed into a new, 
ttsolid reality. An absolutely tangible corpse.

<b>ttttLISA 
</b>ttDo something then. Kill him.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttt(embarrassed) 
ttHe has to fight me, otherwise I can't kill him.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttYour life's thread now hangs by a very ragged 
ttshred. Idiot, your day is short.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttYou'll have to irritate me a little more to get 
ttme as angry as before.

SKAT looks at the travelers with a pained expression and then lifts his eyes 
towards the night sky. 

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttI forgive all of you. Pray for me sometimes. 

SKAT sinks the dagger into his breast and slowly falls to the ground. The 
travelers stand confused. PLOG rushes forward and begins to pull at SKAT'S hands. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttOh dear, dear, I didn't mean it that way! Look, 
ttthere's no life left in him. I was beginning to 
ttlike him, and in my opinion Lisa was much too 
ttspiteful. 

JOF leans over his colleague.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttHe's dead, totally, enormously dead. In fact, 
ttI've never seen such a dead actor.

<b>ttttLISA 
</b>ttCome on, let's go. This is nothing to mourn 
ttover. He has only himself to blame.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttAnd I have to be married to her. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttWe must go on.

SKAT lies in the grass and keeps the dagger pressed tightly to his breast. 
The travelers depart and soon they have disappeared into the dark forest on 
the other side of the meadow. When SKAT is sure that no one can see him, he 
sits up and lifts the dagger from his breast. It is a stage dagger with a 
blade that pushes into the handle. SKAT laughs to himself.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttNow that was a good scene. I'm really a good 
ttactor. After all, why shouldn't I be a little 
ttpleased with myself? But where shall I go? I'll 
ttwait until it becomes light and then I'll find 
ttthe easiest way out of the forest. I'll climb 
ttup a tree for the time being so that no bears, 
ttwolves or ghosts can get at me.

He soon finds a likely tree and climbs up into its thick foliage. He sits 
down as comfortably as possible and reaches for his food pouch.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttt(yawns) 
ttTomorrow I'll find Jof and Mia and then we'll 
ttgo to the saints' feast in Elsinore. We'll make 
ttlots of money there. 
ttt(yawns)
ttNow, I'll sing a little song to myself: 
ttt(sings) 
ttI am a little bird 
ttWho sings whate'er he will, 
ttAnd when I am in danger 
ttI fling out a pissing trill 
ttAs in the carnal thrill.
ttt(speaks)
ttIt's boring to be alone in the forest tonight. 
ttt(sings) 
ttThe terrible night doesn't frighten me ... 

He interrupts himself and listens. The sound of industrious sawing is heard 
through the silence.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttWorkmen in the forest. Oh, well! 
ttt(sings)
ttThe terrible night doesn't frighten me ... 
ttt(speaks)
ttHey, what the devil ... it's my tree they're 
ttcutting down.

He peers through the foliage. Below him stands a dark figure diligently 
sawing away at the base of the tree. SKAT becomes frightened and angry.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttHey, you! Do you hear me, you tricky bastard? 
ttWhat are you doing with my tree?

The sawing continues without a pause. SKAT becomes more frightened.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttCan't you at least answer me? Politeness costs 
ttso little. Who are you?

DEATH straightens his back and squints up at him. SKAT cries out in terror.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttI'm sawing down your tree because your time is
ttup.
<b>  
</b><b>ttttSKAT
</b>ttIt won't do. I haven't got time.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttSo you haven't got time. 

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttNo, I have my performance. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttThen it's canceled because of death. 

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttMy contract.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttYour contract is terminated. 

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttMy children, my family. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttShame on you, Skat! 

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttYes, I'm ashamed.

DEATH begins to saw again. The tree creaks. 

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttIsn't there any way to get off? Aren't there 
ttany special rules for actors?

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttNo, not in this case. 

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttNo loopholes, no exceptions? 

DEATH saws.

<b>ttttSKAT
</b>ttPerhaps you'll take a bribe. 

DEATH saws.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttSKAT
</b>ttHelp!

DEATH saws.

<b>ttttSKAT 
</b>ttHelp! Help!

The tree falls. The forest becomes silent again.
<b> 
</b>

Night and then dawn.

The travelers have come to a sort of clearing and have collapsed on the moss.
They lie quietly and listen to their own breathing, their heartbeats, and the 
wind in the tree tops. Here the forest is wild and impenetrable. Huge 
boulders stick up out of the ground like the heads of black giants. A fallen 
tree lies like a mighty barrier between light and shadow.

MIA, JOF and their child have sat down apart from the others. They look at 
the light of the moon, which is no longer full and dead but mysterious and 
unstable. The KNIGHT sits bent over his chess game. LISA cries quietly behind 
PLOG'S back. JONS lies on the ground and looks up at the heavens.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttSoon dawn will come, but the heat continues to 
tthang over us like a smothering blanket.

<b>ttttLISA 
</b>ttI'm so frightened.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttWe feel that something is going to happen to 
ttus, but we don't know what.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttMaybe it's the day of judgment. 

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttThe day of judgment ...

Now, something moves behind the fallen tree. There is a rustling sound and a 
moaning cry that seems to come from a wounded animal. Everyone listens
intently, all faces turned towards the sound. A voice comes out of the
darkness. 

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttDo you have some water?

RAVAL'S perspiring face soon becomes visible. He disappears in the darkness, 
but his voice is heard again. 

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttCan't you give me a little water? 
ttt(pause) 
ttI have the plague.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttDon't come here. If you do I'll slit your 
ttthroat. Keep to the other side of the tree. 

<b>ttttRAVEL 
</b>ttI'm afraid of death.

No one answers. There is complete silence. RAVAL gasps heavily for air. The 
dry leaves rustle with his movements. 

<b>ttttRAVEL 
</b>ttI don't want to die! I don't want to!
<b> 
</b>No one answers. RAVAL'S face appears suddenly at the base of the tree. His 
eyes bulge wildly and his mouth is ringed with foam.

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttCan't you have pity on me? Help me! At least 
tttalk to me.

No one answers. The trees sigh. RAVAL begins to cry. 

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttI am going to die. I. I. I! What will happen to 
ttme! Can no one console me? Haven't you any 
ttcompassion? Can't you see that I ...

His words are choked off by a gurgling sound. He disappears in the darkness 
behind the fallen tree. It becomes quiet for a few moments.

<b>ttttRAVAL 
</b>ttt(whispers) 
ttCan't anyone ... only a little water. 

Suddenly the GIRL gets up with a quick movement, snatches JONS'S water bag 
and runs a few steps. JONS grabs her and holds her fast.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttIt's no use. It's no use. I know that it's no 
ttuse. It's meaningless. It's totally 
ttmeaningless. I tell you that it's meaningless. 
ttCan't you hear that I'm consoling you? 

<b>ttttRAVEL 
</b>ttHelp me, help me!

No one answers, no one moves. RAVAL'S sobs are dry and convulsive, like a 
frightened child's. His sudden scream is cut off in the middle. Then it 
becomes quiet.
<b> 
</b>The GIRL sinks down and hides her face in her hands. JONS places his hand on 
her shoulder.
<b> 
</b>
<b>16
</b>The KNIGHT is no longer alone. DEATH has come to him and he raises his hand.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttShall we play our game to the end? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYour move!

DEATH raises his hand and strikes the KNIGHT'S queen. Antonius Block looks at 
<b>DEATH. 
</b>
<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttNow I take your queen. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttI didn't notice that.

The KNIGHT leans over the game. The moonlight moves over the chess pieces, 
which seem to have a life of their own.

JOF has dozed off for a few moments, but suddenly he wakens. Then he sees the 
KNIGHT and DEATH together. He becomes very frightened and awakens MIA. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttMia!
<b> 
</b><b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttYes, what is it?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI see something terrible. Something I almost 
ttcan't talk about.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttWhat do you see?

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttThe knight is sitting over there playing chess. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttYes, I can see that too and I don't think it's 
ttso terrible. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttBut do you see who he's playing with? 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttHe is alone. You mustn't frighten me this way.
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttNo, no, he isn't alone. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttWho is it, then?
<b> 
</b><b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttDeath. He is sitting there playing chess with 
ttDeath himself.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttYou mustn't say that. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttWe must try to escape. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttOne can't do that.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttWe must try. They are so occupied with their 
ttgame that if we move very quietly, they won't 
ttnotice us. 

JOF gets up carefully and disappears into the darkness behind the trees. MIA 
remains standing, as if paralyzed by fear. She stares fixedly at the KNIGHT 
and the chess game. She holds her son in her arms. Now JOF returns.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI have harnessed the horse. The wagon is 
ttstanding near the big tree. You go first and 
ttI'll follow you with the packs. See that Mikael 
ttdoesn't wake up.

MIA does what JOF has told her. At the same moment, the KNIGHT looks up from
his game. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttIt is your move, Antonius Block.

The KNIGHT remains silent. He sees MIA go through the moonlight towards the
wagon. JOF bends down to pick up the pack and follows at a distance. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttHave you lost interest in our game?
<b> 
</b>The KNIGHT'S eyes become alarmed. DEATH looks at him intently.

<b>ttttKNIGHT
</b>ttLost interest? On the contrary.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttYou seem anxious. Are you hiding anything? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttNothing escapes you -- or does it? 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttNothing escapes me. No one escapes from me. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttIt's true that I'm worried.

He pretends to be clumsy and knocks the chess pieces over with the hem of his 
coat. He looks up at DEATH. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT
</b>ttI've forgotten how the pieces stood.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttt(laughs contentedly) 
ttBut I have not forgotten. You can't get away 
ttthat easily.
<b> 
</b>DEATH leans over the board and rearranges the pieces. The KNIGHT looks past 
him towards the road. MIA has just climbed up on the wagon. JOF takes the 
horse by the bridle and leads it down the road. DEATH notices nothing; he is 
completely occupied with reconstructing the game.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttNow I see something interesting. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWhat do you see?

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttYou are mated on the next move, Antonius Block. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttThat's true.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttDid you enjoy your reprieve? 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttYes, I did.

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttI'm happy to hear that. Now I'll be leaving you. 
ttWhen we meet again, you and your companions' 
tttime will be up.

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttAnd you will divulge your secrets. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttI have no secrets. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttSo you know nothing. 

<b>ttttDEATH 
</b>ttI have nothing to tell.

The KNIGHT wants to answer, but DEATH is already gone.

A murmur is heard in the tree tops. Dawn comes, a flickering light without 
life, making the forest seem threatening and evil. JOF drives over the 
twisting road. MIA sits beside him. 

<b>ttttMIA
</b>ttWhat a strange light.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI guess it's the thunderstorm which comes with 
ttdawn. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttNo, it's something else. Something terrible. Do 
ttyou hear the roar in the forest? 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttIt's probably rain.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttNo, it isn't rain. He has seen us and he's 
ttfollowing us. He has overtaken us; he's coming 
tttowards us. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttNot yet, Mia. In any case, not yet. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttI'm so afraid. I'm so afraid.

The wagon rattles over roots and stones; it sways and creaks. Now the horse 
stops with his ears flat against his head. The forest sighs and stirs 
ponderously. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttGet into the wagon, Mia. Crawl in quickly. 
ttWe'll lie down, Mia, with Mikael between us.

They crawl into the wagon and crouch around the sleeping child.

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttIt is the Angel of Death that's passing over 
ttus, Mia. It's the Angel of Death. The Angel of 
ttDeath, and he's very big.

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttDo you feel how cold it is? I'm freezing. I'm 
ttterribly cold.

She shivers as if she had a fever. They pull the blankets over them and lie 
closely together. The wagon canvas flutters and beats in the wind. The roar 
outside is like a giant bellowing.
<b> 
</b>

The castle is silhouetted like a black boulder against the heavy dawn. Now
the storm moves there, throwing itself powerfully against walls and
abutments.  The sky darkens; it is almost like night.

Antonius Block has brought his companions with him to the castle. But it
seems deserted. They walk from room to room. There is only emptiness and
quiet echoes. Outside, the rain is heard roaring noisily.

Suddenly the KNIGHT stands face to face with his wife. They look at each
other quietly.

<b>ttttKARIN
</b>ttI heard from people who came from the crusade 
ttthat you were on your way home. I've been 
ttwaiting for you here. All the others have fled 
ttfrom the plague. 

The KNIGHT is silent. He looks at her. 

<b>ttttKARIN 
</b>ttDon't you recognize me any more? 

The KNIGHT nods, silent. 

<b>ttttKARIN 
</b>ttYou also have changed.

She walks closer and looks searchingly into his face. The smile lingers in 
her eyes and she touches his hand lightly.

<b>ttttKARIN 
</b>ttNow I can see that it's you. Somewhere in your 
tteyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and 
ttfrightened, is that boy who went away so many 
ttyears ago. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttIt's over now and I'm a little tired. 

<b>ttttKARIN 
</b>ttI see that you're tired. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttOver there stand my friends.

<b>ttttKARIN 
</b>ttAsk them in. They will break the fast with us. 

They all sit down at the table in the room, which is lit by torches on the 
walls. Silently they eat the hard bread and the salt-darkened meat. KARIN 
sits at the head of the table and reads aloud from a thick book. 

<b>ttttKARIN 
</b>tt"And when the Lamb broke the seventh seal, 
ttthere was silence in heaven for about the space 
ttof half an hour. And I saw the seven angels 
ttwhich stood before God; and to them were given 
ttseven trumpets. And another ..." 

Three mighty knocks sound on the large portal. KARIN interrupts her reading 
and looks up from the book. JONS rises quickly and goes to open the door.

<b> ttttKARIN 
</b>tt"The first angel sounded, and there followed 
tthail and fire mingled with blood, and they were 
ttcast upon the earth; and the third part of the 
tttrees was burnt up and all the green grass was 
ttburnt up."

Now the rain becomes quiet. There is suddenly an immense, frightening silence 
in the large, murky room where the burning torches throw uneasy shadows over 
the ceiling and the walls. Everyone listens tensely to the stillness.

<b> ttttKARIN 
</b>tt"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a 
ttgreat mountain burning with fire was cast into 
ttthe sea; and a third part of the sea became 
ttblood ..."

Steps are heard on the stairs. JONS returns and sits down silently at his 
place but does not continue to eat. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttWas someone there? 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttNo, my lord. I saw no one.

KARIN lifts her head for a moment but once again leans over the large book.

<b>ttttKARIN 
</b>tt"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a 
ttgreat star from heaven, burning as it were a 
tttorch, and it fell upon the third part of the 
ttrivers and upon the fountains of waters; and 
ttthe name of the star is called Wormwood ..." 

They all lift their heads, and when they see who is coming towards them
through the twilight of the large room, they rise from the table and stand 
close together. 

<b>ttttKNIGHT 
</b>ttGood morning, noble lord.

<b>ttttKARIN 
</b>ttI am Karin, the knight's wife, and welcome you 
ttcourteously to my house.

<b>ttttPLOG 
</b>ttI am a smith by profession and rather good at 
ttmy trade, if I say so myself. My wife Lisa -- 
ttcurtsy for the great lord, Lisa. She's a little 
ttdifficult to handle once in a while and we had
tta little spat, so to speak, but no worse than 
ttmost people.

The KNIGHT hides his face in his hands.

<b>ttttKNIGHT
</b>ttFrom our darkness, we call out to Thee, Lord. 
ttHave mercy on us because we are small and 
ttfrightened and ignorant. 

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttt(bitterly) 
ttIn the darkness where You are supposed to be, 
ttwhere all of us probably are.... In the 
ttdarkness You will find no one to listen to Your 
ttcries or be touched by Your sufferings. Wash 
ttYour tears and mirror Yourself in Your 
ttindifference.

<b>ttttKNIGHT
</b> ttGod, You who are somewhere, who must be 
ttsomewhere, have mercy upon us.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttI could have given you an herb to purge you of 
ttyour worries about eternity. Now it seems to be 
tttoo late. But in any case, feel the immense 
tttriumph of this last minute when you can still 
ttroll your eyes and move your toes. 

<b>ttttKARIN 
</b>ttQuiet, quiet.

<b>ttttJONS 
</b>ttI shall be silent, but under protest. 

<b>ttttGIRL 
</b>ttt(on her knees)
ttIt is the end.
<b> 
</b>

JOF and MIA sit close together and listen to the rain tapping lightly on the 
wagon canvas, a sound which diminishes until finally there are only single 
drops. 

They crawl out of their hiding place. The wagon stands on a height above a 
slope, protected by an enormous tree. They look across ridges, forests, the 
wide plains, and the sea, which glistens in the sunlight breaking through the 
clouds.
<b> 
</b>JOF stretches his arms and legs. MIA dries the wagon seat and sits down next
to her husband. MIKAEL crawls between JOF'S knees.

A lone bird tests its voice after the storm. The trees and bushes drip. From 
the sea comes a strong and fragrant wind.

JOF points to the dark, retreating sky where summer lightning glitters like 
silver needles over the horizon. 

<b>ttttJOF 
</b>ttI see them, Mia! I see them! Over there against 
ttthe dark, stormy sky. They are all there. The 
ttsmith and Lisa and the knight and Raval and 
ttJx88ns and Skat. And Death, the severe master, 
ttinvites them to dance. He tells them to hold 
tteach other's hands and then they must tread the 
ttdance in a long row. And first goes the master 
ttwith his scythe and hourglass, but Skat dangles 
ttat the end with his lyre. They dance away from 
ttthe dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the 
ttdark lands, while the rain washes their faces 
ttand cleans the salt of the tears from their 
ttcheeks. 

He is silent. He lowers his hand. His son, MIKAEL, has listened to his words.
Now, he crawls up to MIA and sits down in her lap. 

<b>ttttMIA 
</b>ttt(smiling) 
ttYou with your visions and dreams.
