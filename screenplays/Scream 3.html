<b>EHREN KRUGER
</b>
2nd DRAFT - REVISED

<b>MAY 2, 1999
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
A big dramatic crescendo as we --

<b>ttttttttOPEN ON:
</b>
<b>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - SUNSET - AERIAL
</b>
Friday night traffic as usual. Things appear to be backed up all the way to 
the valley. A cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly 
<b>DISSOLVE INTO:
</b>
<b>INT.  FORD EXPLORER - NIGHT
</b>
A new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock. Behind the wheel is hot 
teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody BEN DAMON. Ben is handsome, studly, in 
his early 20s. However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city 
of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick. Ben's in the middle of a heated 
argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy.

<b>tttt BEN
</b>tttt(into cell)
tttGod dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap!
tttI'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right
tttNow, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got
ttta bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and
tttI'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that
tttin all your squandering the best you can do for me is
tttA bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on!
tttIt's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you
tttoffer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've
tttworked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and
tttyou offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should 
tttfire you and go to ICM.

<b>ttttCATHY(O.S.)
</b>ttt   (off phone)
tttBen, I will not sit around and listen to you bad 
tttmouth me! Without me you would've never gotten as
tttfamous as you are today. The least you can do is
tttshow me a little god damn respect.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt   (into phone)
tttYou want Respect, Cathy? Here's your respect.
tttFUCK YOU! You're fired.
ttt   (Ben hangs up)
tttUnfucking believable.

Ben socks the steering wheel out of frustration. The horn blares 
uncomfortably.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>tttStab 3: Return To Woodsboro. 
tttPah. What's next, Friday The 13TH PART 15:
<b>tttJASON DOES BROADWAY?
</b>
Ben's phone rings. He answers it.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt   (into phone)
tttWhat's up, B.D. with the B.D.

<b>ttttWOMAN'S VOICE
</b>ttt   (off phone)
tttHardly as large as I'd like it to be.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>tttChristine?

<b>ttttCHRISTINE(O.S.)
</b>tttNo, Jennifer Love Hewitt.
tttOf course it's me, silly.
tttAnd I feel like an ass standing
tttin this theater lobby all by myself.
tttWhere are you babe, the movie starts
tttin twenty minutes.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>tttLook, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think
tttthere was some big accident. It could be
ttta little while so I don't want you to start
tttfreaking if I don't get there at exactly,
tttt(checks watch)
tttEight thirty.

<b>ttttCHRISTINE(O.S.)
</b>tttAll I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally
tttp.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt   (putting up faux-enthusiasm)
tttOh I wouldn't miss it for the world.
tttI bet you did such a great job.

<b>ttttCHRISTINE(O.S.)
</b>tttI did. Hon, although I got a total of
tttsix minutes screen time, they're the
tttbest six minutes of the movie.

<b>tttt BEN
</b>tttHeh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are.
tttLook, my battery's dying . . .
<b>tt
</b>But of course, we notice Ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the 
conversation short.

<b>ttttCHRISTINE(O.S.)
</b>tttAlright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down.

Ben smiles.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt Sure thing.

Ben hangs up. He reclines back in his seat. Camera slowly pans out the 
windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. He's not going 
anywhere.

<b>CLOSE ON GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
</b>
Ben opens the glove compartment. Papers scatter out. Ben reaches for a card.

<b>CLOSE ON CARD -
</b>
A small white business card:   1-900-WET-4-COCK

Ben smiles, begins to dial out when suddenly, RING RING! The cell comes to 
life in his hand.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt  (startled)
tttJesus.
ttt  (answers call)
tttHello?
<b>t
</b><b>ttttVOICE
</b>tttHello.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>tttWho is this?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tttWho is this?

tAt this point we know who the caller is. It's the nightmarish t
tdeep voice we've all come to know and hate from the first twot
tfilms. It's never sounded so evil. So sexy.


<b>ttttBEN
</b>tttWell what number are you trying to reach?

<b>tttt VOICE
</b>ttt I don't know.

<b>tttt BEN
</b>tttI think you got the wrong number, buddy.

<b>tttt VOICE
</b>tttDo I?

<b>tttt BEN
</b>ttt  (peeved)
tttUh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out.
tttReally wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tttWait, wait. Don't hang up.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt  (angrily)
tttAsshole, Can't talk.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tttBut your voice sounds so familiar.

Ben smiles.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>tttDoes it now?


<b>ttttVOICE
</b>You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben 
Damon.

<b>tttt BEN
</b>ttt   (smiling profusely)
tttWell ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.

<b>tttt VOICE
</b>tttReally? You're such a talented actor.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt  (loves the praise)
tttThanks.

<b>ttt VOICE
</b>tttNow let's see you act your way out of this one.

The voice seems to have changed tones. It now sounds a lot harsher, angrier if 
you will.

<b>tttt BEN
</b>tttWhat do you mean?

<b>tttt VOICE
</b>tttI mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES 
tttROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend 
tttChristine is in there.  She's all alone. 
tttEveryone's in the auditorium waiting for the film 
tttto start.
ttt   (laughs coldly)
tttI've got my knife.

*NOTE: At this point we intercut shots of the empty lobby and halls of the 
PLAZA THEATER. A POV shot standing outside the LADIES ROOM door.

<b>tttt BEN
</b>ttt (turning pale)
tttListen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?

<b>tttt VOICE
</b>tttMore of a game really. 

<b>tttt BEN
</b>tttWhat kind of a game?

<b>tttt VOICE
</b>tttYou seem to be familiar with the STAB movies.
tttHere's how we play. I ask you a question. 
tttYou get it right, your girlfriend lives. 
tttYou answer wrong, she dies.

<b>tttt BEN
</b>tttI swear to God if you lay a finger on her 
tttI'll fucking kill you!

<b>tttt VOICE
</b>tttMaybe so, but right now, we play the game. 
tttFirst question, Your girlfriend's counting on 
tttyou, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?

Ben groans. He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only  he'd have 
paid attention to Christine he might have known this.


<b>tttt VOICE
</b>tttCome on. Don't you know?
<b>tt
</b>
<b>tttt BEN
</b>tttt  (hesitating)
tttIt's CICI! Cici's the name of the character 
tttshe plays in the movie!

<b>tttt VOICE
</b>tttVery good. Now we play ROUND 2. 

<b>ttttBEN
</b>tttWhat?! But I did everything you said to do!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tttThat's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're 
ttttaking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me 
tttbeneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. 
tttI'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>tttWhat?!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tttGood bye Ben.
<b>t
</b>Click. The killer hangs up. Ben flips open the phone, dials 911. Ringing and 
then . . .

<b>ttttRECORDED MESSAGE
</b>ttt   (off phone)
tttDue to the high volume of calls this evening,
tttDispatch is temporarily shut down. If this is
tttnot a real emergency please call another dep-

Ben hangs up, dials CHRISTINE's number. RINGING, then--

<b>tttt VOICE
</b>tttYou're not playing by the rules Ben.
tttDon't you want her to live?

<b>tttt BEN
</b>tttI swear to God if you lay one hand on her!

<b>tttt VOICE
</b>tttNo! You listen to me, if you're not where I want
tttyou in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out.
tttDo you understand? 

IN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming.

The killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV 
into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car 
screeches down the off ramp.

<b>tttttttt CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
</b>
Ben comes screeching around the corner in his FORD EXPLORER.  Tires smoking. 
Sparks flying. The HOLLYWOOD sign stands like an impending pall in the 
awaiting b.g.

<b>tttttttt CUT TO:
</b>

<b>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT
</b>
The SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps 
out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing 
ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into 
his SUV, gets an idea.

<b>THE BACK --
</b>
--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not 
gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE 
SLUGGER with "ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER" written across it. 

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt   (to himself)
tttThank God I decided to do some community service.

Ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards 
the sign when suddenly --

<b>HIS CELL RINGS.
</b>
Ben answers the call.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt  (into phone)
tttYeah.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tttVery good. You follow directions well.
tttNow for the final part of the game.
tttPut down the bat and approach the sign,
tttslowly.

Ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. He approaches the 
sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt  (into phone)
tttWhere are you?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tttCloser than you think.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt  (into phone)
tttAlright I'm here. What the fuck do you want
tttfrom me?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tttTo see your reaction.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>tttReaction to what?

Ben passes under the huge, pallid "H" in the sign. What seems at first like a 
gentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead. He rolls back his head, his legs 
turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.


<b>ttttBEN
</b><b>tttOHMYGOD! NO!
</b><b>tttCHRISTINE --
</b>
Has been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in 
the "H" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the 
Southern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows, 
not seeing --

THE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand.  In one quick, brutal 
stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around, 
face to face with his attacker.

<b>ttttBEN
</b>ttt  (screaming)
<b>tttBUT I'M THE KILLER IN STAB 3!
</b><b>tt
</b><b>ttttTHE GHOST
</b>tttYou just lost the role Ben.
tttConsider this your parting gift.

AND WITH that, the GHOST drives the bloodstained knife into Ben's heart, 
causing a vicious eruption of crimson.

<b>tttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>tTITLE CARD.   "SCREAM 3"
</b>
<b>tttttttttOPEN ON:
</b>
<b>tEXT.  TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY
</b>
GALE WEATHERS, the flashy thirty-something news anchor and author of the 
WOODSBORO MURDERS. She sits behind a desk on the really ditzy, loud set for 
TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT, an ET style program with a live studio audience.

<b>tttt GALE
</b>tttGood morning Hollywood. And today
tttofficially starts the Summer movie
tttseason. Opening the box office this
tttweek is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins
tttin Arlington Street,  Eugene Levy
tttand Jason Biggs in American Pastry,
tttand Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
tttin STAB 2, based off my best selling
tttbook the WINDSOR MURDERS. 

CAMERA pans across the audience. Many of them are dressed as the GHOST. A sea 
of white screaming faces. Very eerie and unsettling.

<b>tttt GALE
</b>tttWell I see a lot of the audience has dressed
tttto the occasion. Today we have director of the
tttupcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman
tttBridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice
tttwelcome to the set of Total Entertainment.
<b>t
</b>The crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as ROMAN BRIDGER, 
ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy 
white suit. He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a STAB 3 coffee 
mug beside Gale's hand.

<b>ttttROMAN
</b>tttGood morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttIt's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.

<b>ttttROMAN
</b>ttt   (addressing audience)
tttWell it's a honor to be here amongst so
tttmany fans of the genre. And I must say
tttthat any of you worried that Jerry Rapp,
tttor Tori or David not returning to complete
tttthe STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is
ttthere. Aided with my excellent cast of
tttnewcomers I believe we're going to pull
tttoff one of the best Stabs yet.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttRoman, from your enthusiasm it certainly
tttseems that way.
tttt(a beat)
tttHonestly though, 
tttt(smiles) 
ttttell us, what'styour favorite scary movie?

<b>ttttROMAN
</b>ttt  (a long pause)
tttHonestly, my life.

A eclectic hush falls over the crowd. Roman appears somewhat sinister in this 
light. Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttYour life?

<b>ttttROMAN
</b>tttWell if you were in my shoes, dealing with 
tttthose big Time Sunrise Studio producers like 
tttI do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick 
tttyour life goes from a Walt Disney picture to 
ttta Tobe Hooper flick.

Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into 
applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second 
rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of 
the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her 
imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as 
if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.

A LOUD BUZZING O.S.  Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign 
hanging over the stage. THE WORD "COMMERCIAL BREAK" is illuminated in flashing 
red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to 
Roman.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttWould you excuse me for a moment?

<b>ttttROMAN
</b>ttt  (smiling)
tttSure.

Gale bolts for --

<b>INT.  BACKSTAGE - TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT SET - DAY
</b>
Gale races around the corner of the set, smashing right into -

DETECTIVE MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Mid-thirties. Handsome with piercing eyes. He 
grabs Gale by her shoulders, shepherding her aside.

<b>ttttGALEt
</b>tttJesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>tttI'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to 
tttintroduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.
ttt  (flashes badge)
tttAre you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, 
tttor the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttWell I interviewed Damon once for the show.
tttHe was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the 
tttsecond one, Christine Perkins, she had a part 
tttin Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>tttBoth of them were found brutally murdered this 
tttmorning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy 
tttreports having come back to me yet but the 
tttbodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.  

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttSo is that why you're here? Is that why you're 
tttholding me from my show, to tell me about some 
tttbrutal homicide I'm not even involved in?

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>tttI wish that was all Miss Weathers, but 
tttthere's more. The killer left a note.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttA note?

Detective Kincaid reaches into his back pocket, pulls up a newspaper clipping 
in a ziplock evidence bag. He holds the bag up For Gale to see.

EXTREMELY CLOSE on the ARTICLE . . . "MAUREEN PRESCOTT, MOTHER AND WIFE, FOUND 
BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED IN BEDROOM". A b/w photo of Sidney's mother 
Maureen stands hauntingly before the camera.

<b>ttttGALE(O.S.)
</b>tttThat's Sidney Prescott's mother.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID(O.S.)
</b>tttThere's more.

Kincaid flips the article over. Someone has scrawled in black marker across 
the back "SIDNEY".

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>tttI've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott,
tttbut she's keeping herself very well hidden.
tttYou're my one and only hope in finding her.
tttHer life may be in grave danger.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttI'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being
tttsliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but
tttI honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor
tttshe dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other
tttperson that might know is, 
ttt  (gale hesitates), 
tttnot going to talk.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>tttAnd who would that be?

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS BACK LOT - DAY
</b>
A red BMW convertible speeds through the back lot. Behind the wheel is DEWEY 
RIELLY. Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of 
<b>. . . STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO.
</b>
All around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. Dewey 
parks his car outside a soundstage, exits.

<b>tttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  STAB 3 SET - DAY
</b>
A huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane 
hanger.  In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes. In another 
corner stands the infamous Becker house where the nightmare all began. In 
other regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the 
Woodsboro Police Station,  A TOP STORY news van, etc.

DEWEY, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego --

TOM PRINZE, a Hollywood poster boy. Very cool. Not so debonair. A shoddy copy 
of Dewey at best. However, the conversation between the two is friendly, and 
they exchange greetings.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>tttHey Dew, did you hear?

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttNo, what?

<b>ttttTOM
</b>tttSomebody iced Ben Damon and his girlfriend.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttThat's Hollywood Tom. One day you're
tttmaking movies in the hills, the next day 
tttyou're posing for the coroner downtown on a slab.

Dewey's obviously gotten a lot colder since the last film. He walks past a 
clique of STAB 3'S MAIN CAST:

There's:

SARAH DARLING: 30, playing a 25 year old bimbo. Very hot. Very blonde. Ample 
cleavage.

ANGELINA TYLER: 20. Extremely nadve looking. She won her part in STAB 3 
playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest. She's timid, with short dark 
hair. Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got.

And also the loveable

TYSON JACKSON: late 20's, African-American, all attitude.

The three flip through pages of the STAB 3 script, conversing freely about the 
production.

<b>tttt SARAH
</b>tttGoddamnit I am getting so fed up with
tttthese re-writes. It's like every five
tttminutes there's a new script. God, and
tttyou just know this all because of STAB 2's
tttscript winding up on the internet two months
tttafter it wrapped shooting.

<b>ttttTYSON
</b>tttAnd still the film is Number One at the box
tttoffice this weekend. Beat out American Pasty
tttand Arlington Street.

<b>ttttANGELINA
</b>tttI think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.

<b>ttttTYSON
</b>tttNah I think it's doing so damn well because
tttone of it's players got iced. I just hope
tttnone of us end up dead.

<b>ttttANGELINA
</b>tttOh that's right. Those poor poor people.
tttGod Ben Damon was such a hottie.

<b>ttttTYSON
</b>tttt (sighs)
tttAnd that CICI chick wasn't that bad either
tttbut I'm really concerned about my safety 
tttnow.

<b>ttttSARAH

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttWould you give that script a rest?t
tttIt's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.

<b>ttttTYSON
</b>tttI'm just saying, though. What if there's
tttsomeone out there stalking actors? Huh?
tttThen what?

<b>ttttANGELINA
</b>tttThere's always someone out there stalking

</b>tttI know who you're talking about. Rebecca

tttSonny Bono had a stalker. David Letterman had one
ttttoo. So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds,
tttJody Foster, --

<b>ttttTYSON
</b>tttListen Miss ingxe9nue, your cheering me up to much,
tttGive it a break.

Tom walks into frame, sits down next to Angelina, subtly putting his arm 
around her. She shoves him away.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>tttWhat? What'd I do? Relax your crack sweetheart
tttI didn't rip those two fucks up last night.
tttJeez.
ttt   (lights up a smoke)
tttSo what are you doing tonight?

Totally repulsed, Angelina gets up, races off set.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>tttTalk about moody.

Tom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at Sarah with 
bedroom eyes.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>tttAnd how about you good looking?
tttGot any plans for later?

<b>ttttSARAH
</b>tttEww yeah, finding a guy to have sex
tttwith that doesn't look like you.

Sarah, following suit laid by Angelina, scampers off set. Tom looks up at 
Tyson, smoke blowing out his nostrils.

<b>ttttTYSON
</b>tttOh no. I ain't into that shit.

Tyson races off set. Tom laughs, covers his face.

<b>ttttttt  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>DETECTIVE KINCAID AND GALE.
</b>
They walk through the set. Gale's mesmerized. Kincaid is all business.

<b>tttt GALE
</b>tttDxe9jr vu-do.

The pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher 
Residence. Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat 
on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. Even a foam dummy Of TATUM RIELLY 
dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess.

GALE stares at the swaying dummy, haunted.

<b>tttt VOICE(O.S.)
</b>tttWell well, someone dies and Gale Weathers
tttcomes running. What a shock.

GALE looks up. DEWEY stands beside her.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID

tttI'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you awaretof last night's
tttEvents?

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttYeah. A real tragedy.

Dewey stares daggers through Gale. There is a real bitter coldness between the 
two.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttDewey, personal lives and pasts aside, 
tttthis is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttWhat so you can just exploit her again with another

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttt  (to Kincaid)
tttShow him.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>tttMr. Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of

Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly 
growing.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttI promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion.
tttI promised her nobody would ever find her.
tttIf you don't mind Detective, I'd like to
tttapproach her with this on my own and see
tttwhat she'd like to do about it.

Kincaid nods.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>tttThat's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else

Dewey walks off camera. Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>tttI'm going to have a little chat with the

Jennifer Jolie, an ambitious young starlet, playing GALE in the latest Stab, 
rushes towards her, with arms wide open. She's decked out in the flashy neon 
green ensemble Gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on 
her right eye. Gale is obviously pissed. She knows this actress and doesn't 
really want to be in her company very long.

ttttGale
tttShit.

ttttJennifer
tttListen, I know we've never met, and 
tttI don't mind you never returning my calls,

Dewey walks away leaving Gale alone. Kincaid enters frame, ttalking to two 
producers. The elder, sixty-five year old BUDDY SHAYNE, a towering, hefty man 
with gray hair. The second, bigwig horror producer JOHN MILTON, a creepy 
fifty-something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor. The two talk, 
ignoring Gale the entire time.  She's almost eavesdropping on their 
conversation.

trickling down his mouth. Sarah lets out a bloodcurdling scream while Tyson 
breaks into hysterics.

Sarah momentarily glances behind her, just noticing, a pair of black work 
boots stepping off the costume rack. Before Sarah has a chance to scream, the 
ghost jumps down and shoves the rack hard sending a screaming Sarah into the 
next room. She goes flying out, slamming into a metal table covered with prop 
weapons.

<b>THE GHOST --
</b>
Stomps into the second prop room, knife raised. Sarah leaps up, starts to 
chuck the prop knives at her attacker, screaming furiously.

THE PROP knives, hit the ghost, and bend as they bounce off his body and onto 
the floor. The killer shakes his head angrily, stalks towards his prey.

The ghost drives his knife into Sarah's chest, once, twice, and delivers a 
final killing blow to her Adam's apple. She staggers forward. Her killer grabs 
her by her long buxom hair, and hucks her into a glass door.

THE DOOR EXPLODES, SARAH'S BODY falling through, shards of glass tearing out 
her back.

THE KILLER, stands in the shattered doorway, bloody knife in hand. An alarm

tttDewey, I got into this shit cause the police

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttYou said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttOff the record.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttAlways.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttTwo months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a

tttsee the file on Sid, for research.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttAnd?

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttThe boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name.  
tttA month later, the station gets broken into,

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttSomeone stole Sid's file?

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttI already removed it.  I think someone on the

</b>tttAnd who is that?

But Dewey doesn't answer. Again, he's staring daggers through Gale.  Years and 
years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttJennifer needs me.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttJennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?

<b>ttttDEWEY

A nice low ranch tucked away in the valley. Dewey rolls up Jennifer's driveway 
in his truck. Gale follows behind in her VW JETTA.

Dewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house. Gale runs back to 
shut off her car. From out of the bushes lunges --

TOM PRINZE, loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of JOHNNY 
WALKER BLACK LABEL SCOTCH in his hand.

Gale and Tom enter. Jennifer is crying hysterically in Dewey's arms. She sees 
Gale, looks up with anger written all over her gaudy, over rouged face, her 
make-up running in a comical, almost homage to Mimi on the Drew Carey Show.

<b>ttttJENNIFER

</b>tttGod damn you Gale Weathers! 
tttDon't you see? The killer is choosing  his

tttBen Damon's character was the first one to get offed.
tttSo was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so 
ttthis real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's 
tttCandy, and now me!

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttWait a second, whoa! Calm down!
tttNumber one there were five different 
tttversions of the script given out.
tttBen Damon was given a fake script because 
ttthe was only being offered the role.
tttIt only had fragments of real scenes from the 
tttactual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?

Everyone is silent. Dewey nods his head. Gale rips the script from Jennifer's 
hands.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttt  (reading script)
<b>tttAND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH!
</b>tttThis is complete bullshit.
tttWho wrote this piece of crap?

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>tttI know right. It was kinda weak.
tttThat's cause Will Kennison only wrote 
ttta rough treatment of it.
tttThe script was written by some new guy. 
tttHe wrote Arlington Street.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttStill that was a much better movie,
tttI saw it at the premiere last week.
tttGod, what the hell am I getting sidetracked

A teary-eyed Angelina Tyler rises up from the couch, approaches the group.

tttWhat are you talking about?
tttBecause of this shit I'll probably never 
tttact in a Hollywood film again.

Tom throws his arm around Angelina, squeezes her tightly.

tttand try you out for a few films my  production

Angelina squeals in disgust, elbows Tom, racing out of the house.  Tom groans,

ttt  (pauses)
tttDamn it. There goes my chances of getting
tttsome head from her.

 Tom whips out a joint, pops it in his mouth. He lights it, walks around the 
side of the house. A noise catches his attention.   A low, muffled squealing.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>tttAaaangelina?

Tom turns to a guest house. The door is half open, darkness  spilling out. Tom 
smirks, steps inside.

<b>   CUT TO:
</b>
<b> INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

 The entire small interior of the GUEST HOUSE / DEWEY'S LIVING QUARTER'S IS 
BLACKENED BY THE NIGHT. Tom cockily waltzes about, not noticing one of the 
black shadows peeling off the wall.

<b>IT'S THE GHOST!
</b>
<b>ttttTOM
</b>tttAngelina?

 Tom stops in his tracks. He looks down. Lying in a pool of blood at his feet 
is ANGELINA TYLER! Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of --

<b>  THE GHOST --
</b>
<b>ttttTOM
</b>tttYou fucker!

 The GHOST slashes open Tom's arm. Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen. The 
ghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air. He slowly begins to 
lift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow. Tom 
gags. He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a  
trickle of blood down his lips.

<b>ttttTOM
</b>ttt  (gagging)
tttFucker!

THE GHOST brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the 
closet. Tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp. The GHOST 
steps back, admiring his work.

Suddenly, a knock at the door. The three are startled. Dewey looks at the 
front door.

</b>tttSsh. Maybe it's Tom or Angelina.
tttI'll get it.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>tttWhat if it's the killer?

tttDo the killers ever knock on the fucking door? 
tttEver see Jason do that before burying an axe in 
tttsome big titted blonde's head? Or maybe Michael or 
tttChucky? Huh?

Jennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale. Dewey reaches into a holster tucked 
away under his jacket, drawing up his 9mm.

</b>tttDon't worry. I'm prepared for anything.

</b>tttAmen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!

Dewey nods his head, slowly makes his way towards the door. Gale and Jennifer 
huddle together, follow close behind.

</b>tttDo you smell something?

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>ttt  (smirking)
tttIt's Gale. She farts when she gets nervous.

Gale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully. 
Dewey steps up to the front door. IT'S NOT LOCKED.  He reaches for the knob, 
turns it when suddenly --

<b>THE POWER SIZZLES OUT!

</b>
<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttHurry! Everyone out the back way! Now!

Dewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading 
outside to the pool and backyard. A PHONE RINGS somewhere in the house.

THE GHOST comes running out of closet, knife swinging wildly. Jennifer 
screams, races for the patio door. The ghost lunges for Gale. Dewey draws up 
his gun, fires.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The GHOST takes six slugs
In the chest.  He goes smashing through a coffee table, motionless. Dewey 
backs into Gale's arms, smoke rising fromthe muzzle of the gun.

The ghost barrels out from under the couch, knife raised. Dewey winds back, 
kicks a chair out in the Ghost's path. The ghost trips, goes crashing through 
the chair, coming smashing down onto the floor, knife burying into the 
hardwood. Dewey and Gale run for the patio when suddenly --

JENNIFER comes dodging out of the kitchen wielding a butcher knife.

Jennifer slips on something, goes backflipping to the ground. Gale grabs her.

THE GHOST comes to life, grabbing a lighter off an end table. He lights  a 
trail of gasoline, running from the floor to the kitchen (i.e. the smell 
Jennifer mentioned earlier and what she slipped on seconds ago). A HUGE flame 
trail lunges towards the two women. They scream.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttBut we know who killed Maureen Prescott, 
tttBilly Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they 
ttteven told Sidney how they did it!  

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID
</b>tttYeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in 
tttyour book that Sidney got it wrong before.  
tttShe accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, 
tttand he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a

Kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttI told you, I don't know where Sidney is.  
tttAnd even if there was a third killer, 
tttSidney doesn't know about it.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE KINCAID

so nefariously at Dewey.

</b>tttOK, look.  We all know that this has something to

Kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag. Within is a blurry 5x4 of 
MAUREEN PRESCOTT exiting a motel room with COTTON WEARY. Kincaid turns it 
over. Also, written on it's back is 'I KILLED HER'

<b>INT. TRAILER - STUDIO LOT - DAY
</b>
Sidney, Gale, Karen, and Dewey are gathered around the inside of the small, 
cramped trailer watching the tape. 

<b>ttttSIDNEY
</b>ttt Oh MY god.

<b>ttttRANDY
</b>tttWell, if you're watching this tape, it means 
tttas I feared, I did not survive these killings 
ttthere at Windsor College.   Anyway, the reason 
tttI am here is to help you, so that my death 
tttwill not be in vain.  That my life's work, will 
ttthelp save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.  
tttIf this killer does come back, and he's for real, 
tttthere are a few things that you gotta remember.  
tttIs this simply another sequel?  Well, if it is, same 
tttrules apply.  But, here's the critical thing.  If you 
tttfind yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory, 
tttand a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel 
tttrules do not apply.  Because you are not dealing 
tttwith a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding 
tttchapter of a trilogy.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttA trilogy?


<b>ttttRANDY
</b>tttThat's right.  It's a rarity in the horror field, 
tttbut it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned 
tttwith, because true trilogies are all about going back 
tttto the beginning and discovering something that wasn't 
ttttrue from the get go.  'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed 
tttsomething that we thought was true, that wasn't true.   So 
tttif it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some 
tttsuper trilogy rules.   One, you got a killer who's gonna be 
tttsuper human.  Stabbing him won't work, shooting him 
tttwon't work, basically in the third one, you gotta 
tttcryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him 
tttup.   Number two; anyone including the main character can 
tttdie.  This means you, Sid.  I'm sorry, it's the final 
tttchapter.  It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the 
ttttime this thing is through.  Number three; the past 
tttwill come back to bite you in the ass!  Whatever you 
tttthink you know about the past, forget it.  The past is 
tttnot at rest, any sins you think were committed in 
tttthe past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER 
tttFOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off 
tttby yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us 
tttanything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you, 
tttyou're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your 
tttback. So in closing, let me say good luck, God Speed, 
tttand for some of you, I'll see you soon, cause the rules 
tttsay, some of you ain't gonna make it.  I didn't, not

Silence. Sid reaches into her pocket book, draws out a Gravity Knife. She

the deck, sliding across the floor, deflecting the blow from the knife as the 
killer buries it into the sink counter. Sid races for the door, killer hot on 
her trail. SUDDENLY --

WHAM! The storage closet door flies open and a second GHOST comes charging 
out, knife gleaming. He dives for Sid. Sid takes up her knife, buries it in 
her attacker's shoulder. The GHOST goes reeling back into the closet. Sidney 
slams the door closed on him. She dives for the door knob when suddenly, the 
first ghost comes running back at her. She ducks as he swings his knife, 
burying it into the bathroom door. Sid bolts across the bathroom towards a 
tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling. Using the trash as a booster, 
she leaps up, slides open the window, and dives out, just as the deadly pair 
of attackers come back for more.

The door creaks open. Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey emerge from the darkness. 
Jennifer is gagging.

Milton's walking down the hallway. It's dark. Desolate. CAMERA tracks along 
the paisley velvet carpet as a phone rings O.S.

tttWell, at least not for you.


THE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS with a ping. A flash of silver and in an instant, 
John's throat is slashed open, spilling blood. His corpse thuds to the ground. 
A pair of gloved hands drag him into the elevator. A moments pause and then--

THE GHOST storms out, disappearing down the hall.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttHold on Gale, I'm a pro at this.

Dewey leans in, bumping his head with Gale's.

The two look at each other and smile. Dewey laughs sweetly. Gale reaches up, 
rubs his head.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>tttExcuse me Gale! What the hell

Gale and Dewey can't help gazing into each other's eyes. In an instant it

</b>ttt  (shaking it off)
tttLet's get this drawer open.
tttIf it's locked, there must be something

Dewey takes the butt of the flashlight, brings it down  hard on the locked 
drawer. The lock's smashed off.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>tttShit. That's gonna leave a mark.

Gale slides open the drawer, reaches in. She pulls up a manilla folder. Dewey 
shines the light on the folder as Gale opens it up and reads what's inside.

<b>ttttJENNIFER
</b>tttWhat? What'd you find?

Gale's eyes widen.

Dewey and Gale look up and scream as --

THE GHOST rushes out of the shadows. Jennifer bolts for the door. The GHOST 
jams his knife in her back. She lets out a blood curdling death scream, drops 
to the floor motionless. GALE and DEWEY share a terrified scream. The killer 
wipes his blade clean, lunges for them.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>ttt  (frantic)
tttGale run!

Dewey jumps in the killer's path. The killer winds back, cracks the base of 
the knife across Dewey's skull. Dewey drops to the floor unmoving.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttt  (screaming)
tttDewey!

CLANG! The Killer's blade glistens in the moonlight. He charges for Gale. Gale 
screams, races out of the office door, slamming it closed on the killer 
sending him flying onto his back.

<b>  CUT TO:

Gale races down the hallway, frantically trying every door she passes. All of 
them locked. She reaches the elevator, hits the "down" button.  The door opens 
with a ping. Gale unleashes a horrendous scream --

<b>MILTON --
</b>
--has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to 
gullet. His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet. 

GALE staggers away from the elevator, speechless. She screams again.

HER GHOSTLY ATTACKER is coming straight for her.

GALE fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator. He runs ahead, briefly, 
giving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face. Gale 
races out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked 
"stairs". She bolts through the door.

Kincaid spins around. Gale screams. The GHOST comes charging out of nowhere, 
slashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest. Kincaid drops onto the 
hood of his car, dead.

GALE pauses. She's screaming hysterically. The killer raises the knife 
menacingly.

Sidney sits in Kincaid's office flipping through the folder marked 'SIDNEY

basically a scrapbook of obsession. Sidney smirks. Kincaid has drawn little 
magic marker hearts around a picture of her. She's awakened from her daydream.

Wallace's keys rest on his desk. Sid ponders, takes them. She stands up when 
something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around. She pulls 
up a fully loaded handgun.

That's the ticket. She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit.

Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is 
startled out of fright.  Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production 
poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's 
in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open. Sid taps the 
holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness.

tttGo ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.

The killer hangs up. Sid pockets the phone. She walks past the MACHER GARAGE 
set. Instead of a foam TATUM body dangling from the doggy door, it's KINCAID'S 
CORPSE! Sidney flinches, covers her eyes. She walks on.

<b>INT.  BECKER HOUSE - SET - NIGHT

Sid steps through the living room of the BECKER set. It mirrors the house 
perfectly. Everything from the shattered patio door to the burnt Jiffy Pop is

Sid bolts through the shattered patio door out onto the backyard set. Seated 
before a heated in ground pool, tied to a patio chair, beaten and gagged, is 
DEWEY RIELLY. He's unconscious and almost appears at first glance like STEVEN 
ORTH from SCREAM. Sid's jaw drops. This can't be possible. She looks down at 
the phone.

<b>ttttDEWEY(O.S.)
</b>tttGood work Sid. 

Sid screams, dropping the phone out of fright. She turns around coming face to 
face with --

 The GHOST rushes Sid. She screams, takes off running. She bolts across the 
darkened set, running straight up the front porch of a mock-up of her own 
childhood home. She swings open the front door, slams it closed.

outside. However, what's inside utterly horrifies her. The walls, the 
furniture and the bed are splattered with blood. On the bed lies a corpse in a 
black rubber body bag (supposedly Maureen's body). The door buckles under the 
killer's blows. Gale and Sidney scream. They can't hold out much longer.

<b>ttttGALE

tttHe can't get us both!

A knife splinters through the door, inches from Gale's face. She screams.

Sid backs away, hysterical. She raises up the gun, fires into the door.  BLAM! 
BLAM! BLAM! Gale ducks out of the way. Silence.
The door ceases to move. AND THEN --

THE BODY BAG UNZIPS and the second GHOST emerges, knife in hand. The girls 
utter horrified screams. Sid raises up the gun, goes to fire when suddenly --

<b>BAM!
</b>
The bedroom door's kicked down and the other killer enters, grabbing Sid by 
her shoulders, batting the gun from her hands.

Sid screams, punches her attacker in the chest. He winces.

The second Ghost grabs Gale, holds the knife to her throat, stopping her in 
her tracks. Sid makes a beeline for the window, leaps through the glass.

<b>THE WINDOW SHATTERS.

Sid comes flying out onto the patio awning. She rolls over onto the astro-turf 
grass, momentarily motionless. And then she comes to. Her eyes flickering

embedding into Dewey's arm, launching him back through the doorway. Sidney 
screams. Dewey's unconscious again. The GHOST races for the open door. Sid 
screams, kicks it closed. Locking and bolting it again. A crash O.S. Sid turns 
around --

A BODY rolls down the staircase, covered in blood. It comes to a halt at 
Sidney's feet, an unmoving, rumpled figure.

tttthey laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney,
tttthey also set the stage for you! Introducing
tttto the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the
tttsurvivor! Sidney the star!

Roman continues stabbing himself. In the shoulder. In the side.In the leg. 
Bleeding and hazed, he hands the gore drenched knife to Angelina.

<b>ttttROMAN
</b>tttSee Sid, now comes the part where we get away
tttwith it! The part where we win! Cause face it
tttSidney, in this world, the bad guys win!

<b>ttttSIDNEY
</b>tttRoman knock it off! Do you people even know why you
tttkill people? You kill people cause you choose to and
tttnot because of any other fucking reason!

<b>ttttANGELINA
</b>ttt  (screaming)
tttRoman make her stop! Make her stop baby she's
tttfreaking me out!

<b>ttttROMAN
</b>ttt   (screaming)
tttGod damn it Sidney!

Roman lunges at Sidney. Sid screams, takes off through the kitchen. Gale rolls 
herself off the couch. Angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs. 

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttt  (coughing)
tttHey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain 
tttGale Weathers.

Gale pops off the handcuffs.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttt  (leaping up)
tttI know all the tricks!

Gale barrels into Angelina, tackling her into the coffee table before she has 
a chance to move. Angelina struggles to raise her knife.

<b>MEANWHILE --
</b>
<b>ROMAN,
</b>
--chases Sid into the foyer. She races past the spot where Dewey fell earlier. 
He's gone! Roman jumps at her. Sid disappears into another room.  THE CHASE 
continues.

<b>GALE AND ANGELINA,
</b>
Continue the fight. Gale's slamming Angelina's head against the hardwood 
floor. Angelina swipes, slashing Gale along the side, deeply. Gale screams, 
begins to crawl away. She kicks Angelina in the face. Angelina drops the 
knife. Gale stands up, begins to back away.

<b>SIDNEY--
</b>
Comes rounding into the foyer again. Roman's right behind her.

<b>SUDDENLY,
</b>
WHAM! The laundry room door swings open and the GHOST emerges, KNIFE in hand. 
He buries the knife deep into Roman's chest, sending him flying backwards. 
Sidney screams. The ghost stops in his tracks, pulling off his mask --

IT'S ONLY DEWEY. He can barely stand up. He's bleeding profusely from his 
wounds.

Dewey and Sid embrace.

<b>ttttSIDNEY
</b>tttDewey my God I thought you were dead.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>ttt Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.

<b>SCREAMING O.S.  
</b>
<b>ttttSIDNEY
</b><b>tttDEWEY! IT'S GALE!
</b>
Sidney and Dewey race into --

<b>LIVING ROOM --
</b>
Gale's got Angelina in a headlock, right beneath the TV UNIT.

<b>tttt GALE
</b>ttt  (screaming)
<b>tttTHIS IS FOR THE STARDOM I NEVER HAD!
</b><b>tttBITCH!
</b>
Gale releases, leaps up, she pushes the TV set down onto Angelina's head. 
Angelina screams, her body trembling from the electric shocks and high 
voltage.

SID and DEWEY stand in the doorway, breathless. Gale approaches them. She and 
Dewey embrace tightly.

ANGELINA's twitching corpse goes limp.

SIDNEY, spots a gun on the mantle. She grabs it, cocks it.

<b>--FOYER --
</b>
THE THREE SURVIVORS STEP INTO THE FOYER.  Sid looks down at Roman's corpse.

<b>tttttDEWEY
</b>tttWatch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always 
tttsuperhuman.

<b>ttttSIDNEY
</b>tttHe wasn't superhuman Dewey.
tttHe wasn't superhuman at all.

THEN A HORRIFYING SCREAM rips through the air.

ANGELINA comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried 
mess. Everyone screams, one epic last scream. Sid raises up the gun, fires, 
hitting Angelina dead center between the eyes, sending a splash of blood and 
brain matter onto the wall behind her.

<b>ttttGALE
</b><b>tttWHOA! HOLY SHIT IS THIS GONNA MAKE A GOOD BOOK!
</b>
Sid turns to Roman's lifeless body.

<b>POV LOOKING UP ON SID TURNING THE GUN DOWN ON US --
</b>
<b>ttttSIDNEY
</b>ttt  (pissed)
tttThis shit is really getting repetitive,
tttyou know?

SID scrunches up her face in anger, pulls the trigger. BLAM! A CLEAN PERFECT 
<b>SHOT TO ROMAN'S HEAD.
</b>
Sid drops the gun, walks off set.

<b>   CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIOS - THE NEXT MORNING
</b>
The police, fire, and ems are all on the scene of the crime.

Dewey's wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance.

<b>INT.  AMBULANCE 
</b>
Gale's right beside him on a stretcher. She leans over, takes his hand.

<b>ttttDEWEY
</b>tttGale, I know this is a bad time and all but what 
tttif we try it out again.
tttThe whole relationship thing.

<b>ttttGALE
</b>ttt  (smiles)
tttSure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.

Dewey smiles. The two kiss feverishly.

<b> CUT TO:
</b>
WALLACE exiting his car. He surveys the damage. Sid passes him.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE WALLACE
</b>tttJesus Christ what happened?
tttI leave for two seconds to take my
tttkid to the doctor, I come back and it's
tttthe fucking WILD BUNCH.

<b>ttttSIDNEY
</b>tttIt was just something that's been itching 
tttto be completed for the past four years.

<b>ttttDETECTIVE WALLACE
</b>tttI guess so.

<b>ttttSIDNEY
</b>tttTake care Detective. Give my regards
tttto the wife and kids.

Wallace nods his thanks as Sidney walks off through the studio gates, the sun 
rising overhead, as calm and as casually as if nothing's happened. SLOWLY, we 
crane up to an aerial looking down upon HOLLYWOOD. ANOTHER DAY IS BEGINNING. 
<b>AND THIS IS THE PERFECT END FOR A TRILOGY.
</b>
<b>CUT TO BLACK
</b>
<b>THE END
