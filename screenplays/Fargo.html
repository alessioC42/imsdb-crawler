</b>                              a screenplay by
                                Ethan Coen
                                    and
                                 Joel Coen

tThe following text fades in over black:

tThis is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place
tin Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names
thave been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been
ttold exactly as it occured.

<b>tFLARE TO WHITE
</b>
<b>tFADE IN FROM WHITE
</b>
tSlowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white
tparticles wave over a white background.  A snowfall.

tA car bursts through the curtain of snow.

tThe car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car,
ta brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales
tsticker showing in its rear window.

tAs the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft,
tthe title of the film fades in.

<b>ttttFARGO
</b>
tGreen highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD,
tMINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities
tdiverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another
tjust after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412.

tThe car pulls into a Rodeway Inn.

<b>tHOTEL LOBBY
</b>
tA man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch,
tgoes to the reception desk.  The clerk is an older woman.

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttAnd how are you today, sir?

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttReal good now.  I'm checking in
tt- Mr. Anderson.

tThe man prints "Jerry Lundega" onto a registration card,
tthen hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print
t"Anderson."

tAs she types into a computer:

<b>ttttCLERK
</b>ttOkay, Mr. Anderson, and you're
ttstill planning on staying with
ttus just the night, then?

<b>ttttANDERSON
</b>ttYou bet.

<b>tHOTEL ROOM
</b>
tThe man turns on the TV, which shows the local evening news.

<b>ttttNEWS ANCHOR
</b>tt- whether they will go to summer
ttcamp at all.  Katie Jensen has
ttmore.

<b>ttttKATIE
</b>ttIt was supposed to be a project
ttfunded by the city council;  it
ttwas supposed to benefit those
ttFargo-Moorehead children who
ttwould otherwise not be able to
ttafford to attend a lakeshore
ttsummer camp.  But nobody consulted
ttcity controller Stu Jacobson...

<b>tCHAIN RESTAURANT
</b>
tAnderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner.  Muzak
tplays.  A middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of
tregular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other.

<b>ttttWAITRESS
</b>ttCan I warm that up for ya there?

<b>ttttANDERSON
</b>ttYou bet.

tThe man looks at his watch.

<b>tTHROUGH A WINDSHIELD
</b>
tWe are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story
tbrick building.  Broken neon at the top of the building
tidentifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern.  A troll, also in
tneon, holds a champagne glass aloft.

<b>tINSIDE
</b>
tThe bar is downscale even for this town.  Country music
tplays on the jukebox.

tTwo men are seated in a booth at the back.  One is short,
tslight, youngish.  The other man is somewhat older, and
tdour.  The table in front of them is littered with empty
tlong-neck beer bottles.  The ashtray is full.

tAnderson approaches.

<b>ttttANDERSON
</b>ttI'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -

<b>ttttYOUNGER MAN
</b>ttYou're Jerry Lundegaard?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, Shep Proudfoot said -

<b>ttttYOUNGER MAN
</b>ttShep said you'd be here at 7:30.
ttWhat gives, man?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttShep said 8:30.

<b>ttttYOUNGER MAN
</b>ttWe been sitting here an hour.
ttI've peed three times already.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttI'm sure sorry.  I - Shep told
ttme 8:30.  It was a mix-up, I
ttguess.

<b>ttttYOUNGER MAN
</b>ttYa got the car?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, you bet.  It's in the lot
ttthere.  Brand-new burnt umber
ttCiera.

<b>ttttYOUNGER MAN
</b>ttYeah, okay.  Well, siddown then.
ttI'm Carl Showalter and this is
ttmy associate Gaear Grimsrud.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, how ya doin'.  So, uh, we
ttall set on this thing, then?

<b>ttttYOUNGER MAN
</b>ttSure, Jerry, we're all set.  Why
ttwouldn't we be?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, no, I'm sure you are.  Shep
ttvouched for you and all.  I got
ttevery confidence in you fellas.

tThey stare at him.  An awkward beat.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>tt...  So I guess that's it, then.
ttHere's the keys -

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttNo, that's not it, Jerry.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttHuh?

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttThe new vehicle, plus forty
ttthousand dollars.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, but the deal was, the car
ttfirst, see, then the forty
ttthousand, like as if it was the
ttransom.  I thought Shep told you -

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttShep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttWell, okay, it's -

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttExcept that you were gonna be
tthere at 7:30.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttYeah, you already said that.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah.  But it's not a whole pay-
ttin-advance deal.  I give you a
ttbrand-new vehicle in advance and -

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttI'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttOkay.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttI'm not gonna sit here and debate.
ttI will say this though:  what Shep
tttold us didn't make a whole lot
ttof sense.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttOh, no, it's real sound.  It's
ttall worked out.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttYou want your own wife kidnapped?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah.

tCarl Stares.  Jerry looks blankly back.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt...  You - my point is, you pay
ttthe ransom - what eighty thousand
ttbucks? -  I mean, you give us
tthalf the ransom, forty thousand,
ttyou keep half.  It's like robbing
ttPeter to play Paul, it doesn't
ttmake any -

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttOkay, it's - see, it's not me
ttpayin' the ransom.  The thing is,
ttmy wife, she's wealthy - her dad,
tthe's real well off.  Now, I'm in
tta bit of trouble -

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttWhat kind of trouble are you in,
ttJerry?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttWell, that's, that's, I'm not go
ttinta, inta - see, I just need
ttmoney.  Now, her dad's real
ttwealthy -

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttSo why don't you just ask him
ttfor the money?

tGrimsrud, the dour man who has not yet spoken, now softly
tputs in with a Swedish-accented voice:

<b>ttttGRIMSRUD
</b>ttOr your fucking wife, you know.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttOr your fucking wife, Jerry.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttWell, it's all just part of this -
ttthey don't know I need it, see.
ttOkay, so there's that.  And even
ttif they did, I wouldn't get it.
ttSo there's that on top, then.  See,
ttthese're personal matters.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttPersonal matters.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah.  Personal matters that
ttneedn't, uh -

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttOkay, Jerry.  You're tasking us
ttto perform this mission, but you,
ttyou won't, uh, you won't - aw,
ttfuck it, let's take a look at
ttthat Ciera.

<b>tMINNEAPOLIS SUBURBAN HOUSE
</b>
tJerry enters through the kitchen door, in a parka and a red
tplaid Elmer Fudd hat.  He stamps snow off his feet.  He is
tcarrying a bag of groceries which he deposits on the kitchen
tcounter.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttHon?  Got the growshries.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttThank you, hon.  How's Fargo?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, real good.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDad's here.

<b>tDEN
</b>
tJerry enters, pulling off his plaid cap.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttHow ya doin', Wade?

tWade Gustafson is mid-sixtyish, vigorous, with a full head
tof gray hair.  His eyes remain fixed on the TV.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYah, pretty good.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttWhatcha watchin' there?

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttNorstars.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>tt...  Who they playin'?

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttOOOoooh!

tHis reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.

<b>tKITCHEN
</b>
tJerry walks back in, taking off his coat.  His wife is
tputting on an apron.  Jerry nods toward the living room.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttIs he stayin' for supper, then?

<b>ttttWIFE
</b>ttYah, I think so...  Dad, are you
ttstayin' for supper?

<b>ttttWADE

ttYah.

<b>tDINING ROOM

</b>ttUh-huh.  Goin' out.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttBack at 9:30.

<b>ttttSCOTTY
</b>ttOkay.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttHe just ate.  And he didn't finish.
ttHe's going to McDonald's instead
ttof finishing here?

<b>ttttWIFE
</b>ttHe sees his friends there.  It's

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttIt's okay?  McDonald's?  What do
ttyou think they do there?  They
ttdon't drink milkshakes, I assure
ttyou!

<b>ttttWIFE
</b>ttIt's okay, Dad.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttWade, have ya had a chance to
ttthink about, uh, that deal I was
tttalkin' about, those forty acres
ttthere on Wayzata?

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYou told me about it.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, you said you'd have a think
ttabout it.  I understand it's a
ttlot of money -

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttA heck of a lot.  What'd you
ttsay you were gonna put there?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttA lot.  It's a limited -

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttI know it's a lot.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttI mean a parking lot.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttYah, well, seven hundred and
ttfifty thousand dollars is a lot
tt- ha ha ha!

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, well, it's a chunk, but -

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttI thought you were gonna show
ttit to Stan Grossman.  He passes
tton this stuff before it gets
ttkicked up to me.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttWell, you know Stan'll say no
ttdice.  That's why you pay him.
ttI'm asking you here, Wade.  This
ttcould work out real good for me
ttand Jean and Scotty -

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttJean and Scotty never have to
ttworry.

<b>tWHITE
</b>
tA black like curls through the white.  Twisting perspective
tshows that it is an aerial shot of a two-lane highway,
tbordered by snowfields.  The highway carries one moving car.

<b>tINT. CAR
</b>
tCarl Showalter is driving.  Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly
tout.

tAfter a long beat:

<b>ttttGRIMSRUD
</b>ttWhere is Pancakes Hause?

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttGRIMSRUD
</b>ttWe stop at Pancakes Hause.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttWhat're you, nuts?  We had
ttpancakes for breakfast.  I gotta
ttgo somewhere I can get a shot
ttand a beer - and a steak maybe.
ttNot more fuckin' pancakes.  Come
tton.

tGrimsrud gives him a sour look.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt...  Come on, man.  Okay, here's
ttan idea.  We'll stop outside of
ttBrainerd.  I know a place there
ttwe can get laid.  Wuddya think?

</b>ttI'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.

ttwe'll get laid.  Wuddya think?

<b>tGUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE
</b>
tJerry is sitting in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just
toff the showroom floor.  On the other side of his desk sit
tan irate customer and his wife.

</b>ttWe sat here right in this room and

tThe couple watch him go to a nearby cubicle.

teating lunch as he watches a hockey game on a small portable

<b>tCLOSE ON TELEVISION
</b>
tA morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a
tkitchen set.

<b>ttttHOST
</b>ttSo I seperate the - how the heck
ttdo I get the egg out of the shell
ttwithout breaking it?

tJean Lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of
tcoffee, watching the television.

<b>ttttHOSTESS
</b>ttYou just prick a little hole in
ttthe end and blow!

tJean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio
taudience.  She hears something else - a faint scraping sound
t- and looks up.

<b>ttttHOST
</b>ttOkay, here goes nothing.

tThe scraping sound persists.  Jean sets down her coffee cup
tand rises.

tFrom the studio audience:

<b>ttttAUDIENCE
</b>ttAwoooo!

<b>tKITCHEN
</b>
tWe track toward the back door.  A curtain is stretched tight
tacross its window.

tJean pulls the curtain back.  Bright sunlight amplified by
tsnow floods in.

tA man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock.

tJean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into -

t- a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house.

tWe hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed.

tThe tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jean's wrist.

tShe screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps
ther gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites
tdown hard.

tHe drops her wrist.  As Carl enters, she races up the
tstairs.

<b>ttttGRIMSRUD
</b>ttUnguent.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttHuh?

tGrimsurd looks at his thumb.

<b>ttttGRIMSRUD
</b>ttI need ... unguent.

<b>tUPSTAIRS BEDROOM
</b>
tAs the two men enter, a door at the far side is slamming
tshut.  A cord snakes in under the door.

<b>tMASTER BATHROOM
</b>
tJean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess
tphone.

tThe phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile
tfloor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its
tcord ripped free.

tWith a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.

<b>tBEDROOM
</b>
tGrimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door
tand frame, and is working it.

<b>tBATHROOM
</b>
tJean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it
topen.  Snow that had drifted against the window sifts
tlightly in.  Jean steps up onto the toilet.

tThe door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.

tJean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to
tthe tank.

tThe groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob
tsplintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor.

tThe door swings open.

tGrimsrud and Carl enter.

<b>tTHEIR POV
</b>
tRoom empty, window open.

tCarl strides to the window and hoists himself out.

tGrimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps
taside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent.

tHe finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing
tsomething in the mirror.

tThe shower curtain is drawn around the tub.

tHe steps toward it.

tAs he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated
tby thrashing limbs.

tJean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its
trings and stumbles out into the bedroom.  Grimsrud follows.

<b>tBEDROOM
</b>
tJean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain
tbut awkwardly trying to push it off.

<b>tUPSTAIRS LANDING
</b>
tStill thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,
ttrips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the
tstairs.

tGrimsrud trots down after her.

ttindependently.

<b>tPARKING LOT
</b>
tWe are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.
tJerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly
tout at his sides, his breath vaporizing.  He goes to his
tcar, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper
tand starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice
tthat has developed on his windshield.

tThe scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air.

tJerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the
twindshield and the hood of his car.

tThe tantrum passes.  Jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing
tin particular.

tScrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the
twindshield.

<b>tFRONT DOOR
</b>
tA beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock.

tThe door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about,
tholding a sack of groceries.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttHon?

tHe shuts the door.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>tt...  Got the growshries...

tHe has already seen the shower curtain on the floor.  He
tfrowns, pokes at it with his foot.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>tt...  Hon?

<b>tUPSTAIRS BATHROOM
</b>
tJerry walks in.  He sets the groceries down on the toilet
ttank.

tHe looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts
tin.  He shuts it.

tHe picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink,
tfrowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.

tHe looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings.

<b>tFOYER
</b>
tOnce again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain.

tFrom another room:

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I.

tThen, slightly more agitated.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>tt...  Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's

tBeat.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>tt...  Wade, it's Jerry, I - we

tBeat.

<b>tLIVING ROOM
</b>
tJerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a
ttelephone.

tAfter a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in
ta number.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>tt...  Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.

<b>tBLACK
</b>
tHold in black.

tA slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large
tpaper-mache figure into frame.  It is a flannel-shirt
twoodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder.  As
twe hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing
ttilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a
tpedestal.

tA sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal:
<b>tWELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN.
</b>
tThe headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the
tbackground.  The two-lane highway is otherwise empty.

<b>tINT. CAR
</b>
tCarl drives.  Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window.
tFrom the back seat we hear whimpering.

tGrimsrud turns to look.

tJean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a
ttarpaulin.

<b>ttttGRIMSRUD
</b>ttShut the fuck up or I'll throw
ttyou back in the trunk, you know.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttGeez.  That's more'n I've heard
ttyou say all week.

tGrimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window.

tAt a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear
twindow.  Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on
this gumballs.

tCarl eases the car onto the shoulder.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttAh, shit, the tags...

tGrimsrud looks at him.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt...  It's just the tags.  I never
ttput my tags on the car.  Don't
ttworry, I'll take care of this.

tHe looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on
tthe gravel shoulder.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt...  Let's keep still back there,
ttlady, or we're gonna have to, ya
ttknow, to shoot ya.

tGrimsrud stares at Carl.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt...  Hey!  I'll take care of this!

tBoth cars have stopped.  Carl looks up at the rear-view
tmirror.

tThe trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them,
twriting in his citation book.

tCarl watches.

tWe hear the trooper's door open.

tThe trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly
ton top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night
tair.

tCarl opens his window as the trooper draws up.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttHow can I help you, officer?

tThe trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time.

tGrimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.

tFinally:

<b>ttttTROOPER
</b>ttThis is a new car, then, sir?

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttIt certainly is, officer.  Still
ttgot that smell!

<b>ttttTROOPER
</b>ttYou're required to display
tttemporary tags, either in the
ttplate area or taped inside the
ttback window.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttCertainly -

<b>ttttTROOPER
</b>ttCan I see your license and
ttregistration please?

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttCertainly.

tHe reaches for his wallet.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt...  I was gonna tape up the
tttemporary tag, ya know, to be
ttin full compliance, but it, uh,
ttit, uh ... must a slipped my
ttmind...

tHe extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty-
tdollar bill protruding from it.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt...  So maybe the best thing
ttwould be to take care of that,
ttright here in Brainerd.

<b>ttttTROOPER
</b>ttWhat's this, sir?

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttThat's my license and regis-
tttration.  I wanna be in
ttcompliance.

tHe forces a laugh.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt...  I was just thinking I could
tttake care of it right here.  In
ttBrainerd.

tThe policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold
tand hands the billfold back into the car.

<b>ttttTROOPER
</b>ttPut that back in your pocket,
ttplease.

tCarl's nervous smile fades.

<b>ttttTROOPER
</b>tt...  And step out of the car,
ttplease, sir.

tGrimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.

tThere is a whimpering sound.

tThe policeman hesitates.

tAnother sound.

tThe policeman leans forward into the car, listening.

tGrimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair
tand slams his head down onto the car door.

tThe policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and
tthrows an arm for balance against the outside of the car.

tWith his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment.  He
tbrings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG -
tinto the back of the trooper's head.

tJean screams.

<b>ttttGRIMSRUD
</b>ttShut up.

tHe releases the policeman.

tThe policeman's head slides out the window and his body
tflops back onto the street.

tCarl looks out at the cop in the road.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttt(softly)
ttWhoa...  Whoa, Daddy.

tGrimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails
tit out the open window.

<b>ttttGRIMSRUD
</b>ttYou'll take care of it.  Boy, you
ttare smooth smooth, you know.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttWhoa, Daddy.

tJean, for some reason, screams again.  Then stops.

<b>ttttGRIMSRUD
</b>ttClear him off the road.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttYeah.

tHe gets out.

<b>tEXT. ROAD

tHeadlights appear:  an oncoming car.

tGrimsrud notices.

<b>tEXT. ROAD
</b>
tThe car approaches, slowing.

tCarl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen
tin the headlights.

tThe car accelerates and roars past and away.  We just make
tout the silhouettes of two occupants in front.

<b>tINT. CIERA
</b>
tGrimsrud slides into the driver's seat.  He squeals into a U-
tturn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin.

tSmall red tail lights fishtail up ahead.  The pursued car
tchurns up fine snow.

tGrimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in
this ashtray.  We hear the churning of the car wheels and the
tpinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside.

tIn the back seat, Jean starts screaming.

tGrimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights.

tHe fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.

tThe red tail lights ahead start to turn.  With a distant
tcrunching sound, they disappear.

tThe headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn.

tGrimsrud frowns and slows.

tHis headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled
taround a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn.

tGrimsrud brakes.

tJean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell.

tGrimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his
tdoor and gets out.

<b>tEXT. ROAD
</b>
tThe wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield
tabutting the highway.  A young man in a down parka is
tlimping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car.

tGrimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy.  He
traises his gun and fires.

tWith a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back
tand he pitches into the snow.

tGrimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open
tdoor.

tA young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage,
tinjured.

tSnow swirls in the headlights of the wreck.

tGrimsrud raises his gun and fires.

<b>tAN OIL PAINTING

troom in which it hangs is dark.  We hear off-screen snoring.

tWe track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half-
tcompleted oil of a grey mallard.

tThe continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping.  The
tman, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied.  His
tmouth is agape.  He snores.  His arms are flung over a woman
tin her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not
tsnoring.

tWe hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and
tsnoring.

tThe phone rings.

tThe woman stirs.

<b>ttttWOMAN

tShe reaches for the phone.

tTwo police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of
tthe road, a pair of men inside each car.

tThe first car's driver door opens and a figure in a parka
temerges, holding two styrofoam cups.  His partner leans
tacross the seat to close the door after him.

tThe reverse shows Marge approaching from her own squad car.

</b>ttI'm fine - it's just morning
ttsickness.

tShe gets up, sweeping snow from her knees.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  Well, that passed.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYah?

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttYah.  Now I'm hungry again.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYou had breakfast yet, Margie?

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttOh, yah.  Norm made some eggs.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYah?  Well, what now, d'ya think?

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttLet's go take a look at that
tttrooper.

<b>tBY THE STATE TROOPER'S CAR
</b>
tMarge's prowler is parked nearby.

tMarge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch,
tagain looking at footprints in the snow.  She calls up to
tthe road:

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttThere's two of 'em, Lou!

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYah?

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttYah, this guy's smaller than
tthis buddy.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttOh, yah?

<b>tDOWN IN THE DITCH
</b>
tIn the foreground is the head of the state trooper, facing
tus.  Peering at it from behind, still on her hands and
tknees, is Marge.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttFor Pete's sake.

tShe gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out
tof the ditch.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttHow's it look, Marge?

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttWell, he's got his gun on his hip
ttthere, and he looks like a nice
ttenough guy.  It's a real shame.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYah.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttYou haven't monkeyed with his car
ttthere, have ya?

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttNo way.

tShe is looking at the prowler, which still idles on the
tshoulder.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttSomebody shut his lights.  I guess
ttthe little guy sat in there, waitin'
ttfor his buddy t'come back.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYah, woulda been cold out here.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttHeck, yah.  Ya think, is Dave open
ttyet?

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYou don't think he's mixed up in -

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttNo, no, I just wanna get Norm some
ttnight crawlers.

<b>tINT. PROWLER
</b>
tMarge is driving; Lou sits next to her.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttYou look in his citation book?

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYah...

tHe looks at his notebook.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>tt...  Last vehicle he wrote in
ttwas a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.
ttUnder the plate number he put
ttDLR - I figure they stopped him
ttor shot him before he could finish
ttfillin' out the tag number.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttUh-huh.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttSo I got the state lookin' for a
ttCiera with a tag startin' DLR.
ttThey don't got no match yet.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttI'm not sure I agree with you a
tthunnert percent on your policework,
ttthere, Lou.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYah?

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttYah, I think that vehicle there
ttprobly had dealer plates.  DLR?

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttOh...

tLou gazes out the window, thinking.

<b>ttttLOU
</b>tt...  Geez.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttYah.  Say, Lou, ya hear the one
ttabout the guy who couldn't afford
ttpersonalized plates, so he went
ttand changed his name to J2L 4685?

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYah, that's a good one.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttYah.

<b>tTHE ROAD
</b>
tThe police car enters with a whoosh and hums down a straight-
truled empty highway, cutting a landscape of flat and perfect
twhite.

<b>tEMBERS FAMILY RESTAURANT
</b>
tJerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit in a booth, sipping
tcoffee.  Outside the window, snow falls from a gunmetal sky.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>tt-  All's I know is, ya got a
ttproblem, ya call a professional!

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttNo!  They said no cops!  They were
ttdarned clear on that, Wade!  They

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttWell -

</b>ttWe gotta protect Jean.  These -

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttAh, dammit!

<b>ttttSTAN
</b>ttI'm tellin' ya.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttWell...  Why don't we...

tHe saws a finger under his nose.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>tt...  Stan, I'm thinkin' we should
ttoffer 'em half a million.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttNow come on here, no way, Wade!
ttNo way!

<b>ttttSTAN
</b>ttWe're not horse-trading here, Wade,
ttwe just gotta bite the bullet on

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah!

<b>ttttSTAN
</b>ttWhat's the next step here, Jerry?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttThey're gonna call, give me
ttinstructions for a drop.  I'm
ttsupposed to have the money ready
tttomorrow.

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttDammit!

<b>tTHE CASHIER
</b>
tShe rings up two dollars forty.

<b>ttttCASHIER
</b>ttHow was everything today?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, real good now.

<b>tPARKING LOT
</b>
tSnow continues to fall.  Jerry and Stan stand bundled in
ttheir parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles.
tWade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for
tStan.

<b>ttttSTAN
</b>ttOkay.  We'll get the money together.
ttDon't worry about it, Jerry.  Now,
ttd'you want anyone at home, with you,
ttuntil they call?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttNo, I - they don't want - they're
ttjust s'posed to be dealin' with
ttme, they were real clear.

<b>ttttSTAN
</b>ttYah.

tJerry pounds his mittened hands together against the cold.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYa know, they said no one listenin'
ttin, they'll be watchin', ya know.
ttMaybe it's all bull, but like you
ttsaid, Stan, they're callin' the
ttshots.

<b>ttttSTAN
</b>ttOkay.  And Scotty, is he gonna
ttbe all right?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttYah, geez, Scotty.  I'll go talk
ttto him.

tThere is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the
tLincoln.

<b>ttttSTAN
</b>ttWe'll call.

tThe Lincoln spits snow as it grinds out of the lot and
tfishtails out onto the boulevard.

<b>tSCOTTY'S BEDROOM
</b>
tScotty lies on the bed, weeping.  Jerry enters and perches
tuncomfortably on the edge of his bed.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>tt...  How ya doin' there, Scotty?

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttDad!  What're they doing?  Wuddya
ttthink they're doin' with Mom?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttIt's okay, Scotty.  They're not
ttgonna want to hurt her any.
ttThese men, they just want money,

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttWhat if - what if sumpn goes wrong?

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttNo, no, nothin's goin' wrong here.
ttGrandad and I, we're - we're makin'
ttsure this gets handled right.

tScott snorfles and sits up.

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttDad, I really think we should call
ttthe cops.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttNo!  We can't let anyone know about
ttthis thing!  We gotta play ball with

tthe'll tell ya the same thing!

<b>ttttSCOTT
</b>ttYeah, but -

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttWe're gonna get Mom back for ya, but
ttwe gotta play ball.  Ya know, that's
ttthe deal.  Now if Lorraine calls, or
ttSylvia, you just say that Mom is in
ttFlorida with Pearl and Marty...

tScotty starts to weep again.  Jerry stares down at his lap.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>tt...  That's the best we can do here.

<b>tEXT. CABIN
</b>
tIt is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white.  A brown Ciera
twith dealer plates is pulling into the drive.

tGrimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out
tof the driver's.  Grimsrud opens the back door and, with an
tarm on her elbow, helps Jean out.  She has her hands tied
tbehind her and a black hood over her head.

tWith a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and
tlurches away across the front lawn.  Grimsrud moves to
tretrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his
tshoulder.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttHold it.

tThey both look out at the front lawn, Grimsrud
texpressionless, Carl smiling.

tWith muffled cries, the hooded woman lurches across the
tunbroken snow, staggering this way and that, stumbling on
tthe uneven terrain.

tShe stops, stands still, her hooded head swaying.

tShe lurches out in an arbitrary direction.  Going downhill,
tshe reels, staggers, and falls face-first into the snow,
tweeping.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttHa ha ha ha ha ha!  Jesus!

tGrimsrud, still expressionless, breaks away from Carl's
trestraining hand to retrieve her.

<b>tBRAINERD POLICE HEADQUARTERS
</b>
tWe track behind Marge as she makes her way across the floor,
tgreeting various officers.  She holds a small half-full
tpaper sack.

tBeyond her we see a small glassed-in cublcle.  Norm sits at
tthe desk inside with a box lunch spread out in front of him.
tThere is lettering on the cubicle's glass door:  BRAINERD
<b>tPD. CHIEF GUNDERSON.
</b>
tMarge enters and sits behind the desk, detaching her walkie-
ttalkie from her utility belt to accomodate the seat.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttHiya, hon.

tShe slides the paper sack toward him.

<b>ttttNORM
</b>ttBrought ya some lunch, Margie.
ttWhat're those, night crawlers?

</b>ttThey're good, Norm, but you're

tHe leans over and kisses her.

</b>ttHiya, Norm, how's the paintin'

</b>ttNot too bad.  You know.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttHow we doin' on that vehicle?

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttNo motels registered any tan Ciera
ttlast night.  But the night before,
tttwo men checked into the Blue Ox
ttregistering a Ciera and leavin' the
tttag space blank.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttGeez, that's a good lead.  The
ttBlue Ox, that's that trucker's

<b>ttttLOU
</b>ttYah.  Owner was on the desk then,

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttOh, yah?

<b>tEXT. STRIPPER CLUB
</b>
tMarge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot.  Snow
tdrifts down.

<b>tINT. STRIPPER CLUB
</b>
tMarge sits talking with two young women at one end of an
televated dance platform.  The club, not yet open for
tbusiness, is deserted.

</b>ttWhere you girls from?

</b>ttI dunno.  Just funny-looking.

</b>ttCan you be any more specific?

<b>ttttHOOKER ONE

ttMore'n most people even.

tsits in the drive.

<b>tINT. CABIN
</b>
tWe track in on Jean Lundegaard, who sits tied in a chair
twith the black hood still over her head.  As we track in, we
thear inarticulate cursing, intermittent banging and loud
tstatic.

tWe track in on Gaear Grimsrud, who sits smoking a cigarette
tand expressionlessly gazing offscreen.

tWe track in on Carl Showalter, who stands over an old black-
tand-white television.  It plays nothing but snow.  Carl is
tbanging on it as he mutters:

</b>tt...days ... be here for days with

twe hear insects chirring.

tAfter a long beat, silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs,
tstill looking at the set:

<b>ttttWADE
</b>ttUnghh ... oh, geez...

tHe is on the pavement, clutching at his gut.  Snow swirls.

tHe bends down next to Wade to pick up the briefcase.

tWade brings out his gun and fires at Carl's head, close by.

<b>ttttJERRY
</b>ttOh!  Oh, geez!

tHe bends down, picks Wade up by the armpits and drags him
tover to the back of the Cadillac.  He drops Wade's body,
twalks to the driver's side of the car, pulls the keys and
twalks back to pop the trunk.  He wrestles Wade's body into

</b>
tIt is a starky sunny day.  We are cruising down a street of
thumble lookalike houses.

tWe pan right as we draw toward one house in particular.  In
tits driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow.  He
tnotices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave.

tThe driver is Gary, the Brainderd police officer.  He gives
ta finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over.

<b>tOUTSIDE
</b>
tGary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel
tin the snow.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttHow ya doin'?

<b>ttttGARY
</b>ttMr. Mohra?

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttYah.

<b>ttttGARY
</b>ttOfficer Olson.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttYah, right-o.

tThe two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and
twithout standing particularly close.  They stand stiffly,
tarms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their
tparka hoods.  Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head
tdrawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face
tfrom protruding into the cold.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>tt...  So, I'm tendin' bar there at
ttEcklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday
ttand this little guy's drinkin'
ttand he says, 'So where can a guy

ttdown there at the lake.'  And I
ttsays, 'What kinda action?' and he
ttsays, 'Woman action, what do I
ttlook like,'  And I says 'Well,
ttwhat do I look like, I don't
ttarrange that kinda thing,' and he
ttsays, 'I'm goin' crazy out there

<b>ttttGARY

<b>ttttGARY
</b>ttI unnerstand.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttAnd then he calls me a jerk and
ttsays the last guy who thought he
ttwas a jerk was dead now.  So I
ttdon't say nothin' and he says, 'What

ttsays, 'Well, that don't sound like

</b>ttYa got that right.

<b>ttttGARY
</b>ttWhite Bear Lake?

</b>ttWell, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's

</b>ttOh sure.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttSo, ya know, he's drinkin', so I
ttdon't think a whole great deal of

ttI should call it in, so I called
ttit in.  End a story.

<b>ttttGARY
</b>ttWhat'd this guy look like anyways?

</b>ttOh, he was a little guy, kinda

</b>ttJust a general way.

<b>ttttGARY

<b>tCLOSE ON CARL SHOWALTER
</b>
tIn his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to
this mangled jaw.  He is staring down at something in the
tfront seat next to him.

tHis other hand holds open the briefcase.  It has money
tinside - a lot of money.

tCarl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and
tlooks at it.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt...  Mmmnphh.

tHe paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling
tfor the amount.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>tt...  Jeshush Shrist...  Jeshush
ttfuchem Shrist!

tExcited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto
tthe back seat.

tHe starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer
tpressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to
this skin by clotted blood.

tHe pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow
tagain.

tHe carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it
tremains adhering to his jaw.

<b>tEXT. CAR
</b>
tIt is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road.  THe
tdoor opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase.

tHe slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the
tembankment to a barbed-wire fence.  He kneels at one of the
tfence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare
thands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up.

tHe stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his
tred, frozen hands.

tHe looks to the right.

tA regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
tagainst unblemished white.

tHe looks to the left.

tA regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
tagainst unblemished white.

tHe looks at the fence post in front of him.

<b>ttttCARL
</b>ttMmmphh...

tHe looks about the snowy vastness for a marker.  Finding
tnone, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to
tscar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up
tagainst the post.

tHe bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it
tagainst his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car.

tThere is a framed picture facing away from her on the

tIn her cruiser, on her two-way.  Through it we hear Lou's
tvoice, heavily filtered:

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttHis wife.  This guy says she was
ttkidnapped last Wednesday.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttThe day of our homicides.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYah.

tMarge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through
tthe bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs
tdown to a large frozen lake.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttAnd this guy is...

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttLundegaard's father-in-law's
ttaccountant.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttGustafson's accountant.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYah.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttBut we still haven't found Gustafson.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttt(crackle)
tt-  looking.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttSorry - didn't copy.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttStill missing.  We're looking.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttCopy.  And Lundegaard too.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYah.  Where are ya, Margie?

tWe hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as
tof a chainsaw or lawnmower.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttOh, I'm almost back - I'm driving
ttaround Moose Lake.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttOh.  Gary's loudmouth.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttYah, the loudmouth.  So the whole
ttstate has it, Lundegaard and
ttGustafson?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYah, it's over the wire, it's
tteverywhere, they'll find 'em.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttCopy.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWe've got a -

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttThere's the car!  There's the car!

tWe are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down
tto a cabin.  Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWhose car?

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttMy car!  My car!  Tan Ciera!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttDon't go in!  Wait for back-up!

tMarge is straining to look.  The power-tool noise is louder
there but still muffled, its source not yet visible.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tt...  Chief Gunderson?

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttCopy.  Yah, send me back-up!

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYes, ma'am.  Are we the closest PD?

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttYah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich
ttand he takes February off to go to
ttBoundary Waters.

<b>tROAD EXTERIOR
</b>
tMarge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin.
tShe gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-
tlined hood.

tFor a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of
tthe power tool.  Then, with one curved arm half pressing
tagainst, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly
tsteps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the
ttrees angling toward the cabin and the source of the
tgrinding noise.

tShe slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her
tdownhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the
tnext.

tThe roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree,
ther breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squints
tdown toward the cabin's back lot.

tA tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted
tjacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a
tlarge power tool which his body blocks from view.

tMarge advances.

tThe man is forcing downward something which engages the
troaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.

tThe man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the
tcold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams
tas he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a
tshod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.

tThe roar is very loud.

tMarge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.

tGrimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we
tcan now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.

tMarge's eyes shift.

tA large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.

tGrimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends
tdown out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.
tHe uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.

tMarge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward
tGrimsrud, who is still turned away.

tGrimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

tMarge closes in, grimacing.

tGrimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log
tthat pushes down into the machine.

tThe dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of
tCarl Showalter's body.

tMarge has drawn to within twenty yards.  When she bellows it
tsounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the
troar of the power tool.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttStop!  Police!  Turn around and
tthands up!

tStartled, Grimsrud scowls.  He turns to face her.

tHe stares.

tMarge bellows again:

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  Hands up!

tConscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her
tshoulder the armpatch insignia.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  Police!

tGrimsrud stares.

tWith a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at
tMarge and then starts running away.

tMarge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.

tNo need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands
tin the snow several feet short of her.

tGrimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep
tsnow.

tBehind him:

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  Halt!

tShe fires in the air.

tShe lowers the gun and carefully sighs.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  Halt!

tShe fires.

tGrimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss.

tMarge sights again.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  Halt!

tShe fires again.

tGrimsrud pitches forward.  He mutters in Swedish as he
treaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.

tMarge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand
treaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.

tIt comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with
ta snap of the wrist.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  All right, buddy.  On your
ttbelly and your hands clasped
ttbehind you.

<b>tTHE CRUISER
</b>
tMarge drives.  Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed
tbehind him.

tFor a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and
tthe periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge
tgrimly shakes her head.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
ttin there?

tShe glances up in the rear-view mirror.

tGrimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the
troad.

tMarge shakes her head.

tAt length:

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  I guess that was your
ttaccomplice in the wood chipper.

tGrimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is
tmotionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  And those three people in
ttBrainerd.

tNo response.

tMarge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  And for what?  For a little
ttbit of money.

tWe hear distant sirens.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  There's more to life than money,
ttyou know.

tShe glances up in the rear-view mirror.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  Don't you know that?...  And
tthere ya are, and it's a beautiful
ttday...

tGrimsrud's hollow eyes stare out.

tThe sirens are getting louder.  Marge pulls over.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  Well...

tShe leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling
tWHOOPS on her siren.

tShe turns on her flashers.

tShe leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.

tShe stares forward, shakes her head.  We hear the dull click
tof her flashers.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  I just don't unnerstand it.

tOutside it is snowing.  The sky, the earth, the road - all
twhite.

tA squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white.
tIt approaches in slow motion.

tAn ambulance punches through after it.

tAnother squad car.

<b>ttttttt FADE OUT:
</b>

<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tHIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL
</b>
tIt stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain.
tOne or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling
tpolice cruiser.

<b>tMOTEL ROOM DOORWAY
</b>
tWe are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen
twho stand on either side of the door, their hands resting
tlightly on their holstered sidearms.  One of them raps at
tthe door.

<b>ttttCOP ONE
</b>ttMr. Anderson...

tA title fades in:  OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA

tAfter a pause, muffled through the door:

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tt...  Who?...

<b>ttttCOP ONE
</b>ttMr. Anderson, is this your burgundy
tt88 out here?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tt...  Just a sec.

<b>ttttCOP ONE
</b>ttCould you open the door, please?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tt...  Yah.  Yah, just a sec.

tWe hear a clatter from inside.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>tt...  Just a sec...

tOne of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone
twhose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys.
tThis man turns a key in the door and then stands away.

tThe two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel
troom.

tThe rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two
tmen give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns.

tThe room is empty.

tCop one indicates the open bathroom door.

<b>ttttCOP ONE
</b>ttDale!

tThe two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the
tready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace.

tA man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window.

tThe policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and
tdrag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room.

tHis flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short,
tpiercing screams.

tThe cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing
tcontinues.  The policemen struggle to restrain him.

<b>ttttCOP ONE
</b>ttCall an ambulance!

<b>ttttCOP TWO
</b>ttYou got him okay?

tCop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts
tinto uncontrolled sobbing.

<b>ttttCOP ONE
</b>ttYah, yah, call an ambulance.

tJerry sobs and screams.

<b>tA BEDROOM
</b>
tWe are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.

tAfter a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and
tclimbs into bed, with some effort.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttOooph!

tNorm reaches for her hand as both watch the television.

tAt length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV.

<b>ttttNORM
</b>ttThey announced it.

tMarge looks at him.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttThey announced it?

<b>ttttNORM
</b>ttYah.

tMarge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay
tfixed on the television.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  So?

<b>ttttNORM
</b>ttThree-cent stamp.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttYour mallard?

<b>ttttNORM
</b>ttYah.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttNorm, that's terrific!

tNorm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure.

<b>ttttNORM
</b>ttIt's just the three cent.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttIt's terrific!

<b>ttttNORM
</b>ttHautman's blue-winged teal got the
tttwenty-nine cent.  People don't
ttmuch use the three-cent.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttOh, for Pete's - a course they do!
ttEvery time they raise the darned
ttpostage, people need the little
ttstamps!

<b>ttttNORM
</b>ttYah.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttWhen they're stuck with a bunch a
ttthe old ones!

<b>ttttNORM
</b>ttYah, I guess.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttThat's terrific.

tHer eyes go back to the TV.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>tt...  I'm so proud a you, Norm.

tNorm murmurs:

<b>ttttNORM
</b>ttI love you, Margie.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttI love you, Norm.

tBoth of them are watching the TV as Norm reaches out to rest
ta hand on top of her stomach.

<b>ttttNORM
</b>tt...  Two more months.

tMarge absently rests her own hand on top of his.

<b>ttttMARGE
</b>ttTwo more months.

tHold; fade out.
