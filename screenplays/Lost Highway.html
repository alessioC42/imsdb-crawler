<b>AS CREDITS ROLL
</b>
<b>EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>
We see a clean moving POV illuminated by headlights.  We're 
floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, 
desert landscape.  This gliding, eerie POV continues as 
credits roll. when the credits end, the headlights seem to 
dim and soon we're moving through BLACKNESS.

<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
in the blackness, a man, FRED, is sitting on a bed smoking a 
cigarette. we see his back, but with each glow of the 
cigarette ash, we see his face reflected in a mirror on the 
wall across from him.  In the darkness, there starts the 
sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large 
picture window just off screen.  As the curtain moves, hard-edged 
light begins crawling across the room, and we see 
everything clearly.  Fred is wearing a robe and pajamas, it's 
early morning.

CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE IN THE MIRROR - Blank expression - 
face somewhat obscured or distorted by smoke from the 
cigarette.

CLOSE UP 0N FRED'S ACTUAL FACE - Unshaven, haggard look, eyes 
seem empty, glazed over.  Fred is 32 years old, with dark
hair.

THE DOORBELL RINGS.  Fred looks up, startled by the noise.  
He looks at the digital clock: 5:30 a.m.

FRED STANDS, goes to an INTERCOM on the wall next to the 
mirror.  He pushes a button.

A VOICE comes over the intercom.

<b>ttttVOICE OVER
</b><b>ttttINTERCOM
</b>ttDick Laurent is dead.

Fred leaves the bedroom and goes through the house.  He is on 
the upstairs level.  He looks through a narrow slot window, 
but can't see the front door below.  He goes further in the 
house to a picture window that overlooks the street below.  
There is NOBODY there.

<b>INT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Fred is dressed to go out: Black sport coat and slacks, 
buttoned up white shirt.  He picks up a music case.  A woman 
comes into the room.  This is Fred's wife, RENEE, 30 years 
old, dark hair, dressed smartly, a drink in her hand.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttYou don't mind that I'm not coming
tttonight?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWhat are you going to do?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttI thought I'd stay home and read.

Fred looks her over, she's sexy without trying.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttRead?... Read what, Renee?

Renee sits down on a couch and sips her drink.  Fred comes 
over to her, kisses her on the neck, which makes her laugh.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttIt's nice to know I can still make you
ttlaugh.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttI like to laugh, Fred.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttThat's why I married you.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttWake me up when you get home.

Fred brushes her cheek with his fingers, allowing them to 
linger for a moment on her face.

Fred is on the bandstand.  He takes a solo on his saxophone.  
Fred plays hot, hard, neo-bop.  The BAND wails madly behind 
him.  The PATRONS explode onto the dance floor, making it a 
wild scene.  Fred Is a lion now, roaring away on his tenor, 
driving everyone nuts.

<b>EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DOORSTEPS - DAY
</b>
Renee in a bathrobe, opens the front door to collect the 
mail.  She sees a plain, clean, manila envelope lying on the 
step.  She picks it up.

CLOSE UP ON THE ENVELOPE - No stamp, no writing, blank.  She 
takes the mail from the box, and goes back into the house.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Renee opens the manila envelope. She's noticeably nervous 
when she sees a videotape inside.  She stares at it.

Fred enters, also wearing a bathrobe.  He sees Renee staring 
at the videotape - before she hears him enter.  When she does 
hear him, her eyes jerk away from the tape.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWhat's that?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttA videotape.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWho's it from?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttI don't know... There's no return address 
tton the envelope... In fact, there's no 
ttaddress on it.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttDoes it say anything on the tape?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttt(looking it over)
ttNo, nothing.

Fred walks over and picks up the tape.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWell, let's see what's on it.

Fred takes the tape to the VCR.  He inserts it into the
machine, and turns it on.  Fred goes toward the couch.

<b>ttttFRED (CON'T)
</b>ttt(to Renee)
ttCome on.

They sit on the couch in front of the television.

The TV monitor: We begin on the TV, then the videotape fills 
the entire frame.  The videotape shows the front of THE 
MADISON HOUSE, the camera panning slowly over it.  The 
picture is accompanied by an eerie DRONING SOUND.  After the 
camera pans back to the front door, the tape image turns to snow.

Fred and Renee stare at the snow for a few moments.  Renee 
looks relieved.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttIt must be from a real estate agent.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttMaybe.

We see a WIDE SHOT encompassing Fred, Renee, and the snowy 
image on the TV.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT:

<b>tttttttt FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Renee is seated at the dining room table - coffee cup and 
grapefruit in front of her.  She is wearing glasses, reading 
a book.  Fred enters, and sees Renee, who does not look up or 
acknowledge him.  Fred goes into the kitchen, which is just 
off the dining room.  He comes back into the dining room with 
a cup of coffee, and sits down with it opposite Renee.  He 
lights up a cigarette, sips his coffee, and looks at her.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttGood book, huh?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttt(she looks up)
ttHuh?... oh, yeah, it is.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttSame one you were reading the other
ttnight?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttWhat night?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWhen you didn't come to the club.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttOh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different
ttone.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttI called, you know.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttCalled?  When?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttFrom the club.  You didn't answer.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttI must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep
ttwhen you got home, wasn't I?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttYou were asleep when I got home, yes.

Renee goes back to her book.  Fred sips his coffee and 
smokes.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttt(without looking up)
ttI told you you could wake me up if you
ttwanted to.

Renee looks up at him now, takes off her glasses, and stares 
at him.

CLOSE UP OF FRED'S FACE - a disturbed expression.

Renee seems about to say something more, but stops, puts her 
glasses back on and resumes reading.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT:
</b>
<b>tttttttt FADE IN:
</b>

<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Fred is in bed waiting for Renee.  He hears noises from the 
bathroom - bottles clinking, drawers opening and closing.  
Renee comes out wearing a robe, which she sheds just before 
getting into bed.  Naked under the covers, she switches out 
her bedside lamp.  The only light in the room comes from the 
outside, through the windows.  Fred moves closer to Renee, 
puts his lips to her cheek, a hand on her breast.  She does 
not respond.  Fred pulls Renee to him, and kisses her 
passionately.  Renee accedes to his demands, but does not 
participate willingly.  He makes love to her voraciously, but 
her lack of passion disturbs him.  Fred can't stop, however, 
and when he comes she acts consolingly, stroking him 
maternally while he calms down.  He climbs off of her and 
retreats to his side of the bed.

CLOSE UP ON FRED'S EYES - which express his horror and 
humiliation.

They lie there in the dark silence for a while.

Fred turns back toward Renee in the darkness.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttI had a dream about you last night...

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttYeah?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttYou were in the house... calling my
ttname... but I couldn't find you.

</b>
Fred is walking slowly across the living room.

Fred's POV: moving - searching.

Fred stops and listens.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttt(tentatively - distant and off
tttscreen)
ttFred?  Fred, where are you?

The camera turns slowly back toward the hallway, and as it 
drifts it RISES UP following along the hall and turning 
slowly into the bedroom.  Renee is lying below in the bed.


<b>ttttFRED V.0.
</b>ttThen there you were... lying in bed... 
ttbut it wasn't you... It looked like 
ttyou... but it wasn't.

The camera suddenly dives violently at Renee - into a TIGHT 
CLOSE UP.  Her face registers TOTAL FEAR.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Fred is lying in bed with Renee, who is now backlit by her 
bedside lamp.  Fred looks at her shadowed face, but it's not 
Renee's face.  It's a face Fred has never seen before.  Fred 
quickly turns and switches on his bedside lamp, and looks 
quickly back at Renee, whose face is now her own.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttFred, are you all right?

Fred reaches out a hand and tenderly touches her face.  Renee 
covers his hand with her own, and closes her eyes.

<b>EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Renee finds another envelope on the doorstep.  She opens it, 
pulls out a videotape.  A large dog is BARKING incessantly 
somewhere in the neighborhood.  Renee looks around to see if 
she can see the dog.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADIS0N HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Renee brings the videotape upstairs with the rest of the 
mail.  She is a bit puzzled and unsettled.  She puts the tape 
down on a table.  She stares at it.  Fred comes in.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttYou're up early.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttThat dog woke me.  I lay there for a
ttwhile, then decided to get up.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWho the hell owns that dog?

Fred notices the tape and manila envelope on the table.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWhat's that?  Another tape?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttYes, I just found it on the step.

Fred picks it up.
<b>t
</b><b>ttttFRED
</b>ttDon't you want to watch it?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttI guess so.

Fred goes to the VCR and inserts the tape.  He turns the 
television on.  He is about to start the tape - he looks up 
for Renee.  She's hanging back.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWell, do you wanna watch it?

Again, Renee seems to be nervous about what could be on the 
tape, but she hides this from Fred and walks toward the 
couch.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttYeah.

Renee sits on the couch.  Fred starts the VCR and joins her.

As before, we first see it on the TV, then the videotape 
fills the frame.  This tape shows the front of the house, as 
before, then shows the INTERIOR of Fred and Renee's house -
<b>AT NIGHT.
</b>
The eerie DRONING SOUND goes throughout.

The camera glides at a very high angle near the ceilings 
looking down as it travels along a hallway and turns into 
their bedroom, where we see Fred and Renee sleeping.  The 
tape image then goes to snow.

Fred and Renee stare at the snowy TV picture.  After a few 
moments of silence, Renee gets up and switches off the set.  
She is visibly shaken, trembling.  She stares fearfully at 
Fred who seems less disturbed.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttWe've got to call the police.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttAll right.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

Renee is on the telephone.  Fred is pacing, smoking, behind 
her.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>tt...yes, I've been on hold for ten
ttminutes... I can't... All right, thanks.

Renee looks around anxiously.  Fred gives her his cigarette, 
which she puffs on.  He lights another and continues pacing.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttHello, yes... Good... My name is Renee
ttMadison... My husband is Fred Madison,

Renee hangs up.

<b>ttttFRED 
</b>ttSo?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttTwo detectives are coming out.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Two men in suits - the Detectives, ED and AL, are seated on 
the couch, watching the last part of the second videotape.  
The screen goes to snow and stays that way for several 
moments, until Fred shuts it off.


<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttThat's it.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttLet's have a look at the hallway outside
ttthe bedroom.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

All four of them go to the hallway, where Ed and Al look 
around, especially up toward the ceiling.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttVery strange.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttWhat is?

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttThe angle.  The high angle shot on the
tttape.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttHow'd the camera get so high like that?

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttAnd smooth... Almost no movement - back
ttand forth, I mean.

The Detectives enter the bedroom.  Fred and Renee follow.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttThis is the bedroom.

The Detectives look around without touching anything.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttDo you always sleep here?... In this
ttroom?... Both of you?


<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttThis is our bedroom.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttThere's no other bedroom?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttNo... There is, I mean, I use it as a

</b>ttt(shakes his head)
ttTone deaf.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttt(to Renee)
ttDo you own a video camera?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttNo. Fred hates them.

The Detectives both look at Fred.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttI like to remember things my own way.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttWhat do you mean by that?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttHow I remember them.  Not necessarily the
ttway they happened.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttDo you have an alarm system?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttYes, actually we do... but we haven't
ttbeen using it.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttWhy not?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttIt kept going off for some reason.  False
ttalarms.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttMight be a good time to try using it
ttagain.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttAnybody else have a key to the house.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttMaid?  Relative?

<b>ttttRENEE

</b>ttWe will.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttThanks, guys.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttIt's what we do.

Ed and Al get into the car and drive off.  Renee and Fred 
look at each other, warily, then go back into the house.  THE

Fred is on the bandstand, sweating, and honking his
saxophone.  He handles the horn roughly, braying like a beast 
as the CROWD gathered in front of the stage gyrates as one 
swept away in the madness of the moment.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

At the back, near the side door, Renee can be seen with TWO 
MEN, only one of whose faces we see.  The trio are going out 
the side door led by one of the men; we see only the back of 
his head.  Renee glances briefly at the bandstand before she 
exits with the two men.

<b>INT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - STAIRWELL / LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Fred is standing in the living room looking in the direction 
of the stairwell.  We HEAR someone's steps coming up the 
stairs.  It's Renee, who eventually comes into view.  She is 
holding another manila envelope.  She arrives at the top 
step.

She and Fred lock eyes.

Fred takes the envelope, opens it, and pulls out a third 
videotape. without saying anything, Fred takes the tape to 
the VCR.  He inserts it very carefully, slowly.  He hits 
play, turns on the television and he and Renee sit down on 
the couch together and begin to watch with great 
apprehension.

Again we begin with a WIDE SHOT and then the TV monitor fills 
the screen: We see the interior of the house at night.  The 
camera glides looking down from a high angle along the 
hallway and into the bedroom, where Fred and Renee are 
sleeping.

Again, the DRONING SOUND plays throughout.

in the bedroom where Fred and Renee are seen sleeping, 
SUDDENLY, Fred, on the tape, slowly awakens as the camera 
holds on him.  He rises and turns unnaturally in the bed, as 
if drawn up by his awareness of some strange presence in the 
room.  He comes to a sitting position, his head straining 
upwards, looking in the direction of the camera.  At this 
point, the videotape image turns to snow.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:

Fred and Renee are on the couch.  The TV remains on, showing 
snow.

Renee is very upset, crying.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttWhat the hell is going on?!

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttt(equally horrified -
tttfrightened)
ttI wish I knew.

Fred reaches over and tentatively takes Renee's hand in his.  
She trembles, allows him to touch her, but otherwise does not 
respond.  Suddenly, she jumps with fright.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttWhat was that?!!!

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWhat?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttOn the tape!  There was something else on
ttthe tape.

Fred gets up and rewinds it, passing an image.

<b>ttttRENEE (CON'T)
</b>ttThere!  Play it!

Fred runs the tape forward.

We see snow - then a half-second long MEDIUM SHOT of Fred on 
his knees near the bedroom wall on Renee's side of the bed.  
He is looking directly at the camera - his face a ghastly 
grimace, contorted.  His eyes are WIDE WITH HORROR.

Fred runs it back again and FREEZES the tape there on his 
tormented image.  This image fills the screen.  He and Renee 
stare at it.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:

The Detectives, with Fred and Renee are seated on chairs and 
the couch.  The three videotapes in their manila envelopes 
are stacked on a coffee table in the center.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttYou don't remember being awakened?  It
ttlooks like you were aware of someone.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttOr something.

</b>ttHas anyone made any threats to either of
ttyou recently?

<b>ttttED
</b>ttOr not so recently?

</b>ttNo, not to me.

Al, Ed and Fred all look at Renee.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttI...tno. No. No threats.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttWe'll take the tapes with us, if that's
ttall right with you?

Ed looks at Fred, then Renee, both of whom nod their 
agreement.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttWe'll see that the patrol of the house is
ttdoubled.

</b>ttWhere would you feel safe?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttI don't know. maybe a hotel.

Ed and Al are watching this exchange between Fred and Renee 
with keen interest.

There is a strained silence between them.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttDid you use the alarm system since we
ttwere here last?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttThe first night ... Not the last two.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttWhy not?

</b>ttActing paranoid?!!! Someone is in our

ttand you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I

Fred gets up, lights a cigarette, paces.

</b>ttI'll make sure the alarm is set from now
tton.

expression, pained and bewildered.

<b>ttttttttCUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A swinging party is in progress at Andy's house - the man
whose face we saw at the Luna Lounge with Renee.  ANDY, 37 
years old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd, 
making small talk, kissing and being kissed.  The PEOPLE here 
are wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold-chain-
wearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed 
provocatively, big hair and skin-tight dresses.  Through 
sliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people 
cavorting in a swimming pool.  Everyone has a drink in his or 
her hand.  Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty
glass to Fred who walks away with it.  Andy grabs Renee, and 
dances with her.  They laugh and talk.  Renee appears to be a 
bit intoxicated.

Fred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on, 
makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks. 
When the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then 
sets the empty glass down on the bar.  Then he swallows the 
other drink, too, and sets down the glass.

A MYSTERY MAN, tall, well-dressed and groomed, older than 
Fred, approaches him.

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttWe've met before, haven't we?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttI don't think so.  Where was it that you
ttthink we've met?

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttAt your house.  Don't you remember?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttt(surprised)
ttNo, no I don't.  Are you sure?

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttOf course.  In fact, I'm there right now.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttt(incredulous)
ttWhat do you mean?  You're where right
ttnow?

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttAt your house.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttThat's absurd.

The Mystery Man reaches into his coat pocket, takes out a 
cellular phone and holds it out to Fred.

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttCall me.

Fred snickers, like this is a bad joke.  The Mystery Man puts 
the phone into Fred's hand.

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b><b>tttt(CON-T)
</b>ttDial your number.

Fred hesitates, puzzled.

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b><b>tttt(CON-T)
</b>ttGo ahead.

Fred shrugs, laughs, dials his number. We HEAR a pick up as 
we stay on FRED'S FACE.

<b>ttttPHONE VOICE OF 
</b><b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttI told you I was here.

Fred, still holding the phone, stares at the man standing in 
front of him.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttHow did you do that?

The Mystery Man points to the phone.

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttttAsk me.

Fred, mirthful at first, as if it is a party trick of some 
kind, suddenly turns serious - it's obvious he's thinking now 
of the videotapes.  He speaks into the phone.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttt(angrily)
ttHow did you get into my house?

<b>ttttPHONE VOICE OF
</b><b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttYou invited me.  It's not my habit to go
ttwhere I'm not wanted.

Fred looks at the man in front of him, but speaks again into 
the phone.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWho are you?

The man laughs - identical laughs - both over the phone and in person.

<b>ttttPHONE VOICE OF
</b><b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttGive me my phone back.

The man in front of Fred reaches out his hand for the phone.  
Fred hears the line go dead, and he slowly passes the phone 
back to the Mystery Man who takes it, folds it, and puts it in his pocket.

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttIt's been a pleasure talking to you.

The man walks away from Fred.  Renee appears and comes up to Fred.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttI thought you were getting me a drink?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttJust a minute.

He takes Renee by the arm and goes over to the host of the 
party, Andy.  He grabs Andy and points across the room toward 
the Mystery Man, who is engaged in conversation with OTHER 
<b>GUESTS.
</b>
<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttAndy, who is that guy?

<b>ttttANDY
</b>ttt(looking at the Mystery Man)
ttI don't know his name.  He's a friend of
ttDick Laurent's, I think.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttDick Laurent?

<b>ttttANDY
</b>ttYes, I believe so.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttt(remembering something)
ttBut Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

<b>ttttANDY
</b>ttHe is?  I didn't think you knew Dick.
ttHow do you know he's dead?

Andy and Renee exchange a worried look, which Fred does not notice.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttI don't.  I don't know him.

<b>ttttANDY
</b>ttt(angrily)
ttDick can't be dead.  Who told you he was
ttdead?

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttHoney, who?... Who's dead?

Fred takes Renee by the arm away from Andy.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttLet's go home.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttBut...

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttNow!  We're leaving now! I didn't want
ttto come here in the first place.

Fred drags the reluctant Renee out of Andy's house.

Fred is driving fast and recklessly.  Renee is drunk and is 
smiling at him.

</b>ttHow'd you meet that asshole, Andy,
ttanyway?

Renee stares out the front window - thinks back.

<b>ttttRENEE
</b>ttIt was a long time ago... I met him at

There are only a couple of dim lights on, the house is mostly 
dark.  Fred moves slowly and carefully through his house -
searching each room for a possible intruder.

Fred's POV - moving creepily room by room through the dark 
house - past the telephone - down the hall to the bedroom.

There is NO ONE there.

He goes back outside for Renee.

Fred looks at Renee, then continues to look around the house, 
disturbed, seriously disquieted.  Renee, still tipsy, follows 
him, moving from room to room.

<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>Renee's POV - down the hallway.  There is just darkness at 
the end of the hall.  It is EERIE.  After a moment, Fred 
slowly walks out of the darkness toward Renee.  He walks out 
of the shot and the camera remains on the rectangle of 
darkness at the end of the hall.

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT:

<b>INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>Footsteps can be heard on the stairs.  Fred's head appears at 
the top of the stairway.  He comes up into the living room 
carrying a manila envelope, like the ones previously 
received.  His expression is strained.  He is alone.  Fred 
pulls a videotape out of the envelope and inserts it in the 
VCR, turns it on.  He sits on the couch and watches.  We go 
from a WIDE SHOT to a FULL FRAME SHOT of the video.

On the tape is the same nighttime interior of the house, 
accompanied by the DRONING SOUND.  The camera moves eerily 
down the hall toward the bedroom, sliding at a high angle.  
The camera turns slowly into the bedroom - looking down.

BLOOD is splattered over the floor, bed, walls.  The camera 
drifts.  THE DEAD BODY OF RENEE lies on the floor at the foot
of the bed.  She is badly mutilated.  Fred is hovering over 
her on the tape, ON HIS KNEES, A HORRIFIED, UNBELIEVING 
EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE.  On the tape, Fred turns away from 
Renee - his hands raised, dripping blood - her blood.  His 
movements are almost mechanical, constricted, as he strains 
strangely upwards seemingly against his will, as if feeling 
some enormous pressure.  He looks directly at the camera, his 
face a ghastly grimace, contorted, just before the taped 
image goes to snow.

Fred, sitting in front of the TV, shudders as the tape ends.  
He sits trembling, attempts to speak, almost chokes, and 
finally releases a tortured, warbly cry.

Fred looks up as if seeing something, he starts to stand,

We are in back of the house tracking slowly past the bedroom

samples of carpet, searching for fingerprints on furniture.

<b>INT. CITY MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>
Renee's CORPSE on a slab is rolled into an examining room by 
an ATTENDANT.  The entrance of the body is shown reflected in 
a chrome-framed mirror that juts out from a tile wall.  The 
Attendant prepares for the impending autopsy, laying out a 
rack of instruments, positioning the corpse.  As he is doing 
these things, the MEDICAL EXAMINER enters, accompanied by his 
GIRLFRIEND.  The M.E. is dressed formally, in a tuxedo.  The 
young woman is wearing a slinky dress with a fur wrap, 
pearls, spike heels.  The couple are close; she has an arm 
through his, and she laughs, nervously.  He is smoking a 
cigarette.

<b>ttttATTENDANT
</b>ttHi, doc. Workin' late tonight, huh?

<b>ttttM.E.
</b>ttParty at the mayor's house, George.  This
ttis his daughter, Joyce.

<b>ttttATTENDANT
</b>ttHowdy, Joyce.

<b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttHowdy, George.

The Attendant uncovers the body - individual parts are 
wrapped like packages from a butcher's shop, and labeled: L. 
ARM, HEAD, R. BREST (misspelled).

<b>ttttM.E.
</b>ttt(looking at the packages)
ttJust like Christmas.

He begins to unwrap them.

<b>ttttJOYCE
</b>ttI don't know if I can watch this.

The M.E. tosses his cigarette down on the floor.  The camera 
goes down on the smoking cigarette butt on the floor drain; 
smoldering there among hair and flesh gristle on the drain's 
filter screen.

<b>ttttM.E.
</b>ttt(Voice-over)
ttLeave any time you want, lover.  I won't
tttake it personally.

The camera stays on the drain as we HEAR the M.E. unwrapping 
the packaged body parts.  Joyce's high heels enter the frame 
around the drain.  She is stepping nervously, like a spooked 
horse.  The clatter of her heels is very loud.  We hear the 
M.E. chuckle.

The camera is behind a female FOREMAN in the jury box.  The 
shot begins on her shoes and travels up her body as she
stands.  Over her left shoulder we see Fred standing at the
defense table. Over her right shoulder the JUDGE is seated.

<b>ttttJUDGE
</b>ttHave you reached a verdict?

<b>ttttFOREMAN
</b>ttYes, we have, your honor.

<b>ttttJUDGE
</b>ttPlease hand it to the bailiff.

The BAILIFF goes to the Foreman, takes the paper from her, 
then takes it to the Judge.  The Judge opens it and reads it 
to himself, then hands it back to the Bailiff, who returns it 
to the Foreman.

<b>ttttJUDGE
</b>ttAnd what is your verdict?

The camera moves to Fred, registering his tension.  The 
camera goes to the Foreman's face.

<b>ttttFOREMAN
</b>ttWe the jury find the defendant guilty of
ttmurder in the first degree.

Fred faints.  Fe is lifted up by his ATTORNEY and GUARDS in 
attendance.  Fred revives slightly.

</b>ttFred Madison, the jury having found you 
ttguilty of murder in the first degree, it 
ttis my order that on a date to be

courtroom, pointing down on him.

Raquel takes a red teddy and holds it up to her chest.

Marian reaches for a pair of panties with a hole in the crotch.

Marian sticks a finger through the hole in the panties and 
wiggles it.  The girls giggle.  Raquel sees Andy walking into 
the store.  He is sneaking up behind Marian, and motions with 
a finger to his lips to Raquel not to say anything.  When 
Andy gets directly behind Marian, he puts his hands over her 
eyes.

The guards leave.  Fred stands near the cell door, begins to 
look around at the four walls, the single cot, the wash 
basin, and the toilet bowl without a seat.  He hears the 
muffled, DISTORTED NOISES - VOICES from the surrounding 
cells.  Lost voices - the voices of death row.  Fred 
realizes where he is now.  He walks over to the cot and 
slowly sinks down and sits on the edge.  Fred perched on the

The Warden hangs up the telephone and stays next to it.

We see one of the condemned man's WRISTS being clamped with

A metal halo is placed around the condemned man's head.  A 
large electrical cable leads off from the halo.

Electrically conductive ointment is smeared around the areas 
where the clamps have been placed.

The Clergyman moves close to the condemned man continuing to 
give the man his last rites.  When he is finished, he nods to 
the Warden.  The Warden approaches the condemned man.

The condemned man shakes his head "no".

The Warden and the others clear the room and the doors are

The EXECUTIONER steps into place near a huge lever.  He looks

Fnally he slumps down on his haunches, back leaned 
against the wall, eyes closed, letting the sun hit his face.  Very 
soon, however, the sun passes behind a cloud and Fred is 
bathed in shade.  Fred stands up, but is almost immediately 
hit by a searing pain in his head.  Fred holds his head with 
his hands, sinks down to his knees.  The Guard, who has been 
observing Fred from the doorway, comes over to him.

Fred's head and we see dark circles under Fred's eyes; his 
face is pale, teeth clenched, eyes tearing.  The Doctor takes 
a light utensil from his pocket, and inspects each of Fred's 
eyes.  He feels Fred's forehead.  After this, he allows 
Fred's head to drop down again.  The Doctor takes Fred's 
pulse.  He drops Fred's wrist.  He next takes Fred's blood 
pressure.

ttI can't sleep.

The Doctor goes over to a cabinet, unlocks a drawer, and 
removes a large blue pill.  He fills a paper cup with water 
from a dispenser, goes back to Fred and places the pill in 
Fred's mouth.  The Doctor tilts Fred's head up and pours the 
water down his throat, some of it dribbling down the front of 
Fred's shirt.  The Doctor looks into Fred's mouth to make 
sure he swallowed the pill.

illumines Fred's head, the forehead of which is swollen and 
discolored.  He staggers up and shuffles over to the call 
button, which he leans on.  A few moments later, a GUARD 
appears on the other side of the mesh.

Fred is on the floor lying on back. The camera comes 
slowly down at him from the ceiling, like a weight pressing

now.  He moans and rolls from side to side in the dimness, 
making grotesque, otherworldly sounds.  As the camera moves

dancing, as sexy and wild as it is possible for them to be.  
Andy is lying on his back on the rug, dressed only in 
undershorts and socks, the girls stomping feet stepping 
furiously around his head and body.  His eyes are closed at 
first, but when he opens them, he sees their feet in a blur.  
He tries to get up, but he is too strung out, and he 
collapses again.  Marian and Raquel take him by his hands and
feet and begin pulling him around the room as they dance.  
Andy is blitzed, smiling moronically.  The girls' breasts 
tumble out of their teddies.  Raquel drops her end of Andy, 
turns up the music even louder, and dances into a frenzy.  
Marian drops to her knees, Andy's feet on either side of her, 
shaking her shoulders and whipping her hair around.  Andy 
makes another attempt to sit up - he looks at Marian, reaches 
for her but falls back, dead to the world.  Raquel and Marian 
don't quit.

Fred is still curled on the floor, but spasms begin to rock 
his body.  He goes into convulsions, blood gushes from his 
nostrils.  His head is badly swollen.  Fred vomits repeatedly, 
and drags around in his mess.  Fred turns, straining upwards 
as we've seen him do before.  His face and head are hideously 
deformed.

Fred brings his shaking, tortured hand to his forehead.  He 
pulls his hand down across his face squeezing it as it goes.  
As his hand passes over his face, Fred's features are removed 
leaving a blank, white mass with eye sockets.

We move into the eye sockets and beyond.

unsettled, as he looks directly at us as we move closer to 
him.  The ghost image of a house appears behind Pete.  There 
is a girl, SHEILA, standing on the lawn in front of the 
house.  She is afraid and is trying to communicate with Pete.  
Pete doesn't seem to hear her and continues to stare directly

Daytons are a middle-aged, San Fernando Valley couple.  Bill 
Dayton is wearing a sport shirt with the short-sleeves rolled 
up. His skin is leathery, tanned and his thinning hair is 
slicked back in a duck-tail.  He's working-class, ex-biker.

feeling returns.

Pete is stretched out on his bed watching television.  He 
hears the front door bell ring - footsteps, and a moment or 
two later the door to his bedroom opens and three of his 
friends, CARL, LANIE and STEVE ("V") saunter in.

"V" drives a black, beat-up '66 Grand Prix.  Carl and Lanie 
are in the back seat, and Pete rides shotgun.  The four of 
them., are cruising down Van Nuys Boulevard along with many 
other MUSCLE CARS and LOW-RIDERS filled with KIDS looking for
action. "V's" car is making a hell of a noise.

walking up the boulevard.

<b>tttt"V" (CON'T)
</b>ttOh my, oh my.

<b>ttttLANIE
</b>ttKeep it in your pants, "V".

Some big cars nearby rev their engines.  "V" guns his car and 
it lurches roughly forward.  The sound of the rough running 
engine reverberates in Pete's brain.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttThis rod is a fuckin, embarrassment,
ttCarl.  Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?

</b>ttYou gotta be kiddin'... This is the

Pete shakes his bead with disgust.

"V" pulls the car off the boulevard into "Tops" drive-in.  
Cars are lined up at the "to go" window and all along the 
side of the building where people are hanging out under a 
long metal awning.  MUSIC is playing LOUD.

"V" pulls into a parking spot by the awning.  The headlights 
illuminate a group of HIPSTERS - some dancing, some just 
hanging out.  THREE or FOUR GIRLS hanging out together turn 
toward "V's" car.  They see Pete in the front seat, and one 
of the girls, Sheila, smiles and walks toward him.

<b>ttttSHEILA
</b>ttHey.  Where have you been?

Pete talks to her through the open window while "V", Carl and 
Lanie climb out through "V's" door.  "V" leans back in.

</b>ttt(to Pete)
ttYou want somethin'?

"V" walks off with the others to the "take out" window.
Sheila leans in closer to Pete.

<b>ttttSHEILA
</b>ttI missed you.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttYeah?...

<b>ttttSHEILA
</b>ttYeah.

Sheila's girlfriends saunter over and lean on the car around 
her - looking in at Pete.

The bowling alley is divided into a game room area, a bar/ 
restaurant area and a bowling area.

Pete and the group stroll into the bar and take a large 
booth.  MUSIC is playing LOUD.

A WAITRESS takes orders for drinks.

Bowling pins clatter loudly in the distance.

"V" takes one of Sheila's friends and dances with her.

Sheila takes Pete by the arm and pulls him up to dance.  The 
music is fast, but they dance slow.

<b>ttttSHEILA
</b>ttWhy haven't you called me?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttSorry... I...

Sheila looks around and moves closer to Pete.  She whispers 
urgently, worried.

Sheila stares seriously at Pete, but then laughs too.

Sheila leans in very close to Pete and whispers in his ear.

Sheila pushes her mouth on Pete's and they kiss., Pete breaks

Mr. Eddy takes the big Pullman along the scenic Mulholland

up fast behind the Mercedes.

Mr. Eddy looks into his rearview mirror.

<b>ttttMR. EDDY
</b>ttOh, shit... Is that what I think it is?

Pete turns and looks back.  A car is TAILGATING them, the 
silver-gray Infiniti.  The two assistants in the backseat 
turn nonchalantly to take a look - then they return their 
look to Mr. Eddy.

Mr. Eddy starts to take a slow burn - keeps looking at the 
Infiniti in the rearview mirror.

The assistants look to one another take a deep breath.

Mr. Eddy slows slightly and then keeps the Pullman steady at 
32 m.p.h. The Infiniti moves up ten feet behind the Pullman, 
and blows its horn.

Mr. Eddy rolls down his window.

The assistants are paying close attention - they buckle their 
seatbelts.

Pete notices a tension in the car.  He watches Mr. Eddy's 
face.

Mr. Eddy pulls slightly to the right of the road, pastes a 
polite, courteous smile on his face, puts his left arm out 
the window and waves the Infiniti by.

The Infiniti jets forward and swerves around the Pullman.  
When the cars are side by side, the irate DRIVER in the 
Infiniti gives Mr. Eddy "the bird" and flies past.

CLOSE ON MR. EDDY'S RIGHT FOOT as it slams down on the gas 
pedal.

The Pullman catapults forward toward the Infiniti.

Pete is thrown back - he grabs on to the door handle and the 
seat for support.

The Pullman gains on the Infiniti in a flash.  The Infiniti 
tries to go faster, but Mr. Eddy's Pullman has much more 
power.

<b>ttttMR. EDDY
</b>ttt(clenched teeth)
ttThis is where power and mechanical
ttexcellence pays off.

Mr. Eddy jams the Pullman into the back of the Infiniti and 
pushes it faster and faster along Mulholland.  The Driver of 
the Infiniti tries to brake and blue-gray smoke streams out 
from beneath the Infiniti with a scream of burning rubber.

At a turn, Mr. Eddy steers his massive Mercedes and the 
Infiniti ahead on a gut-wrenching path off the road, up a 
mountain and into a little glade of trees.  Dust and brush 
fly everywhere.

Mr. Eddy and his assistants leap from the Pullman and make 
for the Driver's side of the Infiniti.

Mr. Eddy throws open the Infiniti's door and pulls the 
trembling and screaming Driver out like a rag doll.

Mr. Eddy pulls out his .44 Ruger Blackhawk and pistol whips 
the Driver to the ground.  He smashes the butt of his gun 
across the man's face, tearing a gash which starts to gush 
with blood.

Mr. Eddy's assistants each draw .45's and point them at the 
Driver.

Mr. Eddy, red-faced with anger, leans close to the man.

Pete is on a skate - working under a car.  The radio is on 
and a tune comes on that begins to drive Pete crazy - it 
gives him a headache.  The tune is one of Fred Madison's be-
bop saxophone pieces.  Pete gets out from under the car and 
goes to the radio.  He changes the station.  PHIL, another 
mechanic working nearby, looks at Pete.

<b>ttttPHIL
</b>ttWhy'd you change it?  I liked that.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWell, I didn't.

Pete rubs his throbbing head and when he gets back under the 
car, he lays on the skate - unable to work.

A car horn honks and the sound reverberates inside the 
garage.

Pete looks up - from under the car he sees the wheels of a 
Cadillac roll up just outside the open garage doors.  He sees
a car door open and Mr. Eddy's feet appear and walk in his 
direction.

Pete winces and wheels himself out from under the car.  He 
stands as Mr. Eddy walks up to him, then freezes as he sees -
back behind Mr. Eddy, sitting in the passenger seat of the
car - a beautiful blonde-haired GIRL, who looks exactly like 
Renee.

CLOSE UP BEAUTIFUL GIRL - she looks exactly like Renee except
she is about eight years younger.  The girl is staring right 
into Pete's eyes.

Mr. Eddy steps between Pete and the girl - blocking her from 
Pete.  Mr. Eddy smiles at Pete - not noticing or not letting 
on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between 
Pete and the girl.

<b>ttttMR. EDDY

Mr Eddy pinches Pete's cheek - which Pete doesn't like, but 
aliows.  Mr. Eddy gives Pete a big smile then turns, goes 
back to his car, escorts the beautiful girl outside where the 
Pullman is waiting.

Pete watches her walk and move.  He watches her until Mr. 
Eddy drives her away.  She steals one last glance back at 
Pete before she disappears.

When she is gone, Pete replays the scene of seeing this 
beautiful girl over again in his mind.  The scene is 
accompanied by Lou Reed's version of "This Magic Moment".

<b>ttttttttFADE OUT:

Pete is sitting perched unsteadily on the very edge of his 
bed.  He HEARS a succession of highly-amplified SOUNDS at 
intervals with eerie stretches of silence: CRICKETS in 
fractured cadence a distant TELEVISION - a FLY buzzing 
slowly in the room a MOTH'S wings beating against light 
bulbs in the ceiling fixture - the washing of DISHES.

Pete's reaction to these sounds is one of petrified 
confusion.  Underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly, 
steady DRONE.

Pete gets up off the bed, unsteadily.  He moves toward his 
bedroom door.  As he moves the amplified SOUNDS shift.

He can hear laughter.  The laughter seems to be LOUD, but at 
the same time coming from people who are trying to contain 
the laughter - to hide it.

Pete opens his door and peers out.

Pete's POV down the hall toward the living room - his mother 
and father have stopped laughing and are turned with guilty 
smiles in his direction.  They are smoking a joint, passing 
it back and forth.  They are not looking directly at him.  
They seem to be looking, but not seeing.

Pete's parents POV down the hall toward Pete's room.  There 
is no one there - just an empty hallway.

Pete's parents continue to stare, but then turn away toward 
each other - they start to laugh quietly again.

Pete's Pov - the hallway and the living room - there is no 
one in the living room. It's empty.

streaming into an empty coffee cup.  The camera stays on the 
top of Al's head until he has completed the last few spurts 
of his micturition.  Al's head comes up and he opens the 
passenger side door and dumps the urine into the street.  He 
closes the door and zips up his trousers.

He turns off the boulevard and drives through San Fernando 
valley neighborhood streets.

He pulls up in front of Sheila's house and honks his horn.

He lights a cigarette while he waits.

In a few minutes Sheila comes out and leans in the passenger

arm around her.  She takes a drag from his cigarette and puts 
her head on his shoulder.

Pete pulls over into a dark shadow under a tree and stops the 
car.

He cuts the engine, turns to Sheila and kisses her.  She 
breaks away.

Sheila puts her lips up' close to his and whispers.

Pete kisses her and she kisses him back.  They start to feel 
each other and Sheila takes off her tight sweater.  She's 
wearing no bra and Pete begins to feel her breasts while she 
unbuttons his shirt.  They continue to kiss hard throughout.

putting tools away.

Pete is ragging off some grease from his hands when he

At a tralfic light, Pete revs up the big Camaro and expertly 
peels out between on-coming cross traffic.  He swerves 
between two cars going in opposite directions - blasts up a 
block and hangs a hard right - disappearing from view.

Ed and Al go out into the traffic after them, but the 
swerving, screeching cars braking around them form a barrier

Pete rides up the boulevard with the "Cruisers".  He spots 
"V's" car parked at "Tops".

He pulls in beside "V's" car and shuts down the engine.  The 
usual crowd is at the drive-in, including Sheila.

Pete goes up to "V" and Carl and says hello.  He lights a 
cigarette and leans up against a steel pole supporting the 
awning above.  "V" and Carl both notice that Pete is in a bad 
mood.

Sheila is over with her girlfriends.  She hasn't seen Pete 
arrive.

Suddenly Sheila looks over in Pete's direction.  She looks 
like she's seeing something, yet not seeing anything.  She 
keeps looking - staring.

Sheila's POV she sees "V", Carl and a lot of PEOPLE, but 
Pete is not there.

Pete looks at Sheila.  He's unsettled and confused by her 
staring, but not seeming to see him.  He watches her turn 
away and take one of her girlfriend's hands - leading her out 
to dance to the LOUD music.

Pete watches her dance.  Suddenly, he can't see her.  He 
thinks maybe she may be dancing on the other side of the 
building - out of view.  He moves to look and his head is 
struck by a violent pain.  He grabs his head with his hand 
and leans forward.  "V" grabs his arm.

<b>tttt"V"

Pete looks up at "V".  He doesn't seem to recognize him -
"V's" head is a featureless blur.  Pete shakes his head 
trying to drive out the pain.

He looks over again for Sheila.  He sees her there dancing 
with her girlfriend.

<b>tttt"V"
</b>ttPete... You okay?

<b>ttttPETE

Pete stands back up against the post - turns to "V" -
recognizing him.

</b>ttI'm, okay... You okay?

</b>ttSure, I'm okay.

Some drunk GUYS move over to Sheila and her girlfriend.  They 
cut in on the girls.  The guy with Sheila puts his hand 
around her waist and pulls her against her will into a grind.  
She tries to push him away, but he holds on tighter -
laughing with his buddy.

"V" and Carl look at Pete as he pushes off the post.  Pete 
crosses quickly to the man dancing with Sheila.  He slams his 
fist into the man's nose - almost snapping the man's neck in 
the process.  The man goes down bleeding.

Pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready 
for a fight.  He hits the man in the gut - the man's head 
goes down and Pete brings his knee up cracking the man's 
face.  The man's torso flies up with Pete's knee - then 
continues on as the man falls to the floor.  Pete picks him 
up, ready to hit him again, but the crowd pulls him off.

Pete stands and turns - pulsating with anger.  Sheila is 
there beside him.

We move in on a nervous EXHALE OF SMOKE to a CLOSE UP of 
Alice waiting.

We see a CLOSE UP of the man guarding the door.

We see a CLOSE SHOT of the man bench pressing a lot of 
weight.

Suddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the 
closed door.  The Slickster moves off the door and opens it a 
crack.  He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he 
turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through.

Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking.

She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger 
room.  There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all leaning 
comfortably at different points on the walls.  There is only 
one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it.

No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and 
from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of 
the room.  She does, and she instinctively turns to the man 
sitting in the chair.

They all just stare at her silently.  She looks around 
nervously - her eyes return to Mr. Eddy's.

Suddenly, a man steps quickly up to her - draws a pistol and 
cocks it against her head.

Alice goes weak in the knees.  Her eyes fill with fear.

The men continue to stare.

Mr. Eddy gives Alice a small gesture as if to say "well?".

Somehow she knows what they want, even though they haven't 
asked for it with words.

Alice starts to undress - slowly - in as sexy a way as she 
knows how.

The men just stare without expression.

When she is completely naked, Mr. Eddy gestures her over to 
him.  Soon she is on her knees in front of him - making 
herself available for whatever he wants.

Mr. Eddy's POV - Alice looks in his eyes.  She reaches her 
hand up to stroke his cheek...

<b>tttttttt CUT TO:

Alice's hand reaches up and strokes Pete's cheek.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWhy didn't you just leave?

Alice doesn't say anything.  She drops her hand - looks down.

<b>ttttPETE (CON'T)
</b>ttYou liked it.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttIf you want me to go away, I'll go away.

The feelings shift inside Pete.  Alice looks in his eyes.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttI don't want you to go away.

Alice smiles a little - leans in and they kiss.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttt(whispers)
ttI love you, Pete.

They kiss some more.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttt(desperate whisper)
ttI love you, Alice.

They start to make love - undressing each other and kissing 
all the while.  Alice stops.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttSo, should I call Andy?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttAndy?

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttThat's his name...Andy.  Our ticket out

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttYeah.  Call him.

Alice gets serious.

</b>ttOkay...

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttLemme call him now.  Make sure he's not
ttalready busy tomorrow night.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttOkay.

Still entwined with each other, Alice reaches for the phone
and dials a number. It starts to ring and she smiles at Pete
when she hears it being answered.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttAndy?... It's me, Alice.  How ya doin?...
ttt(whispers)
ttAndy... I can get away tomorrow night...

ttBut, we still have a coupla things to

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttOh, yeah?... What else?

Alice reaches down between their legs.  Pete smiles.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttThis... and this.

They start to go at it again - at first slowly and tenderly -
then wildly.  Alice tears herself away and looks up at Pete.

<b>ttttALICE (CON'T)
</b>ttAre you my man?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttt(getting hotter)
ttYes.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttAre you gonna be a man about this, Pete?

Pete looks at her - starting to understand what she means.

</b>ttAre you?

Pete stares at her - then nods.

Pete drives up and parks his Camaro in the driveway.  When he 
gets out of the car, he sees Sheila standing by the front 
step.  She is looking in his direction, but doesn't seem to 
see him.  She SUDDENLY turns and looks up the street - she 
<b>YELLS.
</b>
<b>ttttSHEILA
</b>ttt(total horror)
<b>ttTHERE'S SOMEONE WITH HIM!!
</b>
As she yells, she starts to look around wildly - then her 
eyes follow the path the Camaro took into the driveway - then 
the path Pete took to where he has been standing all this 
time.  Her eyes find Pete and she stands by the front step.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttt(frightened)
ttSheila?

She heads toward him.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttSheila, what is it?... What are you doin'

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttSheila...

Sheila has come up and is grabbing Pete by the front of his 
shirt.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttHey... Sheila.

<b>ttttSHEILA
</b>ttWhat's the BITCH'S name?!

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttLook Sheila... I'm sorry...

Sheila starts beating him in the face and chest.

<b>ttttSHEILA
</b><b>ttYOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
</b><b>ttYOU'RE SORRY!!
</b>
She starts crying and hitting him harder.

<b>ttttSHEILA (CON'T)
</b><b>ttFUCK YOU!!
</b>
Sheila's screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood.  
INSIDE PETE'S MIND the SOUNDS are even LOUDER.

Bill comes out of the house.  Claire is behind him waiting on 
the front porch.

Sheila beats Pete and trips him to the ground.  She is 
sobbing as she tears at him.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttSheila... Stop...

<b>ttttSHEILA
</b><b>ttFUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
</b>
Bill comes up to Sheila and takes her gently by the 
shoulders.

Sheila jerks around and looks up at Bill.

<b>ttttBILL
</b>ttWhy don't you two come inside and talk 
ttthings over quietly... Come on... Come on 
ttin, Sheila.

Sheila gets to her feet - crying.  She looks down at Pete, 
who remains lying on the front lawn.

For Pete, every word and every sound is LOUD and DISTORTED.  
The DRONING SOUND returns.

<b>ttttSHEILA
</b>ttt(to Pete)
ttYou are different.

<b>ttttBILL
</b>ttSheila... 

<b>ttttSHEILA

The phone inside the house starts to ring.  Claire turns in 
the doorway and goes to answer it.

</b>ttSheila... Don't.

<b>ttttSHEILA
</b>ttI don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr. 
ttDayton... I won't bother you or any

Sheila runs off crying.  Pete and Bill watch her go.

Claire comes to the door.

<b>ttttCLAIRE
</b>ttPete... There's a man on the phone.  He's
ttcalled a couple of times tonight.

Pete pulls himself up.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWho is it?

<b>ttttCLAIRE
</b>ttHe won't give his name.

Pete walks slowly inside - stares at the phone and picks it 
up.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttHello.

</b>ttt(phone voice)
ttHey, Pete... How ya doin'?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWho is this?

<b>ttttMR. EDDY
</b>ttYou know who it is.

Bill and Claire have stopped in the living room - watching 
Pete.  Pete is going crazy with Mr. Eddy on one end, and his 
parents staring at him on the other.  He waves his parents 
away, but they leave slowly and reluctantly.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttMr. Eddy?

<b>ttttMR. EDDY
</b>ttYeah... How ya doin', Pete?

<b>ttttPETE

ttall right?

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttYeah.

<b>ttttMR. EDDY
</b>ttThat's good, Pete.  Hey... I want you to

Pete can hear the phone being handed over to someone.  There 
is a long silence.  Pete can hear breathing.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttWe've met before, haven't we?

Pete freezes.  His mind is scrambling.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttI don't think so.  Where was it that you
ttthink we've met?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttAt your house.  Don't you remember?

</b>ttNo. No, I don't.

</b>ttWe just killed a couple of people...

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWhat?

Pete can hear Mr. Eddy laugh in the background.

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttYou heard me... We thought we'd come over
ttand tell you about it.

Pete is getting pale with fear.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWhat's goin' on?

<b>ttttVOICE
</b>ttGreat question!! In the east ... the far 
tteast... when a person is sentenced to

ttand fire a bullet into the back of their

tteven years after the death sentence has 
ttbeen pronounced... This uncertainty adds 
ttan exquisite element of torture to the

ttpleasure talking to you.

Pete can hear the phone being passed again.

<b>ttttMR. EDDY
</b>ttPete... I just wanted to jump on and tell
ttyou I'm really glad you're doin' okay.

The phone goes dead and Pete sits - fearfully pondering his 
fate.  He hears a NOISE and turns.

Down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring 
at him.

CLOSE UP ON PARENTS staring in the direction of the living 
room as if sensing something, but not seeing.

PARENTS POV - The hall and living room beyond.  There is no 
one there.

<b>ttttttttDISSOLVE TO:

A City Bus pulls up to the stop.  The doors open and Pete 
climbs on.

Pete rides along in the empty bus.  He stares at his 
reflection in the dark window.

<b>EXT. STREET - BUS STOP - NIGHT
</b>
The bus stops and Pete gets out.  He starts walking.

<b>tttttttt     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. DEEP DELL PLACE - NIGHT
</b>
We see a street sign saying "Deep Dell Place".  Pete walks up 
the street looking at numbers.

He finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House.

He stares at the house from the sidewalk.

Lights are on upstairs and down.  The hot wind moves big 
shadows of trees over the front of the house.

Pete looks at his watch.  It reads: 11:05 p.m.

He walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and 
comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back.

He stops and listens.  He pulls himself up and over the 
fence, but crashes on something on the other side.

He freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through 
the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece.  
He hears echoing sounds of love making.

He makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries 
the back door.  It opens.

<b>tttttttt     CUT TO:
</b><b>INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living 
room.  Pete stops short and stares.  A movie projector is 
running in the living room.  A porno film is being projected 
on a huge screen at the far end.  Alice is in the porno film.  
A man is fucking her from behind - with LOUD SLAPPING SOUNDS 
of flesh banging flesh.  Her face is in the foreground.  Her 
eyes look out directly at Pete.  She is loving every minute 
of it.  Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control.  
He looks around.  He sees clothes scattered about.  He picks 
up a girl's sweater and smells it.  He looks up the stairs.

Feet appear at the top of the stairs.  They start down.

Pete runs for the bar.

Along the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well-
stacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table, 
and ducks behind the bar.

He can hear Andy approaching.  He can hear Andy gather two 
glasses.  He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno 
film.  He clenches his teeth with rage.

Suddenly, Andy moves right in front of him.  They see each 
other.  Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the 
bronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head.  Andy falls.  
The breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his 
forehead.

Pete turns.

Alice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for 
a pair of panties.  Lipstick is smeared around her mouth.  
She is carrying a half-filled pillowcase.  Her porno film is 
playing on the wall 
behind her.

These images jump and spin in Pete's mind.  He moves 
unsteadily toward her.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttYou got him.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttt(still holding the figurine)
ttAlice, I...

Pete starts to tremble.  He drops the figurine.  He tries to 
embrace her.

There is a crashing noise behind him.

Pete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the 
wound in his head, THEN CHARGING FULL SPEED AT PETE.

Andy hits him hard, and Pete goes down.  When Pete hits the 
ground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms.  This, and 
Andy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the 
rectangular glass-topped coffee table.  There is a sound like a
hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner 
embeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead.

CLOSE UP OF ANDY'S HEAD - impaled on the sharp corner of the 
table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach 
touching the floor.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttt(amazement - no feeling)
ttWow!

Pete pulls himself off the floor.

Pete moves close to Alice, they drift to the glass coffee 
table, staring for a few moments at Andy's dead body.

While Pete stares, unbelieving, at Andy - Alice hurriedly 
picks up her sweater and puts it on. On the sofa next to it 
lay Andy's trousers.  She goes through the pockets, finds a 
roll of cash bound by a rubber band.  Alice hands the roll to 
Pete.

<b>ttttALICE (CON'T)
</b>ttPut this in your pocket.

Alice kneels next to Andy's body and quickly removes his 
Rolex wristwatch, a couple of rings and the gold chain 
dangling from his neck.  These items she puts inside the 
empty pillowcase.

Alice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the 
living room and puts them on.  Pete watches her, trembling, 
unable to say anything.

She comes back to Pete, who starts breathing irregularly, 
hyperventilating.

<b>ttttALICE (CON'T)
</b>ttYou all right?

<b>ttttPETE,
</b>ttWe killed him.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttYou killed him.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttAlice?

Alice slides up close to Pete.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttIt was an accident... Accidents happen
ttevery day.

Pete clutches her, eyes squeezed tight, as if he is holding 
on for dear life.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttAlice...

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttt(pushing back)
ttWe gotta get the stuff and get out of
tthere.

Alice starts off across the living room with the pillowcase.

Pete opens his eyes, he sees Alice move as a blur.  He looks 
around the room, which spins in and out of focus.  His eyes 
land on, a PHOTOGRAPH in a frame on the wall.  This photo 
troubles him.  Pete squints, then points to the photograph.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttIs that you?  Are both of them you?

CLOSE UP OF THE PHOTOGRAPH - Four people appear in the frame: 
Andy, Renee, Alice and Mr. Eddy.

Alice stops and comes back.  She looks at the photo, walks 
closer to it, and points at herself.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttThat's me.

She turns to Pete.  Pete is staring at the photograph - at 
Alice and Renee in the photograph.  His nose is bleeding
profusely.

<b>ttttALICE (CON'T)
</b>ttPete?...

Pete starts to reel - blood from his nose soaking his shirt.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWhere's the bathroom?

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttUp the stairs - down the hall.

Pete runs up the stairst- about to get sicker. Alice watches
him go with a nuance oftdisdain.

<b>tttttttt      CUT TO:

</b>
Pete staggers toward the bathroom at the rear right of the 
hallway.  THE HALLWAY SUDDENLY BECOMES HAZY, DIFFERENT AND 
<b>LONGER THAN IT APPEARED TO BE.
</b>
Pete wanders down this "changed" hall.  On his left, he 
identifies a door with the number 25 on it.  He pauses for a 
moment in front of it, then goes on until, on his right, he 
comes to a door with the number 26 on it.  He enters through 
this door.

Inside is a WOMAN in front of a mirror with a MAN.  Her arms 
are resting on a shelf under the mirror as the man takes her 
from behind.  The man's face is blank, featureless, and is 
buried in the woman's back - we can't see it.

Pete now sees that the woman is an extremely whorish version 
of Alice - she's looking at Pete's reflection in the mirror.  
He's looking at her reflection in the mirror.  Pete's head is 
pounding.

<b>ttttWOMAN/ALICE
</b>ttt(to Pete)
ttDid you want to talk to me?

Pete rubs his head - the pain is severe.

<b>ttttWOMAN/ALICE
</b><b>tttt(CON'T)

ttDid you want to ask me "why"?

Pete staggers out of the room.

He closes the door.  The hallway has "changed" back to Andy's 
hallway.  The doors no longer have numbers.

Pete walks, unsteadily, back down the hall - faltering.  He 
starts down the stairs.

<b>tttttttt      CUT TO:

Pete comes downstairs to the living room and sees Alice at 
the desk in the corner, filling the pillowcase with cash and 
jewelry.

She has a PISTOL in her hand.

Alice turns when she hears Pete and they study each other's 
face as Pete makes his way to her.  His head is still 
throbbing with pain.  His focus goes from her face to the gun 
- which is pointing right at him - back to her.  Alice 
smiles.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttDon't you trust me, Pete?...

She laughs and hands him the pistol.

Alice jumps in Andy's car and tosses the bulging pillowcase 
in the back.  Pete takes the revolver out of his belt.  He 
opens the driver's side door of Andy's car and slowly sits 
inside.  He sets the pistol on the seat between them.  He 
looks up at her.  She smiles wildly.  Pete slalms the door -
starts the car and they drive off.

Alice and Pete pull up into the driveway of a house at the 
end of a street at the edge of a desert.  Alice gets out into 
a hot wind.  Pete stays in the car as she goes up to the 
house.

Pete's POV: He watches Alice ring the doorbell.  She waits 
in front of the door for a few moments, her hair blowing in 
the wind.

A HOUSEBOY opens the door.  Alice says something to him -
Pete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his 
driver's side window is down.  All he can hear is the hot 
wind blowing.

The Houseboy moves out to where he can see Pete, waiting in 
the car.  The Houseboy and Alice exchange information.  The 
Houseboy points out toward the desert.  Alice turns back to 
the car. The Houseboy watches her.

Pete and Alice pull off the two-lane highway onto a barely 
discernible dirt road that cuts through the dark desert.

<b>tttttttt      CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
</b>
Pete and Alice drive up to a ONE ROOM CABIN built on stilts 
next to a dry lakebed.  They both get out and go up the 
stairs to a porch where Alice knocks on the door.  There is 
no answer.

Alice opens the door, but there is NOBODY INSIDE.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttWe'll have to wait.

The hot wind continues to blow.

Alice and Pete walk back down to the car.

The HEADLIGHTS are on and Alice reaches in through the window 
and switches on the RADIO.  She can't get anything in but 
static, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out.  
She hits the "seek" button.  The radio starts to search.

Pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her.  
Alice walks slowly to him.

The camera captures this from a back seat perspective - then 
drifts toward them.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttWhy me, Alice?  Why choose me?

The radio sticks on a particular tune - a tune filled with
longing. Alice begins to dance.  She takes Pete's hand and
pulls him close to her.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttSo we can be together... You still want
ttto be with me, don't you Pete?

Alice gives Pete that wild smile.

<b>ttttALICE (CON'T)
</b>ttMore than ever?

She kisses Pete over and over.  He begins to kiss her back.  
She starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare 
of the headlights, the hot wind caressing them.

The scene is out of a dream.  Alice and Pete help each other 
undress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind 
whips at their bodies.

They sink down on the soft ground and start making love.

The lights from the headlights combine with the starlight, 
bathing them in a pristine glow.

The music fades and the radio begins to "seek" through static 
for another station.  The music it finds now is LOUD and 
<b>INTENSE.
</b>
Alice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her 
approach to love making with Pete.  She is the aggressor, 
highly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not 
giving, insatiable.

The headlights flare their bodies in blinding light.  They 
become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light.

Pete is trying desperately to please her - to have her.

The driving music fills with cracks of piercing static.  The 
radio strains to hold the station.

Pete's white-hot body clings to Alice.  He chokes with 
emotion.

<b>ttttPETE
</b>ttI want you... I want you...

With a burning smile, Alice rolls them out of the beams of 
light into the darkness.  The wind billows a black cloud of 
dust around them.

Alice pulls away from Pete and brings her dark mouth to his 
ear.

<b>ttttALICE
</b>ttYou'll never have me.

Alice glides away from Pete and stands up looking down at him 
from above.

She turns and walks, naked, to the cabin where she disappears 
within it.

Pete turns, face down on the ground in the darkness.  He's 
holding his head and shaking.

As he starts to stand - he turns into the glare of the
headlights and we see that it is NOT PETE - BUT FRED.

As Fred stands up, the car's LIGHTS DIM and the RADIO FADES.

Fred looks at the car.  He sees some movement inside.  Fred 
looks closer and sees the figure of a man in the back seat.

CLOSE UP OF THE MAN - it's the Mystery Man from Andy's party.

<b>ttttVOICE FROM BEHIND
</b><b>ttttFRED
</b>ttHello.

Fred turns toward the cabin and sees the Mystery Man now 
standing in the doorway.

Fred turns again to the car, but this time it's empty.  He 
looks back at the cabin and sees the Mystery Man still in the 
doorway.

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttHere I am.

Fred is dizzy with fear and confusion.

He pulls on his trousers and shoes and walks up the steps to 
the cabin toward the Mystery Man, who goes inside.  Fred 
stops in the doorway.  He looks around.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttWhere's Alice?

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttAlice who?

Fred looks around again but there is no one there except the 
Mystery Man - standing in the center of the room.  Fred 
stares at him.

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b><b>tttt(CON'T)
</b>ttHer name is Renee.  If she's told you her
ttname is Alice, she's lying.
ttt(filled now with anger)
<b>ttAND YOUR NAME, WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR
</b><b>ttNAME?!
</b>
Fred freaks, scared to death. He bolts down the stairs to 
the car, stumbling more than once. 

Fred attempts to start the car which is drained of electrical 
charge by the use of the headlights and radio.

The Mystery Man appears in the doorway of the cabin.  He 
starts toward Fred.

The starter motor moans as Fred twists the key frantically.

The smiling Mystery Man is almost at the car,

The engine catches.  Fred revs it - throws the car in reverse 
and peels out away from the Mystery Man, whose hand is
reaching for him.

Fred swerves the car around - throws it in drive, and takes 
off across the dark desert.

<b>tttttttt      CUT TO:

<b>EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Fred pulls up onto the two-lane highway.  An old, rusted 
roadsign is posted there.  It reads: "LOST HIGHWAY".

<b>tttttttt      CUT TO:
</b>
Fred is driving along the two-lane desert "lost highway".  
The wind is picking up even stronger than before.  A big 
storm is blowing in.

Fred sees a sign glowing just ahead that reads: LOST HIGHWAY 
HOTEL.  The sign is swaying and blinking as the gusts hit it.

Fred pulls in and stops under the sign and stares at it.

He gets out of the car, tucks the pistol in his belt under 
his shirt and enters the hotel, which is an old two-story 
building.

<b>tttttttt     CUT TO:

Fred walks up to the registration desk, where a CLERK is 
smiling at him in a half-baked way.

tthits.

Fred pulls the roll of bills from his pocket.

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttI need a room.

</b>
<b>INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
The hallway is strangely similar to Pete's vision upstairs at 
Andy's.  Fred comes to the door numbered 25, looks at his key 
which says "25" and unlocks the door and enters.

<b>tttttttt     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 25 - NIGHT
</b>
Fred takes the revolver out of his shirt and puts it under 
the pillow on the bed.

He sits on the edge of the bed.  He takes a cigarette from a 
pack in his shirt pocket and lights it with a match from a 
book of "Lost Highway Hotel" matches.

Fred smokes the cigarette, listening to the wind blow.  
Lightning cracks outside the window.

Fred crushes the cigarette out in the ashtray on the bedside 
table.  As the last of the blue smoke drifts away, Fred falls 
back on the bed.

Fred closes his eyes.

Renee is in bed with Mr. Eddy/Laurent.  He and Renee are 
feverishly making love as the storm rages outside.

<b>tttttttt DISSOLVE TO:

<b>INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A criminal investigation is under way.  Ed and Al are 
present, among a fleet of LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL who are 
busy dusting for fingerprints and examining the murder site.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttHey, Al, look at this.

Al walks over to where Ed is looking at the photo on the 
wall.  Al looks at it.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttIt's her, all right.  Fred Madison's 
ttwife ... with Dick Laurent and Mr. Dent-
tthead over there.

CLOSE UP ON THE PHOTOGRAPH - that shows RENEE AS THE ONLY 
WOMAN IN THE PICTURE, standing between Andy and Mr. Eddy/ 
Laurent.

<b>ttttAL
</b>ttWe've got Pete Dayton's prints all over
ttthis place.

<b>ttttED
</b>ttYou know what I think?

<b>INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 26 - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Renee is sitting half dressed on the edge of the bed, pulling 
on her stockings.  Mr. Eddy/Laurent is asleep next to her.  
Renee stands up, finishes dressing, then leans down and 
kisses her lover while he sleeps.  Renee leaves the room, 
closing the door as quietly as possible behind her.

As the door CLICKS, Mr. Eddy/Laurent wakes up.  He sits up 
and gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table, shakes 
one out, lights it with a book of "Lost Highway Hotel" 
matches, and smokes it while seated on the edge of the bed.

<b>tttttttt     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 25 - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Fred, still fully dressed, is waking up, AS IF IN A TRANCE -
the same attitude he had on the videotape.  He strains 
upwards and looks eerily around the room.  He gets up and 
crosses slowly to a window.  He takes the edge of the window 
curtain and pulls it back.

The view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel.

Fred's POV: He sees Renee, down below, walk over to a car, 
get in and drive away.

Fred walks back to his bed, picks up his revolver from under 
the pillow, crosses the room to the door and walks out.

<b>tttttttt    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN

Fred crosses over to Room 26 and knocks softly on the door.

<b>tttttttt    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 26 - PRE-DAWN
</b>
Mr. Eddy/Laurent is standing - almost dressed, when he hears 
the knock.

<b>ttttMR. EDDY/LAURENT
</b>ttRenee?

He goes to the door and opens it a crack.

As the door opens, Fred smashes the gun into Mr. Eddy/ 
Laurent's face and pushes his way inside the room.

Fred hits Mr. Eddy/Laurent viciously again with the gun 
barrel.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent is bleeding profusely from gashes on his 
forehead and nose.

<b>ttttMR. EDDY/LAURENT
</b>ttWhat the fuck? What's going on?

<b>ttttFRED
</b>ttt(pointing the gun at him)
ttYou're coming with me.

Fred puts the pistol up against Mr. Eddy/Laurent's head and 
marches him out of the room - past the camera's eye.

The camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the 
window, through which we see Fred and Mr. Eddy/Laurent appear 
down below in the back lot.

Still watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr. 
Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into 
the trunk of a car.  Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into 
the driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car 
- the Mercedes 600 Pullman.

As Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground. 
The hand moves the window curtain further to one side.  The 
camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery 
Man.  The Mystery Man leans fully into the frame and watches 
Fred drive off down the Lost Highway as day breaks.

<b>tttttttt      CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAYBREAK
</b>
Fred is driving along the road.  Suddenly he pulls the car 
off the road and drives over the dirt and brush to a deserted 
spot, stops and gets out.

Fred opens the trunk. When he does ...

Suddenly, Mr. Eddy/Laurent charges up and attacks Fred -
knocking them both to the ground.  Mr. Eddy/Laurent tries to 
strangle Fred, but Fred's anger is too great.  Fred tears 
loose and gets Mr. Eddy/Laurent in a hold bending his head 
back.  Fred's hand reaches out behind him - feeling, 
searching.

A KNIFE appears.

it comes into Fred's hand from another.

Fred slices Mr. Eddy/Laurent's throat, and throws him down.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent squirms on the ground - his hand grasped 
around his throat - trying to hold his neck together.  Blood 
is flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of 
him as be turns and opens his mouth with a gurgling sound.

Fred stands, facing him, his pistol out now - pointing right 
at Mr. Eddy/Laurent's forehead.

CLOSE UP ON MR. EDDY/LAURENT - he lifts his head and stares 
at Fred.  Blood is rushing out of him.

<b>ttttMR. EDDY/LAURENT
</b>ttt(wet and jagged)
ttWhat do you guys want?

The camera pans around to Fred - we see that the Mystery Man 
is standing beside Fred, and it is the Mystery Man who is 
holding the gun, not Fred.

The Mystery Man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a 
little watchman TV.  He turns it on and hands it over to Mr. 
Eddy/Laurent, who manages to take it.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks down at the small television screen.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent's POV: As he watches the TV screen, we move 
in until the screen fills the frame - as with the former 
videotapes.  The full frame of the TV screen reveals -

<b>INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
We see the movie screen on a wall in Andy's living room.  
Marian, Raquel and RENEE'S images are being projected on this 
screen, simultaneously involved in pornographic acts with two 
men. Watching this movie in Andy's living room are several 
people in shadows behind the light of the projector.  Among 
them we see RENEE and MR. EDDY/LAURENT standing next to ANDY.
Mr. Eddy/Laurent and Renee are hot - kissing - his hand is up 
under her skirt.  They are watching the porno film.  They are 
watching murky images of sex turning to violence.

In a CLOSE UP we see Renee and Mr. Eddy/Laurent in the 
shadows looking out at the film, both half-smiling, stoned, 
aroused.

The image on the Watchman changes now.

<b>EXT. DESERT - DAYBREAK
</b>
On the Watchman TV screen Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees an image of 
Fred and the Mystery Man staring at him.  The Mystery Man's 
image speaks.

<b>ttttMYSTERY MAN
</b>ttt(on TV screen)
ttNow you can hand it back to me.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees the Mystery Man's image reach out a 
hand.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks up.  The Mystery Man has his arm 
outstretched just as it was on the video image.  Mr. Eddy/ 
Laurent hands the Watchman back, and locks eyes with the 
Mystery Man.

<b>ttttMR. EDDY/LAURENT
</b>ttt(wet and jagged)
ttYou and me, mister, we can really out-
ttugly the sumbitches, can't we?

The mystery Man unloads the pistol into Mr. Eddy/Laurent, who 
jerks and dies in the dust.

The Mystery Man then leans close to Fred and whispers in his 
ear.

The camera moves in, past the Mystery Man to a CLOSE UP OF 
FRED'S EYES as he listens.

The camera cuts back wide to reveal Fred holding the gun.  He 
is standing alone - there is no Mystery Man.  Fred turns to 
go back to the car.

Fred drives up to his house in Mr. Eddy/Laurent's Mercedes

to the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL.  There is a BEEP sound.

Fred is behind the wheel of his car.  Behind him are the 
cops.

CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE - through the front windshield.  The 
shot is wide enough to reveal the cop car in hot pursuit.

Fred's face begins to change again, grotesquely contorting as 
he races into the vortex.  His tormented SCREAM blends with 
the howling SIREN of the police car gaining on him.
