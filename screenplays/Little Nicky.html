<b>tFADE IN:
</b>
<b>tEXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT
</b>
tA beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers
tsprinkling.

tWe PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,
twhere we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He
thas a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly
tthe lights turn on.

<b>ttttPEEPER
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttShowtime!

tWe see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's
twindow.  She is wearing business attire.

<b>ttttPEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttRough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy?
ttt(takes bite of sandwich)
ttWell you'll feel better once you slip
ttoff those work clothes and get into some
ttsweats.

tThe mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing
ther feet.

<b>ttttPEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttOh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me
ttrub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't
ttuse my hands.  Heh heh heh heh...

tHe sips some wine.

tThe mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off,
trevealing a nice bra.

<b>ttttPEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttLooks like Victoria just told me her
ttsecret.

tThe peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing
tthe words as he goes.

<b>ttttPEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttThursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,
ttfirst brassiere sighting...
ttt(stops writing)
ttI will pleasure myself to this image for
ttmonths.  MONTHS I TELL YOU!

tThe mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks
tin wearing a scouts uniform.

<b>ttttPEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttYoung Scottie Dunleavy.  What
ttunfortunate timing.  You mother was just
ttgetting comfy.

tThe son talks to his mother excitedly.

<b>ttttPEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttYes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great
ttknots today or whatever.  Now get out.

tThe son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.

<b>ttttPEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttNow what.  This simply won't do.

tThe peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son
tanswers.

<b>ttttSCOTTIE
</b>ttHello?

<b>ttttPEEPER
</b>ttHello, Scottie.  Why don't you go
ttdownstairs like a good boy and let your
ttmother freshen up.

<b>ttttSCOTTIE
</b>ttWho is this?

<b>ttttPEEPER
</b>ttJust a little birdie.  A birdie who
ttwants to see if your mother's panties
ttmatch her bra.

<b>ttttMOTHER
</b>ttOh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up
ttour tree?

tThe peeper gets nervous.

<b>ttttPEEPER
</b>ttTell her no.  Tell her it's just a big
ttbird.

tThe peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.
tWe SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He
tshoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls
tto the ground with a thud.

<b>ttttPEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttMrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And
ttwear your bikini.

tThe peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television
tout the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead.

<b>ttttt   HARD CUT:
</b>
<b>tINT. HOLE - DAY
</b>
tThe peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on
tall sides.

tThe peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way
tscreaming like a five-year old girl.

<b>tPEEPER'S POV
</b>
tWe see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the
tpeeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He
<b>tSCREAMS.
</b>
<b>tEXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL
</b>
tWe see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.  We hear screaming.  Wham!
tWe see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in
ta heap in a shallow pit of coals.

tDazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the
tfire wall at different levels.  (NOTE: All the arrivals
tclothes are now burned & shredded).

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER (O.S.)
</b>ttWelcome!

tThe peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his
tstation greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.

<b>ttttPEEPER
</b>ttAm I in hell?

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER
</b>ttWhat do you think?

tA GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.  We
tleave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...

<b>tMATTE PAINTING HELL
</b>
<b>tMUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALEN
</b>
tThe VAST and insane kingdom of Hell.  A road leads toward it
tlike the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  We see
tthe black castle in the distance.  The camera zooms into the
tcastle, to one particular window.

<b>tINT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
tLooks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,
theavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no
tbed - Devils don't sleep).  Nicky is air guitaring to the
tsong.  Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled
<b>t"NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX."
</b>
tThe head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring
tNICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttt(embarrassed)
ttHey...

<b>ttttJIMMY THE DEMON
</b>ttYour father wants to see you and your
ttbrothers in the throne room.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttOkay, but Jimmy, when the house is
ttrockin', don't forget the knockin'!

<b>tINT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY
</b>
tADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.  They're aiming for
tpeople's faces that are coming through the wall.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttI knew it.  He's finally retiring.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttI've been waiting on this day for ten
ttthousand years.

tHe throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.

<b>ttttHUMAN DARTBOARD
</b>ttAaaah!

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttIf the old man picks me to take over
ttHell, I'll keep the torture going twenty
ttfour seven.  No breaks.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttWell Dad says it's the breaks that make
ttthe torture.  You have to let people
ttfeel a sense of relief.

tCassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS
tin the eye.

<b>ttttHUMAN DARTBOARD
</b>ttAaaaaaaaaaaah!

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttThen again, the beauty of Dad retiring
ttis what he says doesn't matter anymore.

tCassius pulls out the dart.  The eye comes with it.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttI'll take that.

tCassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.  THWACK!
tIt splatters like a grape.

<b>ttttHUMAN DARTBOARD
</b>ttWas that really necessary?

tNicky enters sheepishly.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttHey, how's Daddy's little girl doing
tttoday?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttGood, thanks.

tCassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttHey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?

tCassius' eyes start glowing red.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttActually, I'll take a rain check on0

tNicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible
tforce.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttGot ya!

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttt(picking up his head)
ttYes, you got me...

tNicky's head slams back down again.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttGot ya, again!

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttt(picking head up)
ttGot me for sure, yes...

tHe grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the
thead.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttGot ya!  Now here's the big finish...

tNicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his
town crotch.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttOh no.  Please Cassius...

tNicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer
tuntil it latches on to Nicky's crotch.

<b>ttttNICKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttAaaaah.

tCassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own
thand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't
tnotice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small
tdevil horns), enters behind them.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttWhat are you boys doing?

tCassius releases Nicky's hand.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttNothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the
ttfurniture.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttCassius, didn't I tell you to stay out
ttof your brother's mind?

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttI forgot.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttMaybe this will help you remember.

tDad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the
tnose, sending him back against the wall and down to the
tfloor.

tDad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of
tconfidence and power.

<b>ttttDAD (CONT'D)
</b>ttNow everybody sit down.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttHey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying
ttdown my monsters of metal compilation
tttape.  I really think it's a
ttmasterpiece.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttOkay, kid, we'll listen to it later.

tHe leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the
twindow the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his
thead.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad
tcloses the curtains.

tNicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of
this throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip
tof which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at
this three sons.

<b>ttttDAD (CONT'D)
</b>ttMy dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was
ttthrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules
tthere in hell for ten thousand years.
ttAnd after this ten thousand years had
ttpassed, he decided to abdicate his
ttthrone...

tConfused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.

<b>ttttDAD (CONT'D)
</b>tt...to step aside.
ttt(Nicky lowers his hand)
tt...and let me become the ruler of hell.
ttThis, as some of you might know, is my
ttten thousandth year as Prince of
ttDarkness.  So I think the time has come
ttto discuss who will succeed me.

tJimmy the Demon walks in.

<b>ttttJIMMY THE DEMON
</b>ttKnock, knock.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttYes, Jimmy.

tHe whispers in Dad's ear.

<b>ttttDAD (CONT'D)
</b>ttNo, no, that's not what I said.  He can
ttkeep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta
ttgo.

<b>ttttJIMMY THE DEMON
</b>ttt(turning to leave)
ttOh, and don't forget, you're shoving a
ttpineapple up Hitler's ass at four
tto'clock.

tDad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention
tback to his sons.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttThis was a very difficult decision,
ttbecause I have three wonderful sons.  I
ttmean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless.
ttAnd Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And
ttNicky, so...so...

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttDon't worry about coming up with
ttanything.  It's cool.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttSuch a sweet boy.  But after much
ttthought and careful consideration, I've
ttdecided that the ruler for the next ten
ttthousand years is going to have to
ttbe...me.

<b>ttttCASSIUS AND ADRIAN
</b>ttt(dumbfounded)
ttWhat!?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttHallelujah.

tThey all look at Nicky.

<b>ttttNICKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttI mean...tough break.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttThe important thing for the stability of
ttour rule is to maintain the balance
ttbetween good and evil.  And I don't
ttthink any of you are ready for that
ttresponsibility yet.  You need the wisdom
ttthat comes only with the passage of
tttime.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttDad!  This is Hoyashit.

tDad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human
tDartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the
ttongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttRight.  Right.  Send him in.
ttt(to the boys)
ttI'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back
ttto work.

tNicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.  Adrian stops.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttYou sure about this decision, Dad?

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttI'm telling you, pal, it's the right
ttthing to do.

tHITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by
tJimmy.  They head towards the closet.

tInside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out
ta relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head "no."  Dad walks
tover to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.
tDad nods "yes."  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends
tHitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...

<b>tCLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES
</b>
tAs the pineapple's jammed up his ass.

<b>ttttHITLER
</b>ttHoly schnit!!

<b>tEXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY
</b>
tCassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing
twith souls.  Both are pissed.  There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot
tlooking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttYou work your ass off for ten thousand
ttyears, hurting people, helping others
tthurt people, then you get a decision
ttlike that.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttAnd he's dead serious.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttIt's just such a slap in the face.

tAdrian turns to the Monster.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttUm, excuse me, we're having a private
ttconversation here.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttYeah, get out of here!  Beat it!

tCassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face.
tThe Monster shrugs and walks off.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttTwenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa
ttLucifer said, "It is better to rule in
tthell than serve in heaven."  Well, I'm
ttgetting tired of serving in Hell.  We
ttneed a place where we can rule.

tCassius throws a rock at the Monster.  He yelps, then turns
taround, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.
tCassius sees this and gets enraged.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttOh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it
tton!! Let's see what you got!

tThe Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in
tan "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.

<b>ttttCASSIUS (CONT'D)
</b>ttThat's what I thought!

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttt(to Cassius)
ttCould you concentrate for five seconds?

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttI am concentrating.  Where can we rule?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttWhat do you think about...Earth?

tCassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.

<b>ttttADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>ttWe could create our own hell there.

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>ttYou saying we go up there and kill
tteveryone?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttEventually, Cassius.  But first we
ttcorrupt as many as we can so that when
ttwe do destroy them...

<b>ttttCASSIUS
</b>tt...their damned souls will be ours.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttIt's our time, brother.

tThe two look at each other.  They start running toward the
tfire wall.  Knocking souls out of their way.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER
</b>ttHey, what are you doing?!?

tThey get closer to the fire.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou can't go through there.  The fire
ttflows in, not out.

tThey dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou know something?  You guys suck!  You
ttreally suck!

tSirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we
thear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the
tfirewall hard.

<b>tINT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER
</b>
tDad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix
ttapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb."
tPause.  Dad exhales.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttNow that was an experience.  "You are
ttonly coming through in waves."  That
ttline blows my mind every time.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttDefinitely.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttI don't care what kind of mood you're in
ttat the start of that song.  When it's
ttover, that mood has been altered.  Wow.
ttGreat shit.  What's next?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttWell, I thought that after messing with
ttyour head, I'd give you a little kick in
ttthe keester.

tHits the tape player.  "Enter Sandman" blasts.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttWho is this, Metal-lick-a?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttMetallica, Dad.  Come on.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttI was just playing with you.

tDad and Nicky dance to the song.

<b>tINT. THRONE ROOM - LATER
</b>
<b>tCLOSE ON DAD.
</b>
<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttI'm sorry.  After careful consideration,
ttI regretfully have to decline.

<b>tON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.
</b>
<b>ttttDAN
</b>ttC'mon, man, I'm just asking for one
ttSuperbowl ring.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttIn exchange for eternal damnation of
ttyour soul?  You're too nice of a guy for
ttme to want to do that to you, Mr.
ttMarino.

<b>ttttDAN
</b>ttYou did it for Namath.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttYeah, but Joe was coming here anyways.
ttJust go back to Earth and enjoy your
ttrecords and the Hall of Fame and the
ttbeautiful family and all that.

<b>ttttDAN
</b>ttThis is bullshit, man.
ttt(gets up to leave)
ttI'm gonna win the Superbowl this year,
ttwith or without you!

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttNow you're talking.

tDan exits.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttYou're a good devil, Dad.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttAnd I also happen to be a Jets fan.

tNicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint
tsirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his
tknees.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER
</b>ttYour highness, Cassius and Adrian have
ttescaped from hell.  They went through
ttthe fire, and they broke it.  I think
ttthey took the New York tunnel.  I tried
ttto stop them, but they overpowered me,
ttsir.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttOh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off
ttyour knees.

tThe Gatekeeper stands up.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER
</b>ttThanks for being so understanding, your
ttworship.  You're the man.  You've always
ttbeen the man.

tDad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge
tboobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We
tonly see them from the front for a second.
tFrom behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the
tnipples as he talks to Nicky.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
</b>ttt(to Nicky)
ttI'm lucky to get away with just the head
ttboobs, right?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttCoulda been much worse.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER
</b>ttThat's what I'm thinkin'...

tDad is staring off.  He looks shaken.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttThis is bad, Nicky.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttHow bad?

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttI'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are
ttbroken, no new souls can get in, which
ttmeans I'll start to deteriorate into
ttnothing.

tGRANDPA LUCIFER enters.

<b>ttttLUCIFER
</b>ttWhat's with all the whoo-whoo noises?

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttEverything's fine, pop.

<b>ttttLUCIFER
</b>ttLast time you said that the renaissance
tthappened.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttPlease, pop, just go back to your room.

<b>ttttLUCIFER
</b>ttt(regarding gateskeeper)
ttCan I take him with me and have sex with
tthis head?

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttSure, pop.  Whatever you want.

tThe gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER
</b>ttOh, this is gonna be a whole new
ttlifestyle for me, isn't it.

<b>tEXT. GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTER
</b>
tWe see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED
tSOULS in hell are sneaking off.

tThe DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do.

tDad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.

<b>ttttDAMNED SOULS (O.S.)
</b>ttWhat's going on?  Where are we?

tWe keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud
tthuds.

<b>ttttJIMMY THE DEMON
</b>ttNothing's getting through that.  The
ttfire is solid as a rock.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttWe gotta get this bad boy burning again.
ttIdeas?

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttTo do that Cassius and Adrian have to
ttcome back through the other way.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttSo go get 'em, Dad!

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttI'm too weak.  The process has already
ttbegun.

tDad holds up his hand.  His pink is hanging by a thread.  We
tsee the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttSo go get 'em, Jimmy!

<b>ttttJIMMY THE DEMON
</b>ttI'm just a demon, Nicky.  I don't got
ttdevil blood in me.  I'd last two minutes
ttup there with your brothers.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttYou're not saying it's up to me?

tThe MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as
tif to say, "oh no."

<b>ttttNICKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttI've never been to Earth.  I've never
tteven slept over at some other dude's
tthouse!

<b>ttttJIMMY THE DEMON
</b>ttYou're the spawn of Satan.  You got it
ttin you.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttNicky, the worst thing that could happen
tton Earth is you get killed, in which
ttcase, boom, you end up back here.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttAre you telling me I have to go to Earth
ttand kill my brothers?

<b>ttttJIMMY THE DEMON
</b>ttNot go.  They left together at the exact
ttsame time.  They gotta come back
tttogether at the exact same time.

tDad takes an ornate flask from his robe.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttHere.  Get them drunk from this.  One
ttsip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once
ttyou've got both of them, you bring the
ttflask back through the gate.

tDad's pinky is hanging.  Jimmy pulls it off and examines it.
tThe Monster gags.

<b>ttttJIMMY THE DEMON
</b>ttYour ol' man's got less than a week.

tNicky looks petrified.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttNo.  This can't be happening.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttSon, just do your best.

tNicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster,
twho runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire.

tNicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster
ttaps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get
ta move on."

<b>tINT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY
</b>
<b>tA SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL
</b>
tPAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between
ttwo tracks, to a putrid puddle.  Nicky breaks through the
tsurface, sputtering.  We hear a rumbling in the near
tdistance.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttOkay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This
ttdoesn't look too bad.

tNicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and
<b>tWHAMMM!
</b>
<b>tttEXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tNicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in
tthe coal pit.  His Dad limps back to him.

<b>ttttJIMMY THE DEMON
</b>ttYou were gone ten seconds.  What
tthappened?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttI got hit by a big light that was
ttattached to a lot of metal.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttThat's a train, son.  Don't stand in
ttfront of them.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttWell, I guess I'm going to have to take
tta mulligan on this one.

<b>ttttDAD
</b>ttPlease, Nicky, get back up there.
ttt(his ear falls off)
ttTry to hurry.

tNicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.

<b>tINT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY
</b>
tNicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and
thops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is

tIn his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to
tidentify their passengers at the airport.  On the sign is
tscrawled "NICKY."

tNicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat.

tThe throng of commuters making their way through the terminal
tare giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking
taround suspiciously, talking to the dog.

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttMy name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of
ttyour father's.  He's asked me to help
ttyou out.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttI just need to find my brothers and be
tton my way, Beefy.

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttIt's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers
ttcan possess people.  So they probably
ttwon't look like themselves.  You have to
ttbe suspicious of everyone.

tNicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttOkay, "bro," this jig is up...

ttJust get in the bottle.  Just slide

</b>ttOh.  Sorry.

<b>tEXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY
</b>
tA BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.  People put

</b>ttOh how the Lord loves you.  All his

ttt(passerby puts in money)
ttHe thanks you for your kindness.
ttt(another woman puts in money)
ttGod bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you...
ttThe Lord loves you...

tWe see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.  The PREACHER
tsniffs.

<b>ttttPREACHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttThe Lord does not love you.  I

ttt(thrusts his cross in Nicky's
tt   face)
ttYou make the Lord very nervous.

ttI'm burning...ahhh.
ttt(running away)
ttThe Devil walks among us!

tHe runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.

<b>ttttPREACHER (CONT'D)
</b>ttOh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!

tHe gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance.  He
tdisappears.  Beefy turns to Nicky.

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttMakin' friends already.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttt(shivering a little)
ttIt's freezing up here, Beefy.

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttYou're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have
ttthe same physical needs and limitations

ttyou some warm clothes.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttI also have this odd pain in my mid

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttThat pain is hunger.

<b>tEXT. BENCH - DAY
</b>
tK-mart bag is next to a bench.  PAN UP to see Nicky wearing
tan extra warm SKI OUTFIT.  Sitting next to him on the bench
tis Beefy.  Between them is a big bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED
tCHICKEN.  Nicky takes out a drumstick.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttSo far, so good.  Now what?

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttPut it in your mouth.

tNicky puts it in his mouth.  Holds it there.

<b>ttttBEEFY (CONT'D)
</b>ttMove your teeth up and down.

tNicky does.  He chews for a long time.

<b>ttttBEEFY (CONT'D)
</b>ttNow you gotta swallow it.  Tilt your
tthead back and let the meat slide down
ttyour throat-hole.

tNicky does.  He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttHey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttIt sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're
ttgonna need your energy.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttI got energy up the ying-ying.  Let's

tNICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right
tinto the path of a moving bus.

<b>tINT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tThe Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs.  The
tgatekeeper is wearing a modified bra.  He seems to be
tenjoying it.  We hear a THUD.  They look down to see Nicky on
tthe ground.  (We didn't see him flying through this time.)

tThe Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop.  Kind of
tembarrassed.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER
</b>ttHey.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttThat's a pretty brassiere.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER
</b>ttThanks.

<b>ttttNICKY

ttthis?

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER
</b>ttYou got it.  Could you maybe not tell
ttanyone about this?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttYou got it.

tNicky turns and walks toward the firewall.  As soon as his
tback is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I
tlove your boobs."  The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh
t(we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).

<b>tEXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY
</b>
tBeefy is walking with him down the street.  Nicky is crazy
tcautious.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttFrom now on.  I'm just going to avoid
ttall moving metal objects.

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttGreat.  Now your father gave me some
ttdeposit money for a nice pad on the
ttUpper East Side.  But I misplaced it.

<b>tttt  FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

tBeefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club.  Champagne

tdancing for him.

<b>tttt  FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

tNicky and Beefy.

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttSo I found this other joint for you.
ttBut you're gonna have a roommate.

<b>tINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
tA scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the
tphone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttt(on phone)
ttI know exactly how you feel... The night
ttReagan was elected, I said to my mother,
tt"Is this man going to blow up the world,
ttMommy?"  Then we both cried for like an
tthour.
ttt(knock at the door)
ttSomebody's here.  Call you later.

tTodd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by
this side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttHello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I
ttunderstand you're seeking a roommate, as
ttper your advertisement in the Village
ttVoice.  Would it be possible for me to
ttfill the slot?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttUh, don't you want to know what the rent
ttis?

tNicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both
tnod imperceptibly.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttYes.  What is rent?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttEight-hundred, split down the middle.
ttTuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with
ttmy scene partner so the living room will
ttbe off limits.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttOff limits.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttRight.  And as far as household items:
ttwe can share the soap, but we'll split
ttthe cost 60/40.
ttCause the person who physically goes out
ttand buys the soap shouldn't have to pay
ttas much as the other guy.
ttt(looks at Nicky)
ttAren't you boiling in that outfit?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttNo.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttIt's like eighty degrees in this
tthallway.  You from the South?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttYeah.  The deep South.

tNicky laughs a little too hard.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttWhy is that funny?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttI don't know.

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttAnd sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.

tTodd turns and goes into the apartment.

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttYou'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttGot ya.
ttt(to Todd)
ttIs it okay if I do the sleep thing?

<b>ttttTODD
</b>ttYeah, your bedroom is right over there.

tThe door closes.  Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  It
treads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.  Beefy raises his leg over
tit.

<b>tINT. NICKY'S ROOM
</b>
tNicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully
tclothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that
tfamiliar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we
thear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices.

tSLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands,
tlooking concerned.

<b>tEXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING
</b>
tWe HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a
tlarge church.

<b>tINT. CATHEDRAL
</b>
tCLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the
tsteps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation.
tWe see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He
tgins his homily.

<b>ttttCARDINAL
</b>ttIn today's gospel, the Lord tells us who
ttwe are to live if we wish to attain the
ttsplendor of Heaven... or something like
ttthat.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in
ttthe Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that.
ttAbraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.

tThe crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is
tstanding on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box
twith the top open.

<b>ttttCARDINAL (CONT'D)
</b>ttYep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of
tthibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really
ttdone anything for us?  Has he ever put a
ttJaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever
ttgiven any of my enemies the herpes?  No.
ttHe hasn't done a damn thing for any of
ttus.

tA MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.

<b>ttttMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
</b>ttThe Lord gave my son the strength to get
ttoff drugs.

<b>ttttCARDINAL
</b>ttMa'am, I know your son, and believe me,
tthe was better off on drugs.  He's a
ttbore.  At least when he was smoking
tthashish, he made me laugh occasionally.

tA YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up.

<b>ttttYOUNG MAN
</b>ttAfter we tried for many years, the Lord
ttfinally helped my wife conceive a baby.

<b>ttttCARDINAL
</b>ttNo, your best friend Fitzie helped your
ttwife conceive a baby.  He helped her
ttconceive it all night long.

tFitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts
tto "raise the roof."  Then thinks better of it.  The Cardinal
tpoints to a well-dressed man in the front pew.

<b>ttttCARDINAL (CONT'D)
</b>ttHow about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever
ttdo anything for you?

tThe Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.

<b>ttttMAYOR
</b>ttt(standing)
ttWell, I wish I could think of something,
ttCardinal, but to be honest with you, I
ttcan't.  Kind of makes you wonder if
ttthere even is a Lord.  If there is any
ttultimate punishment for our so-called
tt"sins."  Maybe we should all just have
ttfun and do whatever the hell we want.

tA hubbub is raised by the crowd.  Fitzie raises the roof
tagain, this time energetically.

<b>ttttCARDINAL
</b>ttAmen to that.  Let the sin begin!

tThe hubbub grows to a roar.  Several PEOPLE start fighting
tover the money in the collection plate.

tThe Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.  We hear the
tCardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.

<b>ttttADRIAN (O.S.)
</b>ttOh, this is delicious.

<b>tON MAYOR
</b>
tHe's smirking.  WE HEAR his telepathic response.

<b>ttttCASSIUS (O.S.)
</b>ttt(laughing)
tt"Let the sin begins" - that was a good
ttone.

<b>ttttADRIAN (O.S.)
</b>ttWell, we must get people sinning if we
ttwant to fill up our New Hell.  How are
ttthings going down at City Hall?

<b>ttttCASSIUS (O.S.)
</b>ttI lowered the drinking age to ten.

<b>ttttADRIAN (O.S.)
</b>ttBrilliant.  This is so much fun.  I
ttnever want it to end.

<b>ttttCASSIUS (O.S.)
</b>ttWhy should it end?  Who's gonna stop us?

tThe Mayor/Cassius laughs.  As he does, his eyes slowly cross.

<b>tEXT. STREET - DAY

tBeefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.  PAN OVER TO:

tNicky, his pants around his ankles.  He's trying to do the
tsame.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttThis is intense!  And it happens every
ttday?  Sometimes twice?  I gotta tip my

</b>ttCome on, there's like ten million people
ttin this city and the clock is ticking.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttWell, let's rock and roll.

tNicky looks at the next person walking by.  It's a CHINESE
tDELIVERY GUY on a bicycle.  Nicky clotheslines him, taking
thim off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock.

<b>ttttNICKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttGet in the bottle.  Dad's falling apart.
ttYou froze the gate and you're killing

tNicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips.

<b>ttttCHINESE DELIVERY GUY
</b>ttI'm not thirsty!  I'm not thirsty!

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttjust get in the flask!

tThe Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick
tto the head and runs away.  Nicky gets up.

<b>ttttNICKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttAdrian and Cassius!  You think a kick to
ttthe head is gonna make me throw in the
tttowel?  Well, in the immortal words of
ttJudas Priest, "You got another thing
ttcomin'."

tBeefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the
tbottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS.

<b>tEXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
tNicky approaches various people as they pass.  (To be shot
tlong lense, real people, real reactions.)

<b>tINT. POPEYE'S - DAY
</b>
tNicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the
tCashier to drink.  The Cashier yanks his head away and gives
tNicky a dirty look.  Nicky shrugs and points to the menu,
tordering some chicken.

<b>tEXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
tnicky walks up to a homeless man.  He thrusts the bottle in
this face.  To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes
tit and drinks.  Nothing happens.  Nicky is baffled.  He tries
tto take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  Finally he
tgrabs it away from him.  The man starts throwing garbage at
tNicky as he walks away.

<b>tINT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY
</b>
tBeefy is looking around for Nicky.  He spots him - inside the
tpolar bear cage.  Nicky approaches the bear holding the
tflask.

<b>tINT. HELL - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
tNicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again.
tThe Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs.

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER

</b>ttBeast.

tThe Monster laughs.

</b>ttAll that running and chasing is making

<b>ttttBEEFY
</b>ttI think we have to work on narrowing

tBeefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores.  He's asleep.
tBeefy sighs.

<b>ttttBEEFY (CONT'D)
</b>ttKid's got a lot of evil in him, just
ttbegging to come out...

tBeefy walks away.

<b>tEXT. VARIOUS CENTRAL PARK LOCATIONS - DAY
</b>
tNicky snores.  Masses of birds fly out of the trees.  Nicky
tsnores.  Squirrels run out of trees.  Nicky snores.

<b>tON WORRIED PEOPLE
</b>
tStaring at Nicky who continues to snore.  Two HEAVY-METAL
tGUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a
tgoofy dance.  They hear something and turn the music down:
tit's the distant sound of Nicky's snore.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttSounds like our devil dance actually
ttworked this time.

<b>ttttJOHN
</b>tt'Bout time...

tNicky snores.  It sounds like "I will eat your hearts."  The
tworried people run away.  Nicky snores.  Children on the
tCarousel, going real fast, upset.  Nicky snores.

tPeter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench.

<b>ttttJOHN (CONT'D)
</b>ttThere's our man.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttMr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties
ttto the dark side.

tA sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky.  He eyes
tthe flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket.

<b>ttttJOHN
</b>ttWhat's with that guy?

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttGotta be one of his disciples or
ttsomething.

tSuddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten
tdrumstick) and runs off.

<b>ttttJOHN
</b>ttYo, man, I think that devil guy just got
ttripped off.

<b>ttttPETER
</b>ttShould we wake him up?

tNicky feels for the flask.  It's gone.

</b>ttOh nooooo....

tFire shoots out of Nicky's mouth.

<b>ttttNICKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttWhich way did he go?

</b>ttDid you check out the dragon mouth?

<b>ttttJOHN
</b>ttThe Dark Prince is here.

<b>tEXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
</b>

tseveral STREET VENDORS who have set up their wares on the
tsidewalk.  PAUSE.  Nicky comes walking back into frame as he
tsees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the
tblanket of the VENDOR.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttHey...

<b>ttttSTREET VENDOR
</b>ttSee something you like, my man?

</b>ttYes.  I would like my flask back.

</b>ttYou callin' me a thief, my man?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttNo, I'm just calling you... a guy who

<b>ttttSTREET VENDOR
</b>ttAnd if that is your so-called "flask,"

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttt(not sure what the answer is)
ttI don't know?

tA YUPPIE JOGGER is checking out the flask.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttYeah, how much for the silver flask
ttthere?

<b>ttttSTREET VENDOR
</b>ttWell, that's a very special item.  The
ttcap itself is one hundred percent

ttthousand dollars.

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttReally.  Where's it from?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttIt was handcrafted in hell by Satan
tthimself and is only to be used for the

<b>ttttMAN
</b>ttReally.  I think we'll let you keep it
ttthen.

</b>ttOkay, now you gone and done it.  You
ttdone messed with my business bitch!

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttSir, I would prefer if you didn't raise

tWe see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.

<b>ttttSTREET VENDOR
</b>ttOh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me?
ttI'll show you some crazy eyes.  Let's
ttget busy.

tThe vendor makes an even crazier face at Nicky and starts
tswinging his fists around.

tNearby, VALERIE, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is
tselling clothes off a spread out blanket.  She notices what's
tgoing on.

tNicky's eyes widen in panic.  Just then, Valerie steps in.

<b>ttttVALERIE
</b>ttExcuse me, does that flask belong to
ttthis man?

<b>ttttSTREET VENDOR
</b>ttt(frustrated)
ttNow you callin' me a thief?  Damn.

<b>ttttVALERIE
</b>ttLook, I know you come out here and sell
ttstolen stuff all the time.  But today,

<b>ttttSTREET VENDOR

<b>ttttVALERIE
</b>ttNo, but maybe that cop over there might

tValerie points to a cop across the street.  The Street Vendor

</b>ttAw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.
ttt(looking at Valerie)
ttAnd you, take your raggedy-ass clothes
ttand find a new corner.  Before I show

</b>ttFine.  I will.

tNicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.

<b>ttttNICKY

<b>ttttVALERIE
</b>ttThat's okay.  I get messed with all the

</b>ttMy dad's in hell, and he's falling

</b>ttIf I don't save him, I don't know what

<b>ttttVALERIE
</b>ttWell, I'm sure a nice southern boy like

tNicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.  He
thands her the half-eaten drumstick.

tAdrian raises his eyebrows.  We see that the homeless lady is

</b>ttWanna hit?

tHands it to him.  He takes it.

</b>ttWhatever.  Knock it back, grab Nicky and

tAdrian smiles at John, then raises the bag.  He stops just
tbefore it hits his lips.  He looks at John curiously.

</b>ttIt is awfully hot down here.  How do you

<b>ttttJOHN
</b>ttWeed lowers the body temperature.

</b>ttThis liquid will probably quench my

</b>ttDefinitely.

<b>ttttJOHN
</b>ttAnd give you a good buzz.

</b>ttOr maybe it will trap me inside for all

</b>ttUrrr...uggh...
ttt(as Nicky)
ttOww.  Adrian, this is very painful.

tNicky comes flying out.  John's body slumps to the floor next
tto the chief's.  Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see
tthe flask wrapped in paper.  He peeks inside.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttHello, Cassius.

<b>ttttCASSIUS (O.S.)
</b>ttAll right.  Let me out.

</b>ttYou know, New Hell really only needs one

traises his leg.

</b>ttOh, he's gotta pee.

tA thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the

tNicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from

tsits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there.

tNicky looks around, alarmed.  He seems to be in a mountain
tvale, maybe in the foothills of the Alps.  It's gorgeous.

tOff in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday
tcake.  Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating
tdown to him.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttThe home of eternal damnation, house of

</b>ttMaybe try the opposite of that.

tThe Angel and two friends laugh and high-five.  Nicky's
tconfused.

</b>ttOkay, can I just ask you something?
ttWhat do you know about your mom?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttMy brothers told me my mother was a

<b>ttttGATEKEEPER
</b>ttYou'll get nothing out of me.

</b>ttPerhaps a titty twister will loosen your

tHe twists a breast.  The Gatekeeper babbles out the

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttKeep it up and I just might make you my
ttQueen for a night or two.

<b>ttttJOHN
</b>ttYou want a queen?  Got one right here.

tJohn points at Todd.  They laugh.  Adrian gets closer to
tValerie.  Just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder.
tHe looks down to see:

tNicky standing there with his army.

<b>ttttADRIAN (O.S.)
</b>ttLittle Nicky.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttAdrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the
ttname of all that is good: release my
ttfriends and get in the flask.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttIs this a joke?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttNo.  It's the inner light.  And with it
ttwe can defeat anything you've got.

<b>ttttREFORMED DEMON
</b>ttt(eating Popeye's chicken)
ttIt's true!

tAdrian glares down at the REFORMED DEMON.  His eyes shoot out
tan evil ray.

tThe Reformed Demon explodes into a million pieces.  His
tgolden insides splatter on the crowd.

tThe Army of Good is shaken.  Another Demon lowers his
tchicken.

<b>ttttANOTHER REFORMED DEMON
</b>ttIt's not true?

tThe BUCKET OF CHICKEN sprouts legs and runs away.  Nicky
tsteps forward bravely.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttOkay, Adrian, you've left me with no
ttchoice.

tNicky leaves frame and he flies up towards Adrian.

<b>t EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tNicky lands on both feet standing before Adrian.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttLove lifts me up where I belong.

<b>tANGLE ON
</b>
tCrowd reacts.

<b>tON HELL STAGE
</b>
tDemons are ready to attack.  Adrian waves them off.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttNot bad, little brother.  Let's see what
ttyou've got.

tNicky thinks, holds out his hands.  A rainbow shoots out onto
tthe stage between them.  PAUSE.  We see that a cute little
tchipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut.

<b>tON CROWD
</b>
tThe army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see
tthis.

<b>tBACK ON HELL STAGE
</b>
tAdrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out.
tHe has made a terrible PYTHON that comes over and eats the
tbaffled chipmunk in one bite.

tNicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of
tflowers.

tAdrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a
tlawn mower comes by and mows them down.

tNicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER
tpushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage.

tAdrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who
tleaps out and starts beating up on the mother.

tNicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF.  The evil Dwarf
tstops beating her up and holds her hand.

<b>ttttADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>ttEnough.  I'm going to kill you with my
ttbare hands.

tAdrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw.  He goes flying off the
tplatform.

tNicky's body falls towards the ground.  It's about to hit,
twhen a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall.

<b>tINT. HEAVEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tWe now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and SEVEN OTHER GIRLS
twatching the action on the table.

<b>ttttANGEL
</b>ttI totally had to do that.

<b>ttttALL THE GIRLS
</b>ttYah you did.

tCHUBBS is there, too.

<b>tEXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT
</b>
tNicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him.  Nicky
trolls away at the last second.  Adrian hits the bed hard and
tbounces up.  Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back
tdown into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.  Nicky holds
tout the flask.

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttNow I'm asking you nicely, get in the
ttflas...

tAdrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face,
tsending him flying off the bed.

<b>ttttNICKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttOh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!

tNicky is an expert pillow fighter.  He lands a series of
tawesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves.  Adrian is dazed.

tNicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air
tto him.  Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it
tlands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face.  Adrian goes
tdown hard.  Nicky towers over him.

<b>ttttNICKY (CONT'D)
</b>ttNow will you get in the flask?

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttAbsolutely not.

tAdrian turns to his demons.

<b>ttttADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>ttA little help over here.

tA bunch of Demons advance.

<b>tON FLAGPOLE
</b>
tWe see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run
tover and lowers the five from the flagpoles.

<b>tON ADRIAN
</b>
tHe looks up and glares at Henry.

<b>ttttADRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>ttHenry!

<b>tON FLAGPOLE
</b>
tHenry's eyes widen.

<b>ttttHENRY WINKLER
</b>ttOh no.

tHe is covered in bees again.

<b>tBACK ON ADRIAN
</b>
tHe turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by
tdemons.  Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't
topen his mouth.

tAdrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his
tmouth.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttGoodbye, Nicky.

tWe hear CASSIUS banging against the walls.

<b>ttttCASSIUS (O.S.)
</b>ttCome on in, bro.

tNicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.  Adrian jams
tthe flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in.
tAdrian smiles.  But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to
tgrab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him.

tAs the flask hits the ground, we HEAR:

<b>ttttCASSIUS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>ttThank you, Nicky.  Cause now I'm gonna
ttbust Adrian's head wide open.

<b>ttttADRIAN (O.S.)
</b>ttI was going to let you out, eventually,
ttCassius.  I swear.

<b>ttttNICKY (O.S.)
</b>ttSole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I
ttheard him keep saying.

tWe HEAR the sounds of a struggle.

tAll the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large
tcircle around the flask.  Valerie and the gang make it down
toff the stage.

tWe HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump.  The crowd
tREACTS.  A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a
thorrible thud.

<b>ttttVALERIE
</b>ttNicky!

<b>ttttNICKY (O.S.)
</b>ttThat was Cassius!

tThe FLASK starts rolling over and over on the road.  People
tget out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the
tstreet.  They root for their side.

<b>ttttDEMON
</b>ttKill him, Adrian.

tJohn and Peter start beating up the Demon.

<b>tINT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tThe Angel and the Friend are praying.

<b>tEXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
tWe HEAR banging and beating and yelling from inside and then
tthe flask stops bouncing.  SILENCE.  Everybody outside holds
ttheir breath.  Slowly out of the spout crawls NICKY.

tHOORAY.  Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living
tpeople CHEER.  The student, very happy, opens his kimono.
tThe people and demons near him are grossed out.

tValerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him.

<b>ttttVALERIE
</b>ttWhere'd a sweet Southern boy learn to
ttfight like that?

<b>ttttNICKY
</b>ttFrom my dad's side of the family.

tShe laughs and kisses him on the mouth.  The crowd CHEERS.
tBut Nicky won't stop kissing her.  She starts to struggle for
tair.  Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh.

tThe crowd stops CHEERING.  Valerie is waving her arms for
thelp.  Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss.  Adrian lets
ther go.  And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh.

<b>ttttADRIAN
</b>ttWhat?  No tongue?

tAdrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns
tinto a GIANT BAT.  He lets out a huge roar, then flies
taround, laughing, scaring people.

tValerie runs over and picks up the flask.  She looks inside.

<b>ttttVALERIE
</b>ttt(whispering)
ttNicky. Nicky.

tNo response.

<b>ttttVALERIE (CONT'D)
</b>ttYou gotta fly out...I know you can do
ttit.
ttt(still no response)
ttDo it for the butterflies.

tA long beat, then:

<b>ttttNICKY (O.S.)
</b>ttButterflies...

tAnd Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands
ton his feet.  Adrian lands and stares down Nicky.  The clock
tis one minute from midnight.

tAdrian swoops down.  Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the
tBALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.  Out of
tit forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.

<b>ttttOZZY
</b>ttHello, New York.

<b>ttttJOHN AND PETER
</b>ttOzzy.

tThey faint.

tThe Bat's eyes go wide in fear.  Ozzy grabs the bat, his
tmouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.  Valerie
thands Ozzy the flask.

<b>ttttVALERIE
</b>ttPut him in, Ozzy.

tOzzy spits the bat head into the flask.
